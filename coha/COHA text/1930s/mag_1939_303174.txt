( See Cover ) <P> He was a husky , solemn , shock-headed kid of 6 when he first decided there was money to be made in the quantity production of flying machines . That was 47 years ago in wind-whipped Liberal , Kans. , where his father , Clarence Martin , had set up one of the first hardware stores in the Sunflower State 's southwest . Working from the time school was out until bedtime , Martin 's son , Glenn Luther , methodically turned out biplane box kites at the rate of three a day , sold them for 25 apiece . <P> Last week the Kansas kite builder got an order for some more of his quantity-produced flying machines . The U. S. Army bought a half-million dollars ' worth* of Martin 167 attack bombers , two-engine ships that can streak through the air at 360 m.p.h. , tote a ton of bombs , maneuver against the nimblest pursuit ship in the air . It was no two-bit order , but it was not big enough to give pleasure to Glenn Luther Martin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the War Department simultaneously placed with his big competitor , Douglas Aircraft Co. of Santa Monica , Calif . But the fact that he did not get the big order was not even a serious setback to Glenn Martin today . His $10,000.000 plant outside Baltimore had just delivered 117 B10 bombers to The Netherlands , was working on a ten-million dollar order for new gull-winged flying boats for the Navy , 215 of the 167 bombers for France . Altogether his backlog of orders came to $39,500,000 worth of planes . With the new contract , however , the biggest plane manufacturing backlog , $48,000,000 , glows in Rival Douglas ' fireplace . <P> Mother 's Boy . A stoutish , purse-mouthed man who looks out of shining spectacles with an amiably deliberate expression , Glenn Martin is exhibit A1 of what a human being can do by channeling all his time and talent in one direction . From his earliest kite-making days , he has been a no-nonsense man . When he was a youngster he promised his mother he would not drink until he was 21 ; at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too poor and busy in his youth to smoke , nor does he yet . He never had much time for women , has never married . <P> Minta Martin had a dream before Glenn 's birth that she was up in a flying machine , a circumstance which probably gives Glenn Martin title to the earliest aeronautical propensity in the airplane business . She gave him a sheet to sail his wagon before the Kansas wind . She saw him begin to tinker with machinery and at night read him newspaper articles about the flight experiments of Chanute and Lilienthal . She was just as pleased when he made himself an expert mechanic by working in a garage as she was when he studied business at Kansas Wesleyan . <P> Glenn 's father liked it better when the Martins moved to Santa Ana , Calif , and Glenn began making $3,000 to $4,000 a year selling Fords and Maxwells . When Glenn began making gliders in his garage , Father Martin 's eyebrows raised . When Glenn rented an abandoned Methodist church , locked the doors , painted the windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N motor , began to construct an airplane , his alarmed father thought Glenn had taken leave of his senses . <P> Mother Martin did not . She used to carry the coal-oil lamp around at night while Glenn climbed about his contraption , gluing fabric on the wings , varnishing the struts.
