Now &; then the big , boisterous States of the Australian Commonwealth think for themselves . Two years ago New South Wales tried to repudiate the interest on its State debt ( TIME , April 6 , 1931 et seq . ) . The Crown-appointed Governor finally forced the Premier , tall , square-jawed John Thomas Lang , out of office ( TIME , May 23 ) . Last week the Commonwealth 's biggest and rawest state , Western Australia , voted to secede from the Commonwealth . <P> The State of Western Australia is a vast semidesert as big as Western Europe . Separating it from the rest of Australia are 800 miles of uninhabited country . Among the jack rabbits , kangaroos and kookaburra birds that laugh hysterically and swallow snakes , live half a million farmers who till the fertile belt so successfully that they produce more than one fourth of Australia 's wheat . Western Australians have long looked sideways at the Commonwealth 's densely populated states , at the Eastern manufacturers who profit from the Commonwealth 's high tariff , at the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War . To humor their grudge , the State Legislature last December scheduled a state-wide referendum on two choices : 1 ) a Commonwealth convention to revise the Constitution ; 2 ) secession from the Commonwealth . The rest of Australia remained calm at Western Australia 's threat to jump off the edge of nowhere . Wartime Premier William Morris Hughes called secession " a crude and futile expedient . " The Attorney General told the farmers that the Commonwealth Constitution provided no means by which a state could legally secede . The Commonwealth Premier Joseph Aloysius Lyons went to reason with them and they hooted him out of the State . Their own Premier Sir James Mitchell came out for secession . Their customs revenues continued to go to the Commonwealth , by their contention , to develop the other states . <P> Last week the embattled farmers paradoxically voted Premier Mitchell out of office in the Government elections , plumped strongly for secession . The Labor Party , which is against secession , but is also against Premier Mitchell 's policy of wage reduction , won a majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done about secession , called the vote a " protest , not a decision .
