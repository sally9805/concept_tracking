BREATHES there a man ? breathes there a woman ? with soul so dead as never to have thrown a plate across the table at the graciously condescending person who has just remarked , " Why , nobody would ever think you were an American ! " When I was younger that well-meant phrase roused me to throw metaphorical plates , to boil inwardly , to stamp away , to slam doors behind me .

You know what I said , " Well , who 'd ever think that man was English !

Who was I to resent the phrase , " Nobody would ever think you were an American , " with its clearly understood implication : " Unlike your fellow-countrymen , you respect grammar , never say , ' Whoopee ' or ' 0 .

And when a foreigner tries his hand at the same game about our nation , have we the face to cry out at his obvious shocking injustice ? " At first sight it looked very familiar ? and hopeless . Just another manifestation of plain human cussedness about which there is no arguing . But the change away from the " God-Ithank-thee " attitude to the honest humility of " Lord be merciful " carries one a long way towards a little fairness and understanding of human nature .

Mr. Emmet , your neighbor , stops his car and calls out , " I 'm going down to the station to meet the six-ten , and I 'll bring Ned home for you . Might as well , since I 'm going anyhow . It 'll save you the trip . " You do not as a natural way of praising his thoughtful friendliness shout heartily back , " Well , well , who 'd ever dream you were Roland Emmet !

If we could find out the bad mental habits back of that injustice perhaps we could find out a way to pry those hateful tentacles loose ? at least from our own hearts . And that would be worth doing . For as long as they are fixed there they suck away every faint beginning of international understanding and friendliness .

" They certainly show , do n't they , that cosmopolitan good feeling is common enough ? I thought of that apparent contradiction , too , and explored it for a moment . But it turned out , of course , to be only a by-pass of the main road leading to the same horrid goal of offensive complacency and unfairness . Such people , the fanatic converts to one or another civilization not their own by birth , do not judge any nation more fairly than the rest of us .

" I could spare H no more time to these perverse transplanted jingoes , for through the fog of my discouraged bewilderment I thought I saw looming vaguely ahead a " principle . " I do n't know what your definition of a principle is ; I define it as a tool which helps me make sense out of a mass of facts till then chaotic . When I finally caught up to this principle it turned out not such a very big one , nothing grand or epic about it ; it never would have dug the Panama Canal . But it was big enough for my purpose .

There are in your mind , too , I am sure , just such uncatalogued heaps of inexplicable facts . Have n't you wondered , sometimes with laughter at his absurdity , sometimes with profanity at the bad blood he stirs up , how the American traveler , after an expensive round of Paris-pleasures-for-safe , can have the nerve to report ( as he often does ) that " French women " are heartless gold-diggers ? Have n't you turned the same wonder , laughter , and profanity on the French lecturer , who after a flight across country , or a month or two in New York , writes a book to show that " American women " are heartless gold-diggers ? Have n't you asked yourself , not rhetorically but in honest amazement , how people can be so outrageous as to apply to other nations a method of judging which , when applied to their own , they recognize as downright unfair ?

You are annoyed perhaps by this aged , fly-specked caricature but you do not take it seriously . Because the moment it is brought out in your presence your mind flies to the flesh-and-blood American business men you really know , all of them something more than successful industrialists ; one is a collector of first editions , another a Gibraltar of helpfulness to local social service , an expert on the wild-life of his region , an explorer of some phase of American history , or a pretty good second violin in a string quartette . But wait a moment before you congratulate yourself on your wisdom .

Why , only this last summer when I was visiting a Danish friend near Copenhagen , did n't she ask me challengingly , " You 're always standing up for the French . I want to ask you straight ? could you have brought yourself ever to marry a Frenchman ? " I could see that she felt for a decent woman there could be but one answer , " No , heavens , no ! Of course not . " Through my mind ran the thought of one after another of the serious , exemplary Frenchmen of my acquaintance , devoted , magnanimous husbands , delightful companions , impassioned fathers . But I did not try to convert her , for even as I recoiled from the injustice of her prejudice , I thought , " If she had asked me if I could ever have married a Bulgarian , would n't my instant impulse have been to answer , " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danish friend is one of the wisest , most deep-hearted women I know . And I do n't consider myself altogether provincial , either . How had we two , on most subjects open-minded , strayed so far from fairness ? We have plenty of company , and of the best . In the last book of Georges Duhamel ? one eloquent wail of sorrow over Christopher Columbus ' betrayal of humanity ? he recounts the following incident as part of the evidence he collected here of the loathsome , hypocritical , Puritanical spirit of America . The fine , distinguished woman who was secretary of the Maison Franeaise of Columbia received for him some mail from France . Knowing that he was anxious about the health of a member of his family , she went with it herself down to the Pennsylvania Hotel , where he was staying , and ? presumably to spare him the shock of receiving bad news in the midst of strangers ? took it up to his room . One of the letters did announce the death he feared . While he was still holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central office of the hotel called his room by telephone , told him that men guests are not allowed to take women to their rooms , and would the strange lady seen entering his bedroom please go away . The little episode is recounted with the dramatic skill of the wonderfully gifted writer that Duhamel is , charged to the last word with his power for making his readers share the suffering of his heroes . You , the reader , stand there , too , staring at the tragic words , your heart wrung with grief , your thoughts far on the other side of the Atlantic , with the stricken family there . Your nerves as well as his are shattered by the hateful , intrusive American jangle of the telephone . Only halfconscious of what you are doing , you take down the receiver and , with him , you shudder at the brutality of the insulting suspicion that lies back of the brusque summons in the harsh foreign language . You are swept along over the edge to the conclusion where Duhamel wants to land you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be subjected to such a humiliation is indeed a crass , coarse , materialistic , hypocritical place which it was a great mistake ever to have discovered . What is wrong with this picture ? Well , one thing that is wrong with it is that good European hotels are n't any too enthusiastic about having men guests receive women in their bedrooms . Even the Grand Hotel of Vicki Baum , which certainly did not err on the side of Puritanism , drew the line at women secretaries in business men 's bedrooms . Still more to the point , in M. Duhamel 's home country the better class of cafe will not allow a woman alone , or with another woman , to sit down to a table and order a glass of lemonade ( or anything else ) no matter how thirsty she is . Many and many an American schoolteacher , in France to absorb some of that fine civilization she has heard so much about , stopping at a cafe to get a drink of something cool on a hot day , has shuddered as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on being told plainly by the garcon that they do not serve women unaccompanied by men ; the presumption of the country being that women who go alone to cafes are prostitutes , likely to annoy men patrons with solicitations . I have heard women recounting the humiliation to which they have been subjected , claim passionately that a country where such a thing could happen to a sensitive , self-respecting woman can be nothing but a putrid mass of moral corruption , just as they always heard before going there . Strange , is n't it , that Duhamel in holding up the Pennsylvania Hotel rule as proof of depraved Anglo-Saxon hypocrisy , should ignore the strikingly similar rule in Parisian cafes ; strange that the school-teachers crying out upon French foul-mindedness should forget that in parallel circumstances their own country is as suspicious as any other ! III It is more than strange , it is illuminating . Just set those two oddly assorted shudderers side by side before you and look at them with an analytical eye . Look at them fairly , even if you think them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial traveler in M. Duhamel 's place would not have registered indignation and a lasting hatred of the United States . Instead he would have laughed the matter off with some such words as , " Trot along , Cutie . Anthony Comstock down in the office has got us wrong , but just the same , beat it . " And at the cafe any of the youngish American women who try to keep in water hot enough to boil them might have taken the hint that she was no better than she should he as a welcome tribute to the chicness of her costume and make-up . Still the fact remains that our sensitive , not-at-all-hardboiled M. Duhamel and the schoolteacher did suffer and were perfectly right in feeling wounded and resentful . But they were hardly right in jumping to the conclusion that their suffering was caused by a beastliness peculiar to the country each was visiting . Why did they jump to that conclusion ? Well , the first reason that leaps to visibility , of course , is that each found in the visited country just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that the American school-teacher 's mind , before ever she saved up her passage money , was loaded to the gunwales and awash with the tradition of French immorality . And with all due respect to M. Duhamel 's very superior mind , we may be equally sure that any Frenchman brings with him to the U. S. A. an attitude very receptive to any evidence of Puritan nasty-niceness . After all what happened to them ? It was about the same thing , was n't it ? Each was humiliated by being told by a foreigner that he ( or she ) , a decent , self-respecting person , had by a harmless , unconsidered action quite natural under the circumstances , put himself in a position which by the dirty-minded custom of the country laid him open to the suspicion of sexual irregularity . Their very reactions are similar , Each hates and despises the country where the humiliation happened . Each refuses to believe that anything similar could happen in the homeland . Why , oh why , that last assumption ? Yes , yes , patience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the best pedagogic practice I am taking you through the steps which led me to it . We have seen that on arriving in the country each held a prepared label in his hand , ready-licked so to speak , to paste on whatever happened . But much more than this , it is quite possible , it is probable , it is almost certain that they did not consciously and unfairly turn their eyes away from the custom in their own country corresponding to the one they encountered abroad , because they honestly had never heard of it ? or so vaguely that it made no personal impression on their minds . How would the American school-teacher ever have run into that rule in American hotels ? It is the rarest thing in the world for her , I am sure , to go to a hotel in the States at all , and it certainly never would occur to her to invite a strange gentleman to come up to her bedroom . In fact , though I am past fifty and have been around to American hotels myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hotel , I never heard of that rule till I read about it in the book of the French traveler . I ask you , how should I ? On the other side , M. Duhamel has certainly sat down a great many times at a caf ? table to order a cool drink on a hot day . But he probably would have heard vaguely if at all of the reception given self-respecting American school-teachers who try to do the same thing . How would he ? No French school-teacher or any other well-bred French woman of any class would get into such a situation . If she wanted a cool drink , she 'd step into a pcitisserie , where she would be welcome . Everybody knows his way around his own country and does not step through those invisible high-tension wires which fence off what " is done " from what " is n't done . " But when he is in a foreign country he does n't see them till he has blundered through and is writhing in misery from the consequent electric shock . All travelers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries in positions which do not correspond with anything that ever happens to them in their own . But humans ? you know their habits ? can not encounter a thing , not the smallest thing , without passing judgment on it . We are made that way . For good and for bad , that is one of our most marked qualities . And you ca n't judge anything unless you have something to compare it with . So our wounded or indignant or contemptuous travelers usually ? faute de mieux ? compare what happens to them in a foreign country with something entirely different from it in their own . And there 's my principle . I 'll put it like a mathematical formula . " Much , perhaps most , international misunderstanding and dislike is not inherent and inevitable , but comes from the comparison of customs and people in our country not with corresponding customs and people in another , but with others totally different " I 'll make it clearer . Since everything is put down in graphs nowadays , I 'll make a graph of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . What the enlightened , perfectly just ( and almost nonexistent ) tourist should do , in judging the customs of the country where he is visiting , is expressed in the following graph , in which A represents the foreign custom he is trying to evaluate , and A ' the corresponding custom in his own country , and the other letters , 1:1 , C ' , D ' , other customs , that have no relation to the one he is encountering . The straight line drawn from a foreign custom to the one corresponding to it in America expresses , of course , the route that should be traveled by the fair-minded traveler . The graph below expresses the route his mind usually does follow . Perhaps you can follow me better if I diagram a concrete case already familiar to you , the American visitor to Montmartre night life . He feels the impulse , universal , human , inevitable , to make some estimate of the life he is encountering . Now you can estimate or measure a thing only by setting it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . As a standard of comparison for the night-life women in Paris , the visiting American knows , say , the night-life women of New York , the women who taught school when he went to school , the women eniployees in his office , his own mother , wife , and daughter , etc. , etc . With no more explanation of my principle , I can trust you to draw his line anywhere but straight across to where it should go . Just draw it anywhere you think he 's likely to have drawn it and see graphically what is wrong with that man 's report on what " French women " are like . Here 's another concrete case , in which I applied the principle and the graph to my own enlightenment , this very day . I was reading a witty , Heinelike article by a German about France , about the fact that whoever fights France must be prepared to find God on the other side , about the complacent French assumption that whoever fights for France fights for humanity , etc. , etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew of embattled French self-righteousness , the likeness was so deftly caught . But after a time , I stopped reading to exclaim , " But see here ! How ever has he the nerve to consider that characteristic of the French alone ! Did n't he ever hear about Gott rnit uns , and unser alte Deutsche Gott ? Not to speak of English cathedrals ringing sonorously with the certainty that God is in danger when England is . How can a man have . . . " But , of course , I saw at once how he could . He had drawn his line crookedly , namely from the large number of self-centered , savagely nationalistic people in France , not to the similar large group in his own country with exactly similar views , but to the small number of broadminded , fair people capable of seeing the murderous absurdity of such national self-glorification . And having hidden from his vision in this way the existence of a small gioup in France , just as broad and internationally minded as the similar circle in Germany , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear and open the road to hell with a perfectly good conscience . Our unfortunate American schoolteacher got herself misunderstood and insulted by assuming in her mental graph that a smart French cafe is equivalent to an American soda water fountain , which is about as sensible as to assume that a leopard , because it has four legs like a lap dog , can be treated in the same manner . IV I said that the fair-minded traveler is almost non-existent , almost but not quite . M. Dubrueil represents the intelligent minority . A French skilled mechanic , he came to this country and worked in various factories ( Ford 's among others ) to see for himself the life the American workingman really leads . His graphs are not crazy quilts . He draws them with the skill and intelligence of a craftsman . On one page he describes the Sunday of an American working family . They spend their morning like dumb driven cattle , reading the comic strips in the newspapers and listening to the radio . After dinner they sit for a while , listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barren of any inner resources , incapable of any conversation except trivial personalities , leave the house and climb into yet another machine in which they spend the rest of the day , racing through scenery at which they do not look . So far his account sounds exactly like the usual European recipefor pictures of American life ? the main ingredients of the dish being plenty of stupefying mechanism well stirred together with ignorance , seasoned by the European cook with contempt and a dash of fear , and served piping hot . But M. Dubrueil gives an ' O. Henry twist at the end simply by drawing his line with accuracy straight across the Atlantic . He does not compare this family with a group of intellectuals in Paris ( as subconsciously most French writers do because that is the group they personally know ) but with a similar workingman 's family such as he alone among French writers on America has lived with . In France he tells us such a family would not have any radio , phonograph , or Ford car . But it would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porch with the wife and children of a summer evening and calling across to your next-door neighbor once in a while is flat and banal and American , but the talk is about on a level with that of a French family of the same class sitting around that much admired center of civilization , a table in a cafe . Civilized , cultivated conversation is everywhere , alas ! restricted to very small groups , and most of the time even they do n't bring it off . But my Danish friend , my wise , fine Danish woman , who has as a matter of fact scarcely traveled at all in France and has never personally had a French friend , how can my formula and my graph apply to her ? Ah , so easily , so completely , even more perfectly than in any other ease . She , like hundreds and thousands of well-read people , was making the fatal , the abysmal mistake of comparing people she met in foreign books with the real people in her own country . Ah , what a fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The greatest . And we all do it . Even those who have written books themselves commit that fault , although they , if anybody , ought to know bow little the people in books represent the general run of humanity as it is found . We are never sufficiently on our guard against the danger of judging foreign countries from their fiction because we are never seriously misled by the people in the books of our own native tongue . As we read , we mentally set back of them and around them the millions of real people who , if they existed in real life , would surround , modify , and dilute them to a recognizable humanity . But when we see them in a foreign book we take them for all there is . A Frenchman turns from Flaubert 's white-hot indictment of small-town narrowness , meanness , stupidity , cruelty , and aridity of soul , as shown in Madame Bovary , saying to himself , " What a strong , true picture of one aspect of human nature . " The same man lays down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature ! " Do you read Scandinavian fiction ? If you do , you must have noticed what violent , dark , morbid goings-on fill the days in the old Nordic part of Europe . Infanticide , melancholia , brooding , murderous moods , religious mania , all-pervading despair is the chief of their diet , is n't it ? My Danish friend , of course , also reads and admires those books . But she knows perfectly well what relation they bear to the reliable , pleasant-mannered good citizens in real life all around her , devoted to their healthy , fun-loving children , fond of their wives , good bridge players , with tennis courts on their lawns , wet bathing suits hanging on the line , civilized books on their shelves , and radio loudspeakers in their living rooms . Yet she goes right on comparing the Frenchmen she meets in books , subtle , devilish , sex-tormented fellows , not with the Scandinavians she meets in books , but with her own agreeable circle of Nordic friends , relatives , and neighbors . Her graph line being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oddest conclusions about the French ? as odd as those we have about Scandinavians or those held by the French about America . Do I mean that people are just alike everywhere , with no national traits at all ? That 's a rhetorical not a real question on your part . You know I ca n't mean that . Even if , as the Watsonites would have it , a Chinese baby and a Norwegian baby are made of the very same protoplasm ( or whatever it is Watson thinks babies are made of ) , Norway and China soon arrange that protoplasm into different patterns . I mean that we ca n't make the faintest beginning at accuracy in knowing anything about national traits , customs , habits , or individuals as long as we keep trying to measure the flavor of string beans by comparing it to the rain-resisting qualities of roofing paper , so to speak . I mean considerably more than that , too , as I hope you 'll see in a moment . We can not have the most approximate idea of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all our fibers , that it is made up of all kinds of folks ; that , for instance , France is not inhabited solely by French people but mostly by human beings . We shall always harbor absurd and unfair ideas of other peoples and other races so long as we think we know something about any given individual human being when we have been told what his race or nationality is , instead of comprehending that we still know nothing , nothing , nothing ! One authentic fact about him himself , the smallest , the most baroque ? such as that be is apt to be late at appointments , or that he likes green neckties ? gives you just one hundred per cent more reliable information about the flesh-and-blood individual he is than to know that he is Swedish , or Swiss , or Jewish . Because , doggedly as our minds set themselves against the idea , there are all kinds of Swedes and Swiss and Jews . Perhaps one reason why we so mulishly balk at this idea is that we do not really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We know , of course , there are in our own nation a great many people who are " not our kind . " Pennsylvania believers in witchcraft and hex-masters , Southern lynch-mobs , New England back-road degenerates , California religious maniacs , to mention a few . But when we speak of " Americans " we do n't include them . We mean by Americans those we know , and we naturally gather around us those who are our kind , because we do n't like to have anything to do with the others if we can help it . It does not occur to us , for instance , to look about . us in the day-coach of a railway train , or in the subway , or on the station-platform of a country junction , to " see what Americans look like . " We already know what Americans look like ? our kind ; and we keep our eyes glued to our magazine .

There we sit , wide-eyed and observant , note-book in hand ? French in America , Americans in France , everybody away from home anywhere ? drawing graph lines that look like the trail of intoxicated serpents , and writing rapidly home about what foreign parts are really like . Dubreuil , the philosophic French mechanic , points out that most French observers and commentators on American industrial life are singularly handicapped by a lack of the slightest acquaintance with French machine shops , that most of the French literary and academic visitors who shudder over a visit to the soulless hell of the Ford factory are in their own minds corn-paring it to their own pleasant studies or lecture-rooms , not at all to a French automobile ( or any other ) factory , because mostly they have never set foot in one , let alone never having done a lick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And those other untraveled but well-read French people , pitying us for living in a country so under the heel of tyrannical public opinion that Babbitts must conform to the pattern or perish ? just let them leave their big-city , impersonal Paris life , where they can do as they please for the sole reason that they can keep people not their kind from knowing about it , move into a French small town of marked clerical tendencies , and invite the nice teacher in the public school to tea ! Ah , if we could but hold our pencils from drawing graph lines when we have no idea which way to point them , what a long step forward in international good feeling would have been made ! For it is my opinion that the longed-for breakdown of narrow , hateful nationalism , which must come if we are to escape poison-gassing one another off the globe altogether , can never come as idealists would have it , by a warm-hearted , world-wide recognition that all men are brothers . In the first place , because we are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the second place because all men are not brothers , nor anything like it . It would be impossible for us to love all humanity , and knowing more human specimens through more travel is not going to turn that trick , rather the contrary if we ca n't find a " principle " to sort out facts . For one thing , we can love only individuals , not " men " or " women " in a mass , because they do not exist as a mass . Much of our human misery comes because we fail to recognize that there is , accurately speaking , no plural to " child " or " man " or " woman . " A generation of intensive study of child psychology has begun to teach us the danger of laying down rules for the correct treatment of " children . " But we have n't even made a start at realizing that it is equally dangerous to try to pass judgment on " Frenchmen " or " American women . " The ignominious surrender to barbarism involved in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ours on treating other people in the plural , although nothing arouses more hotly one 's own indignation than to be so treated himself . I have said that we can love or be friendly only to individuals . More yet , we are so constituted as to be able to love among individuals only a few people who arc " our kind . " Internationalism solidly based on the realities of human nature can in my opinion only come from the knowledge that , since all nations are made up , like our own , of a jumbled lot of all kinds of specimens , " our kind " are scattered far and wide in all nations , and all races . And that the other kind , the people whose traits are so detestable that we must go to war against them once in a while , are also scattered far and wide over all nations , with a good many of them living on our street , right now . Exhortations to feel friendly toward other nations and other races can not succeed because ? there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly " towards the majority of the human race anywhere . We can refrain from throwing bricks at them , perhaps from a sense of duty , perhaps from a fear that their bricks are bigger than ours ; with an effort we admit theoretically that they have some right to live on the same globe with us ; but we can feel friendly only with people with whom we have a good deal in common . The real harrier to international good-will is that we do not realize that there are such people in every nation and every race on earth . Nor do we realize that the other kind are everywhere . Those hideous faults , and ridiculous flaws , and ugly vices , and bad manners , and cruelties which anybody with half an eye can discover in any country he visits , why does our race , in spite of all protests of hatred for such things , seem to make no headway against them ? Is n't it because we will not look for them where we could find them , but insist on attributing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Of course they evade us . We could pull them out of their lairs and make at least a beginning of strangling them if we resisted with ferocity our human tendency to locate them in someone 's else country , or community , or race , and would attack them where they live , in every human heart .
