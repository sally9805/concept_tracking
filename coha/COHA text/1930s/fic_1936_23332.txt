THE LITTLE BLUE DOG A STORY BY MICHAEL CROWLEY J OHN MURPHY , at the sergeant 's desk , back of the wooden , brown railing , thought that he had never known the Thirty-ninth Street Station to be so deserted . It made him think of a haunted house . The bunch of reporters had all run out on the tail of what looked like a big story up at Hacker and Fiftieth , where a couple of fellows were shooting up a hotel lobby . The incident , in fact , had drained about the last human being from the Station . He tried to think of some time when the place had been so empty and quiet ; but it certainly never had been , not even in the deadest hours of a night shift , There was something uncanny about it . Maybe the dreary , purplish twilight of a winter day carried more elements of ghostliness than the blackest or the wildest midnight Occasional wind gusts rattling glass panes took his thoughts back to the Old Country , where such signs were understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving whirl of dust or feeling a sudden rush of wind , would frown , and say : " Mushal The little people , God bless them , are riding . There 'll be mischief , God forgive me for saying it . " Well , he 'd soon be off for the night . He glanced up at the clock , saw that it was just trembling on the five-forty-five mark . At six o'clock , he 'd be off , and a half to three quarters of an hour later , he 'd be sitting down to one of Mary 's plain , abundant , tasty dinners . It 'd seem good to a man with an empty nine-quart stomach who 'd been driving for thirty minutes through snow , cold , and darkness . He leaned back and stretched . His eyes were on the Station door , but that was merely because the door was in such a position as to impinge on his vision . He was thinking of the hot dinner , and then a quiet evening with Mary , and maybe Tommy if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thorough perusal of the evening paper , conversation , entertainment from the radio ; but mainly warmth , rest , and comfort . Presently the door opened to admit a uniformed officer , Swanson to be exact , and a well-dressed but disheveled man whom he was pulling along with an arm-hold . The man was passively resisting , trying mildly to hold back , Murphy straightened up , reached for his pen , and opened his book . When they reached the desk , Swanson released his hold , and his captive stood quiet , with head clown , looking a little blurred with drink . " Drunk , " Swanson said . " He was kickin ' up a fuss in an apartment house . He 's seem ' things . " " I ai n't drunk , " the prisoner protested . He did not look up . " I was fighting the dog . " " He was seem ' a dog , " Swanson explained . " Makin ' a hell of a racket up in his room , tryin ' to catch this dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and chasin ' it all night . At first , she never wanted to turn him in , because he pays his rent , but I guess it finally got her down . " " What 's your name ? " Murphy asked . " I ai n't drunk , " the prisoner persisted . " This damn dog 's been after me for years . " " What 's your name ? " " Jim Brandon . I had a few drinks , but I ai n't drunk . " You say he lives at this apartment ? " " Yeh , at 3910 Lake . Apt. 303 , " said Swanson . " He 's been hittin ' it pretty hard . Had the whole table full of empties . But he never gave no trouble . " Swanson grinned . " I told him I 'd find him a place where this dog could n't get him . " Swanson paused , added reflectively : " Funny , too . When they 're up to where he is , they 're usually dynamite . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Swanson defiantly . Murphy saw that his eyes were glassy , and that he was strong under the load he was carrying . " I was fighting the dog . I only come with you because you said you 'd put me in a glass house where the damn dog ca n't get in . But , by God , you 'll have to make it frosted glass so it ca n't look inl " " I guess you better have the doc look him over , " said Murphy , his black eyes on Brandon thoughtfully . There was a peculiar look in his gaze . A mere suggestion of a frown was between his eyes . " There was n't any dog around , was there ? " Swanson grinned . " Well , when I went up , the door was shut , and I could hear this guy whistlin ' . . . . You know , little , short whistles like when you call a dog . He did n't pay no answer to my knock , so I tried the door , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bed , leanin ' over like he was tryin ' to call a dog . You know how . Well , he 'd whistle , and snap his fingers , and then he said : ' Here ! Here ! Come here ! ' Then he 'd whistle again . When he seen me , he motioned me back . Said he had to catch this dog , and I 'd crab it . I talked to him about it , and he said this dog had been botherin ' him for years , and he 'd made up his mind to catch it , and wring its neck . But he could n't get it to come up to him , and he could n't grab it when he 'd dive after it . I finally talked him into comin ' along . " " And there was n't any dog ? " Swanson grinned again . At the same time , he looked a little puzzled at Murphy 's interest . " Well , if there was , I could n't see none . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass , " Brandon said . Murphy saw that he was becoming restless ; that there was an erratic flicker in his eyes . " That damn thing ' 11 follow me . I 'm not going to have it looking in , and grinning under its mustache . " Murphy looked at him sharply . " What kind of a dog is it ? " he asked . " Well it 's got long blue hair . " Brandon was looking up eagerly . " The hair drags on the ground when it walks . It 's got red stripes on its back , and it 's about this big . " He leaned over , and held his hand about a foot off of the floor . " It 's kind of a Scottie , only it 's got a man 's face , and it 's got a long , black mustache . You can hear it walking a long ways off . It kind of patters along like in bedroom slippers . I 'm gon na get it , and wring its neck off . " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to listen . " By God , there it comes ! I knew it ! I knew it ! " He whirled toward the door . Swanson put a hand on his shoulder . " I better take him on in , " he suggested . " There it isl " Brandon 's voice shouted . " By God , that thing can open a door like a man ! See it ! See it there ! " Murphy looked at the doorway . He could n't see anything . He could n't see that the door had moved . But had he felt a cold draught of air ? Had the smell of winter come in ? Brandon was down on his knees , holding his hand out . He snapped his fingers , and whistled . Swanson flashed a grin at Murphy , and attempted to drag Brandon to his feet . " Come on . Come on , " he said . " We 're goin ' to that glass house . " " No , by God ! I 'm gon na get that dog ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn youl " The impact of his fist on Swanson 's nose made a smacking sound . Swanson staggered back , sat down violently , his nose spurting blood . Brandon , with an oath , rushed to the door . " Come back here , damn youl I 'll wring your neck ! " There was scarcely a waver in his gait . He reached the door , snapped it open , and disappeared outside . As he ran , he was cursing the dog , shouting at it . Swanson got up , shook his head , swabbed with his hand at the blood . He started hastily in pursuit . Murphy , his frown deepened , glanced around the room thoughtfully , at the windows black with early night , white with winter , occasionally rattling . He shook his head soberly . A dog with a human face and a black mustache . It had long blue hair with red stripes . Red and blue were traditional fairy colors . It was the first time he had ever heard of a dog such as Brandon had described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were even more inclined to mischief than here . He had often pondered on the odd fact that since coming to America he had never seen so much as one fairy . It must be that they just did n't have the urge to make themselves visible , though they played tricks enough on him . In the Old Country , which he had left at twelve years of age , he had once seen a ring of them dancing on a rath . They had all been entirely human looking ; tiny , mischievous fellows in their fine blue clothes and red cocked hats . They had danced around him , making sport of him as he had stood there , an awkward , stupid Gulliver . But since coming to America , he had never once seen any of them in any form . Much less in such a grotesque shape as that of a blue-and-red dog . He glanced around again sharply . He hoped the little blue dog had really run out when Brandon had chased it . He had enough trouble with the little ones that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe make itself visible . He always hated to have these so called D.T. cases come before him . In the first place , he hated to lock a man up for something that certainly was n't his fault . He knew he 'd raise a ruction himself if , besides plaguing him , the fairies would make themselves visible in some of the grotesque forms these poor devils saw them in . Or maybe the little people did n't deliberately make themselves visible . He 'd thought about that quite a lot . Maybe a huge excess of liquor did something to a man 's eyes , made them keener , something like X-rays , so they could see things that ordinarily were invisible . He shook his head . He ought n't to be thinking on the subject , because he 'd noticed that whenever he did , the little people seemed to plague him more than usual . When they read his thoughts , and knew he was in a mood to be teased , they went at it with more gusto . Presently , with the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and relieved him . By the time he 'd left the Station , Swanson had n't yet returned . Apparently the officer was having a tough time picking Brandon up again . Murphy walked to his car and climbed in . The fact that he slipped twice on the icy sidewalk and caught his forefinger in the door showed him that the fairies were intending to make a night of it . He was not surprised when the car took unusually long to start , even for cold weather , nor was he surprised when he ran out of gasoline half way home . The fact that it was a five-block walk to the nearest service station merely proved that the little people were determined to try him to the limit of his endurance . It was unfortunate that it had had to be to his desk that the man with the blue-and-red dog had been brought . He hoped the little dog really had run out , and had n't waited and come along with him . He had been listening subconsciously , as he drove , for the patter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , only to conclude it was the sound of the car in the snow . A red signal at one corner had looked momentarily like a red stripe , and he had been relieved when it dissolved into the familiar traffic light . He was famished , but he was reconciled to being very late for dinner . He crept the car along , and did not try to make up the time lost going for gasoline , because if he did the fairies would involve him in some minor smashup that would delay him still further . They had already skidded the car slightly at two different intersections . Fortunately the particular fairies who plagued him were only mildly spiteful . They never did anything very serious to him . Their worst trick had been about five years ago when they had laid him up with pneumonia . But they had known , of course , that he would recover . They had been merely punishing him for something he had done that had particularly offended them . He had often thought hard , trying to figure what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he had never reached a solution of the problem . He hoped the little blue dog was n't along . If it attached itself to him , he 'd just have to wait and find out what kind of mischief it went in for . It might be a mean fairy , and really do harm . He wished he had had a chance to question Brandon , and find what its tricks were . Maybe , if Swanson caught him , he could question him in the morning . But maybe , after all , the blue dog was n't going to follow him . He felt great relief when he finally drove into the driveway of the four-room house where he lived . When he had got the car put away , and covered with robes , and the garage door locked , he decided that probably the blue dog had n't come along . Nothing had occurred except things that his old fairies were in the habit of doing . He got to the house all right , with only a minor mishap , that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoe . When he got up the steps without slipping , found his key , inserted it in the lock , and opened the door , he breathed a sigh of relief . Once in the dark little suggestion of a hall , with the door closed , he felt safe . The front room , opening before him , was bright and cheerful . He put his cap on the small halltree ; and then Mary appeared , small , plump and warm , and fitted into his arms , and gave him a kiss . He explained why he had been late . " Tommy has a date to-night , " Mary said . " So I let him eat , so he could begin getting ready . But I waited . " He was about to reply , but just as they passed the halltree to go into the dining room , he looked at his old derby , which he had n't worn for five years , and which had been hanging on the halltree for that length of time . The derby quivered a little as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around on its peg . First just creeping , then faster and faster . He frowned in concern . The frown was so prominent as he sat down to the table that Mary noticed and asked : " What 's the matter ? Did n't things go well ? " He wanted to tell her about the little blue dog , but he did n't . Instead he said : " Just the usual humdrum . Nothing 's the matter with me except Ent hungry , and I 'm sore because I forgot how low the gas was . A man in my job ought to learn to keep his wits . " " You do n't seem to be eating much , " Mary observed , after a moment . " I guess I 'm too hungry to eat . " As he spoke , he felt something rubbing against his leg . He jumped , and looked down under the tablecloth . It was only the yellow cat , and it always rubbed against him during meals . Only there had n't ever been a blue dog to worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painstakingly dressed . He was merrily humming a tune . " Hello , dad , " he broke off long enough to say . Then he added : " What 's the matter ? You look wor-ried . " " Nothing . Nothing at all . I just ran out of gas . " Tommy looked at his mother and winked . " Say , dad , " he observed . " You got that same look on like when you 're worrying about the fairies bothering you . Remember , last Christmas when they were whirling your derby around ? " Murphy looked up at him severely . " I told you afterward I was only joking . I was just saying I saw the derby whirling just to fool your Uncle Pat . He 's one of the old Irish , and he believes in such tales . As for me , I never believe in no such ridiculous things . And do n't you go letting your mind dwell on the like . Those are just stories for children , and there 's no truth in ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he cast a nervous glance at the dark little hall , where , hidden in the shadows , his old derby was whirling on its peg .
