To advertise or not to advertise : that question has disturbed the inner calm of the New York Stock Exchange ever since the nation 's first market place began to feel the Depression impact of public hostility . Even after a revolt of the membership boosted Charles R. Gay into presidency of the Exchange on what was supposed to be a New Deal platform , the idea of advertising remained unpalatable to the Governors . It was quite proper that President Gay should stump from coast-to-coast in an effort to " educate " the public . But to do it with the written word , bought &; paid for , seemed to many an oldster on the Floor to be no less shocking than the idea of an advertising campaign in behalf of the Union Club . <P> Nevertheless , the drive for advertising continued under the leadership of Maurice L. Farrell , senior partner of F. S. Smithers &; Co. and chairman of the Exchange 's committee on public relations . An old-time newshawk who was once managing editor of the Wall Street Journal , Broker Farrell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in 144 years , except for a brief period during the War when it unbent as a patriotic duty to participate in prompting the sale of Liberty Bonds , the New York Stock Exchange published paid advertisements. * <P> Neither the campaign nor the copy was precisely breathtaking . It was not a campaign to resell Wall Street to the public along the lines of the National Association of Manufacturers ' current effort to resell " The American Way " ( TIME , Sept. 28 ) . It was not a campaign to drum up business for its members , not even an institutional campaign . In modest little two-column insertions in dailies in the Northeast it was announced that a booklet called The New York Stock Exchange , Its Functions and Operations would be sent free upon request . In the New York Times and Herald Tribune the Exchange got preferred positions on the second or third pages along with the Fifth Avenue Hotel , Knox Hats , Reuben 's and the Brass Rail restaurants . <P> In the next few weeks the advertisement will run in other sections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 400 newspapers . Magazines may be included later . Meantime the first insertions brought a " gratifying " number of requests for the booklet , a 40-page primer of Stock Exchange history , policy and practice illustrated with scenes from the Floor and service departments . The booklet was prepared to be passed out to visitors and to satisfy unsolicited demands for simple explanations of the stockmarket 's how &; why . Most illuminating fact : each of the Pilgrim Fathers ( arriving on the Mayflower in 1620 ) owned at least one share of a subsidiary of Plymouth Co. , then active on the London stockmarket . Each Pilgrim Father also had the right to buy additional Plymouth shares at 10 per share . <P> * In financial columns and market quotations the Exchange gets more free publicity than any business institution in the U. S.
