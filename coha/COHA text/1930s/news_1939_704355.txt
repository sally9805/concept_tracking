txt Thomas E. Dewey 's opening speech in his campaign for the Republican Presidential nomination must have met the best expectations of his wellwishers . He found one of the central weaknesses in the armor of the New Deal and drove his thrust home . In this first speech he quite properly did not attempt to state solutions of specific problems , but raised a basic question : " First of all , we must make up our minds whether we believe in the continued growth of this country or whether we believe we have reached our economic limit . " In discussing this issue Mr. Dewey 's remarks were well-documented . From the report this year of the Temporary National Economic Committee he ? cites this admission : " The American economic machine is stalled on dead center . " He comments : After seven years of lending and spending , seven years of priming the pump , seven years of pushing the accelerator down to the floor on more and more and more public spending , seven years of warming up the cylinders of the machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt  --  after seven years what does the New Deal repair crew tell us ? It admits defeat . Mr. Dewey takes a couple of sentences from an address by President Roosevelt in 1932 : " Our industrial plant is built . The problem just now is whether under existing conditions it is not overbuilt . " Here , comments Mr. Dewey , is the whole economic outlook of the New Deal : " The established plants are all right . But the new plants , the new adventures , the new industries , are unnecessary and even possibly undesirable . " Mr. Dewey proceeds to dig up a sentence from the annual report of the United States Commissioner of Labor in 1886 : " It is true , " wrote the Commissioner , " that the discovery of new processes of manufacture will undoubtedly continue , but it will not leave room for a marked extension such as has been witnessed during the last fifty years . * * It will not afford remunerative employment for the vast amount of capital that has been created . " Are n't we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put their money into the early hazard of the automobile industry , or that our radio , motion picture and aviation pioneers never read this report ? This is no accidental aberration of the New Deal upon which Mr. Dewey has seized . It is part of a philosophy that has found expression in a score of measures . It is at least a partial explanation of the whole spending program . That program is based partly on the assumption that Government deficit spending is needed to " compensate " for a deficiency in private spending . Some members of the Administration even believe that this deficiency in private demand has become a permanent one , and that consequently permanent deficit spending will be needed to " compensate " for it . Such a policy would lead straight to national bankruptcy . Mr. Dewey declares his faith that the energy of American private enterprise , given an opportunity , can produce employment , generate new purchasing power and set in motion once more a surging flow of commercial venture . It remains to be seen whether Mr. Dewey can subsequently translate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whether he can secure any substantial measure of Republican agreement on those proposals . But his first speech is vigorous and effective .
