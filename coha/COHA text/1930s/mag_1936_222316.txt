Considerably less famed than the Walker and Ryder Cup play between the best U. S. and British male golfers , the biennial Curtis Cup matches are a healthy , respectable female counterpart . Last week in Scotland a picked U. S. team of five oldtimers and 18-year-old Patricia Jane ( " Patty " ) Berg eked out a 4-to-4 tie , retained the trophy , which has yet to leave the U. S. Real winner was par which , ably assisted by the weather , gave both teams a sound trouncing . <P> The rolling beauty of the King 's course at Gleneagles was a dismal sight the day of the matches . Haar , " an especially bad Scottish mist , swept over all 18 holes , limited clear vision to 100 yd . Because a postponement was not considered sporting , the golfers trudged wearily around , got soaking wet , wore fur mittens between shots . Caddies stood ahead as human signposts to mark the direction of the greens . To make matters worse , hungry birds had dislodged old divots in their search for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Star performers for the U. S. did not include Patty Berg but two old standbys , Glenna Collett Vare , six-time U. S. national champion , and Maureen Orcutt Crews , winner of practically every important U. S. tournament but the national . Playing in a Scotch foursome with Patty ( i.e. , hitting alternate shots with one ball ) , Mrs. Vare carried her almost all the way , brought the match to an all-even finish by holing two long putts on the 16th and 17th greens . In her singles match Mrs. Vare conquered British Champion Wanda Morgan 3 and 2 . Mrs. Crews not only won her singles but her foursome match as well . Miss Berg , so nervous that she could not even see the hole when she prepared to putt , lost in the singles , sorely disappointed spectators and newshawks who had ballyhooed her as a links prodigy . <P> Only the play of 21-year-old Jessie Anderson saved the British from open defeat . All-even in the foursomes and leading by one match in the singles , the U. S. needed only a tie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This seemed assured when Mrs. Leona Cheney , all square with Miss Anderson on the 18th green , played her approach shot to within an inch of the cup . Miss Anderson , , however , thoroughly at home in the Scottish mist , laid down a putt which slithered 20 ft. across the soaked green , plopped straight into the cup .
