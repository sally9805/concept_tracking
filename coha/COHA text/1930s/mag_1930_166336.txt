Familiar is the story of the small merchant who , unable to meet his notes , said to his banker : " Were you ever in the pants business ? " The banker replied that he certainly never was . " Well , " said the small merchant , shrugging his shoulders . " you are now . " <P> Often was this story repeated last December ( TIME , Dec. 16 ) when William Fox turned over the management of his cinema business to his bankers and creditors , Halsey , Stuart &; Co. and American Telephone &; Telegraph Co . Last week , however , it appeared that Mr. Fox was not altogether willing to admit that the bond house and the utility company were in the cinema business . Some of Mr. Fox 's stockholders seemed more gravely concerned than ever about their equities in the Fox companies . These stockholders , indeed , threatened a receivership and thereby produced not only a decline in Fox securities but a general bear raid on the entire Market . <P> Fox v. Bankers . Owing some $90,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consented to the formation of a voting trust in which he had one vote , Halsey , Stuart &; Co. one vote , American Telephone &; Telegraph one vote . Halsey , Stuart held Fox notes for $12,000,000 and American Telephone &; Telegraph ( through Electrical Research Products , Inc. ) held notes for $15,000,000 . According to a Halsey , Stuart official , Mr. Fox agreed to turn in the resignations of a majority of the directors of Fox Film Corp . and Fox Theatres Corp . But when the bankers asked for these resignations they were not forthcoming . Inasmuch as the present management can not be displaced until April 15 ( the annual stockholders ' meeting ) Mr. Fox has three and one-half months ' grace . During this period he might , of course , succeed in paying off his notes and resume unquestioned control . So the bankers , who had planned to lend the Fox companies $100,000,000 ( by underwriting an issue of first mortgage bonds ) held up their financing plans and waited to see how successful Mr. Fox might be in getting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both Fox Film Corp . and Fox Theatres Corp . are organized on the basis of 100,000 shares of Class B voting stock and 900,000 shares of Class A non-voting stock , with Mr. Fox and his immediate associates holding the Class B and its attendant control. * Knowing that $900,000 in dividends were coming due Jan. 15 , and that the trustees were planning to merge all the Fox corporations into a single holding company , holders of <P> Fox Film Class A threatened to institute a receivership suit , preferring a public settlement to whatever arrangements Mr. Fox and his bankers might or might not reach . But when Mr. Fox announced that Fox Film assets were $73,000,000 in excess of liabilities , the stockholders , reassured , decided that no immediate receivership was necessary . As another sedative for stockholders , the company also last week announced that it will soon launch a $20,000,000 production schedule , the biggest it has ever undertaken .
