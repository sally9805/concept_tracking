Mrs. Dorothy Steeves is a member of British Columbia 's Provincial Legislature . One day last week she went to bat . She never got to first base , for before she uttered a word , she had four strikes against her : she was a woman , a Socialist , a foreigner by birth , an empire-hater by conviction . " Enemies of peace , " she cried , " are not all in Germany or Russia . They are right here . They are those who refuse to relinquish vested interests . . . . That word empire is connected with a history of horror and slaughter . I hope to see it disappear from our vocabulary . " <P> Mrs. Steeves 's words were greeted with howls of " Shame ! Shame ! " Up rose B. C. 's Premier Thomas D. Pattullo to chide her-and incidentally to prove that antitotalitarian nations must adopt semi-totalitarian methods to achieve their ends : " I am sorry at the honorable lady member 's attitude , and appeal that no other member of this House give similar utterances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where tolerance is enjoyed . I doubt if she would be allowed such latitude in her native Holland . If such words are again uttered , I shall have to advise Ottawa for action under the Canada War Measures Act .
