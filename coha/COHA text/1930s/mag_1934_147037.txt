Thomas Jenkins &; friend dipped a plane in salute , caught a wing in some telephone wires , crashed fatally . <P> Such were last week 's aviation casualties . Because the danger of flight is not willingly publicized by aviation companies , few laymen can get exact information about the risks involved . Last week the risks were discussed in an article entitled " Flying Is Still Dangerous " in The American Mercury by Kenneth Brown Collings , Wartime Navy flyer , onetime mail pilot , flight instructor and airport manager , author of Flight Hazard . Some of Author Collings ' statements : Average age of airline pilots is 32 . Average men of 32 engaged in normal ground occupations die at the rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilots die at the rate of 25 per 1,000 . But-the average pilot flies only about 800 hr. per year . Hence : <P> A given hour spent as a passenger-carrying pilot in scheduled air-transport operation is about 88 times more likely to result fatally than the same hour spent on the ground . Pilots who carry mail &; express but no passengers run a risk about 95 times normal ; Army &; Navy pilots , 170 times normal ; Marine pilots , 480 times normal . <P> On scheduled U. S. air transport lines the extra hazard per hour of passenger flight is approximately 66 times that of normal ground occupations . Scheduled air transport in Germany , Italy and the Netherlands approaches that of the U. S. in safety . In Great Britain it is " possibly twice as hazardous " ; in France and Mexico , at least five times as hazardous . <P> Chief source of Author Collings ' data : The Actuarial Society of America , which has spent several years studying U. S. War , Navy and Commerce Department records .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
