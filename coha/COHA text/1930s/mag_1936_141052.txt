At Philadelphia 's Franklin Institute one afternoon last week twelve men received from President Nathan Hayward the Institute 's annual awards for achievements in science . Among the distinguished dozen were two Detroiters , one of them , Charles Franklin Kettering , already famed as General Motors ' research vice president ; the other so little known even in his home city that , when Detroit newspapers got word of the Franklin awards , they could find no mention of him in their morgues . This was Albert Leroy Marsh , president of Detroit 's Hoskins Manufacturing Co. , who won the John Price Wetherill Medal " for discoveries or inventions in the physical sciences or for new and important combinations of principles or methods already known , " as a result of work which had set him on the road to fortune , if not fame , 31 years ago . Mr. Marsh 's profitable discovery was made in 1905 . He fused a new alloy called Chromel-20% chromium , 80% nickel- which is still the only alloy or metal ( except costly platinum ) capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alloy or its variants are now made the wire elements which glow in electric stoves , heaters , curling irons , percolators , toasters , sterilizers , waffle irons , cigaret lighters , bed pads . Such an alloy is also used in 85% of all U. S. spark plugs . Metalman Marsh was the first man to make it , first to produce it commercially , first to put it on the market . More than half the alloy wire in U. S. heating elements is still made in his tidy Detroit plant .
