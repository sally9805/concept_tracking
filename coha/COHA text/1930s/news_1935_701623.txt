txt Faced with the alternatives of repudiating either its Foreign Secretary , Sir Samuel Hoare , or its pre-election pledges concerning the League of Nations and the Ethiopian War , the British Government has evidently chosen the latter course as the simpler way out of the worst international snarl any Cabinet has been entangled in for a long time . A decision to go ahead with the Hoare-Laval peace proposals with slight modifications was made this afternoon by the Cabinet and those proposals were sent simultaneously to Rome and Addis Ababa tonight . Anthony Eden , Minister for League Affairs , will take them to Geneva tomorrow for presentation to the League . The bare fact that the terms by which the Ethiopian Emperor will lose half his kingdom if he submits to them are being sent to him as soon as they go to Premier Benito Mussolini is one of the modifications in the original plan . The other change is that Premier Pierre Laval of France has consented that discussion of oil sanctions may continue if necessary while the " peace terms " are being considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amelioration of Terms . These two trivial changes of procedure are the sum total of the diplomatic victory that the British Government was able to achieve today after much frantic telephone negotiation between London and Paris . There is no amelioration of the terms themselves and of the new sovereignty that the British and French Governments are willing to let Mussolini receivo . Mr. Laval had previously insisted that Premier Mussolini be informed first of the proposals and assured at the same time that oil sanctions were automatically eliminated . When the British Government realized last night what the effect was going to be in this country on both the public and Parliament , when there Was a protest within the Cabinet itself led by Mr. Eden and backed - by Neville Chamberlain , Chancellor of the Exchequer , it was determined to do something to soften the blow . Hence today 's emergency meeting of the Cabinet and its decision to ask Mr. Laval to consent to modifications . That Mr. Eden himself weakened or at least decided to withhold his wrath for the time being was evident from the speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consent to go to Geneva tomorrow as bearer of the proposals that he condemns . ? Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin told the Commons that his " lips are not yet unsealed " because the international negotiations were still going on . but he added that if he were at liberty to speak he could make a case that would convince the House that the government had nothing to be ashamed of . Government Pledge Repeated . Both Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Eden reiterated the pledge that the Brit ish would insist on a settlement acceptable to the League , Italy and Ethiopia and both recalled that it had been at the request of the League that this government had , undertaken with France to devise the terms of a settlement . What the League will do with the proposals remains to be seen . " We were commissioned to undertake this work with the French , ' " said Mr. Baldwin in the Commons in reply to the Opposition . " Mr. Eden will make his report to the League when he goes there . He is not going  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of settlement on the League if the League does n't want it . He ca n't enforce it on Italy ; he ca n't enforce it on Ethiopia . " We do not know what any of these parties are going to decide . If nothing results we have got to try again later  --  by and by . This dualism is not impossible , I am sure it commends itself to the country . We shall have to consider again the whole question of how far sanctions may go . The other side has spoken as if it was the simplest thing to prevent oil from going into Italy . It is extraordinarily complicated . If you are going to do it you must be sure your prohibition is effective . " Beyond that tonight there is really nothing that I can usefully say . We are going on with exactly the same policy we have been pursuing . ? * * " Mr. Eden is going to Geneva tomorrow and we shall know very shortly what the reactions may be to the course that we have been pursuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his brief remarks , Mr. Baldwin had said he had not read press dispatches from Paris giving the terms of the Laval-Hoare peace proposals , which had caused such indignation in this country , but he added that he understood those reports had been inaccurate . They were . They said Italy was to get all of Tigre Province , except Aksum . She is to get only most of it . The dispatches also said Italy was to get virtually all of South Ethiopia . They should have said that all that territory was to be given to a chartered Italian company . Otherwise the reports were true , despite tonight 's efforts by the government to gloss them over and emphasize that they were not final but merely a basis for negotiation that must be approved by the League of Nations . But beneath all this effort to face the matter out there is bitter chagrin and disappointment on the part of Mr. Baldwin and his Cabinet over what Sir Samuel Hoare as Foreign Secretary has done in their behalf . Sir Samuel 's own great reputation built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last Parliament has perhaps been seriously injured by what is regarded in London as his selling out to Premier Laval and Mussolini . Still worse , the new prestige that Sir Samuel himself had brought to British foreign policy has now undoubtedly been impaired by this move , which has caused consternation in every capital of Europe except Paris and Rome . Washington Reaction Feared . Not only that , but members of Parliament are privately deploring the whole affair because of the effect , they assume , as a matter of course , it will have in Washington . " It will give you people in the United States another excuse for saying that Britain ca n't be depended on , " said a member of the Commons to this correspondent tonight . So far as domestic politics is concerned Sir Samuel 's move is counted as a monumental blunder . All through the recent electoral campaign Mr. Baldwin and all his Cabinet went around the country declaring that they based their policy on the League and would support it in bringing any aggressor to book . They won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ votes of a large majority of those 12,000,000 persons who had voted for the League in a peace referendum . The charge of the Cabinet 's opponents in that campaign was that as soon as it was returned to power the Baldwin government would ignore its campaign promises and sell out the League . Now they are saying , " We told you so . " Hoare 's Illness Cited . Some of Sir Samuel 's own associates are apologizing for him on the ground that he was a sick man worn out by overwork when he went to Paris last Saturday . He was in a hurry to finish his negotiations with Mr. Laval and get on to Switzerland for the rest and holiday ordered by his doctor , they say . So under these conditions he was no match for Paris diplomacy , to which many another British statesman even In the best of health has completely succumbed since the war . There is an analogy cited in the case of Sir Austen Chamberlain , who as Foreign Secretary in 1928 went to Paris and made a naval agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had to be abandoned . Sir Austen was then ill from overwork and Mr. Baldwin was then Prime Minister . The explanations of Mr. Baldwin 's part in the manoeuvring of the last few days are not so definite as those concerning Sir Samuel . One is that he was not fully informed by his Foreign Secretary of what was happening in Paris and did not grasp the full significance of it until too late . Another speculation is that the government has information concerning Italy 's hostile intentions of which the public is unaware , and that he is so opposed to war that he is willing to avert it even at the cost of jeopardizing the League 's future and entirely regardless of the rights of Ethiopia . Attlee Asks Statement . The matter first came up in the Commons at the afternoon session on a private notice question by Clement R. Attlee , leader of the Labor Opposition , who asked Mr. Baldwin for a statement . The Prime Minister said that any pronouncement by the government while the negotiations were in progress would be inopportune , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Christmas recess . That did not satisfy either the Liberals or the Laborites , who returned to the attack after dinner when H. B. Lees-Smith , member of the last Labor government , voiced the misgivings not only of the two Opposition parties but also of the many Conservatives on the government side of the House . Mr. Lees-Smith said it was the duty of the Opposition before an irretrievable step was taken to give the government an opportunity of either , repudiating any idea that such proposals existed or of correcting them before it was too late . " The simple principle we ought to support , " he said , " is that no aggressor ought in any way or to any degree profit by his aggression . Finally , when the League authority is established , as it will be if we maintain our position on this critical issue , then an aggressor will be expected to pay a reasonable compensation for the material damage caused . " We do not go so far as that at present , but we say it is the duty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that Mussolini shall in no way profit because- he has chosen war instead of choosing to put his claim to the arbitral decision of the Council of the League . " If 50 per , cent of the terms of the proposed settlement published this morning in The Times are correct it is impossible for this country to make itself responsible for them without utterly discrediting itself in the eyes of the world . Sees Italy 's Aims Surpassed . " By the first of these proposals Italy , who has herself asserted that she will not lay claim to anything but the non-Amharic portions of Ethiopia , would receive possession of Tigre , one of the purest Amharic blocs in the whole country . If we accept we are not only going further than the League but further than the principle Mussolini himself laid down . " Then Ethiopia is to receive Assab with a corridor through Eritrea . That ' corridor would always be at the mercy of Italy . It is not a concession ; all it means is that Ethiopia lays her neck on the Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 8 degrees north and 36 degrees west ; that is to say , Italy is to receive territory which , after she has started a war , she has not herself been able to conquer ; territory which it is by no means certain she will ever be able to win on her own account . " The dilemma of the government is obviously that they wish , to support the League and at the same time do not wish to endanger Mussolini and the Italian regime . Admittedly this is the policy of the French Government and if the British laovernment came to an agreement like this they would be , as in many years gone by , following the policy of France and not their own policy . It is an example of the dualism and indecision which have been the curse of British foreign policy in the last four years . It might well be that if Mussolini received a very serious diplomatic defeat his whole situation might be endangered . " I ca n't see how anything like these terms could be accepted by the Negus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms could not be accepted by many countries in the League . France and Britain might by arrangement carry many countries with them in support , but countries able to take an independent view would condemn these proposals as a betrayal of the League and a betrayal of the principles on which the government asked for the vote of the people of this country . " Mr. Eden , replying , began by emphasizing that the League coordinating committee had specifically approved Anglo-French attempts to find a basis of settlement . He added that in Thursday 's debate Sir Samuel Hoare had said that any proposal that might emerge from these discussions must be acceptable to the League , Italy and Ethiopia . " That declaration of policy remains the policy of the British Government at the present time , " said Mr. Eden . " The procedure in connection with these proposals has yet to be completed between us and the French Government . I hope that it may be agreed on tonight . " The British and French Governments have undertaken the unenviable responsibility and have been engaged on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conciliation which will enable the parties to talk . We have no mandate from the League because the committee has no power to give one , but it did express its good wishes for our work . The fact that ' these conversations have been proceeding is a surprise to no one . We never had any illusions about the difficulty of the task . " In any event , this is only the first step in a long and complicated enterprise . If it should happen that the Paris basis for negotiations should commend itself to the principals in this dispute , then a beginning , but only a beginning , will have been made in the task that lies before us . Only " Suggestions , " He Says . " The proposals which have been agreed to in Paris do not necessarily represent the viewpoint of the French Government or the viewpoint of the British Government , but do represent suggestions which , in the judgment of those who took part in the conversations , may enable the parties to get together , and that is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that either party must accept them . We are not seeking to impose terms on anybody ; we have n't the authority to do so . We are forced to find out by communications with the parties whether we ca n't find a basis upon which peace negotiations should be possible , and we make no apologies for that . " Let 's face the facts . If Italy , Abyssinia and the League accept discussion on the basis of the suggestions which have been made in Paris , there is nobody here that is going to say no , ' even if some of those proposals may not be particularly appealing to us . " Mr. Eden outlined thearis plan as follows : " There are three general principles involved in the proposals . They are , first , an exchange of territory to the reciprocal advantage of each party ; second , League assistance for reforms in Abyssinia , and , third , special facilities for an Italian share in Abyssinia 's economic development . " Asserts Plan Is Detailed . Referring to the Committee of Five , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but had not gone into details as to what this exchange should be . , " On this occasion in order to be constructive in Paris at the stage of the dispute now reached , " he continued , " it was necessary to be More precise and in so doing therefore the proposals in Paris do contain , as the Committee of Five proposals do not , an exchange of territory in detail . " This will explain the difficulty in which I am placed tonight . I ' can only ask that the House appreciate both my position and my responsibility . " I go to Geneva tomorrow to represent the British Government , and I go there because the policy of the British Government remains based upon its membership in the League of Nations . I shall hear when I reach Geneva the views of my colleagues from many countries . I shall discuss with them the aspects of this complicated situation . I shall seek then to determine the best course to pursue to further the two objectives we have had constantly before us throughout these anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authority of the League . " I would beg the House not to seek to pledge me beforehand to particular forms of procedure in the work I have to do . I ask for latitude and confidence in the task in which nobody can envy me and in the discharge of which , I trust , all parties will seek to bring me aid . " Mr. Baldwin , who closed the debate for the government , said : " I have seldom spoken with greater regret , for my lips are not yet unsealed , and were these troubles over I would make a case and I would guarantee that no man would go into the lobby against us . " The Opposition has informed me as to the feelings of my own supporters . I generally have a tolerable knowledge of what are their feelings , but I quite agree that on occasions like this there are always anxieties where proposals are made of which the details are not known and can not be disclosed . I have great sympathy with all those anxieties . Some people speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of celestial institution with a volition of its own , as if it was always right , whereas it is a very human body of fallible nations gathered in council and represented by fallible statesmen trying to do what they can to build up the League , which in time may perform all those services for humanity we dreamed of when the League was first founded . " I do n't propose tonight to say anything about its constitution or deficiencies in the absence of certain great nations , but I do want the House to remember this : That as much as it may criticize the government and as much as it may say the League ought to do this and that , we , after all , can not control the League of Nations . We have an influence there . We use it and we ehall continue to use it : but , after all , there are fifty nations in that League . " I would put it to the Opposition that it is not an easy matter to get a decision or get a continuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this history comes to be written every one will consider it remarkable how far the League has traveled and how much it has done . " If the Opposition will look at any observations I have made on the League of Nations in public or anything I have written  --  I was going to say for years past  --  I do n't think there is a word I retract . I have never taken the view that if the League should fail we should despair . " What I want to say to the House is this , and this really sums up the whole  --  we are going on as we have gone on in conjunction with the other members of  --  the League as far as those members will go , as far as we can go together . Unilateral action we do not propose to take , no more than we have ever proposed to take it . " Our power is not absolute . I grant that our prestige is great . The members of the Opposition have said it may be impaired by what has taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Prestige rises and falls . I think in time people will recognize that in the circumstances we may perhaps in detail have gone further than some members would have gone , but our policy is unchanged . "
