Last week Professor Paul John Hanzlik , a San Francisco pharmacologist who has long tried to dissolve bismuth in some fluid which syphilitics may swallow , announced success . His success implied a more comfortable method of treating the estimated 508,000 new cases of this venereal disease which develop in the U. S. each year . <P> Bismuth and mercury , both heavy metals , and arsenic , a light metallike element , have destructive effects upon the twirling spirochete which causes syphilis . In the usual modern treatment some compound of arsenic , such as Neosalvarsan , is used as the main weapon , some form of mercury or bismuth as supplement . The arsenic compound is usually injected into a vein in the arm . Mercury or bismuth compounds are injected into the rump . <P> Many syphilologists give their patients bichloride of mercury to drink , carefully watching that the poison does not destroy the stomach , intestines or kidneys . Such syphilologists believe that potable mercury destroys spirochetes more effectively than mercury injections . Reasoning by analogy , they ask pharmacologists to produce a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his potion , which 200 San Franciscans have found harmless , which 40 San Francisco syphilitics have found beneficial , the solution is sodium bismuthate ; the solvent , a mixture of propylene glycol and a new substance called tri-iso-propanolamine.
