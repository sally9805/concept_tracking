Our Daily Bread ( Viking ) . For the average Hollywood producer , Depression furnished a number of tedious gags , a few new turns for old plots . But it failed to invest the cinema with much New Deal sentiment , much sense of economic ferment . This fact has long rankled in the impatient mind of thick-lipped , shock-haired King Vidor . <P> More than two years ago Director Vidor read an article on subsistence farming by Professor Malcolm McDermott of Duke University . What he felt about subsistence farming seemed too radical for the producers to whom Vidor offered his ideas . Besides , they believed the subject would be outdated before it reached the public . But Vidor 's friends told him to go ahead and for a year Vidor hired a girl to do nothing but clip newspapers . Convinced that the common people were as interested in his theme as he was , he produced Our Daily Bread . Of it he says : " Not only is my heart in the picture , but my shirt as well . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles streets , chose a dirt farm for his location where for two months he drew blue prints of each day 's shooting . Result is a well-paced , high-pitched picture which , though it strikes no alarming political note , should help King Vidor keep his shirt . <P> To a dilapidated mortgaged farm lent them by an uncle go unemployed John Sims ( Tom Keene ) and his wife Mary ( Karen Morley ) . Living on sardines and hacking forlornly at the soil with a spade , they are happy to take in a passerby and his family who have been dispossessed . John puts up signs inviting other jobless to join their community-a carpenter , a stone mason , a barber , a violinist , a tailor , an undertaker , an escaped convict . They build shacks , plough the fields using manpower , a motorcycle , decrepit automobiles . When they first behold a seedling they exhibit nave joy and the carpenter leads them in prayer . But before their crops are ready for harvest their larder is depleted . The convict saves the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $500 reward for his apprehension . Then comes Drought . Gloomily John is about to go off with a wench who has joined the group , when he hears a sound which he knows means the mountain stream is filling . <P> Well cast and well photographed , Our Daily Bread is emotional rather than factual , directed by Vidor with a frequent eye to such devices as a shot of Mary knitting to show goodness , a shot of the wench playing a blues tune to show badness . Best sequence is the final one , done in the Russian manner . In it the community works furiously against time to dig an irrigation ditch from the river to their fields . Of this Director Vidor says : " I tried to develop it like a ballet . I aimed to get the effect of mounting drama through the movements of the diggers ' bodies . With the use of a metronome whose tempo was kept constantly on the increase , I set my actors to work with their picks and shovels . I believe I have gotten what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
