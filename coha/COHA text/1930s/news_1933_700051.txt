txt The stark materialism of modern philosophy is bad enough , but when tin pan alley sets these materialistic ideas to " blue " music to be broad . cast by crooners and torch singers , It 's no wonder that more and more folks are killing themselves . This was the substance of the theme presented yesterday by Rabbi Morris M. Feuerlicht In his address before the fellowship of faiths in convention at the Morrison hotel . ' We hear jazz singers echoing the philosophy that ' Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries said the rabbi in illustrating his point . " That bit of materialism means there is no God and a man might just as well gorge himself with the cherries and die when they are all gone . " " A philosophy of futility is gripping modern thought , " the rabbi continued , " and the result is that the fundamental sanctity of life has been cheapened so that thousands are beginning to believe it is better to die than live .
