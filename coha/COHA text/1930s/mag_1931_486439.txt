GREAT calamities generally breed great leaders . Luckily for this country , the calamity of unemployment proves no exception to the rule . For , at the precise moment when America is faced by this appalling problem , it is Mr. Owen D. Young , chairman of the board of directors of the General Electric Company , and Mr. Walter S. Gifford , president of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company , who come forward with a grand constructive principle , which , if followed , would not only relieve distress , but go far toward lifting us out of the slump . Some of us have been a little skeptical about business leadership . Inclined to undervalue its spirit of service , we have indulged in loose talk about soulless corporations and shortsighted captains of industry . Now the moment has come to revise our views . In offering to the American people a yardstick with which to determine precisely what each one of us should give for the relief of the unemployed , Mr. Young and Mr. Gifford have performed a service of the very highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving , is embodied in a series of appeals , signed by Messrs . Young and Gifford , which were published during October and November as full-page advertisements in our leading magazines . Because they are of transcendent importance , and , what is more , since they are the subject of this article , I venture to quote two of them in full . FORWARD ! Between October 19 and November 25 America will feel the thrill of a great spiritual experience . In those few weeks millions of dollars will be raised in cities and towns throughout the land , and the fear of cold and hunger will be banished from the hearts of thousands . Be sure that you do your part . Give to the funds that will be raised in your community . Give liberally . And know that your gift will bless yourself . It will lift your own spirit . More than anything else you can do , it will help to end the depression and lay the firm foundation for better times . The President 's Organization on Unemployment Relief WALTER S. GIFFORD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You-No , Chairman Trust her to understand . Trust her to appreciate the generous spirit  --  the good-fellowship and manly sympathy which prompted you to help give unhappy people the courage to face the coming winter with their heads held high with faith and hope . It is true  --  the world respects the man who lives within his income . But the world adores the man who gives BEYOND his income . No  --  when you tell her that you have given somewhat more than you had planned , you will see no censure in her eyes . But love ! Italics as in original . The President 's Organization on Unemployment Relief WALTER S. GIFFORD , Director Committee on Mobilization of Relief Resources OWEN D. YOUNG , Chairman Here is a picture of what constitutes proper giving which leaves nothing to be desired . Mr. Young and Mr. Gifford have made their definition as clear as sunlight . Giving " beyond your income " obviously means giving until you have cut into your capital ; and if you have no capital , then giving at a rate that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so grave is the unemployment crisis , that Mr. Young and Mr. Gifford advise us not only to give till " the world adores " us for our noble , if reckless , folly ; but to go on giving until we have reached the highest peak of sacrifice , where we will find our reward in " the thrill of a great spiritual experience . " This is the true test of right giving . On this rock Mr. Young and Mr. Gifford found that new religion of brotherhood which is at the heart of the drive . A spiritual thrill , however , is not to be the sole reward of right giving under the Young-Gifford plan . For in another manifesto which came out in the middle of November Mr. Young and Mr. Gifford , in a playful mood , apostrophize the people of the United States as " Mr. and Mrs. John K. American , " and advise them that , if they will but give with the same spirit of sacrifice with which they fought in France and went without sugar in the World War , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the Germans , " and lead the way to better days . " A careful analysis of the Young-Gifford plan shows the following outstanding features . First , the plan is universal . That is to say , it applies with equal force to all classes of society , high and low . For it would be an insult to attribute to Mr. Young and Mr. Gifford , and especially to Mr. Hoover , who appointed these gentlemen , an intention to set up one standard for the rich and another for the poor . Nor could any person of average sensibility , or indeed self-respect , ask a poor man to make a sacrifice which he himself was unwilling to shoulder . Each donation is judged , not at all by its size , but by the amount of sacrifice . A gift by a poor clerk hardly able to keep his family in shoes is , therefore , greater by far than even one of millions by the possessor of a large fortune . And this sound principle President Hoover has heartily indorsed by pledging a day 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to his unostentatious contributions in California and Washington . Second , it places no obligation to give on poor people , because most of them have already sacrificed up to or beyond the , prescribed point . I am not familiar with conditions outside New York , but in this city you can find no man or woman who works among the poor who will not tell you that at least four-fifths of the load of helping the unemployed poor has been carried by the employed poor . One of the most impressive things about the depression is the way the poor who earn wages are sharing with their less fortunate neighbors . This , I am told , is not because they are generous or heroic , but for the simple reason that the common run of humanity has n't the nervous resistance to watch people going under from idleness , hunger , and despair without doing something about it . Plainly , Mr. Gifford , Mr. Young , and Mr : Hoover intended that the poor should be excluded from the drive , since asking them to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it is a very stupid proposal , because every dollar taken from them in that way reduces by just that much what they can give and are giving directly to jobless people with whom they are in daily touch . Unfortunately , ex-Governor Alfred E. Smith , director general of the drive in New York , and ex-Supreme Court Justice Morgan J. O'Brien , one of his distinguished lieutenants , failed to post themselves on these matters , as shown by the fact that they have repeatedly advised their 17,000 canvassers to get subscriptions from every last man and woman who has employment , and , if possible , to pledge them for twenty weeks of giving . On November 18 , according to the Times , Judge O'Brien , in a speech to canvassers , deplored the sad fact that only 200,000 out of over 2,000,000 wage-earners in New York had as yet been accorded an opportunity of sharing . But the bright and particular beauty of the HooverYoung-Gifford plan of correct giving is that , if it were applied , as was no doubt the hope of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called " ' high-bracket " group , an immense relief fund could be raised without hurting anybody , and without forcing a single individual to climb more than halfway up the hill of sacrifice to which the plan points . it is true that , through some error on the part of the management , this feature of the plan was lost in the shuffle . But we can not doubt that it was in the minds of Mr. Young , Mr. Gifford , and Mr. Hoover when , in the sessions of sweet silent thought , they were pondering their program at the White House . In 1931 , 149 income-tax returns were made in this country on incomes of over a million dollars a year , as follows : 149 $355,661,694 Here we have three and a half hundred millions  --  a considerable pan of cream from which to drain off something for the poor . In addition , 19,539 people made returns on incomes of from $50,000 to $1,000,000 a year , which incomes total $2,112,721,137 . Adding these together , we have almost two and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken without undue hardship to the owners . To tap this reservoir of wealth would require no armies of canvassers . Mr. Hoover , Mr. Young , and Mr. Gifford , beginning with themselves naturally , and aided only by their two committees and a few actuaries , could do it within a fortnight if they wanted . Again , as an argument for centering the drive on the high brackets , before chasing after clerks , mill hands , shop girls , and waitresses in chain restaurants , the keen minds of Hoover , Young , and Gifford must instantly have grasped the fact that it is an economic stupidity to ask money from poor people if you can get it anywhere else . What business needs most in this depression is more buying , more demand for goods , so that our farms , factories , and stores may get on their feet . Practically every cent that is taken from wage-earners for the relief fund would be used for buying if it were left in their hands . Money donated by the rich , however , especially the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a different position . Only a little of it can be used for buying goods , since its owners can consume but a limited amount . Nor is it needed as capital for new enterprise . Capital is a drug on the market now . Con sequently , the part used for unemployment relief would otherwise not be used at all until the depression subsides and its owners invest it . At which time the unemployment crisis will presumably be on the mend . Until about the middle of October , when the drive was launched , everything went well . Relying on the President 's promise that not one of them should suffer , the unemployed were anticipating winter with nothing short of delight . in fact , they were looking forward to it as the one winter in which they would all be comfortable . But apparently about this time , while Mr. Young and Mr. Gifford were down in Washington conferring with Mr. Hoover on the means of putting their plan in practice , some selfish , class-conscious persons , who wanted the wage-earners to get all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along and started the drive hind end foremost , thus in effect wresting the opportunity of sacrifice from the rich and handing it over to the poor , who really did n't need it . Mistaken as were these betrayers of the great principle of right giving , it must be conceded that they showed a certain degree of leadership . In fact , the speed with which they organized their drive to bring the opportunity of giving to the wage-earners of 690 cities showed a leadership worthy of Napoleon . Never in , the history of this Republic , not even in the closing months of Presidential years , have the poor enjoyed so much attention . Ex-governors , ex-judges , ex-foreign princesses , ex-police commissioners , even crews of ex-beaux from ex-fashionable clubs have dogged the footsteps of the poor like hounds of heaven , appealing to their greed of glory and urging them to hog all the thrill and honor  --  which also might be described as " ex " now that the drive is over . In the bygone days of prosperity it was bad enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already getting somewhat above themselves . But now , by jingo , if we go on spoiling them at this rate , they 'll be wanting to get asked to dinner . Well , the poor have certainly won out . But unless Congress resorts to the noxious principle of relief by a bond issue and big taxes on the high brackets , which the drive was wisely devised ' to prevent , the rich will have another chance to get their thrill in another drive before spring . In New York City $18,000,000 has been or will have been raised by the Hoover drive . Mr. Gibson , chairman of the Emergency Unemployment Relief Committee , says there are 750,000 unemployed people here . The Welfare Council reported 227,000 families without means of support last August . This implies that perhaps a million and a half people are destitute , so that $18,000,000 would provide , on an average , $12 apiece . If the relief period should last 180 days , this would provide $2 per person per month . All of which proves the wisdom of setting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to lower the morale of the jobless by pampering and overfeeding , it should at least suffice , as Mr. Young and Mr. Gifford tell us in a statement already quoted , to fill the unemployed with " faith and hope " during the cold weather . Yet , in a way , the situation remains desperate . Something should be done , and done at once , toward restoring to the rich the opportunity of sharing which the Young-Gifford plan meant them to have . Otherwise , in scaling the peak of sacrifice ? to which the plan dedicates them , they may find themselves forced to resort to the method of the late 1VIark Twain and his friends in their famous ascent of the Matterhorn . On the day fixed for the high adventure the unkind elements seemed bent upon keeping Mark in the valley . The thermometer had fallen ; it was uncomfortable weather for climbing . Suddenly , with characteristic common sense , the Great Mountaineer hit upon a solution . While the rest of the party toiled painfully up the height , Mark got most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by sitting in an arm-chair on the hotel piazza and watching them through a telescope .
