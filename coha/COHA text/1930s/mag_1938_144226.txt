Exhibited at Manhattan 's Museum of Modern Art last week were three types of art from three nations . In one room were examples of U. S. industrial art in machined metal and glass . In another the Museum displayed modern furniture , scientifically designed in pale plywood by the brilliant Finnish architect , Alvar Aalto . Balancing these examples of machine and functional art was a third room in which visitors found reportorial art of the most sensitive kind-an exhibition of 105 drawings made in Spain by the Leftist artist , Luis Quintanilla . <P> A Basque , a nephew of a Bishop of Burgos , Luis Quintanilla was at one time a student at the Jesuit University of Deusto near Bilbao . Before the World War and before he was 20 , he lived with the late Cubist Juan Gris in a leaky studio on the Place des Abbesses . Paris , learned to paint , he says , by " talking about it all the time .

While he was in prison for his Socialism in 1931 , Ernest Hemingway and John Dos Passes got him his first one-man show in the U. S. In July 1936 , he finished his most ambitious mural , eleven panels containing 140 life-size figures , for Madrid 's monument to the founder of Spanish Socialism , Pablo Iglesias . A few nights later Painter Quintanilla made himself a hero of the Republic by directing the attack which took the Montaa barracks in Madrid . <P> While bombs and shell fire were making rubble out of Luis Quintanilla 's murals and his studio near University City , he fought with the Leftist infantry in the Guadarrama Mountains , at Toledo and in Madrid . In the fourth month of the war the Government carefully sent him out of danger on a diplomatic mission to France . Last June it let him return for six months of sketching along the front from Madrid to Teruel . After showing his drawings in Barcelona last December , Artist Quintanilla packed them , frames and all , in six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little studio on Washington Square near the house of his host , Writer Jay Allen , he has lately been doing his first painting in two years . A small , sombre , keen-witted man in casual brown clothes , 43-year-old Artist Quintanilla had it in mind last week to quit painting again , go back to help his friends in Spain . <P> The Quintanilla drawings show war 's effects on the streets of Madrid and Almeria , on the villagers of Andalusia surprised by bombing and strafing airplanes , on Moorish , Italian , German and Spanish prisoners , on wounded men in hospitals . Seeming as delicately bitten as etchings , they were done with a fine quill pen in a uniformly unexcited style . Ruins of masonry , the broken bodies of the dead , the brutalized bodies of the living , all were recorded with the same hard outline and shading , the same careful , slightly grotesque composition . By this apparent monotony and coldness Artist Quintanilla made a profile of Spain 's war with a more cutting edge than the work of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
