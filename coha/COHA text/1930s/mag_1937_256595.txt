Heat is the energy of motion of tiny particles , the vigorous dance of the atoms and molecules that constitute matter . When matter is chilled , the dance becomes torpid . At Absolute Zero ( - 273.13 degrees C. ) it would cease altogether . Scientists have not attained and do not expect to attain absolute Absolute Zero , but by a laborious process which involves repeated magnetization and demagnetization they have chilled certain salts to .0002 of one degree above Absolute Zero ( TIME , Feb . <P> 25 , 1935 ) . <P> An electric current is simply the passage of electrons through a conductor . The greater the number of electrons , the higher the amperage of the current . At normal temperatures the electrons , pushed by the voltage , make the best individual progress they can through the maze of atoms , and they are impeded by the atomic dance . If the conductor is progressively chilled , the resistance to the current should fall off as the atomic dance slows down . In theory , the resistance should diminish in a smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the electrons would encounter no more opposition than would an army marching through the serried ranks of an enemy frozen stockstill . In practice , the resistance does fall in a smooth curve down to one or two degrees above Absolute Zero where it vanishes abruptly although some slight heat is left in the conductor . Then an electric current started in a ring of lead will keep going around the ring indefinitely . This phenomenon is called superconductivity . <P> In its leading article last week , Technology Review ( Massachusetts Institute of Technology ) sets forth a tentative explanation of why superconductivity , the condition of no resistance , occurs before the atomic dance has entirely stopped . At ordinary temperatures the electrons are dispersed and disorganized by the vibration and must make their way alone . But , in the view of Professor John Clarke Slater , head of M. I. T. 's physics department , in the neighborhood of Absolute Zero the atomic interference is so feeble that electrons may combine in large swarms and travel along together like mountain climbers tied together by a rope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show of opposition that might impede one electron impedes the swarm not at all , and electrical resistance is therefore nil .
