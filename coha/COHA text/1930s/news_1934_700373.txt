txt Argue Britain Can Ease Taxes or Raise Salaries if We Can Spend in Face of Deficit . CUT IN INCOME LEVY ASKED But Tory Demand Is Opposed by Workers , Who Want Insurance Benefits Increased , By CHARLES A. SELDEN . Wireless to THE NEW YORK TIMES . LONDON , Jan. ** from their curiosity about the stupendous figures in the United States budget and the prospective public debt , the British people are finding in President Roosevelt 's fiscal message material for argument on both sides of the controversy which is just beginning over their own government 's budget . Great Britain is going to finish the current financial year with a surplus instead of a deficit of ? 32,000,000 as in last year 's account . Chancellor of the- Exchequer Neville Chamberlain already has given a plain intimation that there is going to be a surplus , but how much it will be and how the government intends to use it will not be revealed until he presents his budget to Parliament in April . There are two distinct groups of British politicians , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relief of what is regarded as the country 's most urgent need . Income Tax Cut Sought . One demand is for a reduction in the income tax rate of five shillings in the pound . That campaign is confined chiefly to the Conservative party , which controls the government and Parliament . On the other hand , the Socialists , many Liberals and the powerful Trade Union group are equally insistent that the government take advantage of returning prosperity to restore the , economy cuts which it made two years ago in unemployment insurance benefits and the salaries of teachers , policemen , sailors and soldiers . There is also bound to be a third demand on the Exchequer for an increased appropriation for the fighting services , especially the air force and navy . That comes from a section of the same Tory group that wants the income tax reduced . But that is another story that does not particularly fit into the argument now raised by citing contrasts and analogies between the United States and the United Kingdom . Use Us as Argument . If President Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficits and prospective new loans mentioned in his message without any hint of increasing the low United States income tax , the British Government , with a surplus instead of a deficit and with debt charges greatly decreased , can certainly take something off the 25 per cent income tax . But the workers and Socialists do not see it that way at all . The thing in Mr. Roosevelt 's message which looms largest to them is his promise to restore the one-third economy cuts in the government payroll . If , say the Socialists , Mr. Roosevelt can do that , despite the United States deficit , the British Government , with a surplus , can surely take care of the ? 70,000,000 wage and insurance benefit cuts which it made two years ago with a promise to restore them as soon as the country 's financial crisis was over . Either way it is going to be an awkward situation for the government and filled with political and electoral risks unless perchance Mr. Chamberlain 's surplus is so big that he can do a little something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another feature of Mr. Roosevelt 's message which interests all British is the fact that he does not give even a tentative estimate of what the United States may receive on account of war debts .
