txt Discovering a typographical error in the resolution adopted by the Board of Aldermen on Dec. 2 approving the 1938 city budget , which made it appear that the Aldermen had voted a nine-year instead of a one-year budget , Mayor La Guardia returned the resolution yesterday with his veto . In addition to the textual flaw in the resolution , the Mayor said , he had another reason for considering the budget illegal , which he would produce at the proper time and place . He has been at odds with the Aldermen over their reduction of city water rates by $12,000,000 , which he vetoed because it threw the budget out of balance by that amount . They overrode the Mayor 's veto , despite his contention that they lacked legal power to cut the rates without a prior recommendation by the Commissioner of Water Supply , Gas and Electricity . The Mayor also tried to throw sixty-five county jobs out of the budget , only to find them restored by the Democratic majority in the Board of Estimate . Mayor 's Veto Message His message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : To : The Honorable The Board of Aldermen . Dear Sirs : Re : Int . No. 1570 I am returning herewith a resolution adopting the budgets for the year 1938 and the first six months of 1939 adopted by your honorable board on Dec. 2 , 1937 . Aside from the reason which I consider the present budget unlawful , which reason will be submitted at a later and proper time , I can not approve the resolution adopted by the board , which reads as follows : " That the budget for 1938 and the budget for the period Jan. 1 , 1930 to June 30 , 1939 , be and the same hereby is adopted and approved . " The reasons being obvious , the resolution is returned with my disapproval and veto . F. H. LA GUARDIA , Mayor . By naming the budget period as one running from Jan. 1 , 1930 , to June 30 , 1939 , the Aldermen made a serious error . The budget period , as the Mayor pointed out , runs from Jan. 1 , 1938 , to June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the change in the city 's fiscal year , effective next year . The sixty-five political office holders whose jobs were slashed from the budget in October by the Mayor regained their positions through the efforts of the Democratic majority in the Board of Estimate . For the most part they are Tammany leaders and co-leaders working in such offices as those of Sheriff , Registet , County Clerk , Public Administrator and Commissioner of Records in the five counties making up the city . In eliminating these jobs , the Mayor called attention to a referendum adopted at the polls two years ago , which he interpreted as a mandate upon the city for reorganization of its county offices . The Mayor said his move , if it had stood , would have saved the city $287,420 a year . Mayor La Guardia 's executive budget was $589,222,376.15 . This was increased to $589,980,576.64 by the Tammany members of the Board of Estimate . The Aldermen adopted it without change at a routine meeting . When the Mayor 's veto message was received at the Board of Aldermen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F. Brunner directed that it be received and laid over . Alderman Newbold Morris , President-elect of the City Council , started to say that the city now had no budget , but Vice Chairman Timothy J. Sullivan reminded him that the Aldermen had no authority to discuss the Mayor 's action at that time .
