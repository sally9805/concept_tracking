As a newsmaker , aviation is No. 1 U. S. industry . Whether a planeful of prominent people smacks a mountain or Charles Augustus Lindbergh asks for bids for huge airliners , aviation crashes the front pages . This obscures in investors ' minds the fact that as business the aviation industry is small potatoes . Last week a small , handsomely-printed volume summarized neatly and ably the striking characteristics of this diminutive industry . Its author was William Barclay Harding , who prepared it for the clients of his firm , the Wall Street house of Chas . D. Barney &; Co. * Wall Street houses constantly prepare brochures on U. S. industries but for several years there has been no survey of aviation from a financial point of view of anywhere near such completeness . Its noteworthy facts and opinions on the two great divisions of the industry , manufacture and transport : <P> In 1936 the manufacturing gross of the industry was about $83,000,000-compared to $153,000,000 for office equipment , $328,000,000 for refrigerators . $2,448,925,000 for automobiles &; trucks . <P> Division of the sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , $9,000,000 worth of parts ( radios , propellers , instruments , etc . ) . <P> Expected 1937 sales : $110,000,000 ( best in history ) . Reason : big U. S. purchases of Army &; Navy planes . <P> Can the increase keep up ? Probably through 1938 at least . <P> This does not mean that the securities of any manufacturer of military planes is a good buy , for military plane construction necessitates huge development expenses which may go for nothing if a competitor gets the contract . <P> Airlines grossed $36,700,000 in 1936-compared to $275,000,000 for busses , $4,052,000,000 for Class I railroads . <P> Airline business has more than quadrupled since 1929. but no airline in the U. S. has yet made a substantial profit ( United Air Lines made only $367,000 last year ) . <P> Airmail rates have been drastically low ever since the notorious air mail contract cancelations of 1934 and the abortive Air Mail Act it produced . Airlines are generally considered a heavily subsidized industry , actually are barely so , since sales of stamps almost equal Post Office payments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiscal year 1936-37 ) . <P> Best chance for an investor to share in airline progress : the growth of trans-ocean flying , now almost entirely concentrated , so far as concerns the U. S. , in the hands of Pan American Airways . <P> Pan American is prosperous and will almost certainly be flying the Atlantic next summer on commercial schedule , but the company has been severely criticized as a monopoly ; in 1939 its profitable South American mail contracts expire and are unlikely to be renewed at the present high rate . " Therefore the only present medium of investment in the promising foreign field is the stock of a company which is facing a major crisis in the not far distant future .
