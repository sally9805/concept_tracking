Partisans <P> Sirs : <P> In reading your magazine TIME recently I have grown to feel that your organization or your magazine is Democratic in its political viewpoint . <P> Your sarcastic references to President Hoover and other Republicans ... as well as other articles in TIME , cause me to raise this question . <P> H. M. ROY <P> Minneapolis , Minn . <P> Sirs : <P> In spreading the merits and entertaining quality of TIME , I have been opposed by people who maintain TIME is a Republican magazine . Is this true , or is TIME nonpolitical ? I ca n't help adding to this letter that I think TIME is great ! It is as entertaining as it is newsy . <P> Louis PAUL <P> New York City <P> Sirs : <P> Do you actually favor the candidacy of Herbert Hoover ? If you say that you do , will you explain the inconsistency of your present advocacy and your very evident attitude of four years ago when you secretly opposed his nomination ? . . . . <P> Finally , are you Wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or both like Mr. Hoover ? <P> LOUIS M. JlGGITTS Democratic National Committeeman from Mississippi Jackson , Miss . <P> Sirs : <P> Your animus against the President is becoming more evident and is displeasing to many people . I think that the continuance of the useful place that you have made for yourselves will depend very largely upon your ability to present the news without prejudice or bias . . . . R. H. CLARK <P> Cleveland , Ohio <P> Sirs : Please cancel the subscription of H. Glenn Lewis when it expires . We are disappointed in TIME , in that it is not the non-partisan periodical we had felt the need of , but one using its influence to lead our country into the jeopardy of leadership of a party pledged to the repeal of the 18th Amendment and whose hazardous policies might mean ruin at the present time . . . . MRS . HARRY T. LEWIS <P> Payette , Idaho <P> Sirs : <P> We certainly enjoy your clear and fool-proof accounts of the progress of the national election each week . I note that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do they want you to do ? Publish a garbled account of the trend of the times , and soft-pedal the fact that the country is on a great Democratic tidal wave ? If you did that very thing you would destroy the very thing that makes TIME the one magazine that so many of us depend on for a real account of what has happened . A very common remark these days is , Let 's wait and see what TIME has to say about it .. . . JAMES HIGGENBOTTOM <P> Fredricksburg , Va . <P> Sirs : <P> ... In working one 's way through college , the student has not much time for daily news items and must cast his lot with one periodical . I have chosen TIME . <P> It seems to be more important to be informed of all the truth than merely the presentation of " the highest type of statesmanship . ' ' <P> In speaking of a Louisiana swamp , one might as well say " do n't talk about mosquitoes , think of all the beautiful birds . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watson <P> Sirs : <P> We , constituents of Senator James E. Watson of Indiana , would like you to publish a sketch of the career and achievements of the Honorable Jim . W. A.
