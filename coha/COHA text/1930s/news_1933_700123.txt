Officers Believed Slain . Firing was heard a short time later at Cabanas fortress and is believed by many fo have signified the quick execution of the officers taken there . Word of the killings of the soldiers and officers quickly spread throughout the city and suburbs and the soldiers began to retaliate by terrorizing the public , who rushed pell-mell in all directions , seeking cover from the withering fire going on up and down all the downtown and residential streets .

The city was being patroled tonight by soldiers and police armed with rifles . The cafes , which hurriedly closed their doors when the general shooting broke out , were ordered by the soldiers to open their doors . This order is said to have been issued owing . to the failure of a half-drunken officer of the new enlisted men 's army to obtain a drink at the Cafe Central . The newly promoted officers and men were reported to. , be drinking heavily tonight and it is feared this may bring further trouble .

Also it is known the army labored. incessantly yesterday transporting a large supply of ammunition , extra machine ' ? guns and other armaments to the vicinity of the hotel . Just after midnight large detachments of troops motored to the scene and were assigned to posts . Cavalry men likewise were liberally sprinkled throughout the battle zone . Rumors that Colonel Batista had seized control of the government circulated this morning but were proved untrue when President Grau appeared at the palace late this afternoon with several members of the Student Directorate who said " all of our problems are now solved with the surrender of the officers . " However , , a few minutes later firing broke out in all parts of the city . Many visitors were forced to remain in the palace as for almost an hour soldiers posted there and civilian snipers on the roofs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At 9 o'clock the firing died down but was expected to recommence soon . Colonel Batista communicated to Ambassador Welles unofficially for his inforamtion the terms on which the officers surrendered . They were that the officers must come out unarmed in groups of five every ten minutes , that they be taken into custody , that their lives be guaranteed and that their persons would be treated with respect . 75s were moved into a vacant lot and unlimbered for action . The ? sbutheast cerner-bf the hotel soon showed the telling effect of the artillery fire . Large gaping holes appeared in the walls . Entire rooms were ' blown out by direct hits . Thirty-seven millimeter guns on the roof pf Havana University also scored many hits , ? while other small artillery kept up an incessant fire - which drove the officers from the east wing of the ' building . The damage to the hotel , owned by the Plaza Hotel Corporation of New York , was tremendous . Youths Active in Fighting . This correspondent visited Havana University , where the student militia known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some 150 youths were crouched behind a stone parapet on the roof . A section of the parapet had been cut away to make room for a small artillery piece manned by ' an experienced crew which kept up a continuous fire on the hotel . Also automobiles filled with these youths , armed to the teeth , circulated throughout the city in anticipation of a movement on the part of sympathizers with the officers . Although stores opened this morning as usual , they soon began to close owing to lack of customers as well as employes , many of whom failed to come downtown . At noon the banks and Stock Exchange closed and business houses soon followed suit . Americans living in the danger zone near the hotel frantically appealed to United States diplomatic representatives , demanding evacuation . One resident of the Lopez Serrano Building told this correspondent over the telephone his entire family was lying flat on the floor to escape bullets crashing through windows into the ceilings as soldiers below raked the building with rifle and machine-gun fire in the belief snipers were posted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Welles and Consul General F. F. Dumont to remove Americans from the battle zone . During the truce Red Cross workers entered the hotel to take away wounded officers , seventeen being removed . The truce lasted until 3 P. M. , when the firing again commenced and continued for some time after a white flag was run up at the hotel .

In a fight which lasted half an hour Senor Lopez , owner of a radio station on the roof , sustained a shattered leg . A policeman was shot through one ear and a soldier and civilian were wounded . Many Americans live in this hotel , but none was injured . Wives Appeal to Welles .

The delegation was not received at the chancellery , . but the Ambassador was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attend a meeting of the diplomatic corps , which unanimously designated the ' Spanish Ambassador , Senor Luciano Ferrer , to petition President Grau San Martin for a peaceful solution of the officer question . As most of the Cuban newspapers are closed by strikes , correspondents of American newspapers were besieged today with telephone calls from both Cubans and Americans demanding to know when United States marines ' would be landed . Much bitter criticism of the student directorate , the group of about thirty students who control the government , was heard today among the general public . From a feeling of sympathy with these youths , who tenaciously fought against General Machado , there has developed intense indignation as a result of today 's incidents , for which the students are blamed . The opposition against the government has been growing steadily among all classes . Racial clashes are expected in Trinidad , Santa Clara Province , where a band of forty to fifty Negroes in that district threaten to attack the whites , according to information from there today . It is understood that government troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Starts at 6 A. M. At 6 A. M. a shot was fired and two rockets set off as a signal for starting the battle . Immediately the rat-a-tat of machine guns and rapid-firers reached a tremendous crescendo , which could be clearly heard throughout the city . The people of Havana who had ? been expecting- such a move from the army for the past ? twenty days , rushed to vantage ? oints , some going to housetops and others as near the immediate scene of action as possible . In a radius of three or four blocks from the hotel bullets could be heard whizzing and singing in the air . At the same time civilians on roofs near the hotel sent a rain of bullets down on the soldiers , which caused a diversion of troops to clean out snipers , evidently sympathizers with or relatives of the entrapped officers . Some twenty-five civilians were wounded and thousands of lives endangered as the soldiers raked the housetops and windows Of all large buildings looking down on the National Hotel for several blocks . The firing continued steadily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point in the hotel , perched on a high cliff at the spat where the old Santa Clara battery stood in Spanish days , took a heavy toll from among the soldiers , who sought shelter in the huge Carreno building ? directly opposite the hotel , or back of lamp posts , marble posts and seats in Maine Park and on roofs and balconies of houses near the National Hotel . - Officers Repulse Attack . The first attempt by the soldiers , aided by two armored trucks , to rush the main entrance of the hotel , was ? repulsed by the officers , eight soldiers being killed . No further attempts were made to do this . It was learned also that the soldiers refused thereafter to man the trucks , as the bullets had perforatei the sheet armor , wounding several . At about 10:30 , machine gun and rifle fire apparently proving ineffective , Colonel Batista , who was personally directing operations , ordered artillery rushed to the scene .
