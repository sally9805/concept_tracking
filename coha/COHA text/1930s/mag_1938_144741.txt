A banker has been defined as a man who offers you an umbrella , then wants it back when it starts to rain . There has been plenty of rain this year in U. S. economic life and bank vaults are stuffed with umbrellas-$2,500,000,000 in excess reserves . Last week this familiar situation was attacked from a new angle by Chairman Marriner Stoddard Eccles of the Federal Reserve System . Mr. Eccles is a smalltown banker from Utah and so ardent a believer in New Deal theories of credit control that he has often been a White House spokesman on them . He wrote last week in reply to a letter from Senator Vandenberg : <P> " One reason why bank credit is not flowing adequately into productive business channels is because the banks are under too severe restrictions in their lending and investing operations . This is due both to Federal and State bank-examination policies and to the regulation of the Comptroller of the Currency governing investments by member banks . As to loans , many would-be borrowers can not get deserved accommodation by the banks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the restrictions imposed upon them . ' ' <P> These remarks brought to light a behind-the-scenes fight between Mr. Eccles and the Treasury . The Federal Reserve Chairman would relax restrictions on bank investments and use bank regulations and examinations as the Federal Reserve uses its reserve requirements : loosen them in depressions , tighten them in booms . Stoutly opposed to this are Acting Comptroller of the Currency Marshall Diggs , and former Comptroller J. F. T. O'Connor who resigned three months ago to run for Governor of California . Both Mr. O'Connor and Mr. Diggs prefer to consider investment and loan restrictions , as well as bank examinations , not instruments of monetary control but of protection for investors . <P> Mr. Diggs and Mr. Eccles are now on a committee with Chairman Leo Crowley of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . and Economic Adviser Cyril Upham of the Treasury for the specific purpose of rearranging and simplifying bank examinations and investment policies . Arrayed with Mr. Diggs are Messrs . Crowley and Upham . Mr. Eccles is a distinct minority . When the committee sends its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report too . Mr. Roosevelt will then have to decide between stiff bank control and easy money .
