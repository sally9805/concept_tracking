Last month Manhattan 's Tammany Hall was down in the dumps . Its official mayoralty candidate , Royal Samuel Copeland , the personal &; private selection of Tammany Chieftain James J. Dooling , was by no means acceptable to many an old-line Tammany leader . Worse still , Tammany had been let down by the leaders of New York City 's four other boroughs , who had selected an opposition candidate in the person of Grover Aloysius Whalen , thus diminishing Tammany 's otherwise fair chance of recovering the City Hall held for the last four years by Fusion Mayor LaGuardia ( TIME , Aug. 2 ) . Then Leader Dooling died and Tammany Hall perked up . In hope and harmony , expecting that a new Tammany chief would succeed in finding a compromise candidate to replace the two who threatened to split the Democratic vote , Tammany unanimously elected Representative Christopher D. Sullivan , 21 years a Tammany Congressman , to succeed Leader Dooling . <P> Last week Tammany Hall was down in the dumps again . First off , Christy Sullivan , instead of doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Copeland was still his nominee to ride Tammany 's Tiger . Then Grover Whalen withdrew , not in the interests of unity , but to make way for a stronger opposition candidate . <P> " I confess I am not the best available man , " wrote resigning Mr. Whalen with exemplary modesty . " . . . Judge Mahoney is far better equipped . " That new Candidate Jeremiah Titus Mahoney was better equipped , many a politician was inclined to agree . Onetime athlete ( in 1897 he won New York City 's all-round athletic championship ) , onetime law partner of New York 's politically powerful Senator Robert F. Wagner ( still his close friend ) , onetime State Supreme Court Justice ( he resigned in 1928 to return to private practice ) , honest Jeremiah Mahoney , now 62 , big-framed and firm-jawed , has made few enemies among New York politicians , has the confusing advantage of being himself a potent member of Tammany Hall and leader of its silk-stockinged 15th District . Outside politics , Judge Mahoney is currently best known as president of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year after he had urged that the U. S. send no athletes to the Olympic Games in Berlin ( TIME , Nov. 4 , 1935 et seq . ) . For that stand Mr. Mahoney , if nominated , could count on receiving a large Jewish vote , possibly offsetting a similar vote that fiery little Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia expects to receive for his anti-Hitlerism . And Mr. Mahoney could look for support from no less a personage than Franklin Roosevelt . Although President Roosevelt would probably like to see Administration enemies in Tammany thrown out forever , a formal denial was issued this week that he would take any hand in the mayoralty fight . <P> Meanwhile , impeccably dressed Grover Whalen returned to his comfortable duties as head of New York 's 1939 World 's Fair . Candidate Mahoney declared : " I am no man 's man . " Candidate Copeland sniffed : ' ' These shufflings do not concern me . " Candidate LaGuardia , already Fusion 's and American Labor Party 's choice and still waiting for a friendly nod from the Republicans , said nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
