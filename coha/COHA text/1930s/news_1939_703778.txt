txt In spite of the terrific pressure brought against it by special groups , the full Senate Appropriations Committee has had the courage to stand up to the recommendations of its subcommittee and to the vote of the House to cut the $875,000,000 appropriation asked by the President for five more months of WPA to a total of $725,000 , - 000 . The battle now goes to the Senate floor , where the groups opposed to the $150,000,000 cut may be expected to intensify their campaign against it . Their present argument is the same one that has been raised every time in the last five years that any attempt has been made to examine the relief problem realistically or to see whether a method could be found to keep relief expenditures within manageable limits . They contend that we can not reduce the present ' 2vel of relief expenditures , or the amount recommended by the President , without leaving hundreds of thousands of persons ( they even cite figures in millions ) to " freeze and starve . " Will this cry withstand a calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The WPA appropriation for which the President has asked would amount to an average of $175,000,000 a month . The appropriation which the House passed and which the Senate Appropriations Committee recommends would amount to an average of $145,000,000 a month . In the corresponding five months from February to June inclusive a year ago the amount averaged $158,000,000 a month . In view of the theory that relief must be high in the Winter months but will go down in the Spring , it is interesting to notice that it was precisely last Spring that relief costs began to shoot upward . In the three Winter months last year of January , February and March the average WPA expenditure was only $123,000,000 . But these comparisons fail to tell the full story . In the corresponding five months ( February to June ) last year the average official index of industrial production was 78 and the average official index of factory employment 85 . The latest index of industrial production is 104 and the latest index of factory employment 91 . Presumptively , therefore ( even after making every reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as great today as they were last Winter . But , in addition , we must remember that WPA is now lleing supplemented much more extensively than in the past . Comparisons are difficult here , because there is no single source from which the figures are reported ; but we must add the general relief expenditures of the States and localities , the increased Federal and State payments to the aged , the blind and dependent children , and , above all , the increased sums now available under the State unemployment insurance programs . Last January only twenty-three States were paying benefits under the program ; now nearly all are doing so . About $400,000,000 was paid out last year under this program alone . This change in conditions and these supplemental payments are not emphasized or even mentioned by most of those demanding the higher relief appropriation . But there is another factor , to which Senator Adams has called attention . Those in charge of WPA talk as if the only way they could get along on the reduced appropriation would be by dismissing people from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WPA administrators " are now spending an average of $61 per worker throughout the country . Every time they reduce that by $1 they can take care of 50,000 more people . " It might be added that this would not necessarily mean a reduction for the most poorly paid , but could be achieved merely by a reduction of differentials . The WPA divides its workers into four classifications , unskilled , intermediate , skilled , and professional and technical . In Region I it pays unskilled workers only $55 a month and technical workers $94 . If we think of WPA as primarily a relief measure , how can we justify this discrimination among persons on relief , under which one gets nearly twice as much a month as another ? An analysis of our present relief system , and the lack even of any single set of official statistics to let the country know clearly what actually is being spent on relief of all kinds , suggest the need both of a basic revision and a greater integration of the program .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
