Last week Columbia University showed off its prize catch of the season : visiting Nobelman Enrico Fermi of Rome , who will conduct advanced courses in theoretical physics this winter . Before a room full of eager chemists at Manhattan 's Hotel Pennsylvania , bright-eyed , bubbling Professor Fermi made clear and simple sense of his prize-winning specialty : disintegration of atoms . He told the chemists how he releases enormous quantities of energy through neutron bombardment , how , like a modern alchemist , he transforms one element into another . <P> Neutron bombardment is so simple , said Professor Fermi , that " even theoretical physicists " ( notorious for their aversion to laboratories ) can do it . First step in shooting at an atom is to secure a plentiful supply of ammunition neutrons , tiny particles with mass but no electric charge . Professor Fermi gets his pocketful of bullets by placing a pinch of beryllium with some radioactive gas , radon , in a small glass tube , shaped like an electric light bulb . The active particles from the gas strike the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next Physicist Fermi places the glass bulb , now full of neutrons , in contact with the element he wishes to bombard . He may , for instance , slip the bulb inside a finger-size cylinder of aluminum , leave it there for about an hour . Having no electric charge , the neutrons are immune to the negative electric fields surrounding the atoms , and the positive charges in the nuclei . So they leap unhindered into the hearts of the aluminum atoms , distend or crack them . When Professor Fermi removes the neutron tube , he inserts a Geiger-Miiller counter in its place , and the counter measures the exact amount of radioactivity ( energy ) produced . <P> Last step is chemical analysis of the new elements formed in the cylinder through " irritation " of aluminum atoms . These new elements are minute quantities of sodium and magnesium . <P> Although a terrific amount of Lilliputian energy is released in atomic disintegration ( TIME , Feb. 6 ) , there is , says Dr. Fermi , " no hope of a big explosion " at present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cracking a cupful of atoms to drive locomotives , blow up the Western Front .
