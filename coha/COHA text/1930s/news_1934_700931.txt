txt At midnight the Council of the League of Nations adopted unanimously by a roll-call vote a resolution settling peacefully Yugoslavia 's appeal to the League against Hungary as involved in the greatest assassination since Sarajevo . This came after the nations had skated all day on the thin Balkan ice with more than one ominous cracking sound . That was why the Council , seizing a favorable moment and tanking no chances on what a day 's delay might bring , held its first night session in at least six years . The happy ending came with the British and French working together so closely that the French Foreign Minister , Pierre Laval , jovially showed an international group of correspondents in the corridor a paper on which was typed a statement he would soon make to the Council thanking Captain Anthony Eden , British Lord Privy Seal , for his resolution , and then said : " You see we are so close together that my statement is even written on official British stationery . " Resolution Is a Compromise . The resolution , like all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hungarian Government was responsible in any way as Yugoslavia had originally demanded and without absolving Hungary completely as Budapest had originally demanded , it expressed the opinion that " certain Hungarian authorities may hake assumed , at any rate through negligence , certain responsibilities relative to acts having connection with the preparation of the Marseilles crime . " It ruled it was incumbent upon . Hungary to " take at once appropriate punitive action in the case of any of its authorities whose culpability may have been established , " but it depended on Magyar pride to execute this and ' report back to the Council . " Convinced of the good-will of the Hungarian Government to perform this , " the Council said in its resolution , it requests that government to " communicate to the Council the measures it takes to this effect . " The resolution spoke of " the knightly King Alexander I of Yugoslavia , the unifier , " as , a gesture to the country whose government believes his assassination was planned as a blow against the nation 's unity . It gave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by treaty revisionists , the satisfaction of ruling that the League Covenant 's obligations to respect the territorial integrity and existing political independence of members made it especially incumbent on League members not to tolerate or encourage , but repress and help repress political terrorism . But it gave Hungary and Italy the satisfaction of not reproving their revisionism and not citing Article X of the Covenant directly as the Little Entente had desired . Legislation to Be Studied . Having settled peacefully a matter in a field in which no recognized law exists , the Council then prepared in its resolution to fill this dangerous vacuum by international legislation . It established a committee of ten to study proposals to this effect with a view to negotiating a League convention against political terrorism . A French proposal submitted yesterday , which the committee will study , would establish a Permanent International Penal Court and give the Council the right to pardon those whom this court condemns . Only M. Laval and Baron Pompeo Aloisi of Italy spoke after Captain Eden had presented the resolution and both only in praise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally considered here that Yugoslavia , the Little Entente and France got the long end of the compromise and Hungary and Italy the short end . But although the revisionist movement seems likely to be retarded , no bones , diplomatic or otherwise , were broken and no prospects of rapprochement in any field , including the Franco-Italian , seem to have been injured . According to the Portuguese President of the Council , Dr. Augusto de Vasconcellos , it was the League that really won and that " deserved well of peace . " The night session came after a morning crowded with secret diplomatic activity and an afternoon resounding with public speeches and remarkable for public diplomacy . For during the translation of one of the most provocative speeches one could see in the lobby reserved for delegates and the press four heads together with every one else by tacit agreement standing out of earshot . The four men were M. Laval , Captain Eden , Baron Aloisi and Koloman de Kenya the Hungarian Foreign Minister . M. Laval did most of the talking and it was earnest until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all laughed and went back to hear the next speech . The public session lasted for five hours until 8:30 P. M. Then there was an adjournment until 10:30 . The meeting was delayed thereafter for forty minutes , awaiting the approval of Premier Julius Goemboes of Hungary for the resolution , which had been tele , - phoned to him . Council Hears Four Speeches . The Council heard auccessively from Nicolas Titulescu of Rumania , Eduard Benes of Czechoslovakia and Boske Jeftitch of Yugoslavia in rebuttal for the plaintiff and Tibor Eckhardt of Hungary closing for the defense  --  four long speeches full of blows for both sides , with a few extra for Italy and Poland . But the blows were meant mostly for home consumption and were expertly made to cover gloriously either retreat or advance by showing home opinion that national honor had been victoriously protected with big words in case a settlement were reached or providing plenty in the record to excite home opinion still more in case a settlement were not reached . There were carefully measured and more carefully veiled threats of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully measured offers of reconciliation and peace , sometimes provocatively put , as from M. Titulescu . It was the old story that the American eagle with arrows and an olive branch symbolizes , and one could take it either way . Said M. Titulescu , who eloquently read his oration from a sitting po-sition : " This dispute is one of those after which the interested parties can not return to their previous situations . After this dispute it is either rupture or rapprochement among those who today seem to be adversaries . " Warns of Growing Conflict . Said M. Benes after having argued that this was no time for legal justice but for political equity : " If the Council has not the courage to tell the truth politically we will go away from here and there will be danger that the conflict can continue to develop still more . " Said M. Jeftitch , the most moderate of the Little Entente who read so softly and rapidly that few could hear him : " The Yugoslav Government has wished by its moderation to facilitate the Council 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution to require condemnation of the actions for which the Hungarian authorities rendered themselves culpable regarding the Yugoslav nation , It considers a reprobation of these actions indispensable to calm the legitimate emotion that has taken hold of the Yugoslav people following certain particularly grave aspects of the Marseilles crime . " The Yugoslav Government has fulfilled to the end its duty of maintaining peace and waits now for the Council to fulfill its duty in this respect . The facts submitted to the Council are so evident that they allow it to take a position on the question before it . * ? * The Council must look the truth in the face , however painful it may seem in certain respects , for peace can only repose an respect for truth , justice and international morality . " Titulescu Makes Appeal . But M. Titulescu immediately after having predicted " rupture or rapprochement " added : " Needless to say , we prefer the second solution . We ask nothing of Hungary contrary to her national honor . It is asked only that she recognize frankly whatever faults her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . * * * Does Hungary believe we are here to humiliate her ? No . We are here simply as apostles of peace . To convince her I offer her my hand and say : " ' We wish to forget what you have said about us . Forget your false susceptibilities . Cooperate with us and give the Yugoslav nation the reasonable satisfaction she expulsions from Yugoslavia . He ' reminded the Council that they continued and now totaled 3,000 ; that the Yugoslav order had not been withdrawn as reported ; that the reason given for the ' deportations did not stand up and that Hungary , without making any reprisals , was still awaiting satisfaction . How serious the situation was may be seen from this statement by M. Titulescu , implying a partnership in the field by the Little and Balkan Ententes : " Do not forget that peace depends on a gesture , * * * Do not forget that what was easy yesterday is harder today and what is still easy today with good-will from every one can be impossible tomorrow . Let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things necessary for the maintenance of peace in a vast region . " Sparks flew not only in the pointed allusions by M. Titulescu to Italy as the country from which the assassins had got their arms , but also in this statement by M. Jeftitch regarding Italy , which imprisoned Dr. Ante Pavelitch as a suspect in the assassinations , but refuses his extradition ; " The Council learned with horror ' that the death sentence against King Alexander had been pronounced in Belgium . It is true that this so-called resolution was read in some centres of Yugoslav emigration on the direct instructions of Ante Pavelitch. ? ? * This resolution charged the said Pavelitch as chief of the terrorist organization to execute the sentence not only against the King , but members of the Belgrade Government . I shall add as a comment that the death sentence has not yet been executed against members of the Yugoslav Government and that the chief of the terrorist organization charged with the execution is beyond the reach of justice . " There was , however , one little constructive thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Titulescu and M. Benes 1 received some of M. Eckhardt 's points . It happens there is a peaceful way to revise treaties . It is contained partly In the Covenant 's I Article XIX , but neither Germany nor Hungary has ever turned to it , possibly because it seemed altogether hopeless . M. Titulescu himself reminded Hungary yesterday that Article XIX existed as a safety valve . In doing so he did not entirely shut the door this article was meant to provide , but left it slightly open and M. Eckhardt then noted not only this article 's existence but also thefact that it had ' originally been meant by Wilson to be part ' al Article X and to form a safety . valve for that article 's territorial guarantees . If it was a choice bee tween rupture and rapprochement yesterday . then this may point . febeS way for the rapprochement that was chosen . asks . Thereby you will have aided the cause of peace and all of us and yourselves . ' " And M. Benes , after having uttered the passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hungary , stressing that Czechoslovakia asked no more than this and did not desire to impugn Hungary 's honor . As to M. Jeftitch , early in his speech he had said : " The Hungarian representative , seconded therein by the Italian representative , tried to represent the Yugoslav appeal as an attack against the honor of the Hungarian people . I must declare there has never been in the mind of the the Yugoslav Government the idea of confusing the actions of certain Hungarian authorities with the sentiments of justice and honor of the Hungarian people . " In these circumstances M. Eckhardt took with dignity a position of moderation and a path of conciliation . Then M. Eckhardt , after having noted that M. Laval had said France stood with Yugoslavia but hoped for a reconciliation between her and Hungary , declared : " Hungary willingly joins her efforts to those of France making for this end . " Sees No Post-War Peace , M. Eckhardt added : " If you ask me why sixteen years after the war that threatened to ruin all mankind the Danube Valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all peoples desire it  --  I can answer by noting one fact : " A great Ambassador of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire left I for the guidance of his successors this dictum : ' For the victor in war or on the diplomatic battlefield the first essential is sincere reconciliation with the adversary . ' What has Hungary seen in sixteen years ? Has there been a single act of appease-ment ? " After having declared that the Danubian States depended so much on one another that misfortune for one was misfortune for all , he warned M. Benes : " If you lead us to hell you will have to come with us . " He paid a warm tribute to the " eminent services M. Benes has rendered the League when a disinterested party " and regretted that , M. Benes could not be impartial ' where Hungary was concerned , and it was evident that M. Benes took this reproach to heart . M. Eckhardt I turned then to the hand that the 1Little Entente had extended and concluded : " Hungary is ready to respond and associate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation and she will not be stopped in doing this by the bad treatment she has just received ) from the Little Entente govern- , nients . " Refers to Deportations . The Hungarian delegate merely kept the record open regarding the
