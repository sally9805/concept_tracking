The Foreign Press Association , founded in 1906 , enrols all the accredited foreign correspondents in Berlin . At the present time it includes about 135 men from 20 countries . Its president is Edgar Ansel Mowrer , who wrote last winter a shrewd analysis of the growth of reaction in Germany entitled Germany Puts the Clock Back . Last week President Mowrer called a sudden meeting of the Association . He reported that the German Government did not like his book . All sorts of wires were being pulled to force his resignation . Before returning to the U. S. , Ambassador Sackett had called at the German Foreign Office and pointed out that seeking revenge on one newspaper correspondent was not likely to increase the prestige of the Hitler Government . Correspondent Mowrer added : <P> " My own stand is this : Freedom of correspondents must not be hampered by any kind of social or personal pressure provided they report the news on the basis of reliable information . To clarify this point I offer my resignation . Please decide for yourselves . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their president . Immediately came a threat from gnomelike Minister of Propaganda Goebbels that the Foreign Press Association would be abolished for its brashness . <P> While the existence of the Foreign Press Association trembled in the balance , the German Government embargoed Britain 's revered and mighty Manchester Guardian . Its crime : printing specific cases of the beating of Jews , Socialists , women , the most detailed of which came from the Guardian 's special correspondent in Frankfort . The last case so reported was that of a street peddler sentenced to a year 's imprisonment because he was overheard to say that Jews were mistreated . The Guardian wrote last week : <P> " The prohibitions on foreign newspapers are not only a sign of spiritual oppression in Germany ; to the outer world they are proof of its rulers ' lack of confidence and of their incapacity . Too many people detest the actions of the present German Government ; too many agencies are working and will continue to work to spread the truth about it , for the prohibition of this paper or that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one will fail to understand .
