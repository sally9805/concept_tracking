txt There was a decided flavor of the 1890s about the robbery last evening of the Western Union telegraph office at 2133 South Michigan avenue . The bandits were young and inexperienced , they had no pistols and they were captured after an exciting bicycle chase . When the robbers entered one of them , Bernard Curley , 22 years old , 4556 Ellis avenue , wrote out a telegram , which he handed to Manager Matthew Gacki . It read : " Give me money or the fellow at the door will shoot you to death . " Gacki looked and saw that tho second bandit , John Redmond , 22 years old , 7146 Vernon avenue , held his right hand in his coat pocket with a fierce air . So he surrendered $23 . As the pair fled , Gacki called to two messengers , William Greenwood and Celeste ' Madoni , who were tinkering with their bicycles in an adjoining room . Promptly William and Celeste rolled out and the pursuit was on . Gacki then called the police and told them to please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were captured by Policemen Michael Regan and Frank Daly .
