Sixty years ago the Chicago , Burlington &; Quincy 's prime sales talk to prospective passengers was that its trains had been equipped with Westinghouse Air Brakes . . . . The Union Pacific boasted " one pure passenger train a day " out of Omaha , for San Francisco four days away . . . . Chicago , Rock Island &; Pacific ( " Safe-Reliable-Elegant " ) advertised that " its road bed is simply perfect and its track is laid with steel rails " ; its Pullman Palace Sleeping Cars " lighted by Pintsch Gas . " . . . Southern Pacific , in 1899 , assured magazine readers that " a Personal Conductor and Porter go through with the car . " <P> As time passed and train service came to be taken for granted , railroad advertising concerned itself largely with the tourist trade . Pictures of Nature 's grandeur , of Yellowstone geysers , California trout fishermen , New Mexico Indians , Florida bathing girls , New England sailboats , loomed large in railroad copy . " Vacationland " became a copywriter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutional campaigns . Lackawanna invented " Phoebe Snow , " the girl who traveled " The Road of Anthracite " without getting dirty . Pennsylvania Railroad told ad-readers all about its signal system . Baltimore &; Ohio dramatized its operation in a series of adventures ( all with happy endings ) involving personnel and passengers . Chesapeake &; Ohio shrewdly publicized itself as the road surveyed and " founded " by George Washington , made a brilliant paragraph of advertising history with its kitten " Chessie " snugly tucked in a berth ( " Sleep Like a Kitten " ) . <P> But with the exception of Chesapeake &; Ohio , railroads did not keep up a sustained institutional advertising program , as do the automobile and tobacco industries . In 1933 they placed 96% of their space in newspapers , mostly sporadic " point-to-point " ( i. e. timetable ) copy . <P> With threats of Government ownership , increased competition from automobiles , buses , airlines , and a steady decline in passenger traffic , the railroads pulled themselves together , struck back with airconditioning , streamlining , high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The problem was not so much to popularize travel or sell individual tours as to make rail-riding look attractive once more . To do that job , 26 railroads and Pullman Co. combined for the first time in a joint institutional advertising campaign which comes to a climax next week with Railroad Week . <P> The 26 roads-all Western-dug into their lean purses for $450,000 to buy space in 388 newspapers , four national magazines . Typical layouts : <P> " Romance Returns to the Railroads , " showing a beauteous girl , spick &; span in spotless white dress , lounging happily in an air-conditioned car . ( " . . . Like taking a luxurious overland cruise . " ) <P> " Fresh as the Breath of Spring , " showing the same girl perched on a trunk . ( " Always fair weather aboard these trains . " ) <P> " Men Can Wear White Linens Now . " <P> " As Quiet as the Dawn . " <P> ' ' Mild as May on the Santa Fe. "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
