Selma wanted to smile at the soft , empty look in Milly 's face as she thought back into those lost times . " Ja , I suppose , " she said , " but I 'm alone in the world , Milly , I 've got to fare for myself .... " Milly started from her reverie and pulled a gold watch from her belt . She snapped the cover open . Then , " Gott ! " she said . " Eleven-thirty already ! How are your eggs , Selma ? " Selma smiled at her . " Fresh like always , Milly . Just came in this morning . A dozen ? " " 7a , please . " As she bent under the counter and began to lay the eggs in a bag , Selma wondered why she had said that , for she knew as well as anything that the eggs she was putting in the bag had been in the store since the Wednesday before . Under the counter , she grinned a little . Milly wo n't know the difference , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " How 's Hank now ? I heard he was sick . " This was something that was in a pattern , something coming again , repeating itself out of some other time , or out of some decaying dream , and something that was the same except that before it was her mother , waiting in a draughty hall with an old coat thrown over her on an autumn night with the wind high , and it was Selma for whom she was waiting , who was away with her lover , who came back at last to find her mother , raging at first and then pleading with her , begging out of deep love and wisdomand age . Now it was spring , and now it was Selma who was doing the waiting , screened behind the thick ivy that covered the little back porch , watching them , waiting while her rage grew inside her like a low flame soon to soar . P101She had come home at six o'clock after locking up the store , pleased with herself , for she had heard just before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock because everybody was coming to her to buy it , and it was only two years since she had started handling cheese . She had walked swiftly home because that news had taken all the accumulated weariness of a day of standing in the store out of her body , out of her bones , made her fresh and strong again , as if it were the beginning of the day and not the end , feeling powerful and ready to meet the world and anything in it . She had come home and the first thing she noticed was that there was no smell of coffee in the house and when she got into the kitchen , she saw that there was no sign of Lisa , not even a fire started in the stove . She stood still for a second , wondering , and in that moment she heard a sound from outside that told her something instantly  --  Lisa 's laugh , rich and deep , coming from outside , and some one else 's voice , a man 's , talking low to her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ivy , parted it with her fingers and looked out into the garden behind the house . Then there was the first spark of the fire , a sudden quick anger at her sister , idling in the garden ( and with that tramp , that Stevens ! ) when she should have been inside with supper ready on the table . All day she slaved , came home hungry and tired , and then found nothing ready , and Lisa , dreamy and half-sick with love or something she thought love , was idling her time away , Selma completely forgotten and all her duties to her . It was that kind of anger at first , resentment and a personal grievance , but as she peered through the ivy at the scene in the garden , that anger died down in a moment and then another kind leapt up . Lisa lay in the hammock , swung between a post of thepIO2grape arbor and a flowering cherry tree . Her head was on a pillow so that Selma could see her face , flushed and smiling , her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too that Lisa wore no apron , that she was dressed up for the man in her purple voile , her finest lace at neck and sleeves . Her hands were behind her head , and her body lay stretched out with her feet crossed at the foot of the hammock , and she was laughing that low , full laugh of hers into the face of the man who was half-kneeling , halfsittingon the ground beside her , talking still , quietly , so that while Selma on the porch could hear his voice and could imagine from the sound of it what sort of things he was saying , she could not hear his words , could not separate them from each other , and know . But she did know . She knew as she watched what kind of stuff he was whispering , what kind of nonsense he was pouring into her head , how he was feeding her silly ideas about love , makingher more silly and more dreamy , so that she would walk around after this more vague than ever , more forgetful , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be doing . She had not thought it serious before , but now as she watched Lisa 's face and saw the look on it , the soft look of tenderness for the man , the unmistakable look of love , she thought differently . But until now it had not seemed importantthat the man , this Stevens , kept coming around to call on her and to take her out , because Selma had thought that Lisa was as remote to him , as lost in dreamingto him , as she was to her and to Elsie and to the people in the store she waited on , and every one and everything she met . Even the man had seemed unimportant . She knew that there had been balls and buggy rides and a picnicor two at the mill and God knows what else , of whichpI03she could not be bothered to keep track , but when she had mentioned Stevens 's name to Lisa before , he had seemed not to matter to her at all , his name seemed to mean nothing more than any name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little about him , that he came from a city somewhere , Cincinnati or some such place , that he was poor and idling , that his job , when he had one , was putting on shows , that he had put on the minstrel show a month before for one of the lodges , and that half the girls in town were in love with him , mooning about him when they were alone and giggling when he was near . All this had come to her and she had vaguely heard it , but it was like everything in the town that was not in her own life , that did not touch her closely  --  vague , a remote , faint happening that had no realness and no importance because it had nothing or little to do with her . It did not disturb her because it did not come near her , nor did it interest her . Thus it was with all things in the town . But now  --  she looked again at Lisa , whose hand had come from behind her head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the man there in her garden , filling Lisa with notions , it was suddenly different , and all the vague things she had heard about the man came together suddenly and tightened into a hard picture of a worthless rake and a hard knot of disapproval in her mind . She looked out through the vines and saw the wind ruffle the new leaves of the grape arbor , saw it move through the cherry trees and send a shower of blossoms floating clown over the hammock , and one caught in the dark tangle of Lisa 's hair . It was the old story over again , the story she knew by heart , that she was never going to forget . It was the old story of the worthless man and the silly girl with money , the old story of the softness that comes round thepI04 heart and destroys the sinews of the brain , that makes you mad with longing and loneliness and passion that can never be cured with soft mouths alone , that leaves you finally with a hardness in your heart that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . It was that story . It was something in a pattern , something that had come back now into her life , only now she was her mother and silly Lisa with her dreaming eyes was Selma ten , eleven years before . And that other time now ceased to be the ruinous dream that it had become , it was suddenly with her again , alive and real , but the sadness had gone out of it , and it was only the knowledge of her hatred for the mess her life had been , her hatred for a man who could have done that to her life , it was only that that sprang up in her now , like a flame , soaring in her , half blinding her with sudden rage that here was such another man , and here such another girl , and that the same thing was going to happen again , all in that pattern . The man leaned closer toward Lisa 's face , and her smile went away , and she was very serious then , with that deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hair which shone gold in the setting sun of the spring day . Shadows of leaves were on her face , and her mouth fallen open a little , her lips parted in swooning , was like a shadow there . As Selma watched , she thought that she could almost feel on her own cheek the quick breath that came through Lisa 's parted lips , the breath hot and fast with longing and the loneliness that his mouth on hers could begin to kill . And as she looked at them then , peering still through the place in the ivy that her fingers made , she knew that Lisa was not as she had been , it only seemed that she was , that Lisa now was all soft and trembling and lost to herself , that she had no wish and no power to help herself ,  |p1O5that  all she wanted was to be lost in him and in the deeper , madder yearning of his mouth on hers . Selma was as real to herself now as she had been in that other time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself ( or would have if she had thought ) as something hard and swift and made to handle people and things , and not be handled . And Charlie to her then was not as this man was to Lisa now , for as she looked at him , as she looked at his strong face in the dusking light , at the way he held his head and the way his chin jutted out over Lisa 's face , then Selma knew that this Stevens was not such a man as Charlie had been , that he would get what he wanted , and that Lisa , all soft with love , would be no barrier to his want . She had been different , and Charlie had been different , she hard and not afraid and sure that whatever happened would be what she wished , and Charlie soft , and doing what was wished . Hard and powerful she had thought herself , hard so that she could not be hurt and powerful so that she could make things come as she wanted them and would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been . So here now was Lisa , with a man better than she in power and in hardness , but worthless as Charlie , a trooping minstrel , handsome and without a job and without prospects , a man who trooped from town to town and found in every town one such soft and clinging girl whom he could make his own ; and how Lisa would be hurt then , and how powerless she would be in his hands , in the hands of such a man . It was the old unfair story , different but the same , the story that her mother tried to tell her but which she did not believe , which she thought she did not need to believe , even if it was true , because she was strong , both in power and in love , and could make things come as she wantedp106them to be . It was that old defeat , bitter in her mouth suddenly since the ten years that had passed over it and she had begun to think of life as a battle to be fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hard and the careful , a defeat bitterer now than then , because then she had not yet seen life that way , because she was still young and half in love with rottenness herself . So now it was Lisa 's turn , but Lisa , broken , would not revive as she had done , being that much different from her , that much less strong , that much more a woman . And so now it was her turn to play her mother 's part , only that was going to be different too , stronger and no begging in it , but just as wise ; but more hate in it for such men and less love . She saw the man 's mouth come close to Lisa 's , saw how Lisa suddenly strained upward and caught his neck in her arms , and pulled his mouth down on hers , saw them together that way , with the cherry sending down its soft shower of white , and the blossoms lying soft and still on their hair , unknown to them as they lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their mouths , killing that loneliness , throwing wood on the fire of their need . And then the hate in her against such men burst suddenly , and as if Lisa were herself , as if she were herself rushing back into that time ten years ago , saving herself , she rushed off the porch and down into the garden and was tugging suddenly at the man 's coat , and screamingsome words to Lisa that none of them , not even she , could understand . The man stumbled backwards to his feet and looked at Selma , white with rage , in embarrassed surprise , and Lisa , struggling in the hammock to get up , suddenly came to her feet and faced her sister , her face white , too , with a less quick anger but without shame. pI07 " Selma , " she cried , " what do you mean by this ? Have you no decency ? " She rubbed her hand across her unbelieving , outraged face . Selma clenched her hands together at her sides , forced herself into calmness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Do n't tell me anything about decency , girl . Get in the house . I 'll take care of this . " But Lisa , with a sudden display of force , came close to Selma and whispered harshly to her , " You keep out of this . It 's none of your business . " Selma laughed a little . " It 's my business that I have n't got any supper , is n't it ? " Lisa looked suddenly foolish , and almost at once she was aware of her appearance , her hair fallen over her shoulders , and her dress twisted on her body . She pulled at her waist , straightened the tight purple cloth over her full breast . Then , foolishly , she asked , " What time is it ? " " It 's way after six . Go on in now and see if there 's anything for supper . " But then her look of foolishness left her , and the feeling , and the time and her appearance were both of no importanceas she looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his lips . She put out her hands , and her eyes were suddenly limpid with apologetic tears . " I 'm sorry , Burt . I 'm sorry this had to happen . " He shrugged his shoulders and smiled at her , as if to say that it could not matter . But then Selma took her eyes off Lisa for a moment and swung round to face him , angry again . " Young man , this is my property and I do n't want you on it . Get out . " " Selma ! " A sharp call from Lisa . " Be quiet , Lisa . This is my property , and as long as you 're on it , I 'm taking care of you . That means that he 's got to get off and not come back . Go on ! "  |p108Stevens  looked at Lisa . His blue eyes were amused , but as if in deference to Selma , he did not smile again . " Do you want me to go ? " he asked , his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how her whole body dissolved at his glance , how lost she was to him , how mad with yearning for his mouth on hers and his body against hers , how a single word , a single glance from him was enough to turn her soft and harried with love of him . " Wait , " Lisa said , and turning to Selma , " What have you got against him , Selma ? You do n't even know him . You 've never noticed him before . " Selma laughed . " I know him , " she said . " I know him all right . And I know what he wants . " " You do n't know him . You could n't , Selma , if youwanted to ! He 's not like you , any more than I am ! " Selma laughed again , a low , hard laugh in her throat . " I know him and I know what he wants , " she said . " What does he want ? " She turned to Stevens again . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asked of him . Stevens shrugged , but anger began to glow in his eyes and his mouth firmly shut . " What does he want ? " Lisa cried again . " Do n't you think I know ? Mein Gott , have n't I gone through all of this ? Do we both have to be fools once before we can be wise , and pay for it the way I did ? " Lisa looked at her , empty anger in her face . " What does he want ? " she asked feebly , helpless in the face of Selma 's passion . " Well , it is n't you , you foolish girl . Any more than it was me that Charlie wanted . It 's your money and nothing else . Get that through your head . "  |p109Lisa  turned to Stevens , baffled and unbelieving . " Tell her she 's crazy , " she said . He put his arm around Lisa 's shoulder . " Do n't listen to her , Lisa . She is . You know what I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she flung his arm from Lisa 's shoulder . " Let me tell you something , " she said to him . " Our mother was no fool , and when she died she left me in charge of Lisa , and Lisa does n't get her money until she marries somebody that I say yes to , and that one is n't you . Is it queer ? Well , maybe so , but it 's a fact . Tell him that it is , Lisa . You know . " " Sure it is , " Lisa said . " But it does n't matter . And if you keep back what Mama left me because I 'm going to marry him then I 'll do it just to show you how wrong you are . " Selma laughed again . " All right , " she said . " See if he does . Get out of here now , Stevens , and you , too , Lisa , if you 're going with him . I 'm sick of this . " She turned quickly away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thrust sticks of wood into the stove and poured kerosene over them , then struck a match to the wood and started the fire burning . She put the tea kettle on the stove and went into the pantry , came out again with eggs on a plate , and a bowl into which she began to break them , deliberately and slowly , trying to cool her rage , telling herself as she broke the eggs one after another into the bowl , that it was foolish to worry about it because she was convinced that she was right , and if that Stevens would marry Lisa now she would never try to judge another man . I n the bowl she began to beat the eggs together . Then Lisa came in , the hard flush of anger in her face not yet drained away.  |p11O  Selma looked up . " I 'm sorry I did that , Lisa . But I had to . I went through all that ; I ca n't let you do it , blindly , when I know all the time what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like I do , through and through , as if he 'd been around here all my life . Do n't be angry at me , Lisa . It was for you . " Lisa began to smile . " Selma , " she said , " after this I would n't stay here if I could . You do n't know him and you do n't know me . All you know is CharlieVerkle , and Burt Stevens is n't like that . All you know is yourself and I 'm not like that . " Selma 's face looked gray . " Kind ! What do you mean ? He 's gone , is n't he ? " " 7a , he 's gone  --  " " Then I was right ! " " No ! I 'm going , too ! In ten minutes I 'm meeting him ! We 're going to Milwaukee tonight ! " She turned quickly and went into the next room , and from where she sat in the kitchen , Selma could hear her feet quickly running up the stairs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her mouth had fallen open and her hand , which all the time had been stirring the eggs with a spoon , was suddenly still , limply holding the spoon . Only now , late in the afternoon , was there a moment to sit down , a moment to rest herself in the shadows at the back of the store where the few customers who came in ( so few now , just before five o'clock , that Lisa could take care of them alone ) could not see her where she did not have to bother further with words and smiles that she didp111not mean , when her mind was not on people anyway , on their ills and their crops and all the things that they were willing and anxious to tell her , but only on what they bought and how much they bought and how much she made on each sale ( it was a habit now to calculate quickly , whenever she sold anything , exactly what her profit on that sale was ) . The good-days and the how-are-yous , the inquiries after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calamities  --  these were the polite intimacies through which she tied her customers to the store , so that once they came in there to buy they almost never went any other place , feeling that they were friends there . But all of these , the empty words and the empty cordial smiles , were nothing at all to her but endlessshams , covering calculations , and they wearied her , so that sometimes her face was like a hard mask that did not want to relax from the frozen stiffness of her false smile , like her body after a day of standing and reaching up and bending down and running back and forth  --  a hard , knotted thing reluctant to relax , so that it was harder for her to rest sometimes than it was to work , ( because her body seemed ready to jump up and wait on a customer , her face ready to freeze into the polite smile at every instant , even when , like now , her brain told her that she was tired and should sit down and let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sitting down at last after such a harrowing day as this had been . Sitting there in the shadows at the back of the store ( where she lit the lamps only on Saturday nights and at other such times when the place was crowded ) she rememberedother Mondays , remembered times before Christian Kruger had come to town to begin his stock-days , when Monday was a time of impatient waiting and early clos-pII2 ing and almost no business . But that was different now and Mondays were almost Saturdays , if you measured the days of the week by the business you did , the farmers starting to come early in the morning and not leaving until well in the middle of the afternoon , and then burdenedagain with the things they had bought , and the total in the cash register sometimes running high in three figures . Now on Mondays she did not have to sit around waiting or stand in the window looking out , nervous and irritable , for she was too busy , and before noon , when Lisa had to go home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schremmer to help her and to stay there while she went home to eat . How well she had done ! Now Elsie was seven and in school , so that Lisa did not have to stay at home to mind her any more , but could come down regularly and help in the store , her help needed badly , too . That saved hiring Schremmer steadily , though even that might be necessary some day not too far off , for even now she could almost stand to have another clerk in the store ; but that would make her own task too easy , and it gratifiedher to work hard and steadily , to exhaust herself in it , to feel in her own weariness what she was accomplishingin her business . It was gratifying to be so tired that her aching , tightly-knotted muscles would not let her sleep sometimes , but stayed taut and left her ready to jump up and serve . But slowly now , as she sat there with her hands pressed over her aching eyes , she could feel her body relax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and warm in all the stiff , tight muscles and the knotted , waiting nerves , so that she slumped down in her chair and put her head against its back and her feet out in front of her , resting suddenly , and too luxuriously inert to move or turn herp113head even when the door of the store opened and she heard Lisa 's voice , and some voice answer that she did not know . She turned her head finally , just enough to see the front of the store , her curiosity more important than her ease , and she saw up at the front of the store , under the lamps , some late farmer who did not come there often , asking for mittens . Mittens made her think with distaste of the trip to Milwaukee that she would have to make soon , in a week now or ten days , to fill up the gaps in her winter stock , and slumped there in her chair she did not want to think longer of that trip , or think of ever getting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stirred herself at last to strike a match and light the lamp on her desk there at the back of the store . Last week 's paper lay folded on its top , still unread , and she picked it up and glanced at the rows of type , and then turned the front page over to look at the advertisements in the middle section . She saw her own block first , large and imposing , the two-inch black letters prominent on the page . She glanced over the list of summer fabrics she had put on sale on Saturday ( and almost all of them sold now though half of them were faded ) , and then at her name at the bottom of the block : Fr . Selma Verkle , Prop . Then , more casually , she looked at other advertisements on those pages , smaller than hers , cheaper , less noticeable , and with most of the goods they advertised marked higher . She smiled briefly , knowing as she did what fools most merchants in the town were , how they did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they did not know how to sell it , how to get rid of it when they needed to , and how , in all the stores in town but hers , the shelves were heavy with stock that was many seasons old . She had got it from her mother and her mother from her father ,  | he who had had this store first in the town ( after the man who had built it and through his inability lost it ) and built it up from a failure to what it was now . She turned back to the front page . Selbstmord , she saw at the head of a column , and then glanced idly half-way through the report of a farmer who had hanged himself with fence wire , but half-way through the account her tired mind lost interest and was drifting back to that other time when she had read Selbstmord and had seen on the page before her the account of Charlie Verkle 's suicide , in some God-forsaken place out in Iowa where he had landed finally as a bartender . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend bar , where he could get all he wanted to drink for nothing , and he could lounge his days away with loafers like himself , never in a saloon wanting the kind of company for which he had been made . What she always wondered about ( when she did remember it ) was why he had done it by cutting his veins . Was it because that was less violent than almost any other way , less painful , the blood just slowly draining away until you died of a deep-drained weakness which was like sleep ? Was it because hanging , that sudden quick jerk at the neck , and the snap , was too hard a thing for him to face ? Or was he afraid that if he got up on a chair and put the rope around his neck he would not have the nerve to kick the chair away , to meet that snapping of the neck , that violent , sudden end ? She tried to picture him , drunken , his hair fallen down over his eyes , his moustache drooping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him open his jack knife and suddenly slash at one wrist and then at the other , his loose mouth twisted in an abrupt pain that he did not expect , and then slumping back in a chair and letting the blood run out on the floor , and slowly falling asleep withp115the weariness that came over him . It was somehow easy to realize all of that , more easy than it was to picture him , for now with seven years between them , he was only a dim and floating shadow in her remembrance , something pale and rotting , cast out and to be forgotten . But she could have guessed how he would do it  --  as he had done everything in his life , without force , weakly , seeking the easiest ( and the longest ) way . So it was no surprise to her . It was what she knew would sometime happen . That was two years ago , when Elsie was five , too young to understand , though she had tried to explain to her what had happened to her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was and what did he look like and why did he go away when other girls had fathers at home , until at last Selma had given up the idea of trying to tell her , resolved to wait until the child was nine or ten or more , and if by then she did not know from the talk of children , she would tell her again , more plainly , tell her everything from her marriage to Charlie to Lizzie Krahl , how she had been disgraced at that vile woman 's hands and by her own blindness to the creature she married , and she would tell too how the town had been indignant at the divorce and at the Krahl woman both , and how people had finally made the life of that woman so unendurable that she , too , like Charlie , had to go away , disappear from the town in the night never to be heard from again and since forgotten by it . She would show Elsie the clipping which told of Charlie 's death , for she had saved it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the safe perhaps with old papers and letters ; for she wanted Elsie to know exactly what Charlie was , and what a rottenness in her blood she would have to fight all of her days . Her eye moved back to the paper , to a plea by thepI16 editor for two needed improvements : a wing dam in the river as other towns were putting in to deepen the channel for larger boats than could now come down from Kilbourn , where the large dam was beginning to fill the river with sand , and for electric lights on the streets and some kind of lighthouse by the bridge for the boats that could once more come when the dam had been built . Lights would come soon enough , like everything else , like all the changes that the last twenty years had brought , and it would be a fine thing to have them . She would install them in the store at once , for it would be a real boost to her trade , but at home they would get along with lamps for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it was to get along without a telephone , though in the store she needed , of course , to have one . As for the boats on the river , that was one of the editor 's wild ideas again , better left unsaid . What good were boats now except for excursions ? There were plenty of amusements in the village as it was , too many . The train took care of all the transportation needed for the town , and did it quicker , and even though once in a while the engine went off the track , and two , three years before ( the years when her business was worse than it had ever been since she had begun ) the thing had stopped running entirely because of that strike , trains were neverthelesssafer and more reliable than boats . You could not do much with boats if you were in the cattle business like Christian Kruger was , and that was the most important thing that had come to the town for ten years . Then she was reading that Fraulein Bertha Tanzer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , and she suddenly thought , Poor Lisa ! Poor Lisa ! But that was the way the world went . You had to learn for yourself . She had , and so had Lisa . But it wasp117sad , the way that had happened ! If only the child had listened to her in the first place . She remembered how Lisa had flung out of the house without even saying goodbye , and she had run to the window and called after her , but the girl was on her way to the depot and not long after she heard the seven-five pull out and knew that it was too late , that Lisa was on the train with that man , Stevens . But two days later she was back , and never the same since , and now , staring at the paper , Selma remembered how she looked on her return , and how she acted , how she came limping into the house and , seeing Selma , flung herself down on the floor and clutched her skirt and begged to be taken back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could talk , for she was crying so hard , and she told her that sordid and familiar storyhow the man had taken her to a hotel and stayed there with her , and how , next morning , he was gone and not even the bill was paid , and how she stood on a bridge for an hour that afternoon , trying to get up the courage to jump into the murky river , until finally a policeman came and made her move along . Selma had put her to bed at last and she had kissed her for the first time that night in many years , but after that never again and Lisa never the same , dreamy still but in a different way , having nothing to do with men any more nor with any one at all if she could help it , living in some kind of hard shell that nothing could penetrate , and going through her life as if there were nothing in it , as if nothing in it made any difference . And that week in the newspaper it said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there for several days . No one ever knew . Some one came in at the front of the store again and Selma turned to look . It was Christian Kruger . She sawp118him walk up to Lisa and heard him talk to her , and heard , too , Lisa 's short , muttered answers . There was a man , though ! Her weariness was gone suddenly . She stood up and looked in the mirror over her desk . She straightened her hair , tightened the knot at the back of her head , and wondered if she should go on combing it that way . It was not fashionable , she knew , and when she went to Milwaukeeor Chicago she did it differently , with a rat and all , but here in Sacton it was good enough , simple and easy when you got up in the morning and were in a hurry . Nothing easier than to pull it back tight like that and fasten it all in a knot . And when your hair was beginning to fade besides , as hers was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you combed it . She looked at her face for a moment longer and she thought then how different it was from that picture of herself in the parlor , or from that smaller picture where she was all dressed up in fine satin and leaning over a chair , a fan in her hand . But that was long ago . When had it been taken , how many years ago ? Ten , maybe fifteen years . That was a long time . Now her face was lined , and in the lamp light it looked worn with shadows . Her mouth was small and her lips seemed thinner than she could remember them , more firmly closed in a tight line . Not handsome any more , she knew , but she knew , too , that the face she looked at was the face of a business woman , a woman of the world , a strong woman . She heard Kruger laugh his hearty laughter and at the sound of it she blew out the lamp and went up to the front of the store where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , and gave him her hand . " Selma , " he said . " Wie geht 's ? " pI19They began to talk and Selma , at least , was oblivious of Lisa who sat quietly back behind the counter , her eyes lost to the things around her and to the two people before her . She did not hear Selma say , " Kruger , your Pferdearktwas the best thing that ever happened for me , the best thing . " Kruger smiled . " Ya , it 's a good thing for me , too , Selma . I did n't know there was so much money in this county . " " There 's money everywhere , Kruger , " she said , smilingback at him . " But the thing is if you know how to get " Ja , ja , " he laughed , the lines around his eyes crinkngup , and his smile hidden in his beard . She heard his tighter dying and she saw his eyes turn again to Lisa , inningly , as if they knew some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , too . That 's a good thing , too . But Lisa looked away , aware suddenly and with pain her face , as though she knew that secret thing , too , d as though its taste were bitter to her . She looked away ward the back of the store and kept her eyes there , til Kruger turned again to Selma and looked at her ine same way , as if to say , We know , do n't we ? We know . Then Lisa stood up suddenly . " It 's almost six , Selma . Ca n't we close up now ? " Selma felt her weariness again , in spite of Kruger'sence , as if his presence had given her only a momen-y ease , and she said , " 7a , I guess we might as well . There 's nobody else coming tonight . " She went to the back of the store and closed her desk.T hen , lifting the cover of the cash register once more , sheread again the amount of that day 's sales , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure on theregister , she emptied the drawer into a strong box andpI20 put it in the safe , twirling the dial before she rose to put on her hat and cloak . Kruger helped them blow out the lamps and walked half a block with them , but there , at the corner where the women were to turn , he left them to go on to the hotel where he lived , and under the flaring lamp on the corner , Selma could see that he still had in his eyes that proud and amused look for a secret that he had and could keep as long as was needed . The women went on home . It was a night in late September , and the air was heavy with smoke from the burning marshes to the south and from the fires of piles of leaves all over the town . The wind blew , too , cool to the skin , and refreshing . " Wie suss die Luft ist ! " Lisa said . Selma looked at her quickly . It was strange to hear her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . But sweet ? There was smoke in the air that tingled in the nostrils , but nothing sweet , nothing suss . Now , if Lisa could be herself again , would she still be the same silly , mooning girl , dreaming of sweetness ? Would she have learned nothing ? Would there be no more steel in her body or no more coldness in her blood ? " He 's a good man , Lisa , " Selma said then , knowing as she did , that secret , too , knowing that to Kruger , Lisa did not seem the same as she did to her . She was no fool to him , who did not know about that trip to Milwaukee , nor did she seem strange in her aloofness , for he had never known her otherwise . To him she was a young woman with a fine body , high breast and softly rounded arms , with dark , dreaming eyes , and a red flush in her cheeks , a woman whom he wanted , and not the poor lost thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuttingpI2Ilife out . To Kruger , she was life . She repeated as they walked , " A good man , Lisa . " But Lisa had lapsed back into her habitual reverie andshe only murmured some short and faint reply that was aught up by the wind at once and blown beyond Selma 's caring . But she could imagine what kind of thing it wasat Lisa had said , and she smiled to herself as they hurried wn the length of the block , knowing that she , too , uld keep her secret , could wait as long as was needed see what would happen . The clanging bell sound brought her up sharply out ofcep , instantly awake , sitting upright and tense in hereel , peering into the darkness ahead of her , stiff withfight . It was fire somewhere , and instantly , as always , mind was at the store , which she already saw in es and not one thing saved . She jumped out of bed ran to her window , hoping that she would see the to the west ruddy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clanged insistently . Then , without taking time to cover her nightdress , she rushed out into the and to the windows facing the east , and there she the night bright with red , just where the store was . Her hands flew to her cheeks as she screamed , " Lisa ! el " But Lisa was already running down the length of hall from her room , and through an open door came abrupt sound of Elsie screaming in fright . " Cott , it 's the store ! " Selma yelled . " The store , Lisa , store ! " " Let me see , " Lisa said , her voice calmer , and then she peered out of the window toward the ruddy patch on sky . " It looks like it , " she said .  --  pI22 " Come on ! " Selma rushed back into her room and in the darkness tried to find her clothes . Then outside she could hear the sound of feet running on the wooden walk and she forced herself to raise the window and call down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Kalber 's . . . " the voice of some man cried up to her , and then some other voice , " It 's Kalber 's , half burned down already . " At the open window , with the icy winter wind blowing into her face , she sank to her knees and clasped her hands together . " Danke , Gott , danke , danke , " she whispered , fervent with gratefulness and faith in a God she had not addressed in  --  how long ?  --  eight , perhaps ten years . Then she got up again , and as she pulled on a skirt and waist over her nightgown , she called to Lisa through the open door , " Dank ' Gott , it 's Kalber 's , Lisa . It 's Kalber 's . " Lisa appeared in the doorway , a vague blur of whiteness . " What should we do with Elsie ? She 's crying herselfsick . " " Dress her . Dress her . We 've got to take her along . I 'm going . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs and in the darknesssnatched up her cloak from the place in the hall where it hung , pulled her hat down on her head , grabbed gloves and rushed out . Then she joined the running people on the street and ran with them down the length of the block to Water Street and then the block to the place where the flames were roaring up to the sky . It was Kalber 's , but so wrapped in flames that you could not tell what the building looked like or how much of it had already been destroyed . But it seemed that half the town was there , all the women standing in the middlepI23of the street , stamping their feet on the hard , beaten snow , their faces red with the color of the fire . Selma saw that the wind was to the east , away from the store , over the ice-covered river , and she knew that the store was safe . She brought her hands together again and on the fringe of the crowd she thanked in mind her forgotten God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could see the hose turned toward the flames , spurting its feeble stream of water into the burning mass , and lesseningthe flames almost not at all . Then suddenly over the crackling sound of the flames came the crashing noise of falling beams , and almost at the same time the men cried out in dismay , and like a small wave , the whole crowd of women pushed to the sidewalk nearer the fire , so that they could see what was wrong . Selma , on the edge of the crowd , could look down to the river bank , and there , in the fire 's bright light , she could see the men futilely pumping the handle of the fire engine , up and down , easily and without effort , because something had happened to k and no water came out of the hose held toward the fire . There were screams and shouts and confusion , and suddenlyhorses came running up the street , their hooves striking sharply on the snow-crust over the hard earth , pulling a wagon covered with pails . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the sharp chopping noise al some one breaking a larger hole in the ice of the river , and then the pails began to move up and down the lines , up and down , the head man flinging the water from eachit toward the fire , and each pailful like less than a dropthe roaring mass . Lisa was suddenly beside her , holding Elsie . The child had lost her fright , but you could see where the cold windpI24 had dried the tears on her cheeks , and as she stared wide-eyed at the fire , her face very serious and her body wrapped from head to foot in an enormous shawl that Lisa had flung about her , she looked quaint and almost like an old woman , looked like an old dwarf though she was only eight . " Everything is lost here , " Selma said , looking at Lisa . " Poor old Kalber . " Selma covered her mouth with her gloved hand . " Look at him , " she whispered to Lisa . They saw him , dancing before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood they could hear his curses . " Even this can only make him lose his temper , " Selma said . " Who do you suppose he 's blaming now ? " Lisa said , " Poor man , poor man . " " He 'll go crazy . " Kalber suddenly ran toward the line of men handling the pails and began to shout at them , but what he shouted was lost to the crowd of women and children , for now the whole building was beginning to fall , and a cry went up from the crowd and the whole group moved back like a dark wave in the street as one wall of the building was suddenly revealed free of flames , a great , barren , windowlessbulk , and then crashed in toward the center of the fire . The flames leapt higher in the sky , and turning toward the river again , looking over the ice that glowed pink in the light , Selma could see by the flames the island on the other side , and each snow-covered hill , almost as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south . " Look , " she said . " It 's just as if the sun were coming up . You can see everything over there . " Another wall crashed into the flames and again there was a cry from the women , a long wail blown on thepI25wind with the sound of the fire . Then the air began to fill with another smell than smoke  --  the pungent smell of meat , roasting at first , and then the more acrid smell of its burning , turning to cinders . More beams fell , and the fire suddenly much smaller , as if there were less for it to feed upon . On the hills across the river , the ruddy light faded and they grew less distinct , less set off from the night beyond . The women watching began to feel the cold and wrapped their coats and their shawls more tightly around them , for as the fire lessened , it did less to rebuke the cold wind that swept down upon them from the icy skies . The men at the pails stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were clear on their ( aces . The fire was almost down to the ground and there as no good in further throwing water on the flames , even hough it might have helped before . They stood in the Ines , holding the empty pails in their hands , and stared at the fire , the frantic , mechanical motion of their arms as they passed the buckets up from the river to the fire and back again , stilled . Then every one heard the voice of Kalber , mad with fury , yelling at the men , but only Selma sniggered behind her glove because she saw in his dancing figure someingcomic while the others saw it as only tragic . He screamed at the men , " Vat-er , Gott demn it , more vat-er , t-er . Ach , Gott demn it , Gott demn it , " and jumping ore them with that futile , rageful cry , he began to pull the man who stood at the head of the lines , jerked at shoulders , so that his coat came half off his body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More vat-er ! " But now the line of men began to break up and half dozen surrounded Kalber and tried to show him howpI26 useless it was . Then his voice was stilled at last , and Lisa looked at the group around him mournfully , as did the little Elsie , but Selma turned away and said to herself , " Temper does n't get you anywhere . " Then Christian Kruger came up to them , his skin bright from the heat , his beard and eyebrows singed . He shook his head at Selma , dolefully . A thin coat of ice was forming on his clothes where water had spilled . Lisa said , " Elsie wants to go home , Selma . I 'll take her back now . " " Ah , Lisa . . . " Kruger began . " Ja , maybe you better , " Selma put in , and swiftly brought forth her hand to pat the child 's cheek . " Take her in bed with you , Lisa . " Now people were turning away from the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer to the wreckage of the butcher shop , close into the stench of burned meat and the thick clouds of smoke that poured up from dying flames . Selma looked at Kruger . " You look all worn out , " she said . " Gott , I am . Not as young as I used to be , I guess , " he said , and smiled at her wearily . " Your beard got burned , " she said . He shrugged his shoulders . " That 'll grow out again . Singeing 's good for hair . " Selma looked around her , then back at him . " This leaves us without a butcher shop , does n't it , Kruger ? " " Ja , " he answered , indifferent . " Kruger ... " He looked away from the fire , at her . " Kruger . . . " He smiled then . " I know what you 're going to say . " " Do you , Kruger ? Well , why not ? People are goingpI27to need meat , are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winter and part of the spring to get built up again . What are we going to do in the meantime ? Starve ? " Kruger smiled at her . It was the smile over the secret again , saying , Selma , Selma , we know , do n't we ? We know , do n't we , Selma ? But he said , " You are n't worried that anybody 's going to starve , Selma . " " No ? Well , you come in tomorrow , Kruger . I 've got business with you , " she said . " You 'll be easier to get along with than Kalber was , Selma , " he said . " Look , Kruger . I do n't know anything about meat . But you 've supplied butchers for years . You know what 's needed . You go ahead and plan to keep me supplied with about the same line that Kalber had , only a little smaller at first , maybe . I 'll have to build on , but there 's room at the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I need more space anyway . I 'll have a regular market , Kruger , big enough to keep everybody supplied . " " And when Kalber builds again ? " " Well , I guess the town 's big enough now to carry two butcher shops , is n't it ? " l le smiled again and she laughed back at him , pretending embarrassment . " Well , why not , Kruger ? " " Sure , why not , Selma ? Only it 's going to be hard on al her . " " Ach , we have to have meat , do n't we ? " " Sure , sure . " Then he laughed aloud . " You beat everything , Selma . You sure do . " " Ja " . " Poor old Kalber . " The fire was almost dead , and where it had been there as only a pile of charred beams glowing still , and thepI28 smoke still poured up from all the meat that had been destroyed . " I do n't like the smell , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The excitement 's over . " But before they turned to make their way back through the snowy streets , Kruger said , " Look at Kalber now , Selma . " He was sitting on the wet sidewalk where the snow had melted from the heat , sitting away from the thinning crowd and the wreckage of his shop . His rage was gone . He sat with his head buried in his hands , and though no sound came from his mouth , both Selma and Kruger knew that he was weeping , painfully and silently , knew how desolate his old face must look . They turned away , and Kruger shook his head , dolefully . " It 's hard on a man , " he said . Selma pulled her coat around her and began to hurry . It was very cold now . " When a man 's come to forty , and he 's still without a wife , he ought to begin to look around , Selma . " It was Christian Kruger talking , leaning back in a chair by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man has n't much business going on in life without a home , alone and friendless , after that , " he said , crossing his legs now and swinging one booted foot back and forth in the air . " Maybe he thinks he wants some other things , but a wife 's what he needs most then . " Selma smiled at him across the counter . She crossed her forearms on the top of the cash register and rested her chin on them , looking at the man , and then for a moment across the store to the new addition that she had built on , to Henry Schremmer standing in the window byp129the meat block , in front of the shelves that were laden with her new stock , groceries of every kind , and pyramids of cans from the new factory . She saw that Schremmer was not hearing , and as she looked at Kruger , she said , " You 're thinking of yourself , Kruger ? " He brought his tilted chair to the floor , got up to stretch out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where she stood leaning against the register . He hoisted himself up on the front of the counter and struck one boot with his riding crop . " All right  --  say I am . I 've worked hard all my life  --  too hard , I sometimes think , Selma , wondering if it 's worth it . Now I want a wife . I want children  --  or a son , at least . I 'm all alone in America , what relatives I have are back there in Germany , and not very close to me either . I want a son of my own . I 've got money  --  not enough , maybe  --  but a fair amount . Anyway , I do n't have to worry any more about having none . Well , I 've worked for it , all my life , ever since I was a boy coming from the old country without a word of English in my head . Now I want some one of my own blood to pass that on to . Now I want a wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have one . " Selma leaned back against the shelves behind her , ossing her arms over her chest , and she thought that now at last something was going to come out that she ad known before , something half-begun in his smile , an intention she had always read there but which he had not been ready to voice before ; but now it was coming out , he was going to finish the wish that the smile sheknew him by , the smile saying , We know , do n't we ? had only half-begun . So she said , " 7a , you 've worked hard , ill right  --  and perhaps too hard . You deserve something better than meals wherever you can pick them up and a little room in a hotel somewhere . You 've earned more than that , Kruger . " And she thought , Now he 'll talk , now he 'll finish the thing his smile has always just begun .. . Kruger smiled broadly at her then , the rough cheeks above his stiff black beard crackling into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old smile , the smile over the secret , but there was more than that in it , less of cunning and more of some kind of warmth for her . He said , " I like you , Selma . You 're something I 've never met before  --  a sensible woman that a man can talk to . " And his smile to her showed that fondness , and a kind of intimacy that he could feel for this woman who was something like himself . He leaned toward her now , across the counter , asking , with that smile , " Tell me , now , Selma , would I make a good husband ? " She leaned away from him a little , annoyed for a moment that he wasted time like this , that he did not come at once and without wasting words to the bargain . For they were two good business people , and she was a woman to whom men could talk and one who was used to it . So why did he waste time ? Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could think of for Lisa , who was young still and dreamy still and had that trip to Milwaukee behind her eyes and behind everything she did , still ; she needed some one like Christian Kruger , a man , strong and with a will , some one who could give her something else to think about , a home to make , a bed to get into , and children to have by him . It was some one like Kruger that she most needed , and once she had him , that look in her eyes would leave , and she would be living again , would be in the world again . Kruger was the man  --  hard-working , sensible , with a good head on his shoulders . But why did he waste words now , why did he not come to the bargain at once , and let words go ?  | " Are you debating it ? Is it such a problem ? " he asked , smiling still . She brushed her thoughts aside , said , " No , Kruger , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine husband , even a very fine one . I ca n't think of a better one , because you 've had to work , Kruger , all your life , and you know what life is  --  work  --  and what work is . You 're sensible , with a good head on your shoulders  --  sensible . Ja , Kruger , you 'd make a good enough husband . You 'd do ! " But the smile left his face suddenly , and he frowned , the black brows beetling . Then he strode heavily , abruptly away from her to the front of the store , there to look impatientlyout into the street , his back to her ; and , as she measured with her eyes the broad shoulders , the heavyms , the solid , stocky limbs , and the strong , flushed neck , came to Selma that he was desirable in many ways , in some ways that had nothing to do with money or the head on his shoulders . He was forty years old , perhaps a little older than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in town of a man with the strength of aung bull , and she remembered seeing him a year before a picnic , winning the cigars in every contest , rememberedbriefly the sight of him easily lifting a sledge hamerabove his head and bringing it down with a terrificblow on the stake , and the bell clanging at the top of thepost as if he had broken the whole contraption . He wasstrong , and in his strength there was something compelling , something strongly desirable , and though he wasperhaps no longer young , he was still young enough towant a young wife , and that was something . It would notbe hard for her to share a bed with him . It should not befor Lisa . From his place by the window he spoke to her . He that his breath struck her face . " What chance ? " he asked . said , " But a girl wants more than a sensible man who 's worked hard , more than just a man with a head on his shoulders , Selma . " She smiled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him he would not draw from her . He was proud and it was not good for a proud man to be told by a woman what his charms were . " And maybe that 's what I do n't have to give her , " he said . Once more he struck his booted calf with the leather crop , sharply , impatiently . She came to where he stood and with the same intimacy that he had shown her in his smile and in his voice a few moments before , she now smiled at him , laid a hand on his shoulder for a moment , reassuringly . " Kruger , when a man has as much as you 've got , he does n't have to worry about what he may lack . " He swung abruptly round to face her , and now he came to the point of the bargain , seeming suddenly tired of words himself . " Selma , " he said , " I want that girl . I want her more right now than anything else I can think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance ? " A smile came slowly over her face , almost cunningly , and then she turned and went leisurely away from him , back to her place by the counter , standing there , letting her fingers wander idly over the face of the cash register . She thought , Hmmm . . . it 's hot blood , is it ? . . . Forty years . . . well , that 's young in a man , I guess . . . She mused over the face of her cash register . But Kruger was insistent now . He came walking heavily back to her . He leaned close again , over the counter , soShe straightened , arched away from him , and smiled now frankly to him , more openly than ever before thatp133sly , secretive smile , that smile that said that there was between them some piece of knowledge that they alone were aware of . Then , almost alluringly , almost coyly , almost as if she were the young woman Lisa herself , she said , " That , Kruger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was not slow to answer . " When ? " " In these things , and with such a girl , it 's not good to waste time . You 've got to woo her quickly , abruptly , surprising her with your attack , so that she 'll be swept off her feet by your suddenness , swept out of that dream she lives in , and come into your arms , a woman ... She had spoken intently , almost passionately , and so now she laughed , deprecatingly , in embarrassment . " But this you know as well as I. " " Tonight ? " " Sure , tonight . In these things , with such a girl , the sooner the better . Tonight  --  sure . That 's better than tomorrow night , much better than the next . " Again she laughed . " I 'll come tonight , " he said , and then , as if he were annoyed by her laughter , as if he felt she was laughing at him , he turned quickly and strode to the front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Selma 's laughter turned to chuckling . e brought her hand to her mouth , and as her eyes rowed , chuckled to herself over the register . But when was out of sight , when she thought suddenly of Lisa , chuckling ceased , her lips set in their straight and min line , and she fell to musing again . Her fingers slid retlessly over the face of the cash register . When she had finished with the supper dishes , Lisa took Elsie 's hand , picked up the story book from the supper table , and came quickly with her into the darkened front room with her own book under her arm . She stopped by the fire and stirred up the flames while the child settled herself on the sofa , opening the book at the page where Lisa had stopped reading to her before supper . " Here 's the place , " the little girl said to herself . Lisa stood up from the fire and looked at her . " Ach , let 's not read any more tonight , Elsie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , Tante Lisa , you promised ! " Lisa sat down . " I know , Elsie , but T'ante 's tired . Let 's wait till tomorrow . Or you go on reading it yourself . " " It 's too hard , Tante Lisa . " Ach , it is n't , Elsie ! " " Ja , it is , I tried and I know it is ... " Lisa raised her eyes to the ceiling and though her arm was wound around the little girl 's neck and though in a moment her fingers began to run through the child 's thin , light brown hair , she thought of her no more . She held her book against her breasts , and , watching the fire , thinking of Selma , felt her heart pound against the book she held so close against her . Selma had been talking to her out there in the kitchen , and she could not bring her mind to reading to Elsie now because bits of Selma 's lecture stuck in Lisa 's mind , came flashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lisa , and it 's time you got married , but you need some one like him to take the dreaming out of your eyes . . . " " . . . he 's got money , he 's able to take care of you in the way you ought to be taken care of . . . " " . . . he 's not old . . . only forty . . . still handsome . . . and he 's got all the more important things ... " So remembering , her dark eyes widened , her lips fell a little apart , her breath died down , so that the bookp135she held against her breasts was motionless , and her whole body grew strangely calm with fright . Then Selma came into the room , slamming the door to the kitchen behind her . She stood over Lisa and Elsie as they sat on the sofa . " Elsie , " she said , " it 's time for you to go to bed . is going on eight , bedtime soon . " " Ach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice was a wail . Lisa looked up . " Just because he 's coming , Selma -- justbecause of that is no reason  --  " " Hush , Lisa ! Come on , now , Elsie . You can keep yourmp on and look at your book in bed for a while . " She walked around to the front of the couch and picked the girl up in her arms , then carried her to the stairs and her down , lit a lamp and took her hand . " Come on , ow , Elsie , like a good girl . I 'll go up with you . " Elsie looked up at her mother with damp eyes , butere was no more complaint from her , nor protest exceptc unshed tears in her eyes and a look of mute , habituated suffering behind them . Lisa waited on the couch , still hardly able to feel her breath . She stretched out then before the fire and looked up at the shadowy ceiling , and almost at once the cloud of dream sprang up in her face , veiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down into the room , nor did shee her standing behind the sofa until her voice came sudenly , startling her . " Lisa , " Selma said , " I 'm your sister . I'mn only working for your own good . You know that , do n't you , Lisa ? " Lisa turned on the sofa . Her voice rose thin and despairing . " I ca n't marry any one , Selma . Not any one at all . " Selma snorted in disgust and walked abruptly to the fire . Then she stood over Lisa , looking down at her with a kind of pitying scorn . " Dummes Kind , dummes Kind ! " she cried . " Gott , Kind , forget that . No one 'll ever know about it and you 'll ruin your life if you make yourself remember it all the time . What difference does it make ? You stepped wrong once . Well , what of it ? Do you think men are so pure ? Or women either ? Do n't you think that every day there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lisa , that 's so silly ! " Lisa had watched Selma as she spoke , but when she finished she turned her head away , facing the back of the sofa , wearily , and weary of the pain she felt and knew that she could never lose . " Well , Lisa , is n't it so ? Think , now ... " Lisa looked up at her again and raised her hand in a faint gesture of protest . Then she spoke again in her weary voice . " Selma , even if I felt that I could marry , it could n't be Kruger . He 's old to me , ugly . I 'd shudder every time he touched me . I do n't care what he 's got to give me , how much money  --  Did you think of money when you were young , when you first married ? Did you care about money then ? Did it seem such an important thing ? " Sharply , Selma drew in her breath . " I admit that . I always admit it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care as much . I admit it . And I was the fool , Lisa . Rememberthat . You know where it brought me , do n't you ? " " That does n't make it any different for me now . " Selma stared at her , angry . " You 're worse than I was anyway . Dreaming your life away , moping with a long face wherever you go , when you do go some place ! You read too many books , that 's what 's the trouble . It 's time you forgot books and started in to be a person , like other people . " She paused . Then , " Give me that , " and when Lisa made no movement , snatched the book from her .   " Selma , my book  --  " Lisa began , struggling up from the sofa . " Damn your book ! " Selma cried , angry beyond reason , outraged , and flung it across the room where it hit the all and fell into a corner . " You 're a fool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her again , weeping quietly now , with her face pressed into the back of the sofa . Then Selma 's face softened , her trembling anger drained away , d suddenly she sat down beside Lisa , and took her nd . She spoke to her , quietly , persuasively , almost derly . " You do n't remember Mama , Lisa , do you ? but I remember something  --  how sometimes I did n't ten to her . She never wanted me to  --  Ach , what does at matter now ? This matters , though , Lisa . I owe Mama erything I have and everything I can do for her I must . He made me promise that I 'd take care of you . I guessold enough now to know what 's good for a girl and at is n't . That 's why I care what happens to you , and now I 'm doing what Mama would want me to , and what 's right , Lisa . . . " isa turned restlessly on the sofa , drawing her hand out elma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tears , her sought the shadowy places of the ceiling again , and mind , lost in some remote maze of dream , wandering laces where Selma , even if she had wished , could not have followed , shut out Selma and the room , so while a sat there and talked on , urging her to be a woman use and to forget what she did not need to remember , heard nothing , and the fire burned low . They were tied by a sudden loud knocking on the outer door . " ' There he is , " Selma said . Lisa was on her feet , breathing heavily . " Do n't let him Tell him I 'm sick . Tell him I do n't want to marry him . him anything , but do n't let him in ! "   Then Selma looked at Lisa again with that look half of pity , half of scorn . " You tell him , " she said , and went out into the dark hall to open the street door . Lisa hesitated for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her breath fast and agitated , and then , as she heard the door open , as she heard the gruff voice of Christian Kruger greeting Selma , she turned quickly and fled to the stairs , and up . The sound of her hurried flight to the upper rooms came to Selma 's ears as she entered the room with Kruger . She said , " Give me your coat , Kruger , " and helped him out of it . Then she said , " Lisa  --  she 's timid , she 's young still , Kruger , and she 's a little afraid ... " " Where is she , Selma ? " " Upstairs . " " Well , call her . She 'll come down , wo n't she ? " Selma went to the stairs . She called , softly at first , then more urgently , more sharply . But there was no answer . She thought again that Lisa was a fool , but she said to Kruger as she turned to him , " She 's young still , Kruger ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried . " Why time ? I 've never had to wait for anything I 've wanted . I 'm not used to waiting . I make it mine  --  on the spot . " His voice was loud . Selma spoke quietly . " But now you 're not  --  now you 're dealing with a young woman , Kruger , a tender one  --  not with farmers or your cattle ! " She sat down on the sofa , but Kruger stood before the fire , his figure huge and dark , looming up before her . He stood with his feet apart , so that the solid , somewhat stocky legs slanted up to his torso , with his body erect , his hands clasped behind his back , and Selma caught herself thinking again that he was strong , not old yet , and rich , in so many ways , so rich .. . P139But Kruger was angry , perhaps because he was not used to wooing and knew that it was not his strength , rather than because he wanted Lisa so badly and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , and he said suddenly , " The devil with her ! The women I know are n't so foolish . They 're women ! " Selma smiled . " But you do n't want to marry those women , do you , Kruger ? The women you know ? " " Pahl " he cried . " I do n't know why I want to marry any one ! " " You want to marry because you 're a man , Kruger . And Lisa is the woman that your manhood wants to have . You can have her , too , Kruger . But you have to remember some things . You have to remember that she 's young still and afraid and not used to this . You have to give her time , I guess . . . " There was some syrup in her words , some sweetening , ftening quality that took the red anger from his faced the loud indignant note from his voice . He said , " Ja , Selma , I guess you 're right . Most of the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back . But you work for me until 1 do . " Selma smiled , said , " 7a , ja , Kruger , I 'll work for you all right . " After he was gone , Selma came back and lay down onthe sofa . She lay there and thought that perhaps she was giving too much of her mind to Christian Kruger , too much of her thought , but that did nothing to take him from her mind , for in a moment she was lost in a reverie that wound itself around the solid facts of his life , around the solid achievement . She tried to picture him as a boy , coming alone from Bavaria like her father , without a word of English in his head , and with no money in his pocket ; tried to see him tramping his way west , getting rides as best he could on trains and in wagons along country roads , and that not so hard because he owned no baggage to carry with him , and getting to Minnesota finally , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man who got a farm for himself , and built it up , built great barns and a little house only as large as it had to be , and living in that , selling that farm at a good profit and going into stock buying , until now , at forty , he was a wealthy man , a wise cattleman , riding from town to town , from farm to farm , dashing about over the outlying hills and the prairie on his fine black horse , striking bargains and deals , always coming off on the top , a little ahead of the man he dealt with . Now , at forty , twenty-five years after he had come as an ignorant German boy without a family , without money enough to ride on a train from New York to Minneapolis , he was known as the shrewdest business man in the county , as one of the shrewdest in that whole part of the State . Selma was not cold to that life . It was the life of her father over again , filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . What he had done she knew was achievement , and so , her life in its last ten years was something of an achievement , for out of the wreckage in which Charlie Verkle had left her home and her business , she had built up something strong , something substantial , so that now her store was one of the best in the county , and she was one of the wealthiest persons in the town . That she had done . She was known as a smart woman , as one who , like Kruger , could swing almost any business deal and swing it so that she came out a little ahead of the man with whom she dealt . She was known in the town and through the prairie around it for that quality , known , too ( though what of that ? ) as something of a miser , as one who , by close economy , P141had made her way to affluence , as one who knew the value of the dollar because she knew first the value of the penny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not matter . So , she found herself weaving her life into the thought web of Christian Kruger 's , twisting the strands of the one into the maze of the other , intermingling , entwining , uniting , weaving swiftly together the separate strands in her mind . Christian Kruger had much to give a woman , and she knew that Lisa would have none of it , now or later . He would persist for a while , for a little while , but Lisa would have none of it and nothing of him , for Lisa was a fool , a silly little fool . She could hear now through the ceiling the low tones of Lisa 's voice as she read to Elsie , and she could picture in her mind Lisa in bed with Elsie , her arm around her and their heads close , reading to the child , and wrapping her in all that warm , lush love that she denied herself at every other time , for any one else . Lisa was twenty-seven , and yet in every way she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every way except that she had shut herself off , shut herselfapart from the world in her vague dreaming ; but otherwise  --  the same , with the same girlish face , the same soft and trembling mouth , the same soft eyes . And like a child still was her behavior , like a silly girl still all hertions and all her thoughts . But Selma had done her duty by her . From now on it was Lisa 's own affair , and if she would not have him ( as she would not ) that , too , was her affair . She sat up suddenly and stared into the dying coals of the fire , crumbling into ashes , and she smiled her slow smile of cunning then as she thought , I 've done all I can for her . Now . . . well ... maybe ... maybe I 'll get him myself . . . Who knows ?  | MACHINERY made a difference , helped in this forgetting life . In the summer of 1900 the editor of the newspaper recorded a hayrack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how such parties were unfamiliar to the city folk and how delighted they were with them . Surely ( he wrote ) it is much more amusing to drive out into the country in a hayrack than to go to a picnic in a large city on an electric Strassenbahn , for it is not only a much cheaper diversion , but it affords conversation between friendly persons  --  a much more pleasant thing than mingling with strangers in the great unfriendlybustle of a large city . And yet it seemed that it was the ambition of the village to become as much like a city as It could , mimicking wherever it might , importing machinery if necessary to make possible this mimickry . In the first year of the new century some strangers came to the town and set up a tent on an empty lot at the edge of the village in which they showed so-called " moving " pictures of the Spanish-American War , and while you could tell that the pictures were not real , that they were taken against painted stage drops , this new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while watching the pictures , had a sharp feeling that the world was rapidly changing into a wonderful , an almost fabulous place , and that they , in Sacton , were beginning to play a part in that world . This feeling was  --  of lessened when a year later a cement mixer was brought to the town from the city , and sidewalks of cement were laid on Water Street in place of the old board walks , and it was then that the village board decided to lay no more wooden walks , but as the old ones fell to pieces to replace them with cement. his involved the cutting of many trees which had grown up  |p146since  the earlier years , so that once more the village had in places something of that naked look of its founding times . So long before as 1886 the town had looked forward to the time when it would have electric lights , so that there could be a lighthouse for river traffic . Now , in 1902 , the river was a shallow stream filled with sandbars , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient roots of trees showing through their banks , so that a lighthouse was no longer necessary , the only boats on the river being two small vessels with gas engines , owned by village youths who spent their time scuttling up and down the river under the bridge , and back and forth from shore to shore , filling the village with queer , explosive sounds . But then transformers were brought in on the train , and a brick building was put up to house the village power plant ; the old kerosene lamp-posts were pulled down and six great arc lights were strung across Water Street at regular intervals , with smaller incandescent lights at the intersections of less importantthoroughfares . Many business establishments installed the new lights and even some of the more extravagant residents , but the editor complained nonetheless that there were many people who could afford to have electric lights in their homes who had not installed them , that such an attitude would never make of Sacton a really progressive place . But how progressive it was you could judge from the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been seen on the prairie before , caused a whole span of the bridge , built in earlier times , to crash down into the river under its weight when an industrious farmer who had hoped to rent his machine from farm to farm attempted to bring it across the river . Now automobiles began to come , too . In 1904 , some friends of the Governor of the state presented him one of the new machines so that he would be able to increase the number of his personal campaign speeches , and while the village had small respect for the Governor , with his radical ideas , his meddling with the railroads and corporations , his criticism of the whole development of that economic and political life in AmericaP147which had given them such safety , the whole population turned out on the day he gave his campaign speech from his new automobile , for they had read in the papers about this vehicle , read how in Oshkosh the Governor 's chauffeur had been arrestedand fined for crossing a street at a speed greater than four miles an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Missed . But at the speech there was no acclaim for the speaker or for his message except from one old man , one of the oldsettlers , a forty-eighter who , unlike most of the others , had not thrived in Sacton , but now , in his old years , suffered from both poverty and a weak heart . After the Governor 's speech e was wildly excited and rushed up to the automobile to conatulatethe candidate , and when he came there his heart - euld no longer bear the agitation of his spirit and the greatnesshis enthusiasm , and he fell dead before the candidate of theovement called Progressivism . It was a strange thing to hapbutit was most strange that even one old man in the town should have died that way , old men , like the world andthe town , having changed so since forty-eight . The old man waslonely one , without a wife or children , and there were few remember how he died , and with all the new things in aworld that was moving with such speed , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and easy to forget . People had money , and for some years there had been talkforming a bank , but it was only a tragedy that brought thebank in the end . For many years a wealthy lawyer in the village , Franz Kahl , had acted as financial guide to most of the people in town , had , for a reasonable sum , advised them of soundvestments , and , very frequently , had paid them interest forit money and invested it himself . This arrangement seemedtisfactory enough until the day when the rumor sprang upthe had lost a good deal of money , that he must declareself bankrupt , and , in another day or two , when this happened , he was not able to give back one penny to the angry , ruined people who , in those two days , came clamoring for theirmoney . But the old man himself seemed not to have suffered much , and though he had declared his bankruptcy , settled down now in his home to a quiet , comfortable life and did not seem to mind much the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor the flight of his son , likewise named Franz , who disappeared in the night , unwilling to live on in the town where he would forever be reminded of his father 's shame . At first there was no news of him , but later in the decade , rumors began to come back telling vaguely of his success in business in some distant , eastern city , and still later the villagerswould now and again come across his name in the newspapers , the name of a man whose greatness was growing , who called himself , now , Francis L. Kahl . No one remembered that his grandfather was a Hungarian named Franz Kahlansz who had come to the site of the town long before with a man who walked in dream and whose name , too , was shortly lost . It was the tragedy of old Kahl 's failure which caused the founding of the bank . It was housed for several years in a small wooden building which had once been the tobacconist 's shop , and that small frame building with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety that had grown with all the changes of the years , and some few were able to forget the money they had lost in the lawyer 's bankruptcy . Before the end of the decade , the village declared an official homecoming , a week , set apart from the rest of the summer , in which all the people who had ever lived in the village , all the sons who had gone out into the world , to the cities , to seek and make their fortunes , should return and see what had been made of their native place . It was a gala affair , with speeches and street parades in which there were several automobiles , owned by men in the village , and parades on the river , too , in the boats which the villagers owned , and from which all kinds of fireworks were set off , lighting up the whole landscape , the rockets shooting away over the hills in a stream of fire celebratingchange and a return to a home almost unrecognizable for its improvements . But change was forgetting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bluff in the chain of the hills , therep149was no one to remember that man long dead who had stood there once with an idle dream of a moneyless brotherhood in his head , and there was no one left to strain his eyes toward the hills in an effort to see there now his grieving ghost . Ghosts were death and ancient danger , but this homecoming , filling the village with returned sons , celebrating progress , was life , the life desired . By 1909 there were so many automobiles in the village that it became imperative to build a garage , as some astute villager shortly did , and people began to wonder how long it would be before the old livery stable would be transformed into another . One garage was fine in itself , but two garages would frighten forever any ghost of old remembering , and the queer , explosive sounds of machines would drown out any threat of senseless rief . HE lifted her eyes from the columned pages of theheavy book on the table and looked toward thekitchen door . " Lisa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her voice , harsh in the silence , faded into faintness in the cold room , and died . The door opened and Lisa came in . " Did you call ? " c asked . In the momentary silence between Lisa 's question and Selma 's reply , the sisters looked at each other , Lisa inquiringly and with vague preoccupation in here , Selma almost curiously , with some sudden interest . Then Selma said , " Get the lamp , Lisa . " She said it softly , with a strange note of tenderness in her voice ; and added , and light the fire , " as Lisa disappeared into the kitchen min . Then , as the sound of her activity in the pantryl me through the open kitchen door , as Selma 's frankarc toward the doorway changed to something else , tosomething soft and almost tender and regretful , and her steel gray eyes dulled for a moment , she thought , In that moment , as she stood in the door ... But how strange ! It was myself I saw there for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though she were suddenly out of herself and ten years back , or even fifteen , for Lisa stayed so young ... And she had once been like thatred-cheeked , handsome , her hair combed up in a proud and careful way , and her bosom high , though never so full . She had been that way , and now , in these years , that past was dead , so forgotten that when Lisa suddenly appeared in the door and thrust her so suddenly back into a time fifteen years before , she had been surprised into silence , forgetting for a moment to answer . . . how strange ! And how strange it made her feel , inside , soft suddenly and warm , all the thin hardness gone out of her for a moment , and not back yet , as she sat there staring at the door and swept back into that earlier time , her whole being bathed in a faint tenderness that came from that other time and that blurred for her now the present and the darkening room in which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dispelled a little that warmth and softness in her , and thought that it was time that did it , passing , changing people , for the better or for the worse , but always moving and taking people along in its stream , so that never anything was quite the same but always changing , getting better or worse . She took the gold-rimmed spectacles from her nose and laid them on the open account book before her on the table . She rubbed her eyes and thought that the spectacles were only part of that eternal changing , only part of the growth and decay , the endless altering of the present into the past and the leaving of something different , which , in another moment , would itself be changed.  |p151In  the fading light of the room , her face was gray , thin , and her hair , which she wore pulled back straightand tight , which seemed thinner than it had ever beenbefore , was almost colorless , a sort of brown faded intodun , into a not quite gray there in the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper , were thin , coarsened and rough with work , but strong looking still . And then , as she took her eyes away from the door andlooked at her hands , she thought that even so , in spite ofall the changes she had known , she was not old yetforty , forty-one  --  what was that ? If she was no longerlike Lisa , if the soft bloom of youth had long since decayed to the gray pallor of her hands in the dusk , her strengthand not decayed and she could still think of herself as mething hard and swift . Lisa 's bloom , all that Lisa od for , was what she had most willingly given away , town away , because she knew how little it was worth , w it could deceive and soften and bring ruin with it . t strength is what she had , and it was something on hich she knew that she could forever rely . But she sighed little , moving her chapped hands restlessly on the white gc , sighed with some vague discontent that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenderness in hich she had melted so surprisingly a moment before , nil it was only when she thought of Christian Kruger suddenly that she forgot her sigh and the vague thingm which it arose . Then she was thinking of Kruger and , in three years , his hot blood had cooled a little , howhad given Lisa up , or seemed to ; at least , no longer , itseemed , wanting her or what she could give him . Andshe thought , he , too , would rather have strengththan beauty or youth . Lisa came back into the room , bearing the lighted lamp , holding it high , so that her face glowed in the golden flood of its light . She put it on the table by Selma 's books , saying , " I trimmed the wick a little . I think it burns better now . " " Danke , Lisa . " She watched her go to the grate then , come down to her knees , crumple up a newspaper and arrange slivers of kindling on it , and then put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She watched her strike a match on the bricks , and touch the little redyellowflame to the paper , and as the large flames sprang brightly up , watched her face turn ruddy in the glow . Then her mind suddenly jumped back again , went to that time when she had stirred a fire and Charlie Verkle , her lover , had watched from the sofa ; and even then , she thought , she had been the stronger  --  even then , when she loved him , the only man she had ever loved like that , with such tenderness and warmth , her love had been mixed with assurance , with strength of will , with strength of pride , and she had married him thinking herself strong enough to change him . Now , with Lisa bending over the flames as they began to lap the obdurate wood , her hair golden in the light , Selma remembered when she had knelt there by her lover , stirring up a fire for him , loving him with that strange tenderness and warmth , lost and alien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Is he coming again tonight ? " Lisa asked , looking abruptly away from the fire to Selma at the table . a . " Then I 'm going out . " " All right , " Selma said , stiffening , feigning indifference ; but she felt that Lisa had challenged her and some of her body 's stiffening went into the tone of her voice when she said , " Lisa , I think we 're going to get married . "  |p153Lisa  rose slowly from her knees and came to the table where her sister was . She sat down across from her , the lamp between them , and said , tensely , " Ach , I knew it ! " A pause ; then , " Oh , Selma , you ca n't ! " Selma looked up from the account book , from her handsspread out over the white , figured page . " Ca n't ? No ? " Lisa 's voice went low and now it pleaded with a soft thos in it : " Oh , Selma , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please . . . " And changed again , sharpened ddenly with repressed nausea : " That man here , living ' th us , your husband ... in this house ! Oh , no , Selma ! " " Why not ? What 's wrong with that ? " " Do n't you know what 's wrong with it ? Do n't you feel at something is ? " Selma shrugged her thin shoulders . " No . You 're silly , " Selma , I 'm not silly ! I ca n't let you . It 's . . . it 's terrible ! Think of Elsie , if you wo n't think of me , or of yourself ! " " Elsie ? Maybe I am thinking of her . " " Ach , that 's it , then . Then what everybody says is gilt . But you are n't thinking of her if it 's only his money you 're after . " Selma reared up suddenly in her chair . " Who says it 's money I 'm after ? " But before Lisa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lips , Selma relaxedsmiled quietly to herself , cunningly , and said , ell , Lisa , even if that 's true , what of it ? " . isa stood up and looked down at Selma for a moment then turned away , walked to the fire and stared downthe flames . Then , wearily , a little sadly , she spoke in . " You were n't always like this ... " ere was a silence in which only the fire spoke .   Then Selma looked at Lisa again , and asked sharply , with that old hint of pity and scorn , " Like what ? " " Like this . . . You know what I mean . " " No , I do n't know . " Lisa sighed by the fire . Then she looked at Selma and said , " When I was little , you were so nice , so pleasant , gay even . . . " She spoke with difficulty , her soft voice broken with a jerky embarrassment . Then , as if to cover her difficulty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Selma 's chair , put her head in her lap , and then went on . " When I was little , Selma , you used to take me in your lap there on the sofa and sing ... old German songs , sometimes love songs ... one was called Heimweh ... Do you remember ? Wenn in die Ferne vom Felsen ich seh ' ... And often one called Kennst du das Land ... You used to sing me to sleep when I was real little , and later you played on the organ and sang to me there , or let me sing . . . But now it 's different , now everything is changed , and you want to change it still more . Now you do n't care about that old life any more , about comfort and pleasure . . . not even affection . " Selma smiled down at Lisa 's head , but as the younger woman went on speaking , the smile faded , and now the melody of one of those songs came back into her head , and then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years , the words . . . Kennst du das Land wo die Citronen bluhn .. . But what came then , what after that ? Her mind reached back , back , over that distance , through all that time , dreamily strained back for the words , the words ... " ... wo die Citronen bluhn ... " What after that , whatp155words , what after that ? " . . . Gold-Orangen gluhn ... " " .. . gliihn ... " " ... gluhn ... " And then suddenly her mind was back there , and had the words : Kennst du das Land wo die Citronen bluhn , lm dunkeln Laub die Gold-Orangen gliuhn ? Ein sanfter Wind vom blauen Himmel went , Die Myrte still , and hock der Lorbeer steht  --  Kennst du es wohl ? Dahin ! DahinMocht ' ich mit dir , o mein Geliebter , ziehn ! But oh ! how long ago ! So long ago , so many years ago , that she could hardly see herself singing it , could only faintly feel what that song must once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that softening tenderness for Lisa that she had felt before . She laid her hand on her head , stroked her hair absently , almost tenderly .. . She thought vaguely that for the first time since thatfight when Lisa had come back from Milwaukee had sheroken through that shell , was Lisa again the old Lisa , thewarm and friendly , the knowable . If she could go on likethis , being her old self again , it would be nice , it would bepleasant . If they could be together like this oftener , feelingsomething for each other , something different from thetrangeness that stood between them , it would be pleasant. en Lisa would have freed herself at last from the dreaminess , that aloneness in which she was always wrapped , uld seem to see people again instead of looking throughd beyond them , would love people again , would be old self once more  --  gay , loving others than just Elsie .. . But then it was Lisa who dispelled the tenderness , Selma , for suddenly Lisa looked up and Selma could seee tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were angry now , impatient , as she cried , " Now it 's only money ! All the time ! That 's all you think of ! Money , money , money ! You let the house fall to pieces , let the whole town talk about us , let everything else go . Alwaysskimping , trying to save on everything , never thinking of anything else , you ... " Selma was sitting back in her chair , stiffly , her face grayer suddenly , older , and more stern , but with something proud in it , something that was steel against the return of the tenderness she had been feeling only a moment before . Lisa stared at her and then , more softly , said , " Ach , Selma , I 'm sorry . But it 's almost that bad . And once you were different , I can remember ... " Selma 's voice feigned tolerance , but her annoyance crept through its feigning when she said , " Lisa , when you were eighteen , when you were a young and giddy girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But you are n't a girl any more and you ought to know what that kind of stuff brings you to . You 're thirty now , and it 's about time you were getting over the notions that your head 's always full of . " " Notions ! " Lisa cried with sudden fierceness , her face flushing , her cheeks a deeper red . " Did you ever stop to think what you 're going to do with all your money once you 've got enough ! " She stood up . " Did you ? " Selma folded her arms and leaned back in her chair . " Enough ? You 'll always be a fool , I guess . " But before Selma had finished , Lisa had turned away and was at the door . Then she stopped and looked back over her shoulder . " In this town , " she said , " I 'd be ashamed to marry him ! " When the door was closed behind Lisa , Selma took up her spectacles again and then her pen . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , and did not raise her head except once to look at the closed doors ofp157the parlor , to see through them to the old organ beyond , untouched by her for many years . Then she thought that now that Elsie was beginning to play ( and well , too , for the few lessons she had had ) , it was possible that Kruger would buy her a piano . But that could come later . Now it was Lisa who had to be tended to , kept quiet , kept out of this so that it would not be spoiled . Ashamed ! she thought suddenly , and then , impatiently , Ach , the fool ! When Christian Kruger came after supper , the account hooks were still open on the table under the lamp , and though there was fresh wood on the fire , the room did not seem changed . But Lisa had gone as she had promised ( and It was best that she was gone ) and Elsie had been anxious enough to stay all night with little Adele Kahl when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the room and helped him take off his coat , Selma knew that she would have no interference in her plan , and that they would not be interrupted . Kruger 's eyes wandered over the pages of the account book , and he smiled in his beard with approval and pleasure . " Working on Sunday , Selma ? " he asked . " I guess I 'm always working , Christian . Sunday 's like any other day to me . And now , at the end of the year , there 's more work than ever . " They sat down before the fire , side by side , and Kruger ed then , " Has the old year been good to you ? " " Very good . Better than any I 've ever had . " " With me , too . . . These are prosperous times . " Selma rubbed her hands together before the blaze . " Give e a few more years and I 'll be rich , " she said , smiling toelf , and then , turning a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Selma  --  the richest woman I know . " P158He smiled , too , and in his smile and speech , as in hers , there was again that sly admission of a secret between them , but now , they knew , the secret was a little changed . He folded his arms on his chest and leaned back on the sofa , seemed to expand in pride and comfort and in the good feeling of satisfaction as he said , " I 'm rich too , Selma . " There was a pause , a long pause filled with an insistent , awkward silence . They were two good business people , but now there was something standing between them , something that kept them from coming immediately to the bargain , to the actual transaction , the actual admission of their secret knowledge . Finally , wanting to push this thing aside , he said , " We 're much alike , Selma  --  you and I. " She looked at him and said boldly , " What are you thinkingnow , Christian ? " And as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between them , keeping them apart , keeping them from the point of their bargain , he said , " I 'm thinkingnow , Selma , that it 's you and I who ought to get married . " It was enough to release both of them from the awkwardnessthey had felt , from the slight embarrassment , and , drawn together now , she said , " You want what I can give you ? Do you know how much it is ? " He smiled . " I guess I know enough , Selma , to know that I want you . And I guess you know about how much I 've got for you . I guess we 'd both be satisfied . " Then she said something , her voice dropped very low , and then he spoke , in the same low tones , their voices suddenlyconfidential , their conversation turned now to businessand money and the investment of capital and the financial arrangements that must prelude their marriage . P159They talked thus fora long time , Kruger bent forwardtoward her , she leaning toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resting on the projection of her knees . en at last the intent expression on their faces softened , r both now were certain they they were satisfied , and as ruger stood up , he said , " It 's plain , is n't it , Selma , how rong we could be if we threw it all together , and how we uld make it grow ? " She arose to stand beside him before the fire , said , " I 'll arry you , Christian , " and then , with the secret admitted at last , they smiled at each other no more . Kruger sat down again , his forehead clouded again , and said , " There 's only one other thing , Selma ... a . " I want a son . I want some one to go on from where I leave off . I do n't want to think that my life is just a beginningand an end , something alone and separate from what was before and what 's to come after . I want to be a begining , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want some one to give my life to as a start , andy money , some one of my blood . " She looked down at him and saw that his hair was grizng , saw that his beard was now a little grizzled , with fine y streaks in it , and as she stared down at his head , she itated to answer for a moment , seemed almost to waver her resolve . But her eyes narrowed a little and the lines iking down from her forehead deepened , and she was inking suddenly of some common tricks of her trade . She as thinking that to advertise her linen as second stock ould be bad business , as it would be bad business to tellcustomers every time that her eggs were not fresh , or lower the price on them because they were not when st of her trade would never know the difference . Think/ing this , she thought further that now it would be very bad business indeed to tell Kruger that a child was the one gift that she could never bring him  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all that money .. . Her eyes opened wide once more , and she said deliberately , evenly , " I 'd like a son , too , Christian . A son is different from a daughter , a son is what I want now , too . You do n't have to worry about that . " But she thought that in time , as he gave up the hope of a son of his own ( and he could never blame her for that ! ) he would come to love Elsie instead , and in time Elsie would be as much to him as a son could be , and then it would be Elsie to whom the money would go , her blood , not his .. . Kruger looked up and in that moment almost loved her . The bright twinkle in his eyes was happy , alert and affectionate , almost loving , so pleased was he now with the success of his wooing . He said , " Ach , Selma , there is n't another woman in the world as sensible as you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled at him , pleasure in her smile too , until he said , " Come here , Selma . Sit by me . " But then her smile changed almost to a pout and she held back from him , caressing the bricks of the fireplace at her back . She said , " There 's another thing yet , Christian . I 'm not young . I 'm forty-one now ... " " I 'm more than that . " " Ja , but in a man it 's different . I 'm not handsome any more , I 'm not young . Once I was like Lisa , but not any more . It 's only that I 'm afraid you wo n't be satisfied with me , that you 'll want younger women ... " " Ach , Selma ! You 're all right , do n't worry about that . You 're the kind of wife I want . Three years ago , even two years , I guess , I thought I wanted a young woman , but now I know better , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can have you , and now it 's you I want , Selma . Come here and sit by me . " She smiled again , the thin bloodless lips curving . She said , " I 'm glad , Christian . I 've loved you longer than you know , even when I worked for you with Lisa , even then already I loved you ... " He got up and took her in his arms . He said , " We are n't so old . . . " and then he kissed her , holding her in his arms tightly , as if she were a young girl and he a hot young lover . " No , we 're not so old , " he said again , leading her back to the sofa , laughing in his grizzling beard , all his embarrassment gone now before his desire . " Not too old , anyway . " She lay back in his arms on the sofa , caressing with her rough hand his bearded cheek , and he bent quickly to kiss her again on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belated return of passion in her strong though aging body , a passion that she had not felt for many years , a kind of mad sickness of the flesh that ached and groaned for slaking , she tightened her arms around him , her heart beating heavily under her flat breasts , her limbs tightly interlaced with his . And so the arithmetical computations with which her mind had been filled that whole afternoon and all that evening while she talked with Kruger , went now , drivenway by the mad desire for a man 's body which she was suddenly , remarkably feeling . And her breasts lifted and jell quickly under his rough caress as she let her mind anddy give way completely to the insistence of this desired the stubby fingers of Christian Kruger fumbling ate clasps of her worn garment and coming into sudden , exciting contact with her unlovely flesh . But this could not last . When he left her she felt weak d old , tired and weary beyond her years , neither young nor strong nor passionate . But she had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhausted , nor to rt . pent , could she , for when he left , though she lay back on tile sofa harried and weak , she was adding figures in her mind again , adding together the sum of his fortune and her own , adding together and estimating the sum of their strength . But even then she did not think of him or of his power , for once more the bargain had been swung her way , by a littlr deception she had won her point and lost him his . To this she gave her thought . For without the son he so much wanted ( to leave the whole sum to , to leave his own pride and strength to ) , there was nothing in the bargain for him . This she knew , and over this she chuckled feebly now as she felt her strength return , seep up through her veins again , as she lay sprawled and dishevelled on the worn sofa before the neglected fire that had by now gone out . For a long time now Lisa had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , and her way different , too . Now she seemed much more removed from the world and from people than ever before , but it was a different kind of removalfrom that in which she used to live , not only the soft vagueness and dreaming of before , but a kind of hard , glassed-in indifference , a shell through which no pain reached , nor any pleasure , either . With Selma she was almost always silent , seeming to hide behind her face , and by her face shutting intrusion and affection out , keeping behind it some bitter , hating thing that never spoke . In the store she worked methodically , without talking unless she needed to , and at home , too , she went through the routine of housework with a kind of mechanical unfeelingness . Itp163only with Elsie that she was herself , or with some stray animal that she had found and brought in , and this habit c had taken to more and more , ever since she first seemed change after that evening when she pled with Selma not marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were going to be married , that everything was settled . at once she had retreated into that glassy indifference - that kept her completely from the world , and it was y when she thought that Selma was not noticing her t she came out of it , and then only with Elsie , as she to her or sometimes sang with her at the new piano ( a e square one , half-filling the parlor ) that Kruger had ' light , and with the cats and dogs that she brought in , as e bathed them or nursed them with all the care and tenderness that a mother lavishes on her child  --  these wing then in her face and in her hands . It had been that way for almost a year , so that now , on wedding day , Selma was not surprised at the way she d or the queer way she looked . But it was a nuisance , she suddenly flung down her pen , so that the ink splattered over the newly addressed envelope of one of the announcements that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jumped up from the table where had been writing . A nuisance , and she had had enough ! She stood by the window , biting her lip . She looked it 'd the river , easy to see now with so many trees cut for the wide new sidewalk , but she turned away quickly and went out into the kitchen where Mrs. Mueller working over the stove . " Where 's Lisa ? " she asked . " I do n't know . She went out quite a while ago with " Maybe she 's outside . " " Maybe . " Then she went out on to the back porch and down into the garden , and she looked out under the trees , where the leaves were beginning to fall , but saw no one , until , under one of the grape arbors , she saw a flash of white . She walked further , peering in under the still heavily leaved arch of vines , and then she saw them at the further end , Lisa sitting on the ground with Elsie on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would not hear or see her , and stopped behind them , screened safely by the large grape leaves . She stood there for a moment , listening , and heard Lisa 's voice talking , very low , very soft , filled with a tenderness which Selma had not been allowed to hear for many months. " . . . different , Elsie , " her voice was saying . " I could n't do anything if I did go away , so it would n't help , or matter . But you 'll go . You 'll finish school and with my money you 'll go away to school after that , where you can study music if you want to , because I know you have talent for it . Alreadyyou can play the piano very well , though you 've had it for only a few months , and some day you 'll be a great woman , with an education , living out in the world , with kindly people who know gaiety and love laughter .. . You 'll get out of all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal Selma darted around the edge of the arbor and confronted them , and as she suddenly broke in on the dream which Lisa had been spinning around them , Elsie jumped up , frightened and ashamed , crying , " Mama ! " Lisa sat still on the ground , her face masked at once by that closed look of hers , but without either fright or shame . She stared at Selma . " Get in the house , Elsie , " Selma said , controlling her voice with an effort.  |p165Lisa  took the girl 's arm but kept her cold eyes on Selma . " She does n't have to go , " she said . Elsie 's fright showed in her face , and in her body strainingagainst Lisa 's hand clutched on her arm . Her eyes could not face her mother 's , but shifted back and forth , as if she were guilty of a sin , as if she feared that unless she went away quickly she would be punished for it . " Then she pulled her arm loose and turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the porch . " So that 's what you 're up to now , is it ? " Selma asked . " What ? " Lisa 's face was blank , empty of understanding . " Working on her now , because you ca n't work on me and ca n't do anything for yourself . " Absently , Lisa 's hand moved back and forth over the ground , stroking the dying grass . She watched her hand move back and forth . Then Selma spoke again . " I 'm sick of the way you 've been acting Lisa . It 's all right when you do n't mix up in my business , I do n't care then what you do or how foolish you act . But now it 's different . Who I marry does n't concern you and if you do n't like it , keep out of it . Already you 've caused me trouble with your stubbornness . We could have got everything for this wedding ready by ourselves , the cooking and all , but no , then you have to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , so that at the last minute I have to get in Mrs. Mueller to do the cooking and the cleaning . It 's a silly waste that did n't need to be . I have n't got money to throw away ! But worse than that , you ca n't keep your hands off Elsie , or your talk away from her , and start trying to put ideas in her head . Well , it 's got to stop ! " Lisa looked up casually , without expression in her face ,  | and then looked back down at her hand still stroking the grass , back and forth , monotonously , back and forth .. . " You understand that ? " There was no answer . " Lisa , I 'm talking to you ! " Selma cried . Lisa looked up again and then down . Selma sighed . " Well , go on in and get dressed , anyway . There wo n't be much time after dinner . " Lisa looked up once more . " Dressed ? Why should I get dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old gingham housedress , faded and worn , ill-fitting , even soiled . It was the kind of dress that Lisa wore all the time now , her interest in clothes , in her appearance , almost entirely gone . Selma cried out in exasperation : " Why should you get dressed ? Because you 're going to stand up for me this afternoon , and you ca n't do it in that old rag . " Lisa smiled as if to herself . " I 'm not going to stand up for you . I never said I would . " She spoke very quietly . Selma 's face went red with anger . " All right , " she said , " I expected that . Stay away then , I can get some one else . Milly Werner or a half dozen others will be only too glad to do it for me . But then you stay away , you hear ! I 'll tell them you 're sick . And remember this , too  --  stay away from Elsie and mind your own business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Lisa said , as quietly as she had spoken before . " No ? " Selma hardly took that seriously . Lisa stood up , and then , for the first time in months , that hard and brittle shell in which she seemed to live fell from her , and her face , suddenly white with feeling , showed how much she had kept hidden behind it . " No , " she cried . " She is n't ! She 's more ashamed of you than I am , than I could ever be , because she 's your daughter , and I 'm onlyp167your sister . She 's only thirteen , but even now she knows how shameful your marriage is , and how scandalous , how small your life ! She hates Kruger , hates him more than I do , and with better reason , and the longer you live with him , the more she 'll hate him , and you , and your money , and all the foul life you 've given her . She wo n't be there today if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Selma stepped away . " She 'll be there , " she said . " And she 'll play , too , just like I 've planned  --  every bit of it ! " They stared at each other long and bitterly , their eyes ensnared . Then Selma turned away from Lisa suddenly , from the furious hate that leapt from her eyes , from the suffering of her mouth . And after dinner , when the small wedding party gathered in the parlor , Elsie was at the piano . She sat before the large instrument , heavy and bulky in the room , with her head bent over the keys , playing softly at Selma 's order while the few guests assembled . There were only eight people there , a few of Kruger 's friends and a few of the women whom Selma had once known intimately , invited now as a proud gesture , to say that in her marriage there was nothing shameful . Elsie , pale and inconspicuous in spite of her new dress , sat by the piano with her head bent over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother did not feel . There was something pitiable about the arch of her neck , the submission in its pose , something pitiable in the slope of her thin shoulders , even in the thin , brown braid of hair that hung just below her shoulders though at its end was perched a satin hair-bow as airy as a butterfly about to float away . But the guests , busy talkingas they sat in the chairs that had been placed against the walls , noticed none of this . Mrs. Mueller came into the parlor and went , to thep168piano , where she leaned down to whisper in Elsie 's ear , " All right now , Elsie . They 're ready , " and backed away to stand by the doors of the parlor to watch the ceremony . Elsie struck out the first chords of the wedding march which was to bring Selma and Kruger into the room , and though she struck down firmly on the keys , as if in an effort to control her hands , there was a wavering in the notes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangedhis book before him , and the guests , their talking silenced , sat back stiffly , expectantly in their chairs . Kruger came in with Selma on his arm and she smiled to her guests as they walked to the table . Then Elsie 's playingsoftened , and though she continued to play as the minister spoke , her touch was so soft that sometimes it seemed almost as if no sound came from the piano at all . " In the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost . Amen . " Elsie looked more intently at the score on the rack before her . " Dearly Beloved : we are assembled in the sight of God and His holy angels , to join together this man and this woman in the bonds of matrimony ; which is an honorable estate , instituted of God in the time of man 's innocency , confirmed by the teaching of our blessed Saviour , and comparedby Saint Paul to the mystical union which subsists between Christ and His Church . " The red flush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her neck under the braid flushed red , but Selma was looking past the familiar face of the minister to the wall where hung the large heavily-framed photograph she had had taken just after her marriage to Charlie Verkle . She heard the minister 's first words , but then she was thinking suddenly that now her picture would have to be moved outp169of the center of the wall again , leaving there an unfaded spot on the gay wallpaper , and Kruger 's would be hung beside it . In the storeroom , or somewhere in the house , that old frame from the photograph of Charlie which she had burned still lay . It would be good for Kruger 's picture , now . So she did not hear the minister until suddenly she knew that he was looking at her , saying , " . . . if either of you know any reason why ye may not be lawfully joined together in matrimony , confess it now . For be well assured , that all those who are brought together , contrary to the word of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their marriage lawful . " When he paused after those words she felt a moment of panic , of inexplicable fright as she thought that now some one would leap up and cry a halt to her marriage . But the minister was going on , talking now to Kruger : " Christian Kruger , wilt thou take this woman to be thy wedded wife ? Wilt thou love her , comfort her , honor , and keep her in sickness and in health ; and forsaking every other , cleave to her only , so long as ye both shall live ? " Out of the corner of her eye she could see Kruger 's beard move as he answered , " I will . " Then the minister turned to her , speaking the same words , and she answered in the same way , with a dry throat and parched lips , " I will . " It was at that moment that she noticed for the first time that Elsie had actually stopped playing the piano , and involuntarilyshe turned away from the minister to look over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Elsie was not there , and heard , over the minister 's words , the sound of the screen door close softly at the back of the house . She turned back to the table , annoyed , almost confused . But the ceremony of the ring was taking place , every-pI70 thing going very swiftly now . She had one clear picture of Kruger standing beside her , and then the ring was on her finger already , the plain gold band , and now she was puttingher ring on Kruger 's , the ring sticking for a moment on his knuckle , and then , with a little pressure , slipping over it and down . But it was all as if she were going through a performance so well known to her that it requiredno thought , almost as if she were in a dream or a trance , acting without knowledge , for her mind was on Elsie now , and what the minister was saying only a vague blur in her ears , until she heard the words of the benedictionand knew that the marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the contract , next to Kruger 's and to those of her witnesses , one of them Milly Werner , her old friend . It was over and she felt Kruger 's beard pressed against her face as he kissed her cheek . Then every one in the room was fluttering about her , hands were extended , thrust at her , but it was still as if she were dreaming , only vaguely aware of what was happening , and she kept looking over the little crowd around her , through the parlor doors . Then she went out of the room , quietly and quickly , wanting suddenly to find Elsie , to embrace her and try to make up to her for what she had done , try to make her feel that there was nothing shameful in it , that she was a good mother who loved her . She went out into the kitchen , looked around her for a moment , and then hurried out on to the porch and down into the garden , to the arbor . She saw her then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crumpled under her , weeping with sobs that could be heard all through the garden . Lisa was there , too , letting her cry without soothing her , letting her loneliness grow on her so that her hate could grow . She was walking back and forthp171in the grass near the place where the young girl lay , back and forth , back and forth , some strong purpose in her upliftedface , a bitter agony in her soft mouth , now tightly closed . From the place where she stood , Selma felt that she was seeing these two from a distance of miles , that there was nothing that she could do to bring them closer to her , or herself to them . And as her mind went back to the small assemblage in the house waiting by now to toast her with wine , as her mind went back to Kruger and saw him as he looked in the moment when the rings had joined them  --  trusting and open-faced in honesty , but strong in temper and , when he needed , powerful , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that now , she thought , What have I done ? What have I done ? It was another autumn , with the wind smoky again , and high in the trees , and the leaves turning brilliant with the season , and falling again , scattering down through the haze in oblique lines on the wind , and drifting across the seer grass listlessly . Though it was only noon , though only half of her day was done , she was tired and walked home slowly , with a dragging reluctance in her step that was not like her , and as she looked at the trees , at the leaves blowingand falling , at the hills across the dark blue stretch of the river , purple and purple-red in the smoky air , she thought of another year ending now , and thought briefly for the space of a moment that she had seen forty-five autumns begin , forty-five years end , and thought how swiftly the years turned and renewed themselves , how swiftly they passed . She was still thinking that it was sum- mer when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was autumn again , saw the trees growing briefly splendid and then almost at once naked and scrawny , and summer was over before she knew it and she was once more packing her bag to go to Milwaukee to buy up for the fall and winter . Work was always so hard and so steady that she did not see how the world changed , but she saw how work changed , how her business bettered , how now she would have to do something about her clerks . There were the two boys , one of them for delivery and help in the store when he was not delivering , and Lisa and herself . Lisa for years had gone home late in the morning and again in the afternoon , but now , with such a crowd as she had in the store this noon , and Lisa at home already , there was not enough help . She would not hire another clerk , as long as there was Elsie , and now Elsie had had two years in high school , and that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had started , Elsie had been going for more than a week , and now she would have to be told that there was only one thing to do  --  stop school and stay at home , take care of the house and make the meals so that Lisa could stay in the store . Otherwise it meant another clerk , and she could not afford that . There was no sense in it so long as you had a strong girl of your own who could do the work . Elsie could . She worked willingly , never complaining , had quickly enough fallen into the habit of helping Kruger where she could , so that now she never had to be told to clean his boots or mend his clothes , or , when he was in a hurry , to help him into his coat . She climbed the steps to the door of the house slowly , leaning heavily on the rail , and pushed in the door with her shoulder , her arms too tired to make the effort . In the house she took off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lisa came in to see who it was , and , seeing Selma , said , " Oh . " Then she walked across the room and stood by the window , looking out , with Selma forgotten , with no interest in her , no interest in how the end of the morning had gone . " Is Elsie home yet ? " Selma asked . " No , not yet , " Lisa said without turning from the window , her eyes hazy , lost to the landscape outside , to any one who might be passing . " Christian ? " Selma asked . Lisa did not hear . " Lisa , I asked you something ! " Selma said sharply . " Wake up ! " Lisa turned her face from the window , let the cloud of preoccupation clear away from her eyes , and asked , " Did you ? " . " Is Christian home yet ? " " Oh ! No , I guess not . " She looked at Lisa closely , and said , " I have to do something about clerks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly there was an expression of anger in her eyes , and she broke through the shell as she said almost passionately , " I wish you 'd do something about that ceiling . Look how the paper 's startingto come down . I wish you 'd get the sofa covered , too . The cloth is all ragged , worn through right to the padding . " Selma sighed . " That can wait , " she said . " But the clerks ca n't . " " Oh , no , nothing in the store can wait , can it , but here everything must wait , forever ! There you 've got a telephone , there everything 's kept repaired and painted and new-looking , there you are n't afraid to spend money . But here  --  not a cent if you can help it , not a cent ! Why can'tp174we have lights now , when everybody else in town is getting them ? Why do we have to go on using lamps when everybody else is throwing them out , putting in lights ? Why , Selma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her . " The old lamps are good enough for us , " she said , and , after a moment , " A good farmer 's barn is a lot bigger than his house , Lisa . " Lisa 's passion had spent itself , and her solitude crept around her again , crept into her voice as she said , " What 's wrong with the clerks ? " " I 'm worn out already from the rush just before noon . I 'm not so young as I used to be . I ca n't stand running around so much any more . I 've got to have more help , or keep you there until noon . " Lisa did not answer . She walked away from the window , back into the kitchen , closing the door . It was as if she had not heard , as if she walked in a dream that admitted into itself nothing actual . Selma stretched her tired body out on the sofa and lay staring at the ceiling where the paper was torn and beginning to sag . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still on her tiredness , on the failing strength of her body , on this weariness which , ten years ago or even five , she had never felt after so little effort . But it was not only the work that tired her out ; it was something else ; something in her nerves , or in her bones . It was something that had to do with Kruger , some tenseness she was beginning to feel with him , something that kept her nerves strung tight through her body and that left her weaker after he had gone from her presence , and even then the mere thought of him kept her on edge , brought that ache into her bones . For now they had been married almost five years , and there had been , of course , no son for him , and now he was beginningpI75to think that there would never be one , and she was beginning to hate his insistence , all her passion for him gone , and that old lust that she had felt when first he asked her to marry him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something like fear , and yet she felt herself stronger than he , and , with her secret ( though that had undergone a subtle change , was not so strong a thing ) , more powerful , for that made of him her slave . Elsie came in now . She wore a red cape that Lisa had made for her from an old serge dress , and on her head a little red cap with a plume of black on it . Her braid , with a plaid bow at the end of it , was almost jaunty , and in her face there was more cheer , more frankness , even more color than Selma was used to seeing there . " Hello , Mama , " she said . Selma sat up and looked at her more closely . She was sixteen years old , and yet , for all her bright clothes , she looked older , almost like twenty , with something drawn and frightened in her face in spite of the flush of color there now , something pinched and timid and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome . Elsie was not as handsome now at sixteen , Selma thought , as she had been when she married Charlie , at twenty-two ; for Elsie was shorter and slighter , and her head was not proud as Selma 's had been , with fine hair and eyes and courage in her chin . Her eyes were gray and weak and her hair thin , and only the slim braid down her back , not two heavy ones such as Selma had had when she was her age . Only her mouth was handsome , and that was Charlie 's , full and soft and attractive in a girl though it had always made Charlie 's weakness clear . There was something of Charlie in the girl , too , something of his weakness in the way she gave in to others and what others wanted , something ofp176Charlie in her timidity and lack of spirit or of pride . But she was a good girl . " How 's school ? " Selma asked , with no interest in her voice but something tentative , something plotted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're going to have a play beforeChristmas . There was a meeting this morning and I 'm going to be Mathilda , the heroine . It 's a musical play , and there are four songs in it for me . " Her face brightened as she spoke . " One of them 's a waltz , " she said , " and it goes like this : ta-ti-ta-ti-taa  --  ta-ti-ta-ti-taa  --  taa-ti-ta-ti-ta ; and I dance to it , like this  --  " She picked up the edge of her plaid skirt and began to circle around the room , bending down and swaying up again to the simple melody of the waltz she hummed , dipped and swayed , swooped around behind the table with a display of pleasure that confused Selma , made her look away . It seemed so strange in the child ; or was she the stranger ? She looked away , knowing now that it would be harder for the girl to give up school ; but she told herself as she often did that every penny she saved was one more for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind if it did mean something like not being in a play , which was nonsense anyway ! What did that get you in the end ? Then both of them heard Kruger on the back porch stamping the dirt from his boots , heard him come in and greet Lisa , and then saw him as he stood in the kitchen door . He looked at the two of them , at Elsie particularly as she still stood in the middle of the room with her skirt lifted in the gesture of the waltz . " Hello , " he said in his gruff voice . Then she felt it again , from that single word , the tightening of her nerves in his presence , the shrinking inside ofp177her that wearied her with its tension . " Hello , " she said , and thought to herself that whatever this was , this feeling she had about him , it was silly , it was something unworthy of her , something that she had to fight against and capture and destroy . " Was it a good morning ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down heavily on a chair near the window , from where he could look down to Water Street and the river . " You can tell already , " he said , staring out , " how people are going to stop buying horses , how they all think that they 'll get along with the horses they got until they can get a ' mobile . Those things wo n't help my business any ! " He leaned closer to the window . " There goes one of the damned things now ! " " Well , " Selma said , " they have to have horses in the fields , even if they got a ' mobile . You ca n't work a farm with a ' mobile . " Kruger looked at her briefly and then back toward the street , and went on almost sullenly . " You ca n't tell what they 'll have next . First thing you know it will be that ! " " filch ! " Selma said . Lisa came in from the kitchen . " Dinner 's ready , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the table in the kitchen , the three women and the man . Lisa talked to Elsie in a low voice , so that what they said could not he clearly heard , but you could see , when they talked together , how both of them brightened , how they loved each other , and , by their love , shut out the two who were by now without it . Kruger ate his food silently , quickly , wasting no time at the table , and Selma ate silently , too , but darted her eyes from Kruger 's face to the face of Lisa now and then , and often to Elsie 's as she described to Lisa the play she was in , told her in a low voice that did not hide her enthusiasm , its story.  |p178Selma  put down her fork . " You make that play too important , " she said , and at once Elsie 's expression changed , becoming again sober and pinched , all the brightness gone . " Where will that get you , or what ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking down at her food . There was a long silence as Selma saw by Lisa 's face that now she knew what she had in mind . Lisa looked across the table at Selma with hard , resentful eyes , but Selma , by her glance , defied Lisa 's , and , perhaps because Lisa looked at her that way , went on at once . " The work at the store is getting to be too much for me . Lisa has to leave always just when the rush comes in the morning , and the boy is usually delivering then , too , and I ca n't handle it any more with just the other one . I 've thought it all over and there 's only one thing to do . You 've got to quit school , Elsie . " Elsie 's pale eyes looked at her mother . Then her lower lip began to tremble , and she could only start to talk , only say " Mama  --  " in mild protest and disbelief , before Selma went on . " Otherwise it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Business is n't as good as it could be , and there is n't any sense in hiring another clerk when there 's an ablebodiedgirl in the family . You think , Elsie , that school and that play and stuff like that are important , but when you get older you 'll see they are n't , you 'll see that I 'm right . I never went to high school at all , worked all my life , had to , and I 'm as far now as most women can get . You , too , Elsie , can do that , and you 'll see some day how what I say is true . " Elsie was looking at her food , untouched now before her , but she was not weeping . In the way she bent her head there was resignation to sorrow met before , sorrow known ,  |p179sorrow  almost expected , resignation and already a dumb acceptance of the sorrow which the bent head said was inevitable . At last , when Selma had finished speaking , she looked up . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her eyes there was all the dumb weight of her grief and misery that was not in her words . She waited a moment longer and then stood up quickly and went out . There was a pause . Then Kruger struck down on the table with his palm , said suddenly , " Ach , Selma , why do n't you let her finish ? You can afford to hire ten more clerks if you want to . Why take it out on the girl ? " Selma looked at him with sudden anger . " She 's my child , " she said . " I 'll do as I think best . " Then she rememberedsuddenly , for no clear reason , Elsie sitting on the stoop of the back porch steps a few days before , scraping caked mud and dung from Kruger 's boots , her head bent over the unpleasant task as it had been bent over her food before she left the table a moment past . There was the briefesttwinge of something that must be sorrow in her throat , a fleeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more . But then Lisa , who had sat quietly , silently hating , throughout the scene , suddenly sprang to her feet and began to scream . Her hands were clenched at her side , but her face was wild with futile anger , and it was she who wept , the tears streaming down her cheeks . She stood over Selma and screamed , " Oh Gott , Gott , I hate you , I hate you ! " her voice hoarse with misery , and then rushed from the room , too , outside , to follow the girl . There was a pause . Kruger shook his head , pityingly . " Then he said , " You could get another clerk , Selma . " Selma ate without replying and there was a long silence in which she felt Kruger 's eyes on her , and inside she beganp18o to feel that tightening again , that tensing in her nerves , and as this grew , her fury grew , and she looked up suddenly , her face flushed with anger , and cried , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing ? " Kruger watched her , smiling a little behind his beard , pitying and scorning her in a proud silence which she could not endure , so that she stood up quickly and went into the other room , where she put on her hat and coat , and went out into the street , hurrying back now to the store , where she could be free of him and at peace again . She began to run . Then she walked again and wondered why she should be so excited , why she should start to run right in the middle of Water Street , but even as she wondered , she began to run again , and she began to know why . It was Elsie now , Elsie , Elsie ! To get to Elsie as soon as she could was the thing ! And her mind called Elsie ! Elsie ! as she ran , as even her feet on the concrete seemed to her to cry the name , Elsie ! Elsie ! In her hand she clutched tight the little package with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that might make the difference , she thought as she ran . And if it did , if it did , if it did ! Her feet as they struck the cement seemed to say that then  --  if it did ! if it did ! She thought , Ah , if it could ! She darted in under the trees around the house and ran on toward the back door . There she stopped . She leaned against the house , trying to catch her breath , knowing that she could never face the girl so excited , so out of breath , this strange feeling so plainly in her face and in her excitement . She made herself sit down on the steps for a moment , and hold back the wish to run into the house , top181throw her arms around the girl , or something as foolish as that ! As she sat on the steps the sound of the piano came faintly from the house . It was Elsie playing , but the sound through the closed doors was far away , almost like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was one of the songs she often played , a melody familiar to Selma 's cars . She sat and strained to hear the tinkling sound , and her breath began to come evenly again , the hard panting after her run through the streets to smooth out into even breathing . Soon she would go in . Yet it was hard now to go in , hard now for her to face the girl , to tell her the thing that had leapt into her mind as she ran , to give her the ring . It made her feel ashamed as she sat there , and yet she wanted to go in , to speak , to put the ring on her finger . Wanted to ! The year before she had forgotten Elsie 's birthday , had not thought of it until she had discovered Elsie and Lisa upstairs late that night , and had seen Elsie before the mirror in the new dress that Lisa had bought for her . Then she had been ashamed , and next day she had given her a present , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a present because she had forgotten about it at the time when she should have remembered . Then she had simply handed the gloves to Elsie , coldly , not even kissing her , because she was ashamed , and the girl had taken them and gone away somewhere , hidden somewhere in the house , perhaps to weep . This year she had not forgotten . She had seen the ring in the jeweler 's window and she had asked him to put it aside for her , but she had not planned to give it to Elsie until supper . But with Kruger in the store all morning , sitting around watching her every move , grinning at her when she talked to customers as if there were something to laugh at in the way she did business , making her feel all morning something almost like scorn in his smile , scorn and his pride , until the tenseness of her nerves made her almost want to cry out something against him , a curse for his pride which he did not rightfully hold because it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret now  --  with that going on all morning she had decided suddenly that she would not wait to give Elsie the ring , but would go home at once and put it on her finger herself . Why had all that come ? Why , as she felt Kruger 's eyes on her , did her blood boil suddenly with hate and her nerves stretch themselves out tight with fear ? And why , then , as she stood at the front of the store just looking at the hotel across the street , thinking nothing much , why then , suddenly , did she want to cry ? She ! want to cry ? Why ? Why then suddenly did she think that her life was not all that it might be , that perhaps she had done wrong to Lisa and Elsie both ? Why ? She had turned round to look at Kruger , had hesitated a moment in which she wished suddenly to bring back between them some of that friendliness that had been between them once , but had turned away again to look out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pit of emptiness . Then the tears had actually been in her eyes . Then she hated that emptiness , hated standing there by the window alone , miles away from everybody else in the world , even from her sister , her husband , her child . Then tears crept down her face . What had happened to her , what was the meaning of her sadness , her feeling that she had lost something , when she knew that she was getting everything she wanted in the world . But the sadness had been so strong in her that shep183had gone to the safe , opened it , found the little box with the ring , and gone out to take it to Elsie at once . Then , involuntarily , she had started to run , had stopped , and then had run again , all the way home , needing Elsie now , needing her child , thinking that of the three of them , Elsie she could find again ! She stood up and went quietly into the house . The sound of the piano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elsie 's voice , singing , lilting along : In the good old summer time , The good old summer time , Strolling through the shady lane -- Selma tiptoed through the sitting room to the parlor doors , and there she stood quietly , looking at Elsie 's back as she sang , watching Elsie 's hands on the keys of the piano . The girl did not know that she stood there . You hold her hand And she holds yours , And that 's a very good sign -- she sang , and Selma could see how she swayed her head to the song , how even her shoulders swayed to the music , freely , almost gaily . In the good old summer time -- Elsie 's voice died in the parlor . Then her hands wandered idly up and down the keyboard , striking aimlessly a chord here and another there , her fingers idly dancing out a scale , and then treading firmly through four or five long , deep chords again . Then they had hit on another melody , and Selma heard the beginning of another song , familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Elsie played it . Then she began again , and sang again : In the shade of the old apple tree , Where the love in your eyes I could see , When the voice that I heard , Like the song of the bird , Seemed to whisper sweet music to meSelma , standing in the door , felt through her whole body a rush of sadness . It was something in Elsie 's voice that had brought it , some sadness there , some yearning for something she did not have , as if she too had lost somethingthat she would never find again . The girl was happy there , Selma knew , happy and free as she had never seen her , for with her , Elsie was always quiet , constrained , hidingeverything she felt behind her timidity , and now , when she did not know that Selma was watching and hearing , Elsie was free . But there was that sadness in her voice , too , the yearning for something lost , something never to be found . Selma thought , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! She must love me now , she must stay with me , against him ! Elsie 's voice : I could hear the dull buzz of the bee In the blossoms , as you said to me , " With a heart that is true , I 'll be waiting for you , In the shade of the old apple tree . " Her voice faded again in the parlor , and for a moment Elsie sat before the piano with her hands laid together in her lap . Then Selma spoke , " Elsie  --  " Elsie swung round . There was not only surprise in her face , but shame , confusion , even fear . She jumped up.  | " Mama ! " she cried . " What are you home for ? How long were you standing there ? " Selma felt herself moving forward . Now it was not she who moved , or not she , at least , who wanted to move . It was something outside her that fixed her face in a vapid smile of tenderness , that made her feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the pitiable fright and the pitiable shame in Elsie 's pinched face . She went up to her and put her arms around her neck . Then she laid her lips against the girl 's cold cheek . Under her hands she could feel Elsie trembling . " Mama , what 's wrong ? " the girl 's voice quavered . Selma beamed on her with that vapid smile . She felt herself out of her familiar world , felt herself in an almost dream-like state in which she moved without will . She spoke , said , then , " Elsie , this year I did n't forget . Here , " and laid in Elsie 's hand the little box . " Oh ! " Elsie said . The surprise in her face was clearer . She opened the box , looked silently at the ring there , the sparkling red stone in the gold setting shaped like a rose . " Oh , Mama ! " she said . Selma could feel how her face was frozen into that smile . " Thank you , " Elsie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at her . " Do you like it , Elsie ? " she asked . " Oh , ja , ja . . . " she said softly , but her eyes were wide with surprise , with lack of understanding , with the look of a stranger still . Selma saw the look . There was a long silence in the parlor . Elsie 's eyes shifted back and forth , as if she were hunting on the floor and the walls for words to cover her embarrassment . And slowly Selma felt herself brought back to the world she knew , back to more familiar feeling . Then she gave Elsie one more glance , and looked away too , so confused that she could not speak.
