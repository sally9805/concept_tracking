txt A form of police graft In which ticket speculators who hawk their wares outside theatres and places such as the Yankee Stadium before a prize fight are made to give up cash tribute as well as tickets which find their way into the hands of some magistrate 's court clerks was described to Isidor J. Kresel yesterday . At the same time the Appellate Division inquiry delved into the circumstances surrounding the payment to Hyman Bushel , a practicing attorney and former Magistrate , of a $7,000 fee by an alleged fence who was subsequently discharged . In midafternoon Mr. Kresel announced that a public hearing would be held today at 10:30 A. M. and , although he did not reveal its purpose , it was learned that Mapocha Acuna , confessed " stool - pigeon , " would make new revelations on the operations of the " women 's court vice ring , " in which he has implicated policemen , lawyers and bail bondsmen . Acuna would be ? followed , it was said , by several women who were " framed " by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a year in jail . Early yesterday Lieutenant William Delaney , mentioned by Acuna in his testimony which named twenty-eight policemen , filed an application for retirement , to which he is entitled by reason of twenty-five years ' service . The application followed the action of Police Commissioner Mulrooney , who transferred Delaney from the detective division at the West Sixty-eighth Street station to desk duty in five lower Manhattan precincts . Theatre Ticket Men Questioned . Revelations of ticket graft followed the examination of Oscar Alexander , a broker , of 200 West Forty-second Street , and representatives of the Adelphia Ticket Agency of 1,504 Broadway and the Broad Street Agency at 25 Broadway , who appeared under subpoena . They had been told to bring with them their records of the account of James Graff , a bondsman in 315 West Fifty-fourth Street , just across the street from the West Side Court . It was the original supposition that the ' records might furnish some evidence to show how magistrates , court clerks and attendants obtained choice theatre tickets as favors . It developed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been told how speculators were forced to pay $5 a day to the patrolman on the beat in wiich they operated to forestall being molested . Occasionally , however , it was said , the speculators were arrested anyway and their tickets confiscated . Ostensibly these tickets are sent to the property clerk at Police Headquarters , but , it was said , they rarely were . Instead , they go to clerks in the courts where the men are to be arraigned , with the result , it was charged , that convictions rarely follow , although the tickets are never returned . It was estimated that there were about 200 such speculators in New York , which would fix the amount of money paid patrolmen to let them operate at about $365,000 a year , although no estimate could be obtained on the amount of money which might be involved in the seized tickets . Bushel , Queried on Fee . The investigation of the Bushel fee of $7,000 came after Carl Ackerman , la second cousin of " Uncle Nathan " Vlodinger , who has said that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sessions Judge Max Levine , had been examined privately by Mr. Kresel . Mr. Bushel appeared a few minutes after being called . 1 He spent fifty-five minutes with Mr , Kresel . ? On emerging he saw newspaper photographers and darted ! back into . Mr. Kresel 's office and left through a rear door . He went , however , to his office , which is on Broadway near the County Courts Building , and there he declared that he had " nothing to say . " Ackerman said he had been ques- ? tioned concerning a $7,000 fee which was paid to Bushel some seven or eight years ago by an alleged fence . He said that his cousin , Viodinger , had furnished bond for the man who was charged with receiving stolen property and had also advanced him 1,000 on a note . The man was subsequently discharged in  --  magistrate 's court , Ackerman said . Although new disclosures , " as sensational as any yet made , " at the public hearing today , the fourth since the investigation began several months ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the testimony would be in the nature of corroboration of Acuna 's previous story . It was also expected that the matter of dispute between Acuna and Deputy Chief Inspector Ryan would be settled . Acuna testified that Ryan gave him his first lesson in the conduct and duties of a " stool-pigeon ; " Ryan indignantly denied ever seeing Acuna . The action of Lieutenant- , Delaney seemed to presage a tedious task for Commissioner Mulrooney . It was definitely learned that the application , filed in the usual manner , had followed the routine channel to the desk of Acting Chief Inspector John J. Sullivan , in charge in the absence of Chief Inspector O'Brien . The routine witn such an application is tnat it is forwarded from the captain of the precinct to the inspector in charge of the district , then to the Chief Inspector , who passes upon it and forwards it to the Police Commissioner . Late yesterday Commissioner Mulrooney denied that he had received the application , although it was known to have reached Sullivan during the morning . This was interpreted as meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he had opportunity to investigate Delaney 's case , although in the two departmental precedents , under Commissioners Waldo and Enright , the police head ? was forced by court order to permit retirement under similar circumstances . Delaney entered the department Sept. 27 , 1905 . He was made a lieutenant on April 11 of this year . In retirement he is entitled to half pay of $2,000 a year . Delaney openly resented his transfer . " I never made a vice arrest in my life , " he declared , " and I never introduced Acuna to anybody . " Delaney declared that on Aug. 20 , 1928 , a restaurant keeper , Angelo Nieva , had been held up , robbed and murdered . Acuna , he said , reported to him a conversation which the stool-pigeon had overheard and which resulted in the arrest of a man who was later discharged . , Acuna testified that following this Delaney had introduced him to " Inspector Ryan , " and Ryan had assigned him to the vice squad .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
