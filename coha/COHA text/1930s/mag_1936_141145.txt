The traditional knowledge of British subjects that their civil servants are incorruptible was at stake last week as a verdict was handed down on the recent case in which part of Chancellor of the Exchequer Neville Chamberlain 's new Budget leaked out in advance to speculators who made small killings by insuring with Lloyd 's Underwriters against new and higher taxes ( TIME , May 4 et seq . ) . Because the secrets thus disclosed in criminal violation of the Official Secrets Act were known to every Cabinet member , to high Treasury civil servants and even to Government printers , Britons last week awaited earnestly the findings of Parliament 's Special Tribunal of Inquiry over which presided testy and upright Justice Sir Samuel Lowry Porter . <P> Reported the Tribunal : " We have seen Sir Maurice Hankey Secretary to the Cabinet , Sir Warren Fisher head of the Civil Service and Sir Maurice Gwyer Parliamentary Counsel to the Treasury in the witness box . We unhesitatingly accept their evidence as regards themselves , their subordinates , and those engaged in the civil service generally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of confidential nature . <P> " We find no shred of evidence to suggest that any of the persons mentioned or described was even in communication with any of those who effected insurance , and that no leakage from such a source was suggested . " The same observations apply to all Cabinet Ministers save J. H. Thomas and to all those persons to whom information as to the Budget was supplied before its publication to the House of Commons . " <P> To London 's press this finding was grand news . " It is impossible to read the cold and fearless words of the report without a feeling of pride , surely not unpardonable , in our public and parliamentary traditions , " cried the Labor Daily Herald . " For comparison , " boomed the Conservative Daily Express , " you need to recall the Stavisky Scandal in France and the United States Teapot Dome oil scandals , which dragged on for years . " In editorials of modest understatement , Fleet Street reminded everyone that only six weeks had elapsed since the Budget leaked- another record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poor Old Jim . " In exonerating everyone except J. H. Thomas the verdict , although otherwise wholly a source of satisfaction , last week moved many British hearts to pity . It was recalled that Leaker Thomas had been an intimate friend of the late King George , and as the London Times said : " Let no one withhold a measure of sympathy from Thomas himself and the family concerned ... In the crisis of 1931 he Thomas was one of only two or three men who stood firm in the midst of political chaos and made possible the National Government which staved off disaster . "
