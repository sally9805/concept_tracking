Last week Milwaukee went to the polls , turned out its Socialist city attorney and five of its Socialist city councilmen , turned down eight out of twelve other Socialist candidates for the council , defeated Socialist candidates for city treasurer and city controller , rejected a Socialist proposal for municipal ownership of the local electric company . Milwaukee further demonstrated the extent of its current Red scare ( TIME , April 6 ) when it returnedSocialist Mayor Daniel Webster Hoan to City Hall for his seventh term by 111,167 votes to 97,124 for his Non-Partisan opponent , Sheriff Joseph John Shinners-a majority only one-third as large as that non-Socialist city gave its famed Marxist Mayor in 1932.
