txt Banks and Small Loans . A great many people seem to feel that safety of deposits is all that is required of a banking system . But these deposits must be lent . With upward of 20,000 banks in the country the small business man and the farmer had a better chance of obtaining credit than if there had been only a few , and while it is true that many of these banks failed because they granted long-time credits , what would the small business man and the farmer have done without them7 If branch banking is authorized , relatively few banks will remain in the business , and these banks will probably not lend money to the farmer and the small business man . Centralization of banking will drive the small man out of business and will render the farm problem more acute than it has ever been. ? WILLIAM R. MARTIN , Brooklyn .
