Dark Victory ( Warner Bros. - First National ) , if it were an automobile , would be a Rolls-Royce with a Brewster body and the very best trimmings . Though not up to Wuthering Heights ( TIME , April 17 ) , it is one of the best star vehicles Hollywood has produced this year . As a play , it was not a success when Tallulah Bankhead took it to Broadway four years ago . Refashioned by Screenwriter Casey Robinson to fit Bette Davis , Warners ' most talented and ambitious star , it gives her a chance to do a good job and puts her well up in line for her third Academy Award . <P> As Judith Traherne , Bette Davis is a horsy Long Island heiress with a stable of steeplechasers and a tongue like a riding crop , which she and her friends blame on her unusually severe hangovers . She discovers , from a personable young brain surgeon ( George Brent ) , that her headaches have a more serious cause . The surgeon knows that every day brings her closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his Vermont farm , Judith knows too , but is convinced that the victory has been hers . <P> Though this plot gives the film an unfair advantage over sentimental audiences , and Actress Davis plucks every heartstring she can lay a finger on , under Edmund Goulding 's delicate , direction she makes Dark Victory moving but not morbid . The picture allows pretty , able newcomer Geraldine Fitzgerald ( Wuthering Heights ) to put a shapely foot forward , gives Humphrey Bogart , as an Irish groom who loves Judith for her breeding , a chance to act without a gun up his sleeve . Memorable sequence : Judith trying to put her horse over a jump on a morning when her hangover is worse than usual . <P> Back Door to Heaven ( Odessco Productions , Paramount release ) is an awkward attempt to crash the back door of the cinema industry . It is notable as the first effort of a new producing company headed by Bernard Steele and Stanley Odium ( son of Investment Truster Floyd Bostwick Odium , whose Atlas Corp . has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the $350,000 it cost to make the picture in Astoria , L. I. ) . <P> Gray , unaccented , often pointless , Back Door to Heaven shows the progress of dim-witted Frankie Rogers ( Wallace Ford ) from the wrong side of the tracks to the wrong side of the bars . Largely a one-man job , the picture owes its sincerity and its faults to husky , sentimental Director <P> William K. Howard ( Fire Over England ) . Director Howard ( on a profit-sharing basis ) wrote the original story , produced and directed Back Door to Heaven , laid it in his home town of St. Mary 's , Ohio , at the last moment smeared himself with grease and enacted the part of the prosecuting attorney who sends Frankie to the chair . Such versatility caused Director Howard 's friends at Manhattan 's Stork Club , whose major-domo Jack Entratter got a policeman 's part in the picture , to refer to him as " Noel Howard . " Back Door to Heaven being what it is , this crack was no compliment to England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
