txt Spying , once a grim adventure of war , has become a crowded peacetime profession in Europe . There are spies , rings of spies , counter spies ; there are arrests , trials , long jail terms , executions . For Europe is rearming ; the armament secrets of one nation are coveted by another . The spy finds much work to do . Two weeks ago twenty-one persons , including two Americans , Robert Gordon Switz and his wife , were put on trial in France as members of an international espionage ring ; shortly before that Germany sent two women  --  Baroness von Berg and Frau Renate von Natzmer  --  to the executioner 's block and sentenced another woman , Frau von Jena , to life imprisonment for spying in behalf of Poland . On April 12 Richard Roiderer , an American school teacher , will be tried in Berlin , presumably on the charge that he gathered facts concerning Storm Troop activities . The group now brought to book in France was trapped by counter spies on advices received from Helsingfors , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Arvid Jacobsson , an American , were sentenced to eight years ' imprisonment . Changes in Espionage . It was an oddly assorted group , emphasizing anew the changing character of espionage . The legendary spy  --  a siren with eyes as blue as corn-flowers and hair the color of corn-tassel , as was the " madonna of Antwerp , " Germany 's cleverest spy during the war ; or a Mats . Hari , the sinuous Javanese dancer for whose favors men bartered honor and the lives of troops in transport at sea ? is as outmoded as yesterday 's " thriller . " Though beauty is still an asset and sex continues to play a leading role , that role is no longer dominant . Peacetime espionage recruits scientists , those who have access to official documents or to new inventions of gases or guns , or who have knowledge of newly built fortifications or aviation plans . Hardly a month passes without a spy scare in some corner of Europe ; and few years have seen as many women spies featured as 1934 . Amalie Lantern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Redhead , " recently began an eight years ' sojourn in an Estonian prison . Lydia von Stahl was called the " master mind " of the group arrested by French authorities . Case of Sophie Drost . Sophie Drost , whose exceptional beauty moved her jailers to call her " La Belle Sophie , " has been sentenced to two years ' imprisonment in France . She transmitted to a foreign power plans of the mechanism of a French machine gun which is said to fire a greater number of rounds per minute than any similar weapon possessed by other nations . A feature of the gun is that by the turn of a single screw it is divisible into seven pieces , thereby facilitating transport . Sophie Drost 's case was unusual in that she was entrusted with the gun 's plans in their entirety . Though the average woman spy is skillful in evading detection , she often flutters around the bright lights of Europe 's gay places and is not fully trusted . Women who actually unearth information are few and highly rated , and generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The woman spy passes along a bit of information without knowledge of its value , for the value of military or other information depends on its relation to the whole . In every European capital there are spies , not affiliated with any secret service , for whom " espionage is a life profession . These are sober folk and very discreet . Their qualifications are good international connections , knowledge of languages , and an intuitive sense which corresponds to a newspaper man 's " nose for news . " The spy must have keen perception and be able to appraise quickly the value or practicability . of information . Also he must have skill in obtaining information . Traders in Facts . Spies in this special class arc sometimes " retained " by several governments and act as clearers of information . They have " contacts " and know who is operating and how he may be useful . To obtain Information they impart informa-1 tion , often driving shrewd bargains . These gentry are the despair of the counter-spy . They are as clever as Indians in covering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they generally possess some obvious and camouflaging means of support , often connected with the fine arts . Also the professional spy " knows the ropes " and seldom invites suspicion . He knows that many Europeans , particularly Latins , misinterpret liberality . The man who overtips proclaims himself , to the French and Italians at least , as one anxious to ingratiate himself . And why ? It-was the generous pourboires which marked the trail that led to the Franco-Swiss frontier town where the accomplices of the assassin of King Alexander of Yugoslavia were hiding . Each small hotel at which they had passed the night remembered the generous tippers and informed the police as soon as the hunt was on . Free Lance Spies . In addition to seasoned espions , free lance spies , little more than peepers and as dangerous as fools , have discovered that " intelligence " is a good part-time job . They are ingenious and work alone . Official announcements of public works often prove informative when read with the aid of a military map . Report of a proposed road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed spy quickly determines that such investment would seem unjustified by prospective traffic or returns is well worth transmitting to the War Office of another State , because it may convey to a foreign power the route of its neighbor 's mobilization in time of war . Information of this kind , or reports of lesser value , are hawked up and down the crossroads of Europe . Sometimes the information is sent by mail  --  a hazardous procedure . Not so long ago a woman was arrested in a fashionable hotel in Evian , on the French shore of Lake Geneva . She was wealthy and fond of motoring , and drove much and alone around the countryside in her sports car . She had been corresponding for some weeks with a student in Italy . The correspondence was mainly sentimental . In the exuberance of her emotion the woman underlined words . French Secret Service men were watching the correspondence . Underlined words are as decipherable as code ; they put the woman in jail . Economic Spying . Economic espionage is a postwar excrescence that has thrived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a chip on the shoulder . Customs barriers as provocative as spite fences stretch higher and higher across national frontiers , but the nimble economic spy can scale them and burrow his way back to make a report . Secrets of industrial production , machinery , and so forth , are as salable as " sucker lists . " While economic espionage has grown in importance in Europe and contributes its share to the atmosphere of distrust and suspicion , it is the political and military spy who is doing , perhaps , as much as the munition maker to stir up trouble . Costs of national intelligence service have kept pace with pyramiding military budgets . It is credibly estimated that three Continental countries spend a total of $15,000 , - 000 a year for secret service . Britain charges f200,000 a year for secret service , an advance over 1929 , when the figure quoted in Parliament was f180,000 . In the large countries of Continental Europe the individual outlay for secret service work exceeds considerably that of Britain .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
