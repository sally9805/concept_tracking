( See front cover ) <P> In the spring of 1912 an English-born stripling named Alfred E. Lyon took a train from Canada to Manhattan to look for a job . Getting off at Grand Central Station with no knowledge of the city , no specific job in mind , he turned right on 42nd Street , presently reached Sixth Avenue . There he saw a handsome store with a large display of Melachrino cigarets in the window . He asked the clerk inside about Melachrino . " Sure , " said the clerk , " that 's a swell company . It 's run by Mac McKitterick and Rube Ellis . ' ' A. E. Lyon went to see McKitterick , asked for a job as a Melachrino salesman . <P> " I 'm sorry , ' ' said McKitterick , " but we have no opening for a salesman just now . " <P> " Oh , " retorted Alfred Lyon , " so you 're selling all the Melachrino cigarets you want to ? " <P> " No , by God , we 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job . " <P> Alfred Lyon thereupon became a " missionary " at $15 a week , began to learn cigaret selling in the Ellis-McKitterick manner . Through the years and many a complicated corporate change the three stuck together . In 1931 Ellis and McKitterick emerged with working control of an inconspicuous 12-year-old firm named Philip Morris &; Co. , Ltd. , Inc. , with annual sales of about $3,000,000 . Last week Rube and Mac were not alive to see it , but Philip Morris was the No. 1 success story of a depression year . It had increased its sales 45% , its profits from $3,573,000 in fiscal 1937 to $5,663,000 in fiscal 1938 ( ending March 31 ) . Nor was this all . Last week Alfred Lyon , spearhead of P.M. 's sales drive since President McKitterick died in 1936 , announced that Philip Morris has finally ousted Old Gold from its ten-year berth in the " Big Four .

Otway Hebron Chalkley , born in Richmond some 50 years ago ( he is even bashful about his exact age ) , was the only child of a prosperous , respected leather merchant . In Richmond he is remembered now as an expert player of bandy ( a form of hockey ) , a proficient swimmer in the local holes-which go by such picturesque names as Soda Water , Cherry , Heaven , Hell-and a sober student . From school he went to work as an office boy for American Tobacco Co. at $3 a week , began a standard up-through-the-ranks career-factory manager in Newport News , clerk in Manhattan , a two year stint in Bulgaria buying Turkish leaf tobacco . Thence he returned to Manhattan to work again for American Tobacco , later for Tobacco Products Corp. , one of whose possessions was Melachrino . There he met Rube and Mac .

Twice during that period Rube Ellis journeyed to Shanghai and the two men became firm friends . In 1924 Rube took Chalkley back to Manhattan to be treasurer of Philip Morris .
