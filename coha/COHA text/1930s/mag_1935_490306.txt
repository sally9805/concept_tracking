WE see that Persia has changed its name to Iran ( heating out Bronxville , which is trying to become kralla Walla ) . What we want to know is whether this will affect the Persian Room at the Plaza . Will we have to meet you people , from now on , in the Iranian Room ? THE lone passenger , Mr. Ham-brook , who escaped unscathed from the airliner which fell on a snowy mountain upstate the other day hoarded another plane to continue his journey to NVashington . That plane did n't work either . It was forced down at Newark , the weather being inclement , and Mr. Hambrook settled himself in what the New York Times , with an eye to life 's transitory character , described as " the comparative security of a warm room in the Hotel McAlpin . " The Times was right about life and its uncertainties . While Mr. Hambrook was enjoying the McAlpin 's dubious security , a California clergyman , sitting at the Rose Bowl game , died of excitement ; a Negro sitting in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him , who objected to his putting his knee against the back of her chair ; four people sitting quietly at table in Elizabeth , N. J. , were asphyxiated when a rubber tube pulled loose from their gas stove ; and a Baltimore woman who was about to put some coal on her furnace was instantly killed by a sliver of steel which mysteriously burst from the firebox when she opened the door . Perhaps planes are as safe as any place , even though they are weather-shy and powerless in the end against the deathly gravity which tugs at us all . ONE of our sentries , stationed on East Thirty-seventh Street , has reported that two dozen gilt chairs with red seats were carried out of Mr. Morgan 's house on the Saturday morning before New Year 's . There is , the sentry thinks , a certain mystery connected with this , for there had been no previous evidence of any party no crush of limousines , no musicians sneaking in , no rented palms . To us it is not mysterious at all . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs for his own amusement , and had played many a mad game of Going-to-JerusaIem with the domestics . Either that or the chairs actually belonged to him and he was lending ' ern to Junius for a shindig . ADILIGENT reading of " Wine from These Grapes " has convinced Stanley Burnshaw , in the New Masses , that the author , Miss Millay , is revolutionary material . He gives her a terrific rush in the January l st issue , after apologizing carefully for her early waywardness in the field of romantic , or disassociated , literature . " Brilliant minor poems , " he calls the result of her first twenty years of hard labor . She is now confused , but intense , he finds . Phrases , here and there , bear the telltale mark of a rebellious political philosophy and are , by just that much , potentially great . One shove and she 'd go over . We do n't know whether Miss Malay intends to take the veil or not ; but we do feel that Mr. Burnshaw 's article itself reveals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it inimical to art . One is his categorical denial of the aesthetic worth of any form of expression save revolutionary . The other is his exclusiveness in ascribing a corrupt world to a corrupt stratum , instead of to a corrupt animal  --  half corrupt and half bewildered . A poet is a lonely being . Give Miss Millay a desk at party headquarters alongside Orrick Johns and Alfred Kreymhorg and we bet she 'd still be lonely , and her stuff no greater , nor any less great . CHRISTMAS seems a misty time of long ago . Only one incident stands out crisp and clear something told us by a witness , something we shall never forget . It was the visit of the St. Thomas 's choirboys to their neighbor across the street , Elizabeth Arden . Up the stairs they went , twenty carollers , twenty shining boyish faces , sweetly , solemnly singing the sweetest of all the carols ( " The first Nowell , the angel did say , was to . . . " ) , forty cherubic cheeks lit by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky over the cave in Bethlehem ( " In fields ? I where they lay , keeping their sheep ... " ) , up the stairs to the mud-bath department , where , closeted in little curtained compartments , heads covered with sticky ringlets , fingers uncutexed , arms not yet softened by that special preparation known as Milady 's Evening Whitening , lay ten ladies giving their all for Beauty , their faces mired in purest mud serene . ( " Nowell , Nowell , Born is the Ki-ing of I-s-ra-el . " ) ONCE upon a time , when we were working for an advertising concern which handled an automobile account , our boss approached us and said that what the automobile business needed was a new note in advertising . He said nobody had been able to think of anything new to say about a car . We were unable to think of anything ourself at the time , but since then we have followed automobile advertising closely , and to our notion nothing new developed until just a few days ago . It was Auburn that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or translate , if you will , their new supercharged model , which is sort of like a bullet and goes 100 miles an hour , Auburn , with that simplicity which often accompanies greatness , announced : " Again Auburn leads the way to more gracious living . " Thar , friends , is something new . Chrysler caused power to float , Buick put wizardry under control , but it took Auburn to supercharge grace and step it up to 100 miles an hour . Account of Rdin WHEN the Associated Press inaugurated their new telephoto service the other day , the manager of it gave a radio talk . To dramatize telephoto , he picked out an easy exampleof its wonders . " Right this minute , " he said , " in Philadelphia the Mummers ' Parade is taking place . Before that parade is over , pictures of it will he on the desks of editors in San Francisco .

Lindynna WE have on our desk a catalogue of an auction sale  --  some items from a collection of historical aviation material , offered for sale in Cincinnati a little while ago . The only items that will interest you at all are the Lindbergh things . No. 630 is a letter from James A. Edgerton to William B. kobertson , Lindbergh 's boss in the airmail service . The letter , dated November 5th , 1926 , reads in part : " I understand from the papers that Pilot Lindbergh duplicated his performance of last month by jumping and crashing one of your ships . Please furnish complete report as to whether Weather Bureau could have prevented this by furnishing the proper information , etc . " Attachedis a carbon of the reply : " It is true we lost another ship via the Lindbergh method as it were . This is quite an expensive experience for us and personally I feel it was the fault of bad judgment . However , if a weather report could have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been avoided . " ( Apparently , if you have a letter saying that Lindbergh used bad judgment , you have something . ) No. 631 is a pay check , made out to Charles A. Lindbergh . Date is 1927 , amount is $95.30 . It is marked " salary $87.50 , expense $7.80 . " ? SOCIAL Ne ? rE : Mrs. C. M. Travis , 1185 Park Avenue , has flooded her terrace for skating . The Joyces f-lr HE Giorgio Joyces have been liv-ing quietly in and around town since they arrived with their small son on the Bremen last May . Giorgio is the son of the famous James Joyce , but he has no prose work in progress him-self . He 's a bass singer . He made his radio debut in November as George Joyce , because he does n't like the name Giorgio  --  it was given to him because Italian was the language spoken in Trieste , where he was born m 1905 . He has sung twice on the radio so far ? a Mozart aria , a Tschaikowsky song , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wishing him luck . James , who started out to be a singer himself , is proud of Giorgio 's voice and hopes he will he a great concert singer some day . Giorgio wo n't talk about his father 's work , but he told us some interesting things about the author 's way of life , speaking with a slight accent . ( He lived in Trieste till he was nine , in Switzerland during the war , and has been in Paris since 1919 . He and his father always converse in Italian . ) James Joyce 's eyesight , his son says , is much Netter than it used to be , but he can see only with his left eye , the right being entirely blind . A few years ago he had to write with blue crayon on huge sheets of white paper , but now he uses pen or pencil on any paper that is handy . He can typewrite , using one finger on each hand , but uses a typewriter only for his infrequent correspondence , never for manuscripts . His friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretaries and has never hired one . His friends also read to him , out of dictionaries , encyclopedias , and other reference books . When he wants something read to him . for relaxation , he usually asks for Ibsen . He has never had a line of Gertrude Stein read to him and seems to have no interest in her work . The two have met , but that 's all . The only thing Joyce reads for himself is his " Work in Progress . " He reads parts of it aloud to his friends , chuckling now and then , going back and rereading sometimes passages he especially likes . He never reads from " Ulysses " or any other of his old works , being bored with them after they are written and published . Joyce sees very few people . He never goes to literary teas or other parties , but gives three a year himself  --  at Christmas , New Year 's , and on his birthday , February 2nd . Only his small circle of intimates are invited to these parties . Joyce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompaniment . His voice is tenor and his favorite song is " Molly Brannigan . " ( His son , incidentally , does n't play the piano . ) Joyce gets up around nine , writes a little , but spends most of the morning telephoning . He actually likes talking on the phone , and chins with his friends by the hour . Before lunch he plays and sings , and afterward works until five o'clock . He has been at his new hook for years ; nobody knows when it will be finished , but Giorgio thinks it 's about half done . After five , Joyce takes a walk , alone . He detests dogs and would n't walk with one . There are no pets at all in his household , which consists of himself , his wife ( who was Nora Barnacle ) , and his other child , Lucia . Joyce 's favorite restaurant in Paris is Fouquct 's . He likes the opera , the theatre ( never misses a Thursday matinee ) , song recitals , and even the movies . His favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard dozens of times . The only thing he drinks is white wine . At present he is in Zurich . Giorgio had a letter from him recently . It began " Dear Oigroig and Neleh . " That 's backward for Giorgio and Helen , the latter being Mrs. Oigroig . It ended " With much love , Obbab . " Obbab is backward for Bahho , which means Daddy in Italian . Babbo has been James Joyce 's family nickname for thirty years . Lyric ADEAR old , lady walking in Cen- tral Park last Friday saw , some distance ahead of her on the Mall , a group of little girls playing a game which she had played as a little girl . She remembered it perfectly . You bounced a ball on the pavement with one hand and swung your leg over it as it rebounded , then repeated the action with the other hand and other leg . All the while you sang a song that went like this : " One , two , three , a-fairy -- I spy Mrs. Sairy  --  sitting on a humble-airyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ball to this until you missed , then it was the next girl 's turn . Affected by a sweet nostalgia , the old lady approached the girls , determined to give them a dime for candy . As she neared the group , though , she became conscious of the words they were breathlessly chanting to the old , familiar tune : " Sally Rand has lost her fan  --  give it back , you nasty man ! " She put her dime right hack in her reticule and walked on , nostalgic no longer . Queer Map SEVERAL people , orally and by let- ter , told us we ought to take a look at the map of Manhattan on the bulletin hoard in the Pennsylvania Station , one man , a stranger in town , being rather bitter on the subject because he 'd headed for the Hotel Behnont. , on the map 's say-so and this had resulted in an argument with a cab-driver and the subsequent embarrassing revelation that the cab man knew what he was talking about , there no longer being a Hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the station with us and he later said he felt richly repaid . He was able to pick out many startling anachronisms . The map is on the east side of the train concourse , at your left as you enter from the general waiting-room . It lists , marginally , " One Hundred Points of Interest . " The Belmont is one , and the Century Theatre , long since gone to make room for an apartment house , is another . The first point of interest on the list is Aeolian Hall , still shown on Forty-second Street . Then there 's also the Waldorf-Astoria at Thirty-fourth Street , and the World and Tribune , side by side on Park Row , and the Herald on Herald Square . Tammany Hall is still shown as on Fourteenth Street . A little picture on the map portrays each point of interest , and the Park Avenue Hotel , long gone , looks quite attractive a block below the Vanderbilt . Some little cutout stickers have been pasted on to show a few new landmarks , such as the Chrysler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been pasted over the Waldorf-Astoria , but the Waldorf is still listed among the points of interest as at the old address , and the new Waldorf is n't mentioned in any way . Most of the points of interest , except for hotels and a few places like Fraunces ' Tavern and the Fulton Fish Market , seem to he churches , and here our landmark editor was helpful . We knew , of course , that there is no longer a Park Avenue Baptist Church , because it is now on Riverside Drive with its carillon , but it took our companion to tell us that the Central Presbyterian and First Baptist Churches are misplaced , as well as the De Witt Clinton High School and the Presbyterian Hospital . The homes of quite a number of prominent citizens are shown , and several of those listed , like Senator Clark and Thomas Fortune Ryan , are dead . The map is dated 1926 , and when our landmark editor noted this , he said , " Well , it shows how the town has changed in nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't account for some of the errors , though . It 's simply a remarkable map , and we ca n't explain it . Sister Elizabeth 's Eve ALATE-WANDERING cousin of ours , who for all his feathers was a-cold , gave chase the other night when the fire engines went by . It warmed his blood and made him feel like a boy again . The fire ( which was in the Knickerbocker Village district ) turned out better than he had hoped . It was in a convent  --  smoke and sparks coming from the chimney at a great rate . The firemen , their breaths rising steamily , rang the doorbell , rang and rang , stamped and banged . The convent was asleep . Time went on . Smoke and sparks rose . No lights came on . No one answered . Finally a neighborhood buff suggested that the firemen shout for Sister Elizabeth . " She 's on the fif ' floor . " The men looked at each other . They were a-cold . " Sound that siren again , God damn it ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a shriek . Then silence . Everybody looked aloft . Still no sign of life . " All right , " said the executive , " call her ! " The men looked at each other . " Sister Elizabeth ! Sister Elizz-abeth ! " " O.K. , do it louder , " said the captain . The chorus of voices ( rose and fell in the clear air . " Sister Elizabeth ! Sister Elizz-abeth ! Sister Elillabeth ! " In about a minute a head appeared at a top window . Sister Elizabeth looked as though she thought she was going to have to deal with a bunch of drunks . " Your chimney is on fire ! Come down and let us in ! " The head disappeared . The window slammed down . Another minute went by . Sister Elizabeth was dressing . Finally a light in the vestibule , and the men rushing up , and words through a grille , and the Sister shaking her head , then slowly yielding ... yielding . And our cousin , hailing a late cab , homeward hound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he walks along the street and then takes them home to ponder over has been brooding for several days about a sentence he overheard when he walked past two men on Fifth Avenue . One said to the other ( and then they were both gone out of our friend 's life forever ) , " I tell you , Bert , it was the opposite of a coincidence . " The feelers ) BACCO ROAD , " as you no doubt know , has been running longer than any other play now on Broadway . We were aware that it started off badly , but we did n't realize how badly until we talked with a man who gets backstage . At its first matinee , more than a year ago , only fifty people paid to get in ( three hundred others were given passes ) . During the whole first month of the show , only a few hundred persons paid at each performance . Now " Tobacco Road " is playing to packed houses , and they say that seats are selling as far ahead as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the play 's run has been $7,00C , and net profits have run to a little more than $200,000 . The play " opened cold " ? that is , without an out-of-town performance ? at the Masque Theatre on December 4th , 1933 . The critics were for the most part cautiously bewildered . The consensus was that the show was nasty , almost to the point of burlesque . Few came out and said that it was funny . Then Theodore Dreiser and Carl Van Doren went to see " Tobacco Road " ? and solemnly recommended it for the Pulitzer Prize ( which was later awarded to " Men in White " ) . Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt went to see it and apparently was amused , or enthralled , for she went back and saw it again . Percy Hammond wrote in a Sunday article that Henry Hull 's performance was the best he had seen in many years . The Daily News praised the play in an editorial . Harp ? Marx dropped in and thought it was very funny . Business began to pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terribly to play for one night the part of Grandma Lester , that of a bedraggled and ragged old hag . He actually rehearsed the role , but on the day he was to make his scheduled appearance he was called to Hollywood ? or said he was  --  leaving a lot of disgruntled and muttering reporters and photographers standing around . ( It is of Grandma Lester , who disappears one night , that her son Jeeter , when apprised of the fact that his mother has probably died somewhere near the place , says , " I 'll take a look ' round for her one of these days . " ) There have been three Jeeter Letters ( the main role ) . Henry Hull , the original one , got $250 a week and a percentage of the gross , which brought him in about $1,000 a week after the play really got going . He quit to go to Hollywood at $3,500 a week . James Barton , the next one ( who had never seen Hull in the r51e ) , got the same thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for $14,000 . James Bell , the third one , gets a straight salary of $300 a week , and he is still at it , although he , too , has received flattering movie offers . As for the others in the original cast , Dean Jaggers , who played Loy for about two months at $75 a week , is now gettingeight times that much in Hollywood . Patricia Quinn , the original Grandma Lester , gave way a few weeks ago to Dorothy Yockel ( we do n't know whether or not Miss Quinn went to Hollywood ) . There have been no other changes . The play was dramatized by Jack Kirkland from the novel by Erskine Caldwell , None of Kirkland 's friends thought the manuscript was any good , and neither did any of the producers who saw it , until it was handed to Anthony Brown . He decided to take a chance . Caldwell attended every performance for the first week , and approved the dramatization and Hull 's work . He and Kirkland and Brown decided that persistence would put the play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the play and its " love scenes " are bold and earthy , Mr. John Sumner has not been aroused into action against " Tobacco Road . " It seems , however , that Mr. Colborne , the anti-profanity man we wrote about recently , has decided to do something about the purple language if he can ever get in and hear it for himself . Each time he 's tried so far , the house has been sold out . He does n't like to stand . Competition ACOLD and lonely cop wander- ed into one of the most elegant art galleries in town one day last week and asked the lady in charge if he could stay there until his hands got warm . She said sure , go ahead . The cop walked around for a while , blowing on his hands and looking at the pictures . On his way out he thanked her , and remarked sympathetically , " I bet you 've lost a lot of your trade since the five-and-ten put in those twenty-cent etchings . "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
