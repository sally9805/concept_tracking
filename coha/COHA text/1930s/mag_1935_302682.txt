On the walls of the highly decorated Wildenstein Galleries in Manhattan last week hung a collection of 48 lush canvases , opulently framed , softly lit , richly varnished . Ten of them were mural studies of the Prophets of Israel . The rest were the latest crop of portraits of bigwigs by Britain 's Frank O. Salisbury , member of the Worshipful Company of Glaziers and favorite portraitist of George V. <P> Probably no living artist has painted quite so many kings , queens , tycoons and great ladies as small , bald , dynamic Philip de Laszlo . Yet for 20 years Glazier Salisbury has run him a close second on the strength of a pair of bristling eyebrows , an impressive forehead , a slick , completely artificial technique and a series of truly magnificent lavender cravats . <P> The Wildenstein show of portraiture by command was Mr. Salisbury 's first exhibit in the U. S. in six years . On view were Cardinal Hayes in his princely robes ; J. Pierpont Morgan looking royally severe ; the late Calvin Coolidge ( lent by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baker Sr. ( lent by U. S.

Other Salisbury sitters : Benito Mussolini , William Thompson Dewart ( New York <P> Sun ) , Herbert Lee Pratt ( Standard Oil ) , Edward Eugene Loomis , LL . D. ( Lehigh Valley Railroad ) , Edward Stephen Harkness , Mrs. Frank O. Salisbury . <P> A sickly child , Frank Salisbury was tutored privately , began to draw seriously when he was about 15 , in the studio of his elder brother , a designer of stained glass windows . He won scholarships at the Royal Academy art schools , traveled in Italy , Germany and France .

The picture was sold and two years later Frank Salisbury married Miss Greenwood . The portrait of the future Mrs. Salisbury won him a commission to do a portrait of Sir Joseph Gilbert which in turn brought him a commission from Sir Charles Lawes-Writtewronge . After that Frank Salisbury was made . Since then he has propped up his easel before so many of the world 's potentates , that it is difficult to understand why he has never been knighted or admitted to the Royal Academy . He has painted King George six times . <P> The late John Singer Sargent would occasionally mutter into his beard that " Portrait painting is a pimp 's profession ! " and go off to do his best work , loose inspired landscapes in watercolor . Frank O. Salisbury has little time for such relaxation . He is not only a court painter but a ceremonial painter , commissioned to record on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry VII 's chapel in Westminster Abbey ; The Official Picture of H. R. H.

He also still designs stained glass windows .
