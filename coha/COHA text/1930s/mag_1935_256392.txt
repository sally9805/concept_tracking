The fiery Wartime pacifism of James Ramsay MacDonald has long since mellowed into compromise . Compromise has made him Prime Minister of England , the King 's good friend and pet lion of the Marchioness of Londonderry . To the hard-headed Conservatives of the National Government , led in fact by Stanley Baldwin , mellow Scot MacDonald is an ideal figurehead , never more so than now as it faces an oncoming national election . MacDonald , however , is far from well . Over &; over the Conservatives have prepared the voters for MacDonald 's final fade-out by slipping out rumors that he was about to resign the Prime Ministership to Stanley Baldwin . Last week the chorus of rumors swelled , picked out a definite date , the Whitsuntide Holiday , June 9 . <P> Calling on the King in office hours is a portentous political thing in England . Last week nearly every member of the National Cabinet trooped through the gates of Buckingham Palace to talk to the heavy-eyed old man . First it was MacDonald and his Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also called . Later Scot MacDonald called again , then significantly turned his back on an emergency Cabinet meeting , went off to Scotland , leaving Baldwin to announce Britain 's bellicose new air program ( see col. 1 ) . Finally Ramsay MacDonald was back again at the palace gates and everybody knew that something was up . <P> The dopesters had only one sure fact : the Prime Minister 's eyes are failing from a lifetime of excessive reading . The Conservatives might not miss MacDonald 's eyes but they would certainly miss his much-publicized heart . British dopesters were busy last week figuring that , if MacDonald resigned , he would take with him the weak men in the National Cabinet . This meant two in particular : Sir John Simon whose Olympian coldness in human contacts had not served Britain well in foreign affairs ; and the Marquess of Londonderry , Air Minister , who should have known that Germany was building an air fleet .
