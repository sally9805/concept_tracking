txt With the opening of Congress approaching , both President Hoover and the leaders of both major parties were engaged today in preparing for the coming session . The President started the actual draft of his annual message which , ' above all else , will contain the administration 's program for meeting the economic crisis and averting the possibility of outright Federal appropriations to aid the unemployed . Discussion of a Democratic legislative program that will reflect the party 's attitude in the 1932 campaign was begun by Representative John N. Garner and Senator Pat Harrison of Mississippi , ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee . The President for weeks has been making notes on the annual message and is anxious to get it out of the way so that he may bend his energies toward formulating his budget recommendations which , to use his words , will be of " equal importance " to his general legislative requests because of the continual growth of the treasury deficit , now threatening to exceed $2,000,000,000 for the current fiscal year . Spends Day on Message . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devote practically all of the next week or so to drafting the message to . Congress . Today he shut himself in the Lincoln study and remained there most of the day . He spent only a few minutes in the executive offices , conferring there with Eugene Meyer , Governor of the Federal Reserve Beard , and Colonel J. Clawson Roop , Director of the Budget . The message is expected by the President 's friends to embody one of the most far-reaching programs for economic relief that has ever been laid before Congress by the nation 's Executive . First , there will be the recommendation for a year 's moratorium in inter-governmental reparations and war debts , already in effect , and to which the party leaders in Congress agreed , pending formal ratification . Next will be recommendations for legislation necessary to put into full force measures for stimulating bank credits , including the National Credit Corporation , and for the creation of a system of home loan mortgage banks to revive residential construction . Expected Proposals . The legislative measures which the President has indicated he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will deal chiefly with the eligibility rules of the Federal Reserve act . The belief persists that he purposes to ask Congress to make commercial paper not eligible under the provisions of the Federal Reserve act a " prime security " at the Federal Reserve banks under certain conditions and in certain times . Some circles think he may propose that real estate mortgage bonds and railroad securities of certain classes be made " prime securities . " The President has said that he would recommend , if necessary , the creation of a finance corporation similar in character and purpose to the War Finance Board to supplement the National Credit Corporation and also the subscription by the government of further capital stock to the Federal land banks so that farmers might obtain more and easier credit facilities . The message is expected to veer away from further general farm relief at this time , and to propose a continuation of the Federal Farra Board without further appropriations for stabilization operations . According to friends of the administration , the message will steer completely clear of prohibition . Reference to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " under that agency preferable to any sort of outright Federal assistance is looked for . Mr. Hoover has given no indication of what he will suggest as a cure for the ailing budget , further than the departmental economies he has been pressing . He has deferred formulating a tax policy , indicating that the door had been left open for possible revision . A decision on this subject must be reached before he starts drafting the budget message . Some high officials and leaders of Congress close to the President favor a selective sales tax . Confer on Tariff Stand . The exchange of views between Mr. Garner and Mr. Harrison , the former slated for the speakership if the Democrats organize the House and the latter a dominant figure in tariff and revenue matters in the Senate , was preliminary to a general conference of Democratic leaders to be held next week upon the arrival of Senator Robinson , the Democratic Senate floor leader . While neither of the ' , conferees would indicate the trend of their conversation it , is known that Senator Harrison , representing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considers the advantages of avoiding advocacy of wholesale revision of the tariff . He is represented as voicing the views of tlye Raskob-Smith faction on legislation and stands with that element except in its opposition to the Eighteenth Amendment . Representative Garner believes that the party should present measures to decrease the budget deficit and modify the Hawley-Smoot tariff act . Mr. earner made it clear that he does not intend to force his personal views , but , so far as consistent , would chart his course by the party 's position as expressed in the coming conferences . He reiterated that there would be no truce with the administration , so far as accepting unqualifiedly measures recommended by the President is concerned . If cooperation is sought by the administration , Mr. Garner held that there should be reciprocity and that the Democrats should have a hand in framing legislation . As the result of informal talks among Congressional leaders and those high in the councils of the Democratic party , it is indicated that the Ways and Means Committee may report bills for revising schedules in the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glaring inequalities . " According to the opinion expressed by several leading Democrats , the party has so sharply criticized the law that it is incumbent on it to seek reductions in rates that are alleged to bear heavily on the masses . Those who favor some revision are said to believe that reduction of the sugar schedule and the rates on aluminum in several of the very high ad valorem duties should be attempted at the coming session , but that general revision should be deferred until after the Presidential election and until the tariff attitude of Great Britain is known . Conservatives Against Revision . Democrats who are opposed to tinkering with the tariff hold that any efforts at revision would be only a gesture , as even if the Senate passed necessary bills , they probably would meet with a Presidential veto . They also believe that If the tariff is opened up at the coming session there would be such a flood of demands for changes as greatly to embarrass the party in a Presidential year . Enough trouble along that line is already apparent , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These foresee , it is said , that the West , where the Democrats hope to make gains in the 1932 elections , would seek a tariff on oil and copper . Mr. Garner agreed today that a program that will appeal to thinking voters is the most difficult problem before the party that apparently has gained control of the House . He indicated that he did not expect to encounter any trouble as to agreement on a Northern man for floor leader or the assignment of committee places In such a way as to give Northern Democrats some positions of importance . While the seniority succession rule will not be violated , a number of Southern Democrats are said to be willing to give way in a harmony deal . Hope of harmony is due to the attitude of New York Democrats who are reported as being willing to forego a contest for the floor leadership and be satisfied with the chairmanships that naturally will come to them under the seniority rule .                  @ @ @
