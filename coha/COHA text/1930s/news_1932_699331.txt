txt In his annual message to Congress yesterday President HOOVER had nothing unexpected or startling to say . He did say several reassuring and hopeful things . Admitting the need of exceptional means to relieve distress this Winter , Mr. HOOVER is confident that the measures taken by the Federal Government and by States and municipalities , supplemented by the splendid " sense of humanity " displayed by private citizens everywhere and by cooperative and volunteer organizations , make it sure that there will be " no " hunger or suffering from cold in " the country . " The President is also heartened by the fact that the public health has been maintained at a high level . He still believes in the strength of American institutions , as witnessed anew by the fact that the national election through which we have just passed was tranquil and followed by " acceptance of its results . " When a party has been beaten by 6,000,000 , what is there for it to do but accept the results ? The message , as a whole , is the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are in a period of chronic deficits . Public revenues continue to fall short of the estimates and of the urgent needs of the Treasury . There is nothing for it but to practice the most stringent economy , and to submit to new taxes . Mr. ** intimates that his budget will show reduced appropriations of about $600,000,000 . Congress will have something to say about this . Before it gets through , the saving may not be so great as the President hopes for . Even if it is , he does not shut his eyes to the fact that the Government must somehow enlarge its income . To that end he proposes that the special manufacturers ' excise taxes should be " extended to cover prac " tically all manufactures at a uni " form rate , except necessary ' food " ' and possibly some grades of cloth ' ing . " But an increased revenue from that source will not dispense with the need of the most rigid retrenchment . Mr. HOOVER announces that he will soon issue Executive orders calling for a new grouping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrative agen " cies . " These orders will , by act of Congress , have to be submitted for Congressional approval , and will not become effective until after sixty days , unless the Congress should earlier approve them . By far the longest and most urgent passage in the President 's message is the one demanding a radical reform in our banking system . It notably failed to stand up and function in our recent financial troubles . Mr. HOOVER enumerates the long and melancholy list of our bank failures during the past two years , by contrast with the fact that banking in Great Britain and in Canada , although those countries suffered shocks as severe as our own , reported scarcely any failures . The President is fully of the mind of many economists and bankers that there should be a drastic reorganization of our banking methods . What form it should take he does not say . Perhaps he is leaving it to the Secretary of the Treasury to indicate what ought to be done . In international affairs Mr. Ho0-'VER is no apostle of aloofness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duty and advantage of cooperating with foreign nations in many measures . He specifies the Disarmament Conference , and expresses ardent hope that successful results may come from the World Economic Conference in which we are to participate . All this is left rather in the vague , as doubtless it must be at present . The President makes no positive recommendations about the war debts . It is understood that this subject he will later take up in a special message to Congress . For the present , he contents himself with repeating that our Government expects the European debtcrs to pay the instalment due on Dec. 15 , though he still expects to urge Congress to approve " methods " to overcome temporary exchange difficulties in connection with this " pay-rnent . " The message has the merit of being short and clear . That it is not inspiring may be due to the fact that the financial situation is not exactly exhilarating , and that the President himself is somewhat tired and discouraged . He has , nevertheless , said what is necessary and to the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to heart and does as well in action as Mr. HOOVER has done in recommendation .
