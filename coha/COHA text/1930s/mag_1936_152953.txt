In the Department of Agriculture Dr. Mordecai Joseph Brill Ezekiel stands for pure intellect . Mild mannered , younger looking than his 36 years , he sits in a large office and thinks . In his mind , apt in higher mathematics , are formulated many of the more abstract ideas found in the speeches of Henry Agard Wallace , for Dr. Ezekiel is Economic Adviser to the Secretary of Agriculture . From this mind came last week a project which should make Dr. Francis Everett ( " $200 per month " ) Townsend look to his reputation as an innovator of social security . Not only did Dr. Ezekiel propose a monthly income $8.33 higher than did Dr. Townsend , but he proposed it as the minimum income , not for oldsters alone but for every family in the U. S. <P> The Ezekiel proposal , published in book form with the title $2,500 a Year* gave little comfort to Townsendites . As a theorist Dr. Ezekiel can think circles around Dr. Townsend , and he devoted but three pages to a systematic demolition of his rival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own plans . He proposed no guaranteed bounty for idle pensioners but a better ordered economic society in which even the poorest could earn a living some 60% better than the average U. S. citizen . <P> The Means . To accomplish this Dr. Ezekiel saw that planning would be necessary . Boards would have to be set up in each industry to see how much it could produce . These figures would have to be adjusted to the public demand for each industry 's goods . Wages would have to be adjusted up and prices down so that the number of dollars in the public 's pockets would equal the value of all goods produced . That such a national blueprint of abundance could be drafted and carried out by voluntary agreement of industry , Dr. Ezekiel doubted . That it could be done even if the Government promised to buy up all surplus goods which industry could not sell , he also doubted . He thought his plan possible if the Government set up yardstick factories in every industry to pace private business with competition - possible but politically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to set up a great Industrial Adjustment Board to make contracts with corporations as AAA once did with farmers . These contracts would specify how much each plant should produce , how many workers they should employ , how high wages should be . what prices should be charged . For fulfilling these contracts each business would receive benefits ( like AAA benefits ) paid for by production taxes ( like processing taxes ) .
