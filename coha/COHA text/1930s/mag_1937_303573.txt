COLLECTED POEMS-James Joyce-Viking ( $2 ) . <P> Last week U. S. booksellers might well have lined their window-displays with a border of shamrocks . Novelist-of-the-week was Liam O'Flaherty ( see col. 3 ) ; and for the first time since the U. S. publication of Ulysses ( 1934 ) , famed James Joyce had brought out a book . <P> When , in Ulysses , James Joyce succeeded in crowding pre-War Dublin piecemeal through the eye of a verbal needle , he was hailed as the largest literary giant Ireland had ever produced . Seeing a giant , however , is not necessarily believing in him : and Ulysses ' gigantic size seemed , to some critics and many lay readers , to conceal a wizened point of view . Readers who are cajoled into the belief that all is big in Brobdignag will find Giant Joyce 's Collected Poems an eye opener . For not only are his poems measly in number ( 50 ) , they seem small potatoes-and with few eyes in them at that . <P> The largest parcel of the collection consists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1907 . In this sequence of lyrics 25-year-old Joyce gave his version of love 's old sweet song . Among apple trees and amid green woods , far removed from the bleeding tarts and coal-quay whores of Ulysses ' Dublin , the young lover sings the praises of his " dove , " his " beautiful one " - half angel , half virgin ; he finally persuades her to undo the snood ' ' that is the sign of maidenhood " ; and ends up in the classic predicament of all lyric lovers : starkly sitting on his bottom , all alone . A genius at mimicry . Joyce succeeds in imparting a flavor of old-fashioned purity to his verses ; but behind this not entirely insincere faade the reader can sense , and sometimes see , his peculiarly Irish irreverence ; <P> What counsel has the hooded moon Put in thy heart , my shyly sweet , Of love in ancient plenilune , Glory and stars beneath his feet- A sage that is but kith and kin With the comedian Capuchin ? <P> Joyce 's post-Ulyssean prose style is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Work in Progress ) which by some are highly touted as a significant experiment , seem to others merely words in a helter-skelter retreat from significance . Joyce himself used them sparingly in Pomes Penyeach ( 1927 ) , eschews them entirely in Ecce Puer ( 1936 ) , his single four-quatrain poem written during the last decade . His later poems , which in general hew to the line of modern Irish minor verse , in their essential scope are no advance over his earlier pseudo-madrigals . All arise from and express similar , unimportant sensations : casual pangs felt by a sensitive nature in the clutch of existence . <P> All day I hear the noise of waters Making moan . Sad as the seabird is , when going Forth alone He hears the winds cry to the waters ' Monotone . <P> Of those non-casual , nonpersonal pangs , familiar to all true poets , there is in these poems just enough of a trace to reassure readers that this giant is a human giant after all .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
