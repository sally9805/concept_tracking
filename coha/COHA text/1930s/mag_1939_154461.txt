Rhode Island 's scholarly , libertarian Senator Theodore Francis Green last week returned to Washington with a warm appreciation of tropic hospitality . Along with New York 's Republican Representative Hamilton Fish and Democratic Representative Matthew Merritt , Democrat Green was the guest last fortnight of the Dominican Republic 's Generalissimo Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina . In Ciudad Trujillo ( the General 's new name for the venerable city of Santo Domingo ) , the U. S. delegation looked upon 1 ) a box ( which remained unopened ) containing a tiny heap of bone &; dust billed as the true " last parts " of Christopher Columbus , and 2 ) the charm of Trujillo , who wants to improve his press relations in the U. S. <P> Among other claimants to the remains of the Great Discoverer are Seville , Spain , and Genoa , Italy . Many historians now agree with Trujillo that Seville 's claims have been severely shaken . To Genoa 's claims , little attention is paid . In company with Mrs. Fish and the Fish 's 13-year-old son , Hammy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congressmen were feted , shown about spick &; span Ciudad Trujillo , finally were invited to the Cathedral to view their host 's Columbian relics . <P> The visitors saw a 9 by 9 by 16 in. leaden casket , graven with abbreviations unmistakably referring to " Cristoval Colon , Almirante " ( see cut ) . Inside it when last opened were once-human bone &; dust , a bullet presumably fired into Columbus during some fracas before he sailed for the New World . <P> Official purpose of the display was to promote an international memorial to Christopher Columbus . In the Dominican Republic , people seldom speak of Trujillo by name . When they discuss their savior , they find it safer to refer to the local equivalent of " Mr. Jones " ( as do Benito Mussolini 's subjects ) . But when Senator Green &; companions got home last week , it became clear that Trujillo had also done himself a good turn . Mr. Green regaled his acquaintances with accounts of the seven hospitals , the sanitation , the orderly well-being apparent in Ciudad Trujillo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded that Trujillo was a wonderful fellow , that bootblacks wiped his guests ' shoes for nothing and collected later from the dictator .
