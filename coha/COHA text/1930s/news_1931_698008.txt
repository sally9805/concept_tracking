txt Net profit of National Dairy Products Corp . for the first half of 1931 was in the neighborhood of $1.80 a share on the 6,202.177 shares of common stock now outstanding . This compares with net of $12,947,211 or $2.16 a share on 5. - 971,036 common shares in the first half of 1930 . For the full year 1930 net profit was $26,387,376 or $4.10 a share on 6,202,177 common shares . Earnings thus are holding up comparatively well in view of the generally lower rate of business prevailing . Normally , National Dairy earns the largest part of its annual profits in the last six months which include the summer ice cream business . In the first half of 1930 the dairy business showed little effect from the Industrial unsettlement , though the final six months did . Sales volume so far this year has been about 10% behind the 1930 period for the corresponding units . June business , however , was somewhat ahead of last yeas , and July has continued the gain with the countrywide hot weather giving its usual stimulus to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dairy business has been somewhat unsettled lately by sporadic price cutting . A sharp reduction of 25% was recently announced in the price of bottled cream , to 18 cents pint against the former level of 24 cents . This was directly due to large surplus supplies of butter fat overhanging the market which forced down the price of fat as well as of butter . As a result butter factories found it more profitable to sell the cream directly at retail through small dealers instead of as butter . In order to meet this competition the large dairy companies were obliged to reduce their prices . So far there is no indication that this price cutting will spread to milk and ice cream on any extensive scale , although in some districts there has been some slashing in ice cream prices by the smaller dealers . however , National Dairy sells its ice cream to an established trade under its own brand on the basis of quality , and thus any general price cut in this division is regarded as unlikely There already is some indication that hot dry weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clear up the surplus of butter fat by reducing production . Cash Position Continues Strong National continues in its usual strong cash position with a total of more than $19,000,000 cash on hand against $19,886,012 as of December 31 , 1930 . This large balance was maintained throughout last year in spite of heavy expdiaditures for acquisition of new subsidiaries . So far this year only a few minor purchases have been made , and no further important additions arc likely for the time being , although the purchase of small units in desirable territory probably will continue . Thus , cash on hand may show an increase by the end of this year , taking into account the substantial surplus after dividend payments , and the reserves set aside for depreciation out of earnings . In 1930 , more than $10,000,000 was carried to surplus from earnings after payment of preferred and common dividends , and $10,060,422 was set aside for depreciation in addition to the expenditure of $10,910,619 for repairs and maintenance . There are $79,380.500 53 , ; % gold debentures outstanding upon which interest requirements total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $30,374,214 in 1930 so that fixed charges were earned more than seven times in that year , and are being covered by nearly as large a margin in 1931 . The debentures are selling currently around 102 . National Dairy Products Corp . has withdrawn its provisional offer for the acquisition of the assets of the Golden State Co. , Ltd . T. H. , presi6ent of National Dairy , stated that this action was taken not because of any adverse developments in the financial position or business of the Gold State Co. , Ltd. , in ordinary course but because of certain other developments in that company and the litigation attendant therewith , which were unforeseen at the time the agreement was made by the directors of the two corporations and which have made it inexpedient to proceed with the acquisition .
