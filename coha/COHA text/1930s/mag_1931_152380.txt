A busy little bee is Editor Peter Vischer of Polo , which Harper &; Bros , bought from Publisher Martin Quigley last spring and dressed up for the International Matches ( TIME , May 19 ) . Last week Polo was sold again , to a group of Editor Vischer 's polo-playing friends who agree with him 1 ) that Polo should be purely horsey , not social ; 2 ) that smartly published horsiness will pay . Editor Vischer will now run Polo solo , assisted by a learned " advisory council " and with contributions as before from wise young Robert F. Kelley of the New York Times , famed Horse Artist Paul Brown . Reading with even deeper interest , expecting to collect dividends , will be Editor Vischer 's investing friends , who include John Hay ( " Jock " ) Whitney , A. Charles Schwartz , <P> W. Averell Harriman , Seymour H. Knox , John Hertz , Victor Emanuel , W. Holden White , John M. Schiff , James A. Farrell Jr. , W. H. Nichols .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
