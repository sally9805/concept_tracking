A nine-by-twelve-foot canvas of five loosely sketched , bright pink nudes swinging in a wild dance across emerald green grass under a vivid blue sky hung last week on the walls of Manhattan Art Dealer Pierre Matisse , flanked by a group of photographs and autograph letters . Bewildering to the cautious mind , the canvas was of first importance to the U. S. art world for it was a full-size preliminary sketch for La Danse , the most famed mural decoration that Dealer Matisse 's father , bearded Henri Matisse , ever did . Few U. S. art lovers have ever seen the original . With its companion piece , La Musique , another arrangement of pink nudes on green grass , it is one of the chief treasures of Moscow 's Museum of Modern Western Art . <P> The son of a solid wheat dealer of northern France , Artist Matisse dutifully began life as a lawyer 's apprentice , was forced to give up his law studies when a severe attack of appendicitis left him an invalid for many months . Painting was suggested to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he never opened a law book again . <P> Never one to starve unnecessarily , Henri Matisse discovered that an art student could make a fair living as a museum copyist . For ten years , while his own painting swung further and further to the Left , while his interest in oriental art-Persian miniatures in particular - grew by leaps &; bounds , he worked for the Government making microscopically exact copies of the great paintings in the Louvre for private collectors and provincial museums . By 1906 Artist Matisse , still youthful , but bearded as he is today , had given up copying , was the leader of an insurgent group of painters who were derisively called Les Fauves ( Wild Beasts ) . * Outraging conservatives , they acquired much publicity but few customers . To Paris from Russia , three years prior , had come one Serge Stchoukine , an immensely wealthy Muscovite whose fortune came from importing the one luxury that rag-wrapped moujiks would not do without : tea . Tea Tycoon Stchoukine had bought the 18th Century Troubetzkoy Palace , filled its rococo halls with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instinctive appreciation of what the younger French artists were trying to do . In Paris he bought the Fayet collection of Gauguins outright , bought one canvas from Henri Matisse . He liked it . In 1906 he was back in Paris for more Matisse pictures , but his walls were getting so crowded that he insisted they must be painted to certain specified sizes . Three years later Teaman Stchoukine was still convinced that Henri Matisse was a fine painter , gave him carte blanche to decorate the grand staircase of his palace . In his narrow knickerbockers and high laced shoes , Artist Matisse frequented at that time the Moulin Rouge and the Moulin de la Galette , contemplating the dancing cocottes that lame Toulouse-Lautrec had painted so shrewdly a few years earlier . Artist Matisse felt that the farandole , a sort of strumpets ' ring-around-a-rosy popular at both music halls , would be a suitable subject for the grand staircase of a Moscow bourgeois , and that is what he sent to his patron , reduced to simplest terms of nude figures and primitive colors.  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
