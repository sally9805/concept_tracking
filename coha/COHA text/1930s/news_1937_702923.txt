txt Addressing three meetings in Brooklyn last night ; Mayor La Guardia attacked Frank . V. Kelly , Democratic county leader , and District Attorney William F. X. Geoghan , promised to give Kings County " another Dewey " to stop racketeering and declared that the " Red " campaign of Jeremiah T. Mahoney , his Democratic opponent , was a clear sign that Mr. Mahoney had , become panicky . The Mayor was enthusiastically received . The rallies were held at Bay Ridge High School , Erasmus Hall High School and the William J. Gaynor Junior High School . The latter , a WPA project , was described by the Mayor as " my child . " At the Bay Ridge High School the Mayor denied that the American Labor party , as charged by Mr. Mahoney , was in any way Communistic , and pointed out that it was the same party that supported President Roosevelt and Governor Lehman a year ago . The Mayor took as his text a reference of the chairman , former Representative Harry Hanbury , to Mr. Mahoney 's characterization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red statements always happen when a candidate becomes panicky , " , the Mayor said . " But the prize statement came last night when the Democratic candidate said that the American Labor party was communistic and that its chairman was a Communist and intended to start a revolution . " " No Communist " in 1938 This brought a laugh from the audience and the Mayor continued : " I did not organize the American Labor party . Mr. Mahoney 's party organized it . It was organized in 1936 and its candidates were Franklin D. Roosevelt and Herbert Lehman . It had the same chairman then . He was no Communist then . " The same cry that was made against Mr. Roosevelt was made against me . Z. do n't think it worked then and it wo n't work now . " Mayor La Guardia said that Mr. Mahoney 's attack on the American Labor party and its chairman was embarrassing to persons in his own party . " I do n't have to prove that the American Labor party is not communistic , " the Mayor added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not . " The Mayor declared that the members of . the Democratic party in the city now realized that their plight was hopeless . " The boys , " he said , were getting irritable because they were hungry . Tells of Racket Drives In appealing for a sympathetic majority in the Board of Estimate , the Mayor managed to link this question with his and Thomas E. Dewey 's drive on rackets . Speaking of Controller Frank J. Taylor , his principal opponent in the board , the Mayor said : " Would Taylor vote for an appropriation for another Dewey for Brooklyn ? No . Frank Kelly would n't let him . " The Mayor repeated his pledge , made earlier in the campaign , to have another Dewey assigned to clean up rackets in Brooklyn , if the money is available after Jan. 1 . He again declared that Mr. Dewey 's investigation in Manhattan had driven racketeers to Brooklyn . " Just imagine , " he said , " the boys are getting hopeful of the rackets ' coming back and even that Lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own activities in cleaning up various rackets within the city government and said : " I cleaned them all up and they are sore at me . Some of them are working for an honest living now and they do n't like it . " Speaking of the activities of the Brooklyn District Attorney 's office , the Mayor said : " Mr. Geoghan got an appropriation from the Board of Estimate to fight rackets . Did you ever hear of any one indicted ? Did you ever hear of any one convicted ? No .
