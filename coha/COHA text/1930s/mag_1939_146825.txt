One of the few truly representative national competitions in U. S. athletics is the National Amateur Golf championship . This year , in its 28 sectional qualifying tournaments , 831 silver-spoon and rusty-putter golfers in all corners of the U. S. strove for the 171 places in last week 's entry list at Chicago 's North Shore Country Club . The National itself is one of the toughest grinds going-two qualifying rounds of medal play to cut the field to 64 , four rounds of 18-hole match play to determine the semifinalists , then 36-hole semifinal and final matches . Bobby Jones , who won it five times , used to call the National Amateur a nightmare . One flubbed iron , one balky putt , and the ruling champion often finds himself among the spectators . <P> Last week , after the second 18-hole round , on the sidelines were the great Johnny Goodman , who has also won the National Open ( 1933 ) , Willie Turnesa , 1938 Amateur champion , many other top-flights . Still in stride , however , among the 16 survivors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golf 's handsome , glamorous , 25-year-old Cinderella Man , who got a toehold on golf fame in 1935 by driving to swank Winged Foot on the Sound in a $7 jalopy to win the New York State title ; and 2 ) 26-year-old , icy-veined Marvin ( " Bud " ) Ward , of Spokane , a golfers ' golfer . Three years ago nobody had ever heard of him . Two years ago he lost to Johnny Goodman , one down , in the National Amateur semifinals , made the 1938 Walker Cup team on the strength of that . The U. S. lost the Walker Cup , but it was not Bud 's fault . He won his match , against English Champion Frank Pennink , by the unheard-of margin of 12 up . This spring he lambasted most of the pros in the business in the National Open , got upset when one of his iron shots cold-cocked a spectator , missed the big triple tie for first place by one stroke . Before last week 's play started , 15 of 17 New York aspirants thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure enough , the finalists were Billows and Ward . For his 92 holes of match play that far , Billows was nine under par . Ward had-played 103 holes , was 12 under . In the semifinal , Ward had shot three birdies and an eagle right in a row . Against this , Chicago 's Art Doering got three pars and a birdie , could not win a hole . <P> In the final , Ward took the first nine one up , was four up at the end of the first 18 . Billows had him even only once , on the eighth . In the afternoon round , Ward blazed through the first nine to become seven up . On the 13th , with five holes to play , he was still seven up and national champion . Ward hits super-lengthy drives , on-in-two brassies , crisp irons , but the answer to last week 's feat lay in his putter . In the 66 holes he had to play in the last two rounds , he one-putted 29 greens , three-putted only once .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
