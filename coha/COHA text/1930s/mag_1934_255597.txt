Figuring that some stronger man must be behind a leader who looks like Adolf Hitler , groping feature writers have for months been serving up Steel Tycoon Fritz Thyssen ( pronounced Tissen ) as the shrewd Macenas who " bought " the Nazis when they were poor , the Master Mind of National Socialism . <P> Just how Herr Thyssen could retain his purchased grip , once the Nazis had all Germany at their mercy , few gropers have tried to explain . Great was their perturbation last week as Tycoon Thyssen popped up at Buenos Aires , 5,900 miles from Berlin . <P> The whole Thyssen legend trembled . Eminent Groper Johannes Steel , author of The Second World War and dopester on Nazidom for Manhattan 's Post , clarioned : " Fritz Thyssen is taking his money out of Germany . Thyssen , Germany 's lord and master , has no confidence any more in Germany . . . . The exact amount of the capital which he managed to get out of Germany is not known , but it is certain to be no small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America are being formed . " <P> Lord &; Master Thyssen , with his wife and daughter , meanwhile faced Brazilian reporters in his suite aboard the German liner Caparcona . " I have relatives in Argentina and I am sailing on to see them " said he . " I need a rest . Reports that I left Germany because I feared an outbreak of violence are absolutely without foundation . I need a vacation as much as anyone else . "
