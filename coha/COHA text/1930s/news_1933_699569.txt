txt The long-waited reform of the American banking system is under way . So rapidly is It coming that Incredulous observers are rubbing their eyes . Opposition to a unified banking system has been intense . Prejudice against it has been so bitter that even Senator Carter Glass 813. ) of Virginia , its friend , did not believe It could be achieved for generations . And yet , today , under semi-dictatorial powers of the President , the United States has a unified bank system .. Then , there Is the question of divorcing banks from investment affiliates . When Mr. Glass proposed a modest step in this direction last year , after two years of testimony-taking by his Senate committee , a roar of opposition went up , chiefly from Wall Street . It would take years to achieve this reform , it was said . And yet , such is ? the rush to new ideas stimulated by the banking crisis , that hardly a day now passes without some new and powerful voice being raised in favor of the step , right in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The revelations of the activity of the National City Bank and its affiliate , the National City Company , before the Norbeck Senate Committee had something to do with it . The present banking crisis has even more . It has led to the resignation of Mr. Charles E. Mitchell from the National City Bank . It has led to the forthcoming separation of the bank from the National City Company . And now Mr. Winthrop W. Aldrloh , chairman of the Chase National Bank , ingest in the wand . announces Its forthcoming . separation from the Chase Securities Corporation , security aMllate , which is the largest thing of its kind In the world , too . Old observers have a right to rub their eyes . Furthermore , Mr. Aldrich , who speaks for the Rockefeller Interests , has moved so completely over to the Glass side that he says the pending Glass bill goes nowhere near far enough . That is making the Irascible but well-beloved senior Senator from Virginia rub his eyes , too . Represents Rockefeller Interests Mr. Aldrich , brother-In-law of John D. Rockefeller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banking out of the Investment field altogether , disrupt the directorate of nearly every %la New York bank , shear the Morgan interests and similar sowerful groups of private bankers from their control over some of the largest commercial banks of New York , and , bring American banking practice into line with more conservative European practice . Such ' a series of propogals would have caused anyone making them to be branded as an " Idle visionary " up to three weeks ago . Today they are put forward by one of the richest men in the country . Signs of New Order The Aldrich proposals are only one of the signs of the new times . Rarely has the nubile been so stirred for bank reforms . Now a " unified " banking system has been established by presidential edict . and It Is not likely to be removed when the crisis Is over . Loss of confidence in banks has done more than anything to prolong the United States business slump . Again and again in the past three years bank . failures have strangled efforts at recovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1929 intensified it . Control Loosely Held in me past 11 years some 10,000 United States banks have closed  --  one out of every three . In that time not a bank in Canada or England has failed . One trouble with American banks was the fact that there were 49 different systems of control , one in each state , and one in the Federal Government . Unity was needed and temporarily , unity has been , achieved . U the Federal Government is given control and permitted to ptit drastic rules and regulations round all commercial bank management , the banks that they finally permit to open can be made sound In a way that banks in the country have never been sound before . The Roosevelt Administration appears prepared at first to . open up o the 100 per cent solvent banks This is a drastic restriction but the time had to come sooner or later , for the wringing out of weak banks The latter may open up after a while , or they may be Absorbed by other banks ; in any ease , lir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually get their money . But if recovery ir to Je achieVed , the feeling is that the devastating effect of further bask suspensions must be stopp3d ; that the whole system of United States bank standards must be raised ; that , in fact , reform is at hand .
