Only last year short , swart Senor Don Carlos Guillermo Davila , potent Chilean publisher , was hobnobbing in Washington with President Hoover and many another man of property . Senor Davila , as Chilean Ambassador and a leading negotiator in setting up the Chilean-U . S. nitrate trust ( Cosach ) , looked and acted as though he would be the last man on earth to propose State Socialism . Last week he suddenly proposed it to the Chilean people in a bulky manifesto of 20,000 words , was accused of wanting to make himself President by a coup d ' tat . <P> Senor Davila ceased to be Ambassador and returned to Santiago when the Chilean Government of President Carlos Ibanez was upset by a coup d ' tat ( TIME , Aug 3 ) . Last week the new government of President Agustin Justo tried to suppress the Davila manifesto , stigmatized it as revolutionary . Senor Davila , who thought it best to quit his handsome home and go into hiding , declared in his manifesto , " Present conditions in Chile warrant a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we can adopt the useful residue of the French revolution , to mold our primitive political system , without taking a Bastille , without decapitating a king , without bloody tribunals , has not the moment arrived to try what demonstrates itself to be utilizable , without having to march on Rome , and without the ten years of suffering experienced by the Russian people ? <P> " At this moment the Chilean Government can step in and take over all means of production and distribution without stepping outside the bounds laid down by the present Chilean Constitution . I urge that Chilean people adopt Socialism without Revolution . "
