The Merchant of Yonkers ( by Thornton Wilder ; produced by Herman Shumlin ) is Thornton Wilder on a lark . The play , like the word , is rather out-of-date : Wilder has rewritten an old Viennese farce with no thought of streamlining it . The scene of The Merchant of Yonkers is Manhattan in the ' 80s. but old as the European theatre is the plot of the sweated apprentices who sneak off for a holiday , of their miserly old master ( Percy Waram ) on the hunt for a wife , and of the obliging Mrs. Fixit ( Jane Cowl ) who fixes things to suit herself . The slapstick is the same that , 200 years ago . drew tears of laughter from simple London cits and beefy German burghers : mistaken identity , boys dressed up as girls , people hiding under tables , lurking in clothes presses , listening behind screens , popping out of trap doors . <P> All this , in the old days lusty , ingenious , scatterbrained . Wilder seeks to recapture in a period spoof that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock characters and classic antics with quaintness and whimsical fancy . At his best , he gives The Merchant of Yonkers the nostalgia as well as the noise of an oldfashioned German street band . Where most modern farces have a hard , alcoholic hilarity , The Merchant of Yonkers for two acts romps and lets fly with all the innocence of a pillow fight . One of the best casts of the season throws the pillows for all they are worth . <P> Unfortunately in the last two acts the careless laughter begins to sound more like an old maid 's skittish giggle . The characters become a little giddy , the author turns a little cute , the plot turns a little silly , and Director Max Reinhardt 's German sense of gaiety turns alarmingly roguish . But the wonder is not that Wilder 's old horse finally breaks down . The wonder is that it trots so gaily , canters so jauntily , for as long as it does . <P> Everywhere I Roam ( by Arnold Sundgaard &; Marc Connelly ; produced by Marc Connelly &; Bela @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins 100 years ago in a sort of prairie Garden of Eden . The toiling farmer drips with honest sweat , his steadfast wife brings him cool water from the spring , and Johnny Appleseed moseys by , planting apple trees . <P> Then the serpent enters the Garden : the harvesting machine is invented , the rail-road arrives , sinister-looking capitalists in plug hats turn up . Years pass ; the farmer prospers , the rascally capitalists wax fat , the nation 's fibre is weakened . Then comes 1929 : the gorged capitalists expire of a gut-ache , the farmer is ruined and goes back to plowing . <P> There are good folk-dancing and singing in Everywhere I Roam , and fine pictorial moments . But the play itself is dull , and its message is hopelessly sentimental and confused . It is one thing to satirize the evils of predatory industrialism and hymn the praises of clean and sturdy toil . But it is nonsense to give the impression that hardship is better than ease , that back-breaking hours over a plow are beautiful , that the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motive was first discovered shortly before the Civil War . <P> Do n't Throw Glass Houses ( by Doris Frankel ; produced by Contemporary Stage ) . A smash miss .
