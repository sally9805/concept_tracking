Two years ago dark , spectacled , deliberate William Gellermann , a professor at Northwestern University , submitted a thesis for his Ph.D . at Columbia 's Teachers College . A War veteran and member of the American Legion , Professor Gellermann had written a copiously documented but partisan analysis of the Legion. * Its sponsor was Teachers College 's leftist Professor George Sylvester Counts . Last year , typewritten copies of this document got scant attention from the press . But last week , as the National Education Association gathered in . Manhattan ( see col. 3 ) and the first copies of Dr. Gellermann 's work came from the printers , an enterprising New York Times reporter mixed the two ingredients , produced an explosion . <P> Dr. Gellermann 's thesis , buttressed by 280 pages of citations from the record , was : 1 ) the Legion enrolls less than one-fourth of the 4,000,000-odd U. S. World War veterans , 2 ) it is undemocratically controlled by a small hierarchy of officials , 3 ) Legion leaders " have come from a class in American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " 4 ) chief activity of the Legion is fighting " subversive elements " and it has sponsored teaching of chauvinistic patriotism in the schools , 5 ) Capitalistic and militaristic , the Legion confuses " the middle class concerning its real interests , " is " a potential force in the direction of fascism in the U. S. " <P> Because it annually sponsors American Education Week jointly with the Legion , and solicits the Legion 's help to get more money for schools , the N. E. A. was highly embarrassed by this report . It hastened to disown Dr. Gellermann 's thesis . Meanwhile , Legionnaires sprang to arms . Said Theodore Roosevelt , a Legion founder : " The study must have been made by a jackass . " To Manhattan rushed National Commander Daniel J. Doherty to demand that the N. E. A. let him answer . Commander Doherty finally was given the floor at the convention 's last business session . Said he : <P> " I did not come here to vilify or castigate Professor Gellermann . . . . The highest evaluation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that it represents the puny product of a small mind . " N. E. A. 's delegates cheered . Mr. Doherty dismissed Professor Counts by remarking that he was an adviser to the Moscow Summer School , to Professor Gellermann 's charges , retorted that the Legion was democratically controlled by its 11,444 posts , today has the highest membership in its history-935,829 . Added Lawyer Doherty : " I am just a humble Legionnaire . . . . I know that I have no connection with any intrenched interests , financial , business or military . "
