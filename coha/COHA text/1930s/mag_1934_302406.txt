Subatomic investigators find neutrons elusive little things to deal with . Unlike electrons , protons and positrons , they have no electric charge . Slippery as wrestlers covered with oil they slide through the electric fields of atoms , are not deflected until they collide squarely with a nucleus . Nevertheless their mass ( about 1,800 times that of an electron ) has been established within fairly precise limits . And last week three Columbia physicists announced the size of the neutron as slightly less than .0000000000001 ( one ten-trillionth ) of an inch . <P> Before they could reach that conclusion even with the powerful wave mathematics developed by Germany 's Erwin Schrodinger , Drs . George Braxton Pegram , John R. Dunning and Isidor Isaac Rabi had to lead their particles like circus animals through a complex series of hoops &; hurdles . Beryllium powder was placed in a glass tube containing the radioactive gas radon . Alpha particles from the radon knocked neutrons out of the beryllium . First hurdle was a metal ring which deflected part of the neutron beam toward a cylindrical detection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The chamber 's door was guarded by a paraffin screen from which the neutrons evicted protons . Having positive charges , the protons ripped through the chamber , freeing ions which were collected on an insulated electrode so that their flow could be amplified , detected , measured . <P> Reduced to its simplest terms : <P> Just as one could establish the size of small boats anchored off-shore by the way that they reflected or scattered the incoming waves , so the three physicists estimated the size of atomic nuclei by the way in which they scattered the neutrons.
