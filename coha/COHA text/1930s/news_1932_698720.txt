txt Less than two weeks after agents of Andrew McCampbell , prohibition ladministrator , began a census of speakeasies in Greater New York the administrator ordered his men to begin what was expected to be one of the widest drives against beer and liquor New York has known in years . By 5 P. M. , when the office of the administrator was officially closed , 100 agents , operating in squads of two , had raided thirty-six cordial shops . speakeasies and restaurants and had brought fifty prisoners to the Federal Building for arraignment . The drive , it was said , may last until all of the drinking places in the city , put by compilers of the census at less than 20,000 , are visited . By throwing 100 men into the front line in raids in Manhattan and the Bronx the administrator left a force of only eighty to carry on in the other boroughs of the city and upState sections included in his district . All but one of the raids were in Manhattan . In this borough agents , acting under direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , completed their census a week ago yesterday . On the basis of figures obtained by sixty picked men who turned in a street-by-street report , Mr. Woodcock said last week before returning to Washington that the enforcement problem in New York was much simpler than he had imagined it to be . He declined to reveal the figures for Manhattan or to give out his estimate of the city 's total drinking places , but he hazarded the opinion that the total was " vastly fewer " than 32,000 , which was the estimate of Grover A. Whalen , former Police Commissioner . When the census was begun on April 5 , it was said to be a preliminary to a general round-up . Special Orders Issued . News that the drive had actually begun leaked out yesterday , and in spite of a denial issued later by the administrator that any special campaign was afoot , it was revealed that he had issued special instructions to his men shortly after headquarters in Washington Street opened yesterday . Mr. McCampbell summoned his men before him and instructed them to obey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was told to send the agents out in fifty pairs and " mop up " the places which the compilers of the wet directory had listed in Manhattan . The men were informed that all vacations and leaves had been canceled and that there would be no more vacations or leaves for possibly several months . The exact wording of the order was not verified , but it was said that the agents had been told that each must raid one place a day or " get out of the service . " Neither George Z. Medalie , United States Attorney , nor Arthur H. Schwartz , head of his prohibition division , was prepared for the campaign although both had conferred here last week with Mr. Woodcock . When the present administrator took office on July 1 , 1930 , he announced that New York could be made dry . His men last year arrested twice as many persons as had been arrested in 1930 and seized four i times as many gallons of liquor . No Drive , McCampbell Says . To prove that there was " nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that his average number of daily cases came to about thirty . " There is no drive on , " he said . " Today 's total will not be exceptional in view of the fact that about is00 places a month are raided . " Mr. Scelawartz , consulting his records for last year , discovered , when he was asked about this estimate that cases ranged from about 600 to 1,100 a month . While Mr. McCampbell refused to admit that the raids were " connected in any way " with the census of speakeasies completed in Manhattan , he added that in his opinion the law could be enforced more efficiently as a result of the census . There has been no official explanation of Mr. Woodcock 's reason for ordering the census , but it was said unofficially that it had been prompted by a desire to obtain a list of drinking places other than those raided on complaints . The same authority , who refused to be quoted , said that heretofore practically all raids had been made on complaints of citizens and in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly on two-for-a quarter places , cordial shops , east side " smoke joints , " tencent beer rooms on the west side and cheap restaurants , they were regarded as preliminary to sorties against better-class places . Mr. McCampbell told his men to call on headquarters if there was any doubt as to the propriety of stripping a certain place of its furnishings . This , it was said , indicated , that expensive resorts and night clubs were soon to share the fate of the smaller places . Some of the agents who brought prisoners to the Federal Building reported that news of the raids had spread like wildfire from speakeasy to speakeasy , many of the agents having failed to get admittance at " peep-hole " resorts . About forty of the more than fifty prisoners taken to the Federal Building were held in bail of $500 each when they were arraigned before Garrett W. Cotter , United States Commissioner . Last night nine men arrested in Brooklyn and Queens on various drylaw charges such as sale , possession or manufacture of liquor were arraigned before United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were held in bail ranging from $1,000 to $3,500 for hearings April 26 .
