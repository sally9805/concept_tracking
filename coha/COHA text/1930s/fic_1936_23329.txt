IN RIGHT A STORY BY IRA WOLFERT 19 ? EiE National Guard was sitting in the j. armory four blocks down the avenue , and the Mayor was sitting in his office a half mile away saying " no , " saying the strikers were behaving okay and orderly and the police could handle them all right and he was not going to call out the soldier boys when it was n't necessary . He said that in the newspapers ; and then the Company said in the newspapers that the Mayor had sold out to the reds and the town was in the hands of Moscow , because winning the strike without the National Guard was going to cost them plenty . The strikers could read . They knew all about what was going on and they were not making any trouble that would get the soldier boys down on them . Except that during lunch hour , when the machines stopped , they piled up outside the fence a block deep  --  men and women , holding up their children , holding up their empty dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come out , scabs ! " over and over again in one deep , endless roar . It made you weak . The first time it happened a quarter of the scabs picked up and walked out , saying they 'd rather be on relief than in the hospital . And the Company said they were going to get the National Guard out to protect their loyal workers if they had to take that Stalin down in the City Hall by the slack of his pants and bounce him on a bayonet . All the specials had their orders , and when it was twelve o'clock again and they were beginning outside , I ran on back to McGrady 's office . I ran through the mill room where the super was standing on a platform yelling , " There 's going to be shots . Do n't worry ! There 's going to be shots over the heads of the strikers . It 's just to scare the strikers away . Do n't worry ! This company takes care of its loyal workers . " I passed through the areaway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Company had n't wanted to load the place with city hard guys , because that would get them in wrong , so they had hired some college boys and some fellows like me , workers out of work and ready to do anything for eating purposes . But to show us the ropes they had some guys who made a business of being specials , rat-faced souses and little-eyed , white-lipped junkers that you could n't trust outside an electric chair . McGrady gave them vomit-gas guns and gave the rest of us lengths of lead pipe and he says , " Get going . Push them the hell away from that gate , Get going . " We piled on back through the mill room , a little knot of us , running hard at the double past the white-faced scabs , and ran down the front steps of the building to the yard . " Christ , " I thought , " this is killing , and I 'm not going to do it . " But in the back of my mind was the speech the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to replace their stall with accept . able men from the group who helped win the strike for them , and the thought rolled over and over inside of me while we ran toward the ear-filling , pouring roar . " Come out , scabs Come out , scabs ! " I wanted a job . I was crazy hungry for a job . " We 're coming , " yelled McGrady from fifty feet away . Then I heard the shots , four of them , from a window on the second floor . I had never heard shots before in sunlight , only in shooting galleries at night with carrousel music to make them sound sort of gay , and I felt myself winding up tight inside , and my heart going like a rock against the pavement , in hard , erratic , clattering bounces . For a single instant the roaring noise stopped . Then it began again , a group here , a group there , till everybody was swinging into it and the thunderous sound was filling the air . Somebody swung the gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  quietly , passively , without resistance . Then we were upon them , pushing . " Keep moving ! Come on ! Keep moving ! " You saw a woman 's fat sweating face and above her face a child 's hot red sweating face and both their mouths were open . You knew the sound pushing out of their convulsing throats was " Come out , scabs ! Come out , scabs ! " but you could n't hear the words . All you could hear was a great bellowing noise that flattened out your ears . You pushed at thin weak bodies and saw red eyes looking at you frightened . You pushed at skinny yielding arms and said , " Come on ! Keep moving ! Keep moving ! " The crowd was breaking up . The women and the kids and some of their men were drifting back out of the way , and some of the men were gathering in little groups , standing quietly , watching . The roar was quieting down and then you heard a scuffle alongside , slapping , thudding noises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You , George ! Come out of that ! " her scream as frantic as shots in the sunlight . You were afraid to turn your head , to lose sight of the red eyes in front of you and the yellow-facedunresisting men . You held the lead pipe in one hand and pushed with the other . Sometimes the pipe felt heavy and sometimes you did n't know you had it , and all the time there was this tightening inside , this strangling tightening in your chest and belly , and your eyes hurt , but you could n't stop moving them because you had to see everything . A brick went through glass off somewhere back of you and a brick scudded along the open space at your feet , but you could n't look away from in front of you because you were afraid , and you were afraid not to look because maybe now , maybe this moment , someone was aiming to give it to you from the side or from the back . Somebody came up against me and I pushed back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the top of my head was being blown off with sudden , crazy , wild fear . And right at that instant this little man standing in front of me , this thin , big-nosed , yellow-faced man with thick lips and wet red eyes looking into mine , started screaming , " Killers ! Killers ! " I could n't take any more . I could n't stand it any more , because all the time mixed up with my fear I had been thinking : poor dopes just like me , men like next door and women like my mother and kids like you see playing in front of my house . What am I doing pushing them around ? And on top of that this fellow looking at me , screaming , " Killers ! Killers ! " I busted him across the mouth with the lead pipe . His whole thin , screaming face seemed to fall into his mouth , and I said , " Move on ! Break it up ! Keep moving ! " There was pushing and shoving , trampling of feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt inside like I was fighting to keep myself from breaking out and screaming and killing . I must have been holding the lead pipe high , ready to hit if he came for me , because when a brick came along and knocked it out of my hand , I felt the pain shoot down my arm and go stinging up through the side of my face and into my head . I stooped and fumbled around for the pipe , keeping an eye on him , because I thought maybe he did n't know yet he had had enough . ? He came for me then , thin and spread out and loose , like paper in a rush of wind . He drove his skinny knee into my face and hit the back of my neck with his thin fist , and I had to back up . I backed up low against a car , and my head banged against the door handle . 1 felt a screaming inside my head , like my brain was screaming , and I rolled sideways and got around him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm going to kill you , you red bastard ! " I said . He did n't say anything . He could n't talk through the blood . He could n't open his mouth . His jaw was broken . He started to come in . I took one high in the face between the temples and the cheekbone . I felt his fist splash up against my face , soft as a splash of water . I knew I had him then . He could n't hit worth a damn . I felt good . I felt this was going to be easy and I rushed in exultantly. 1 let him have it in the groin with my shoe with all I had . I gave him my knee in the face . He popped like a grape and doubled up and went over backward . Then I was all over him . I hit him . I hit him till I felt the bones of his face splintering under my hands . He made no resistance after that first kick . He did n't move now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somebody yanked me up . " Come on , " he said . " It 's all over . " I heard McCrady yelling , " Get those cameras ! Smash those cameras ! " because they had been pointing at me . I looked at the body , the legs twisted in that odd quiet way that tells you a man is dead . " Come on , " he said . " Let those tin soldiers do something . " " He had it coming to him , the Jew red , " I said . " I give him what he asked for . " I saw men standing in a little knot on a street corner . They were yelling at us . A hundred yards back of them the street was filled with a great spreading throng of people . A bedlam was going up from them that rolled swollen through the air . The tin soldiers on horseback came up from the other direction . They rode by looking serious and frightened , mostly boys under their tin hats , with their long stiffly held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They 'll break it up . Leave it to the soldier boys . They got what it takes . " " All right , " I said . I did n't look at the body any more . I looked at the soldiers and the people backing away and running from under their horses ' hoofs . We went back to the factory . They had basins of cold water waiting for us alongside a nice clean little towel and a nice clean little cake of soap . I washed my face and hands and got the blood off , but I could n't get the fever out . The fever burned right through the cold water even as I splashed it over my face . I was hot all over . I was shaking . " Here you , what 's your name , " said McGrady , " I want to talk to you . " " Sure , " I said . " Yes , sure , okay . A minute . " He turned to go back into his office , believing I would follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get hold of myself . I went out through the millwhere the scabs were standing piled on tiptoe looking out the windows while the super yelled for them to get back to work , and I walked up the wide stone stairs to the office . Upstairs there was a group of meri and girls standing in a corner talking . They looked at me and stopped talking , and I felt suddenly frightened at what they might say about me . " They do n't know yet , " I thought , and walked on past them , putting out my chest and frowning and swinging my arms , swaggering because they looked at me with fear and respect and interest , as if I were something romantic in the pictures . But inside I felt like a little baby crying . I felt all flying apart . " Here , you ca n't go in there , " one of the men said , but they stepped a little away from me frightened , and I walked right on through the open door onto a carpet and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around slowly , importantly . I had my hand on his telephone on the big desk and he said , " What are you doing in here ? " " I 'm using your ' phone , " I said , and was surprised to hear the words come out in a threatening growl . I dialed long distance and gave her my home number and lost sight of the man , standing with his arms raised to his chest and his fists clenched and his smooth round , pink face scowling and frightened . " I just want to hear her talking , " I thought . " Hello , " I said when I heard my wife 's voice . " How are you ? " " I 'm fine , " she said . " What 's happen-ing ? " " How are things ? " I asked , feeling her cool , clean , soft voice flow into the broken heat inside me . " Are you all right ? " She sounded a little worried . " Oh sure , fine . Do n't wait dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bit , uneasily . It was a reminder of old times when I had had a job and l 'd call her up and tell her the boss was keeping me overtime and paying for our Saturday-night movies . She always waited to have dinner with me  --  sometimes till ten or eleven o'clock . I laughed too . I felt better . I felt more in one piece now and I hung up . " Now you get the hell right out of here , " the man was saying . I looked at him , saw him for the first time , and felt frightened and reckless . " Are you going to make me ? " I said , just like that . It was Wilson , the big shot , the boss of all the works , of this mill and ten others like it . He had a gray mustache standing on edge on his smooth pink face . He was a little man with eyes that were blue and sunny looking . He looked as if he had never had much to worry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worrying now . But he was . He was afraid . The " specials " had him scared . But in front of me he tried to look unconcerned . " You ought n't to come here , " he said . " Use the ' phone downstairs . " Suddenly , without thinking I was going to do it , I said exactly what I thought . I said , " I wanted to be out of it . I wanted to be some place quiet when I talked to my wife . " The girls and the men were standing in the open doorway listening to us . I started to walk toward them and Wilson , the big shot , the great big boss , came up to me and touched my elbow . " Pretty rough out there , " he said . I thought , " Well , he does n't know either . He does n't know yet it was me who did it . " And I broke all up inside again . I took two quick steps away from him toward the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just could n't stand any more . I fell down on my hands and knees  --  uh !  - -  - and my eyes seemed to roll along with the carpet that was rolling out from under my shaking body . The great big boss of all the works had flung his arms around me to hold me up . I smelled his washed , rich smell and heard his arms slap against my body and I heard him grunt with the strain . I was too heavy for him . " Those killers ! " he screamed . " Why do n't the police throw all those killers in jail ? " I trembled inside for an instant , quivering , cringing away from inside myself , because I thought at first he meant me . But that was silly . He did n't know yet . He would n't be acting like this to me if he knew . So he must be talking about the strikers . I tried to yes him . I could n't think of words . I could n't remember any language at all . I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's just a boy ! " and after that I guess I just passed out . When I saw something again it was a girl who was leaning over me and putting a cold towel that smelled from soap and the laundry on my forehead . " You poor boy , " she said , " you just lie right still . " " Hello , toots , " I said , " you look like somebody 's sister . " She was startled a moment , a little offended maybe . Then she said frostily , " I guess you 're feeling ukay , fresh guy . There 's a doctor coming for nothing . " I thought of telling her I needed a pretty nurse a damn sight more than a doctor , but suddenly in one swift-rolling wave I was sick of her , of talking , of playing the game of **27;416;TOOLONG . I lay there on the couch and let the thick-dripping horror drag through me . She was n't there any more , and I closed my eyes slowly and saw clearly in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop for a trick shot , the gray lead pipe as it lay across the man 's thick lips and saw his whole face crumble . I had n't meant to do it . Sure , judge , how often have you heard that one before ? How many years will that take off my sentence ? When I hired out as a special all I wanted was a job . I had n't had a job in so long . I had relief poisoning . I was fed up with doing nothing , fed up with having no place to go , with belonging nowhere . Did n't even want to go home any more and see my wife . I had told myself , " All right , I 'll take sides in this war  --  the right side . I 'll guard the plant 's property . I 'll be with the bosses , train with the top dog this time . " " Christ ! " 1 had often thought , when looking for a job , " if I could only get one of these bosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " because they never looked at me when they said , " Nothing . " They never even saw me , and I thought maybe if I took this job as a special I 'd be able to do something to get one of the bosses to look at me , run to open the door to his car or tip my hat and say " good night " or " good morning " or " fine day , " get him to see me and to say to himself , " well , that 's a fine upstanding young man , what can he do , maybe we can fit him into the or-ganization . " " Honey , " I told my wife , " once I get on the inside of that plant I 'll do something to make them know I 'm there . Once I 'm on the inside they 'll never get me out . I 'll have a footing then . They wo n't be afraid to look at me then , because they wo n't know I 'm looking for something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . These strikers had had jobs . Let them do nothing for a while . Let them taste relief meals for a while . Hell , if it was good enough for me , it was good enough for them who had had jobs and did n't know any better than to quit them in order to try and cut the boss 's throat . If they wanted more money , I thought , let them work for it . Let them get ahead in the world . After all , the boss was doing his best for them . He was trying to keep the plant going in these hard times and all the strikers thought of was listening to the reds , who got theirs from headquarters anyway and were paid to cut the boss 's throat . I had never been in a strike before or seen one . My jobs had always been with little fellows , auto mechanics . Maybe I was the only fellow in the shop with the boss . Maybe there was two of us , and if you wanted anything out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Then if he said " no , " you 'd try to find another job where you could get what you wanted . But it was all clean and open and aboveboard , something between two men who did n't go in for back-stabbing . " I want this . " " You ca n't have it . " " I 'll get it elsewhere . " " This is a free country . You 're welcome to try . " And I thought a strike would be something like that , only the men stick together and say , " If you do n't give us what we want , you try and get along without us . " Then the boss tried and if he could , okay , he won , and if he could n't , okay , the men won . Of course I had read about the fights that happened sometimes , men killed , dynamiting . But I thought that was those terrible reds , those Moscow killers who would n't know what a clean American argument between a boss and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company could n't get their scabs inside , because the pickets were packed so tight around the gate . And 1 heard Wilson say to Mc-Grady , " Make a stink out there . We 've got to get the National Guard . " And a little while later McGrady said to us , " Go on out and rough them up . Push them the hell away from that gate . Use your pipes . You 're deputies of the law . You 're not picking daisies . " But the Company had only a few guards and mostly the wrong kind too , because the boss did n't want to get in wrong unless he had to . And the strikers were holding oil , so everything went smooth , nobody got hurt , and the scabs ducked in all right . But the strikers must have made the rounds of the scab houses that night , those that were damn fool enough to go home , because a lot of them did n't check in the next morning and those that did were so scared their fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to be trouble when the scabs started to walk out the next noon . McGrady did n't seem exactly tickled to death because there had n't been any trouble the day before . I knew the Company was going to lose out unless it had the soldier boys to keep the streets quiet and give the scabs the courage to stick on their jobs , and when the pickets piled deep against the fence and started chanting for the second time , " Come out. , scabs ! Come out , scabs ! " I thought , " Here comes hell . " McGrady had n't said anything to me , but I could make a guess as to what he had said to those hard city guys among the specials . I made up my mind I was n't going to be a killer for anybody . I made up my mind I was n't going to use the lead pipe , only push around and look tough . But I felt guilty . I felt I was in a dirty business and I was scared I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ought to have my head broken , pushing around these poor people who were just like me and like the people I palled around with . These things were going around inside me all mixed up and then this fellow put the finger right on me and yelled , " Killers ! Killers ! " Damn it , he was just trying to keep his job . Well , damn it , I was just trying to get a job , just trying to fit myself back into the world . Maybe it 's funny , I thought , as the doctor came up , maybe it 's funny as an old lady breaking a leg , but I hit that guy because he called me a " killer , " and I knew he was wrong . But I could n't get a jury to go for that story . They 'd give me twenty years . " Sound as a drum ! " said the doctor , tapping me . " Sure , " I said . " I was just a little tired . " Wilson was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said to one of the girls , " Get him a glass of water . " And I thought , " God Almighty , but do n't I get all the breaks ! If I did n't have to go to jail now , I 'd get a job sure from him . I 'm in soft , in right  --  all except a little bit of murdering . " I drank the water in small swallows with my lips tight , to look refined . " I better go downstairs , " I said . " You 've done a day 's work , " said Wilson . " You rest now . " " And how I 'll rest ! " I thought bitterly . I shook my head , not trusting myself to speak , and went downstairs . I wanted to get it over with . I felt the awful suspense that hung over my head , that would hang over my head until the judge had said " ten years " or " twenty years " or whatever he was going to say . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I wanted it over with . This being in jail , waiting , was not going to be any Civil Service job for me . I wanted to know this minute what was going to happen to me . I had committed a murder in less than a minute . It would be weeks , months before I knew what would be the result of it and what they would do with the rest of my life . I knew that but I could n't get used to the idea . I felt I would bust apart with irritation at the sus-pease already , even before I had given myself up , even while I was walking toward McGrady 's office to make my report and wait for the cops . For a minute now I got panicky and thought of running away , ducking out and home , picking up my wife and lamming for the open road . McCrady was talking to a soldier with eyeglasses . He nodded to me and went on talking quietly and 1 stood there thinking , If only 1 could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If only , some way , I could cook up a self-defense story . " But there I had been , surrounded by maybe a thousand people , me with a lead pipe ? " lethal weapon " ? the other fellow with his bare hands . We all had been deputized . Officers of the law engaged in the performance of our duties . But there this fellow had been , standing with his bare hands down by his side . When the soldier went away , McCrady said , " Where the hell have you been ? " I told him 1 had passed out , and he said , " What 's a fag like you doing on a man 's job ? I 'll be goddamned , " he said , " ten million unemployed and we pick a bum like you for a job . " I did n't say anything . I stood looking at him . " I 'll tell you this much , " he said . " You keep better control of yourself after this . You keep your head on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " After this ! " I said . " After what ? You do n't .. . The cops 'll be here soon . Do n't you want a report out of me or something ? " " It was self-defense , was n't it ? " He looked at me carefully . " I got four affidavits signed saying it was self-defense , and one of them is from Mr. Wilson himself who was standing in the yard himself and saw you take the lead pipe away from the striker . That was the way it happened , was n't it ? " " Yes , " 1 said . " He swung . . . " " All right , save it . All right , sign this . This is your statement . " I held the pen in my hand and looked at him standing over me . " You wo n't regret this , " I said brokenly . " You wo n't be sorry you done this for me . " My eyes were wet and I could n't see well . " Listen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was up to me you 'd be at the end of a roperight now . If it was up to me I 'd have your heart out right now this minute . 1 do n't hold with killing . " He did n't raise his voice and he did n't make a move toward me . I could n't look at him any more . " I guess you 're right , " I said . I signed my name . " But you think of this , " I told him , looking squarely at him . " If it were n't for Wilson wanting a stink raised to get out the National Guard .. . " " All right , all right , " said McGrady . " Go back to work . You hold yourself ready to go down to the magistrate when they call you . You 'll probably have to watch him throw out the case . Read over your statement to-night . I 'll give you a copy so you 'll know the answers if the judge asks any questions . " " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in right with him . I wanted there to he nobody out to stab me in the back , no little boss , nothing . " But you do n't know how I feel , Chief , " I said . He came around his desk where he was putting away the affidavits and he put his hand on my shoulder . " I know , boy , " he said . " It was just a rotten run of luck . But remember this : This company takes care of its men . Now , back to your post ! Quick ! Double-quick , marchl " He clapped his hands together and I thought , give the old mutt a smell of a uniform and he lifts his leg sharp . I went back to the door I had been guarding since the beginning . There was a college boy sharing the post with me and when I came back feeling young , strong , exultant , he looked at me with respect . " You 're the one who clunked that guy out there , are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it , " I told him . " His tongue was hanging out for it . He came for me , swinging this long . , . " Then I stopped . I felt ashamed of myself . " My God , " I thought , " what 's happening to me ? What 's this doing to me  --  making me a killer , a boaster , a bootlicker . What kind of a stinker have I become ? " " So then ? " said the college boy eagerly . " Forget it , " I said , and looked out the window at the soldiers standing outside the gate with their bayonets at the ready , and at the hungry , tired , desperate-looking pickets marching up and down lugubriously , with a forced and wilting determination . I had been saying all my life , " This is a dog-eat-dog world . " That minute , for the first time , I understood to the last bitter letter what it meant . When Mr. Wilson came down under his Panama hat to go home he stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was feeling and said he was glad to hear it and said he 'd pick me up in his car and we'dgo down to magistrate 's court together . Yes , sir , thanks , sir , you 're being mighty decent , sir , I said . I knew I was in soft now . I knew he would make a steady job for me now in one of his mills out of town , because he thought I was loyal and he thought I knew enough to make a little trouble if he did n't appreciate my loyalty . Yes , I knew I was in plenty right . I knew my troubles were over , that I had climbed out of the gutter , and that it would be fine going home again at night . And I was thinking I would n't be happy again ever as long as I lived . THE HOUND BY ROBERT FRANCIS Ir the hound Equivocal Comes at a bound Either to rend me Or to befriend me .
