Last week the business conduct committee of the Chicago Board of Trade sent a questionnaire to brokers , asking for lists of all open accounts in rye of over 100,000 bu . Reason : suspicion of an attempted corner in rye . Grainmen scouted the idea of even a technical corner , but none of them denied that a major operation in the rye market had by last week boosted the price of that grain from 48 to over 61 . <P> The operator who stirred up the Board of Trade was that most scorned of all speculators , a doctor . Edward A. Crawford , M. D. , graduated in 1911 from the medical school of Valparaiso University , is not , however , a consulting room speculator . Some years ago he practiced medicine in Jacksonville , Fla. , then moved to New Orleans , gave up writing prescriptions and began writing market orders . In 1919 with a small stake , said to have been $800 made on the New Orleans Cotton Exchange , he shifted the scene of his unmedical operations to Manhattan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lb. , a man who dislikes tobacco , is indifferent to good clothes and almost as indifferent to statistics , he is a trader with a cold eye for a market profit . Totally lacking in the flush speculator 's flair for spending but showing a magnificent willingness to take risks , he has been long and short on a big scale in most commodities , many stocks . He engages extensively in the very risky business of writing puts and calls . He made a fortune ( reputedly $2,000,000 ) in the post-War boom , was cleaned out in 1921 . Since then he has been credited with several killings , debited with severe beatings . Last year he attracted notice with several big and profitable deals in cotton . Congress , prying into short sales , found him to have been short at one time 16,800 shares of Auburn Automobile Co. at the right time . Last March he invaded sugar , supposedly rode up with it from .7 to 1.25 , cleared $2,000,000 . <P> He is reported to have bought and taken delivery in May on 4,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the visible supply in the U. S. If he tries to get a corner grainmen prophesy that he will take a beating ; conversely , talk of a corner may contribute to his profits . Last week he maintained his usual canny silence , for the time being in Florida which possesses not only good telephone connections with Chicago but also real estate well suited to his talents .
