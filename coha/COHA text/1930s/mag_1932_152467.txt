Dearly would Socialist Norman Thomas of New York City like to be the eighth Ohioan , the third Princetonian to sit in the White House . Last week , at the Socialist National Convention in Milwaukee , he got his second chance with his second nomination . As in 1928 , his running mate was chosen to be James H. Maurer , one-time president of the Pennsylvania Federation of Labor . A 60-min. ovation greeted their uncontested nominations . Candidate Thomas keynoted his campaign thus : " Not merely or chiefly the Democratic or Republican parties , but the capitalist system behind them stands exposed in all its brutal stupidity . Its days are numbered . Its doom is written in its own failures . . . . The choice now confronting the world is between Socialism and catastrophe ! "
