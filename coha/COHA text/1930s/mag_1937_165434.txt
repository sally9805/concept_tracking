SISTER OF THE ROAD-As told to Dr. Ben L. Reitman-Macaulay ( $2.50 ) . <P> Nobody knows how many hoboes there are in the U. S. Nobody knows how many of them are women . Relief Administrator Harry Hopkins says there are 6,800 . " BoxCar Bertha , " whose ghost-written autobiography appeared last week , doubles the estimate . Whether or not Bertha is always strictly accurate in her figures or her facts , her narrative is cauliflower-ear-marked by the brutal truth , wears no wig . Beside Sister of the Road , such recent revelations as Mark Benney 's Angels in Undress and John Worby 's The Other Half , pale into comparative respectability . Bertha 's birthright was a mess . Her mother , a handsome blonde who advocated and practiced free love on her father 's Kansas farm , had four children , each by a different man , took to the road when Bertha was an infant . Bertha 's " first playhouse was a box car . " Her progressive education began early : her teachers were labor agitators , I. W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up her three S 's : sex , strikes , socialism . Included in her haphazard schooling were two years during the War in an Arkansas cooperative colony run by radicals and conscientious objectors , where she read William Morris , Oscar Wilde , Walt Whitman , Zola . When her mother came back from an anti-War tour with a young Irish poet in tow , they all went to Seattle , where Bertha 's mother entered the University of Washington . There Bertha , now 16 and 160 lb. , " like a truck horse , " had her first lover . She took to the road , fell in love with an anarchist in San Francisco , followed him to New Orleans . By the time she had made her first swing around the country she knew all the ropes . In Chicago , which she calls the woman hobo centre , she worked a while for a celebrated abortionist ; later traveled for some months with a gang of shoplifters . <P> Bertha knows all about dope and the dope traffic , but says she never became an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appease her insatiable curiosity she became a prostitute , found the job unexciting . " I just felt completely wornout , as though I 'd finished an unusually hard day 's work . " The earnings varied from $50 to $200 a week , but pimps and madams took all but a Woolworth-store residue . Arrested after two months ' work , 30 men a day , Bertha found herself pregnant , with two venereal diseases . While waiting for her confinement she worked in a hospital laboratory , eventually gave birth to a robust baby girl . <P> In Chicago she watched an old grifter friend hanged for a payroll murder , got jobs in transient bureaus which never lasted longer than the time it took to check up on her past record . When Bertha struck up acquaintance with a statistician working on a Federal transient survey and he offered her a job , she took it ; her wanderlust was nearly sated . She decided to settle down in Manhattan , raise her own child . She was 30 , and she had seen the world .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
