WAR <P> In Ethiopia , after the great Italian victory of Marshal Badoglio on the North Front ( TIME , Feb. 24 ) , the routed Ethiopian army of Ras Mulugheta was retreating in moderately good order across Tigre Province last week , but the fate of stragglers was hard . <P> Tigre tribesmen apparently considered that the authority of Emperor Haile Selassie in their province had been shattered and that any of his soldiers not natives of Tigre were fair game . As an exhausted straggler would stumble into a village last week , angry spearmen would rush out to ask " Ane men ? Who are you ? " If the straggler answered in any Ethiopian tongue except the Tigrean dialect he was killed . <P> Next obstacle to the Italians , towering 11,000-ft . Mount Alaji did not fall last week as Marshal Badoglio put every available soldier to working on roads and perfecting his service of supply for a fresh offensive . In Rome numerous Italian Senators heard the Papal Secretary of State , Eugenio Cardinal Pacelli , deliver an address which kept Fascists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Holy Father had at last come out wholeheartedly for Italy 's war . They considered this to have come to pass when Cardinal Pacelli hailed Dictator Mussolini as " not only the Head of the Government but a most cultured Restorer of Imperial Rome . " However the Papal Secretary of State some minutes later closed with these ringing assertions : " Rome is God 's City ! . . . Rome was by Providence ordained and prepared to be the Capital of the World . . . . Rome has one Throne-that of the Pope ! One flag- the Cross ! "
