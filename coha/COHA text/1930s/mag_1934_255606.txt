If there were not a George Dimitroff in the life of Hermann Wilhelm Gring , it might be necessary to invent one . When Comrade Dimitroff was on trial in the famed Reichstag arson case , Prussian Premier Gring , through whose official residence the fire bugs apparently entered , screamed in open court : " I am not afraid of you , you rascal ! You have reason to fear that I 'll catch you when you 're out of prison ! You dirty rascal ! You dirty rascal ! " This scene Elmer Rice has put into a play ( TIME , Sept. 24 ) . <P> Lately beefy , foppish Premier Gring has had two paramount worries : 1 ) Is Reichsfhrer Adolf Hitler going to name him as " Deputy " or Vice-Realmleader ( TIME , Sept. 17 ) to step into Hitler 's shoes in case of death ? 2 ) Is Comrade Dimitroff , now safe in U. S. S. R. , organizing a plot to assassinate him ? Last week smart Dimitroff answered both questions in Moscow in his own inspired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in killing Gring because eventually Hitler will do it . " <P> Premier Gring controlled himself with difficulty . In anguish his political news-organ , the National Zeitung , called Dimitroff 's prediction a " lie . " Anxiously grooming Gring for the job of Hitler 's Deputy , it went on : " The Realmleader 's glance , if he must have a Deputy , falls more and more on his old and true fellow-fighter Gring.
