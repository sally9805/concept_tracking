PROPOSAL A STORY BY ELAINE STERNE CARRINGTON MARILcame in sight of the tennis court . Her sister , Ad- YN --  rianne , was playing with Jack Loomis , knocking the white balls back and forth across the net in desultory practice . Half an hour ago Marilyn had been playing with them and now , standing there on the grassy slope that swept down to the edge of the red en tout cas court , she felt as if all that had taken place since then had made them strangers to her , strangers in the sense that everything , the garden , the tennis court , the lawn , the paddock , the house were strange to her as if she saw them all for the first time ; as if she stood off , apart from them ; as if she had been torn loose , sent spinning into space and could never return again . No . She could never go back to where she had been before . Never bat balls across the sagging net to Jack Loomis , never shout to Adrianne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chin on her palms , in quite the old way . Jack saw her , flipped a hand at her , called , " I beat her . " They stopped playing and came slowly towards her . He thinks it 's I , Marilyn said to herself ; only it is n't . It 's somebody else . She had a thrilling , ecstatic sense of having shed her old body , her old mind , and of having assumed a new one . She felt  --  smiling down at them , waving back  --  that they must some-how , even at that distance , sense the change that had come over her . Surely something quivering , something iridescent enveloped her ! She called , " I 'm going in , " and turned abruptly toward the house . She was , she found , unable to talk to them to anyone . She went around the paddock where the fat , old pony , Merrylegs , which had been hers and Adrianne 's and Martha 's , now spent halcyon days actually in clover , his shaggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white legs . He was tugging at the shining grass blades , ripping them loose with a toss of his mane , returning to lip more and still more of the tender , juicy grass before properly finishing a mouthful . Merrylegs . The same pony , and yet different . Even Merrylegs meant something new and exciting now ! She called to him over the white fence , " Here , Merrylegs . Here , Merrylegs . " He continued his feast unmoved , making pleasant little tearing sounds as the roots came away from the tight brown earth . She leaned there , watching him , her chin on her folded arms . She could remember perfectly the feel of his fat little body between her legs ; she could remember the tug on her wrists when he suddenly ducked his head to graze . " Maybe my babies will ride on your back , " and the thought sent her heart galloping in her breast . Think of thinking about babies ! She whirled and dashed headlong toward the house , as if running could cool her blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart . Nearing the house , seeing figures seated on the terrace , her mother and a guest , she slowed down . She could not go charging up the path in that fashion . But what if she did ? What if she shouted , " Mother , I 'm engaged ! Mother , Donny and I are going to be married ! Mother , at half-past four this very afternoon  --  how do I know it was half-past four ? I looked at my wrist watch . I said , Donny , I 'll never forget half-past four again as long as I live ! ' " Silly . Bursting with happiness . She stopped short . So this was happiness ! The thing you read about . And now , suddenly , miraculously , in this blinding instant she knew the meaning of it . No words could describe it . It was an internal whirlwind . It tore you up from the roots , just as Merrylegs tore the young grass blades . It left you breathless and dizzy and a stranger to yourself . Her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catching sight of Marilyn , her mother called out , " Oh , Mary , will you run in and tell Kathy to lay two extra places ? Martha and Joe will be here for dinner . " Mrs. Devereaux smiled and nodded to Marilyn . " Hello , dear , playing tennis ? " " Yes , Mrs. Devereaux . " " I hear you 're in the semi-finals at the Club . " " Yes . " " Well , I hope you win . " Her mother said , " Darling , you look so warm . You 'd better take a shower . " " Yes , mother . " The two women resumed their conversation . Marilyn thought , I couldgive them something to talk about , I could give everyone something to talk about . She went indoors , whistling . She thought , Martha and Joe for dinner . Martha and Joe . I wonder if Martha ever felt this way ? I wonder if anyone ever felt this way ? She met Kathy on the stairs , told her about the extra places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become , strangely enough , merely a room in her mother 's house , completely detached from her . When I get a house of my own , she thought , I 'm going to do it in early American with cunning little curly maple dressers and candlewick spreads and things . A house of her own ! A maid of her own ! A maid in a stiff white organdie apron who would knock at the door each morning for the day 's orders  --  the way Kathy did . Who would summon her to the telephone , " Mrs. Leavitt , it 's your father calling . " Mrs. Leavitt ! Mrs. Leavitt ! She waltzed round the room , and stopped before the mirror , tipping it forward to examine her face . Did she look as different as she felt ? Her lips smiled back at her and suddenly she leaned forward and kissed the parted red lips of the girl who was herself . It was growing dark in the room . The river , which lay like a slab of cold , gray slate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She curled up on the window seat and stared out at the distant hills still faintly illuminated by the yellow afterglow of the setting sun . She tried , sitting there , dimly conscious of voices , of laughter , of the stabbingly sweet odor of new-mown hay , to recapture each instant of that golden afternoon . It was as if she feared by moving , by speaking , almost by breathing , to break the spell . Donny 's car had come up the driveway . She had seen it from the tennis court , felt the sudden , quickened beating of her heart and the tightening of her throat at the sight of it ; missed an easy shot ; blurted out an apology . It was her serve . She sent the ball spinning into the net , thrillingly aware that Donny was bounding across the grass toward her . She heard Adrianne say , " Doubles ! " triumphantly . Donny shouted , and she turned and called out to him and went back to the miserable game , with the hand that held the racquet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her knees . It was over at last . Adrianne and Jack walked off the court to where Donny lounged on the grass under the trees , " Hello , " they said idly . He got up , greeted them , came toward her . " Swell tennis ! " he grinned , then , in a low voice , " Come on . Want to tell you something . Get in the car . " She obeyed instantly . " Hey , where are you going ? " Adrianne shouted after her , " How about doubles ? " They did not answer her . Marilyn 's heart beat suffocatingly . She was filled with a crushing fear lest what he had to say was that he was off on the wing again . After all , he had been home longer this time than ever before . Yes , that was probably it . He was starting out again for some far distant corner of the globe . " I just wanted to tell you that I 'm leaving for Timbuctoo to-morrow . " Or it might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could bear it . She wondered if he would ever know how much she loved him , how much she had always loved him . He did not speak but drove recklessly , charging across streets , clipping corners , skirting cars , just as he did everything , swiftly , dangerously , confidently . Then they came to the Hill Road , on top of which was the Plateau . There at nights lovers parked , dimmed their lights and clung together , silent and tense . Now , in the warm , orange light of late afternoon , it was deserted , and the view to the right showed a thin blue line of mountains , and to the left , far below , the river . There was an eerie stillness to the place now that the motor was suddenly silenced . Donny sat without speaking , staring straight out before him . Then he said , abruptly , " Marilyn , how old are you ? " " I 'm eighteen . Why ? " He shook his head . " Lord but you 're young ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fiercely , " Do n't laugh ! " and he was silent again , wrapped in a dark mantle of thought , his lean , handsome face grim . For no reason at all she began to tremble . She thought , why does n't he speak ? Whatever it is , why does n't he speak ? He spoke at last . " Mary , you 've got to marry me . " It was wrung from his lips despairingly . She gasped , " What  --  what did you say ? " " I 've tried not to say it . I 've tried to go away and leave you . I 've tried telling myself I 'm all wrong for you . It 's no damned use . I 'm licked . " She thought , this is n't happening to me . I 'm dreaming it . I 'll wake up and find it has n't happened . He went on , in a rush of words , " If you were anyone but little Marilyn Davis whom I 've known all my life , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you off and live with you . It would be better for you too then , when you got tired of me , as you will  --  yes you will . Do n't interrupt  --  you could chuck me and go home . But please say yes , it 's your hard luck , but for God 's sake say you 'll marry me . " She said , " Of course I 'll marry you , Donny . I always intended to . " " You always  --  you what ? " He whirled , seized her shoulders , stared into her eyes , thrust her away , said , " You 're making a terrible mistake . You like an orderly life . You like home and hearthstone . I have to rush from one end of the world to the other . I 'll be a millstone around your neck . You ought to think this over carefully . Weigh the pros and cons . The cons have it , hands down . I 'm moody and bad-tempered . I hate being anchored . I hate possessions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw me over . Say it ! " " I 'm not going to throw you over . " He held her loosely and gazed down at the hills turning purple . When he spoke again it was with tragic intensity . " Do n't let anything anyone says against me change you . Do n't believe them . What they say will be true . All of it . Every word . But do n't believe them . " She sighed against him . She said , " Let 's get married soon . Let 's not ask . They 'll say no . Let 's just do it and tell them about it afterward . " " Would you dare ? " Yes . " " To-morrow ? " " Yes . " The hall door opened . Adrianne came into the room , switched on the light , and said , " Oh , are you here ? What are you doing ? " " Thinking . " " Are n't you going to dress for dinner ? " " I suppose so . " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Marilyn did not answer . " What 's the matter with you ? " " Nothing . " Adrianne ripped off her sweater , her dress , stood regarding her sister , frowning . " Did you have a scrap with Donny ? " " If you ask me , I think he 's a wet smack . " " You mean you do n't like him ? " " No . But you do . " " What makes you think so ? " " Do n't you ? " " Sort of . " " Well , you certainly run when he whistles . I guess all girls do except me . I have n't any use for his kind . Neither has mother . She told me she hoped you were n't seeing too much of him . Where did you go this afternoon ? I 've half a mind to tell her . She 'd be furious . I heard her telling father she hoped he 'd go away soon . I do n't see what you see in him . I like people you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person . He 's a flea . " Marilyn rose , stretched , yawned . " Well , I guess I 'd better startdressing . " Adrianne watched her closely , " You have n't a case on him , have you ? I mean a real one ? " " On Donny ? Me ? No . Of course not . " Adrianne said , " Well , that 's a relief ! " and flung into the bathroom . Marilyn could hear the swift rush of water as she turned on the shower . Then Adrianne began to sing in her high , sweet voice , stopped short , shouted , " Jack 's staying for dinner . He 's the kind of man / like . Steady . You know where you 're at . Not always chasing rainbows . Not always going off half-cocked . " Marilyn did not reply . She stood looking down at the fourth finger of her left hand , a little smile creeping to the corners of her mouth .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
