 | DOES work ever kill a man ? There are many who claim that it does . Just a casual remark you overhear in the subway or on the top of a bus : " Too bad about Joe . He was only fiftytwo , but no human being could have stood the strain of the amount of work that fellow did . " Or " Bill should have lived until he was a hundred , and here he goes and dies at forty-seven . Yes , sir , he should not have spent such endless hours at his desk . " All of which sounds very sad in a day and age when science has most generously presented us with about seventeen extra years ( per man , woman , and child ) as compared to our grandfathers . And then we blame the mad hurry of modern life , the strain of the modern city , the irregular hours for food and sleep that are a result of the mad struggle for success and the terrific pace we have to follow if we wish to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake our heads and say , " All that used to be much better arranged in the olden days . " And we rack our brains for the names of those marvelous men who , single-handed , did as much work as seven or eight normal persons could hope to perform during a lifetime-and-a-half . We quickly go over that roll of honor , enumerating such artists and writers and sculptors as Bach and Lope de Vega , and Titian and Rembrandt and Rodin , who with a weak physique yet worked with the steady devotion of inspired coalheavers ; who never , as far as we know , took a vacation in our sense of the word ; and who died with their boots on and their goose-quills in their fingers at the  | ripe old age of sixty or seventy or eighty or what-have-you . If they could survive a burden of labor that would have driven a camel to drink , then , so we ponder with a sigh , the race must have deteriorated horribly during the last two or three hundred years . Which , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all wrong . For the race as a whole , instead of deteriorating , has greatly improved since the Middle Ages , and the chances for survival of the average citizen today are infinitely higher and better than they were a hundred or even forty years ago . But those ancient Giants of Work who all alone seemed able to remove entire mountain loads of effort knew a secret which many of us seem to have forgotten . They understood the value of constant change . They turned from painting to etching and from etching to drawing . They ceased for a while to compose symphonies for orchestra to devote themselves to trios and quartets for stringed instruments . They worked in clay or @# bronze or silver or copper and then varied their statuary diet by doing a little something in marble . And because their mind was forever kept in a changing mood , they could stick to the fourteen-hour day for years at a time without the slightest uncomfortable fear of the undertaker awaiting them around the next corner . They often led highly irregular lives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they consumed their ill-assorted meals at the most unholy hours imaginable . They caught a bit of sleep whenever it was catchable , and when they were engaged on a rush job , they would often neglect their hours of rest until they slept where they stood , like tired cabhorses in the days before the gasoline  | coach . In short , they sinned against every known rule of health and broke every precept of sensible existence . But they escaped the one affliction that kills so many of our contemporaries who die before their time . They avoided monotony like the plague . We of the year 1930 have abolished the plague . But unfortunately we have not yet dealt with monotony , and it slays its thousands as the plague slew its hundreds of thousands . And that is really a very foolish thing in this Era of Intelligence , when the Pyramids have just been celebrating their four-thousandth birthday and when there is hardly a man between the Golden Gate and the Ambrose Lightship who does not enjoy at least a fortnight of absolute freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can inoculate himself against the dangerous microbe of boredom by an application of mild doses of intelligent traveling and by giving not only his body , but primarily his mind , a complete change of surroundings and impressions . Get a Mental Change I have let the cat out of the bag . It is really the mental change that counts most . A mere physical change without a corresponding mental change will do very little good . As a rule it means nothing beyond a mere waste of time and money . One can be just as weary of life on top of Mount Washington as in an office at the bottom of one of those dark and dismal ravines that go by the name of " modern city streets . " And it is quite possible to derive just as little excitement from a picnic lunch at the bottom of the Grand Canyon as from eating a hasty ham sandwich on the fifty-second story of a downtown office building . For when we travel our happiness does not depend upon the make of the car in which we drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound . It depends for its ultimate results upon the attitude of mind of the person who sits behind the wheel . A savage from the African jungle in a limousine is still a savage from the African jungle . He first has to learn how to appreciate what he sees around him before he will derive any benefit from his perilous peregrinations into the realm of the white man . And what holds true of the savage holds true with equal insistence of the most civilized citizens of the most civilized country of the year 1930 . Travel in and by itself is mere commotion , a mere disturbance of air by certain bodies being projected aimlessly from one spot to the next . Travel accompanied by a conscious desire to give the spirit a thorough overhauling means the rejuvenation of the whole mental and physical apparatus . The former is an investment that had best be paid in Confederate money . The latter produces a revenue in actual dollars and cents that mounts up to a great deal more than has been expended on the vacation itself . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment concede that it is true , for how can one hope to compose a philosophical argument without a bit of guessing ? ) then what is the way to get hold of that rich return of which I have just spoken ? The answer is a very simple one , " Travel as ye please . " Do n't travel to get somewhere , but travel to get nowhere . Do n't travel to get anything , but travel to forget everything . " Yes , " you will answer , " that sounds very pretty on paper , and it is one of those clever things for which writers are paid much more than they deserve , but how about the practical side of the problem ? Suppose we did not know where we would be on Tuesday the 28th of August , and suppose we had therefore not ordered rooms ahead , and suppose we had not bothered about the steamship tickets for July in the previous January , and suppose we found ourselves in Montreal or Paris when we ought  | to have been back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dried herring that would be ! It is all very well for authors and other intellectual vagabonds to speak of travel as ye please . ' But the rest of the world has certain definite obligations and is bound to obey a schedule . It has to be in certain well-defined places on certain well-defined hours , for otherwise what would become of business ? " To which I answer : " Precisely . Business could not get along without well-defined hours and all the rest of it . But travel is not business and never should be business . It should be fun . Did you ever see a man grow hilarious while reading a time-table ? Or shake with inner mirth while perusing the closing hours of the Metropolitan Museum ? " I ought to add here that these admonitions are not addressed to persons who either in mind or body have already passed into the class of the so-called " older generation . " These had better turn themselves into Pilgrims of Punctuality and know beforehand just exactly why and how and where they should be at every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could expect to find in Montgomery , and whether or not there would be shrimps on the bill-of-fare of their inn in the Rockies . The slightest deviation from the normal would be as dangerous to them as a sudden rise of three degrees would be to the tropical fishes in our aquarium . They had better never stir from the hotel without a sheaf of typewritten instructions , and perchance they should lose one set they had better telegraph right away for a new supply . But those who can still sense the delightful itch of wonder in the tips of their ears whenever the great Goddess of Chance speaks to them had better listen to her counsel if they truly wish to keep themselves young by means of a little traveling . I am sorry to warn them that frequently they will run the risk of being exceedingly uncomfortable . They may even have to go without an occasional meal , and I can not always guarantee them the best room they will soon discover that even a night spent in a car will not kill them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so terribly bad , provided the absurd adventure through which they pass suffices to stock at least ten cubic feet of their memory . As Chaucer Did It Chaucer 's pleasant traveling companions patronized places that we today would refuse to use as gas-stations . Their sleeping quarters were not always clean , and the food was poor , and as a rule the ale was sour . But what a mighty good time was had by all ! They were bound for a definitely defined location , but they were in no hurry , and took time off to rest their souls in patience and replenish their minds in peace . Nowadays even third-rate hotels are fairly clean . More or less edible food can be obtained in the smallest hamlets , and the ale is never sour because there is no longer any ale . The spirit of the pilgrim , however , has gone out of the land . It was driven out by a profound misconception regarding the true nature of travel . It can be restored only by a better and more thorough appreciation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is the little lesson I am trying to preach . Travel as ye please . " Very well , " you will interrupt me here ; " all that is very pretty and very nice and Heaven knows we have listened to you with unusual patience , but what do you want us to do ? Dress up like medieval friars and knights and go galloping all over the landscape on muleback and on donkeys , telling each other funny stories while we quaff our potion of sarsaparilla ? That is movie stuff , my dear sir . We had better leave it to the folks in Hollywood . Meanwhile what is there for us to do ? "  | Let me try to tell you : You have two weeks holiday each year . Suppose you want to use those two weeks to take a trip through the New England states and just beyond the Canadian border . You can do that , of course , in the good old-fashioned manner by going to a travel bureau where they will sell you nice canned trips all neatly done up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel bureaus have developed a degree of skill and organization that borders upon the incredible . They would take the yak ( a three-letter word from central Asia ) out of the Zoo and bill him through all the other circuses and zoological gardens of the United States , and they would do that with such enormous precision that the poor beast would be back in its cage long before it had realized what had happened to it . With equal facility they would take ten thousand Boy Scouts , Revolutionary grandfathers , Prisoners of Circumstances , or Granddaughters of the Appalachian Landslide , and send them forth upon a two-weeks ' frolic without the loss of a single train , soul , or nickel . Since the yak speaks only Chinese , it would be impossible to get a clear idea of his impressions , but the ten thousand Hadji 's could be interviewed , and when asked for their impressions they would probably answer that they had had a wonderful time and that they had traveled like comfortable , first-class express packages and had not been obliged to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time they had been abroad . " It was just like home , " they might answer , " only that we were somewhere else where the furniture was in better repair and the postage stamps cost money . " And from that sort of trip one would hardly expect that profound mental change which is a surer germ-killer than all the nostrums of Christendom put together . " Yes , " you reply , " but is there another way to do the thing ? " There surely is , as I shall now tell you . Here 's a Good System Suppose , as I said a moment ago , you have two weeks ' holiday , and you possess a car that is good for at least three weeks more . Suppose you look at the map and locate one particular spot where you will have to be twenty-four hours before they expect you back at the office . That is sufficient for your purposes . Tuck the name of that town away in some convenient corner of your brain and forget about it until twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaps of Time . Fill the old cabriolet with suitcases and relatives and gasoline and start off in the general direction of X , the convenient city that lies buried in your mind like another Troy or Jericho . But when afternoon comes , and you have been gone for several hours , and little Willie says , " Pa , how many more miles are we going today and where do we stop for the night ? " tell him that that is a secret and that you wo n't tell him . For if the voyage were merely a question of miles , you might push the car on to one of those funny contraptions they used to employ in the third act of the ancient Rural Draymas to run the horse-race , in which the hero 's Rosinante would win , and you could keep the old machine doing its steady three hundred miles per day until it was time to turn off the electric current when you would stop and say , " Well , anyway we . ran three thousand miles in a fortnight , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , much against his usual habit , will have to possess his soul in patience , and that will not only be good for his impatient soul , but also it will be an exercise in self-control and fortitude that will bring forth its own reward . For as soon as you have left town behind you . ( and that process alone will have taken you the greater part of the first day ) , and have reached the open country , there is a turning of the road . and that turning of the road was meant for you . You have not the faintest notion whither it will carry you , but that does not matter , and you @#  | do n't care . Road making is a difficult and back-breaking job , and therefore you realize that a road , once it is there , must lead somewhere . That road , like all well-behaved roads , will have a good many minor turnings . Welcome these as an Arab welcomes the few drops of water that remain from last year 's freshets . For they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are after . In ordinary life that same unexpected is not an element you like to contemplate , for it is perturbing to your peace of mind , and ninety times out of a hundred means a polite note from the income tax tyrants who with the help of the higher mathematics and logarithms have discovered that you overlooked seventeen dollars and fortynine cents on your return for 1921 . Or it might mean a summons to appear in the presence of that mighty potentate who within the walls of your counting-house is known briefly as " the Boss . " But when you are on your holiday , the unlooked-for experiences are worth their weight in gold . I do n't mean to imply that they will always be hilariously agreeable . On the contrary . But that will be their greatest fascination . They will be unpredictable and undependable . At one turning of the road you will meet with a well-disposed old farmer who tells you to help yourself to the shadow of his orchard and his apples , and at the next a far-from-well-disposed dog with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inform you that as far as he is concerned you had better stick to the main highway and not venture to tread upon the hallowed soil that has been entrusted to his care . Sometimes you will catch a sudden glimpse of something as beautiful as a sunset in the desert , and upon others you will discover that when it comes to littering things up , the simple villagers can do almost as well as the mob that invades Coney Island on the hottest Sunday in July . But that will all be in the day 's work . The beauty of your program will be that you will have no program at all . And what holds good for the road you follow also holds good for the time you are supposed to spend in enforced rest from labor . You Will Revaluate Time Time , of course , is a strange substance almost as elastic as a fresh rubber band and as tangible as a ray of sunshine . Because we live in an age of machines and precision we have come to think of time as something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cubes like gingerbread or a pudding . But that that is not true , you know from your own experience . An hour is not always an hour . The sixty minutes you spent at the dentist 's awaiting the arrival of the nurse who would say : " It is your turn now . Just breathe quietly , and that tooth will be out before you can count three , " are different from , and about a thousand times as long as , the sixty minutes you conversed for the first time in your life with the one being in the world who made you feel that the world , after all , had not been created in vain . The hours that were bestowed upon you to be used for vacational purposes are of as uncertain an origin as those with which you deal during the ordinary course of business . According to the way you employ them they will revaluate themselves into periods that are slightly longer than the vast era that stretches from the death of Solomon to the election of President Hoover , or they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your memory . For time has no substance , and the hours depend for their true nature upon the use you make of them . I have seen people sit down in front of the most sublime scenery in the world , saying , I " Well , let us kill time and cut the cards , " and intone the dreary doxology of " Three clubs . . .  | four spades . . . no trumps . I pass , " declaring that the view was probably all right . but that a view after all was only a view , while a good hand of bridge was a good hand of bridge . I am not offering to criticise them for this is a free country , and every one is entitled to seek his or her salvation after his or her own sweet will , but I am writing this principally for those who have ears to hear and eyes to see , and they will know what I mean when I say that that sort of time-killing during vacations is perhaps not the happiest way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In connection with which I could say a few pertinent things about the sort of literature that people are supposed to take with them on their trips . Time-tables have their uses , but they are not the most exhilarating form of reading matter . I am familiar with the socalled guide-book travelers . They sit peacefully in a corner of the car or the train and read aloud from a little blue or red book telling those who are a little more inquisitive what they ought to see ? " We are now coming to a church built in the year 1837 entirely of red brick . . . to the right there is a clump of trees . then we come to the village of Renavilla . . . famous for its chickencoops . it has 781 inhabitants . . . please count them . 781 . not .780 or 782 . . . three miles further down the road narrows considerably . . . " and so on , and so forth . The Right Sort of Guidebook There are people who like travel of that sort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and coffee that never knew a bean , and I wish them joy . But personally I prefer those who will spend some time at the bookstore or the local library trying to find certain books that either in fiction form or in a purely descriptive way tell these wanderers all about the countryside through which they expect to pass , that they may know the background of the land of their predilection and not feel that they are mere visitors in a museum which they have to see because it is the thing to do . All of which , I grant you , is extremely vague advice . But alas ! that can not be helped under the circumstances . For the sort of traveling I have in mind is mostly a matter of the spirit , and the spirit is the one thing left in this world that can not be reduced to a formula or dissected with the help of a slide-rule . One can only hint at its existence and its manifold delights , and one can hint only discreetly and guardedly , because the dangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than legion . But if you can read between the lines of what I have written ? if you can say to yourself , " Yes , this fellow is probably right ? and what in Heaven 's name does it matter to myself or my family or the world in general how far I travel provided I travel wisely ? " then you will not have wasted ten minutes in vain , for you will have acquired the beginning of a new wisdom and a new happiness , and the word " vacation " will lose its old meaning of " something vacant and empty , " and become a mental and spiritual filling-station that will provide you with enough fuel to get through life with a minimum of discontent and a maximum of enjoyment . And if you do n't believe me , try it just once , this method of traveling as ye please . And if you do n't like it , let me know , and I will come and , as part of my punishment , recite whole pages from any time-table you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me an old copy of the magazine of the Geodetic Survey , and I will read you all about the height and substance of our most important mountain ranges neatly tabulated according to the alphabet of those Phoenicians who first of all taught us the beauty of systematic wandering across the face of the earth . And that , methinks , is as fair an offer as you will meet in many a day .
