In most of the 430,000 square miles of China thus far " conquered " ' by the Japanese , hundreds of thousands of embattled Chinese peasants keep up today an endless sniping resistance to their conquerors . The daring and resourceful Chinese who are trying to thwart and exhaust the Japanese in this most extensive of modern history 's guerrilla campaigns have made some of the most exciting stories of the war . By the nature of the fighting , however , they make them in the dark . <P> The Associated Press sent a correspondent southward from Peiping on June 11 to plunge into guerrillaland and get the story . His dispatches are now reaching the U. S. by mail . For the present , AP dares not divulge his identity . <P> When it does come out his name will be listed in U. S. journalism 's evanescent hall of fame-alongside those of Archibald T. Steele of the Chicago Daily News , Authors Anna Louise Strong . Agnes Smedley , and Captain Evans F. Carlson , retired U. S. Marine observer-as one who went through danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep in the interior behind Japanese front lines . <P> Training Wreckers . The Chinese guerrillas , largely operating in Shansi , Hopeh and Shantung Provinces , are loosely organized into a " People 's Self-Defense Army . " Crude village arsenals make their grenades , bullets and broadswords , but much of their ammunition is unwillingly furnished by the Japanese . Clad in green cotton uniforms enabling them to melt into the countryside after a daylight raid , the guerrillas are taught to wreck Japanese troop and supply trains , ambush food convoys and attack isolated Japanese garrisons . <P> Their military headquarters , located in dozens of central villages , keep in touch with each other by telephone and wireless equipment , much of it filched from the Japanese . At their general headquarters , where a " general staff " of young officers , lent by the 8th Route ( former Communist ) Army , veteran Manchurian fighters and college students plan widespread attacks , the Associated Pressman discovered their well-thumbed textbook on guerrilla warfare : a translation of The Seven Pillars of Wisdom , by the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wrecking Trains . Pride of the guerrillas are two train wreckers , both dignified Chinese scholars , who in pre-war days occupied professorial chairs in the chemistry and physics departments of Peiping universities . They explained their technique to the correspondent . " It 's like a game of chess . Our opponent is the Japanese army engineer . He tries to checkmate every move we make in wrecking his trains , but thus far we have kept one jump ahead . " The erstwhile professors admitted they had copied Lawrence 's method of train wrecking-setting off an explosive charge under the rails as a train passed over-until they ran out of explosives . Then they used a cheaper method-pulling out the inner rail spikes , especially at spots where the tracks curved . This usually caused the tracks to spread when heavily loaded Japanese trains ran over them . <P> " Under optimum conditions it requires from one to four days for the Japanese to clear away the wreckage , " said the smiling onetime physics professor .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
