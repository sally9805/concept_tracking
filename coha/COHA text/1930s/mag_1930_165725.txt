One day rain spoiled a rodeo at Miller 's 101 Ranch in Ponca City , Okla . Turtles came out after the rain and someone had the idea of racing them instead of horses . Last week 10,000 entries arrived in poultry cars to race in the sixth annual terrapin derby at Ponca City . Their owners chalked identifying numbers on their diamond-panelled backs and put them under a big canvas hoop in the middle of a circle . Up went the hoop as the crowd shouted . Many turtles lay still , inert or stupid . Others began to move at frenzied speed but grew discouraged and lay down or remembered something and went back . A few plodded on to the outer line of the circle . First across , and winner of $7,100 was Goober Dust , owned by Mrs. Cora M. Day of Ponca City . Second prize , $1,250 , went to an anonymous turtle belonging to F. V. Huddleston of Bluff City , Kan.                   @ @
