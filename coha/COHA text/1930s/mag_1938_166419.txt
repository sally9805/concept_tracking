Last year the coral-pink prettiness of the Bermuda Islands attracted 79,856 visitors . Of these , well over 90% were Americans , but only 1,088 tourists sailed there on U. S. ships . Early this year , in an attempt to divert U. S. tourist dollars into U. S. pockets , Eastern Steamship Lines decided to run the steamer Acadia ( cruise capacity 400 ) on a weekly schedule to Bermuda , competing chiefly with the British-owned Furness Bermuda Line . <P> At busy Hamilton , island capital and chief tourist port , Competitor Furness and Canadian National Railways occupy all four berths , which meant that Eastern would have had to anchor in the harbor and ferry its passengers ashore . Best alternative was to use the harbor at sleepy St. George , where the piers are owned by the St. George Corporation . Hitch there was that there was only one hotel , the St. George , which is so regularly patronized that it never needs to advertise . Obvious solution lay in the ship-hotel idea , used successfully for years by cruise ships in Bermuda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March , to the alluring slogan " Your Ship Is Your Hotel , " the Acadia began sailing into St. George , tying up , and keeping house for its passengers . For small-budget vacationists this was just the ticket , and Eastern 's idea clicked profitably . Island innkeepers , as well as Furness Bermuda , which controls three hotels , were alarmed . They could easily imagine Bermuda harbors dotted with ship-hotels , the inns covered with cobwebs . Last June they had a bill introduced in Bermuda 's Legislature barring ship-hotels from St. George and Hamilton harbors . But when the Governor-General , Lieut. - General Sir Reginald J. T. Hildyard , opening Parliament to consider the legislation , mentioned Eastern as the chief offender , the U. S. State Department protested such direct aim at U. S. shipping , and the bill died . <P> But there are more ways than one of skinning a Yankee . In July , Furness Line boats adopted the ship-hotel plan themselves , right in Hamilton harbor . This time hotels ashore really felt the pinch . At a session of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no U. S. shipping line , carefully exempted " transit passenger ships " ( cruise ships ) , and , as a loophole in case of protests* placed a power of exemption in the hands of the Bermuda Trade Development Board . Last week in Bermuda 's Legislature , over protests from St. George merchants , this bill became a law , subject to approval of the British Colonial Office . Same day the law was passed , Furness Bermuda suavely announced abandonment of its expedient ship-hotel policy . <P> * By last week the U.S. State Department had not protested .
