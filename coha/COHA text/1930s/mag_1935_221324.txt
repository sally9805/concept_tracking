Unthinkable is it that the august New York Times would ever so far forget its reputation for impeccable taste as to print photographs of a Caesarean section . The Times is also stiffly proud of its reputation for impeccable typography . Last week its readers discovered which reputation the Times prizes more highly . On Page 1 of the Times 's Sunday Book Review section appeared a typographical botch which any country editor would be ashamed to permit in his paper-a line which showed only as a faint , undecipherable blur . The type had obviously been scraped off . Readers ' puzzlement grew to shock when , on Page 14 of the same section , they found a two-column , five-inch-high , grey smudge , beneath which was the following caption : <P> " The Lawyer 's Pedigree " <P> A Broadside Set in Type by Isaiah Thomas at the age of 6 . <P> The large grey smudge was included in an unsigned review of From ' Prentice to Patron , a biography of Isaiah Thomas , early U. S. printer . The undecipherable line was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Russia , the newly-discovered memoirs of Napoleon 's aide , General Armand de Caulaincourt* ( TIME , Dec. 2 ) . The line was at the end of a quotation from Napoleon which de Caulaincourt had offered as proof of the Emperor 's unscrupulousness in winning allies . <P> Explanation : an unrevealed number of copies of the Book Review had been printed when Someone Higher Up saw what sample of Printer Thomas ' work had been chosen to illustrate the review of his biography ; what quotation Critic Titterton , who is literary adviser for prim National Broadcasting Co. , had picked to reveal Napoleon 's character . Choosing swiftly between typography and taste , the Higher Up ordered the presses stopped at once . All copies of the Book Review already printed were destroyed . Since it was too late for costly re-plating , printers were ordered to scratch out the offending line of type with a chisel , smudge over the offending illustration with ink . <P> Inquisitive readers who searched From ' Prentice to Patron found 6-year-old Printer Thomas ' broadside to be an antique , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a series of cohabitations between such persons as a Knight , a Friar , a Nun , a Lady . <P> That part of the Napoleonic quotation which the Times let by was : " When I need any one , " he said , I do n't make too fine a point about it ; <P> The excised line : I would kiss his  --  . " <P> *The meticulous Times , throughout its review , spelled the General 's name " Coulaincourt. "
