THE CRUISE OF THE RAIDER " WOLF " - Roy Alexander-Yale ( $2.75 ) . <P> On Nov. 30 , 1916 , a trim , single-funneled , 5,809-ton German freighter , deep grey and black , slipped quietly out of Kiel , nosed through cold , thick fog toward the Norwegian coast , headed at top speed ( eleven knots ) into the teeth of the North Sea blockade . She was the commerce raider Wolf , commanded by stocky , hand some , canny Karl August Nerger . Cunningly concealed behind hinged steel side she carried a wicked assortment of 5.1 guns , torpedo tubes , machine guns , 45 : mines . Her orders : to mine the chief British colonial ports . <P> Fifteen months later , a battered , be draggled ghost ship , the Wolf again dodged through the British blockade and limped home to her base . Of all German raiders she had outlived all but one. * She had cruised 64,000 miles , through every ocean and most of the British patrols of the world . Not once had she touched port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tons . According to plan , she had mined England 's chiel colonial ports , including Singapore . And until one month before her miraculous return the British Admiralty did not even possess a description of her . <P> Until last week , English readers were in about the same case as the British Admiralty . Unlike his fellow captain Luckner 's writings , Captain Nerger 's book on his raiding exploits was not generally known outside Germany . The first account in English is by one of his prisoners . Roy Alexander , an Australian wireless operator , spent nine months in one of the two mine compartments which served as brig for the Wolfs sardined , polyglot prisoners ( 100 when he , arrived , 400 at the peak ) . <P> Through rivet holes in an after bulkhead new prisoners were shown neat stacks of barrel-sized mines ; adjacent were the powder magazines . What would happen if a mishap or an enemy shell touched that hold was something they all thought about , seldom spoke of . Other anxious moments came as they listened to the ticklish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue , corpselike light when buzzers called the crew to battle stations . <P> With such diverting thoughts , the Wolfs prisoners did not complain of the tropic heat that turned their filthy prison into a fetid Turkish bath , nor of their grim diet , nor of the dhobie itch and typhus brought aboard by Japanese prisoners , nor even of scurvy , which began to rot them on the voyage home , through a hurricane that left the Wolf leaking 40 tons of water an hour , through the ice-jammed Arctic and the dreaded North Sea blockade . Eventually they felt for Captain Nerger the respectful gratitude due a hero who had saved their lives . <P> <P> *Only other raider to return to her base was Count Dohna-Schlodien 's Moewe ( Gull ) , a converted freighter like the Wolf and deadliest German raider ( her bag was about 50 ships , including the battleship King Edward VII ) .
