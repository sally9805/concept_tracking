Year ago when Franklin Roosevelt went before Congress to describe the State of the Union he delivered a message that was far less a communication than a challenge . It denounced " entrenched greed . " " unscrupulous money changers , " " discredited special interests , " " political puppets of an economic autocracy . " those who ' " ' gang up ' against the people 's liberties . " It was called the first gun of the campaign of 1936 . <P> Last week Franklin Roosevelt again described the State of the Union to Congress , but in entirely different terms . Not one opprobrious epithet did he hurl , not one ringing denunciation . His words were of reason and goodwill , his attitude of sweetness and light . This year 's message might fitly have been described as the closing gun of the campaign of 1936 . <P> There was no need to denounce an opposition annihilated on Nov. 3 , and the way was quietly prepared for mopping up that one opponent which election had not quelled . <P> Through cheering crowds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . At the side door of the House wing , he shed his silk topper , his dark overcoat and revealed himself in his new uniform , a handsome ash-grey cutaway with trousers to match . The White House secretariat-Son James , Stephen Early , Marvin Mclntyre-racked their toppers in a row on the trunk behind the Presidential tonneau. and the official party entered the Capitol . <P> For the past half-hour , in the presence of the House and Senate assembled , Vice President Garner had been opening , Senators George and Austin . Representatives Tinkham and Fletcher counting , the vote of the Electoral College . State by State the landslide vote piled up . At the end the Vice President did not bother to announce the awesome total of 523 to 8 . <P> When Franklin Roosevelt entered on his son 's arm the crowded chamber rose and applauded not only the President of the U. S. but a conquering hero . <P> As the applause subsided , he took a firm grip on the sides of the lectern and began : " For the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a new Congress within a fortnight of the expiration of his term of office . While there is no change in the Presidency this year , change will occur in future years .
