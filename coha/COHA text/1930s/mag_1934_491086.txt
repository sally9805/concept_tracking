SHOULD Baby LeRoy get a larger salary than the President of the United States ? President Roosevelt is quoted in the public prints as believing that he should not ; and Baby LeRoy , if he could talk , would probably agree with him . Certainly the producers of Baby LeRoy 's pictures do , for they pay him , not the " reputedly fabulous " sum he has been said to receive , but a comparatively modest salary  --  when he works . Of course , personally , I do n't believe that the President said any of the things which were imputed to him about motion-picture salaries . I agree with my friend and coworker , Eddie Cantor , who said that he thought Mr. Roosevelt was too busy to know or care what Baby LeRoy or any other " immature person ' . ' was making for acting before the camera . Eddie 's theory would seem to be a reasonable one . The question of one infant 's income does n't loom as an important item in a program of national recovery . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with motion pictures , always a hot subject for newspaper ballyhoo , they received the widest possible publicity ; and as a result , we have one more highly publicized example of the exaggerated ideas which get about  --  ideas which percolate sometimes into the highest and usually best-informed circles  --  about the disproportionate size of Hollywood incomes . What Determines a Star 's Earnings IT IS true , however , as everybody knows , that 1 some motion-picture stars in their twenties and early thirties and some youthful executives do receive salaries much larger than the stipend which we allow the President of the United States . And it is an arresting fact , worthy of discussion and investigation in times like those which we are now passing through , that this should be so . Not that the question of age is in itself important . I am sure that President Roosevelt , who has shown so much progressiveness in surrounding himself with youthful advisers , would be the first to deny that services should be appraised on an age basis , especially in the motion-picture business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box-office attraction and as a technical photographic requirement . Of course , there are a few stars who could not be called " immature . " Marie Dressler is one . George Arliss is another . Even Will Rogers scarcely deserves , either biologically or mentally , the immature label . But the great majority of motion-picture stars are , and must be , young . It would hardly be fair to say that Miss Dressler should be allowed to keep her large salary and that Miss Helen Hayes should not ; or that . Mr. Arliss , because of his age , should be permitted to receive whatever his employers feel that he is worth , and that Miss Constance Bennett , because of her youth , should not . Take the contrasting cases of Will Rogers and Mary Pickford . It happens that Mr. Rogers has come into the richest earning period of his life at an age when most motion-picture celebrities are through . The value of his time has been fairly well established by activities outside the motion-picture field . It is not proposed , I take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lecturer or an ambassador of good will ; and it hardly could be expected that he should devote any part of his time to picture making  --  in which he is equally successful both as an entertainer and an influence for good  --  on a less remunerative basis . But how about Miss Pickford , who , at a very immature age , earned more money for her employers than even Mr. Rogers does , and who has also been in her way  --  as many thousands of mothers of daughters will gladly testify  --  an influence for good ? Surely , it would n't have been fair to let Will keep his earning capacity because he happened to be born in 1879 , and take Mary 's away from her because she reached the heights in her early twenties . I know good old Will would n't think it was fair . As a matter of fact , it would be just as reasonable to penalize a little girl like Janet Gaynor because she does n't weigh as much as Kate Smith or is n't as tall as Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government to pay the United States Steel Corporation twice as much for a carload of steel as it would pay the Bethlehem Steel Corporation , simply because Mr. Carnegie wore a beard and Mr. Schwab does not . I can not believe that Mr. Roosevelt has ever envisaged any such arbitrary and discriminatory regulation , or that he would tolerate it for a moment . The question of whether salaries are paid to people in their twenties or to people in their fifties , or whether they exceed the income of the President of the United States or fail to equal the income of those Wall Street bankers who unloaded on us all those defaulting bonds and disappearing stocks , is beside the point . I take it that the old Biblical saying that " the laborer is worthy of his hire " applies even in the picture business . The questions that the use of the President 's name has raised , therefore , would seem to be simply these : Do any motion-picture stars get these huge salaries ? And if so , do they earn them ? A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the first of these questions is , as you know , " They do . " That is , the big ones do . In fact , the reason given for the latest . Washington agitation about motion-picture salaries was that someone had discovered that about 400 persons in Hollywood were drawing 51 per cent . of the salaries , leaving the other 12,000 persons engaged in the film business to divide the remaining 49 per cent . I was surprised at these figures . I would have said that forty persons in Hollywood deserved to draw 51 per cent of the Hollywood income . I have in mind one man . Why beat around the hush ? His name is Irving Thalberg , who happens  --  to his great delight  --  to be the husband of Norma Shearer . Irving made 3900,000 in one year out of his job as supervising producer of one of our biggest studios . He was barely thirty at the time  --  obviously immature  --  but his company happens to be one of the few , one of the very few motion-picture companies which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the hands of a receiver . Even a political theorist might suspect that there was some relation between Irving Thalberg 's income and his company 's prosperity . There was a decided relation . The companies which he and two of his associates were called upon to direct were not making any money ; in fact , they had , as a whole , been losing money for some time ; so Irving and his two friends undertook the management on the basis of a share of the future profits , if any . Under their management the company made millions for its stockholders . Irving 's share one year was , as I have said , $900,000 ; and he earned it many times over by producing a long series of box-office successes , starting with Ben Hur and The Big Parade and coming down through Smilin ' Through and Grand Hotel . Now , I am a producer ; Mr. Thalberg is connected with a rival eons pany , but I rim willing to say that if we had four Irving Thalbergs in Hollywood , and we paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay out in salaries , we would be doing more for national // recovery  --  and , incidentally , for ourselves  --  than we could possibly do by scattering the same amount among the less highly paid 12,000 . For if it were n't for the few who get the big motion-picture salaries , the many who get smaller salaries would n't work at all . However , the stories which circulate about motion-picture incomes are so exaggerated , and the reasons for their size  --  when they are sizable  --  are so little understood that I have been moved to give you what . I believe to be the first authentic story about the income of the stars . Possibly you have read other articles on this subject . Hollywood fan writers are continually guessing at what the stars make . But no one , unless he happens to be in a position similar to mine , can give the real figures . In fact , if this article has any value at all , it comes from the circumstance that it is written from the inside . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with motion-picture production from its inception , and have , at different times , employed most of the leading figures of the screen . I know what they have received because I have signed their cheeks . Moreover , some of my fellow workers , believing as I do that the time has come when the public should know the facts , have been good enough to check my own information in order that I might state without fear of contradiction the actual salaries which leading stars are now receiving . Popularity Expressed In Dollars I T Is not easy , however , as it once was , to state the stars ' salaries in terms of so much a week . Most of the leading figures in the industry now work on the basis of so much a picture , and their earnings are naturally dependent on how many pictures they make . However , here is a list of fifteen leading stars , taken at random from the various studios , together with a statement of their weekly earnings  --  on the basis of a forty-week year  --  which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wallace Beery $5000 Will Rogers 7500 William Powell 4500 Maurice Chevalier . . . 7500 Joan Crawford . . 4000 Constance Bennett . . . 7000 Janet Guy-nor . . . 3760 John Barrymore . . . . 6500 Edward C. Robinson . 3000 Norma Shearer 6000 James Cagney . . . 2800 Richard Barthelmess . 6000 Clark Gable 2500 Ann Harding 6000 There is a story behind each one of these salaries . Clark Gable and Jimmy Cagney , who are at the bottom of the list , are among the greatest box-office attractions in pictures , but . their rise has been so sudden that they have not yet been able to capitalize their popularity on a 100 per cent basis . Richard Barthelmess , on the other hand , has built up his large earning capacity by an unequaled record of good and profitable performances . William Powell , too , has a long and honorable record behind him . Constance Bennett 's $7000 income , although it is one of the four or five largest in pictures , may be a disappointment to some of her admirers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was making about $30,000 a week . This widely repeated statement , which has done more to discredit Holly-wood sanity than any other one thing , was due to the fact that one studio induced her to make two pictures during her vacation at a price of $150,000 a picture . The vacation lasted ten weeks . Miss Ben-nett worked her head off and made the pictures . I do n't blame her . It was easy money . But that 's the way the $30,000 story started . Some stars , unlike Miss Bennett , work on the basis of a comparatively modest salary and a bonus based on the degree of success of his or her preceding picture . Marie Dressier , who is , as everybody knows , one of the biggest hits in current pictures , draws $2500 a week , plus a bonus which has amounted to a very substantial figure , because all of Marie 's pictures have been wonderful money earners for her employers . I am not at liberty to divulge the exact amount which Mae West receives , because her employers prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mystery , but I can say that her arrangement is very similar to Miss Dressler 's  --  a comparatively nominal salary and a bonus , which , based on her company 's profits on She Done Him Wrong and I 'm No Angel , should be a very large section of the United States Mint . George Arliss , one of our finest mature stars , receives $80,000 a picture for two pictures a year , a total annual income of $160,000 . A lot of money , you say ? Yes ; but Mr. Arliss ' contributions to the screen have been so notable that even if he were not a box-office attraction , which he is , I would be glad to throw in my bit , without hope of direct personal re-turn , to a nurse to keep Mr. Arliss in pictures . A hundred and sixty thousand dollars a year is tog much money for most people , but it does not begin to represent George Arliss ' value to the screen . John Barrymore is in a peculiarly advantageous position because his ability to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality enables him not only to fulfill his contract with his parent studio but to earn a substantial income during what would otherwise be idle days by appearing in other com-panies ' productions . Moreover , Jack has learned through hard experience to drive the kind of bargain which keeps his income at the maximum . When Opportunity Knocked for Gretchen r1ONTRASTED with these veterans of the stage k.J and screen is the case of Miss Loretta Young . Loretta , or Gretchen as she was then called , came into pictures because a director called up her mother to ask for her sister , Polly Ann young . " Polly is n't here , " Mrs. Young replied , " but Gretchen can come . " Gretchen came ; and she has been coming ever since . She is one of the very few girls of her age almost continuously before the public . But , of course , there is a reason . There always is ! Loretta , Young is the only girl I know in pictures who can play the romantic juvenile type , sweet and young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Youngsters of seventeen and eighteen look upon her and love her as one of themselves . Mother and father respect her for her intelligence and her acting ability . That is why she gets $2000 a week , and earns it . In my opinion , she is worth $25,000 to any picture . Loretta 's case reminds me of Eddie Cantor 's story of King George 's famous.stamp , which is reputed to he worth $50,000 . " If there were two of them , " Eddie says , " they probably would n't be worth $25,000 apiece , and if you just want a stamp , you can get one for three cents . " The reason Marie Dressler and Greta Garbo and Jackie Cooper are worth what they get to the man whose job it is to produce a successful picture is that there is only one Marie Dressler , only one Greta Garbo , only one Jackie Cooper . Jackie , by the way , gets $1300 a week , most of which is laid aside in accordance with wise California laws against the day when Jackie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now going to college on the money that was saved for him in the same way .

We 're ( Continued But the question of what these exceptional children get during the few brief years of their earning power is of small importance . Where is Wesley Barry now ? These children are prodigies , and like most prodigies , they and their incomes vanish all too quickly . Then there is the case of the actor or actress who is worth more to one company than she is to another . Ruth Etting , the radio star , is a case in point . Ruth had been very successful in making motion-picture shorts and was anxious to try her luck in a feature-length film , so she came out to Hollywood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Roman Scandals . She knew the first picture had to be good to insure other engagements , so she was willing to work eight full weeks for comparatively little money in a production which contained so many other established screen attractions , but her next picture was with another studio in Hip , Hip , Hooray , for which she received $25,000 for six days ' work . The Raw Material of Movies The explanation is a simple one . With Roman Scandals , she was one of a number of stars . She helped to carry them , to be sure , but they helped to carry her . With Hip , Hip , Hooray she was the star . Her job was to carry the picture ; and if she did it  --  I have n't seen the picture at time of writing  --  she was worth all that she received . The second studio was willing to pay through the nose because they thought they had to have something which Miss Etting had to sell . Who shall say that it was wrong , or that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't be allowed to back their own judgment with their own money ? It must be clear that what Loretta Young contributes to a certain kind of picture , what , Ruth Etting contributed to the picture for which she was needed as a star , what Norma Shearer contributes to every picture in which she appears , is a commodity  --  an essential element in the manufacture of a motion picture , just as steel is an essential selling out today . The rest of it does n't go , except we 're selling out . I would n't cut another tree up there if you gave me a million , mister . " " Lancer , " the old man said , " you 're talking like a fool . " But Jim Laneer knew he was n't when he saw Mary Ware . She understood what he meant , although he never explained it all to her . She had never looked as fine as she did then .

" ( THE END ) element in the manufacture of an automobile engine . " Salary " is the wrong word for the money they get . Norma Shearer 's present arrangement , for example , is $100,000 a picture . It is silly to call that salary . It is simply the price of the goods Miss Shearer has to deliver  --  goods without which a Norma Shearer picture could not be made . If the price seems high to an outsider , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is high , too , and the quantity is strictly limited . What the picture business needs is not lower incomes for its Norma Shearers but more Norma Shearers to pay high incomes to . It is n't the cheap picture played by poorly paid performers which makes money for the producer or the exhibitor or brings down theater prices to the public . It is the expensive , well-made picture , played by expensive , well-known stars , that fills the picture house to capacity and enables the theater man to give better entertainment for less money . I could go on indefinitely talking about the salaries of the stars , but I think I have said enough to establish a fair idea of what they are and how they are arrived at . It should not be assumed , however , that the figures I have given are net to the individual . They correspond more nearly to the gross income of a corporation , against which various known expenses must be charged before arriving at the net income available for dividends . Ma/or Operations on Salary Checks Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the first place , his contract is for forty weeks ; spread over fifty-two weeks , his salary becomes a little more than $7600 , and not $10,000 . In the second pace , he has undoubtedly made his contract with the studio through an agent  --  this is the almost invariable custom  --  and the agent is entitled to 10 per cent of all his earnings under that contract . The agent 's percentage brings the $10,000 star down into the six thousands , of which the vigilant income-tax collector collects practically half . The $10,000 star has now become a $3500 star  --  and the fun has only just begun . Of course , the star has to have a lawyer and a publicity agent and a secretary . He also has to have , or thinks he does , a manager to look after his income and his investments . In the case of " immature persons " in their twenties , this is probably a justifiable expense . In some instances , where the star is a beautiful woman or has valuable jewels or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense of a bodyguard . This personage is commoner in Hollywood than you would suspect ; and justifiably so . Then , there is the cost of photographs , clipping-bureau services , advertising in trade journals , and publicity lunches . Some people are born guests . Motion-picture actors , by virtue of their calling , are perpetual hosts . I do n't know , and I do n't suppose the stars do , just what these various expenses average . They vary greatly according to individual situations . But I estimate them at between $450 and 5500 a week . The Big Item of Fan Mail Then , of course , there is the fan-mail expense . Connie Bennett spent $12 , - 000 in one year on this item . Tom Mix , at the height of his popularity , was spending 313,000 . Two hundred dollars a week for labor and postage is a moderate estimate for this all-important item , Your front-rank star must , therefore , charge off this , along with press-agency and photographic expense , to what the manager of a commercial business would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenses of the high-priced stars , but there are certain personal expenses which are quite as inescapable . These vary greatly with the temperament of the star  --  for example , charity . There are a few prominent picture stars who have the first dollar they aver made , but most of them are extremely liberal in sharing their good fortune with others . Eddie Cantor , I happen to know , dispersed 331,000 last year in such contributions . So , although contributions to charity would not seem to be , offhand , an inescapable professional expense , in the case of motion-picture stars even more than of most public persons , the drain from this source is as inevitable as taxes , almost as inevitable as death . To begin with , the Motion Picture Relief Association collects one-half of 1 per cent from the star 's pay envelope at the source . This is not compulsory but is substantially the universal custom . The Community Chest and other local charities make their demands . And then there are the heart-rending letters from fans . Marie Dressler 's mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from admiring but insolvent picture patrons . The most frugal star can hardly get out from under these burdens at less than $100 a week . The big-hearted assess themselves for a much larger figure . All of which means , if you have been following the various deductions , that the so-called 510,000 income has shrunk to something less than $2500 ? or , in other words , that 75 per cent of a motion-picture star 's income is not income at all . What he does with the remaining 25 per cent is , to my way of thinking , his own affair . The wise actor saves what he can ; the unwise one spends more than he gets . It is that way in mostlines of endeavor . The percentage of foolish virgins may be a little heavier in the picture business than it is in the button business ; but if it is , I do n't know it , and am not especially interested to find out . What a man does with his money after he has earned it is his business . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this : Does be earn it ? As a producer , I would naturally be glad to reduce the salaries of my stars . Selfishly , I might even welcome some such salary-limiting proposal as the Washington experts have thought to impose upon the motion-picture industry . But I am convinced that the public is benefited and , therefore , in the end the entire industry is benefited by the maintenance of an open market in which the motion-picture actor may sell his wares . It has always been a recognized principle in this country that a man of talent should have every opportunity to get paid what he earned . I believe in that principle . I would rather pay a man 5100,000 a year if he earns it than $1000 a year if he does n't . I question the wisdom  --  or , for that matter , the authority  --  of any board of experts sitting in Washington to prevent . my doing it . I think perhaps I should explain , in this connection , that the studio and organization of which I am a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NRA , and that I personally have carried out faithfully and enthusiastically every regulation and mandate which the President . has deemed important to his program of national recovery . But I do not believe that the NRA or any other governmental agency , no matter how well intended , can make paying a man what he earns a crime . This would seem to be such a self-evident fact that I am inclined to look with amusement rather than resentment on the spectacle of solemn investigators pondering the size of Baby LeRoy 's salary while they leave uncured some of the real evils in the motion-picture business . By real evils I mean such things as the stock manipulations of 1929 , in which certain motion-picture promoters so unfortunately figured . Does the Star Earn His Salary ?

Hollywood producers have their faults . They make mistakes . They may sometimes be accused of driving too sharp a bargain . But I have never known any of them to be accused of being philanthropists . Mr. Louis B. Mayer does n't pay Wallace Beery $5000 a week simply because he Likes him , or Mrs. Beery , or their adopted daughter . Mr. Adolph Zukor does n't part with $4000 every week to Gary Cooper because he likes the color of Gary 's automobile . 92 THE SATURDXY EVEN IA IL , PUS ' February 17,1954 Mr. Joseph M.

The motion-picture producer pays the motion-picture actor what he has to pay him , no more , no less , based on box-office figures which furnish a weekly , almost a daily , gauge of the value of that actor 's services . I know of no business where the customers ' reaction is so rapidly recorded or where the employers of labor are more avid in reducing the outlay for individuals whose values are known to be waning . And how fast they wane ! There is , as a matter of fact , a tragic list of those who have not come back . They are still known and loved ; one good picture might put . any one of them back again on the top of the heap , but until that happens , the veriest tyro has a bettor chance than they have to land a first-class movie job .

Five years on the crest is the life of the average star , and those five years may be spotted with tremendous upheavals in the matters of personal budgets . One star , who is still a popular leading woman , is a ease in point . She came to me first at 8500 a week . Well east , she attracted favorable attention . Another studio offered her 82000 a week . When her contract ran out , it was not renewed . Today , her salary figure is around $1000 . Sometimes it may be less . Where the Ghost Walks Zigzag One actor was a victim of the talking screen .

But now  --  well , the picture he has recently made paid him just $6000 . Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for one picture ; $6000 for the next ! That 's the motion-picture business ; and that 's one of many reasons why the picture stars ' salaries are not so unconscionable as theorists would have the public , believe . But there are many other perils and pitfalls which beset an actor 's career and which necessitate his earning and saving while he may . A slight throat infection , unimportant to the average man , may ruin an actor 's career ; a slight injury to the face or figure of an actress may banish her from the screen . Two bad pictures , for which a star may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any picture career . Too many pictures may do the same thing . The public tires if it sees its favorites too often . Marie Dressler makes only two pictures a year ; Mae West only one . The actor tires , too , if forced to work continuously , even under the happiestconditions . Acting for the camera is an intense , consuming occupation . It is like working in the face of a white-hot furnace . The worker must get away every now and then or he loses his interest and enthusiasm and perspective . Wise actors know this situation , and when their contracts permit , try to conserve both their strength and their popularity , even if it means limiting their possible income . Helen Hayes , who came to me for Arrowsmith at $2000 a week , who received $50,000 for making A Farewell to Arms , has run away from Hollywood to appear on the New York stage at $1000 a week ; Charles Laughton has given up $2500 a week in pictures for $100 a week at London 's Old Vie ; and Katharine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could easily get $10,000 a week to stay in Hollywood , has gone back to Broadway to play a legitimate part at $500 a week . Even those who remain continuously in pictures try to protect themselves against a too-early death by limiting the number of pictures in which they appear . Fredric March is a good example . Ho has been making four or five pictures a year under contract to a big studio . Only recently , he has declined to renew that contract on his own terms , preferring to free-lance and make only as many pictures as he feels he can make and give the militia his best work . He should n't be criticized if his price per picture and , therefore , his weekly income is large while he is working . Fredric March is worth 875,000 a picture to any producer right now , and I believe he should got it . Seventy-five thousand dollars is a lot of money , but perhaps it is n't too much for an actor of Fredrie March 's standing to make at the very peak of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard Barthel-mess and William Powell .

But in no state is a patrolman merely thrown into his uniform and sent out to work . New York , where Maj. John A. Warner 's 669 troopers always look as if the best tailor in the city had just turned them out , maintains a school in which five short courses a year are held . It is open not only to state police but to sheriffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as to the police of other states . The subjects studied include civics , laws governing arrest , preparation of forms for criminal cases , investigations of various crimes and laws governing them , juvenile offenders and how to handle them , history of the United States and of New York , English composition , poisons , fingerprints , photography , map sketching , traffic safety , forest-fire fighting , criminal psychology , wrestling , boxing , methods of disarming , and courtesy . This school costs the taxpayers of New York State only $2500 a year . Where the Pollee Job Comes First So much for state-police training . What of their routine ? In most states they live in barracks . Michigan , New York , Pennsylvania , Connecticut , and several others make their recruits promise to break home ties completely for the first year of service , to give themselves exclusively to their jobs . In Maine the men live in barracks enough of the time to " keep the feel of soldiers , " and in Indiana barracks are under construction in several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every department ; state-police assignments are for single men . Too many city patrolmen are policemen for eight or ten hours only , and good neighbors and family men the rest of the time . The state trooper is on duty twenty-four hours a day . Thus he escapes many of the difficulties and entanglements which beset a city officer . He can give his attention entirely to the police business and , living in barracks , there will be fewer distractions and he will be under more constant supervision of his noncommissioned officers . Several states have solved the problem of political preference as it affects the individual patrolman by assigning no man to that portion of the state from which he enlisted . Thus a trooper never has to fear that he will run afoul of old friends or even of political partisans in the course of his duties . It is surprising that the majority of troopers are country boys . Capt . John C. Cleghorn , commander of Michigan 's uniformed division , believes that farm lads make better officers . " They are accustomed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Put a city boy out in some of our posts , and he 'd go crazy with the isolation . Country boys do n't mind it . Besides , give me country-bred officers any night when it comes to following a trail through the woods . They see things that a city man misses . " With politics reduced to the minimum in the ranks , the only place that politicians can press down their thumbs is on the head of a department . Unfortunately , now and then , a legislature , regretting its inability to use the police for patronage , will reduce appropriations to a point that cripples the service . That has occurred in several states this past year , but the reduced forces are carrying on , working longer hours , covering larger territories with fewer men , passing up many investigations which they should make . There 's Still Room for the Sheriff It is unfortunate that certain shortsighted sheriffs have banded together to fight the state police , seeing in them a menace to their own jobs . They do not realize that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheriff still retains important functions which the state forces can not and will not usurp . In the ideal state , with all law enforcement in the hands of state or even Federal troopers , the sheriff still would be an important civil officer . Who would serve summonses , call juries , subpmna nesses , net as an officer of the courts of law and as county jailer , if not the sheriff ? For example , in Delaware , outside the single metropolitan area , state police , under Supt. C. C. Reynolds , do all law-enforcement work , leaving to the sheriffs the handling of all civil matters . The system is harmonious and effective , and both county and state officers find enough to keep them busy . New York , which boasts the best-housed as well as the best-dressed trooper organization in the country , has found it possible in most eases to cooperate successfully with county forces . In Maine , which has only a state-highway patrol , Capt . James Hanson 's 150 patrolmen are called so often on criminal cases that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year . The interstate coordination now in effect in the East and certain sections of the Midwest proves the benefits in crime prevention and the apprehension of criminals which might result from a national system . Michigan and Massachusetts police radio stations , on the same wave length , almost nightly exchange valuable police data , while a dozen other state and city dispatch desks listen in for the information . Massachusetts , Rhode Island , Connecticut , New York , New Jersey and Pennsylvania state-police barracks are connected by an interstate teletype system . Within one minute , every police post in all these states may receive information , typewritten by telegraph , from any other post . Thus lookouts , descriptions and reports of crimes and fleeing criminals are dispatched simultaneously over much of New England and the Middle Atlantic States . Cities and counties have tied in on this system with hundreds of receiving and sending sets . In addition , the New York state police have an experimental radio station operating out of Albany by telephone line , the messages going on the air at Schenectady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state . Several other states are looking to radio in the near future . Spreading the Voice of the Law One night late in October , Radio Station WMP at Framingham , Massachusetts , called the Michigan station at East Lansing . " The inspector in charge of Troy detachment , New York state police , tells us by teletype . that he is testing his radio with a view to picking up your messages , " Massachusetts reported . " Will you put on a test for him ? " " Certainly , " Michigan answered promptly over a thousand miles of air . " Ready to start . Calling Troy , New York , on a test . Testing for Troy , New York . " ? The inspector at Troy received the signals , teletyped that fact to Massachusetts , and Massachusetts called Michigan . " Troy is receiving your signals splendidly , " the message flashed westward . " Mighty glad , " Michigan answered . " Any time we can be of service , New York , just call on us . We 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newly organized Indiana state police , testing a radio receiver in their new station near Gary , communicated with Michigan , and once more the voice of the law ignored state lines as it lifted on the air waves . Already state-wide police radio , such as is now in use throughout Michigan and Massachusetts , has reduced the chances of criminal escape by 50 per cent . Repeatedly in Michigan , particularly before the present legislature pared down the personnel , bandits have been hemmed in and captured by means of radio . A year ago , when gangsters raided the bank of Kaleva in the upper reaches of the lower peninsula , troopers , sheriffs and city police , working in machinelike cooperation , drew so tight a cordon over 250 miles of roads that the bandits were balked in four directions and finally were surrounded in a swamp . ' Forced to use the " cooperative " method of state , county , city and township police , Michigan has evolved a system in the upper end of the state which , if all officers do their duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of state laws forbidding any except police ears from having radio on police wave bands , outlaws repeatedly have so equipped their cars . To counteract this , Michigan recently has worked out a new secret code , under which , in a bandit hunt , fugitives might listen in , but would be unable to understand the code . By means of code letters and nunaL bers on the radio , and by a carefully drawn series of emergency plans , police in the less populous regions can block every avenue of escape . They do this by employing that first principle of military tactics , the use of natural barriers as lines of resistance , each series of barriers being designated by code numbers . For example : A crime has been committed in the vicinity of Alpena , on Thunder Bay . The criminals are escaping southward . The police officer in charge of the district glances at his map and quickly selects Plan D. He telephones state police radio , which in turn directs all posts to start Plan D in operation . Each post has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its telephone desk . Immediately the post notifies half a dozen sheriffs and city officers at strategic points . These in turn telephone to deputies and volunteers . There can be no error , no overlapping of authority , provided each man does his part . Within thirty minutes , every bridge , dam , railroad trestle and river ford , straight across the state from Lake Michigan to Lake Huron , is under armed guard . The rivers of north Michigan seem to have been laid out to aid the law and confound the bandit . The headwaters of those flowing west practically overlap the headwaters of the ones flowing east . Thus a tight net is woven . With escape thus cut off , fast police cruisers may " mop up " the country behind the barricade . But what of the populous regions in the south ? What of Indiana and Ohio , separated from Michigan by an imaginary line ? There are 258 individual " cross-overs " from Michigan into Indiana and Ohio , of which 176 are improved highways . Michigan has only 100 state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the southern border , great gaps still would remain unguarded . But by Michigan cooperating with sheriffs and police in Indiana and Ohio , an impenetrable wall might be built . That is exactly what these states propose now to do . In November , 1933 , one hundred progressive sheriffs and policemen from these three states met in Hillsdale , Michigan , and formulated a tri-state plan . To begin with , they discarded state lines and substituted for them the boundaries afforded by rivers and roads . Checkers to Check Crime Under the direction of Commissioner Oscar G. Olander , Michigan instituted a police plan of road numbering which will be general in the three states . When the Michigan radio notifies a car to take up position at M. 0 . 15 H. , both Indiana and Ohio , listening in , know exactly where that car is going and will deploy their own forces accordingly . The project calls for telephone as well as radio communication , and officers estimate that before a bandit car travels eleven miles from the scene of a crime , the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every sheriff 's office in the three states can know of the crime and be ready to do its part in the apprehension of the criminals . Of course , there is one rather serious flaw in the scheme . To operate properly , it must work smoothly in every county , town and village . But what of the sheriffs who are out on other jobs at the moment ? In too many jails , when the call is received , either a sheriff 's wife or a slow-thinking turnkey will be in charge . Before the sheriff can get the word and run to his post , all the threads of the system will be snarled . State police telephones , on the other hand , never are left without competent men in charge . They are available every minute of the day and night . A national police headquarters could spin a net covering not only Indiana , Michigan and Ohio , but Illinois and Kentucky , and California and Florida and Maine , and all the other states as well . Western commonwealths like Nevada and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate means of communication and cooperation with eastern officers , could in many cases be of great aid to Massachusetts and New York and their neighbors . Isolated as they are now , with several thousand miles and a thousand county sheriffs separating them , they can do little to help one another . A national bureau could coordinate these various independent state units in much the same way that the Federal Department of Justice recently Linked the sheriffs and city police of Oklahoma , Minnesota , Missouri , Tennessee and other states in the successful hunt for Machine Gun Kelly and his kidnaping accomplices . The cooperation in the hunt for Kelly was voluntary and enthusiastic , due largely to the public excitement over the case . In work-a-day operations , however , all officers know that enthusiasm and the volunteer spirit have short lives ; when back into the yard , brooding . " Listen ! " he said to a post that supported a clothesline . " You better watch out ! " He placed his left fist against the post . " How 'd you like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how I do when I fight ? " Thereupon , revolving his fists , flailing with his arms and kicking intensively , he showed the clothes post all that he had just learned from the boy in the alley . " That 's how I do when I fight ! " he said in conclusion , meaning that the clothes post would do well to let that be a lesson to it . Later , when Corbena had returned and was busy preparing the evening meal , he asked her how she 'd like to feel That on her , kiddo , and showed her how he did when he fought ; and , after that , he showed Kitty , who had made the mistake of following Corbena into the kitchen and was detained during the exhibition by closed doors . Neither Corbena nor Kitty took an interest in the new technic , even though Orvie demonstrated it again and again , every time more menacingly ; and he had almost wearied of such an audience when there came to his ears the sound of children 's voices in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that better appreciation might now be obtained , he went to the living room and there found both of his parents and also his little cousins from across the street , Freddie and Babe , who had been brought over , Orvie 's mother explained , to sup with him and spend the night . Nothing could have been more unusual ; but again little Orvie simply accepted without question an extraordinary fact apparently created by grown people and therefore without any discernible relation to other facts . His immediate response to this singular visit of little Babe and little Freddie was the contemplated effort to show them how he did when he fought ; but they were full of the movie they had seen that afternoon , and , as there were two of them and one of the two was little Babe , they were beforehand with him . they die , a national bureau can substitute authority for excitement . This bureau need have nothing to do with the choice of personnel in the various states , beyond setting up a standard of physical and mental fitness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useless , for certain states might from time to time become either too lax or too politically minded , and ruin the strength of the entire chain by inserting a weak link . Give every state its own nonpolitical force , rally them under a national crime-prevention bureau , give them police radios capable of reaching adjoining states , with secret teletype stations scattered from coast to coast , and the way of the transgressor would be particularly hard . It probably will require several years and many political battles to bring about this change in conditions . But the change is in the making . In nearly every state , groups of business and professional men are urging the establishment of state-police forces ; in spite of their opposition to a national police , both the bench and the bar , for the most part , are in favor of state constabularies , and citizens in general are finding fault with the haphazard methods which prevail in too many communities . Together , in high excitement , they told him how a cow had killed a tiger , how a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world that belonged to a lady without any clothes , bow a man without any clothes , either , lived in a tree and had a tame elephant and killed a whole lot of bad people and killed a bad leopard and had a fight with the lady 's snake too . These were only a few of the things Cousin Babe and little Freddie remembered ; they overwhelmed Orvie with shrill and bloody information , and even he himself had a baffled , dim perception that to show Babe and little Freddie how he did when he fought might at this time partake of anticlimax . At the table , Babe and little Freddie went on telling Orvie about the movie , recalling detail after detail , and , during the subsequent hour before they were all three put to bed , most of the time was wasted in oral dispute ; nobody denied Babe 's right to be the lady with the snake , but neither little Orvie nor little Freddie would consent to be the snake or the man or even the elephant  --  both of them were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and over that if the other would n't be the tiger , there was n't any use in the whole business . Bedtime found Orvie and little Freddie alternating in the two roles , with the tiger , whichever was he , loud in complaint and the snake lady near tears because of their unvarying inattention to herself . " Yes , they are , too , Aunt Clara ! " Orvie heard Babe saying whimperingly to his mother on the stairway above him , as the party went up to bed . " They 're both pf ' em just mean big ole pigs ! Did n't I a.st ' em to listen and let me be the lady a while about five million times ? " Then she added self-pityingly , offering another reason why deference should have been shown her , " Yes , and mamma 's sick or somep'n too ! " Little Orvie was so indifferent upon the matter of his Aunt Winnie 's illness ERE 'S a happy family , living on a farm            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
