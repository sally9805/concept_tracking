I BELIEVE A STORY BY BENEDICT THIELEN ry1HE sky was high and empty and clear , 1 and the thin air of the early winter was cool , but out in the Spanish sunshine it was warm , and the red tiles of the flat roof where we were sitting were warm when you touched them . We waited for something to happen , looking out from the roof toward the distant city . But nothing happened . The village seemed dead . There were none of the simple familiar sounds of daily life that you knew in villages like that . There were no footsteps on the pavements and no sound of animals , a dog barking or a donkey braying or the crowing of a cock . You did not hear the chattering voices or the laughter of the women washing clothes in the square below or the slap of the wet clothes on the stones . No one turned the creaking iron handle of the pump to draw water . When we looked up at the sky there was not even a cloud drifting across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from chimneys . The whole land was silent , but not with the resting noonday silence to which you were accustomed . The land seemed dead or waiting for death . I got up and looked over the railing down into the deserted street . " See him ? " Page called over to me . I shook my head . " I wish he 'd hurry up and find some , " he said . " I 'm getting thirsty . " Murray yawned and stretched in his chair and said , " He 's probably picking up local color . " " I 'm more interested in local liquor , " Page said . " This is getting to be a bore . " " Why do n't you join up ? " I said . He looked pained and said , " Kindly omit whimsy . " Schultz stopped polishing the lens of his camera and looked up at us . " That 's what you ought to do , Schultz , " Murray said , " get into the thick of things , instead of sitting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera . " We all laughed . " Hot chance , " Schultz said . " A fine bunch of pictures your paper 's going to get , " Murray said . " How about yourself , wise guy ? " Schultz said . " Oh , we 're different , " Page said . " We have to get the long-range point of view . Sub specie aeternitatis . " " That 's Greek , Schultz , " Murray said . " Sure , I know . " We heard footsteps running up the stairs and we all turned to look at the door which opened on to the roof from the house . Johnny stood there for a moment , out of breath from running , his face flushed , looking young and healthy . " Well ? " we said . He looked round from one to another of us . " Well , where is it ? " Page asked him . " What ? " " What ? The liquor , of course . What do you think ? " " Oh , that . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ' Thus cracks a noble heart ! ' " Murray said , and slumped back in his chair . " Listen , " Johnny said , " I 've just been out there . " He waved his hand in the direction of the city . " I tried to go on farther , but they would n't let me . But I thought maybe .. . " " Frankly , Johnny , " Page interrupted him , " I 'm disappointed in you . Have n't you ever read The Message to Garcia ? " " What ? " " The Message to Gar-r-thee-a , " Page said , " if you 're going to be a purist . Have n't you ever read that ? " " Oh , yes . But listen , I thought maybe if we tried to go on there all together , why . . . " " And that 's all the good it did you , " Page said . " Do n't you remember the moral of that stirring tale ? And if so why , when we entrust you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us , do you come back empty-handed ? " " Bad business , my boy , " Murray said . " Bad business . How do you ever expect to amount to anything in the world if you fall down on such a little thing as this ? " " I could n't find any , " Johnny said . " Oh , shameful , shameful ! " Murray turned to me . " Did n't I say the minute I set eyes on him that this lad would come to no good end ? " " That 's right , " I said . " It takes sterner stuff than that to make a great newspaper man , " Page said . " Did n't they teach you better than that at the School of Journalism ? " Murray asked . " Did n't they teach you that the first thing a demon reporter must know is that . . . " " Oh , listen , you guys , " Johnny looked round at us and laughed . " Listen , for goodness sake . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Schultz said , looking down into his camera , focussing it . " Another county heard from , " Murray said . " You two boys ought to get together . You " ? Page pointed at Johnny ? " you ca n't get near enough and old Remote Control , here " ? he pointed at Schultz'scamera ? " he gets so far away he has to use infra-red plates in his camera . Is that the word , Professor ? " " How about yourself ? " Schultz said . " Sub specie aeternitatis . " " Hie , haec , hoc , " Schultz said . " Listen , for God 's sake , " Johnny said , " do you fellows know there 's a war going on ? " " No , is there ? " Page looked up at the sky . " Where is it ? " Johnny waved toward the city . " Over there . Everywhere . " Page began to sing , " Over there . . . everywhere . " " There 's always a war going on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop to think of that , Johnny ? " " What do you mean ? " " What I say . There 's always a war going on . Most people do n't know it , but it 's true . Who ever paid any attention to the Chaco war ? Who knows it when they 're defending democratic institutions in Salvador or Honduras ? And when all else fails there 's always China . " " Never a dull moment , " Page said , shaking his head . Johnny looked slowly at each of us in turn . " That 's true though , Johnny , " I said . " I know , but . . . " He looked puzzled and young . He looked terribly young . For a few moments none of us said anything , watching him . " But this one 's different , " he said finally . I got up and went over to look down into the street . It was still empty and absolutely silent . I looked at the house across the street . Part of one wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a white china pitcher on it , unbroken , and a crucifix behind it , still on the wall . Next to it was a bed partly covered with a red-flowered counterpane . The counterpane was charred and torn , and as I looked at it one shred of it moved a little . I had n't noticed before that there was a slight breeze . I wondered who had lived in the house . I had stayed in rooms like that in this country when I came here for my vacation . They were clean and cheap and the people were decent and simple , and when you got to know them and they got over their first suspicion of you , you and the man would treat each other to drinks , to brandy or wine , in the evening after dinner at the caf ? . It was the same in some other country , the only things varying being the drinks . In Germany it would be beer , and in Italy it would be grappa , and in Corsica it would be cedratine or pastice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home in the country it would be corn or applejack or rye . But the people were all the same . They all thought the same and laughed over the same things , and their wives , if you were a man alone like me , would look at you in the same two or three different ways  --  coyly or modestly or boldly . If they were old women they would fix up the same sort of hot compresses for your cold or bring out the same kind of homemade remedy for a stomach-ache for you to gulp down , herb-bitters or ginger or infusions of camomile or verveine . I turned round again and joined the others . " But it really is different , " Johnny was saying . " You know that as well as I do . You just think you have to wisecrack about everything , but you know as well as I do that . . . " " Yes , of course , Johnny , " Page said . " Quite . " " No , really , no fooling . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than anything that 's ever happened before . Or for a few hundred years , at least . Why , it 's a question of whether . . . " " Certainly , Johnny , " Murray said . " You 're quite right . We quite agree with you. ? " But how can you just sit here then and  --  and wait , with things going on like this ? " Page and Murray and I looked at each other for a few seconds . Schultz started fiddling with his camera . " Well , we 're not running this war , Johnny , " I said . " We 've just got to wait . And this is a good spot to wait in . We can see what 's going on from here and . . . " " Oh , hell , I know . " He looked impatient and walked over to the railing and then back to us . " I know , but I should think you 'd want to he there  --  right in it , I mean . " " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why ? " He looked surprised . " Why , why so you can do something . So you do n't just sit and look on while  --  while things like this are happening . My God , I 'm getting sick of just looking on and waiting and never . . Hell , I was n't even old enough to get in the last war . " " That certainly was tough luck , " Murray said . " My , my ! " " Oh , I know , you 're cynical about it and I suppose you 're right , but . . . " " It 's barely possible , " Murray said . " What is ? " " That we 're right in being faintly cynical about it . " " Oh , I know it was all  --  all futile , but still . . " " But still ? " Page said , softly . " Well , it was an experience , was n't it ? It was n't just waiting for things to happen . It was doing things . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what I mean . I want to get the real flavor of it . I want . . " " The flavor of dead meat ? " Murray said . " You can get that in Chicago . " I looked at Johnny and then I looked up again at the sky . It was still blue and empty of clouds and in the silence that there was just now I might have been looking up at the blue sky near here a few years ago when I came here on my vacation . Or I might have been looking up at the blue sky above wheat fields that I used to see when I was young . Or I might have been looking up at the blue sky above what was left of a village whose name I have forgotten , near Soissons . That was also when I was young , although not as young . We had sat on the banks of the canal in the hazy sun-shine of early spring and eaten saucisson d'Arles and drunk white wine  --  which , when I think of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good then because we were young . " But unfortunately , " Page was saying to Johnny , " although they broke through the enemy line all right , someone had neglected to see that the reinforcements were there . In fact , the reinforcements were eighteen miles away still . It was a slight error in timing . " " Casualties ? " Murray said , raising his eyebrows and looking bored . Page gave a short laugh and waved his hand . " Oh , some sixty or perhaps sixty-five thousand men . " " Negligible , " Murray said . Johnny shook his head , looking troubled . " Of course that 's terrible , but . . . " " The Dardanelles was another neat piece of work , " Page said . " And in Russia there were n't quite enough shoes to go round . " " All in all , " Murray said airily , " it was a rather fascinating war . But then it 's natural that it should be since it was the War-to-End-War . " " And to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " " Sorry , " Murray said . " It slipped my mind for a moment . But then this war is supposed to have something to du with Democracy too , is n't it ? " " Well , now in this case it 's really . . . " Johnny began . Page interrupted him , " What was the word again ? Oh , yes : different . " Murray pointed up to the sky with one finger , looking solemn , and said , " The voice of the people is the voice of God . " We all laughed except Johnny . There was a moment 's silence . A sound fell into the silence . It was the first sound that had come from the street or the land or the sky . We all looked up , listening to the faint distant throbbing of the planes , trying to see them in the intense clean blue of the sky . Murray crouched down in his chair , cowering , lifting one arm over his head . " Please , God , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't pay any attention to him , looking up into the sky , straining his eyes to see the planes . The sound came nearer . I looked from the sky to Johnny . The sun was shining in his face . If I had had a son he might have been about Johnny 's age . I remembered when I was his age , looking up into the blue sky to see the first planes come over . They seemed hardly to move , hanging suspended up there in the round and empty sky . Only the changing tone of the sound showed that they were coming nearer . I envied the aviators then , running out , buckling their leather coats and their helmets , perhaps having a quick shot of liquor , jumping into their planes and roaring off , straight into the sky , leaving the earth behind them . They were all kids too . Most of them were even younger than Johnny . The younger they were the better the generals liked it , especially in the aviation . Now the planes were almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but alive and trembling with the beating of their engines . Johnny looked down at us for a second or two , then up again into the sky . I saw his lips move , saying something , but I could n't hear what it was above the sound of the planes . I looked at the others and then we all looked at Johnny . Gradually the noise moved away from us , becoming fainter as the planes neared the city . Page yawned , lighted a cigarette and said , " Now the people will flock for shelter to the subways , under the impression that they 're bombproof . " " Are n't they ? " Johnny asked him , still following the flight of the planes . Page pursed his lips , shaking his head , and drawled , " No  --  o . " " There are some nice pictures there too , " Murray said . " And the museum makes a fine target . It 's set in the middle of a park . " " But as our young friend here so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war is different . ' So that makes everything all right . " " Well , it is different , " Johnny said . " There are principles here . " " True , Johnny , true , " Page said . " You have the long-range point of view . You . . . " " Oh , hell , do n't be so hardboiled , " Johnny said . " Ca n't you take anything seriously ? " Page raised his eyebrows and looked at us and then back at Johnny . " Do n't . . . well , ideals mean something ? " Johnny said . " Are n't there some things that are worth fighting for ? " " I do n't know , " Page said . " I 'm not an idealist . So I 'm really not in a position to know . " " You have to believe in something , " Johnny said . " Do n't you ? " Page nodded his head . " Well , what do you believe in ? " Johnny asked him . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held up his hand . " Listen " We all stood there for a few moments without moving . We heard the distant sound coming closer , not in the sky now , but on the earth . The sound of marching feet came closer , rhythmic , dull on the earth , then , gradually , nearer , harder , sharp and ringing on the cobbled street . Johnny ran to the edge of the roof to look down . We followed him . Schultz unscrewed the telescope-lens from his camera and began to take pictures of the men as they went past . I watched them moving against the wall of the house across the street , their heads moving just below the crucifix that was still hanging on the wall , above the bed with the red-flowered counterpane . Now and again one of the men glanced up . Their faces were all more or less alike . They all looked tired . Except that they seemed more tired now , they looked like men that I had leaned up against bars with , drinking wine or beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in whose houses I had slept . One of them reminded me of a man named Gus who was a carpenter in our town at home . Johnny suddenly turned round , facing us . He looked from one to another of us , then he ran across the roof to the door that led down into the street . " Hey , Johnny ! " I called after him , but he paid no attention to me , not even turning round . For a few seconds we heard his footsteps running down the stone stairs , then they were covered over and lost in the other footsteps that were marching down the narrow street . We turned back and watched the men below until the last one of them was gone and the street was deserted once more . Then we sat down again , looking out toward the distant city and waiting for things to start happening .
