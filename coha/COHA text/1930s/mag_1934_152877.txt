Anyone watching the sky on a clear night is likely to see two or three meteors . As flaming bits of matter they usually disintegrate and disappear scores of miles up . Far less frequent are meteors big enough to make a daytime display and send fragments visibly hurtling to earth as meteorites . Yet within 24 hours last week two such phenomena caused excitement on opposite sides of the U. S. <P> One afternoon a metallic mass swooped in a long arc over Maine and Massachusetts . Groundlings saw its orange-red path , heard a mighty rumbling and hissing . Somewhere above the Massachusetts coastline the meteor exploded . At Salisbury Beach a crowd of Emergency Relief workers saw a fireball drop into the sea , cringed as another fragment thudded into the ground a scant 100 ft. away . One worker hastened to the spot , found the meteorite too hot to handle . A man near Newburyport saw a fireball with a 15 ft. trail splash into the ocean a half-mile from shore . Over Cape Cod a cloud of smoke which obscured the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared to have fallen in the water or on land . Only meteorite recovered was the Salisbury Beach fragment . When cool enough to pick up it was found to be a pitted , fused , 1-lb. mass . Astronomers at Harvard Observatory eagerly accepted it for analysis . <P> Next morning at dawn a United Airliner with eight dozing passengers was flying west over Solano County , Calif. , at 7,000 ft . Co-pilot Archie Anderson had the wheel ; the pilot was in the passengers ' cabin . Suddenly Anderson saw a great dazzling ball in his path which he afterward said was as " big as a house . " Instinctively he whipped his plane into a bank . The passengers snapped awake and the pilot rushed forward in time to see the meteor shatter like a mammoth bomb . Glowing fragments streamed past , plunged earthward . The plane was unharmed . But on the ground a truck driver who saw the meteor telephoned police that a burning airplane was falling . California astronomers thought it likely that the phenomenon was , in reality , miles away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plane and killed the occupants , it would have been the first incontrovertible instance of such hail from outer space causing loss of human life . No one knows whether the mountainous mass that shook North Central Siberia in 1908 , or the prehistoric fall that dug Meteor Crater 4,000 ft. wide in Arizona , killed anyone or not . But several close shaves are well known to connoisseurs of meteoritics . In 1827 a man was injured by a fall at Mhow , India . In 1836 cattle were reported killed by a meteoric shower in Brazil . In 1847 two iron meteorites totaling 85 Ib. plunged through the roof of a room in Braunau , Bohemia where three children were sleeping . In 1917 a 150-lb. stone fell within the town limits of Colby , Wis . In 1924 a 14- Ib. stone hit a Colorado highway a few feet behind a funeral procession . Last year in France a burning farmhouse in which three persons perished was thought by neighbors-but not proved-to have been fired by a meteorite . Colorado 's Harvey Harlow Nininger , meteor expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question of time before a catastrophe unquestionably involving human life will be caused by a meteoric fall .
