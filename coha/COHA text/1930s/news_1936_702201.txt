txt Tracking Criminals The current strong-arm campaign against the gangster scourge has revealed the significant fact that the sciences of criminology and physiognomy are closely allied . As each of the big gangsters was detected and tracked down it was discovered that many had resorted to plastic surgery , which made it more difficult for the various government men to track down these criminals . In the light of this , I am surprised that the Department of Justice , which has taken pains to avail itself of the services of scientists , chemists , biologists , psychologists and various other professional men , has not the foresight to include plastic surgeons on its staff . They are the only men who can tell immediately the synthetic from the real ; the only ones who can really detect the criminal under the reconstructed face . JAMES STOTTER . New York , Oct. 28 , 1936.
