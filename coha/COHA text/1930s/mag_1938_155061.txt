The day after the recent Memel election , Lithuania 's President Antanas Smetona was inaugurated for his fourth term , remarked " we small countries must be careful . " Since the election-in which Menial 's Nazi party with a " Back to the Reich " slogan , won 25 out of 29 seats in Memel 's semi-autonomous assembly-President Smetona has had to be more than careful . Adolf Hitler likes Smetona 's most potent political rival , Augustine Valdemaras , and Nazis have pressed for his inclusion in Lithuania 's Cabinet . <P> Valdemaras , known as the " Firebrand of the Baltic , " was Lithuania 's Premier and dictator from 1926 to 1929 , when he was ousted by Smetona . In 1934 he was sentenced to twelve years ' hard labor for an unsuccessful coup d ' tat , was later allowed to go to France where he has been living as an exile . Known as a Germanophile and Fascist , hardheaded , stiff-necked Augustine Valdemaras is also bitterly anti-Polish . Back in the late twenties he campaigned so vigorously for the return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marshal Pilsudski finally asked him point-blank in a League council meeting : " Is it peace or war ? " Also of interest to Hitler is the fact that Valdemaras was associated in 1917 with a Ukrainian Mission which came to Berlin seeking German backing for an independent Ukrainian state , an idea that suits Germany today . <P> Last week hard-pressed President Smetona decreed a six-month emergency period " for the protection of the state . " Students at Kaunas , Lithuanian capital , rioted against the Government ; anti-Semitic outbreaks occurred there and at Memel . At Memel , the Directory dismissed Lithuanian State police , replaced them with Memel Nazis . The day did not seem far off when Nazi agents , using Memel as a base , may harass President Smetona into resigning or recalling Valdemaras . In either case the probable result will be the same : the Lithuanian Government will follow Hitler 's orders , will accept German annexation of Memel , and , with Vilna held before it as bait , will like Czecho-Slovakia become a stooge for Germany . <P> <P> * Poland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a League commission in 1920 , two days later seized the city , has held it ever since .
