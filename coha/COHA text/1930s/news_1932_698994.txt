txt Water for Refrigeration . To the Editor of The New York Times : At present the city is charging $2.50 a year for water used in a 4-cubic foot mechanical refrigerator . An actual test under normal temperature will show consumption at the rate of 7,500 cubic feet a year when the refrigerator is used . Bills rendered by the New York Water Service Company , whose charges are based on actual meter readings and rates under control of the Public Service Commission , show a consumption of approximately 9,000 cubic feet per annum per box . In other words , customers on New York Water Service lines pay approximately $9 per annum per box . Customers on the city water lines pay a flat rate of $2.50 for the same size box . The difference multiplied by approximately 120,000 refrigerators would make quite ' a sizable additional income for the city in this time of stress .
