txt A few hours after the Cabinet had met to discuss an armament expenditure of at least ? 500,000,000 in the coming financial year , the British Government today announced new measures of civilian defense that showed it did not take too literally Chancellor Adolf Hitler 's forecast of " a long period of peace . " Among the announcements quietly made to the House of Commons was one by Sir John Anderson , Minister for Civilian Defense , that arrangements had been made for decentralizing the government immediately in an emergency by handing over power to regional commissioners for twelve areas into which England , Scotland and Wales would be divided . Most of the commissioners will be appointed at the beginning of March , when all war plans of the various government departments will be supplied to them . In case of war , each section will be run as a self-contained unit , with the commissioner as a virtual dictator . The ordering of 1,200,000 gas masks for babies , the provision of 200,000 extra hospital beds " in the first twenty-four hours of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a week 's food reserves  --  these were other announcements to the Commons that showed the government was still fearful of an air attack at short notice There has been no slackening of the British defense effort in all its aspects in spite of the " reassuring " passages of Herr Hitler 's speech , which have brought such relief to the Stock Exchanges . On the contrary , Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and his government are still proceeding on the assumption that a " totalitarian war " may come before long , although they intend to do everything possible to avert it . Added point was given to these defense preparations tonight by the issuance of ? an agreed communiqu ? in London and Berlin announcing definitely that Germany intended to " exercise ' her right " to build up to Britain 's submarine tonnage . The communiqu ? gave no reason for the German decision , although the British Admiralty delegation that visited Berlin last month had tried unsuccessfully to discover what Germany 's reasons might be . The fact that the communiqu ? was issued only today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost a fortnight ago indicated that the British Government had been trying to get a satisfactory explanation from Berlin . It had hoped to obtain some excuse or justification that might make the German submarine building look less sinister . But it failed and the pill had to be administered to the British public tonight without any sweetening whatever . Announcement that gas masks would be provided for babies repaired one of the " deficiencies " of the preparations of last Autumn when 30,000,000 gas masks were issued at a total cost of ? 4,000,000 but none was issued for children under 5 years of age . Air raid wardens in every part of the country have been distributing special cardboard cartons in the past few days so that the gas masks already issued shall not be damaged by dirt or dampness . Today Sir John Anderson told the Commons that the government had had great trouble in finding a suitable mask for babies . " Various types of apparatus for the protection of infants from the risk of gas poisoning have been evolved from time to time , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " During the last six months , however , a satisfactory device has been developed for infants up to 2 years of age . " The production of all parts has already commenced with the exception of one , which is being pushed forward with all possible speed . This remaining part will be produced by mass production methods . Mass production has been commenced in such large quantities as to overtake in a short time the production of the other parts . " Similarly a special type of respirator has been developed in the past ' six months for infants over 2 years of age and ' ts purchase is being arranged . " " How long will it be , " asked George Bellenger , Laborite , " before the respirators for young children are issued ? " " I 'd rather not say definitely , " Sir John replied . " The total number ordered is 1,200,000 . " The news of the hospital space available for air-raid victims was announced by Walter E. Elliot , Minister of Health , in a written reply to a questioner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide 200,000 extra beds on the first day of war by sending existing hospital patients home and putting additional beds and equipment in wards . " Another 100,000 could be found later , " he wrote , " by using ancillary parts of hospitals not at present used as wards . To enable these plans to be put into operation , considerable quantities of spare beds , bedding and other equipment have been obtained and are on order . " The next in this series of announcements came from Oliver Stanley , President of the Board of Trade , who said he could " see no objection " to the purchase by every householder of " small reserves of , suitable foodstuffs equivalent to about one week 's normal requirements for use in an emergency . " " Household reserves of ' this kind would constitute a useful addition to the total stocks in the country , " said Mr. Stanley . " I must make clear that household reserves might be requisitioned by the government if the government considered it necessary in the public interest . Householders will recognize that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantities of foodstuffs in peacetime and food hoarding . in time of war . " Mr. Stanley added that special measures were being taken to insure the continuity of water supply " in an emergency " and that when the government had counted the storage capacity of household tanks there would be no need for individual households to store water . These samples gave some idea of the prodigious work being done by government departments in an attempt to protect the civilian population of this country against air attack . Meanwhile , Mr. Chamberlain announced he had received a report from the advisory panel of businessmen appointed last December saying that the work of rearmament was going on " with efficiency and foresight . " The committee reported , according to Mr. Chamberlain , that the " magnitude of the effort which has been and is being made is altogether insufficiently realized by the country as a whole " and that most of the gaps disclosed last September were being filled as rapidly as possible .                @ @ @ @ @
