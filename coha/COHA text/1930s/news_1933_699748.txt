txt SAN FRANCISCO , May 4 . ? When . the Assembly at Sacramento voted yesterday to sustain Governor Rolph 's veto of the race track bill the action was not ap endorsement ' of the versatile Executive 's high stand on what he described as " moral " grounds . Backers of the bill who were sufficiently strong to put it through both branches of the Legislature with comfortable majorities do not take the Gover ? nor 's moral arguments seriously .. Nor did they try to override him veto . On the contrary they an , pounced that they were quite cone tent to have the veto sustained . For such action clears the way for a new bill which will put the race track proposition on the ballot for the special election to be held in 1 June . A companion piece on the same 1 ballot will be a referendum on the 1 repeal of the national prohibition . I This will come before the voters in the form of the election of delegates Ito the State convention to express California 's will on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note of the campaign . The race track proponents look to this to sweep their proposal for legalized tracks on to a victory which the once liberal but now highly moral Governor will have no power to veto . Action Amused Public . The California public has probe ably not been deeply stirred by the race-track issue . Had the proposal been beaten in the Legislature there would have been no popular uprising in protest . But the risibilities of the public were profoundlyagitated. when Governor Rolph killed the bill on moral grounds . That was an entirely new role in the public life of the picturesque Executive whose whole career has been an appeal to " liberalism , " and . a denial of the philosophy which holds it the business of government to regulate the private lives of citizens according to the code of the " unco guid " in matters which are not positive evils . Mr. Ralph 's appeal has been to the California tradition that life is a joyous experience , that puritanical restrictions on gayety are not justified in themselves and that the individual is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public or private rights of others . There is no denial of the fact that the Governor was still firm in his ancient faith when the bill was introduced to legalize pari-mutuel betting on horse races and to abolish the bootleg - betting that is now carried on at Tanforan without benefit to the public treasury . Light From San Simeon . The bill as it passed the Legislature would abolish the evasive option system and put the dog tracks out of business . Consternation reigned in legislative and horse circles , however , when , after the passage of the measure , Governor Ralph was summoned to San Simeon for an interview with William Randolph Hearst , whose newspapers had waged a campaign against the measure . Mr. Hearst operates five newspapers in the two metropolitan centres of the State and Governor Ralph is an active candidate for re-election . Later the Governor voiced a belief that the bill which he had at first approved was unconstitutional . Attorney General Webb , asked for an opinion by the legislative proponents of the bill , declared it constitutionally sound . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor 's change of front they did not fail to make the point that Mr. Hearst 's papers give voluminous publicity to news of the illegal tracks now in existence . The reply to this was the disappearance of the " dope sheet " from all the Hearst papers , which now content themselves with printing the entries in each dog and horse race in the order in which they are picked by the dopesters . But against ' all argument and urging Governor Rolph stood firm . California , he said , had twice voted against race track betting . The reply to this was that California had twice voted to uphold the State dry law but that since then public opinion had so swerved against the rule of conscious rectitude that last November the law was repealed by a majority of 800,000 . The Governor was adamant for righteousness . In his veto Message he confessed his love for the horse , but as between the stable and the home he took his stand with the home .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
