Along the poplar-flickering roads south of Paris last week rolled two camions each bearing an enormous head . They were bound for the little village of Le Mas-Rillier , which has sunned itself for 2,000 years on a mountain top near Lyons , overlooking the Rhone Valley . The heads were those of a Virgin and Child . Joined to concrete bodies , they will complete the largest statue in the world . <P> Notre Dame de Sacre Coeur was designed in simple , flowing lines by Georges Serraz of Paris , a grey little man who is considered France 's finest religious artist . Cost of his colossus was 1,000,000 francs , raised during the past two years by the energetic cure of Le Mas-Rillier . Holding the child high in her arms and gazing down , the Virgin of Le Mas-Rillier will face south over 100 miles of the French Alps . Her weight : 440 tons . Her height with foundation : 174 feet. * <P> <P> *Other heights : Statue of Liberty , 151 feet ; Christ the Redeemer ( on Mt . Corcovado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : San Francisco 's St. Francis , 180 feet ; Lenin ( atop the Palace of the Soviets , Moscow ) , about 328 feet .
