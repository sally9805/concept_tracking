Miss Graham and Mademoiselle MISS Martha Graham began the season with a packed theatre and great applause . Some new compositions appeared , and among others repeated was the " Primitive Mysteries , " the dance with the , pupils , in three parts , in which the votary , the priestess , the goddess ' holy one , or whatever you choose to call that white figure , goes through form after form and meaning after meaning . Of this composition I can say that it is one of the few things I have ever seen in dancing where the idea , its origin , the source from which it grew , the development of its excitement and sanctity , give me a sense of baffled awe and surprise , the sense of wonder and defeat in its beautiful presence . By this I mean to imply a contrast with such a fine dance , for example , as Pavlova and Nijinsky in a bacchanal . Beautiful as that may have been , one could easily see how the idea might come from a vase painting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predictability , so to speak , in no way lessened the excellence of that dance : I am only trying to express the other sense , of the wonder at creation and the feeling of an unimaginable origin and concentration . Tennyson observed that of all things sculpture is one of the most difficult to describe . Dancing is even more so . We may , with writing talent , find some equivalent in words for a dance we write of . But this is a recreation of essence . It is not description . You could say , in fact , that the more exactly you describe such a dance composition the less you convey it to the reader . I might , however , be somewhat useful by another method . " When I first saw Miss Graham dance I had a feeling of insistent denial that I resented ; too many things were cut away that life knows to be enchanting or profound . I thought I saw that this was a dancer who , having heard much of reaching to the heavenly sphere , had brains enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived does indeed move within the heavenly sphere , it must , nevertheless , find first an earth to stand on . In sum , she knew that to look up at the stars you must have and use a head , eyes , neck , backbone and feet , plus the ground under you ; it was not a mere matter of your feeling inside you that you were looking up at the stars , as if a feeling were anything people care about unless it achieves a form , a body in which it lives . There was , then , in Miss Graham 's dancing this kind of stubborn elimination . It did show a sincere and genuine nature , but a nature not yet flowered in culture and freedom . There was also too great an absence of movement : the dancer 's technique involved steps and positions , but the transition , which is the living element , was close to nil . From this early state , all true , at the time , to the artist and thus far right and moving on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You feel that her art has only just begun , and that one of the remarkable things about it is that this fact is even clearer to the artist than it is to you . There are , as every artist knows , a thousand ways to go forward by means of cheating surfaces void of inner solidity ; the refusal of them is the first hallmark of an artist . From this most independent and self-imposed conviction of her present stage of development , proceeds the freshness of Miss Graham 's work . She knows that the first young stages of an artist have no freshness ; they have only fresh feeling , or egotism or exhibitionism that is but partially expressed in form that is either casual or traditional or imitative . As the artist 's work grows its freshness is present . Maturity alone brings it alive , into a complete life . Maturity implies not only the freshness and immediacy of feeling or idea ? whatever you want to call it . It implies also that the technique to express it is safe , complete . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on for no little while merely by remembering and repeating these already achieved forms , which , because of their rightness once , carry about them still something of their first desire and light . It will be worth more to try and put down , rather than a report or attempted picture of Miss Graham 's dance , some indication of what one can see is the process of her creation . Her dancing is pictorial , necessarily , since one understands it through the eyes . It is not pictorial in the sense of being representative , but pictorial as is an abstract painting or a pattern in design . She must begin , I should say , not with either a pictorial representational idea ( some scene or personage ) or with a dramatic idea : her first idea will be more like that of a designer of patterns , lines , angles , rugs , tiles , fabrics , what you will , or like the basic outlay of what will later be a painting . From this pattern or single form there will develop other forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visually abstract and more a subject , more a literary or a psychological meaning , and go on from there , perhaps , even to a title for the composition , " Incantation , " say , or " Dolorosa " or " Dithyrambic . " Her dances have been so far both pic torial and dramatic , as music is , not as , for instance , a picture of Velasquez is , or a scene in a play . Miss Graham 's present program is , I think , too long , the first part especially , in which there are so many dances of the same general kind . If you have full faith in the dancer , you get an unpleasant sense that , with so much time given to it , more must be being said than you are taking in . In the " Rapture " Miss Graham introduces toward the end a direct dramatic motive . It is a good development in her art , though this dance itself would be improved if dramatic motifs came also earlier in its movement . There has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a concentration on the stark pattern for the design-idea of the composition . The benefits of this ? for a period of time , that is ? are manifest in the fine cleanness and purity of her dancing ; we have the sense that , whatever may have been left out , nothing has entered a composition that has not grown into it organically . It is important to note that in Miss Graham 's dancing there is a conscious sincerity ; and that this contrasts greatly with what so often appears in the German dancers ? Miss Wig-man , for example , or Mr. Kreutzberg ? where there is not rarely a kind of false simplification , in sum , German theory applied most obviously . Stepping out roundly in one sole sweep is not necessarily simple ; in these German dancers it is often the patent application of sheer psychology , and therefore elaborate in spirit and essentially impure . There is no reason why more of the lyric and dramatic should not , in her own due season , take their place in the pure form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note on Miss Graham 's dancing . Certain reiterations are manifest , the return of a form , a tone , or rhythm . This seems to me a very wise tendency . The lack of reiteration is one of the things that send so much modern art of into nothing . There is not only the hypnotic effect of repetition and the satisfaction , as close as the pulse beat , of recurrence . A thing must return on itself as a part of its life process . The dance especially , involved so immediately with life , is gone as soon as it is finished , just as life is gone as soon as it ceases . Underlying all that is alive is the compulsion toward return . " Mademoiselle , " the French comedy or rather farce that Miss Grace George and Miss Alice Brady have brought to town , goes well enough , Mr. Matthews and others included , except for Miss George . The story told is of family , everybody busy with profession , politics , society and fashion , into which comes Mademoiselle for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The young daughter turns out to be enceinte , Mademoiselle takes her to the country , ultimately claims the child to be hers , and departs , while the young lady and her family go prancing on . It is weeks since this production appeared , with its sprightly entertainment and its gloomy central puzzle as to what Miss George might be thought to illustrate in her portrayal of the governess . None of it all remains of interest now except this one point , still significant . There in Mademoiselle was a role full of wit and variety and French bourgeois hard sense and honest , canny , not unprofitable goodness . There was this sterile old maid suddenly professing a lapse at her age into parturition , to the dismay of the society lady and everybody else ; calling in her brother , an engineer , as the advising physician , sticking him for six percent on the loan she makes him , carrying off all claims to the baby ( whose father has conveniently been killed in an accident , such are the benefits of farce ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and diversity lie in this role and this situation ! But Miss George enters like a gloom , nothing about her moves ; Chaucer would have said that of this " visage children were afeered " ; even the six-percent hold-up motif was like Cerberus of blackest midnight born . The conception of the role ? since we must have wise analyses ? could be taken only as a case of repression . Whether Miss George meant this or not , the point remains the same : I am discussing the fright in our theatre at what we take as serious , the lack of all deviltry , all joy , the death of the saucy pleasures implicit , along with the elusive pathos , in a situation . After all , the dry old baggage got the young fool 's baby , plus a healthy life in the country ; hungry as her life had made her , harsh perhaps , and of a dry , safe pattern and conformity , she carried off with her the bread of life for which this fashionable household had not eyes or nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a role have been Passed up for a mere raven cliche of repression ? This is a Point concerning our theatre more indicative than we might think . As if no other player lived for such a part ! I can only think of the theatre 's waste , and how it deserves all the blows it gets . There is Madame Maria Ouspenskaya who with a slight alteration to account for her accent , could have given such comicality , grotesquerie , variety , crispness , pathos and irony to such a role in such a story , as would have been a joyous masterpiece . How sound , how fantastic and wry , how rich and racy that governess role might be , what a satirical center and to us all what a stung heart ! Sometimes we could ask the theatre not to try to think , or at least not to think unless life can be a zest to it and art can laugh and cry with the incongruous ripple and sigh of nature .
