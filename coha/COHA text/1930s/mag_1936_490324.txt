DROP by drop the oil from the liver of the halibut and the cod fights to check the town 's infection , and ephedrine is a mist in the nostrils . It 's no use . Grippe is a pestiknee , and half the town goes to bed with a sore throat , a burning eye , and a carton of disposable tissue . We caught sight of a small item in the papers saying that among the grippe sufferers was Jimmy Durante , who played a performance recently with a temperature of 102 ' , his great nose a veritable hippodrome of germs . His plight , although grotesque , seemed average . What man has not found himself , at one time or another , with a fever raging in his veins , an elephant kneeling on his chest , and in his ears the sounds of distant laughter ? WE caught our cold in the National Theatre , waiting at the top of the coasting hill for Ethan Frome and Mattie Silver to start their long , sad descent . The chill which we took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which these two grief-sprent lovers arranged themselves on the sled . Instead of sitting up , clutching each other ( as Mrs. Wharton specified ) , or lying down belly-whoppers , one on top of the other ( a conceivable alternative ) , they startled everybody by reclining side by side on the sled , in the sort of classic semi-recumbent pose which we once saw Raymond Duncan take before a group of ladies . It is clear to us now why the Ethan and Mattie of the play did n't die . They did n't die because they most certainly fell off the sled near the top the hill and never got within a mile of the old elm at the bottom . Not even Donna Fox could have fetched the elm that way , much less Raymond Massey . THE National Broadcasting Coin1pany informs us , by mail , that in the limpid beauty of Dorothy Lamour 's person is embodied all the silken allure and mystical enchantment of the eternal woman ; and that to see her is to look upon a scented loveliness that holds the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some exotic flower . That may he . But the raw fact is , we ca n't see her . The radio people , deep down inside themselves , know that , and are disturbed about it . One can understand the way they feel . They sign up a beautiful star , and what good does it do them ? For all anybody cares they might just as well sign up an old fright . As yet nobody in the radio audience has ever looked upon the limpid beauty of a performer 's person . Television promises us that , but television has hit certain snags ; there are practical difficulties in the way of transmitting satisfactory images . Our private theory is that television waves , instead of adapting themselves to the curve of the earth , go straight as a die and bring up short against the horizon . We have to laugh when we think of Dorothy Lamour 's scented loveliness bumping along over the Alleghenies , like a disabled mail plane . AMONG the changes that have come over the world is the change in press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to have lots of time on their hands , and their attitude to ward members of the press was fawning , Nowadays , the only fawnlike thing about a press agent is his gloves . Press agents are so busy these days , an unaffiliated writer like ourself ca n't even crash their offices . I 'Ve called up an agent the other day to inquire about a little matter that seemed to concern us both , and were told by his secretary that he had appointments every half-hour all afternoon and could n't work us in . We solved this dilemma by wandering over to the place and asking for the president of the company , who was as idle as a summer breeze and apparendy delighted to see us ( or anybody else ) . When we mentioned to him that his publicity man seemed rushed , he said yes rather wistfully  --  as though he wished he , too , were engaged in glamorous living . THIS issue ( February 29th ) is the first issue of that date in The New Yorker 's existence , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreariest thought we 've had all day . See you in 1964 , patriots ! WE 'VE been reading a little account of a New York lady who has a wonderful tablecloth . It is covered with names , like a post-office blotter . The names have been written on by her friends , and then embroidered ( by day labor ) . The idea is one which restaurant proprietors should consider carefully . Many diners out are prodigious tablecloth artists , of one sort or another ; one friend of ours in particular has never been known to get through a meal without leaving , pencilled on the cloth , a jaundiced fragment of his immediate despair or prejudice . Properly embroidered and laundered , the tablecloths of the town should make a fine graphic history , and patrons could enjoy , over a dish of shirred eggs , the conceits , schemes , loves , additions and subtractions , and hewilderments of previous diners and civilizations .

ALFRED E. SMITH , the famous trustee , writes us in re the Postal Telegraph Company , which has defaulted on the interest on its bonds , of which we are the unhappy owner of one . He encloses an identification card which gives us the privilege of sending messages collect via Postal , and he urges us to do so freely . Well , it 's an idea , at that . Maybe the way to revive Postal is for us bondholders to send millions of collect telegrams to all the Western Union bondholders . We can hardly wait for Mother 's Day .

Futility SEVERAL nights ago we were in a tiny bar-and-grill on the East Side when a shabby , timid little man came in , carrying under his arm a parcel wrapped in newspaper . He approached our table and said , " Pardon me . If you tie me up , I 'll get loose in three minutes . " We just looked surprised ; he opened his parcel and displayed a rope . We said gently that we were n't interested in seeing him get loose in three minutes , so he thanked us and moved on to the next table . It turned out that nobody in the place wanted to see him get loose in three minutes , so he wrapped his parcel again and went out into the night . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who he is , " the bartender told us . " He comes in about once a week , but nobody has ever tied him up yet . " Big Buzziness WHEN the Aquarium acquired an African mudspringer this winter , Mr. Christopher Coates , the curator of tropical fish , found himself in sort of a spot . Seems that the mud-springer , an unpleasant , popeyed fish which spends most of its time out of water , eats nothing but live flies  --  jumps up in the air , like a frog , and catches them . The difficult ) , of finding live flies in the kind of weather we 've been having lately was driving Mr. Coates mad until a friend of his told him about the Entomological Testing Laboratories , on Thirty-second Street . Mr. Coates might have known that in this wonderful city nobody need lack for anything , even live flies out of season . He went around to the Laboratories , and had no trouble in arranging for the mudspringer 's daily ration . There are always fifty thousand houseflies abuzz there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dr. Alfred Weed , a young entomologist from the University of Wisconsin . Not to mystify you any longer , the Laboratories are supported by a Mr. Powell , a manufacturer of insecticides , and the flies are used to test the product of Mr. Powell and a number of other fly-spray makers . Like figure-skating or trap-shooting , these tests are conducted according to a rigid code . Fly experts all over the country abide by the results and discuss them at their annual conventions , gay little affairs held in Staders here and there . Because it seemed to be the sort of thing that one should he able to talk about intelligently , we learned how the tests are run . One hundred flies are placed in a six-foot cubical box . Then a marksman with a spray gun cuts loose at them through a screened window in the box , spraying away for ten minutes . When Dr. Weed clicks his stopwatch at the end of the ten minutes , ninety-five of the hundred flies should be flat on their hacks . Then , if sixty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of insecticide is considered adequate . Dr. Weed conducts seventeen of these tests every day . The reason it has to be done so often is that pyrethrum , the active drug in most sprays , varies a good deal in strength . It 's an extract of dried flowers , imported from Japan , Dalmatia , and Kenya Colony , and some shipments are weaker than others . The martyred flies are all five days old , and all raised in a temperature of eighty-five degrees ; otherwise the relative scores of the sprays would be meaningless . Flies raised in a seventy-degree temperature , for instance , would he stronger and tougher than hothouse flies . The five-day-old flies arc in the prime of young manhood , or young womanhood , and react more consistently than adolescent or senescent flies . Dr. Weed works in a penthouse on top of an office building , with four assistants . They have n't had any adventures or crises to speak of , except for the time when they were on the eleventh floor of the building , and a big cage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with spray guns and hunt them down , all over the place . If the Entomological Testing Laboratories let their fifty thousand flies multiply for five months without killing any of them , they would have exactly 191,0 10 , - 000,000,000,000,000 . That would be enough flies to cover the earth to a depth of forty-seven feet . Dr. Weed says he does n't intend to let that happen . Prophet AS you probably know , the tracks of the shuttle trains come into Times Square on a curve , so guards have to stand near the car doors , warning passengers about the space between the cars and the platform . Most of the guards are just peevish , or sad , about this duty , but this week we have been told of a thoughtful one . " Watch ya step , watch ye step , " he was intoning . " Watch ye step , watch ye step , they have eyes but they see not , watch ye step . . . " Nyabongo 's House WE have lately heard an incredible little tale involving a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This Mr. Hare , who is only twenty-seven , has offices in Forty-fourth Street , lives in the Eighties with his wife and child , and in the summer goes to Martha 's Vineyard  --  altogether , you see , a normal , prosaic New York life . Well , a little while ago he found in his morning mail a commission from a prince of Uganda , Central Africa , to build a brick palace a hundred feet wide and two hundred feet long , with colonnades and a verandah all around it , in the Mountains of the Moon . The letter was signed " Akiki K. Nyabongo , " which gave Mr. Hare a clue to the mystery . His younger brother , who was of the class of ' 33 at Yale , had known a Prince Nyabongo , who had waited on table at the Zeta Psi house . Mr. Hare had met Nvabongo when the prince had a summer job on one of the New Bedford-Martha 's Vineyard boats . The government of Uganda , it seems , had wanted to send the Prince to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way Nyabongo could get to Yale , which for some reason he had set his heart on , was to work his way through . He had written a hook , " The Story of an African Chief , " which sold well , and had eventually departed to do graduate work at Oxford . This had presumably resulted in the restoration of his allowance , and here he was wanting a palace . Mr. Hare thinks he 'll build the palace . He is , of course , flattered by the royal commission , but wishes that the Prince had thought of something more " functionar than a brick palace , something more suited to life in Africa than a brick Parthenon . He lied just completed an egg-shaped movie theatre in Marquette , Michigan , with the screen at the small end of the egg . " Now , that , " he says proudly , " is what I call functional . " Nyabongo included in his letter a rough sketch of what he want- ed . None of the rooms is to be less than forty feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lavish . The night nursery is to be twenty by forty feet . Mr. Hare has been spending his spare time reading up on Nyabongo 's country , to see what sort of life the house has to be fitted for . There are torrential rains and earthquakes , and the major chiefs have as many as three hundred wives . Maybe the night nursery is all right for size . Mr. Hare and Nyahongo , who is still at Oxford , arc discussing the thing by mail . When the deal is settled , they will meet in Marseilles , and proceed to the Mountains of the Moon . Meanwhile , Mr. Hare is pondering a little item he found in one of his books , about currency in Uganda . Payment , it seems , is principally in humped cattle . Phonetic INan Italian restaurant the other night a patron ordered a package of cigarettes . The waiter who brought them added a notation to his check : " 1 Cestafecl-20c . " Lost Dogs IF you lose your dog , the person to see is Daisy Miller , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If she recovers him , she will get you to join the A.P.U. and provide him with a special tag hearing his address and phone number . Dogs belonging to Admiral Byrd , President Roosevelt , Buddy Rogers , Eva Le Gallienne , and the first Mrs. James J. Walker wear one of these tags . Of course , you must he prepared to face the fact that your dog may not he recovered . Stealing dogs and handling them afterward is a highly organized racket , made profitable by the heavy metropolitan demand for year-old , housebroken dogs . Sometimes , though , thieves are forced to sell pedigreed dogs for only a dollar or so : The thief gets five dollars for each dog he steals . He receives this when he delivers him to a receiving station operating as a " variety kennel . " Here the clog is spruced up and given a pedigree , either faked or belonging to some deceased blueblood . He is then usually sent to another variety kennel some distance away , probably in another state , and from there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear . Mrs. Miller suspects all pet shops , everywhere  --  except tropical-fish dealers . " They 're fine people , " she says , positively . Frequently , using an alias , she takes the trail of a stolen dog herself . In one of her cases , she traced a dog from Westchester , where it had been stolen , to a receiving station on the south shore of Long Island , thence to a breeder 's place in the middle of the Island , and thence to a first-class pet shop in Manhattan . A typical case . Mrs. Miller is small , gray , middle-aged , and tremendously energetic . She was once a Negro-dialect artist on the radio and later a program director for WABC . While on the latter job , she filled in one day with a dog talk . This aroused so much interest it was made a regular feature , and until recently she broadcast descriptions of the lost dogs of seven states . She has n't kept a record of how many lost dogs she has recovered . She estimates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lost Scotties reported to her . They 're easier to identify and trace . She seems to know almost everything there is to know about dogs . Ordinarily it takes three or four years ' study for a person to become an expert on just one breed . Mrs. Miller is an all-breed expert . She thinks it 's hereditary . Her ancestors were dog experts from the thirteenth century on . She knows dog history and legends , and will tell you about the dog that was formally tried for a crime in England in 1733 . Mrs. Miller and the A.P.U. are out to reduce dog tax-es . Outside the city , the rate is $2.50 for males and $5.25 for females . In some other states , taxes run as high as $10.50 . The taxes are supposed to be devoted to providing animal shelters , but Albany collects much more than is necessary for this purpose . In 1930 , the excess was $800,000 . Mrs. Miller also seeks other xeforms . In a certain New York county , for instance , one of four dog-catchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not counting rewards for returning dogs to owners . Dog-catchers are paid two dollars for every dog they catch and two dollars more for every one destroyed . Mrs. Miller wants them put on a different basis . Another thing she wants is less dilatoriness from the state officials in handling licence records . If , in the early part of the year , you find a lost dog and try to identify him by the licence tag , you have to wait until September to get the information from Albany . It takes them eight months every year to get the records centralized . News from Home WEknow of a nice little family which broke up amiably a couple of years ago , the lady keeping charge of her small daughter and remarrying , the gentleman returning to his pipe and his books . He takes his daughter to luncheon and a matinee every now and then , and it was while they were returning from one of these excursions , on a Fifth Avenue bus , that she said , loudly and clearly , " By the way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby ? " Six Figures WHEN somebody turns to you at dinner and asks you how much Mrs. Roosevelt has made out of her radio broadcasts , you can say $119,000 . Of course , she does n't take a cent of it herself ; has never even seen a cent of it . Her share ( three-quarters ) she allotted at the beginning to the American Friends Service Committee . It has been used for health centres , schools , and welfare work generally . The other quarter goes to a tall , heavy , groaning gentleman named Myles F. Lasker , who acts as her radio agent . Mr. Lasker groans because of what he could do with the First Lady if he had a free hand . He has n't , by any means . Mrs. Roosevelt has to approve first of whatever company wants to sponsor her , and even when she does , it 's no go if the President says no . Recently , we hear , he said no on an offer which would have brought in $8,500 a broadcast for thirteen weeks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . We do n't know what the objections have been . As you may know , Mrs. Roosevelt has so far broadcast for Pond 's beauty creams and lotions , Simmons ' beds , the Typewriter Research Educational Institute ( if you know what it is , do n't from Washington . He convinced her he was fair , reminding her that he was always at the studio , and stressing his protective capacity . She was satisfied . He has nothing to do with writing her talks  --  she writes every word herself , but she is always nice about listening to suggestions from anybody . Mr. Lasker . has offices ( one room ) at 2 West Forty-fifth Street . He has acted as radio agent for , among others , Admiral Byrd and Amelia Earhart Putnam . The First Lady is . not his only client now , but he would n't name any others , contenting himself with the general comment that he was " in public relations . " On a wall of his office is a photograph of Mrs. Roosevelt , on which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a framed parchment conferring on Mr. Lasker an honorary degree of Doctor of Humanities . It was bestowed two years ago by Maryland College for Women , at Luthcrville , Md. , " in recognition , " says Mr. Lasker , " of what I have done for Mrs. Roosevelt . " The degree entitles Mr. Lasker to the rights , privileges , and immunities of Maryland College for Women . It gives him a sense of sanctuary . Mrs. Roosevelt calls him Colonel Lasker . He is , in fact , an adjutant general of Kentucky  --  Governor Laffoon appointed him to his staff several years ago . write us about it ) , and the Selby Shoe Company . She got $4,000 a broadcast from all of these except Pond 's , which paid her $2,400 . The money is all paid to Mr. Lasker , who deducts his share and sends the rest to the A.F.S.C. We figure he 's made around $30,000 for his work . He says , " I serve in a protective capacity . " He 's at the studio every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no pistol permit ; his protective capacity is of a purely commercial and social nature . Mr. Lasker met Mrs. Roosevelt through his friend , Louis M. Howe , the President 's secretary . She spurned radio at first , but was won over by the charity idea . Her first talk ( for Pond 's ) was just a few days before the inauguration . She 's talked commercially thirty-four times since then , fifteen minutes each time . She signs a separate contract with Mr. Lasker before each series of broadcasts . She never deals with the companies themselves ; they have to go to him . If they contact her first , she tells them that . Once an advertising agency told her that Mr. Lasker 's commission was much too high . She phoned him right away about this , Practical 1- the night of our last snowstorm a young wom- an stood on a certain bleak street corner in Brooklyn , waiting , banally enough , for a streetcar .

He kept after her , pointing out that the streetcars did n't seem to be running , and that she could n't just stay there . She remained obstinate , and finally he lost his patience . " Lady , " he said sharply , opening the door of his car , " get in . This ai n't no time to be virtuous . "
