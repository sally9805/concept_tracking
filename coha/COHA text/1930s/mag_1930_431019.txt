 | THERE is a certain bank president , a graduate of the class of 1899 , who never misses a reunion . Last June he came back from his college to his office in a somber frame of mind . At the class dinner , which had been attended by seventy-five men , the toastmaster had conceived the bright idea of calling on the three most successful members of the class to make informal talks about their own activities . " It 's the kind of thing I hate , but we were given no warning , " said the banker . " There was nothing to do but stand up and be as , brief as possible . I told a couple of stories about the bank , added a few words on general business conditions , and sat down . The other two men did the same thing , and we thought no more about it . " But two days later , when I reached my office and looked at my mail , there on the top of the heap were letters from five classmates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he tossed across the desk was written on hotel stationery and mailed from the college town , the writer evidently having lost no time in taking his pen in hand . The letter read as follows : " DEAR BILL : It was good to see you at the dinner . It seems to me you have changed less in thirty years than almost any of us . Perhaps there is something in being successful which keeps a man young . You have had some fortunate breaks , as you said in your little talk , but you have deserved them . I have never forgotten what a worker you were when you roomed across the corridor from me in sophomore year . Do you remember how you used to sneak out into the country in the evenings and take orders from the farmers ' wives for aluminum cooking utensils ? Fleecing the poor peasantry ' we called it , but you never overlooked a bet even then . " Well , Bill , the object of this letter is not to rehearse old times , but to ask you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has n't been so lucky . I want a job . I want to get out of Smithville where I have been buried ever since we graduated . I have a wonderful wife and three healthy kids , and I would n't trade a single hour of our happiness for a million dollars . But the fact is that Ellen and I would have been wiser if we had postponed our marriage until I was further along . We 've had a living out of the lumber business , but only a living . And Heaven only knows how I hate it ! " Before I get to be an old man , Bill , I want a real chance . I want to get into a bank , which is where I ought to have started thirty years ago . I want to break through the narrow boundaries of Smithville into a man's-size town . I 'm fiftytwo this summer , but I 'm younger in mind and spirit than I was on our graduation day . Ca n't you dig up something for me in your bank ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to New York standards . I know that I can prove to you that I 've got something on the ball . " " No need to read the other four , " the banker said . " They are all alike . If I could do anything for one of those men , I 'd do it in a minute . But what can I do ? Each of them had the same chance that I did to choose work that would give him satisfaction . Now , after thirty years , they wake up to discover that their choice was wrong . They were picked men , endowed by society with an extra four years of education . Their parents sacrificed to make their education possible . Yet the only result is five unhappy lives . "  | He went on to say how hard it is to analyze the causes of success and failure . He told in some detail the stories of two men who seemed to have very much the same characteristics and opportunities , yet have come out at opposite ends of the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they will not be recognized , and calling the men John Smith and William Brown . The father of John Smith was a lawyer in the Middle West , who had achieved admission to the bar by the old-fashioned method of reading law in a country law office . His earnings were never more than three or four thousand dollars a year , but he had a comfortable home , was a deacon in the church , and an influential member of the community . Twice he had been elected to the state legislature , and when he died he was county judge . John was the only son . He was a popular member of his college class and might easily have stood at the top , but the spur of necessity was lacking . His path stretched out too straight and smooth . His lawschool expenses would be paid by his father ; then he would establish a practice somewhere , and one day , he , too , would become a judge . He liked the law . He liked the idea of having people address him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . Meanwhile , being young and an undergraduate , he would enjoy himself . At the senior prom he met the Only Girl in the World , and they were married in July . John 's father complained a little at the burden of having to support them both , but they assured him that two could live as cheaply as one , and , it must be recorded in fairness , they did their best to prove it . They lived in one room near the law school . She did the cooking and washing and mended his socks , and everything might have been different except for that Great Accident which is ever inevitable but never foreseen . In January the Judge died . John 's mother urged him to borrow enough from her insurance money to finish his course , but he felt it would be unfair . A few days after the funeral he sold his law books , moved to a near-by town , and went to work in the business department of the daily newspaper . From that point on his life has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been against him , and in a sense he can make out a very good case for himself . He has been faithful to most of the copy-book rules for success . He has espoused all of the negative virtues ; that is to say , he has not gambled or loafed or used liquor , or been unfaithful to his family . He has worked hard . Indeed , it might almost be said that he has worked too hard ; that his attempt to do too many things has been partly responsible for his failure . While he was working on the newspaper he saw a chance to increase his income by selling real estate on the side . He was getting on fairly well in both capacities when he became acquainted with the general manager of the local electric light company , who hired him to take charge of its sales of electrical merchandise . He tackled the job ambitiously and , still eager to improve his financial position , played the violin in the orchestra of the local theatre at night . After a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the big chances are in the cities , and that if he could get to Chicago and connect himself with the automobile industry , which was young and growing , his fortune would be secure . He made the move and became a salesman for one of the first of the motor companies . His earnings were good , but his expenses were greater . His wife , who had enjoyed her friendships in the smaller city , felt lonesome and unhappy . The children missed their big back yard and were frequently sick . Moreover John began to doubt the future of the automobile . He had seen the bicycle become a sudden craze and then pass out ; the motor car , he argued , would probably do likewise . He thought it safer to be connected with " something that people have to have , " and so he went on the road to sell linoleum . Still true to his habit of trying to eke out with a side-line , he carried samples of bathroom fixtures and picked up an occasional order in the evenings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the law . If a big case were being tried anywhere in his territory , and he could possibly arrange his route so as to take it in , he would be found in the front row in the court room . He carried law books with him and read them in his hotel bedroom at night . The more difficult the problems of his daily life became , the more pathetically he clung to the dream of his youth . He firmly believed that if his father had lived , @#  | he would have become a highly successful member of the bar . But , having been thwarted in his first enthusiasm , he has been unable in thirty years to find another interest strong enough to endure . THE early years of William Brown were spent on a farm . He , too , had the urge to become a lawyer , but he was not so fortunate ? or shall we say unfortunate ? as John Smith in being able to rely on parental support . William took his high school diploma , thirty dollars in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the state capital , where he went to work in a drug store and enrolled for a course in stenography at night . In less than a year he could take shorthand rapidly and thereupon abandon the drug store to become private secretary to a leading lawyer . After two years in this capacity he felt wealthy enough to enter the state university . He had become proficient at shorthand and was able to get considerable sparetime work in and about the courts . This paid well and gave him a background which has subsequently been valuable . The state university was co-educational , and in his sophomore year William also met the Only Girl and was married . Before he graduated from the university his oldest son was born . To most men the support of a wife and child , with two years of college and three years of law school ahead , would have seemed a discouraging burden , but William had already taken the measure of the world and defied its power to hurt him . Besides , his wife was not an expense . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she solicited magazine subscriptions , and with her contributions and what William collected from the courts and lawyers , they not only lived well , but actually regarded their fellow students with a benevolent pity . What a shame to waste so many good years ! In this confident mood they came East to tackle the law school . It never occurred to either of them that they were hard up , or that they were taking too long a chance on the future . They had health and each other and his love for the law . Surely these would be enough to carry them through . So it proved . Upon his graduation William made straight for New York , as being the place where there was most law business to be done , and on his arrival he did a truly courageous thing . He took the typewriter which had carried him through the years and sold it to a second-hand dealer for twenty-five dollars . " I knew that if I went into a big law office and they discovered that I was an expert stenographer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into stenographic work , " he explained . " Some big confidential case would come along , and the partners would say : We do n't want to entrust this to a stenographer . Here , Bill , you help us out . ' I wanted to be known as a promising young lawyer , not as an expert stenographer , and so I junked the faithful old typewriter that had served me so well , and I have never owned one since . " The years that followed were not made any easier by the birth of three other children . But Bill today is a partner in an important law firm and financially able to retire . He never will . - " He loves the law , " Mary says . " Give him a hard case to bite into , and he is happy as a puppy wrestling with a bone . He 's never cared about money , though somehow the money has seemed to take care of itself . But he certainly does get a lot of fun out of his work . " IN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that both John and William came from the same good American stock , both had excellent mental equipment , and should , apparently , have achieved equal success . What , then , was the cause of John 's failure ? He himself attributes it to his too early marriage . If he had been single when his father died , he could have borrowed the money and completed his law course ; but , having a wife dependent upon him , he did not feel justified in taking the chance . Yet William took an even longer chance and won . Whether a man marries at twenty-one or thirty-one is not usually the determining factor in his success . If he marries the right girl , they will somehow pull through , provided he is happy in his work . John 's mistake was in abandoning the work that he loved for work which meant nothing to him except the means of living . Having committed this fundamental mistake , he aggravated it , as the banker pointed out , by continuing to indulge his secret longing for the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned down by one sister , and marries another , but lets his heart still stray after the first . What such a man should do is to put the first girl resolutely out of his mind and make it a business to discover every possible beauty in the girl who has become his wife . Just look at John 's record , " the banker continued . " He was well started in the business department of a newspaper in a fast-growing little city . I happen to know that a man who took that job after John gave it up is now general manager of the newspaper and independent . John looked on his work there as merely so many dollars a week . He thought he could increase the number of those dollars by selling suburban property on the side , and for a time he did increase his earnings quite a little .

He passed on to the automobile business , and there his experience was the same . Newspaper work , real estate , public utilities , the automobile ? any one of these would have made him independent if only he had said : " This is my work , and I am going to make myself love it . I am going to think all the time how interesting it is , how important , how much it means in the lives of the people it serves .

" The Editor sent me that letter with a memorandum saying that there are Job-Hunting  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! There certainly are . I shall never forget the weeks that followed my graduation away back in 1907 . Business was already beginning to foreshadow the panic that was to come that fall . We graduates found no Captains of Industry waiting to bid against each other for our services . One of our prize athletes , after knocking on doors until his knuckles were raw , finally took a job collecting over-due furniture bills . Ultimately he was able to transfer into the business that he liked , and has become successful , but for the first few months it was a case of beggars can not be choosers . Having been around a printing press more or less ever since I was fifteen years old , I knew that I wanted to be on a newspaper , but the newspapers were surfeited with bright young men fired with the same ambition . One hot day in July , when I had finished a futile round of calls in Boston and was about to take a train out to my father 's summer home . I ran across a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an appointment . We chatted for a moment , and when I left him my soul was filled with envy . We did not meet again until our tenth reunion , and then I asked him if he remembered our chance encounter on that hot sidewalk . " I surely do , " he answered . " Do you know what I thought ? " I asked him . " I thought : Here 's Jones who has found something to do . He 's busy . He 's on his way . He hardly has a minute for a loafer like me . And here I am , wanting to work and ca n't find it anywhere ! ' How I envied you ! " And do you want to know what I thought ? " he answered with a laugh . " I thought : It 's pretty soft for Barton , going back to his father 's nice , cool house in the country , while I have to chase through these hot streets in search of orders . ' If you envied me , believe me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the envy in life is of that character . The man whose position looks so fortunate to you , with whom you contrast your own life unfavorably , is often looking jealously in your direction , wondering why you seem to get all the breaks ! July and August wore away , and finally I was able to persuade a contractor to let me work on a new railroad in Montana . While I was out there , the panic broke in earnest . The business depression of 1930 has been serious enough , but , for the encouragement of the college graduates of this year , let me say that the class of 1907 walked into a panic that was a panic . Money was not merely hard to get ; it was impossible . Even strong companies , with thousands in the bank , could not draw out a cent . One of my vivid Montana memories is of the night when we had paid off our Montenegrin day laborers with checks which neither the stores nor the saloons could cash . The Montenegrins , to whom the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonfire in front of our little wooden office and threatened an organized attack . Inside we sat all night with loaded shotguns across our knees . REMEMBER , too , the streets of Chicago when , after six months in Montana , I went to that city , having succeeded in connecting with a publishing house . The men in the soup lines ! The men who stopped me every night and morning on the way between the station and the office , asking for a few pennies ! The hordes of men who walked the streets all day with picks and shovels across their backs , looking for any work at all ! These were the pictures burned into the memories of those who graduated that year of 1907 . It made us realize how blessed a thing it is to have a job . It inspired us with a humble and wholesome fear . A fear of slighting our work , lest we should lose it . A fear of the sort of speculation which might leave us penniless in later life . A certain sense of noblesse oblige @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To the class of 1930 I would say that there are certain real advantages in graduating Ina year when business is none too good . It is an asset to have some of your disappointments come at the beginning . Those who start under the discipline of hard knocks are likely to gain a capacity for endurance which will stand them in good stead later on . If this fall is discourae ing , count it as a valuable post-graduate experience . We of 1907 went through that experience . We were tough , and we survived . So will you . One good thing about a period when jobs are hard to get is that you may have to try two or three before you can connect with the thing you really want . Perhaps you will be restive under this necessity . I was . I kept thinking : " My parents have sent me through college . I have been an expense to them for more than twenty years . I must begin to earn some money . I must take myself off their backs . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt for getting under way immediately was more imaginary than real . My parents , having stood behind me so long , were perfectly willing to finance me a little longer . And what I could earn in a year at that time , though it seemed so important , is a trifle compared to my earning power now . The vital thing was not to take the first thing which came along , but to be sure that what I chose was in line with my talent and interest . The weeks in Montana were useful ; they showed me something of a kind of life which I never should have known otherwise . If I had been compelled to follow them by some weeks in a grocery store or a tannery , that experience also , coming at that time , would have been an addition to my education . For the net result , I am sure , would have been to make me only more determined to get connected somehow with the printing press . " But your problem was comparatively simple , " some one exclaims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for writing and publishing . All I know is that I want to be n business . How can I determine what is the right business for me ? " Without being wise enough to answer that question adequately , let me set down half a dozen suggestions : r . It seems to me that the dominant characteristics of most human beings are observable , in some degree , almost from babyhood . Solomon , who is given credit for many wise observations , is reported to have said , " Train up a child in the way he should go , and when he is old he will not depart from it . " From that text have been preached many sermons on the importance of religious training in the home . But I am told that a majority of scholars now give the verse a somewhat different translation . What Solomon really said was , " Train up a child according to his natural bent , and when he is old he will not depart from it . " In other words , study your child , see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for work in line with that interest . If you , Mr. or Miss 1930 , will analyze your own childhood and school years you will discover some trait , some interest , some enthusiasm that is valuable as a clue . Perhaps you were the youngster to whom the others came with their bruised fingers and stubbed toes . Perhaps you were the boy who set up the lemonade stand in the back yard . Perhaps you carried a newspaper route . Perhaps you loved mathematics and hated English composition . Perhaps you used to slip back into the chemical laboratory in the afternoons and have fun putting all sorts of strange mixtures together . Perhaps your only real interest was in athletics . Or maybe you just endured the rest of your college courses for the joy of the botany or geology trips , away from the class-room out into the fresh green country . If there is any such clue in your background , however faint ,  | do not neglect it . It may be a pointer toward the sort of work that will hold your interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years from now . 2 . While no one can look very far ahead , it is important to try to forecast the probable future of the business which you are considering . When I graduated from college the street railways were a rapidly expanding industry , and the automobile was still hardly more than a rich man 's toy . Yet it required no very great imagination even in those days to foresee that if a man were interested in transportation he could probably make more progress in the automobile business than in the street car business . The street car was Goliath , and the automobile was David , but David was going to win . Similarly , at any period , certain businesses are expanding , while others are either standing still or have reached the period of diminishing returns . In so far as possible , choose an enterprise which is going to grow . 3 . In this connection I have often been tempted to write an article on what might be called " neglected businesses . " College graduates , like sheep , tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation which seem to be the vogue . A hundred years ago a majority of graduates entered the ministry . Later , teaching and the law were the favorites . When I was in high school every second lad in the class was going to be a mechanical or an electrical engineer . More recently , banking and , if the number of youngsters who come to my office is any criterion , advertising , have had a special lure . Hardly any college graduate announces that he is going to become a salesman of insurance . Yet I remember attending the annual convention of a big insurance company and walking through the crowd with the president while he pointed out one man after another and told me what each one earned . The incomes were astonishingly high , and the president said , " If any man of good selling ability will work hard with us for ten years , his earnings will compare favorably with the best in any other business or profession . " Few college graduates look for work in retail stores . Yet the biggest problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best opportunities lie ahead of the men who have learned retailing at first hand . ALL of which is intended to suggest that the wise boy or girl will not blindly follow the crowd . If a majority of your class is headed for Wall Street or the law school , or in any other direction , do n't be carried along with them . Look first into your own mind for a possible clue to your talent and interest ; then look around and see whether there may not be some neglected business , all the more attractive because so many have passed it by . 4 . In the previous article it was said that more mistakes are made by young people starting too high than are made by starting too low . It is worth re-emphasizing . Indeed , of two jobs offered to a new graduate , the one which involves the least money and the most drudgery is usually the one to take , provided it is in a sound and growing industry . The man-traps of business are the nice white-collar jobs that offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality , and an ability to make acquaintances and wear goodlooking clothes . These jobs lead nowhere . The future presidents of industry will start this fall in the shops , among the section gangs , in the stock-rooms . When , later on , they are brought into the offices , they will have an experience and a basis for judgment which those who have never been outside the office do not possess and can not acquire . 5 . I believe that every graduate ought to face frankly the question : Am I the sort of person who will be happier in the city or the country ? For more than a century the tide of  | American life has been flowing steadily toward the cities . The big fortunes have been made there . The lure is great . Remember , however , that if you start in a small town and outgrow it , you can always move to a big town . But the big towns are full of lonesome and unhappy folk who might have been useful and important members of smaller communities . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your classmates are doing it . If the incomes in the smaller community are somewhat less , the pressure , also , is less , and the friendships are more . You live only once . Pick out a place to live , if you can , where you will be happy . 6 . Dr. Theodore L. Cuyler , who had excellent opportunity to observe the careers of thousands of men in New York , was asked to name the most important element in success . " Staying power , " he answered without hesitation . This is important to remember after you have completed your self-analysis and made your choice of work . No matter how wisely you have chosen , the work will not be so exciting or romantic as it looked from the outside . There will be dreariness and disappointments . You should expect them and discount them from the start . A BOY who knew that he wanted to work in a store was met by repeated rebuffs , but finally was given a job on condition that he work for nothing . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard labor on a farm , and he lived on this until it was gone , paying $b3.50 a week for board and room . At the end of two and a half years his salary was only six dollars a week . When it jumped to the splendid height of ten dollars , he . felt so rich that he married . A few weeks later , after a bitter and unjust interview , his cold-hearted employer cut him to eight dollars . " It was a terrible blow , " he said in after years . " I became terribly depressed . I wrote a pitiful letter to my mother . She sent me in reply the loveliest letter any one ever penned . She finished up many encouraging assurances with this sentence , " Some day , my son , you will be a rich man . ' " Although I felt sure she did n't believe it any more than I did , somehow the expression of her faith in me buoyed me up . I kept up the depressing struggle until I was near death 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the boy had an idea . He would open a store in which every article should sell for five cents . He opened five stores in succession . Three out of the five were failures . But he stuck ! His I name was Woolworth . A boy graduated from college with the ambition to be a writer . He had contributed to the college papers and had some talent also as an artist . In the first five years after graduation he never had one single manuscript accepted . His total earnings for the period were twenty-five dollars , which he received for a drawing . His name is Tarkington . A man worked for twenty-five years on a single book and then , though his researches were far from completed , he decided to publish what he had written , fearing that he might die and leave no record of his studies . The man 's name was Charles Darwin . Read some day the introduction to his book , " On the Origin of Species , " a stimulating example of the results of dogged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instances . It is staying power that wins . S. S. McClure , the publisher , once remarked that " a magazine is the most jealous mistress in the world . " He meant that if an editor loses his interest for even a few hours , the magazine , like a slighted woman , will pout and be less sparkling . Editing is not an eight-hour job ; it is a twenty-four-hour job . Everything an editor reads , everything he sees or hears , automatically presents itself to his analytical sense is a possible article or story . Only by loving the job continuously can he do his best . The same thing is true of any sort of work . @#  | An amusing compliment was once paid me by a friend , who said , " If you woke some morning to find you had inherited a circus , you would think of three new ways to sell pink lemonade before you were out of the shower bath . " His observation was unduly generous , but I do think that if I had happened into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garage business , I could , with a little affectionate effort , have developed an enthusiasm for it . It would not have been my natural bent , but it would have opened opportunities of interest and profit . And I am equally sure that there would have been times when I should have grown very sick of the shoe business or the circus business , just , as there are many hours when I wish I might never see a typewriter again . DO not know any better way to conclude this informal discussion than by quoting the advice which was given to a friend of mine by his prospective father-in-law . The old man was notoriously sparing of words and during the courtship of his daughter had made no suggestions . His attitude was that each generation must settle its own affairs , and that if his daughter and her fiance had made their decision , that was all right with him . But the night before the wedding he invited my friend into the library and handed him a cigar . " I just want to put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years to be good years , " he said . " We old fellows were raised in a tough school . Hard fighting and slendet profits and frequent set-backs were our regular rations . I was busted twice before I wa : thirty-five , and never saved any real money until I was almost fifty . Since the World Wat things have been different , for business has expanded so fast , providing so many opportunities , that thousands of young men have jumped into success without experiencing any real struggle . Do n't be misled by this into expecting too much . You will have some yearE when you will be a lot further ahead , and there will be others when , with just as much planning and hard work , you will come to the end and discover that you have n't laid up a cent . It is the average that counts , and that is made up by taking the good with the bad , the bitter with the sweet . " I commend that bit of wisdom to my young readers , and I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost every honest , hard-working life can and should show definite progress . Business is nothing more or less than the machinery which has been set up for feeding and clothing and transporting and otherwise ministering to the human race . Every year the number of people to be served increases , and the range of their needs expands . Automatically this means more business to be transacted , more profitable work to be done . Now and again the productive facilities run ahead of themselves and have to be slowed down for a few months until consumption catches up . Sometimes the imperfect operations of international finance and exchange result in maladjustment ? an inexcusable surplus at one point and tragic want at another . But every year economists are discovering more about the laws that govern business . Little by little the peaks and valleys arc being smoothed out , and the operations are becoming more generally profitable for all who deserve to succeed . So , on behalf of those who have been on the job for quite a while and are still happy in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the class of rg3o . Come in , my friends , and join the race . Do n't start too fast , do n't worry , do n't overstrain . It is not a sprint , but a marathon . Those who lead for the first hundred yards need not excite your envy nor depress your spirits ; the prizes are awarded later on .
