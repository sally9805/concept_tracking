txt Headed by the Chief Justice of the United States , a majority of five members of the Supreme Court today overrode their four colleagues in the cases growing out of the repeal of the gold-payment clause in public and private contracts by the Seventy-third Congress , involving more than 100 billions , and held in effect that government and private creditors must accept , in depreciated currency , dollar for dollar on interest and principal sums named in the contracts . The majority and the minority agreed only on one point  --  that the gold-clause repeal in government contracts was unconstitutional . But the majority offered no redress to the litigating contract-holders , on the ground that no damage had been shown , while the four dissenters insisted that the damage was demonstrable as the precise difference of 69 cents in the value of the " old dollar " containing 26.8 grains of gold nine-tenths fine and the " new " dollar containing 15 5-21 grains . Ca n't Sue for Nominal Damage . Since there is no practical effect of the majority 's one agreement with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all respects . Bondholders may not sue for ' nominal damages in the Court of Claims . Some lawyers hold , however , that if , at some future time , the dollar is revalued to a point where it can be shown in the Court of Claims that it will purchase less than the dollar did when a citizen bought a government security , containing the gold clause , he can recover the proved difference under the majority opinion . Noting That this inference may cast a shadow over future stabilization conferences , an administration spokesman said tonight that it may be advisable for Congress to pass a statute specifically prohibiting suits on this ground in the Court of Claims . The first conclusion of a ' White House conference earlier in the day , however , had been that no protective legislation would be brought forward immediately . More study may speedily alter that conclusion . Justice Stone Protests . It was this loophole left by the majority opinion against which Mr. Justice Stone protested in a supplemental writing , which he read in court today . Deploring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in government obligations , he fully agreed that the government bondholder , John M. Perry , who sued , had no present standing in the Court of Claims . But he said the statement that the government 's gold clause obligation was greater than that of a private individual may operate to " interpose serious obstacles to the adoption of measures to stabilize the dollar " at any gold point desired by Congress . He summed up as follows : I ? * * do not join in so much of the opinion as may be taken to suggest that the exercise of the sovereign power to borrow money on credit , which does not override the sovereign immunity from suit , may nevertheless preclude or impede the exercise of another sovereign power , to regulate the value of money ; or to suggest that , although there ? is and can be no present cause of action upon the repudiated gold clause , its obligation is nevertheless , in some manner and to some extent , not stated , superior to the i power to regulate the currency which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds . Federal Bond Holders ' Outlook . The majority finding that the repeal of the gold clause in public obligations was unconstitutional can not be practically applied for the following reasons : The court stated firmly that Perry , the litigant in this particular cause , not only had offered no proof of damage but had actually suffered none , and thus it took the ground from beneath any similar suit , while the gold content of the dollar remains as it is and there is no free gold market . Another litigant could hardly hope to prove damages when the Supreme Court so strongly implied that , under existing conditions , Perry had taken none . So much for actions in the Court of Claims under breach of contract , pleading the declared unconstitutionality of the statute . The Court of Claims is the only tribunal wherein the government can be sued for damages or loss . Should revaluation occur , or a free gold market be established , which would open the court to suits for breach of contract and proof of damage , Congress has only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therefore the result of the declaration of unconstitutionality is nil to a holder of a gold-clause government obligation and can be kept nil by statute against any change in the economic situation . Three Support . Joining with the Chief Justice in affirming the lower court judgment that sustained government action throughout were Justices Brandeis , Roberts , Cardozo and Stone . The dissenting four , whose views were orally expounded in a remarkable address by Mr. Justice , were himself , Justices Van Deventer , Butler and Sutherland . In announcing its rulings , the nation 's highest court broke one precedent and badly shattered another . The Chief Justice read a brief summary of the findings before he began reading the text , an unprecedented action . Mr. Justice , putting aside the dissenting text , interposed for nearly half an hour heated and extemporaneous remarks in which he confessed " shame and humiliation " over the majority decision . In open court he said : " The Constitution is gone ! " The cases decided were those of citizens suing to recover the currency equivalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds , and of gold or its currency equivalent on Liberty bonds and gold certificates . Government Officials Elated . Government officials , from the President down , greeted the decision with elation . In a statement issued early in the afternoon the President expressed himself as gratified . There was a White House conference among the President , the Secretary of State , the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury , joined by the Senate Democratic leader , J. T. Robinson of Arkansas , at the end of which Senator Robinson said that no protective steps were necessary , and therefore none would be taken . From Capitol Hill the comment was generally favorable . On all sides it was asserted that the decision established the complete power of Congress over the monetary system and its power in law , if not in morals , to alter any contract , public or private , in terms of the currency . Inflationists prepared to press their campaign for further devaluation of the dollar to 50 or 40 cents , but there was no indication that any such step would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Baltimore &; Ohio Railroad and lathers , which dealt with the 75 bill lions in private contracts , the Chief Justice described the steps by which the administration met the banking crisis of 1933 when it assumed office , and progressed to a description of the erection of the . new monetary system by Congress and the President on the authority of Congress . " We are not concerned here , " he said , " with the wisdom of these steps . We are concerned with power , not with policy . " Issue in the Norman Case . The question in the Norman case was , should the bondholder receive $22.50 interest in the devalued currency , or $38.10 , the equivalent of the former gold dollar ? The court agreed with the Attorney General 's argument that the monetary acts formed a continuous chain and revealed a fixed intention by Congress to exercise its constitutional authority to regulate the value of the currency . The gold clauses in these private contracts interfered with the exercise of that power . Nothing in the Legal Tender or any previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the gold clause in the private contracts were enforceable , said the court , States , municipalities , railroads and other corporations would be in the position of receiving payment for services at the rate of 31 and meeting their obligations at the rate of $1.69 . It would require no " profound economy , " said the court , to recognize the impossibility of such an arrangement . Gold clauses , the court continued , were to be found in a large part of the outstanding obligations of these debtors . Consequences No Excuse . " We are not concerned with consequences , " read the Chief Justice , " in the sense that consequences , however serious , may excuse an invasion of constitutional rights . We are concerned with the constitutional power of the Congress over the monetary system of the country and its attempted frustration * * . In the light of abundant experience , Congress was entitled to choose such a uniform monetary system and to reject a dual system with respect to all obligations within the range of its constitutional authority . " Finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new monetary policy , Congress . said the court , had abolished them not " capriciously or arbitrarily . " T. here was " a congenital infirmity " in contracts which deal with subject matter within the control of Congress . The plaintiffs had no case . The Chief Justice then turned to the " gold certificates case , " brought by F. Eugene Nortz to receive gold coin as nominated in the bond . The court held that , despite any words of the Secretary of the Treasury , the $106,300 in gold certificates held by the plaintiff were not " warehouse receipts " for bullion , that they called for dollars and not bullion , and , as for gold coin , this had been withdrawn from circulation by the uncontested power of the government and therefore the plaintiff would not have been permitted to keep or use the coin if ne got it . The plaintiff was restrained by law from resorting to free gold markets abroad , and there was none in this country . Having suffered no damages , he was not entitled to receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing in the Court of Claims . Government 's Pledge Differs . The court then proceeded to read the opinion in the Perry case , where it found a situation different from that presented in the private contract and gold certificate suits . Perry 's bond was purchased with the government 's pledge of payment . It was written in specifically to protect the purchaser from loss from depreciated currency , and the vendor from loss if currency were appreciated meanwhile . About twelve billions in Federal contracts , said the court , were affected . Here was not a question of regulating the currency but of altering the terms of a government pledge , said the court . Congress , in doing that , had exceeded its powers . But Perry had no right to be " enriched " by his gold contract and , if he received the $6,931.25 extra he claimed on his $10,000 bond , he would be . A claimant of this sort could not sue for breach of contract unless he showed actual or real losses sustained through the repudiation of the contract . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opinion of the court , he could not do so , under prevailing economic conditions , he has no present standing in the Court of Claims . The Supreme Court declined to answer question No. 2 from that tribunal , which was whether the United States is generally obliged to respond in the Court of Claims on suits for damages growing out of gold bond contracts . " Rehearses " Opinion . After Mr. Justice Stone had stated his objection to the discussion in the Chief Justice 's opinion of question No. 2 , since he agreed it should not be answered , Mr. Justice began his remarks . He said that the written opinion of the minority was available to any who wished to read it and that it might be well to " rehearse " the reasoning in open court . " It is a plain simple tale , " he said . " It seems impossible to overestimate the result of what has been done here today . " The Constitution , he said , " is gone . " Government guarantees to its citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been pre-empted by Congress . Some day the truth will be seen . Debased currencies were not new . Nero attempted to exercise that power in ancient Rome . The justice spoke of the war days when " men stood on the street corners and said these bonds , with the solemn promise of the government back of them , were the finest in the world . " But Congress saw fit to pass laws destroying " all these contracts . It 's not a thing I like to talk about . God knows I wish I did n't have to . But there are some responsibilities attaching to a man on this bench to reveal to the bar , in all its nakedness , just what has been done . " He then orally reviewed the reasoning in the written dissent , ending with his remark about " shame and humiliation . " When he had finished there was a stir in the court , but the marshal rapped for order and the Chief Justice calmly proceeded to read another opinion in a wholly unrelated case . The sensational episode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As written , the dissenting text began with a description of the repeal of the gold clauses as " repudiation and spoliation of citizens by their sovereign , " and called the clauses a definite , enforceable contract . The minority pointed out with severity that the government as late as May 2 , 1933 , had issued obligations for $550,000,000 including the gold clause . The four Justices cited the International Court of Arbitration rulings in the Brazilian repudiation case , in which the Chief Justice ? then a member of the tribunal ? joined in upholding the validity of a gold clause . The case of Gregory vs . Morris points the way to fix Perry 's damages , said the minority . It conceded that , however much it deplored the majority 's finding , the gold cases should be settled promptly in the interest of " legitimate commerce . " The minority did not challenge the right of Congress to fix the gold content of the dollar , or to call in gold coin , bullion and certificates . But it opposed repudiation , saying that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purposes of meeting , not repudiating , obligations . The government , on the majority 's reasoning , wrote the minority , could fix a dollar with one grain of gold and give a huge profit to the Treasury , " " enough to cancel the public debt . " The Thomas Amendment destroyed " legally acquired rights , " and the gold-clause repeal violates the Fifth Amendment , in that there is no provision for compensation . The dissenters mentioned specifically that the Philippine Government and Americans in the foreign service were compensated for losses through dollar depreciation , but that domestic citizens were not . Crowd Gathers Early in Day . The court proceedings were packed with sensations . A great crowd , confident that the decision would be rendered today , gathered early , and , since the chamber is small , most of them had to remain outside . Photographers set up their lights and apparatus near the entrance . Counsel , wives of Justices and other dignitaries and a few fortunate persons with passes took their seats . The President kept in close communication with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after explaining the purpose of the decisions briefly , began reading the three majority texts . The other justices sat or lay back in their chairs , and there was no indication of the scene to come . When the Chief Justice had finished , Mr. Justice Stone read his short dissent on the majority 's argument in the Liberty bond cases , though not disagreeing with the affirmation . Then Mr. Justice , who had been leaning back with his eyes closed , sat forward and began to speak . He paid virtually no attention to his text . When early in his remarks he said : " To us Ethe minority these things are abhorrent , " it was clear that the 5-4 division which arose over the Minnesota debt moratorium and the New York milk cases had had grown into a fixed cleavage and intensified in gravity . Capital Had Developed Nerves . For more than a month the capital had been in a state of nerves over the gold decision . When the suits were first brought , little attention was paid to them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow over the government deeper than any since the banking crisis of 1933 . On two previous Saturdays , so great was the tension , the Supreme Court had authorized its clerk to announce that there would ? be no ' gold opinions on the subsequent Mondays . Last Saturday no announcement was forthcoming , which led to the confident , and correct , expectation of the action today . The Treasury was especially intent over the outcome of a decision which would prescribe whether payment on interest and principal at the rate of $1.693 for each $1 was legal on all obligations incurred prior to June 5 , 1933 , including gold certificates . in the week the joint resolution was passed , government obligations amounted to 21 billions , of which 7 billions have since been retired . Private obligations had been estimated at 75 billions , and Federal commitments , other than government bonds and notes , were estimated at 5 billions . Financing is Faced in March . On March 14 the Treasury must meet interest payments on bonds and notes with a face value of 3,167 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and meet interest charges on an additional 3,940 millions in notes and bonds ( described in detail in another column today ) . During the period when the gold clause repeal was being rushed to enactment , examination of the newspaper files shows that little was said by critics of a Supreme Court reversal . The proposal was sharply attacked but almost invariably on ground of " repudiation " and as contrary to public policy and public ethics . Senator Reed of Pennsylvania , Representative Luce and other Republicans challenged the proposed repeal of the gold clause as unconstitutional . but the news stories do not show that they or others warned of a Supreme Court reversal .
