Prince Edward of Kent , 6th in line of succession to the Throne , was officially announced to have " entertained " his parents the Duke and Duchess of Kent last week on his first birthday . Prince Edward wore the latest thing in woolen suits , knitted for him by Queen Mary , and during afternoon tea cooed and gurgled at his sugar cake with one candle . His mother last week canceled all social engagements for the winter , thus intimating to the pleased British populace that she is expecting a second child . Queen Mary 's amiable brother Alexander Augustus Frederick William Alfred George Cambridge , 1st Earl of Athlone and onetime Governor General of the Union of South Africa , added to the gaiety of the annual Lorfdon Antique Dealers ' Fair by remarking publicly of his popular wife Princess Alice : " I always have the greatest difficulty in getting her away from the window of an art dealer 's shop . She remains there with her nose glued to the glass rather like a child looking into a tuck shop . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emblematic beast of Wales , was seen to have vanished last week along with the three " Prince of Wales " feathers from the arms of the Duchy of Cornwall , as new emblems designed by the College of Arms were submitted for the approval of King Edward . <P> The reasons for dropping the dragon and feathers , while not set forth by the College of Arms , were assumed to have something to do with the fact that there is no Prince of Wales . The immense revenues which previously went to the Prince of Wales from the Duchy of Cornwall now appertain to His Majesty , although when he first came to the Throne experts disputed weightily whether he retained the title Duke of Cornwall . It has also been arranged that military groups designated hitherto as " The Prince of Wales ' Own " retain that designation and their bands continue to play their stirring march , God Bless The Prince of Wales . <P> Young Archibald Fairley of Dundee , who found stunned upon the ground and nursed back to health a pigeon belonging to King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigeons which arrived in a crate lettered : " LIVE BIRDS - URGENT- FROM HIS MAJESTY THE KING . " A horse of exceptional gentleness named Cherry Grove was discovered in the stable of the Salford mounted police and bought for $750 to become the " charger " which will bear His Majesty through the streets of London on State occasions . Cherry Grove was first elaborately tested in the stableyard of the Metropolitan Police . <P> There life-sized dummy-policemen and dummy-pedestrians bob about on wires , horns are tooted , whistles blown to determine which horses are gentle enough to be safe under royalties , both visiting and British .
