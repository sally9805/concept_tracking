txt Work for Garage Men . To the Editor of The New York Times : For the last six months many good , willing garage workers have been unable to find work because automobile owners have eliminated regular servicing of their cars in order to obtain the lower rate which garages offer for storage without service , thus necessitating the laying off of thousands of men . The difference in the rate , with garage owners willing and anxious to help in the present emergency , is very small . It seems to rite that car owners can collectively promote a strong move for decreasing unemployment , and at the same time derive a large personal satisfaction , materially and morally , at a small cost for which they receive value , by putting their cars on regular service . HUGO , LENZER . New York , Nov. 26 , 1930 . Another Disappointed One . To the Editor of The New York Times : I have always believed that a purchased ticket guaranteed the purchaser 's comfortably hearing a debate . But evidently that was not guaranteed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nov. 23 . Unable , after several attempts , to hear the speakers , I asked a representative of the lecture bureau if my money would be refunded . " No , " he said . " I can hear them . " " I ca n't hear them , " I told him . " You do n't want to hear them , " was the surprising reply , in spite of the fact that I so wanted to hear the debate that I had purchased my ticket two weeks in advance ! H. JACK RICKERT .
