Shields , superintendent of the Anti-Saloon League of New Jersey , described eight speakeasies of Chestnut Hill , Philadelphia , which he visited Saturday as the guest of Mr. Joseph S. Clark Jr. , chairman of the Philadelphia Committee of the Crusaders , an organization working to effect repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment . Dr. Shields ' tour followed a recent debate with Mr. Clark at Moorestown , , N. J. , ' on the merits of prohibition . Dr. Shields . demanded to be shown some of the evil influence of speakeasIes which Mr. Clarkoledared were making the Chestnut Hill section where he lives objectionable , holding that it was time the wets made good their statements , that conditions ? were " infinitely worse than they used to be , " when there were open saloons , beer dance halls and dives .

They rapped and were admitted into a " dingy and unattractive room , " where the proprietor had to be assured they were not " a couple of ' clicks ' , " before he brought out from behind the piano a quart bottle ,
