To the Editor of The Nov " York Times : Six years ago the United States Supreme Court declared that a law of the State of Minnesota fixing I the price of milk was invalid and a violation of the Fourteenth ' Amendment ( 274 U. S. 1 ) . Four years ago the same court held that a law of the State of Tennessee fixing the price of gasoline was void because " a State Legislature is without constitutional power to fix prices at which commodities may be sold " ( 278 U. S. 235 ) . Not long ago a law of the State of New York limiting the amount a theatre ticket speculator could charge in addition to the box-office price was declared unconstitutional ( 273 U. S. 418 ) . The United States Supreme Court has declared repeatedly in price-fixing cases that " Happily for all , the fundamental guarantees of the Constitution can not be submerged if and whenever some ostensible justification is advanced and the police power invoked . " Lawyers are generally assumed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighty-five lawyers in the New York Legislature and I should like to have some of them explain the constitutional justification for the milk law .
