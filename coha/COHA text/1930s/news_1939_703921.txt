txt At least part of the reductions made late last month in automobile production schedules for this month and for the quarter a re likely to be restored next week Field sales reports for the first 10 days of this month , compilation of which is just being completed by factories here . indicate strongly that the upturn in domestic retail demand of the last 10 days of March picked up further momentum early this month . Final figures of two makes and preliminary figures of five other makes- show that in all instances the rate of gain over 1936 was higher for the first part of April than fin the : month rtf March . Buick Shows 42% Gain Buick sales of the first ten days totaled 6.639 units . up 42 , , - ; , over a year ago and 14,1 , over the first ten days of March : Buick 's gain for the month of March was 35 . Ponuac sales for the first April period amounted to 5.138 units , a gain of 73 ' /i over a year ago and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ago was 44.4% . Similarly . four other makes ' preliminary figures indicate early April gains of around 70% over last year , and of better than 20% over last month . Their March gains averaged slightly above 50% . However , despite the highly encouraging retail sales experience of the first 10 days of this month , estimates made two weeks ago the factory output would run to around 350.000 to 385.000 units still appear to be somewhat too high , in view of reduced orders in the hands of suppliers . Should some of the reductions made earlier be restored , as appears highly probably . April output of cars and trucks now seems more likely to approximate 340,000-375,000 units . ' Weather Affects Current Business Reversal of the springlike weather conditions of early April , and prevalence of rain and snow and much lower temperature in a broad band of northern states , has temporarily lessened hopes for a strong sales showing for the current , ten-day reporting period , which ends Thursday . At the same time , sales officials point out that it still would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there is a quick return of seasonal weather conditions . Output of most makes is proceeding at this time at about the daily or weekly rate of last month , but the April totals will be below March , unless schedules are stepped up , because there are fewer working days this month than last . three less for the companies operating five days a week and two less for those on a four ? day basis . Truck Output Higher Truck output in most instances is running at the highest levels of the year to date , as much as 20% above March for some makes , and thus is largely offsetting the curtailment in passenger car assemblies . Output of cars this week will show a gain of about 1.000 units over last week 's total of 87.000 , which compared with 86,000 in the previous week and 58,000 a year ago , Ward 's report estimates . With March marking the end of the finished car inventory accumulation period , the industry 's production through the few remaining months of the 1939 model run will be geared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' supplies of cars are now in dealer stocks , according to the new Dow ' . Jones &; Co. index , and this is generally considered in the industry to be about the ideal stocks-to-sales ratio for this season . As estimated at 340,000-375,000 cars and trucks . output this month would compare with around 385,000 last month and 238,129 a year ago . April Rise Is Usual Except for last year , assemblies in each of the past 10 years had shown a rise in April over March . The average rise is 10.2% for the years 1936-38 during which the industry has been on its present seasonal basis . However , despite the sub-seasonal total possible this month , output of the first four months of this year still will be somewhat ahead of expectations , inasmuch as first quarter production at around 1,051,000 units was almost 4% ahead of the previous quarter . Average change of the past three years has been a decline of 12.2% from the December to the March quarter . While the current quarter 's outlook is highly confused , general anticipation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be assembled . This would represent a considerably less than seasonal gain over the March three months , but it would be exactly in line with the Industry 's frequently repeated prediction of a 3,500,000-car year for 1939 . Such production would bring the first six mor  --  ths ' total to around 2.000,000 and would leave only 1,500,000 assemblies for the final six months . Excepting 1938 , third quarter output has not been below 500,000 units since 1932. and fourth quarter output has not been below 1,000 , - 000 since 1834 . Thus companies such as General Motors , Chrysler , Nash and Studebaker which are obtaining their projected share of the 3,500,000-car market and have their operations adjusted accordingly are likely to produce satisfactory earn . Inge this quarter , even in the face of a contraseasonal let-up in factory sales . Further , if the final half of this year continues to come up to the 3,500.000 unit expectation , as now seems probable , these companies ' results for the full year 1939 should be favorable , particularly in comparison with last year 's depressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leonard refrigerators , made by Nash-Kelvinators Corp. , totaled 4,681 units . This was a gain of 3,376 units , or 386% , over the 1,305 shipments 0/ March , 1938.
