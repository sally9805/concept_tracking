txt // his mind from the troubles of the time , partly to occupy the now duller hours of his leisure , devoted them , with the aid of his daughter , to literature ; and , besides compiling A Chronicle and Historic of the House and Surname of Seatone , and composing a good many poetical pieces , he set himself to gather the collection of Scottish MS. poetry , which , copied out by his daughter , is now preserved in the Pepysian library of Magdalene College , Cambridge . In his poetry , as well as otherwise , he is a survival of the ante-reformation period . As regards both the form and spirit of his verse , he is a disciple of Dunbar , though his satire lacks Dunbar 's boisterous humour and keenness of wit , and his reflective pieces Dunbar 's emotional pungency . He has nothing in common with Lyndsay  - -  though quite alive to the evils of the old regime , he did not , while it existed , make them the object of his satire ; nor , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuaded of that regime 's perfection . In Quhair is the Blytheness that has been he laments the decay of the old merry customs , and in his Miseries of the Tyme he bewails the lack of any real amendment either in church or state . Like his famous son , William the secretary , he was more an enlightened patriot and a shrewd man of the world than either an ecclesiastical or political partisan . The evils of internal dissension and strife are set forth by him in the poems Of the Assemblie of the Congregation , 1559 , and On the New Yeir , 156o ; and , at a later period , he advocated a reconciliation of the two parties in Againis the Division of the Lordis , On Union among the Lordis , Againis Discord among the Lordis and Lament for the Disorders of the Cuntrie . He brought to the consideration of social , political and religious questions much of the impartiality and practical worldly wisdom of the judge ; and his satire is severest when he deals with social disorders or violations of the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Theivis of Liddisdaill , the latter of which has something of the denunciatory rush of Dunbar 's Donald Owre , on which it is modelled . In The Satire of the Toun Ladeis , an amusing recital of the extravagant caprices of contemporary female fashions , his tone is mainly that of half cynical , half good-humoured mockery , while his verses on the Folye of Ane auld man maryand ane Young Woman , are shrewdly sententious and mildly witty in the subAlexander // stive fashion characteristic of the time . The Ballat of the realness of the World , prompted , it may be , like Lyndsay 's Dialog , by a perusal of the translation of the Scriptures , and ritten in the stave of The Cherrie and the Slue , indicates his acceptance of the conventional beliefs of his time ; but the K m is a very uninspired performance ; and much more of is real self appears in the half humorous , half melancholy usings of such pieces as Na Kyndes without Siller , Gude ounseillis , Advyce to lesum Merynes and Solace of Aige. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much account as a tirist ; but his verse is of considerable interest as a record of c ingenuous sentiments of a highly accomplished and upright an , who , at this troubled and critical period of Scottish hiswry , kept , in a manner , aloof from both parties . Alexander Scott , almost the only lyrist , except such as are onymous , of importance amongst the old Scottish poets , ands still more aloof in spirit than Maitland from the emotional and fervent zeal of the reformers . His poetry is enrely secular in theme and manner , with the exception of a anslation of two psalms , the first and the fiftieth , which , though cleverly rimed , are both of them rather frigid and echanical . Seeing Montgomery refers to him , in 1584 , as old Scott , " he was probably born not later than towards the ? se of the first quarter of the sixteenth century . If , again , is supposed Lament of the Master of Erskine be properly wiled , he most likely began to write not later than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been the lover of the ? 1 wen dowager , was slain at Pinkie in that year , and the poem is edited with embodying his imaginary farewell to her . Of lay must , also , have been written before the act of parliament ? a sled in 1555 against the old May celebrations ; and , although le only other poem of his that can be dated is his New Yeir Gift to Queen Mary , 1562 , none of his verses that have been reserved is of later date than 1568 . Of the thirty-six pieces of which Scott is known to be the thor , thirty are of an amatory character , and the majority of em seem to have been greatly influenced in style and spirit the love lyrics in Tottel 's Miscellany , 1557 , whether Scott ( l an acquaintance with such pieces before they were publied or not . To Scott 's verse there thus attaches a certain // special interest , as suggesting the possibility of a new school of Scottish poetry , which , while retaining certain northern characteristics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English school ; but this possibility had already been made futile by the triumph of a puritanic reformation . Scott was a creation of the ante-reformation period ; and , although his themes and his method of treatment are partly suggested by the lyrical school of England , he may still be regarded as , primarily , the pupil of Dunbar . The influence of the English school is modified by characteristics that are distinctly Scottish . While the Miscellany seems to have suggested to him the appropriateness of short staves for certain forms of the love lyric , he was not content to confine himself to the staves that were there represented ; as a metrist he belongs properly to the school of the old Scottish " makaris . " Besides utilising several of Dunbar 's staves he had recourse to a variety of earlier staves in rime couee ; and in the use of these medieval forms he shows a consummate mastery . His distinct poetic gift is shown in the facility , the grace and the musical melody of his verse , and his power of mirroring sentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also qualities in the tone and spirit of his verse that individualise it and distinguish it from the lyrical school of England . It is not so much imitative , as representative of his own characteristic personality . He is terser , more pungent , more aphoristic than the English lyrists . In most of his lyrics , the emotional note vibrates more strongly ? in the utterance of joy , as in Up Helsum Hairt ; in the expression of sorrowful resignation , as in The Lament of the Master of Erskine , and Oppressit Hairt Indure ; or in the record of his amatory experiences , as in Lo Quhat it is to Lute ; and it may further be added that when , as in the Ballad maid to the Derisioun and Scorne of Wantoun Wemen , he is indecorous , he evinces a grossness that his English contemporaries can not rival . Apart from his lyrics and his translation of two psalms , the only other pieces of Scott arc The New Yeir 's Gift , and The Justing and Debait . In the former , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he devotes himself to a recital of the social evils of the time , more after the manner of Maitland than of Lyndsay ; and he concludes with an envoy in which he gives an // elaborate display of his accomplishments in alliteration and internal rime . The Justing and Debait , written in the Christis Kirk stave , is a mock tournament piece after the fashion of Dunbar 's Turnament and Lyndsay 's Justing , but less an uproarious burlesque than a lightly witty narrative . Alexander Montgomerie , the last of the Scottish " makaris , " probably held some office at the court of James VI , and , most likely , was the king 's chief instructor in the art of verse He has a good deal in common with Scott , of whom he may be reckoned a kind of disciple . His temperament was , however , less poetical ; he lacked Scott 's geniality as well as artistic grace ; he was more varied and voluminous ; he was a still greater , if a less successful , experimenter in curious metres , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was , in some respects , still more influenced by the English school . Still , like Scott , as a metrist , he belongs to the Scottish school , the metres which he invents being merely modified reconstructions and combinations of the old ones , while what staves , as the " ballade , " he borrows from the English lyric school , have a certain similarity to the old staves , the only difference in the " ballade " stave being the modern lilt of the double refrain . Even in the sonnet , of which he left no fewer than seventy examples , he has a certain non-English individuality ; for while , in some instances , he adopted the sonnet forms of Tottel 's Miscellany , he also translated several of Ronsard 's sonnets in the Ronsard form , and wrote a Ronsard variation . Further , his connection with the old Scottish school is seen in his use of the old rimed alliterative stave of the romances in Ane Answer to ane Helandmains Invective and in the Flyting between him and Sir Patrick Hume of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , apparently , The Cherrie and the Slae ; but its popularity had only an indirect connection with its poetic merits . These are not remarkable and are not superior to those of The Bankis of Helicon , which is in the same measure . But , in The Cherrie and the Slae , Montgomerie does not , as in The Bankis of Helicon , have recourse to aureate terms or classical imagery . Though somewhat dull and archaic as an allegory , the piece as regards its language is perfectly simple and unaffected ; in the descriptions of nature there are no attempts at meretricious // ornaments ; they represent the fresh and quite unsophisticated pleasure and admiration of the average person ; while the general drift of the poem is obscure , it is pervaded by the maxims of that homely and commonplace philosophy of the repetition of which the average uneducated person never tires ; and , finally , the quatorzain in which the piece is written , was , with the peculiar jingle of its wheels , well adapted to catch the popular ear , although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the recitativos of The Jolly Beggars . As a very varied metrist in what James VI termed " cuttit and broken verse , " Montgomerie showed both remarkable ingenuity and a good musical ear ; but he was not a poetic melodist ? partly from his despondent views of life and deficiency in animal spirits , his verses are , for the most part , lacking in poetic flow . His reflective pieces are too low-spirited to be effective ; his amatory verse is not animated by much lyrical fervour ; and his religious pieces and versions of psalms , sometimes written to special tunes , while characterised by apt phrasing and considerable metrical felicity , do not manifest much fervour or depth of conviction . Yet The Night is near Gone has the true accent of poetry , and , in several other pieces , he has poetic moments . With Montgomerie , the school of the old " makaris " properly ends . While James VI , who , in 1591 , published Poetical Exercises at Vacant Hours , remained in Scotland , poetry was practised by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Triumphs of Petrarch , and Stewart of Baldines presented the king with Ane Abbregement of Roland Furious translated out of Aroist ; but both works are preserved only in manuscript , the one in the Edinburgh university library and the other in the Advocates ' library . In 1590 , John Burel wrote a Descriptioun of the queen 's entry into Edinburgh , and an allegorical piece The Passage of the Pilgrim , but neither has much merit . Poetry , except of a religious kind , now came under taboo , and the religious verse was of a very mediocre character . Alexander Arbuthnot , principal of Aberdeen university , amused his leisure hours by cultivating the secular muse , but , as he relates , in secret , and with fear and trembling , lest " with rascal rymours I sail raknit be . " On the other hand , Alexander Hume , minister of // Logie and younger brother of the Hume of Montgomerie 's Flyting , sought to substitute " for prophane sonnets and vain ballads of love " a series of Hymns and Sacred Songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scottish to English verse , and , equally so , the fatal decay in Scotland of poetic inspiration . In the succeeding century , the writing of verse , mostly in the English language and form , was practised by certain of the Scottish gentry ; but , as regards the bulk of the people , secular poetry remained for nearly two centuries under an ecclesiastical ban . CHAPTER VII Reformation and Renascence in Scotland I N the year 1528 , three events occurred in Scotland , which , as the near future was to prove , were fraught with pregnant consequences alike for the state and for the national religion and national literature . In that year , James V , after a long tutelage , became master of his kingdom ; Patrick Hamilton , the " protomartyr " of the Scottish reformation , was burnt ; and Sir David Lyndsay published his first work , The Dreme . Taken together , these three events point to the fact that Scotland was entering on a new phase of her national life , and at the same time indicate the character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wrought in the national aims and ideals the chief Scottish literature of the period received its distinctive stamp , and we have but to recall its representative productions ? those of the anonymous authors of The Gude and Godlie Ballatis , of John Knox and of George Buchanan ? to realise the gulf that separates it from the period immediately preceding . From James I to Gavin Douglas , Scottish literature had been mainly imitative , borrowing its spirit , its models and its themes from Chaucer and other sources . The characteristic aim of this literature had , on the whole , been pleasure and amusement ; and , if it touched on evils in the state , in the church or in society , it had no direct and conscious purpose of assailing the institutions under which the nation had lived since the beginning of the Middle Ages . Totally different were the character and aim of the representative literature of the period which may be dated from the publication of Lyndsay 's Dreme in 1528 to the union of the crowns in 1603 . The literature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , and was the direct expression of the convictions and passions of 156 The Reformation in Scotland 15 7 that section of the nation which was eventually to control its destinies and to inform the national spirit . Not pleasure or amusement but strenuous purpose directed to practical results was the motive and note of this later period ; its aim was to reach the heart of the people , and the forms which it assumed were exclusively determined by the consideration of this end . Between the years 1520 and 1530 , there were already indications that a crisis was approaching in the national history which would involve a fundamental change in traditional modes of thought on all the great questions concerning human life . The problem which the nation had to face was whether it would abide by its ancient religion or adopt the teaching of Luther , the writings of whose followers were finding their way into the country at every convenient port . But this question involved another of almost equally far-reaching importance ? was France or England to be Scotland 's future ally ? Should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must hold fast to existing institutions ; there would he no change of religion and no essential change in hereditary habits of thought and sentiment . Throughout the period now opening , these were the great issues that preoccupied the nation , and it was from the conflict between them that the most important literary productions of the age received their impulse , their tone and their characteristic forms . The literature produced under these conditions was essentially a reformation literature , and its relation to the movement of the reformation is its predominating characteristic . Nevertheless , though Scotland received her most powerful impulse from the reformation , the renascence did not leave her wholly untouched , though conditions peculiar to herself prevented her from deriving the full benefit of that movement . Her scanty population and her limited resources were in themselves impediments to the expansion of the spirit which was the main result of the revival of learning . The total population of Scotland in the sixteenth century can not have been much over 500,000 , of whom only about half used a Teutonic form of speech . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small proportion who , by natural aptitude and by fortunate circumstances , were in a position to profit by the new current that was quickening the other nations of western 1 58 Reformation and Renascence in Scotland Europe . The poverty of the country , due to the nature of the soil rather than to any lack of strenuousness on the part of its people , equally hindered the development of a rich and various national life . Scotland now possessed three universities ; but to equip these in accordance with the new ideals of the time was beyond her resources , and the same difficulty stood in the way of maintaining great schools such as the renascence had originated in other countries . Finally , the renascence was checked in Scotland , more than in any other country , by the special conditions under which the reformation was here accomplished . From the beginning to the end of the struggle , the Scottish reformers had to contend against the consistent opposition of the crown , and it was only as the result of civil war that the victory of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period when the renascence was in full tide , Scotland was spending her energies in a contest which absorbed the best minds of the country ; and a variety of causes debarred her from an adequate participation in that humanism which , in other countries , was widening the scope of thought and action , and enriching literature with new forms and new ideas . Nevertheless , though the renascence failed in any marked degree to affect the general national life , it found , both in literature and in action , distinguished representatives who had fully imbibed its spirit . It is from the preaching of Patrick Hamilton in 1527 , followed by his execution in 1528 , that Knox dates the beginning of the reformation in Scotland ; and it is a production of Hamilton , Patrikes Places , that he adduces as the first specimen of its literature . " Literature , " however , this document can hardly be called , as it is merely a brief and bald statement of the Lutheran doctrine of justification by faith , originally written in Latin , and translated into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginnings of the Scottish reformation is a more voluminous writer , Alexander Alane ( for this and not Aless was his real name , as appears from the registers of the university of St. Andrews ) , but better known by his Latin designation , Alesius . Born in Edinburgh in 1500 , Alesius was trained for the church in the university of St. Andrews . In an attempt to convince Hamilton of the error of his ways , he was shaken in his own faith , and susAlesius . Plays 59 picions soon arose regarding his own orthodoxy . A Latin oration delivered against the vices of the clergy left no room for doubt regarding his religious sympathies , and he was thrown into prison , whence , with the aid of friends , he escaped to the continent ( 1532 ) . Alesius never returned to Scotland , but , both in England and Germany , he played an important part in forwarding the cause of the reformation . He is the author of at least twenty-eight works , all written in Latin , partly consisting of commentaries on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theological controversies of the time . Of his controversial writings , three have special reference to religious opinion in Scotland ? Epistola contra Decretum quoddam Episcoporum in Scotia , quod prohibet legere Novi Testamenti Libros lingua vernacula ( 1533 ) ; Responsio ad Cochlaei Calumnias ( 1533 ) ; and Cohortatio ad Concordiam ( 1544 ) . The question discussed in all these productions is the liberty of reading the Scriptures in the original ? a liberty which was first granted by the Scottish parliament in 1543 , and to which Alesius may have materially contributed . To Alesius , also , we owe the earliest known description of his native city of Edinburgh , which he contributed to the Cosmographia of Sebastian Munster ( 15 5o ) . More interesting for the literary history of the period is Knox 's mention of Kyllour 's play , The History of Christ 's Passion , to which reference has already been made . ' Of Kyllour and his play we know nothing beyond the casual reference of Knox . It is matter for greater regret that two plays , mentioned by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . The subjects of the two plays point to the preoccupations of the age ? the one being a tragedy on John the Baptist , a favourite handle for satirical attacks on the evils of church and state , and the other a comedy on Dionysius the Tyrant . Scanty as these references are , they lead to the conclusion that dramatic representations furnished the means by which the champions of the new religion first sought to communicate their teaching to the people . But scenic displays were not the most effectual vehicles for spreading their tenets throughout the nation ; only a comparatively small public could be reached by them , and the state had it always . 160 Reformation and Renascence in Scotland in its power to prohibit them , when they overstepped the limits prescribed by the law . Another form of literature , therefore , was required , at once less overt and of wider appeal , if the new teaching was to reach the masses of the people ; and such a vehicle was now to be found . It was about the year 1546 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible itself , did more for the spread of reformation doctrines than any other book published in Scotland . As no copy of this edition has been preserved , we can only conjecture its contents from the first edition of which we possess a specimen ? that of 1567 , apparently an enlarged edition of the original . The book generally known in Scotland as The Gude and Godlie Ballatis is , next to Knox 's Historic of the ref ormatioun , the most memorable literary monument of the period in vernacular Scots . The chief share in the production of this volume , also known as The Dundee Book , may , almost with certainty , be assigned to three brothers , James , John and Robert Wedderburn , sons of a rich Dundee merchant , all of whom had studied at the university of St. Andrews , and were for a time exiled for their attachment to the reformed doctrines . Besides a metrical translation of the Psalms , the book contained a number of Spirituall Sangis and Plesand Ballatis , the object of which was to convey instruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stigmatise the iniquities and errors of the Roman church . Of both songs and ballads , fully one half are more or less close translations from the popular German productions which had their origin in the Lutheran movement . But the most remarkable pieces in the book are those which adapt current secular songs and ballads to spiritual uses , appropriating the airs , measures , initial lines or choruses of the originals . This consecration of profane effusions was not unknown in the medieval church , and for the immediate object in view a more effective literary form could not have been devised . At a time when books were clear and were , in general , little read , these Godly Ballads , set to popular tunes , served at once the purpose of a pamphlet and a sermon , conveying instruction , while , at the same time , they roused to battle . What amazes the reader of the present day in these compositions is the grotesque blending of religion with , ell the coarseness and scurrility of the age . Yet this John Knox . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the intense conviction of their authors : in the message they had to proclaim they believed there was an effectual safeguard against all evil consequences , and that in the contrast between the flesh and the spirit the truth would only be made more manifest . Moreover , there is an accent and a strain in the Ballads which is not to be found in Lyndsay even in his highest mood . Even when he is most in earnest , Lyndsay never passes beyond the zeal of the social reformer . In the Ballads , on the other hand , there is often present a yearning pathos as of soul speaking to soul , which transmutes and purifies their coarsest elements , and transfuses the whole with a spiritual rapture . And the influence that the Ballads exercised ? mainly on the inhabitants of the towns , which almost universally declared for the reformation ? proves that the writers had not misjudged their readers . For fully half a century , though unsanctioned by ecclesiastical authority , the Ballads held their place as the spiritual songs of the reformation church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Knox , who was to be at once the chief leader of the Scottish reformation and its chief literary exponent . The work is entitled An Epistle to the Congregation of the Castle of St. Andrews : with a Brief Summary of Balnaves on Justification by Faith , and , as its author informs us , was written in Rouen , while he was " lying in irons and sore troubled by corporall infirmitie , in a galley named Nostre Dame . " Like all the other works of Knox , it was prompted by an immediate occasion and was directed to an immediate practical purpose . So closely linked , indeed , are the six volumes of his writings to his public career , that they are virtually its running commentary . From first to last his one concern was to secure the triumph of reformation doctrine , as he conceived it , and it would be difficult to find a sentence in his writings which does not bear more or less directly on this object . To all secular interests , except so far as they touched religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the reformers of every type , he had a profound conviction , as his action was notably to prove , that education was the true handmaid of piety . His eulogy on his countryman , the humanist George Buchanan , shows that a pietas literata was no less his ideal than it was that of 162 Reformation and Renascence in Scotland Melanchthon . " That notable man Mr. George Buchanan , " he writes , " remains to this day , the year of God , 1566 years , to the glory of God , to the great honour of the nation and to the comfort of them that delight in letters and virtue . " A religion based on the Bible , as he understood it , and a national system of education which should provide for every grade of study and utilise every special gift for the general well-being ? such were the aims of Knox 's public action and the burden of his testimony in literature . With one great exception , no productions of Knox possess more than a historical interest as the expression of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion of which he was the unflinching exponent . Mainly controversial in character , neither by their literary quality nor by their substance were they found of permanent value even bythose to whom they made special appeal . The long list of his writings , which had begun with The Epistle on Justification , was continued in England , where , for five years , we find him acting as an officially commissioned preacher of the reformation as it was sanctioned by the government of Edward VI . The titles of the pieces which he threw off during this period sufficiently indicate their nature and scope : A Vindication of the Doctrine that the Sacrifice of the Mass is Idolatry ( 1550 ) , A Summary according to the Holy Scriptures of the Sacrament of the Lord 's Supper ( 1550 ) , A Declaration of the True Nature and Object of Prayer ( 1553 ) and The Exposition upon the Sixth Psalm of David ( 1554 ) ? The accession of Mary Tudor in July , 1553 , made England an impossible place for protestants like Knox , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit to Scotland , were spent on the continent , mainly in Geneva , where Calvin had already established his supremacy . Knox 's exile on the continent gave occasion to another series of productions , all prompted by some pressing question of the moment . The protestants in England had to be comforted and encouraged during their trying experiences under the government of Mary Tudor , and this end he sought to accomplish in his Two comfortable Epistles to his afflicted Brethren in England ( 1554 ) and in his Faithful Admonition to the Professors of God 's Truth in England ( 1554 ) ? the latter of which , however , by its ill-timed attack on the existing authoriJohn // ties in England , did not improve the position of those for whose good it was intended . In 1554 , Knox was appointed to the charge of a congregation of English exiles in Frankfort-on-theMain , but , within a year , there arose such a storm of controversy on points of doctrine and ceremonies that he was fain to demit his charge and retire to Geneva . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congregation at Frankfurt on the Maine , 1554-5 , Knox gave his story of the controversy , the historical interest of which is that out of it grew the two parties which were eventually to divide the Church of England ? the party of puritanism ( of which Knox is to be regarded as one of the chief founders ) , and the party which accepted Elizabeth 's policy of compromise . The condition of the protestants in Scotland under the regency of Mary of Lorraine evoked another series of long epistles , the burden of which was an arraignment of the policy of the government and an exhortation to the faithful to look confidently forward to a day fast coming when the true religion would prevail . From 1555 to 1559 , with the exception of a visit to Scotland during part of the years 1555 and 1556 , Knox made his home in Geneva , where he acted , for a time , as copastor to a congregation of English exiles , more in harmony with his own opinions than that of Frankfort . His passionate desire , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but this desire he saw thwarted by the two female rulers who now governed these countries . It was out of the indignation of his baffled hopes , therefore , that , in 1558 , he published his First Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstruous Regiment of Women , which of all his works had the widest notoriety in his own day . From the classical writers , the Roman law , the Bible and the Fathers , he supports the argument for which he vehemently contends ? that " to promote a Woman to beare rule , superioritie , dominion , or empire above any Realme , Nation or Citie is repugnant to nature , contumelie to God , a thing most contrarious to his reveled will and approved ordinance . " In his main contention , Knox was at one with the most influential writers of the sixteenth century , Jean Bodin among others , but , even by divines of his own way of thinking , his pamphlet was generally regarded as a hasty and ill-considered performance . In 1559 , it was 164 Reformation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Marian exiles , subsequently bishop of London , in his Harborowe for Faithfull and Trewe Subjectes agaynst the late blowne Blaste concerning the Government of Women , in which the most effective point made is that , as a limited monarchy , England is specially guarded from the drawbacks incident to female sovereignty . But the course of public events proved to be the most stringent commentary on the contention of the Blast . At the close of the very year of its publication Mary Tudor died and the protestant Elizabeth succeeded to the throne of England ? an event which Knox was bound to recognise as the happiest dispensation for the welfare of his own cause . While still in Geneva , Knox produced another work , of less resounding notoriety than the Blast , but a more solid and careful performance . This was his Answer to a great Nomber of blasphemous cavillations written by an Anabaptist and adversarie to God 's eternal Predestination . Like all his more important works , it was prompted by the circumstances of the moment . The dogma of predestination was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knox looked as his spiritual father , but the doctrine had been impugned by many , and notably by Sebastian Castalio , who had been expelled from Geneva for the general heterodoxy of his opinions . From the protestants in England , also , there came a request to their brethren in Geneva that they would prepare a reply to a book which had recently been written against the same dogma , and to Knox was assigned the task . The result was his lengthy treatise on predestination which fills one volume of the six that comprise his published works . It is Knox 's most elaborate effort in constructive theology , but , strenuous and dexterous though he is in meeting the arguments of his adversary , he possessed neither the self-control nor the systematising genius which made his master , Calvin , the lawgiver of reformed doctrine . It is to Calvin 's Institutes of the Christian Religion , and not to Knox 's treatise , that the followers of both must have recourse for the magistral statement of the constitutive dogma of their theological system . The triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restored Knox to his native country , where his presence was to be the dominating fact in the political and religious " Historic of the Reformatioun in Scotland " 165 situation , and where he was to produce the work which is the great literary monument of the time . As the immediate result of the victory of protestantism , appeared the First Book of Discipline , of which Knox was not , indeed , the sole author , but which bears his imprint on every page , and is the brief summary of his ideals in religion and education . Here , as directly connected with the literary history of Scotland , we are only concerned with the scheme of national instruction which the book sets forth with detailed precision . In every parish there was to be a school and in every important town a college , from which the aptest scholars were to be sent to the three universities ? attendance in all three grades being exacted by state and church . The poverty of the country and protracted civil commotions prevented the scheme from being realised ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of sight , and , during successive centuries , the parish schools of Scotland were the nursing-homes of her most vigorous intellectual life . Like all his other works , Knox 's Historic of the ref ormatioun in Scotland was suggested by an immediate occasion and was written to serve a special purpose . Its express aim was to justify the proceedings of the protestant leaders who had been the chief instruments in overthrowing the ancient religion , and it was at their desire that he undertook the task . His book , therefore , is essentially that of an apologist and not of a historian ; and he makes no disguise of the fact . That right and justice were all on one side and that those who opposed the reformation were blinded either by folly or iniquity , is his unflinching contention from the first sentence to the last . So transparent is this assumption , however , that it hardly misleads the reader ; and through what he may consider the perversion of characters and events he can not fail to discern their salient and essential traits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's book , his interviews with queen Mary , the weak points in his own cause and in his own personal character are as manifest as those of his adversary . The History consists of five books , the last of which , however , is so inferior in vigour to the others that its materials must have been put together by another hand . It is in the first book , which traces the beginning and progress of the reformation in Scotland , that Knox displays his most striking gifts as a writer ? such passages as 166 Reformation and Renascence in Scotland those describing the rout of Solway Moss , the mission and death of George Wishart and the battle of Pinkie being the nearest anticipation of Carlyle to be found in English literature . In the second and third books , we have one of the earliest examples of an appeal to historical documents as vouchers for the truth of the narrative : fully three-fourths of these books consisting of papers supplied by the leaders of the reformation in Scotland and England . But it is the fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national memory , and may be said to have created the prevalent conception of the Scottish reformation . The theme of this book is the return of Mary to Scotland , and the compromise that followed between her and the reforming leaders . Here we have the reports of the dramatic interviews between Mary and Knox , and of his fulminations from the pulpit in the church of St. Giles , and here , also , those characterisations of Mary and ether leading personages which are written for all time . What SainteBeuve said of the Memoirs of Saint-Simon may be said with even greater truth of Knox 's History : the periods before and after that which he describes are dim and obscure by comparison . And it is a further tribute to the literary interest and importance of the book , that it is the first original work in prose which Scotland had yet produced . There had been translations and compilations in prose , but there had not , as yet , been any work which bore the stamp of individual genius and which might serve as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in his long residence in England and association with Englishmen abroad , we have the explanation of the diction ? the anglicised Scots ? which was made a reproach to him by his Catholic adversaries . Knox 's History is the chief literary monument of the Scottish reformation ; but to the same period belong a number of works , more or less of a historical character , which prove that prose had now become an accredited vehicle of expression as well as verse . Next in literary quality to the work of Knox is The Historic and Cronicles of Scotland by Robert Lindesay of Pitscottie ? one of the few productions of the time which can be read with interest at the present day . Lindesay was an ardent protestant , and , in the parts of his History where he deals with the change of the national religion , he is a thoroughHistorians // going partisan . With religion , however , he is not primarily concerned , and his aim is not controversial like that of Knox . What mainly interested him in the past were picturesque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the leading actors ; and it is to him that we owe some of the most lively pictures in the national history . As his easy credulity as well as the structure of his book shows , Lindesay had no very severe criterion of historic accuracy . His account of the reign of James II ( 1436-6o ) , with which his History begins , is merely a translation of Hector Boece 's Latin History of Scotland ? a work of inventive imagination in which the wildest fables are recorded as ascertained facts . From 1542 onwards , he drew upon his own observation or on the testimony of eye-witnesses ; but it is precisely in this portion of his work that he exhibits in least degree that gift of vivid narrative which made him the delight of Sir Walter Scott as the nearest approach to a Scottish Froissart . Of a different order is the work of Sir James Melville of Halhill , who , first as page to queen Mary and , afterwards , as her ambassador , played a subordinate part in the transactions of his time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observations of what he had seen and heard in the course of his public life , still retain their value as one of the historical sources for the period . Though a protestant in religion , he possessed the confidence of Mary ; and his sympathies are with her and not with her rival , Elizabeth . Melville 's point of view is that of the courtier and the diplomatist , and in his decorous and sober pages there is little indication of the seething passions of the time . In the Memorials of Transactions in Scotland ( 1569 ? 73 ) of Richard Bannatyne , Knox 's secretary , we have another example of the stimulus given to historical narrative by the events of the reformation . In the form of a diary , Bannatyne records the events that he saw passing before his eyes in those momentous years when the victory of Protestantism was definitely assured by the surrender of Edinburgh Castle by the last champions of Mary . But the most memorable passages in the book are those which record the last days of his master , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorous style of his History . Another example of the general interest in contemporary events is the 168 Reformation and Renascence in Scotland Diary of Mr. James Melville , Minister of Kilrenny in Fife ( 1566-16or ) . Of the nature of an autobiography rather than of a diary , this is one of the most delightful books of the kind in the language . In the author himself , we have the most attractive type of the Presbyterian pastor , and his account of his home life and of his education at school and university is of high value as a picture of the life of the time . As a specimen of the Scottish language of the period , and as one of the best known passages in early Scottish literature , his description of Knox preaching at St. Andrews in his last days may hardly be passed over : I saw him everie day go hulie and fear ( slowly and warily ) with a furring of martricks ( martens ) about his neck , a staff in the an hand , and guid godly Richart Ballanden Bannatyne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) from the Abbaye to the parodic Kirk , and be the said Richart and another servent lifted upe to the pulpit , whar he behovit to lean at his first entrie ; bot or he haid done with his sermont he was sa active and vigorus , that he was lyk to ding that pulpit in blads ( break the pulpit in pieces ) and the out of it . A few other works , also of the nature of annals , though not attaining to the dignity of literature , may be noted as illustrating the interest in history which had been mainly occasioned by the revolutionary events of the period . The Diurnal of remarkable Occurents , a work by different hands , notes events from the time of James V till the year 1575 ; the period from 1566 to 1596 is dealt with in The Historie and Life of James the Sext , briefly continued till 1617 ; and , further , we have the Memoirs of the Affairs of Scotland ( 1577-1603 ) by David Moysie , and the Diary of Robert Birrel ( 1532-1605 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literary result of the reformation , but it did not check the tendency to versifying which had been assiduously practised throughout the reigns of the Jameses . In verse , however , there was produced no work comparable to Knox 's History in prose . However we may explain the fact , from the reformation dates a period of barrenness in imaginative literature , similar to that which in England followed the death of Chaucer , and it lasted to the poetic revival in the beginning of the eighteenth // century . With few exceptions , the verse written during the reformation struggle was prompted by the occasion of the hour ? its principal themes being the sensational events on which the destinies of the nation appeared to hang . Printed in black letter on one side of a leaf of paper , ballads of this character issued in a constant stream from the press of Robert Lekprevik , the Edinburgh printer . Almost all of them were written by supporters of the reformation , and are mainly coarse and virulent attacks on Mary and such conspicuous persons as were known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ballads have been ascribed are Robert Sempill , Sir John Maitland of Thirlstane , the Rev. John Davidson and Sir William Kirkcaldy of Grange . Of Sempill , the most prolific writer of his class , little is known beyond the fact that he was an ardent supporter of the reformation and an uncompromising enemy of queen Mary , and that he lived in the thick of the sensational events of his time . His two best pieces are the Sege of the Castel of Edinburgh and The Legend of a Lymaris Lyle , the coarse vigour of which sufficiently explains his temporary popularity ; but in none of his work does Sempill rise to the dignity of poetic satire which ensures permanent literary interest . Sir John Maitland ? better known in political than in literary history as the framer of the act of 1592 which has been called the Magna Charta of the Church of Scotland ? strikes a higher note than Sempill . In the three poems that have been attributed to him , Ane Admonition to my Lord Regentis Grace , Ane Schort Invectyve aganis the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tungis , there is a restraint , a good sense and dignity , which became one who filled successively the offices of a senator of the College of Justice , of secretary of state and of lord high chancellor of Scotland . To Sir William Kirkcaldy of Grange only one piece is assigned ? Ane Ballat of the Captane of the Castell ? that is , of Edinburgh , the last stronghold held for queen Mary , of which Kirkcaldy himself was the captain . Of little poetic merit , this ballad has at least the distinction of being one of the few in which loyalty to Mary is expressed with chivalrous and heartfelt devotion ? a devotion which he expiated with his life on the capture of the castle in 1573 . The reformation in Scotland had no more 1 70 Reformation and Renascence in Scotland strenuous adherent than the Rev. John Davidson , and , as he lived till 1603 , his uncompromising opinions brought him into frequent trouble with James VI in his policy of suppressing presbyterianism and introducing episcopacy . A personal friend and admiring disciple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time , sketched the main events of his career in Ane Brief Commendation of Uprichtness ? a valuable document for Knox 's biographers . To the eulogy of Knox is also devoted a second of the three poems known to be the work of Davidson ? Ane Schort Discurs of the Estaitis quha he s cans to deploir the Deith of this excellent Servand of God , the closing lines of which may be quoted as a specimen of the general level of his style : Lyke as himself is unto gloir , So sail all ages ay recyte Johne Knoxis Name with greit decoir . The writers who have been mentioned all belonged to the reforming party , but , throughout the whole period , the ancient church had also its representatives in literature , one of whom , at least , had a European reputation in his own day . This was John Mair or Major , who has been called " the last of the schoolmen , " and who is the one eminent thinker whom we can with certainty say that Scotland gave to scholasticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1549 Or 1550 , Major lived to see the beginnings of the reformation in Scotland , but , though in many respects a liberal thinker both in religion and politics , he continued to the end a steady adherent of the communion in which he was reared . After a year 's study ( 1493 ) at the university of Cambridge , Major passed to the university of Paris , where , till 1518 , with the exception of a brief visit to Scotland , he was successively student , regent in arts , and doctor in theology . From 1518 to 1525 , he lectured on logic and theology , first in the university of Glasgow and afterwards in the university of St. Andrews , where he had George Buchannon as one of his pupils . Between 1525 and 1531 , he was again in Paris , where he was now regarded by all the learned world ; Is t h ( ? most distinguished champion of medievalism in its opposition to the new studies . He had attained this reputation through the long series of his publications , Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which the most notable was his Commentary on the Four Books of the Sentences of Peter Lombard ( 1509 ) . In all these works , Major is the schoolman pure and simple ; the subjects he treats , his manner of handling them , are those of the medieval logician when scholasticism had become an exhausted movement . For the men of the new order , therefore , Major was an obscurantist against whom ridicule was the only appropriate weapon . Melanchthon selected him as the special object of attack in his reply to the condemnation of Luther by the Sorbonne . " I have seen John Major 's Commentaries on Peter Lombard , " he writes ; " he is now , I am told , the prince of the Paris divines . Good heavens ! What wagonloads of trifling . . . . If he is a specimen of the Parisian , no wonder they have so little stomach for Luther . " A shaft was aimed at Major by a still greater hand ; in the wonderful library of St. Victor in Paris , Pantagruel found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Major . Despite the mockery of the humanists , however , there are ideas and suggestions to he found in his voluminous disquisitions which prove that he was a shrewd and independent thinker when he addressed himself to practical questions . No reformer saw more clearly or denounced more stringently the corruptions and abuses of the church as it existed in Scotland ; he held as liberal opinions as his pupil Buchanan regarding the relations of rulers and subjects ; and a suggestion which he threw out as to the most effective method of dealing with mendicancy was adopted with fruitful results in Germany and the Low Countries . But his good sense and independent judgment are best exemplified in his one book which is not a scholastic treatise ? his Historia Majoris Britanniae tam Angliae quam Scotiae . The Latin in which the History is written shows no trace of the influence of the revival of letters ; it is the Latin of the schoolmen , impure , inharmonious and difficult . On the other hand , Major as a historian stands on a far higher level than that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great research , but he carefully selects the significant facts that were accessible to him , and judges men and events , if not with philosophic grasp , yet with a genial shrewdness which gives piquancy to his narrative . In six books he relates the history of the two countries from the earliest times till the reigns of Henry VII and James 172 Reformation and Renascence in Scotland IV . What is noteworthy in his narrative is his rejection of the legendary origins of Scotland which had been invented to rcl nit the English claims of paramountcy , and which continued to be retailed by Scottish historians into the eighteenth century . But the most signal illustration of Major 's insight and originality is his attitude regarding the political relations of the two kingdoms whose histories he relates . Almost alone among his countrymen , and at a period when the hereditary animosities of England and Scotland were never more intense , he counselled political union as the natural consummation of their respective destinies and in the best interest of both peoples . One of the most notable specimens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitled The Cornplaynt of Scotland , the anonymous author of which was an adherent of the ancient church , and an ardent opponent of the English alliance . Primarily a political pamphlet , it was prompted by the miseries of the country that followed the defeat of the Scots at Pinkie by the duke of Somerset in 1547 ; and the object of its author is to point out to his countrymen the various evils to which their misfortunes were due . Till within recent years , the Complaynt was regarded as an original work , but it is now known to be , in great part , an adaptation of Le Quadrilogue Invectif of Alain Chartier ( 1422 ) . The object of Chartier 's work was to encourage his countrymen in their effort to expel the English , and , as the same situation now existed in Scotland , the author of the Complaynt found material in Chartier ready to his hand . After an introduction , consisting of an epistle to queen Mary and an epistle to the reader , the book opens with a succession of chapters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the author discourses on such themes as the " mutations of monarches , " the wrath of God against wicked peoples , and the approaching end of the world ? all with more or less direct bearing on the miseries of Scotland . In chapter vi , we have what the author calls " ane monologue recreative , " in which , with curious irrelevancy , a shepherd is made to expound the Ptolemaic system . Then follows what is to be considered the main portion of the book ? the vision of Dame Scotia and her indictment of the iniquities of nobles , clergy and commons , which have produced // the existing miseries of their country . Here , again , the author is indebted to Chartier , from whom he has appropriated the conception of the vision , besides certain portions of his text . Such is the general plan of this fantastic production , which may have been drawn from other sources not yet discovered . Regarded merely as a specimen of early Scottish prose , however , the book has an interest of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " domestic scottis language " ? a statement which he modifies by the further remark that he found it necessary " til myxt oure langage vitht part of termis dreuyn derived fra Lateen . " Another source of interest in the book is the multitude of curious details regarding the life of the time which are not to be found elsewhere . Of its author nothing is known , though he has been variously identified with Sir James Inglis , abbot of Cambuskenneth , Sir James Inglis , abbot of Culross , Sir David Lyndsay and one of the three Wedderburns . From the book itself , we gather that he was a Catholic and an enemy of England ; and the recent discovery that he had read a manuscript of Octavien St. Gelais , bishop of Angouleme , suggests that he may have been in the suite of queen Mary in France , and strengthens the conjecture that the work was printed in Paris in 1548 or 1549 . A notable volume was archbishop Hamilton 's Catechism ( 1552 ) , so called because it was issued by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Written in the purest Scots of the time , the Catechism presents the fundamental Catholic doctrines in the simplest and most attractive form , though in the tumultuous period that followed its publication it had little influence in furthering the cause of its promoters . The most eminent defender of the old church was Quintin Kennedy , a son of the second earl of Cassillis , who , in 1558 , published The Compendius Tractive , which stated the ease against protestantism with such persuasiveness and ability that , by the admission of an opponent , it perceptibly affected the progress of the new opinions . Better known than his Tractive , however , is the Ressoning between him and Knox : the record of an oral controversy that took place at Maybole in 1562 , and lasted for three days . A larger amount of work was produced by Ninian Winzet , another Catholic controversialist , who , in his Certain Tractatis 174 Reformation and Renascence in Scotland for Reformatioun of Doctryne and Manneris ( 1562 ) , frankly admitted the corruptions of the Catholic church in Scotland , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national religion . It is noteworthy in Winzet and other Roman Catholic writers of the time that they claimed to be the upholders of the national tradition not only in religion but in policy . In the alliance with England , but for whose intervention the reformation in Scotland would not have been accomplished , they saw the ruin of their country ; and all things English were the objects of their special detestation . For this reason it was that they resented the intrusion of English words into the Scottish vocabulary , and regarded it as a patriotic duty to write in what they considered the purest Scots . In a well known sentence , Winzet caustically upbraids Knox ( who , in point of fact , wrote for England as well as for Scotland ) for his use of English modes of expression . " Gif you , " he writes , " throw curiositie of novations has forget our auld plane Scottis quhilk your mother merit you : in tymes cuming I sail write to you my mynd in Latin ; for I am not acquynted with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the period undoubtedly belongs to John Leslie , bishop of Ross , the friend , adviser and most distinguished champion of Mary , whom he attended during her imprisonment in England . Like many others of his Scottish contemporaries , Leslie chose history as his special province , and , like all the historians and chroniclers who have already been mentioned , he chose as his theme the history of his own country . His first work , written during his residence in England , took up the national history from the death of James I , where Hector Boece had stopped , and continued it to the year 1561 . This fragment , composed in the vernacular , was followed up by a more ambitious performance in Latin ( De Origine , Mori bus et Rebus Scotorum ) , published at Rome in 1578 , in which he narrated the national history from its origins . In 1596 , this was translated into Scots by Father James Dalrymple , a Scottish monk at Ratisbon , but the manuscript was not published till 1888 . The first seven books of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boece , and he is as credulous as Boece himself regarding freaks of nature and his country 's legends . In the later portions of // his work , however , he writes with seriousness and moderation , and his narrative of events during the reign of Mary is one of the valuable sources for the period . Writing as a dignitary of the church , he has his own point of view ; but his natural equability of temper saved him from the explosions of Knox , while his mediocre gifts rendered his work commonplace compared with that of his great rival . The works that have been enumerated belong , for the most part , to the main stream of the reformation literature , which may be regarded as the distinctive product of the period . Parallel with this main stream , however , there was another class of writings which , in greater or less degree , and more or less directly , proceeded from the secular movement of the renascence . It is a noteworthy fact in the history of Scotland from the earliest Middle Ages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence of every new development in western Christendom . Especially since the war of independence against England , which had thrown her into the arms of France , her intercourse with the continent had been close and continuous . From the middle of the fourteenth century , there had been a constant stream of Scottish students to the university of Paris and to other universities of France , with the result that every novelty in the spheres of thought or action speedily found its way into Scotland . It was to be expected , therefore , that the revival of learning would not leave Scotsmen untouched , and in one distinguished Scot its influence is manifest . This was Hector Boece , a native of Dundee , and subsequently the first principal of the newly founded university of Aberdeen . Boece was a member of the university of Paris ( luring the greater part of the last two decades of the fifteenth century , and was the esteemed fellow student and friend of Erasmus ? a fact which , in itself , suggests that Bocce 's sympathies were with the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two published works , his Vitae Episcoporum Murthlacensium et Aberdonensium ( 1522 ) , and his Historia Gentis Scotorum ( 1527 ) , show conclusively that he had studied the classical writers in the new spirit . While his contemporary , John Major , who also studied at Paris , wrote his History of Greater Britain in the traditional style of the medieval chroniclers , Boece deliberately made Livy his model and endeavoured 1 76 Reformation and Renascence in Scotland to reproduce his manner and method . His sole concern , indeed , was to present his subject in the most attractive form of which it was capable , and his one aim to prove to the world that Scotland and her people had a history which surpassed that of every other country in point of interest and antiquity . His name is now a byword for the inventive chronicler ; but he was not so regarded by his contemporaries , and , even so late as the eighteenth century , his astounding narrative of fabulous kings and natural wonders was seriously accepted by the majority of his countrymen . Translated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Boece found wide currency on the continent , and in France , to the present day , many prevalent impressions , of Scotland are traceable to his lively fancy . In England , Boece had still greater good fortune ; his tale of Macbeth and Duncan , taken from him by Holinshed , supplied Shakespeare with the plot of his great tragedy , as well as with those vivid touches of local colour which abound in the play . But Boece 's History is memorable for another reason besides its wide currency and its audacious fictions : it gave occasion to the first book in Scottish prose which has come down to us . At the instance of James V , who thus followed the example of other princes of the renascence , it was translated into Scots ( 1536 ) by John Bellenden , archdeacon of Moray , one of the many versifiers who haunted the court . Bellenden proved an admirable translator ? his flowing and picturesque style doing full justice to his original , while he added so much in Boece 's own manner that he further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the command of James ? another illustration of the influence of the renascence in Scotland ? Bellenden undertook a Scottish translation of all the existing books of Livy , though only five were actually completed . Besides being a translator , Bellenden has claims as a poet on the strength of the versified prologues to his Livy and Boece 's History and other pieces , and it is specially for his skill in verse that his contemporary , Sir David Lyndsay , commends him as The cunnying clark , quhilk writith craftelie , The plant of poetis , call it Ballendyne , Quhosc ornat warkis my wit can nocht defyne. // In the works of Bocce and Bellenden , the influence of the revival of learning is distinctly apparent , but it is in George Buchanan that Scotland has its pre-eminent representative of the movement known as humanism . By his contemporaries , both in England and on the continent , Buchanan 's mastery of Latin , equally in prose and verse , was acknowledged with emphatic unanimity . Poetarum nostri saeculi facile princeps ? so he was described by Henri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was generally regarded as just by the scholars of every country . And for fully two centuries after his death his fame suffered little diminution . In the seventeenth century , Saumaise speaks of him as " the greatest man of his age , " and Grotius calls him Scotiae illud numen . As a writer of history , Dryden declared that Buchanan was " comparable to any of the moderns and excelled by few of the ancients . " In the eighteenth century , according to Warton , he was still " a popular modern classic , " and Dr. Johnson , not a genial critic of Scotsmen in general , conceded that " Buchanan not only had great knowledge of the Latin , but was a great poetical genius . " As pre-eminently , therefore , as Knox represents the reformation in Scotland , Buchanan represents the revival of letters . Born in 15o6 or 1507 , at Killearn in Stirlingshire , Buchanan was sent in his fifteenth year to the university of Paris , where , during two years , he was assiduously trained in the composition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lectures of John Major in the university of St. Andrews , whom , in the true spirit of humanism , he describes as " teaching the art of sophistry rather than dialectics . " A second sojourn in Paris ( 1525-35 ? ) , extending to about ten years , decided his future career ; thenceforward , his life was to be that of the typical scholar of the renascence ? a life devoted to the study of the classical writers and the interpretation of them to his contemporaries as a consecrated vocation . It was Buchanan 's lifelong conviction , which he shared with most scholars of his time , that Latin must eventually become the literary language of Christendom , and that it would be disastrous to literature should it prove otherwise . What his new reading of the Bible was to Knox , Pura oratio , the language of Cicero or of Vergil was to Buchanan . 178 Reformation and Renascence in Scotland With few exceptions , the writings of Buchanan were prompted by some immediate occasion of the moment . As far as we know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to throw off those shorter poems mainly directed against idle and dissolute monks and priests , or against opponents of the new studies which had resulted from the revival of learning . At this period , the struggle between the champions of the old and the new studies was at its height in the schools of Paris , and it was in the teeth of the most vehement opposition on the part of the university that Francis I , in 1530 , founded the College Royal for the study of Greek , Latin and Hebrew . With all the energy of his ardent temper , Buchanan threw himself on the side of the reformers . In caustic epigrams he denounced the obscurantism of those who opposed the study of the classical writers as these were now interpreted through the labours of the Italian humanists . But his most effectual contribution to the cause of the new studies at this time was his translation into Latin of Linacre 's Grammar , published in Paris in 1533 , which ran through seven editions before the close of the century . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cassillis , he takes the opportunity of stating the reasons for its publication , and his words deserve to be quoted as illustrating the ideals to which his life was dedicated and as clearly defining the position of the adversaries with whom he waged a lifelong battle . " But I am perfectly aware , " he says , " that in translating this book many will think that I have given myself quite unnecessary trouble . We have already too many of such books , these persons will say , and , moreover , they add , can anything be said worth the saying which is not to be found in authors who have long enjoyed the approval of the schools ? As for the novelties which make a large portion of this book , such as the remarks on the declensions of nouns , of relatives , and certain moods and tenses of verbs , they think them mere useless trifling . Such criticism can only come of sheer ignorance or the blindest prejudice , that will listen only to its own suggestions , and gravely maintains that departure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proof not so much of foolish self-confidence as of actual impiety . From these persons , so wise in their own conceit , I appeal to all men of real learning and sincere love of letters , confident that to all such Linacre will generally commend himself . " // To the same period of his second residence in Paris belongs . f poem , the first in his Book of Elegies , which calls for special mention as a valuable historical document of the time . The poem is entitled , Quam misera sit conditio docentium literas humaniores Lutetiae . In vivid terms it describes the round ) f the daily duties of a regent in a Paris college , the squalid conditions of the class-rooms , the behaviour of the pupils , the insubordination of the chance corners ( errones , galoches ) who are permitted to attend the lessons and the grumbling of parents " that their sons learn nothing and that fees must till be paid . " Another migration in Buchanan 's wandering career gave rise to three poems which had a determining influence on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he returned to Scotland with his pupil , the earl of Cassillis , and , during his residence the country with that nobleman , he translated into Latin verse a pasquinade of Dunbar , How Dumbar wes desyrd to be one freir , but which Buchanan entitled simply Somnium . In this poem , a pungent attack on the Franciscan order , St. Francis , its founder , appears in a dream , and beseeches him to don the habit . The reply of the poet is that he can be an lionester man as he is , though , if St. Francis could promise him a bishopric , he would gladly listen to his proposals . It was Buchanan 's first declaration of war against the great order the worst enemies , as he considered them , of reform in religion and learning . His engagement with Cassillis having expired , Buchanan was on the point of returning to France , when an offer came to him from James V to become tutor to the lord James Stewart , one of James 's natural sons , not to be confounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regent Moray . Like his immediate predecessors , James was a patron of poets , and took pleasure in their effusions . As James 's public policy showed , he was a true sl m of the church , but he happened to have a personal grudge against the Franciscans , and he charged Buchanan to sharpen his pen against the order . Against his own inclination , for , by his previous satire , he had already provoked that formidable tidy , he wrote the piece entitled Palinodia , in which , according to his own account , he sought to express himself with such nibiguity as at once to satisfy the king and not to give further Igo Reformation and Renascence in Scotland offence to the Franciscans . In point of fact , the satire is a more deadly attack than the Somnium on the vices and obscurantism of the order . But even this scathing satire did not satisfy James , and he demanded another " which should not only prick the skin , but probe the vitals . " The result was Franciscanus , the longest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charges that were then generally brought against that body , their contempt of their own rules , their rapacity , their frauds on the public ? are here set forth with a far keener purpose to wound than appears in the contemporary satire of Lyndsay . The poem was not completed at this time , and it was not till Buchanan 's final return to Scotland , in 156o , that he put the finishing touches to it , and published it with a dedication to the regent Moray . Though it was not now printed , however , the Franciscans were aware of its existence , and not even the authority of the king could secure him from their vengeance . Supported by cardinal Beaton , the most powerful churchman in the country , they accused him of heretical opinions , and James was constrained to commit him to prison , from which , however , by James 's own connivance , he escaped across the Border into England . Arrived in London , Buchanan , according to his own account , found Henry VIII " burning Protestant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same fire , " though , in a poem addressed to Henry at this time , he ascribes to him all the virtues of an Alfred or a St. Louis . In another set of verses , accompanied with a collection of his poems , he sought to commend himself to Henry 's minister , Thomas Cromwell , then all powerful , and gives a pitiful account of his own fortunes as one Qui vagus , exul , mops , terra jactatur et unda Per mala quae fallax omnia mundus habet . As Cromwell made no response to his appeal , and as England was hardly a safe place for one of his opinions , under the pretence of proceeding to Germany he took ship for France , but only to find his arch enemy Beaton in Paris . An invitation to become a professor in the newly founded College de Guyenne at Bordeaux relieved him from immediate want and danger , and there , for the next three years , we find him as one of the precepteurs domestiques attached to the college . ExBuchanan 's Latin Plays 18i pressly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already gained the repute of being the best of its kind in France , and among other pupils attracted to it was Montaigne , who himself tells us that he had Buchanan " ce grand pocte escossois " as one of his precepteurs dc chambre . Now in surroundings that were congenial to him , and in association with colleagues of tastes kindred to his own , Buchanan was stimulated to productions on a more ambitious scale than anything he had hitherto attempted . As his poetic gifts and his command of Latin were regarded as unrivalled , to him was entrusted the task of being the spokesman if the college on all public occasions . When the emperor Charles V passed through Bordeaux on his memorable visit to Francis I , it was Buchanan who was commissioned to hail the illustrious guest in a congratulatory ode ? a task which he brilliantly accomplished in one of his Sylvae ? Ad Carolum V Imperatorem , Burdegalae hospitio publico susceptum , nomine Scholae Burdegalensis . By a rule of the college , each professor was expected to compose a Latin play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his charge , and , in the performance of this duty , Buchanan produced four plays during his residence in Bordeaux . Two of these were translations of the Medea and Alcestis of Euripides , primarily undertaken , Buchanan himself tells us , to improve his scholarship in Greek , for in Greek , it is significant , Buchanan was self-taught . The other two plays , Jephthes and Baptistes , are original compositions , modelled on the classical examples , and expressly written to enforce that pietas literata which was the ideal of all the schools that , like the College de Guyenne , had recently been founded in France . In Buchanan 's judgment , the former , founded on the story of Jephthah 's vow , is the better drama , and in none of his productions has he risen to a higher strain of moral intensity find elevation of thought and expression . It is in the Baptistes , however , that we find the fullest and hardiest expression of the convictions which , frequently at his own peril , he consistently proclaimed throughout his whole career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fiery apostle of precisely those doctrines of political and religious liberty which ere then perturbing Christendom , and his death at the hands 1$2 Reformation and Renascence in Scotland of Herod is pointed as the moral of all religious and political tyranny . Buchanan must have known that it was at his own risk that he expressed these opinions in such a city as Bordeaux where heresy had , indeed , lately appeared , and where , about the date of the appearance of Baptistes , a heretic had actually been burned . It was doubtless , therefore , for reasons connected with his personal safety , that he left Bordeaux in 1542 ? 3 , between which date and 1547 we all but lose sight of him . To this period , however , belongs a poem which deserves special attention as being the most minutely personal of his productions and as illustrating what is notable throughout his life ? the affection and regard in which he was held by the most distinguished scholars of the time . The poem , entitled Ad Ptolemaeum Luxium Tastaeum et Jacobum Taevium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , where he had lain for a year between life and death , and its burden is that his sufferings had been made light by the tender attention of friends , whose names and special services he enumerates in glowing remembrance . In 1547 , Buchanan received an invitation which was to lead to the most eventful experience in his chequered career and to the production of the most memorable of all his works . The invitation was to join a band of scholars , intended to complete the staff of teachers in the university of Coimbra in Portugal , which had been remodelled by king John III . Buchanan accepted the offer , but , within a year , the Jesuits , then supreme in Portugal , obtained control over the university , and Buchanan and others were accused of heresy and conveyed to the Inquisition in Lisbon . During a year and a half , Buchanan was repeatedly under examination by the inquisitors , mainly on the charge of eating meat in Lent and of satirising the Franciscans . Convinced at length that , though he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heretic , they allowed him his liberty , but on the condition that he should spend six months in a neighbouring monastery in some penitential exercise . The penance which he chose , or which was imposed upon him , was his Psalmorum Davidis Para phrasis Poctica ? the work which more than any other has secured to him his eminent place among modern Latin // poets . Buchanan 's translation of the Psalms may fairly be considered one of the representative books of the sixteenth century , expressing , as it does , in consummate form , the conjunction of piety and learning which was the ideal of the best type of humanist . Versified translations of the Psalms were the favourite exercise of the scholars of every country , but , by general consent , Buchanan was acknowledged to have surpassed all competitors in the felicity of his rendering , and it was on the title-page of their editions of his translation that Henri and Robert Estienne assigned him the distinction above referred to , of being poctarum nostri saeculi facile princeps . As a manual at once of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Buchanan 's own lifetime it was introduced into the schools of Germany and an edition , set to music , was published in 1595 ? Till within recent years , it was read in every school in Scotland where Latin was taught , and among educated Scotsmen of every shade of opinion it became their treasured companion , to which they had recourse for religious edification and solace . On the expiry of his time of penance in the monastery , Buchanan was at liberty to leave Portugal , and his first thought was to seek a home in England , now a protestant country under the rule of Edward VI . The distracted state of England , however , as he tells us , offered little prospect of peaceful employment to scholars , and , once more , he sought a haven in France his second home , as he always considered it . In one of his most beautiful poems , Adventus in Galliam , he expresses his delight on finding himself again on its hospitable soil . " Buchanan , " says de Thou , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country of the Lennox , but he was of us by adoption , " and , in the glowing tributes he pays in these lines to the French and their country , Buchanan fully justified the statement . To the same period , also , belong his odes on the capture of Calais from the English and of Metz from Germany , in which he speaks with all the fervour ; Ind pride of a Frenchman in his country 's triumph . In 1555 , Buchanan had been appointed tutor to Timoleon du Cosse , son of Charles du Cosse , corn-Le de Brissac , one of the marshals of France , and the connection gave occasion to the most elaborate of all his poems the poem entitled De Sphaera . All 184 Reformation and Renascence in Scotland Buchanan 's more serious productions are informed by a strenuous didactic purpose , and it was primarily for the instruction of his pupil that De Sphaera was undertaken . Its theme is the exposition of the Ptolemaic cosmogony in opposition to the system which had recently been promulgated by Copernicus , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unlearned as impious and irrational . The poem was intended as its author 's greatest stroke for durable fame , and in its execution he has lavished all his learning and all the poetic art at his command . As we have it , it consists of five books , the last two of which are unfinished ; and it remains as a curious memorial of a literary ambition which strangely mistook the course of the world 's thought , equally regarding its theme and the language in which it is written . Towards the year 156o , there came a change in Buchanan 's opinions which divides his life in twain . Hitherto , though he had spoken freely of monks and priests , he had remained a member of the church of Rome , but , from a special study of the Bible , as he tells us , he now became convinced that the truth was to be found in protestant teaching . As Scotland adopted protestantism as its national religion in r56o , after an exile of more than twenty years he returned to his native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prompted him to renewed production . During the first six years after his return to Scotland , it was queen Mary who was the chief inspirer of his muse . Before he left France , he had already celebrated her marriage with Francis I in an Epithalamium containing the famous description of his countrymen beginning Illa pharetratis est propria gloria Scotis , which are among the best known lines he has written . To Mary , also , he now dedicated the second edition of his translation of the Psalms in the most admired of all his shorter poems , the epigram beginning Nympha , Caledoniae quae nunc feliciter orae Missa per innumeros sceptra tueris avos . Till 1567 , he remained in close connection with the court , reading the classics with Mary in her leisure hours , composing // masque on the occasion of her marriage with Darnley , and celebrating the birth of her son , afterwards James VI , in a Genethliacon in which he did not conceal his opinions regarding the duties of rulers to their subjects . The murder of Darnley , the head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converted him into a bitter enemy of Mary , as , like all protestants , he believed that she was accessory to the crime . Henceforward , therefore , he identified himself with the political and religious party which drove her from the throne , and it was in the interests of that party that his subsequent writings were mainly produced . In his Detectio , written at the request of the protestant lords , he has presented their case against Mary with a vehemence of statement which can only be understood and justified by comparison with the polemical writings of contemporary scholars . In the service of the same cause , he produced the only two pieces which he wrote in vernacular Scots Chamaeleon , a satire on Maitland of Lethington , and the Admonition to the trees Lordis , a warning to the protestant lords themselves regarding their past and future policy . What is noteworthy in these two pamphlets is that Buchanan shows the same mastery of the Scottish language as he does of Latin , and their periodic sentences are an exact reproduction of his Latin models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his Rerum Scoticarum Historia , published in 1582 , the year of his death , in which he related the history of Scotland from its origin till the death of the regent Lennox in 1571 . Dedicated to James VI , with whose education he had been entrusted , the underlying object of the book is the inculcation of those principles of political and religious liberty of which Buchanan had been the consistent champion throughout his career . By the leading scholars of Europe it was adjudged to be a work of transcendent merit , and even in the eighteenth century it was seriously debated whether Caesar , Livy , or Sallust had hem his model . In this History , which for fully two centuries kept its place as a standard authority , Buchanan had appealed both to scholars and protestant theologians , and in another work , De Jure Regni apud Scotos ( 1579 ) , he made a still wider appeal on questions which were then agitating every country in Christendom . Written in the form of a dialogue ( between 186 Reformation and Renascence in Scotland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an apology for the Scottish reformation , and , as a classic exposition of protestant political theory , it found wide acceptance both in Britain and on the continent Dryden in the following century even accusing Milton of having embodied it in his Defence of the People of England . " No man , " says archbishop Spottiswoode , " did better merit of his nation for learning , nor thereby did bring it to more glory , " and this is Buchanan 's specific and pre-eminent claim to the regard of his countrymen . Read as classics by all educated Scotsmen , his works , prose and verse , perpetuated the study of Latin , which , to the comparative neglect of Greek , remained a rooted tradition in the curriculum of a learned education in Scotland . Scotland , as has already been said , owing to conditions peculiar to itself , was more powerfully affected by the reformation than by the renascence , yet , through the work of Buchanan , and of others of kindred tastes , though less distinguished than himself , one result , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has ever been associated with learning in the mind of the Scottish people . CHAPTER VIII The New English Poetry T HE reign of Henry VIII was not , as students of history know , a period of unbroken internal peace . Nevertheless , when the wars of the Roses were over and a feeling of security had been induced by the establishment of a strong dynasty , a social and intellectual life became possible in England which the troubles of the reigns of Henry VIII and his two successors were sufficient to check but not to destroy . More important still , England , having more or less settled her internal troubles by a judicious application of the balancing system , became a power to be reckoned with in European politics . This brought her into touch with the kingdoms of the continent , and so , for the first time in a more than incidental way , submitted her intellectual life to the influences of the renascence . The inspiration of the new poetry , we shall find , was almost entirely foreign . It was upon French , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtiers of Henry V III founded the poems which now began to be written in large numbers . The extent to which the practice of versifying prevailed can not now be gauged ; but modern investigation shows it to have been very wide . To make poems was one of the recognised accomplishments of the knight as conceived in the last phase of chivalry , the days with which we are , for the moment , concerned ; and it is not , perhaps , too much to ay that every educated man made poems , which , if approved , Were copied out by his friends and circulated in manuscript , be included in song-books . It was not , however , till 1557 that some few were , for the first time , put into print by Richard Tottel , in the volume , Songs and Sonettes , written by the 187 // ryght honorable Lorde Henry Haward late Earle of Surrey , and other , commonly known as Tottel 's Miscellany . This volume tends to prove that the movement had one pioneer and two leaders . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leadership by Henry Howard , known as earl of Surrey . A sketch of their lives , especially of that of the former , may be of interest as helping to show the extent to which England was brought into touch with European influences . Thomas Wyatt was born in or about 1503 , and was edu - cated at Cambridge , possibly , also , at Oxford . In 1511 , his father was joint constable with Sir Thomas Boleyn of Norwich Castle , and , as a boy , he made the acquaintance of a lady Sir Thomas 's daughter Anne with whose name report was to link his own very closely . In 1525 , after holding certain offices about the person of the king , Thomas Wyatt accompanied Sir Thomas Cheney on a diplomatic mission to France . In 1526-7 , he was sent with Sir John Russell , the English ambassador , to the papal court ; and visited Venice , Ferrara , Bologna and Florence . On his return , he was captured by the imperial forces under the constable of Bourbon , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calais . In 1537 , he went as ambassador to the emperor , and remained abroad , mainly in Spain , till 1539 ; in the April of that year he was recalled , in consequence of the intrigues of his fellowambassador , Bonner . At the end of the same year he was despatched to Flanders to see the emperor and followed him to Paris , returning in 1j40 . On the fall of Cromwell , who had supported Wyatt , Bonner succeeded in obtaining Wyatt 's imprisonment in the Tower ; whence , having either denied the accusation or pleaded for mercy , he was afterwards released . He retired to his house at Allington , in Kent , and employed his leisure in writing his satires and his paraphrase of the penitential psalms . In 1542 , we find him knight of the shire for Kent ; and , in the summer of that year , hastening in ill health on a mission to conduct the imperial ambassador to London , he caught a fever , and died on the road , at Sherborne , on 11 October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned . He was commonly regarded as , in youth , the lover of Anne Boleyn ; and it was reported that , when the // king wished to make that lady his wife , Wyatt informed him of his previous relations with her . Whatever the truth of an obscure matter , Wyatt was chief ewer at the coronation of Henry 's second queen in 1533 ; and , though we find him committed to the Tower in May , 1536 , the period of her downfall , it was probably only as a witness . One of his sonnets , Whoso fist to hunt , has clear reference to Anne Boleyn , ending , as it does , with the line : " Noli me tangere ; for Caesar 's I am " ; I or , though it is imitated from Romanello i or Petrarch ( 157 , Una candida cerva ) , it may yet be of personal application . There is also an epigram Of His Love called Anna , and another reference to Anne has been found by some in the sonnet Though I myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1536 , was , undoubtedly , one of the facts in his life which induced him to regard May as his unlucky month . a It will be seen that Wyatt frequently travelled abroad , and that he spent a period of some months in Italy . And it was from Italy that he drew the ideas and the form by means of which English poetry was rejuvenated . The changes which English versification passed through in the period between Chaucer and the Elizabethans are described elsewhere.3 Neither the principles of rhythm and accent , it would seem , not even the grammar of Chaucer were fully understood by his followers , Lydgate , Occleve and Hawes . In place of Chaucer 's care in arranging the stress and pause of his line , here is chaotic carelessness ; and the diction is redundant , feeble and awkward . Meanwhile , the articulate final -e , of which Chaucer made cunning use , had been dropping out of common speech , and the accent on the final syllable of words derived from the French , such as favour , virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first syllable , with the result of producing still further prosodical confusion and irregularity . I t was the mission of Wyatt and his junior contemporary , Surrey , to substitute order for confusion , especially by means of the Italian influence which they brought to bear on English poetry , an influence afterwards united by Spenser ( Gabriel Harvey assisting ) with the classical influence . // Wyatt 's chief instrument was the sonnet , a form which he was the first English writer to use . Of all forms , the sonnet is that in which it is most difficult to be obscure , turgid , or irregular . Its small size and precise structure force on the writer compression , point and intensity , for a feeble sonnet proclaims itself feeble at a glance . No better corrective could have been found for vague thought , loose expression and irregular metre ; and the introduction of the sonnet stands as the head and front of Wyatt 's benefaction to English poetry . His model ? in thought , and , up to a certain point , in form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a close student . Wyatt 's sonnets number about thirty : ten of them are translations of Petrarch , and two others show a debt to the same author . But either he did not apprehend , or he deliberately decided not to imitate , the strict Petrarchian form ; and the great majority of the English sonneteers before Milton followed his example . The main difference is this : that , whereas the sextet of the strict Petrarchian sonnet never ends with a couplet , the sonnets of Sir Thomas Wyatt , and Elizabethan sonnets in general , nearly always do . The effect produced , that of a forcible ending , is opposed to the strict principles of the sonnet , which should rise to its fullest height at the conclusion of the octave , to sink to rest gradually in the sextet . But the final couplet has been used so freely and to such noble ends by English writers that objection is out of place . Wyatt was possibly induced to adopt this form partly by the existence of the favourite Chaucerian rime royal stanza of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two or three ( e.g. Was never file ; Some fowles there be ; How oft have I ) do actually , by their sense , fall into two divisions of seven lines ; but it is plain that this was not the principle on which he constructed his sonnets . For the most part , the separation of octave and sextet is clearly marked , and the rimes of the former are arranged in Petrarchian fashion , abbaabba , with occasional variations , of which abbaacca is a not uncommon form . The effect of the sonnet-form on Wyatt 's thought and diction we shall examine presently ; for the moment , we are concerned with his metrical reforms . He was a pioneer , and perfection was not to be expected of him . He has been described as a man stumbling over obstacles , // continually falling but always pressing forward . Perhaps the best way of illustrating his merits and his shortcomings is to quote one of his sonnets in full ; and it will be convenient for the purpose to take his version of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to compare later the advance made by the younger writer . The longe love , that in my thought I barber , And in my hart cloth kepe his residence , Into my face preaseth with bold pretence , And there campeth , displaying his banner . She that me learns to love , and to suffer , And wines that my trust , and lustes negligence Be reined by reason , shame , and reverence , With his hardinesse , takes displeasure . Wherwith love to the hartes forest he fleeth , Leavyng his enterprise with paine and crye , And there him hideth and not appeareth . What may I do ? when my maister feareth , But in the field with him to live and dye , For good is the life , endyng faithfully . The author of this sonnet clearly has much to learn . The scanning of barber , banner , suffer , campeth , preaseth , forest as iambics is comprehensible ; but , in line 6 , we have to choose between a heavy stress on the unimportant word my , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in line 8 , we can hardly escape hardinesse , and must have either takes again , or disple-a-sure ( a possibility which receives some very doubtful support from line 8 of the sonnet , Love , Fortune , and my minde , in the almost certainly corrupt version in the first edition of Tottel 's Miscellany ) . in lines 1 r and 12 , we find the curious fact that appeareth is rimed with feareth , not on the double rime but on the last syllable only ; while the last line throws a heavy emphasis on the . The author , in fact , seems to have mastered the necessity of having ten syllables in a decasyllabic line , but to be very uncertain still in questions of accent and rhythm . Some of the lines irresistibly suggest a man counting the syllables on his fingers , as , indeed , the reader is often compelled to do on a first acquaintance ; on the other hand , we find a beautiful line like the tenth , which proves the author however unskilled as yet , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New English Poetry is feeble and often pointless , and the total impression is that of a man struggling with difficulties too great for him . But it is fair to remember two things : first , that pronunciation was then in a state of flux ( in one of his satires we find Wyatt scanning honour as an iambic and as a trochee in the same line ) ; secondly , that he made great advance in technique , and that some of the ruggedness of his work ( not including this sonnet ) , as it appears in the first edition of Tottel 's Miscellany , is due to a faulty text , partly corrected in the second edition . Nott , who published the original MS. in 1816 , discovered that Wyatt had occasionally marked the caesura with his own hand , and sometimes indicated the mode of disposing of a redundant syllable . There are sonnets ( for instance , Unstable dream ) which run perfectly smoothly ? to say no more showing that mastery came with practice , and that errors were not due to want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the introduction of the sonnet with its chastening and strengthening influence on metre and diction ? is Wyatt 's great service to English poetry ; but his service did not end there . His close study of Petrarch and other Italian authors resulted in an innovation quite as important , the introduction of the personal note . The conventionality of character , sentiment and machinery inherited from the Roman de la Rose disappeared ; and , in its place , came poetry professedly and intentionally personal , and , within limits , actually introspective . Following Petrarch , Wyatt sang , in his love-poetry , almost exclusively of his own sufferings at the cruelty , much more rarely of his own joy in the kindness , of his mistress . To say that many of the sonnets are translations and , therefore , can not represent the actual feelings of the translator , is to question the sincerity of almost every Elizabethan sonneteer . The pleasures and pains of love are the same in all ages ; it is the convention of expression which changes . The new convention , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a convention of personal emotion , in which the poet at least pretends to be singing of his own heart . And in Wyatt we meet with constant proof that he is so singing . In imitating Petrarch , he frequently adopted to the full the Petrarchian scheme for the content of a sonnet the selection of an image which is then elaborated with as many cognate and subsidiary // metaphors as may be . Take , for instance , Wyatt 's sonnet My galley charged with forgetfulnesse , which is copied from Petrarch 's Passa la nave mia colma d'obblio . His heart is a ship , steered cruelly through a winter sea by his foe , who is his lord ; the oars are thoughts ; the winds are sighs and fearfulness ; the rain is tears ; the clouds are disdain ; the cords are twisted with error and ignorance ; while reason , that should lie his consort ( or comfort ) , is drowned . If there were nothing of superior matter to this in Wyatt , his achievement would almost be limited to his metrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are shown in other sonnets in which he either alters his original , modifying some more than usually strained conceit into something in better taste , or writes with no original but his own heart . See the close of his sonnet , Lyke unto these unmesurable mountaines , imitated from Melin de St. Gelays , or lines 5 ? 8 in his sonnet , Yet was never of your love agreved , in which he flatly contradicts the sentiment of Petrarch . And , more than once , he flies in the face of the slavery to the mistress prescribed in the code of chivalric love from which he drew much of his inspiration ; declaring roundly ( e.g. in the sonnet , My love to skorn ) that , As there is a certayn time to rage : So is there time such madnes to aswage ; and bids his cruel mistress a manly farewell . It is not fanciful , perhaps , to find such a sentiment characteristically English . The chivalric ideal , codified in Castiglione 's Il Cortegiano , was , as we shall see further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last century of chivalry in England ; but there is , perhaps , something in our temperament that forbade its complete acceptance in the matter of the servitude of love . The same sentiment appears even more clearly in Wyatt 's lyrics not in sonnet form and especially in those composed of short lines . A delightful song in three quatrains of octosyllabic lines , Madame , withouten many wordes , is as brave and cavalier n way of demanding a " yes " or " no " as Suckling himself could have uttered ; and What should I say ! Since Faith is dead , it little song of tetrasyllabic lines with a refrain , is a resolute if graceful farewell . It is in these lighter lyrics that some of // Wyatt 's finest work is to be found . Forget not yet the tried intent is known to all readers of poetry . It is marked , with other poems , by two things : the use of the refrain and the unmistakable impression it conveys of having been written to be sung . The refrain is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wyatt almost as much as the practice of the short poem ? in a metre imitated , as a rule , from Italian or French ? towards being clear , exact and musical . Of the influence of music on the writing of poetry more will be said elsewhere . It would be rash to state that in the reign of Henry VIII music so far followed the rhythm of poetry as to exert a good influence on its form . Still , a lyric was , in those days , written , as a matter of course , to be sung , and when poems sing themselves it may be safe to give to music a share in the good work . We do not find in Wyatt the elaborate metrical harmonies that grew up in Elizabeth 's clays . His stanzas are always short , and simple in construction , without much involution of rime , and they have a sweetness , a dignity and a sincerity that make them strongly attractive . But their place in the history of English poetry is more important than their intrinsic qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberately studied and worked upon by the poetic imagination that cry of the heart , which , beginning with the recognised pains of the chivalric lover , became the subject , in a thousand moods and forms , of what may not unfairly be considered the finest achievement of English poetry . Besides sonnets and other lyrics , Wyatt 's work falls under three heads : epigrams , satires and devotional pieces . Epigram means , with Wyatt , not a stinging stave of wit , but a single conceit or paradox vividly expressed ? for instance : The lover cornpareth his hart to the over-charged gonne ( which may be specially noticed because a later use of the same idea will help to show the deterioration of the school of Wyatt ) ; Comparison of love to a streame falling from the Alpes ; How by a kisse he found both his life and death ; and so forth . The epigrams , indeed , differ little in matter from the more metaphysical of the sonnets ; though , here and there , we find the form used for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being in prison , to Brian ( written , probably , during his incarceration in 1540 , to his friend Sir Francis Bryan , also a poet ) , and in Wyatt 's Satires ' 95 The Lover professeth himself constant . For the matter of a few of the epigrams , and for the construction of all , Wyatt 's model is the Strambotti of Serafino ; the form throughout is a decasyllabic octave riming abababcc , and , for his ideas , the writer generally sought far and wide through such foreign and classical learning as he possessed . Seneca , Josephus mid Ausonius ( possibly following Plato ) are among the authors o.n whom he draws . Of greater interest , both intrinsic and technical , are his satires , which were written in his retirement tit Allington towards the close of his active and chequered life . They are three in number . The first , Of the wane and sure estate written to John Poins , tells the fable of the town and country mouse , which he adapts from Horace ( Sat . 11 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henryson 's poem The Uponlandis Mous and the Burges Mous , though that poem was not yet printed ; while the conclusion is enlarged from Persius , Sat . 111 . The second , Of the courtiers life written to John Poins , is an adaptation of a satire of Luigi Alamanni , and explains that the author , scorning the obsequiousness and deceit demanded of courtiers , finds it better to live in retirement ; the third , How to use the court and him self e therm , written to syr Fraunces Bryan , takes its general ideas from Horace 's advice to Tiresias ( Sat . 11 , v ) , and preaches ironically the doctrine , " Put money in thy purse . " The adaptations are free , and ideas are drawn from more than one author . ' Where are several references for instance , to Chaucer , and the references are , in general , modernised . Adaptations though t hey be , these satires have every mark of sincerity . The evils if court life and the blessings of honest retirement are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; no other contributor writes with such convincing fervour , such manly rectitude , as Wyatt . His personality and his strong feeling are more patent in the satires than in any other of his poems ; and their very ruggedness of form seems ? as in the later case of Donne or Marston ? to be adopted for the better expression of honest indignation . Fifty years afterwards , Hall , the author of the Virgidemiarum , believed himself to be the first English satirist , and from the fact that Wyatt 's satires were not previously imitated it is clear that he was in advance of his time . The metre adopted by Wyatt is that of Alamanni , // the terza rima , decasyllabic lines with " linked " rimes ababcbcdcded , etc . This , too , is the scheme of rime he uses in his versions of the seven penitential psalms , which were probably composed during the same period of his life as the satires . Each psalm is introduced by a fanciful narrative , modelled on Beza 's Praefatio Poetica , of the moods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very free ; the psalms , in fact , are used rather as pretexts for the expression of the poet 's own feelings than as originals for rendering anew . He is appalled by the sense of his sinfulness , fretted " to the bones " with remorse , and full of apprehensions of the Judgment . Wyatt also translated other psalms . Warton 's statement that he translated the whole Psalter is , apparently , erroneous ; and the only other surviving version is that of Psalm 37 . Enough has been said to show that Wyatt was , for his time , a well-read man in French , Italian and classical literature . He knew something , too , of Chaucer , as the frequent references to , or quotations from , his works show ; but his almost exclusive use of French and Italian models indicates that he did not study Chaucer for his versification . His poetry conveys the charm of a brave and strong spirit ; his technical faults are those of a pioneer ; but his great claim to recognition , like that of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to raise his native tongue to dignity by making it the vehicle of " polite " and courtly poetry , an effort which his model , Petrarch , had himself made in his time . For this purpose , both Wyatt and Surrey use , according to the prescription of Castiglione , the ordinary diction of their day , free from affectation of archaism and from vulgarity ; and it is rare for the modern reader to encounter unfamiliar words in their poetry . The exact relation of Surrey to Wyatt has been a matter of dispute . The accident of birth , no doubt , led to Surrey 's poems being placed before those of Wyatt in Tottel 's Miscellany , and this accident may have induced commentators to regard Surrey as the master of Wyatt , rather than to take the probably more truthful view , that each influenced the other , but that Wyatt was the pioneer . He was , at any rate , an older man than Surrey , who was born in I516 ( ? ) . Henry Howard was the eldest son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Surrey and duke of Norfolk , and himself became , by courtesy , earl of Surrey in 1524 , on his father 's succeeding to the dukedom . From a poem to which reference will be made later it seems possible that he was educated with the duke of Richmond , Henry VII 's natural son , who , later , married his sister . At any rate , he was brought up in all the virtues and practices of chivalry , which find a large place in his poems . He visited the Field of the Cloth of Gold with the duke of Richmond , possibly accompanied him thence to Paris to study and lived with him , later , at Windsor . In 1536 , the duke died , and the same year saw the execution of Surrey 's cousin , Anne Boleyn . In 1540 , we find him a leader in the tournament held at the marriage of Anne of Cleves , and , after a mission to Guisnes , he was appointed , in 1541 , steward of Cambridge university . Part of the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge of having sent a challenge ; but , being soon released on payment of a heavy fine , he began his military career by joining his father in an expedition against the Scots . The next episode in his life is difficult of explanation : he was brought before the privy council on a charge of eating meat in Lent and of breaking windows in the city with a cross-bow . His own explanation was ( cf. London ! host thou accused me ) that it was an access of protestant fervour : he regarded himself as " a figure of the Lord 's behest , " sent to warn the sinful city of her doom . In this connection , it is fair to remember that , later , he was accused of being inimical to the new religion . The obvious explanation was that the proceeding was a piece of Mohockism on the part of a ( possibly intoxicated ) man of twenty-seven . At any rate , Surrey had to suffer for the excess . He was again shut up in the Fleet , where , probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On his release , he was sent , in October , 1543 , to join the English troops then assisting the emperor in the siege of Landrecy ; and , in 1544 , he won further military honour by his defence of Boulogne . On his return , he was thrown into prison at Windsor , owing to the intrigues of his father 's enemy , Jane Seymour 's brother , the earl of Hertford ; was released , again imprisoned , and beheaded in January , 1546/7 . In his military prowess , his scholarship , his position at court , his poetry and his mastery in chivalric exercises , Surrey is al198 The New English Poetry most as perfect a knight as Sidney himself . And what strikes the reader most forcibly in the love poems which form the bulk of his work is their adherence to the code of the chivalric courts of love . There is not to be found in Surrey the independence , the manliness or the sincerity of Wyatt . In his love poems , he is an accomplished gentleman playing a graceful game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen shortly . Surrey was formally married at 16 ; but the subject of many of his poems was not his wife , but his " lady " in the chivalric sense , the mistress whose " man " he had become by a vow of fealty . Setting aside the legends that have grown up about this fair Geraldine , from their root in Nashe 's fiction , The Unfortunate Traveller ( 1594 ) , to the sober " biography " of Anthony a Wood and others , the pertinent facts that may be regarded as true are no more than these : that Elizabeth Fitz-Gerald was a daughter of the ninth earl of Kildare , and , on her father 's death in the Tower , was brought up in the household of princess Mary , becoming one of her ladies of the chamber . That she was a mere child when Surrey first began to address poems to her confirms the impression received by the candid reader : these poems , in fact , are the result , not of a sincere passion , but of the rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Surrey 's youth . Like Wyatt , he takes his ideas from Petrarch , of whose sonnets he translates four completely , while Ariosto provides another ; and his whole body of poetry contains innumerable ideas and images drawn from Petrarch , but assimilated and used in fresh settings . The frailtie and hurtfulnesse of beautie ; Vow to love faithfully howsoever he be rewarded ; Complaint that his ladie after she knew of his love kept her face alway hidden from him ; Description of Spring , who-in eche thing renewes , save one lie the lover ; Complaint of a lover , that defied love , and was by love after the more tormented ; Complaint of a diyng lover refused upon his ladies injust mistaking of his writyng ? such are the stock subjects , as they may almost be called , of the Petrarchists which Surrey reproduces . But he reproduces them in every case with an ease and finish that prove him to have mastered his material , and his graceful fancies are admirably expressed . Earlier in the chapter we quoted Wyatt 's translation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surrey 's version of the same : " Poulter 's Measure " Love that liveth , and reigneth in my thought , That built his seat within my captive brest , Clad in the armes , wherin with me he fought , Oft in my face he doth his banner rest . She , that me taught to love , and suffer payne , My doutfull hope , and eke my hote desyre , With shamefast cloke to shadowe and refraine , Her smilyng grace converteth straight to yre . And cowarde Love then to the hart apace Taketh his flight , whereas he lurkes , and plaines His purpose lost , and dare not shewe his face . For my lordes gilt thus faultlesse byde I paynes . Yet from my lorde shall not my foote remove , Swete is his death , that takes his end by love . The advance in workmanship is obvious at a glance . There is no need to count Surrey 's syllables on the fingers , and the caesuras are arranged with variety and skill . The first line contains one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak syllable ( liveth ) , and there , as in nearly all the ether cases , in the first two feet of the line . It will be noticed , however , that , whereas Wyatt was content with two rimes for his octave , in Petrarchian fashion , Surrey frankly makes up his sonnet of three quatrains and a couplet , which was the form the sonnet mainly took in the hands of his Elizabethan ollowers . Once or twice , Surrey runs the same pair of rimes right through his first twelve lines ; but gains , on the whole , ittle advantage thus . Whichever plan he follows , the result the same : that , improving on Wyatt 's efforts , he makes . f the sonnet ? what had never existed before in English poetry a single symphonic effect . It is worth noting , too , that , hough his references to Chaucer are even more frequent han Wyatt 's , Surrey polishes and refines , never leaving unaltered the archaisms which Wyatt sometimes incorporated with his own language . A favourite metre of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wyatt , too ? is one of which the student of this period may ow tired as he traces its decadence through Turbervile , Doge and others , to its brief restoration to honour in the nods of Southwell . It was of English origin , being , probably , development of the ballad quatrain , and was commonly // called " poulter 's measure , " from the dozen of eggs that varies , or varied then , between twelve and fourteen . An example will explain the name : Suche waiward waics hath love , that most part in discord Our willes do stand , whereby our hartes but seldom doe accord . Disceit is his delight , and to begile , and mock The simple hartes whom he doth strike with froward divers strok . It is , as the reader will see , the " common time " of the hymnbook ; a combination of two sixes with a fourteener ; or , as later writers preferred to have it printed , a stanza of 6686 , only the second and fourth lines riming . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accent , and because it saves rimes ; and while , in feeble hands , it can become a monotonous jog-trot , it is lyrical in quality , and has in Wyatt 's hands a strength , in Surrey 's , an elegance , and in Southwell 's , a brilliance which should redeem it from total condemnation . One of Surrey 's most delightful poems , Complaint of the absence of her lover being upon the sea , is written in this metre , in the management of which , as in that of all the others he attempts , he shows himself a born poet , with a good ear and a knowledge of the necessity of relating line to line and cadence to cadence , so that a poem may become a symphonic whole . His clearest title to fame , however , rests on his translations from the Aeneid of Vergil into blank verse . There is unrimed verse even in Chaucer ( Tale of Melibeus ) ; and the movement against rime as a piece of medieval barbarity , which was supported , later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest exponent in Milton , had already begun . Still , it is most likely that it was from Italian poetry ( possibly Molza 's translation of Vergil , ' 1541 ) that Surrey immediately drew the idea . The merits of the translation do not very much concern us ; the merit of having introduced to England the metre of Tamburlaine the Great , The Tempest , Paradise Lost and The Excursion is one that can hardly be overrated . Surrey 's own use of the metre , if a little stiff and too much inclined to make a break at the end of each line , is a wonderful achievement for his time , and a further proof of his genuine poetical ability . 1 Published under the name of cardinal Ippolito de ' Medici.
