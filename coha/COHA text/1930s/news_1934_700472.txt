txt Wasted Effort . I wanted to please Mayor LaGuardia and hoped he might see my sidewalk and pat me on the back for it . Free from the last trace of snow or ice , gutter nicely cleaned , and then as a work of supererogation a nice little bypass through the pile so that the man who brings me THE TIMES could cross the street . I was quite proud of the job . As usual , at 10 o'clock last night , a big , bad snow-plow obliterated my bypass , filled my gutter and covered more than half my sidewalk . What good did it do ' r The vehicles now have to zigzag in and out amid the piles created . They will not be removed for a week , an orderly looking block has been messed up and I ca n't get a taxi within three doors of my home . The Street Cleaning Department has a lot of nice toys to play with , but a few shovels at the crossing would do more real good . F. V. CLARK . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
