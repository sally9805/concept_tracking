A small but sternly independent preparatory school is Gunnery , which has perched in the Berkshires near Washington , Conn. since 1850 . Founded by an abolitionist named Frederick William Gunn , Gunnery still warns parents that " luxury , waste , and soft living are contrary to the spirit of the school , " although such rich boys as Robert Lessing Rosenwald of Abingdon , Pa. now go there . In its long career Gunnery has had only three headmasters . Last week it was handed over by retiring William Hamilton Gibson to a fourth educator who can well preserve its austere tradition : Rev. Tertius van Dyke , Headmaster Gibson 's brother-in-law , the pastor of Washington 's Congregational Church , son of Princeton 's late beloved little literary patriarch , Dr. Henry van Dyke . <P> In leaving the church for Gunnery , Headmaster van Dyke at 50 is doing what his famed father did at almost the same age , when he resigned his Manhattan pastorate to teach English at Princeton . Tertius van Dyke was in one of his father 's classes there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Woodrow Wilson appointed the author of Fisherman 's Luck U. S. Minister to The Netherlands and Luxembourg . The son grew a mustache as flowing as the father 's , later collaborated with him on a syndicated newspaper column , accompanied him on innumerable trout fishing expeditions , wrote his biography when he died ( TIME , Nov. 25 , 1935 ) . Tertius van Dyke moved from Manhattan 's Park Avenue Presbyterian Church to quiet Washington after his marriage , in 1924 , to Mary Elizabeth Cannon . In Washington the van Dykes have reared a girl and two boys . When Headmaster Gibson last year asked Tertius van Dyke to take over Gunnery while he went on a vacation , Brother-in-law van Dyke shouldered his duties ably . Upon deciding last week to become a schoolmaster for good , he remarked : " I desire to work in the purpose of the Gospel and I feel that education and religion are closely related .
