ON November 11 , 1935 , in the flight sponsored jointly by the National Geographic Society and the United States Army Air Corps , Captain Orvil A. Anderson and I ascended in the gondola of Explorer II , the world 's largest balloon , to an officially recognized altitude of 72,395 feet , thereby exceeding all previous attempts to rise in the stratosphere . Taking off from the Stratobowl , near Rapid City , South Dakota , at 7:01 a. m. , Mountain Standard Time , we remained in the air 8 hours and 13 minutes , making an " eggshell landing " 12 miles south of White Lake , South Dakota , at 3:14 p. m . ( MST ) . Our load of approximately a ton of scientific instruments was uninjured , and it was found that every one of our mechanisms had functioned perfectly. * The question asked us most often of all is : " What does it feel like to be in the stratosphere ? " I suppose our questioners think one should be in a state of tingling excitement , as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression of the stratosphere was that of being in a profound calm , as we hung suspended nearly 13 3/4 miles high , motionless in air , although we were drifting with the air at a considerable speed . Our balloon even refused to turn , and my side of the gondola constantly faced toward the sun . Outside I could see , through one of the ports , our fan for turning the balloon revolving at the rate of 5,000 times a minute . But the ammeter , in circuit with the motor of the fan , showed that less and less power was required to turn it over , and the fan blades were now turning in air so thin that the propelling action was nil . At lower altitudes the fan had been effective in rotating the balloon , but we were now floating in the nearest approach to a natural vacuum in which man has ever placed himself . When we discharged ballast , it fell in a thin , unbroken stream , straight and true as the line of a plummet , no longer breaking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we released the spore-collecting apparatus of the Department of Agriculture , we watched in vain for its parachute to open . The air was too thin to spread the folds of fabric . But thousands of feet below us it must have opened , for it afterward was found to have operated successfully ( see text , page 81 ) . SUN 'S LIGHT WAS BLINDING To look directly at the sun through one of the portholes was blinding . The sun 's rays were unbelievably intense . Through the upper porthole we looked often at the vast bulk of the balloon , upon which the sun beat fiercely . The central appendix , a huge cloth tube seven and one-half feet across , was open , as we floated at our ceiling . The three side appendices also were open , all spilling helium gas from the bottom of the bag . But the gas coming out was quite invisible . There was not even the shimmering effect that one sometimes sees when two different gases mix . Through the central appendix we could look up to the very top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred yards above us , appeared like little buttons . The tapes of the massive dome formed a perfect pattern ? just like the meridians of longitude and parallels of latitude on a globe of the earth . The balloon envelope , which a few hours before had been a somewhat messy , crumpled , wrinkled pile of fabric in a pocket of the Black Hills of South Dakota , was now , in its brief hour of glory , a practically perfect sphere , 192 feet in diameter , and expanded to its full capacity of 3,700,000 cubic feet ? the largest sphere , by far , that man had ever constructed for any purpose whatsoever . The light inside the balloon  | was ample , for the single-ply fabric admitted a large part of the sun 's light . Our gondola " living room " was pleasant . If we had opened the switches to our batteries , had cut off our instruments , had silenced the radio , the quiet and stillness would perhaps have been maddening . But with life and action , our globular metal cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in . Its white walls reflected the light that entered through the glass portholes , so that it was not very dark within . NOISES OF A LOFTY LABORATORY On all sides we heard the constant clickings and whirrings and buzzings which meant that the many pieces of scientific apparatus were functioning . Every 90 seconds came the rattle of the electric hammer that beat on the case of the mercury column and aneroid barometer . Our radio listeners will recall that noise . We had provided this hammer to jar the column of mercury and the aneroid needle to overcome their tendency to lag , thus insuring more accurate readings . Its raucous note was the one irritation in our gondola , but we knew it to be necessary ? and it served to remind us of the passage of time . " WAS THE AIR BAD ? " Although we were sealed in an airtight ball and were manufacturing our own atmosphere , the air was quite as breathable as that in one 's home , and much better than that of most laboratories ? there were no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When , later on , we opened the manholes , the incoming fresh air seemed no different from that we had been breathing . Our air system on this trip worked perfectly , and we devoted practically no time to watching it ( see text , page 75 ) . Our one difficulty was that the humidity in the upper part of the gondola was sufficient to cause a constant deposit of frost on the glass of the upper port , through which we must watch the helium temperature gauge and the unfolding and refolding of the balloon . When we used our binoculars , one of us would rapidly wipe the window free of frost while the other took a quick  | reading . In ten seconds the window would frost again . But the other ports were quite free from frost . The upper part of this gondola , as was the case in 1934 , was the colder portion. * Water condensed on the upper walls and froze in a thin layer of ice . Thus they were very cold to the touch , but the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , were relatively warm . The hand could be held against the bottom part of the shell without discomfort . This difference , of course , was owing largely to the color of the gondola on the outside , for the lower hemisphere was painted black and the upper hemisphere was covered with a white paint of high reflecting power . The black paint absorbed heat from the sun and the earth ; the white paint kept a certain part of the sun 's energy from being absorbed by the gondola . The balance between the two was very good . *See " Exploring the Stratosphere , " by Captain Stevens , NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE , OCtober , 1934 , and other articles on The Society 's Stratosphere Expeditions , issues of April , 1934 , July , 1934 , February , 1935 , June , 1935 , and October , 1935 . At times the temperature inside the shell fell to 21 degrees , Fahrenheit ; at the top of the flight the inside temperature rose to 43 degrees , Fahrenheit . At no time were we uncomfortable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloves . Persons unfamiliar with conditions in the stratosphere may think it odd that we found the temperature both inside and outside the gondola lower at around 40,000 feet than we did at the top of our flight , some six miles higher . This " temperature inversion , " as it is called , is a normal condition , however , as one rises higher into the stratosphere . DRINKING WATER WARM ; SANDWICH FROZEN Captain Anderson tried to eat a sandwich , but it was frozen , and I saw it laid away on one of the instruments and apparently forgotten . I wondered momentarily at his sudden loss of interest in food . Although I had eaten little in the preceding 24 hours , I was not hungry . But I was consumed by a tremendous thirst , and from  | time to time I drank hastily from a gallon can containing water . Anticipating low temperature , we had put hot water in three cans before the flight , and had wrapped the cans in towels . Plain hot water from a can is not ordinarily anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it really tastes wonderfully good . Our exertions on the outside of the gondola , at 16,000 feet , before we closed the hatches , probably did as much as anything to create thirst . I must admit that I finished most of a gallon of water , which is quite a lot for one person in the space of a few hours . On the 1934 flight we had a similar experience . Perhaps the most extraordinary thing about these flights is the speed with which time passes . An hour seems like 20 minutes ! We tried to keep in constant touch with the world below by radio , but there were times when we simply had to take the earphones off in order to concentrate on other duties . From time to time I went the rounds of the various pieces of apparatus , reading meters , adjusting rheostats , listening for the noises that alone would tell whether certain instruments , hidden inside their metal cases , were still operating . Anderson used the radio only when absolutely necessary , for it took his mind off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a marvel of concentration , and after we had sealed ourselves in , he scarcely moved from a space two feet square . His right hand reached for the ballastreleasing device , or for the handles of the valves that fed compressed gas through hoses nearly 400 feet long , and so operated the balloon valves far above us . His left hand held a stop-watch , and his eyes were always on the bubble of the big statoscope , which told us whether we were going up or down , and the supersensitive Kollsman altimeter , which measured our height . Hanging beside these instruments was the condensed altitude table prepared by Dr. W. G. Brombacher , of the Bureau of Standards , showing , subject to temperature corrections , how many thousands of feet corresponded to pressures in millimeters of mercury . TELEPHONED TO AIRPLANES FOR POSITION Navigation was unnecessary . No time was wasted in plotting our progress across the country . Our vertical camera films would tell us that later . We found where we were , at any time , by asking Captain Randolph P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or our base radio station at Rapid City ( see text , page 84 ) .  | Anderson and I talked to each other remarkably little , and most of our conversation hinged on the appearance of the huge balloon as it slowly and majestically swelled to its full proportions . Through our vertical port we could see only a fraction of the outside surface of the balloon ? that part below the lower catenary band . That area was enormous ; from it we could only imagine the proportions of the remainder of the bag that was concealed from our view . A BREATH-CATCHING MOMENT It may sound ridiculous , but to me the only moment of the entire flight that was breath-catching was the time when the big central appendix first opened at 65,000 feet and through it I saw the dome of the balloon so far , so very far , above us . It was incredible that we were riding under such a mighty ball of gas ! The opening of the central appendix marked our arrival at " pressure height , " the altitude at which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout our rise , finally filled the huge bag completely and began to flow outward through these hanging chimneys of cloth which had been provided for that very purpose . I have remarked that time passed very fast , but , paradoxically , after we had been in the air five hours , it seemed at least twice that length of time since we had left the ground . I could picture again the take-off from the Stratobowl . The ropes holding the gondola to the wheeled platform , on which it had rested so long , had been cut away and our ground crew had " walked " the balloon and its burden as far as possible to one side of the bowl in the direction against the existing northwest wind , as shown by flags on the rim of the bowl and by small sounding balloons released a few minutes before . In the bottom of the bowl there was practically no wind at all , and the huge bag floated without a ripple in its surface .  | However , we knew that the moment we ascended 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now towering 315 feet above us , would be in the air current of approximately eight miles an hour that was sweeping across the rim of the bowl . TAKE-OFF FASTER THAN RACING BALLOONS The velocity of the wind had been observed constantly throughout the night by our recording instruments on the rim , and during the hour before the take-off an increase from six to eight miles an hour was registered . Our problem was to shoot the balloon from the ground with such speed that it would not drift sidewise enough to hit the trees on the rim of the bowl . When Captain Anderson gave the signal to release the ropes , we shot upward at a much greater speed than is given racing balloons on take-off . Our huge craft moved faster and faster , and it was evident that we were clearing the walls of the bowl with ease . Captain Anderson was on the outside of the gondola ; I was inside . We could look over the tree tops , see the plains beyond , and we knew that we were fully 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down through the open porthole . Suddenly he shouted to me , " I believe the balloon is leaking ! " I looked out of my manhole , saw that we were settling fast and sweeping down over the heads of the thousands of spectators . I recalled the first flight of Commander T. G. W. Settle at Chicago , when his valve stuck open , and when he rose a few thousand feet , only to come down almost immediately in the railroad yards of Chicago . And so my first thought was to do as Settle was forced to do on that memorable occasion : help discharge ballast fast enough to keep the balloon afloat until we could clear the spectators and perhaps get over an open space among the trees . There was not a second to lose .  | As Anderson sensed the fall of the bal loon , he shouted to me , stepped on the elec trical switch , and turned the handle that controlled the 40 sacks of ballast , totaling 3,000 pounds in weight , hung outside the gondola . In less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropping 750 pounds of ballast ( page 78 ) . I lifted a sack of ballast from the floor , held it out of a manhole , and pulled the pin from its bottom . The contents fell in a spray of fine lead directly on the head of a man who was already running from the rim of the bowl to get from beneath us . As the shower of fine lead struck him , he shouted , ducked his head , and seemed to run even faster , if that were possible ! We were now about 50 feet above the tree tops . To the right and left the dense crowd was scattering in a frantic attempt to get away from the towering structure that apparently was about to wreck itself and fall on the heads of many of them , who probably visualized themselves trapped under acres of rubber-coated fabric . But the balloon stopped its descent and started upward again . It was fortunate that we had available the electric ballast discharge built for quick emergency , and tested over and over again on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SPRINKLING OF LEAD SHOT When we had wired these sacks into place before the take-off , we had provided that a s the handle , operable from either inside or outside , was turned , from contact point to contact point , sacks would be exploded by dynamite caps and be dumped from oppo site sides of the gondola . Therefore , as Andy turned the handle that controlled the 40 sacks , lead shot spilled from ten 2-inch openings almost equally spaced around the gondola . From the ground , it may have appeared that we had turned on a sprinkler system . I have often wondered since how many scores of people were sprayed by those streams of fine shot .  | Now the balloon started to rise rapidly , but for a minute or more we did nothing but watch it to see if it would again show any tendency to settle . It continued climbing steadily . It was then apparent that we had encountered a strong downward trend of air which had forced the balloon earthward just as we swept towards the rim . Our electrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be proved whether our huge valves could halt the swift rise of the balloon . With both of us inside the gondola , Andy opened the valve controls . We watched the gauges and saw that the craft was still ascending far too fast . Unless we could check the ascent , we would not have enough time properly to inspect our outside rigging before being forced to close the manholes . Andy valved , and valved again and again ! As he opened the valves for still another half-minute interval ( which is a very long time for a balloon to be valved at low altitude ) , the balloon started to slow down . By this time we had reached 12,000 feet . Captain Anderson did not want to check our headway altogether , so he kept us moving slowly upward to 16,000 feet . GONDOLA TOP AN OBSERVATION PLATFORM Many people think it must have been extremely dangerous for us to walk around on the slippery surface on top of a gondola hanging in space . Actually there was no sensation of danger whatever . We climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , always having a handhold and a foothold . The ten 1-inch ropes that suspended the gondola from the rope load ring , six feet higher , were stretched taut and were practically as rigid as iron bars . Each of these ropes carried nearly 1,000 pounds of weight . Together , they formed a cage through which it would have been difficult to fall , unless one really tried to fall , as in the parachute jumps that Major William E. Kepner and Captain Anderson made from the Explorer I in 1934.  | The first thing to do was to let down the official meteorograph . This we lowered 33 feet below the bottom of the gondola , in compliance with the new regulations of the Federation Aeronautique Internationale . This instrument , on its smoked drum rotated by clockwork , recorded air pressure , instrument temperature , and the temperature of the air outside the instrument . These three things are needed properly to calculate altitude by the pressure method . The next thing to do was to let down the Dowmetal tube carrying the electrical thermometer resistance element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required about a minute , and it was necessary to wrap an arm and a leg in the rigging to resist the weight of the device as it came into position . The other operations required to put the ropes , hoses , and cords surrounding the gondola in order required little manual effort . Unnecessary dangling ropes were cut away and empty ballast bags were discarded . A check was made of the outside ballast that had been used and of the number of sacks remaining . As I called off the figures , Captain Anderson crossed the numbers of the used sacks from the numerals on the switch within the gondola.  | He passed out to me the small sack of " stratosphere mail " and I lashed it in the rigging in order to give us more room in the gondola . I removed the canvas cover which we had long had in place to protect the glass of the porthole in the center of the top of the gondola and then climbed down into the interior . I must confess that I had stayed a little longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather pleasant in the bright rays of the sun and much warmer than it had been in the Stratobowl , where the temperature was only five degrees above zero , Fahrenheit . CLOSING THE HATCHES The inside altimeter showed that we were now approaching the 17,000-foot level , and already we were beginning to be aware of the thinness of the air by our breathing , which was becoming deeper and faster than normal . It was essential that we get the hatches closed quickly . We had practiced this operation many times on the ground , and it took less than a minute to swing each manhole cover into position , thrust the steel pins into place , and tighten the pressure screws . Now came the time to test the gondola for gas leakage , and to see whether our liquid-air apparatus was adequate . Pressure from a small tank of helium was admitted to the top of a container holding a mixture of 45 per cent liquid oxygen and 55 per cent liquid nitrogen . We were using helium not only to bear us upward , but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our tests that helium , because it is comparatively insoluble in liquid air , worked more effectively for this purpose than other gases . This arrangement may have resulted in the mixture of a very small quantity of helium gas in the air we breathed . This fact was of no consequence , however , because helium is just as inert and harmless to man 's lungs as is nitrogen , which makes up nearly four-fifths of ordinary air . As soon as the helium from the little tank was turned on , the liquid started upward through the copper coil leading to the vaporizer . Air pressure inside the gondola immediately began to rise , and in about ten minutes we had caused the altimeter hand to move from 17,000 feet back to an indicated pressure of 13,000 feet . That is , in effect we gave ourselves the air pressure corresponding to an altitude of 13,000 feet . At this point we adjusted the automatic exhaust valve of the gondola to hold this pressure . This valve , operated by a copper bellows , called a sylphon , thereafter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value and required no further attention . We reduced the pressure slightly on the liquid-air apparatus , and thenceforth we glanced at the gauges only occasionally throughout the flight . An electric fan constantly circulated our gondola air through a tall metal cabinet containing a dozen sacks of sodium hydroxide , which were absorbing all of the carbon dioxide present in the air from our breathing , and most of the moisture . In the meantime , the gondola was steadily rising and the precision altimeter showed that we were now approaching 25,000 feet . GONDOLA UNDER PRESSURE Our gondola was under a pressure of two or three pounds to the square inch , exerted from the inside outward . Later this pressure would grow until it would reach about nine pounds when we attained our maximum elevation . This was because we were keeping the same air pressure inside the gondola , but were rising into regions where the outside pressure was falling lower and lower . We could have raised the pressure inside artificially by vaporizing liquid air at an even greater rate , until the pressure inside would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it required less liquid air to work at the reduced pressure corresponding to 13,000 feet of altitude . We used a liquidair mixture that was double strength in oxygen richness . The gondola easily could have withstood greater pressure inside . In fact , it had been tested with air to 18 pounds per square inch , and with water pressure to 42 pounds per square inch . The porthole glasses , carefully made and annealed by the Bausch and Lomb Optical Company , had been tested in our laboratory to a pressure of 100 pounds per square inch . We had no concern whatever about our gondola , its manholes , or its port glasses . Steadily our ascent continued and at 10:30 o'clock ( MST ) , just 3 hours and 29 minutes after our take-off , we had reached pressure height ! That is , our great balloon was actually full , and overflowing from the bottom as the sun 's rays warmed  | the gas inside . This was It 65,000 feet , as calculated by the designers . To go higher we must discharge ballast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead shot , while with stop-watch he calculated the rate of rise . Looking up into the interior of the balloon , we could see the special small meteorograph of the Bureau of Standards hanging 40 feet below the top . It had been placed there to record conditions inside the balloon . Between the two valves , and a few feet below , inside the balloon , was a thermometer of circular design , three feet in diameter . The unaided eye could not read the position of the thermometer hand , so we brought our ten-power binoculars into use , and found that the temperature of the helium gas in the balloon was four below zero , Fahrenheit . Outside the balloon , the air temperature varied from 70 to 78 degrees below zero , Fahrenheit . We had some 74 degrees of superheat already . Superheat is the term that describes the excess in temperature of the gas inside a balloon over the outside air temperature . At high altitudes , the amount of heat received by the balloon from the sun is very great . This heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As we watched , the thermometer hand inside the balloon climbed steadily . Soon it was five degrees above , and then 14 degrees above . In less than an hour it got to 32 degrees , Fahrenheit . This thermometer was important to us , for every degree that it registered higher meant that we must reserve a certain extra amount of ballast for the descent , if we were to land the balloon without crashing it . One can not prevent the gas from acquiring superheat in sunlight ; one can not avoid cooling of the gas and loss of superheat on the descent ? and loss of it is loss of lift . On the way down , ballast must be discharged to compensate for this loss just as , on the ascent , it must be discharged to permit the balloon to rise . Near the top of our ascent Captain Anderson discharged bag after bag of ballast , sending us higher and higher . AT THE TOP ! When we had discharged all the ballast deemed advisable , the balloon stopped rising , and began moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the preceding one . The huge appendices gently closed ? opened ? closed again . Finally , at 11:40 a. m . ( MST ) came the big moment when we were at the top . Our precision altimeter registered 27% millimeters of mercury . I opened the case of the Factograph ( which automatically photographed the instrument readings ) to look at the mercury column to see whether it could really be true that we were floating in air so thin that it would hold up only a little more than an inch of mercury . I opened the door quickly , for I did not dare let any moisture form on the barometer tube lest it spoil the photographic records . And , sure enough , the difference in the levels of the two arms of the U-shaped barometer was only a little over an inch . At sea level our atmosphere holds up a column of mercury approximately 30 inches high ; here the air pressure was only enough to support a column less than a twenty-fifth as high . This meant that 24 of 25 parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level ? only one twenty-fifth above us . Reference to the correction table showed that the altimeter had a 2-millimeter correction at the part of the scale now reached , and that our altitude should be that corresponding to 29% millimeters , or 73,000 feet . This correction was a rough and ready one which could give us only an approximation of the truth . We knew that we would have to await the calibration of the instruments after the flight and corrections because of temperature in order to learn our true altitude ( see text , page 74 ) . It was a temptation to both of us to discharge more ballast and see the altimeter hand move to 26 or 25 . At great altitudes it takes only a little more than a millimeter of mercury to cover a thousand feet of rise . We knew we could dump another thousand pounds of ballast and go 2,000 feet higher . But would we have enough ballast left to keep us from crashing on landing ? We could not afford to overlook the fact that the most vital function of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the safety of an expedition is concerned , is its release during the downward trip , and , especially as the earth is approached , to reduce the speed of descent and bring the craft gently to its landing .  | We counted our remaining sacks inside the gondola , counted the unused spaces on the electric ballast-firing device , added up the weights of the batteries that hung from pins on the outside of the gondola , and reluctantly agreed that we had expended all the ballast we should . Reference to the curve sheets of Dr. L. B. Tuckerman and Mr. F. D. Swan confirmed the soundness of this decision . It was now nearly noon ( MST ) . We had been near or at ceiling since 10:30 o'clock . Soon we must start the descent . Observations of the earth and sky were made at the top of the flight , 13.71 miles above sea level . The earth could be seen plainly underneath through the lower porthole and hundreds of miles in every direction through the side portholes . It was a vast expanse of brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads and automobile highways were invisible , houses were invisible , and railroads could be recognized only by an occasional cut or fill . The larger farms were discernible as tiny rectangular areas . Occasional streaks of green vegetation showed the presence of streams . Here and there water could be seen in the form of rivers or lakes , especially if the sun was reflected from the water 's surface . No sign of actual life on the earth could be detected . To us it was a foreign and lifeless world . The sun was the one object that commanded our attention ; we were temporarily almost divorced from Mother Earth . SUNLIGHT BLINDING ; SKY NEARLY BLACK Overhead , the great balloon blocked our view of the sky above us . How I wished at this time that we could have a central tube in the balloon through which we could look at the zenith ! I am sure that the sky would have been so dark directly overhead that we could have seen the stars at noonday . As it was , we could see the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angle of about 55 degrees above the horizon . The horizon itself was a band of white haze . Above it the sky was light blue , and  | perhaps 20 or 30 degrees from the horizon it was of the blue color that we are accustomed to . But at the highest angle that we could see it , the sky became very dark . I would not say that it was completely black ; it was rather a black with the merest suspicion of very dark blue . In the rigging hung a new flag of the United States . This flag was in full sunlight and I compared the blue of the field of this flag with that of the sky . Now the blue of our regulation flag is quite deep in shade , but it appeared a much lighter blue than the blue of the stratosphere sky . We remained at our ceiling for an hour and a half , our instruments clicking away as if to make the most of their unique opportunity . Then Captain Anderson opened one of the valves to start the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he valved again and again . Finally the balloon started into positive descent . SPORES AT HIGH ALTITUDE When we were absolutely sure that it was in descent , I pulled the release that caused the spore-collecting apparatus to fall free of the gondola . It was returned in excellent condition to Washington by its finder , Mr. Frank Brtna , of Academy , South Dakota . Dr. L. A. Rogers , at the Department of Agriculture , found that it had worked satisfactorily and had gathered spores on its descent from the upper air , before the sylphon-actuated device had closed its orifices at a high altitude . We also took with us from the earth several kinds of spores , * supplied by Mr. Fred C. Meier , of the U. S. Department of Agriculture , enclosed in tiny quartz tubes . These were hung on the outside of the gondola , exposed to sunlight and stratosphere temperatures and pressures to determine whether they could survive such conditions . The specimens consisted of millions of spores far too small to be seen with the naked eye , representing seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Despite the rigorous conditions to which the spores were subjected , five of the seven types germinated and grew normally when brought back to the laboratory , showing that apparently they were not injured by the ordeal . The sixth type germinated only to a limited extent and tests on the seventh type have not been completed . We carried the package of Drosophila ( fruit flies ) , furnished by the University of Wisconsin , throughout the flight in the hope of finding whether their exposure to the bombardment of the cosmic rays that entered the sphere would affect the characteristics of their descendants . The package was sent on to the University of Wisconsin shortly after we landed , and it has been found that only three of the larvae of the flies survived . Generations of young will be bred from these three individuals and will be carefully studied . The results will not be known for several months . TAKING SAMPLES OF AIR When we were assured that we were falling constantly , I broke the seals on the previously evacuated air-sample flasks and opened all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , replaced the protecting caps , and sealed the caps with lead seals . During the flight , especially at the higher altitudes , we saw through our portholes that vapors were forming in considerable quantity around the gondola . These vapors appeared to come from the gondola on all sides . At times they were so thick as to give the appearance of heavy smoke clouds from something burning on the outside of the gondola . Since our ballast bags had been fireproofed , it was unlikely that the dynamite caps could have ignited them . It is more than likely that the vapors came from evaporation of battery liquid in the storage batteries that hung from our gondola , and from moisture contained in parachute bags and in ropes of the rigging . These vapors were seen only at the higher elevations . It was during the descent , when a pronounced upflow of air passed the gondola , that our air samples were taken . There may be possibility of contamination of the samples with a trace of water vapor , but the effect on the percentage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At this time we were moving slowly but steadily downward . It was necessary for Captain Anderson to open the valves repeatedly in order to keep the balloon moving downward . Whenever he ceased valving the balloon tended to stop .  | Later on in the flight , when the balloon was in the cold and comparatively heavy air around 40,000 feet , the gas cooled rapidly ; whereupon the balloon fell , without being valved , with ever-increasing speed . The vertical aerial camera had been clicking and winding regularly since the start of the flight . Pictures had already been made of the earth and horizon with another Fairchild aerial camera , loaded with Eastman infra-red film . Now , as the balloon rotated slowly while descending , more pictures of the horizon were made . Aerial motion pictures of the earth were made with a Bell and Howell Eyemo camera loaded with infra-red film . Color pictures of the earth , the sky , and the balloon were made with an Eastman CineKodak loaded with Kodachrome film . A National Graflex was used at the top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an instrument for indicating a change in gravity . On the descent the almost black aspect of the sky did not change materially until we had dropped about four miles . Our balloon was shrinking in size and therefore we could look more toward the vertical as we lost elevation . The great bag slowly commenced to fold together at the bottom , and soon it was apparent that all four appendices were closing so tightly that no air was entering the balloon . INSTRUMENT RECORDS ON 9,600 FILMS The cosmic ray apparatus , installed in the gondola by Dr. W. F. G. Swann and Mr. Oscar Steiner , of the Bartol Research Foundation of the Franklin Institute , had been started an hour before we reached our maximum ceiling . The cameras of the Stoss chamber and the Geiger counters , for recording effects and direction of cosmic rays , continued to run throughout most of the descent , up to the time when we were forced to cut loose the operating batteries for ballast on parachutes . At the higher elevations the clicking of electrical devices , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were passing through the instruments at a rate roughly between 100 and 150 times the rate at ground level . Throughout the descent our four Graflex Factograph cameras operated continuously , making at 15- and 90-second intervals records of pressure , temperature , gondola position , sky and sun brightness . The total number of exposures in the four Factographs was 9,600 ; films when developed proved to be perfect . The film records of temperature in the stratosphere are regarded by the Bureau of Standards as being most valuable additions to meteorological knowledge . The electrical thermometer , partly constructed by the National Bureau of Standards and partly by Wright Field , proved to be an instrument far more sensitive to temperature changes than any that has previously recorded the temperature of the stratosphere . The records , both on ascent and descent , conclusively prove that there are decided changes in temperature at different levels of the stratosphere that have previously been undetermined by the ordinary type of thermometer . The films made by the two spectrographs have been developed and it has been found that they afford complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of ozone present in the atmosphere . These instruments , made by the Bausch and Lomb Optical Company under the direction of Dr. Brian O'Brien , of the University of Rochester , and Dr. F. L. Mohler , of the Bureau of Standards , carried camera mechanisms made by the Graflex Corporation , and operated throughout the entire flight , making spectrograms through optical systems of quartz . Throughout the flight the apparatus of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism , of the Carnegie Institution of Washington , made a record of the electrical conductivity of the air . This record was delivered to Mr. O. H. Gish , who designed the apparatus , and Mr. Kenneth L. Sherman and Mr. G. L. Churchwell , who built and installed it . RADIO WORKED PERFECTLY Of the many items of apparatus , none functioned more perfectly than the radio apparatus of the National Broadcasting Company . At frequent intervals I talked to Mr. Robert M. Morris , Mr. C. P. Sweeney , and Mr. J. A. Wies , engineers of the National Broadcasting Company , at Rapid City . The transmission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept constant by an ingenious " gain control " installed this year by Mr. Morris . Substantially , this device had the effect of making the microphone less sensitive when one was  | near it and more sensitive when one was farther away . It was largely because of this feature that listeners with short wave radio sets could hear us working and talking in the gondola even when we had no intention of addressing the public . THE ETERNAL QUESTION If any difficulty existed , it was in reception , because I was sometimes careless in tuning in or in the use of the volume control on the receiver . Sometimes the clatter of instruments made repetition necessary . Even at 10 miles above the earth Andy , the married member of the crew , was not beyond his family 's voice . Mrs. Anderson , in the National Broadcasting Company tent at the Stratobowl , asked her husband , " How is everything ? Where are you now ? " " Very good , Muddy , " was the reply . " Where are you ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dryly , adding that our altitude was about 54,000 feet and that we were on the way to our ceiling . " Fine , and best of luck ! " said Mrs. Anderson , far below us , completing a call that had been put through as readily as a telephone call to the corner grocery . Again I was amused when I overheard the instructions , given on short wave , of an eastern announcer to his fellow announcers . " Do n't play up this record business , boys , until we are sure that they have gotten clown safely , " he suggested . " There is still plenty of chance for them to crash and they have to come down alive to make it a record . " HEARD AROUND THE WORLD Reports received by the National Geoaraphic Society and the National Broadcasting Company show that our voices were heard directly over the short waves which we were sending out from the gondola from California to New York and North Carolina , and from Calgary , Canada , to Texas . We were heard , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , but these more distant stations may have been picking up the rebroadcast short waves from the Bound Brook , New Jersey , transmitter of the National Broadcasting Company . Word has not yet come to us concerning the reception of our short wave broadcast in Australia and New Zealand , but it is likely that our voices were heard there , because high-frequency signals ordinarily pass from America to those countries with great ease . After we had reached our peak altitude and had started preparations for the descent , we were tremendously pleased to hear the N. B. C. announcer tell us that General Westover , Dr. Grosvenor , and Dr. Briggs , at the National Geographic Society headquarters in Washington , wished to talk with us . It was particularly to the loyal and steadfast support of these three that we owed our flight , and we were glad for the unusual opportunity to thank them from the highest point from which a voice had ever been heard . A HISTORIC RADIO HOOK-UP A high spot of the afternoon was at 2:15 ( MST ) when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying over the Pacific Ocean between San Diego and San Francisco . We conversed briefly with Captain Edwin C. Musick and with William Burke Miller of the National Broadcasting Company , aboard the air liner . It was pleasant to talk to Burke , for he had been closely associated with us on our previous stratosphere expeditions ( see page 80 ) . Then Burke arranged for me to talk to London , and shortly I heard an Englishman , Mr. Hugh Chevins , asking me questions about the balloon , particularly about a rip in the envelope which had occurred during inflation and its repair ( see text , page 91 ) . It seems that news of the accidental rip already had reached England , but apparently our friend in London thought that it had occurred while we were in flight , and that we had succeeded in repairing it ourselves . I did not grasp the situation and started to tell him how the rip was repaired by our ground crew . The result was a conversation which must have been extremely funny to listeners-in . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Times about this incident , from which I quote the following extract : " Two men in the metal gondola are hurtling down through the South Dakota skies from a height of 72,000 feet . At the same time they are talking to a reporter in a  | newspaper office in London . But listen to a bit of the conversation : " What about the rip in your balloon ? ' " What about it ? ' " What happened ? ' " We fixed it . ' " You fixed it ? ' " Yes , we patched it . It was a rip about 17 feet long . ' " What exactly did you do ? ' " What did we do ? ' " How did you fix it ? ' " We simply cemented it . We put a patch on . ' " Most extraordinary . But how did you do it ? ' " ( Conversation ends . ) " Could anything be simpler ? We build gas bags and gondolas with extraordinary skill . We fill the bag with rare gases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to measure the stratosphere 's light , air , heat , cosmic rays , magnetism , microbes , what not . We install radios by which we can talk from beyond the Dakota clouds to London ; and then , when the bag rips at the last moment , we borrow some cement and patch it up , and climb to 72,000 feet . " Unfortunately , it was absolutely necessary to tear off the headphones and go to work before the conversation was concluded with our London friend , for Captain Anderson had repeatedly reminded me that it was nearly time to open the hatches . " CRACKING THE MANHOLE " Our elevation was now 16,000 feet . Our inside pressure still held at 13,000 feet ; as I cracked the manhole on my side of the gondola , a hiss of air marked the equalization of pressure , and immediately we felt the sudden pressure change on our eardrums . When the hatches were swung open , air from the outside started to circulate through the gondola ( see text , page 75 ) . The first thing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the air-conditioning outfit . Together , Anderson and I struggled with these bulky and cumbersome containers and shortly we had hooked them to one of the parachutes , provided for such a purpose , that hung outside the gondola just above a manhole ( see illustration , page 74 ) . We let them go , and immediately the parachute opened , letting the heavy objects float gently to the ground . They were recovered by local peo- ple probably not more than 15 minutes later and were brought to the landing place within an hour or so . Next consigned to a parachute was a sack full of oxygen cylinders . Under the direction of Captain Anderson , who was watching our rate of fall , I released battery after battery by pulling metal pins from sockets in the wall of the gondola . The releases worked perfectly and quickly ; at one time there were three parachutes in the air at the same time . Around us flew several airplanes , but we paid them scant attention . Below us the roads in all directions were white with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our probable point of landing ( see page 82 ) . Other batteries followed by parachute , and sack after sack of lead shot was spilled . No solid object was discarded except by parachute . A PERFECT LANDING Andy climbed outside , unlashed the end of the rip cord and brought it within the gondola opening . He then cut one end of the dragrope loose , and as the loose end fell and whipped about , it jarred the gondola momentarily . We donned our football helmets , borrowed from the team of the Calvin Coolidge High School of Rapid City , and hooked across the inside of the gondola a strong linen strap to which we could hold if necessary . The balloon , traveling at 12 miles an hour , also was settling slowly . The dragrope was touching the ground . Its tip trailed through an isolated patch of woods , and then it dragged half its length through a field . Ahead of us was a ravine , and beyond it a large field that looked promising as a landing place . We shouted again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automobiles to get out and seize the dragrope . As the rope trailed along a road one automobile actually straddled it . Shortly afterward , one man ran beside the rope and caught hold of it , only to drop it immediately . Apparently people were in awe of the towering structure of the balloon , and had no confidence that they could retard its progress . Had 20 men succeeded in grabbing the dragrope they could have stopped the drift of the balloon . In this case , we could have valved the balloon down , thereby avoiding the need of ripping it . But it was apparent that we could not obtain help from the spectators who were trailing us , and so we resolved to rip the balloon as we touched the ground . Andy instructed me to discharge a couple of small sacks of lead shot to hold the balloon off , and then he shouted , " Make ready for the landing ! " I scrambled across the gondola just in time to help him with the rip cord . As I glanced through the porthole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the ground . Andy 's weight was already on the cord , and as we pulled we felt the steel cable tear through the fabric and sensed that the top of the balloon had opened . We grabbed for the linen strap and simultaneously the gondola struck the ground ( Plates III , IV ) . Held by the drag of the 500-foot rope , and released from the support of the bag , the gondola stopped practically at once , and immediately turned over on its side . A quantity of lead shot that had been previously accidentally spilled on the floor came in a shower all over us . The air was momentarily filled with flying clothing , empty cans , ballast sacks , small cameras , tools , and other objects . We swung onto the linen strap and our feet touched things that we could stand upon . I looked down and found that Andy was standing on the spectrograph , while I was standing on the Geiger counter apparatus ! We took a brief look around and then started to climb out . To our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lieutenant B. S. Kelsey and Lieutenant B. B. Talley had guessed our landing place , and had landed with their airplane . Talley had actually made two exposures , on the ground , of our landing , and was at the gondola before we could get out . In less than five minutes we were surrounded by scores of automobiles and hundreds of people . In a short time the crowd had increased to thousands and it became a problem to hold them back . Fortunately , it was an amiable crowd and no damage was done to the gondola or the balloon . AIRPLANES CONVERGE AT LANDING PLACE It was only a short time before airplanes piloted by Captain R. P. Williams , Captain H. K. Baisley , Captain J. F. Phillips , Captain James G. Haizlip , and Mr. R. E.  | Nelson , from the Sioux Skyways , arrived , bringing our own Air Corps men of Scott Field and the Goodyear-Zeppelin balloon crew . Shortly afterward Major C. D. McAllister , who had been delayed by mechanical trouble , arrived , bringing other technical assistants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balloon throughout the flight , was Mr. Thomas W. McKnew , of the National Geographic Society , who had so capably taken care of the administrative duties of our expedition and materially contributed to its ultimate success . About 50 men of the Civilian Conservation Corps from the Lake Andes Camp arrived by truck and assisted in guarding property and collecting equipment . Soon afterward the cavalry guard arrived from Fort Meade by truck , and two trucks , sent by Maj. Gen. Frank C. Bolles , Corps Area Commander , appeared from Fort Omaha and Fort Robinson , Nebraska . A guard was placed overnight , and the next day , with all the help available , everything was loaded for transfer east . Our flight , successful beyond our hopes , was made possible in large part by the months of careful preparation that preceded the take-off . Our balloon , our gondola , and all our equipment were made and handled with such care that we had absolute confidence in them throughout our flight . We were confident that the calculations of the Bureau of Standards , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balloon , were entirely correct , and that the minimum factor of safety of the envelope on this flight was four and one-half . In other words , the balloon had at least four and one-half times the strength it needed to carry its own weight and that of the gondola . The cloth was made of specially selected long-staple cotton and , to keep the gas from filtering through , the fabric was rubberized in 30 separate operations . The envelope of July , 1935 , was almost identical in construction , and it would not have failed then had it not been for stresses set up at the upper end of the rip panel . Neither in the balloon of 1934 , Explorer I , nor in the balloon that tore during the inflation of July , 1935 , was there the slightest indication of poor workmanship or material . All that can be said now is that we then did not know enough about the problems of design of such a tremendous envelope ? an envelope more than four times the volume of any balloon that had previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July , an investigation was made immediately by a committee composed of Brigadier General Oscar Westover , Acting Chief of the U. S. Army Air Corps , Dr. Lyman J. Briggs , Director of the National Bureau of Standards , Dr. Karl Arnstein , Vice President of the GoodyearZeppelin Corporation , Mr. Thomas W. McKnew , Assistant Secretary of the National Geographic Society , and the flight personnel . When it became evident that the trouble was solely in the design of the rip panel , it was decided to abandon the conventional panel . In its place was provided a device in the  | form of a thin , flexible steel cable for ripping a 25-foot hole in the top of the bag on landing ( see page 71 ) . The balloon used on the flight was the same one used last July ; to it the manufacturers had fitted a new top and a new upper catenary band . In the balloon , as received from the factory , we had the greatest confidence . But during the process of inflation , a very disconcerting accident happened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside a tent at a temperature of 50 degrees Fahrenheit . On the afternoon of inflation it was quite flexible , and our ground crew had no trouble in getting it out of the box . But when they started to spread it on the " ground cloths , " or canvas floor , difficulty began , because the balloon fabric cooled quickly to almost zero temperature . It became difficult to stretch the stiffened fabric into position for inflation , and some of the coils of fabric in the pile under the balloon were cramped more than we wished . A RIP DURING INFLATION As inflation proceeded , most of the gas went directly upward into the bag and raised it . Some gas , however , formed a pocket in the pile of fabric underneath . The heavy folds of fabric blocked the flow of gas upward in such a way that a ball of gas , half as big as an automobile , formed and was submitted to practically the full pressure of the helium coming through the 10-inch canvas hose . Mr. J. R. Kelley , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above it and shouted to the inflation crew to stop the flow of gas . It was impossible to shut the gas off quickly  | enough to save the envelope , for in less than half a second there was a faint pop , and we knew that a burst had occurred somewhere in the mass of fabric . The balloon was allowed to rise slowly while we hurriedly made a search for the rip , which we visualized as being perhaps two or three feet long . It was now midnight , and fully an hour was lost in searching for the rupture . Finally it was found , and the tear proved to be 17 feet long ! A hasty conference followed , and Captain Anderson and I decided to go ahead . Mr. J. F. Cooper , builder of the balloon , Mr. Kelley , and our noncommissioned officers from Scott Field immediately started to repair the long fissure . It was indeed a difficult situation . The temperature was down almost to zero , and these men had the task of cementing a patch at that low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way that the patch would bear , throughout the flight , its share of the great weight of the fabric below and the gondola . Our Army sergeants lined up on each side of the rent , a piece of balloon cloth was thrown over their heads , thereby making a sort of tent , and a huge 1,500-watt bulb and reflector were brought inside to heat the air of the tent and to radiate heat on the patching material . Working together under these uncomfortable and awkward conditions , the Goodyear-Zeppelin and Army men cemented first a 2-inch strip of tape along the fissure and then covered it with a 5-inch cemented patch . Unlike any other part of the balloon , the seam was reinforced wholly on the outside of the balloon . It is to the credit of these men that this patch held perfectly , and that an examination of the balloon after it landed showed the cement had not given in the least degree . It was our confidence in these men that made us go ahead with the flight . Had  | we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight then and there . Too much credit can not be given to Captain Randolph P. Williams , of the Air Corps . This officer , qualified to fly airplanes , dirigibles , or balloons , was ready to take the place of either Anderson or myself had we for any reason been unable to make the flight . In addition , he was charged with the duties of ground operation officer and also with that most important position of meteorological officer . In the early days at camp , a no-inflation decision was received good-humoredly , for everyone felt , from records of past years , that another good day would come within the next week or two . Later we came to watch the approach of winter with some concern . Week after week passed , and although some pessimism might have been justified by the disappointing weather , the morale of the camp remained high . WATCHING THE WEATHER The weather men , receiving faint praise , went methodically about their tasks . Early in the morning they drew the midnight and six o'clock surface weather maps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew the third and fourth maps of the day . The direction of winds at various levels was plotted and curves showing the dryness of the air aloft were drawn . Maps showing changes in atmospheric pressure every three hours were constructed twice daily . Once a day a map of the eastern Pacific Ocean was prepared in order to study the source of the air masses coming toward Rapid City . The problem of these meteorological men was much more difficult than that of the average weather station , for they were charged with predicting more than a day ahead the condition that would positively insure absence of gusts of wind in the Stratobowl on the entire night of inflation , a cloudless day for the flight itself , and a ground wind of not more than 15 miles per hour in the area of landing . High-pressure area after high-pressure area moved across the country , but each time the Stratobowl was too far from the center of high pressure to justify inflating the balloon . Mr. V. E. Jakl of the United States Weather Bureau and Sergeant W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the worries of the weather station . Day by day they became more serious and the hours they spent over the maps increased . One can imagine , therefore , our relief when the weather maps of November 9 showed the high-pressure area forming at a point that made it likely that it would move over Rapid City . The early-morning weather maps of November 10 so strengthened our belief that a good inflation day was at hand that preparations were started even before the noon map was drawn . Telegrams were dispatched and telephone calls brought additional soldiers , from the Fourth Cavalry , commanded by Colonel Robert McC . Beck , Jr. , at Fort Meade , 30 miles north of Rapid City . As expected , the temperature had already dropped 20 degrees , and it was certain that during the night temperatures approaching zero would exist . Every one ? scientist , soldier , and spectator ? knew that he faced a cold , uncomfortable night . But , strange to say , no one seemed to consider seriously his approaching hardships . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the night , complained . There was a certain excitement , caused by the extraordinary spectacle of a tremendous envelope rising majestically in the center of a huge circle of lights , that kept everyone on the alert . The lighting engineers , who were from the Homestake Mining Company , of Lead , South Dakota , kept their engines running to furnish power to our huge battery of lamps . Had their machinery once failed , we would have been in darkness , but it was perfectly installed and functioned constantly . A newspaper could be read anywhere within the circle of lights , 360 feet in diameter , at any time during the night . Under the direction of Fort Meade officers , the cavalrymen carried out their unaccustomed duties as balloon crew practically as perfectly as if they had received long training in balloon work . Then came the time when our Air Corps men attached the gondola to the balloon and when , shortly afterward , the last ropes that ran to the top of the balloon were cast off . THE FUTURE OF STRATOSPHERE FLIGHTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that with hydrogen as a lifting gas , with knowledge of the flight characteristics of this huge balloon , and with provision for certain of the heavy items of apparatus to be carried in releasable form on the out- side of the gondola , we could fly the same balloon , with the same load of scientific apparatus , to at least 78,000 feet . However , no plans for another flight exist at this time . It is necessary first to make a study of the scientific data obtained to determine whether another flight to a greater altitude would be justified . If in the future it should be desirable to take instruments to a still higher altitude ? possibly to 95,000 feet ? this may be made possible by constructing a somewhat larger balloon with an envelope of rubberized silk instead of rubberized cotton , thereby reducing the weight of the bag forty per cent . It is problematical whether a much larger balloon than the Explorer II should be built , because of the difficulties of handling and inflating , the increasing cost and the decreasing factor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world where it is safe to inflate such huge bags , for they tower into the air until they encounter strong air currents unless protected by a wall such as that of the natural bowl at Rapid City . Our meteorologists have found , from a study of data of several years past , that even on nights when there is a dead calm on the ground , there is , in open country , almost always a wind of six to eight miles an hour at 300 feet . It is evident that inflation of these very lofty bags in the open is a far more hazardous problem than inflation of smaller balloons . We should keep in mind that these stratosphere balloons come down with the gas , which filled them at high altitude , squeezed into a relatively tiny ball in the top of the envelope . A comparatively small area of the top then bears the total weight of the envelope and the gondola , and a portion of the top must be made stronger to prevent it from bursting or tearing . As we go higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller and smaller on the landing , and , unless the balloon be properly designed , we may find that we have made a flight to very great altitude , only to crash when almost on the ground . It is evident that the problems of stratosphere ballooning should be studied very carefully . To get still more . altitude , the balloon may be flown to a maximum ceiling by dropping all ballast , and saving none for descent ; the gondola may be cut away at the top of the flight on a large parachute , leaving the balloon to go still higher with light automatic instruments while the gondola floats to earth with the men and the major portion of the scientific- apparatus . The fall of such a gondola on a parachute in the extremely thin upper air of the stratosphere would be for tens of thousands of feet before the parachute would really retard it . That would be a ride !  |
