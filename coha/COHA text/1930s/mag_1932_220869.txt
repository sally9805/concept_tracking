Britain may be a nation of shopkeepers , but her shopkeepers are exceedingly jealous of her ships &; sailors-world 's largest merchant marine . And Britain 's shipping tycoons are jealous of their individual companies . Though big lines in Italy . Germany , Japan and the U. S. have pocketed their pride and combined for economy ( TIME , Nov. 7 ) , Liverpool 's stubborn operators are still fighting it out from Land 's End to Sandy Hook , from Manchester to Sunda Strait . Last week what observers thought was a step toward a truce was taken when Frederick William Lewis Lord Essendon , 62-year-old chairman of Furness , Withy &; Co. , was elected head of White Star Line ( Oceanic Steam Navigation Co . ) . John Pierpont Morgan the Elder in 1902 tossed White Star into International Mercantile Marine , his great pot of North Atlantic shipping . For $35,000,000 I. M. M. tossed it out to Lord Kylsant 's Royal Mail Steam Packet Co. ( chartered by Queen Victoria ) in 1926 . After towering Lord Kylsant ( " Lord of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mail stock with a fraudulent prospectus , White Star bulked large in the scrambled affairs of fallen Royal Mail . Still owed to I. M. M. on the purchase price was ( and is ) $11,000,000 . Like most transatlantic lines White Star was running in the red . Reports that Lord Essendon 's Furness , Withy or Cunard were dickering for it have popped up almost monthly . Though the election of Lord Essendon as White Star 's chairman involved no deal , shipping men believed a merger was in the books . Last year alert Lord Essendon persuaded his stockholders to authorize an additional 2,000,000 shares of stock " to take advantage of any favorable opportunities which might present themselves for still further expanding business . " In the reorganization of Royal Mail , effected last August , Lord Essendon played a lead part . One-half of Royal Mail 's one and one-half million tons of shipping were grouped into two new operating subsidiaries , one combining services to Africa 's west coast , one to South America 's east coast . Lord Essendon became head of the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capetown and Africa 's east coast , Lamport &; Holt , owner of the ill-fated Vestris , and White Star continued to operate as separate Royal Mail subsidiaries . <P> Against the crack ships of Sir Percy 's fleet , the Berengaria , Aquitania and Mauretania , Lord Essendon pits his Majestic , " world 's biggest ship , " his Olympic , his new Georgic . Both face stern competition from the French Line , the North German Lloyd-Hamburg-American combination , U. S. Lines and to a lesser extent from Il Duce 's Italia Line . Though Tsar Emil Lederer of the Transatlantic Passenger Conference keeps fares equalized for all , the fight for traffic is hot , the profits nil . Only big British shipping concern to escape the woes of the North Atlantic dogfight is the late great Lord Inchcape 's mighty Peninsular &; Oriental Steam Navigation Co . World 's largest steamship company , P. &; O. operates almost two million tons of shipping , chiefly over the Empire route to India , the Far East and Australasia .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
