txt The city council was urged yesterday to provide facilities for sun bathers on Chicago beaches . The proposal was hedged about , however , with restrictions designed to mollify snitlish ladies and gentlemen who have sniffed at the carryings on of nudist cults In Germany and elsewhere in Europe . A resolution , introduced by Ald. George A. Williston 49th , would authorize Arne L. Suominen , 3619 Southport avenue , designated the spokesmen for a large group of Citizens interested in sun bathing , to build an enclosure for that purpose on the Rogers Park beach . It was provided that the enclosure should be of sufficient height " to obstruct any view of the interior ; from nearby buildings or other vantage points , " and that it should be divided by a wall into separate spaces for men and women . The matter was referred to the committee on parks and playgrounds . Aldermen said that . if it is approved later by the council they would ask that the building commissioner subject Mr. Suominen 's enclosure to a special inspection for knotholes.  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
