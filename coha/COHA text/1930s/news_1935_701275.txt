txt California defeated Cornell 's Varsity today by three-fifths of a second for the championship of the Intercollegiate Rowing Association . That meant ten feet of gleaming cedar shell at the end of one of the most grueling four-mile races the country has yet had . The winners ' time , 18:52 , was the second fastest four miles ever Irowed on the Hudson and the Poughkeepsie race of 1935 lived up in every respect to expectations . There have never been more tightly fought races over that four-mile course and there have been very ifew that even matched today 's , which was rowed in a sullen gray setting of rain and lowering clouds . Strung out behind in the following order came Washington , leader for the first two and a half miles ; Navy , Syracuse , Pennsylvania and Columbia . And for all seven of the crews in the race there was the satisfaction of knowing they had rowed a great race and had contributed a full share to as vivid a drama as has ever been played before the green , wooded drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climax of the three-race regatta , there was the wild confusion and thrill of a finish so close that for minutes afterward no one but the officials on the finish floats were certain who had won . And earlier than this , half-way through the event , there had come the always moving sight of an underdog refusing to accept the role assigned him . Navy was to be the Eastern crew which threatened the rule of the West . But it was the Cornell eight , in the last half , that fought its way to the edge of victory . It was not until the last two miles or , really , the last mile and a half , that the issue settled finally and definitely into one between the two which were so heartbreakingly close together at the finish . Washington led for nearly all of the first two and a half miles , at one point by more than a boat length . And for the full first mile the seven crews were locked together like race horses . Pennsylvania and Columbia were the first to fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the long journey to town , Navy and Syracuse stayed well up in the running , never allowing open water and always threatening . California went from fifth place when it finally made its bid , moving slowly , evenly and relentlessly through the pack to take command just before the eights headed under the gaunt , black steel towers of the railroad bridge at the start of the last long mile . The Bears moved , then , away from everybody except the Cornell eight that simply refused to be shaken off . Gradually through the last mile California and Cornell moved into the lead . Washington had rowed its race , had turned in a brilliant exhibition in a desperate effort to sweep the Hudson . But the Huskies could n't answer at the end and finally the two leaders rolled home through the last half mile , locked together like wrestlers in as great a finish as the course has ever seen . Half-Length Ahead of Navy . Washington was about two lengths behind the leaders at the finish , and a half-length ahead of a game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roaring pace the two leaders were setting . A length and a half back came Syracuse and there was considerable open water between it and Penn and Columbia , the Lions two and a half lengths behind the Philadelphians . Washington 's brilliant freshman crew had taken the first race in a great exhibition , and Washington 's junior varsity , the all-sophomore crew which had won the freshman race here last year , came through to a smashing victory in 16 event . Then , when the Washington crew rode out in front and stayed there in the last race , it seemed that there would be a clean sweep . Conditions were excellent for the oarsmen , though distinctly unpleasant for the spectators . The result was a smaller crowd than any of recent years . There were only about 25,000 who braved the recurring showers and mists and the cold , gray afternoon that made top coats comfortable . But they were rewarded by a blistering fight between two of the best eights the Hudson has ever seen . The time of the winners-18:52-is the second best winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds the record of 18:354-5 , set by the first of her great Olympic champions in 1928 . The victory meant the championship stayed with California . It has been three times in a row now that the men from the Golden Gate have taken the highest honors of their branch of intercollegiate rowing , in 1932 , when they went on to take their second Olympic championship , and again last year after the regatta had been dropped for a season . Truly California stands at the top of college rowing . Challenges the Bears . That last half mile , for sheer , fighting drama , has never been matched . Cornell had moved up to challenge California coming under the three-mile bridge . The Ithacans were only about five feet away when they entered the last half mile , and the pair slammed down this , Cornell rowing close to 39 and California almost as high , while the crowd on the boats and the observation train roared itself hoarse . Into the last few feet they raced , and into a deafening din of whistles from excursion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big steamers careening drunkenly with the crowd against the nearest rail . They stopped rowing almost together over the finish and for a full three minutes the followers of both staged a wild celebration , for Cornell men were as certain their crew had won as were the California adherents . Finally the judges announced officially that the West had held its laurels , but there were almost as loud cheers for the runners-up as for the winners when they paddled back home , sitting up straight and waving back at the crowd . California had proved itself a true champion , but certainly Cornell earned the right to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Westerners . The day broke over Poughkeepsie sullen and wet , with an amazing change in temperature . Last night the only cool persons in town were the oarsmen down in their camps by the river . Finally rain began and the temperature fell until this morning it was more like a football day than a June morning . Held back by the threat of the weather , the crowd was slow arriving . For quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help the local police , stood idly with only normal traffic to handle . It was noon before the rush set in and the city gradually took on its excited , crammed air of race-day . Light Clothing Absent . Instead of light Summer clothes , though , there were dark overcoats and umbrellas and the usual seeking of odd methods of protection against the weather . One group raided a store for kitchen oil cloth and walked around the streets in weird , pink colored hoods ; another bought tar paper at the lumber yard and fashioned long raincoats of Down stream on the river it was surprisingly calm . The boats had not come up in great numbers and above the two and one-half mile mark only an occasional Coast Guard cutter drifted at anchor , waiting to police the river in the afternoon . The rain had done its work with the water that a wild wind kicked up into a small sea last night . The old course lay sleepily under the low sky , its surface looking like a mirror . Occasionally a coaching boat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river , and one or two crews , looking amazingly small in the big stream , took final paddles . But the river , Upstream , was almost deserted , almost lonely looking . Up at the Navy camp there was the excitement of gold-braided officers dropping in to give their crews a pat on the back before the start of the racing . At most of the camps , old oarsmen were on hand , smelling again the smoke of battle . Only at California was it empty . California lived in its boathouse this year and California is a long way off for old graduates . The long dining table , set up in the boat shed alongside the shells , was ready for the last meals these men would have before they found the answer to why they had come across the continent . At each place was a tall glass of orange juice . On the porch upstairs a few sat in chairs and pretended to read newspapers . Downstairs , alone except for the watchman , was Gene Berkenkamp , who was to write his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river has seen . He stood barefooted with hands in the pockets of long dungaree trousers . He rocked back and forth on his heels , whistling a tuneless melody . Berkenkamp was finding it hard to wait . Uptown at noon , the streets had become jammed and a steady procession of cars slithered over the soaked pavement . The lobbies of the hotels were crowded , with nobody sitting down . The mob descended suddenly into the restaurants and then , just as suddenly , began the alpine descent down the cliff-like Main Street to the river . End of Dock Roped Off . The Main Street dock was jammed again . One end was roped off , with sailors on guard to see that only the holders of passes for the destroyer at the finish got through . Alongside were the dozens of small boats that bargained for passengers , their owners hoarse with shouting . Finally they started away . The river had become crowded since the morning . The last mile was jammed with boats , great , lowering excursion steamers and the big Coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line and scurrying about . Bobbing wildly in the wakes they were helping to kick up , were the hundreds of little craft suddenly busy with ferrying thousands who had decided simultaneously to reach the other side of the river . The observation train lay almost empty at the finish , waiting for its load . The rain had stopped for a while , but sullen-looking , puffy clouds moved rapidly , low over the course . The Hendrik Hudson on her regular trip downstream pulled from her pier and picked her way carefully downstream and out of sight . Out on the course , the traffic slowly died and the course dropped as the tide turned and the time for the freshman race drew nearer . Washington 's brilliant freshmen pulled away from their float and headed upstream to the start , fragile looking in the midst of all the big craft . ' A last frantic ferry , her decks black with onlookers , came across from Poughkeepsie , the train whistled once and started upstream . The waiting had ended for the oarsmen . They were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they were ready for each race . In addition to being one of the most exciting of years , the regatta was also one of the best run , each race starting almost exactly at the time planned for it . Syracuse at Stake Boat . Syracuse already was at its stake boat . The others moved into line . An airplane or two , waiting to rush pictures to New York , soared in the black-looking , bumpy air . With very little delay the veteran Julian Curtiss sent the crews away and the regatta was on . It was n't very long before the Washington eight took command , and it was in complete command throughout the last part of the race . The story was almost repeated in the next race , except that Navy finished second instead of California . But in neither case did the second-place crew really threaten the leaders at the finish . The train stopped once more after this race to take on a few belated ticket holders and then bounced back up the full four miles past Columbia 's boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crews were already there , waiting , and Syracuse and Cornell were paddling up . The rain ceased again just as they were jockeying to their stake boats and a fine mist blanketed the city down below , four miles away , making it look like a weird mirage in a desert , but conditions were rxcellent out on the river . They were n't long at the start before the high-pitched voice of Referee Curtiss asked them if they were ready . There was a hand or two in the air and for the next moment or so , in the tense silence that the start always brings , the metallic voices of coxswains giving orders came through to the crown . Then Mr. Curtiss 's voice again and the bark of the starting gun . Bunched at the Start . The crews went away as though that gun bad fired all seven of them from the same rifle . For a hundred yards and more there was no leader . Then slowly Washington came out to the lead . But it was very little of a lead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington eight settled down from its first minute of row , ing to about 32 , and most of the leading crews rowed that pace through most of the race , sometimes a little higher , sometimes a little slower . At the half-mile mark Washington led by four feet and Syracuse was in second place , just ahead of Navy . Cornell and California were waiting in the wings for the first part of the play to develop and leave them the centre of the stage . Cornell was the first of the two eventual leaders to move up to chalI lenge . In the next half mile the Red went to third place , with Washington leading by a half length over Syracuse . Cornell was within a half ' length there , but California was still hanging back . In the next half mile it appeared that Washington was certainly going to repeat . The Huskies moved ahead to their greatest lead of the day , a bit of open water showing for them at the end of the third half mile , with Syracuse still in second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Leaders . California was creeping and was only a few feet behind Syracuse . It had caught and passed Cornell . Immediately , Cornell demonstrated it was not going to be out of it until the end . Washington still had three quarters of a length lead at the end of the second mile , but Cornell had come back to second place , a half length ahead of California . The race then began to belong to the leaders . Navy had stayed well up in it  --  at the two miles there was n't four lengths difference between the last crews . But Penn and Columbia began dropping back and then , slowly , foot by foot , Syracuse and Navy faded , leaving the lead to the other three , though they were certainly not definitely out of it until the last mile . It was the third mile that saw California at last begin to move ahead with the assurance and poise of a champion . At two and a half miles , Washington had only ten feet of its lead left , and on either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inch they went by and the race was theirs when they flashed out of sight under the railroad bridge at the three-mile mark . Cornell led there by a few feet and California had a half length on Washington . Then came that amazing last mile . For a while at the start of that fourth mile it seemed that Syracuse and the Navy would come up to take Washington . But the Huskies managed to stand that off . But it was only Cornell that was bothering California now . Asks for Higher Stroke . First Hart , Cornell 's stroke , asked for a higher beat and Berkenkamp had to answer it with California . It was impossible to tell through the last half mile most of the time which crew was leading . California seemed to build up almost a half length lead , only to have Cornell come back to take it away . And when they had finished the Hudson had seen two gallant and two great crews row its famous course .

From the head California ( nearest camera ) beating Cornell , Washington , Navy and Syracuse . Due to the deceptive angle the Ithaca eight appears to be leading . Times Wide World Photo .
