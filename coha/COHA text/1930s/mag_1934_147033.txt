She waited until her 3-month-old child Harold partly emptied his bottle . Then Mrs. Watson Patrick tucked him in his crib under the tree at the edge of the tomato patch , wiped dribble from his lips , and left him for an hour to help her husband cultivate the vines . Unobserved by the Patricks , shack-living tenant farmers of Bells , Tenn. , when they placed the child 's crib on the ground , was a red ant hill . Nor did Mother Patrick notice that her son 's milk bottle was leaking on the coverlet , dripping to the ground . <P> Foraging ants found the milk drippings , scurried back to the ant hill with the tidings . When Mrs. Patrick returned from the tomato patch , the crib , the coverlet , Harold 's head were a rusty-red quiver . The baby was unconscious . Doctors thought that he might recover from the ant-bite poison ( formic acid ) . But the red ants , like the all-devouring soldier ants which terrorize tropical Asia , had nipped the sight from one eye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
