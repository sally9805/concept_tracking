VOYAGE FROM MOJI A STORY BY LIONEL WIGGAM rpm. midnight and after , the girl lin-geredd at the ship 's rail . On its mountainside the village of Moji became a cup of light with a pale pavilion swelling over it . All Japan resolved presently to a few luminous rocks that tapered up , ever so often , like the spires of a drowned city . The young woman at the rail had taken off her hat . For two hours after sailing she had remained at the stern , watching the waves gather and expire , their twisted rims breaking like porcelain and scattering to the night . When she moved at last to go inside she was chilled body and mind ; her teeth chattered as she gave her cabin number and followed a steward down the steep hill of stairs . A woman , lifting silver-stoppered bottles from a valise that was unfolded on one of the berths , wheeled round with a gasp as the girl closed the door . " Ohl " she said , wrapping her negligee over her breast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who it was , she burst into rippling laughter . " My dear , how you frightened me ! " she cried . " I thought you were one of the cabin boys . " " Sorry , " the girl said . She sat on the other berth , drawing the sleeves of her sweater down about her wrists for warmth . " I 'd have knocked , " she said without smiling , " but I thought I was to have this cabin by myself . " The woman in negligee , an Englishwoman by her diction , closed the lid of her valise and gave it a little push , making room for herself to sit down . She smelled faintly of lilacs and she had a bright , immediate smile which she offered without reserve . " It 's a nuisance , " she said warmly , " but on these Maru boats even honeymooners ca n't hope to be alone : my husband , you know , must occupy a horrid close little room with four other gentlemen . So we 're quite lucky , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scanning the rather sweeping features of the girl , " we 're really quite lucky , having just the two of us here . " " I see . " The compressed line of the girl 's mouth was released a little . " I guess we are , at that . It 's a shame though , " she said , " that you and your husband must be separated . You 're on your honeymoon , you say ? " The Englishwoman leaned back on her elbows . " My dear child ! " she blurted ; then , impulsively , she flung back the lid of her valise . " You did n't understand . I just said that to  --  why , we 've been married twenty years , the Major and I ! " She drew out a photograph . " That 's my husband , Major Hague . He 'll be so  --  so amused ! " And her arch , smiling mouth parted again with laughter . The girl laughed too , joylessly . She handed back the photograph and got up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she took her bag  --  brown imitation leather with large brass seals  --  from the cabin floor and laid it on her berth . " Billie 's my real name , " she added deliberately ; " not a nickname . And I 'm not married , " she stated , after the pause while she turned a key in the lock , " but I 'm en-gaged . " After rummaging beneath some lingerie , she turned with the color swelling high up in her face and handed the older woman a snapshot . " That 's my fiance , Mrs. Hayes , or whatever-your-name-is , " she declared ; and in her dread of being patronized , her voice flew to an unnatural register . " His name 's Philip Wang . His father was a peasant . " " We/11 " faltered Mrs. Hague . Her ease was shatteringly disrupted . There was downright hatred in the girl 's voice ; it quavered perilously on the brink of tears . " Well , my dear , " Mrs. Hague said uncertainly again , " he 's ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The girl jerked a jar of cold cream from her bag . " Because he is n't , I know that . But he is intelligent and he 's decent , and things like that . " She pulled her sweater over her head and hurled it on the bed . " The hell with it ! " she broke off harshly and turned to the mirror , unscrewing the lid of the jar and slapping the bleached lathery substance on her face . Mrs. Hague , gone a little pale , gathered her tremulous resources and rose . Taking the girl gently by the shoulders , she turned her round . " Really , my dear , " she said softly , " there 's no need for you to behave like this . How I 've antagonized you I do n't know  --  I honestly do n't know I  --  but I 'd like very much to be friends with you . We 're going to share this little room three days , you know . " The girl 's hands were so agitated that she dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the berths , " It 's just , " she returned acridly , " that I want you to know whom you 're rooming with . If you do , we can go on from there . " She tried to turn back to the mirror . " But such a way , " sighed Mrs. Hague , " such a way to tell me about yourself1 " She smiled engagingly , giving the girl 's shoulder a little pat . " Choosing a husband , " she said , " I 've always said , is like choosing a hat  --  there 's no accounting for tastes . One woman likes something chichi ; another prefers something plain , or something like mine ? pinkish and rather swollen with a tendency to jowls . In any case , the thing is whether the hat you 've chosen pleases you ! If you think it 's most becoming , if it helps you walk down the street with a certain dash  --  that 's the thing , is n't it ? " She smiled again persuasively , giving the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , child  --  Billie , you do n't mind if I call you Billie ? They may criticize your taste , as I 'm sure they do mine , but they ca n't hate you because you prefer yellow to pink . Why , I 've lived in the Orient for three years .. . " " And some of your best friends are married to Chinese , I suppose ? " " That 's perfectly true , " replied Mrs. Hague agreeably . " In fact , my husband 's niece is married to an East Indian who 's one of the most distinguished scholars in his field . " This little invention she murmured with complete candor , and on the strength of it released the girl to turn to her valise for a cigarette . " Wo n't you have one with me ? " she invited winningly . " Thanks . " Miss Foster resumed her position in front of the mirror , dragging deeply at the cigarette and brushing back her hair , certain strands of it pale yellow against the brown where the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I owe you an apology , Mrs. ? " " My friends call me Frances . Wo n't you ? " " Well , Frances . But if you knew ? " She was determined to speak in nothing like a whine ; her voice went cold again . " If you knew how I 've got it from every side  --  from everybody , my mother even . After all , since I 'm doing it for her , it 's been ? " " I take it then , " intercepted Mrs. Hague , leaning back on one elbow and blowing out the smoke in a fan , " I take it you do n't love this young man ? " The girl sat down on her berth and began stripping off her stockings . " I suppose I do . " " Then you 're marrying him , " said Mrs. Hague softly , " because you want to , because you must . Not for your mother nor for any other reason . " " That 's right . " She dropped her stockings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hague lay back too , her cigarette dangling from her lips , giving car to the girl 's voice and trying to establish the tenor of it , noting how preposterously this hardness shone from her eyes  --  how absurd was the entire personality which the girl tried to assume like a garment the wrong shape , the least flattering color . " Listen , " she said presently , " why do n't you tell me about it ? " The girl stared at her ; desolate and frail and ill-used she looked : a girl with an immense amount of sun-streaked hair and tired eyes  --  an appealing air of being vulnerably young . " It 's so hard , " she replied effortfully , " to say what you mean . " " There , do try . " The bruised expression , the false , inscrutable light went from her eyes ; she flung her cigarette into the wash basin . " Well , two years ago , " she began , quietly enough , " I left the town where I lived to enter the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she added with the first charming indication that she knew how to smile , " but that 's what I am  --  a co-ed , not a chorus girl ! Anyway , " she resumed , " that first term I had to get through the worst way  --  waiting table , washing dishes , even scrubbing floors . That was all right . I did n't mind working hard . It was the snobbery , " she explained , staring at her hands , " the other girls  --  not wanting me for their sororities , giggling at the clothes I had to wear . " She glanced up . " You would n't know about that . " Well , " she said , " I got good grades . And the second year I began to tutor people in math . I was good at math . I might have been a certified accountant or something if I 'd gone on . Anyway , this Philip Wang , he was one of the students I tutored . His father has been a peasant in Shansi ( he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had bought up lots of land . He got very rich , and Philip came to America for an education . " The girl breathed deeply , pulling her feet up on the berth and lying back with her head on the pillow . " Philip was a nice boy . I liked being with him  --  he had more sense than the average college man . Once in a while he 'd bring me flowers or something . At Christmas , you know , he wanted to give me an expensive jade bracelet he 'd sent to Shanghai for . I would n't take it of course . He could n't understand , but from then on I kept our relationship on the academic basis . No more flowers or candy or anything else . " Then , " she said , " my father  --  he was a mechanic  --  my father was killed . He 'd been working in an interurban terminal ; one of the cars crushed his back . There was insurance for the funeral expenses but nothing left over to support my mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quit school and go to work , because mother was an invalid ; she needed special care and things . " " So Philip Wang , " put in Mrs. Hague , " Philip loaned you the money and you were able to stay in college ? " " That 's right . He insisted . I did n't even have to explain about it  --  I could tell he was lending me the money because he admired me  --  not because he wanted me . Though he did that too , " she amended . " Not long after my father died he proposed to me . " " The thing is you accepted him , " persisted Mrs. Hague brightly , " because you loved himl " " No . I might have loved him , I was n't sure , but I did n't want to marry him while we were there in the States . You know how it would be . I told him I 'd have to think it over . Before I could decide , his father sent for him to come home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Over a year . Last June the doctor told me I 'd have to take my mother out West . There was only one place I knew to get money . 1 wrote Philip , and I said I 'd come to him . " The girl turned on her side and stared searchingly at Mrs. Hague . " That makes me sound saintlike . It 's not that way at all . When I see Philip , " she cried in a rush , " I may find I 'm really in love with him  --  I could n't have done it if I had n't thought thatl And then it 'll be different in China . " " Oh , I think so , " said Mrs. Hague with her unique comprehension . She fished a tin from her valise . " I really dol Do you like toffee ? I bought some lovely toffee in a shop in Tokio ? " The girl 's eyes seemed to be fixed through and beyond her . " He 's never kissed me , " she concluded . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , when Mrs. Hague put her nose over the top step of the companionway , she saw they were to have a blue , flawless day , and from the rail she gazed out across the sea , waiting for her husband and watching the little islands slip by . This is the kind of day that will make me long for England , she thought wistfully : picnics are being planned over the porridge on a day like this ; garden parties will be given for women prettier than the flowers ; old ladies will cast off their shawls and young men will stride bareheaded down Piccadilly . The whole island will emerge from the fogs , like a jewel plucked out of cotton . But her husband was a collector ; he adored the Orient . In Peking they would stay till certain T'ang figures were unearthed , and then it would be Japan , where they had just been for a brief vacation , and after that China again , or Bali , No  --  England was a long way away . She began thinking about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . Although her sleep was always profound , Mrs. Hague had dreamed about Billie Foster . She had fancied herself asthat girl and she had fancied being met at Tangku by a young Chinese she had never seen before , being taken off to some unholy province with an outdoor privy , while the Major stamped up and down the wharf , searching and shouting for her . It seemed quite dreadful at the time , but now she thrust her arms out over the rail and laughed . At that moment she was kissed on the nape of the neck . " Major . " Her husband kissed her again , rather more passionately on the mouth , and then he kept his head lowered while she wiped off the rouge . Mrs. Hague felt a glow of consideration , asking him about his own experiences before she confided hers . " Two American officers from Manila , " reported the Major sourly , " and two Japanese . That meant of course closed portholes. 1 spent the whole night trying to breathe shallowly and counting the germs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As a matter of fact , he looked singularly fresh , but as Mrs. Hague had told the young woman from America , he was spoiled . She had erred , however , in declaring him swollen  --  that had been to press home her point ; for , as many of her Peking friends declared , Major Hague was a fine , hearty figger of a man . " How about you ? " demanded the Major . " But of course , " he added reproachfully , " you had a Class A , did n't you ? " " I ? I was perfectly comfortable . But Major , " she said , lowering her voice with import , " the most extraordinary girl is sharing my cabin . Really extraordinary . I do want you to talk to her . " " English ? You 're not going to ask her to visit us , Frances ? " " American , and she 's not going to Peking ; she is going to Shansi . She 's engaged to a young Chinese out there . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , Majorl You 've met heaps and heaps of perfectly charming girls who-darling , there 's no accounting for tastes . As I 've always said , it 's like choosing a hat . " " Yes , I know , " said the Major . " Just the same . " He broke into his whistle again . Mrs. Hague decided to leave it at that . They had been pacing up and down the deck , and as they came to the stern once more , she looked out at the long wrinkled avenues of foam . " Is n't it exciting ? " she said , squeezing her husband 's arm . " The beginning of a voyage , I mean ? Even a short one . There 's such a feeling of unsolved secrets and things unsaid . It 's as if life all together is right here on a little blob of wood rocking about on the waves ! So that the only important relationships , " she pursued intently , " are with these people  --  how you 're going to stand watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth at night . I 've read that lots of times , " she confessed earnestly , " but it never seems quite true till one 's actually ? " " After all , " protested Major Hague , " I have to watch four pairs , four sets of teeth being brushed , while you 've only one . Moreover , I do n't think I could endure closed portholes for more than a year . " " What I mean , Major , is that when I 'm on a boat and there 's nothing but good , clean water all around , and the mud 's left behind with all the hideous tittle houses on it , I want to be kinder than I ever was before , Major . I do n't want to tell lies . It 's like beginning all over again with people who do n't know how awful you are and the vile things you 've done . It ? " " It would be extremely awful of you , " chuckled the Major , " practically vile , in fact , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , dear , " mourned Mrs. Hague as they followed the waiter , " they 've put us at a table for two . I did n't want to be by ourselves  --  I wanted to be at the purser 's table with the others . " " There is n't room . " Major Hague polished his silver with satisfaction . " And will you look at ' em , my dear ? I 'd rather be at the captain 's table with the Japanese . Where are these people you 're going to be so kind and honest with ? The same old characters out of Punch  --  schoolmistresses from America , army officers from Manila whose wives have eaten too many bananas . You 've got too fanciful while we 've been in the Orient , Frances . " " Yes , " agreed Mrs. Hague , definitely let down , " they are n't very unusual . I fancy Miss Foster is having her breakfast downstairs . You 'll like her , Major , she has a certain quality . " " Oh , I daresay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an orange . " A certain quality nobody else wants . " While the Major in his steamer chair spent the hours writing in a journal ( he had kept a journal since a boy of ten ) , Mrs. Hague moved like a bright and murmurous light over all the ship . There was a bridge game in the dining saloon where Mrs. Hague lost generously , would have lost indefinitely had not her partner with unnecessary sharpness excused herself . Then Mrs. Hague discovered diverting Japanese children in the steerage ( who thought her altogether a nuisance , tolerating her through sheer politeness ) who played games which Mrs. Hague organized . Since the morning had not broken its promise but had ballooned out on every side with mild crescent waves and a profoundly blue sky , there was the view from the rail . Mrs. Hague spent several hours here , bending her face to the water and thinking intently about a number of things . The murmur of water made her contemplative , and her mind would dart from gay chimeras of the child , round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth , that she and the Major would one day adopt , to the ribs of ships and peeled bones and monsters in green draperies floating over the floor of the sea . Her imagination could change the drabbest fact to something utterly delightful : with her bright mind she put jewels in its hair and ribbons on its wrists , set . an arc of pure glamour like a shawl round its shoulders . But it was the girl , Billie Foster , who absorbed her most . Somehow Mrs. Hague felt responsibility toward that girl  --  first because she had won the girl 's confidences , even more because she was scarcely past twenty and forlorn , while she , Mrs. Hague , had over forty years behind her of undiminished contentment . . . . It was true that anything Mrs. Hague was told , spoken urgently or with a trembling lip , she accepted as truth . Like many people who are mistaken for downright fools , she was simply innocent and responsive . Unlike many clever ones , she liked people neither with suspicion nor remorse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Major 's cigar , tucked his rug round him , kissed him rather guiltily , and went below , repeating a plan triumphantly under her breath . The plan had to wait . Except for once when she had been washing her hair , Billie Foster was asleep , as she had slept all the day , her hair like a profusion of copper coins burdening the pillow , her young body curled on the berth much as if it had been dropped there ( so mused Mrs. Hague ) from the jaws of some monstrous beast . As the girl had explained , she had traveled third class all the way across Japan , sitting up at night on the train and sleeping scarcely at alt . It was her intention , she had declared , to spend most of these three days catching up . " To keep from thinking , poor child , " sighed Mrs. Hague . But it was a disappointment . " It can wait . To-morrow will do , " the Major 's wife comforted herself , and rather sadly began to take off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refreshed and singularly calm , lying as she was on the deep , protective breast of a ship with the engines throbbing like a heart beneath her . She sat up on her berth , pushing back from her shoulders the weight of her hair andstretching out her arms as if there were something to embrace . The Englishwoman had gone up to breakfast , and Billie put her feet on the grass mat and gazed out through the porthole . The mild salt breeze blew in , lifting and laving her hair . Outside , the deck stretched like a piazza to the rail , gaunt birds beyond it balanced on the wind , bleating their little cries and letting fall their drops of silt into the water . Billie turned back before the minor , releasing the straps of her nightdress and gazing with pride on the upright torch of her body . She regarded it as a very core of strength , unyielding and indomitable , willing to do what it must without complaint ; she sang as she sponged herself and smiled into the mirror to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing  --  she had flung it like an insult at the Englishwoman the first evening out , and then , for the initial time , shaped it wonderingly into words . There was one thing , perpetually looming and threatening her composure like a faint , dark haze on a clear horizon . But often , as now , she could look through or above it , even blow it like a feather from the landscape entirely . She was young or healthy enough to think any unpleasant . ness , not present or too urgently ahead , could never occur at all  --  as one invites boring people in a flush of good will to lunch , feeling confident that the date set , a week away , is too remote ever actually to come round . After she was dressed and powdered she walked up the steps and down the passage , keeping the walls , when the boat lurched a little , erect with her hands . The passengers had gone on deck , and in the dining saloon were only the waiters who brushed by with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her coffee the room surrounded her in a sort of beauty . There was sunlight so pure and strong it seemed almost to burst the glass , while round the corners poured the air from the sea ; on the table were honey and cigarettes and nuts and pomolo fruit , that could be peeled like a fig and unfolded from the skin like a flower . After she had eaten she went on deck , circling it a dozen times before she stopped at the rail . The steerage children were playing games ; among them was a woman with graying braids pinned up about her ears and a handkerchief at her nose to revive her from the smells  --  a matron who proved to he the Englishwoman , Mrs. Hague , making rules and explaining with gestures the game of tag . " Major ! " she began to shout , gazing up imploringly at a gentleman who was whistling and enjoying the sun farther down the rail . " Major , what 's the Japanese for ? " Then she saw Billie , and her mouth curved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and about to-day , " she called brightly . " Major ! that 's Miss Foster . My husband , Major Hague ! " There was nothing whatever to do . Billie was overcome with shyness and she recoiled at this intrusion on her mood . She merely nodded and started to walk away . But the gentleman down the rail had stopped whistling and came striding toward her . " Well , how do you do ? " he said almost truculently . " Oh , " said Billie , and she clapped her hand to her hair , not to save it from the wind but to hide her eyes which were watering with embarrassment . " How do you do ? " They shook hands awkwardly while the Englishwoman 's laughter rippled below them and her handkerchief fluttered on the wind . Major Hague , a big fresh-colored person with sturdy shoulders , nodded at Billie several times and turned to gaze down at his wife . " That game she 's teaching ' em , whadayacallit , tag . " He spoke in a rolling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have heard of it . " " I thought everybody , " responded Billie nervously , " all children , in all countries , played tag . " Major Hague broke into a whistle , broke off again , and snorted with laugh-ter . " They 're just humoring her . I daresay they know the game perfectly . The Japanese have excellent manners . " " I wish I 'd got to know them better  --  I had to come right through Japan . " Then she blushed , wondering , as she felt him looking at her , what his wife had told him  --  if perhaps he scorned her a little ? " I wonder what it is , " she thought , " that makes Englishmen so clean ? All that fog and rain , you 'd think they 'd grow up damp as moss . " And such pride as they had : Major Hague 's chin held so high , his blue eyes gazing out blind and bloodless like a portrait of the king 's  --  the stamp and seal of empire set upon him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The thing is , they 're not a trustworthy people ! " declared the Major sharply , as if she had spoken these things aloud . " They 're short-tempered and aggressive . Give me a Chinese every ? " He halted ; a resounding silence fell with the ship 's noises crowding soft and assertive between them . She could tell by his hands , closing and unclosing on the rail , that he knew ; that he was ashamed for knowing and for what he 'd said . Instead of feeling outraged , she felt sickeningly sorry for him , almost like apologizing . It was Mrs. Hague , gay and young , ravishing with the sunshine in her hair , who saved everything ; they might have gone painfully on standing there forever . " The most charming children in the world ! " she cried joyously , climbing the flight of steps . " Do let 's find deck chairs . They 're charming but they 've exhausted me . And the odor down there ! " She shuddered delicately , putting her handkerchief to her nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between them , facing the swinging expanse of sea , Billie was acutely conscious of them both . Surely there was never a woman so gracious or lovely as this Englishwoman with her loose gray braids and shapely hands and the diction that came tempered with British love and kindness from her throat . And the man with his sanguine , somewhat bewildered face at finding this stranger inserted between them  --  had ever a man at home such splendid clear eyes , such immaculate cuffs with the gold links clasping them , and the fingers beneath square and clean ? These things impressed her sadly . It was as if the only fear she had , for what there was before her , was that she might never see people like these again . . . . The Hagues began to speak of their house in Peking , and Billie listened with a quiet sadness , not envying them at all but held in dolorous wonder that there could be people for whom money was lavish as grass , who had been taught nothing of meagerness , who could devote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mei Mei , just before we left  --  our Tibetan  --  died , so the vet said , because I fed her cream puffs , " grieved Mrs. Hague . " It was too dreadful  --  to know that one had deliberately killed a little dog . Lame old men and dogs I simply ca n't resist , " she confided simply , " and cruelty to animals I ca n't forgive . " " When I was ten years old I sat on a frog , " said Billie eagerly , pleased to contribute something . " It was awful , my first awareness of death . I was fat though ; it died instantly . " " It is n't very wise , " the Major 's voice suddenly resounded from his coat collar , " to become attached to ' em , pets , I mean . Their life span 's so much shorter than one 's own . Unless one chooses turtles or toads ; they live forever . " " But imagine , " cried Mrs. Hague in dismay , " imagine sleeping with a toad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed ; I do believe we were equally devoted . And she forgave me when she died . She was shivering uncontrollably , but she gave me a lovely long stare and swooned away in a series of little shudders . You 'll see where we buried her , Billie  --  under the wisteria arbor where . . . " She stopped and put her hand on her husband 's arm . " Major , you must n't let us keep you from your journal . " The Major struggled up from his steamer chair , looking more bewilderedthan ever . He nodded shortly to Billie and walked whistling away . " Now ! " said Mrs. Hague , turning in her deck chair and folding her hands so that above the blue veins the Chinese bracelets , bound round her wrists , clattered up and down . " Now , " she said , and her voice was quiet with kindness , " I have a little plan , Billie , that I want to suggest to you . " Billie stared back , the blood swarming up into her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ godly creature might evoke . " It 's true , " said Mrs. Hague in apology , " we dock at Tangku to-morrow morning , and there is n't much time for you to think about it . But if there 's any doubt in your mind , " she said in her most urgent voice , tapping Billie 's arm with her painted fingertips , " if there 's any doubt at all , I do think you 'd be wise to think this over . " Billie sat very still , indeed powerless to move at all . It was as if a door in her mind , never guessed at , had suddenly been flung open , and at the Englishwoman 's signal she might gaze out presently across vistas of unsurmisable charm . " For a long time , " explained Mrs. Hague , " for all the three years we 've been in Peking , I 've been simply dying to do a book on Chinese etiquette . The only thing is , I ca n't write for more than fifteen minutes without paralyzing my forefinger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's absolutely no one to be got in Peking . I thought , " she said , poking at a hairpin and smiling her warmest smile , " that if you 'd care to he our house guest while we work on this book , you and I  --  it would take about a year , I should think ? that thirty dollars a week . . . Then , you see , my dear , " she concluded triumphantly , " you could save practically all that and you could pay back that young man what you 've borrowed from him ! " The miracle was overpowering in its simplicity ; Billie sat up with her hands so agitated she hid them in her coat . " It 's true , " she said wildly , " that I type quite well . I could begin in longhand till my typewriter came from home ? " " Of course you could , " responded Mrs. Hague ; " you think about it . I 'm sure you 'll see . . . " She patted the girl 's arm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billie , looking after her thought she did a waltz down the deck . During the afternoon the waves were flattened yellow as isinglass by a pressure that began with dense heat and compelled clouds to inch , glacier-wise , down the sky . The slightest noise on the ship became significant as a chime in the annihilation of sound around it ; at first the rain came , with each drop falling cleanly and singly ; then the lightning cracked out like whips , and the wind came smacking down against the water . Rain swept over the decks in a tide . In the suddenly darkened alleyways the passengers moved uneasily , bearing up the walls with their elbows ; after dinner some collected for comfort under the glaring lights of the saloon ; others shrank pale with nausea into their berths . Mrs. Hague was among these , and Billie Foster brushed back the gray plaits and put cologne on the pale forehead till she dozed apologetically away . Then , with the spine of the ship twisting and stretching on the rack of that tumult , Billie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain rushed in directly she stepped out the door , but it was reviving and welcome after the closeness of the cabin . She pushed to the rail , gripping it and staring down at the waves , tossing their heads like cattle . Next moment the ship plunged sickeningly ; she was wrenched away fierce as a leaf in a spring gale , and she would have been hurled back against the door , had not two arms in a mackintosh caught her neatly about the waist and half-propelled , half-carried her along to the glassed-in portion of the deck . It was Major Hague , buttoned to the throat in his mackintosh , a muffler wound twice round his neck ; above it his pale , thin  --  lidded eye recognized her disapprovingly . " You should n't be out in this storm ! " he shouted at her , and his voice like a deep bell echoed in that narrow space . " The whole damned boat , " he resumed in his deliberate voice , " the whole damned thing 's as ineffectual as a mollusk when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked out through the glass so that in profile a sudden fork of lightning carved out his cheek , the bold nostrils , the dark , shaven bone of his jaw . " Your wife 's feeling better , " ventured Billie timidly , when she 'd caught her breath . " After she went to sleep , it was so hot down there I ? " " I do n't believe in seasickness , " the Major volunteered sharply , turning his pale eyes down on her . " I do n't believe in it ! " he said , staring at her as if in accusation . " The thing is , keep your mind off the motion , " he said , " keep your mind as level as always and your stomach ca n't play tricks ! " " Oh , yes , " Billie said quickly , clapping her hands to her hair and pressing her toes against the planks . " That 's the thing , " she agreed , " the only way to avoid it . " He waved toward the chaos beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do n't feel it ? " he said , and perhaps it was the vigor in his veins , the assertion of health and life , that set a warm banner of color flying on his cheekbones " ? any fool knows that going up and down in a lift could turn his stomach if he let it . It 's a lot worse , " he concluded loudly , as if to convince her , " a thing like this is a lot worse . . . " Then he swung round as if in loathing , and his body crushed her back against the wall ; since there were no words to say , his eyes blazed down at her after they had kissed , his body hard against the waterlogged weight that hers had become , the mark of his beard still smarting on her face . " Well , " he said hoarsely , " you 're corn-ing to live with us , " he said , and the muffler seemed to strangle his voice . The storm which they had abandoned came pounding against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billie pushed him away and ran down the deck . There was mist and a thin rain the next morning , but the sea was calm . Everyone crowded to the rail to see the fishermen , the mud houses , and the little boats with ribbed sails that unfolded like fans . Mrs. Hague , her head wrapped in a veil , came on deck from breakfast , She searched both decks for Billie Foster and found her under the glassed-in portion of the deck where one could watch the wharf without being seen . " You really should have had break-fast , " she told her chidingly , pressing her arm . " It 's dangerous eating on the train , because they may not wash their vegetables . It 'll be hours till we get to Peking . " " No , I seldom eat breakfast . " " Then you must learn to , dear , " said Mrs. Hague , winding the veil snugly round her braids . " You 're much tooohi " she broke off suddenly , and wheeled in excitement to the rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be here ! D' you recognize him , Billie ? All the Chinese still look alike to me , I fearl " The girl , rather flushed , buttoned up her raincoat . " Of course I recognize him . He 's standing by that pile of rope , the man in the blue  --  the blue robe or whatever you call it , those things they wear . He does n't see ? " " Now , you must say , " directed Mrs. Hague vaguely , " that you 've decided to visit us in Peking for a few weeks . Then you can write him all about it . It 'll be quite easy , dear ; our train is leaving just as soon as we 're through the customs . " The girl put her hands in the pockets of her coat and turned to Mrs. Hague almost angrily . " But you 've misunderstood , " she said ; " I did n't say I 'd come with you ; you did n't understand at all . " Mrs. Hague stared at her in astonishment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she stammered , " I thought , I thought you ? " " Of course I 'm going to marry Philip , " said the girl implacably ; " that 's what I came for , that 's why I 'm here . " " But if you do n't love him . " The Englishwoman was in tears . " I do . At least I do n't know that I do n't . No , really , you 've ? " At that moment the Major came up the companionway . He took off his hat rather stiffly when he saw them . " Please do n't think , " blurted the girl to Mrs. Hague , " that I 'm ungrateful . I 'm not , and you 've tried to be awfully kind . But you must learn , " she said almost savagely , " not to interfere with other people 's lives ! " She brushed past Major Hague and ran down the companionway . " Major , " cried Mrs. Hague . She waved her hands in the air as if something must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hear ? I know she intended to come with us . I  --  I ca n't understand . . . " She began to weep distractedly , and he put his arm around her . " Never mind , " he said . The whistle began to blow , and the ropes rushed out to clasp the wharf . " Do n't be hurt , dearest , " he said , " she was a common little thing . She might 've run off with my finest jade . " He gave his - wife his handkerchief and bent down to kiss the.palepink brows under her hair . " There 's no telling , " he said firmly , " what might have happened , " and he kissed her again . For he loved her , really , very much , and he hated to see her cry .
