Up into the rugged Huasteca hills of the central Mexican State of San Luis Potos one day last week thundered Federal cavalry forces of President Lzaro Crdenas . At the town of Rio Verde they found belligerent bands of agrarian soldiers , members of the private army of San Luis Potos 's General Saturnine Cedillo . Soon 22 agrarians lay dead , 15 wounded and 80 more were being rounded up as prisoners . But defiantly , 75 miles away , a lone Cedillista pilot dropped down out of the bright Mexican sky in one of the General 's fast fighting planes , zoomed over the Potosi airfield where President Cardenas had established his headquarters at Vista Hermosa , dumped four ineffective 25-lb. bombs and high-tailed it back to his secret air station in the hills . <P> These detonations signaled the attempt last week by President Cardenas to put the final squeeze on his old friend , Saturnine Cedillo . <P> Ox-shouldered , multichinned General Cedillo , onetime Mexican bandit who rode with famed Pancho Villa , has been Strong-man in San Luis Potos for some 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his extensive Potos landholdings , helped boost Seor Crdenas into the Presidency in 1934 and Seor Cedillo became Minister of Agriculture . The General , however , opposed the land expropriation Crdenas program . Nine months ago he resigned in a huff . With cries of " Fascist " from Mexican Laborites and left-wingers ringing in his ears , the old " Bull of Potos " waddled off to his great Las Palomas hacienda . From there he continued to block organization drives of the Leftist CTM labor union in his State , permitted Catholic schools to continue , defiantly hung on to his huge land holdings and held up Government agrarian engineers in their efforts to slice up Potos estates into communal ejidos . <P> Rightists both in Mexico and the U. S. hailed General Cedillo 's defiance as a potential threat to overthrow the Crdenas regime . Mexico 's troubles over the oil expropriations and the resulting business collapse made this threat a likely possibility . So the President two months ago made an attempt to get General Cedillo away from his stronghold . He ordered the General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Crdenas ' home state . General Cedillo , pleading illness , asked for a 45-day respite . Last week , his leave expired , the old General sent in his resignation from the army , announced that he would stay in Potos , " quietly dedicated to agriculture . " <P> At that point President Crdenas increased the number of Federal troops in Potos to 10,000 , sent a squadron of observation planes ahead and himself boarded the million-dollar Presidential special " Olive Train " to investigate matters at first hand in the city of San Luis Potos . There he publicly accused the Bull of Potos of playing ball with the foreign oil companies , and announced the Government was ordering him to disband his private army .
