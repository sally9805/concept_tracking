Last week a few earnest men still had courage enough in their hearts to believe , in the face of cynics ' laughter , that Germans can live on the earth in peace even with Britons and Frenchmen , Japanese with Chinese , and Russians with whoever are their enemies . These men hurried about Europe proposing conferences , asking for moratoriums , begging at least a pause . Their reward was not great . Berlin papers called their pleas the " tubercular coughs of senile sinners , " and their proposals were either damned or neglected by the lieutenants of force . <P> Karl Jacob Burckhardt , League of Nations High Commissioner for Danzig , saw Fhrer Hitler , Herr Ribbentrop , visited Berlin , rushed back to Danzig where he was closeted next day with Polish and Nazi officials . Announced subject of their talk was the Polish-Danzig customs dispute : but within half an hour Polish Cornmissioner General at Danzig Marian Chodacki raced off to Warsaw to see Foreign Minister Josef Beck . Black-haired , patrician , handsome , Swiss-born Dr. Burckhardt , author of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talleyrand , seemed as likely a man as could be found in Europe to act as go-between for Fhrer Hitler and Colonel Beck if direct negotiations at this stage had any chance . He has " been publicly praised for his tact by the Fhrer . He is on excellent terms with top British Cabinet officers . But talk of a settlement quickly fizzled and Dr. Burckhardt stayed put in Danzig . <P> Pope Pius XII received Casimir Papee , Polish Ambassador to the Holy See , heard Poland 's side of the Battle of Danzig on the Vistula . Urging prudence " in this hour of grave decision , " he dispatched an emissary to Warsaw to urge peace . <P> The dread ( and , at week 's end , dead ) subject of Appeasement was revived , both by way of recrimination , and seriously by some who would still rather trust a proven deceiver than shoulder a gun . <P> Like a valiant David twirling his slingshot in the face of a giant adversary , King Leopold III of the Belgians invited six other little fellows-the Foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Finland and Sweden-to join him in Brussels to : 1 ) draft a peace proposal to the powers ; 2 ) pool their raw material resources to insure their neutrality in case the proposal went the way of other peace proposals . <P> Italian Foreign Minister Count Galeazzo Ciano was as elusive as a cake of soap in the bottom of a bath . He had the Ambassadors of France , Great Britain and the U. S. pouncing all over Rome to try to pin him down . Two caught him for a spell-Britain 's Sir Percy Loraine ( but only for a few minutes one evening ) and the U. S. 's William Phillips ( but informally , while basking at Castel Fusano , a fashionable beach outside Rome ; Count Ciano made an appointment for the next morning , which he broke ) . Twice the three Ambassadors almost cornered Count Ciano . The first time , the arrival in Rome of Hungarian Foreign Minister Count Stephan Csaky gave him a chance to refuse to see them . The second time , next morning , he gave them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was reasonably sure they would not follow him .
