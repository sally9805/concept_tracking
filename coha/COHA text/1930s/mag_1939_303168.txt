Like most of his countrymen , Franklin Delano Roosevelt is a stockmarket watcher rather than an economist . To him , as to most of the U. S. , a rising market means that business is all right and a declining market is a sign of woe , fortelling that unemployment will again exceed its " normal " quota of 10,000,000 . When the market is down the New Deal begins to look for new brands of unemployment reducers and market restorers . Last week , it was obviously twirling the dial in search of the right wavelength on which to broadcast a new offensive against renewed depression . <P> The Administration 's main preparations for a drive against Depression were made at hearings of the Temporary National Economic ( monopoly ) Committee . The cue for them was given by Franklin Roosevelt himself . To Wyoming 's Senator Joseph O'Mahoney , the Committee 's chairman , he wrote : <P> " Dear Joe . . . . Idle dollars profit no man . . . . We have mastered the technique of creating necessary credit ; we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full use . . . . " The substance of the letter was : Tell us the answers to depression . <P> For a President who for six years confidently has led the U. S. into one economic program after another , this was on its face an extraordinary admission . In this case , the admission was made to set the stage for another economic program . The monopoly hearing was about to enter a new chapter of its quizzing ; with the aid of SEC it was about to make a diagnosis of depression calling for new remedies . <P> SEC under its new chairman , Jerome Frank ( elected last week by a three-to-two vote of the Commission ) promptly began building up its case : <P> Witness Hansen . Harvard Professor Alvin H. Hansen , fully equipped with charts , tables , a schoolroom pointer and a green eyeshade , delivered the first lecture : From 1923 to 1929 , the average yearly national income was $77 billions , was maintained by the average annual investment of $18.3 billions in new plant and equipment . In 1930-36 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around $65 billions ) and only $8.6 billions were invested in new capital goods . Professor Hansen wasted no time over economists ' chicken &; egg dilemma whether a big national income begets big investments in new capital or vice versa . He blamed the slump in national income squarely on the slump in capital investment . <P> Thus he laid the groundwork for a new recovery program . A year ago , after the stockmarket cracked , the New Deal launched a $4,000,000,000 spending program calculated to raise consumers ' buying power . It did , but a year later recession again rears its ugly head , and this time the Administration , in spite of what the President said May 22 about the milk and the coconut ( see p. 15 ) , is tempted to try something else , is toying with the idea of spending for capital goods . <P> Economist Hansen went on to point out that from 1922 to 1928 the U. S. population increased 9.1% ; from 1930 to 1936 only 4.3% . Contracting with it , all private construction has fallen from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Deal chooses to take Mr. Hansen 's tip , a drive for capital spending may take the form of housing .
