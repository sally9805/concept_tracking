txt Topics c:of The 9Cirrits England is already tuning British up for King GEORGE 'S silver Jubilee jubilee . The exact twentySeason. fifth anniversary comes on May 6 . Thrifty London householders are advertising choice window seats along the route of the royal processions , and one hears complaints of profiteering . Perhaps as a counter move it is announced that there will be many parades through various parts of the city . Dressmakers are busy , as might well be expected . It is obviously hard to see ? how GEORGE V and the British Empire could start out on a second quartercentury of rule without assistance from the milliners in the form of a special Jubilee dress color and special Jubilee designs in hats and shoes . On a higher level it is rumored that the King has set his heart on bringing about a reconciliation with the Irish Free State . Tension between Dublin and London has been growing easier .

One man in England who Poet must be working particularly On the hard for the Jubilee is JOHN Job . MASEFIELD . He is the Poet Laureate and he probably has a few ideas in his head already for the Jubilee ode . We may take it that it will be a very good ode . In the first place , Mr. MASEFIELD is a fine poet . In the second place , there will probably be an unofficial competitor in the field in the person of the unofficial gentleman who in 1897 wrote " Recessional " for Queen VICTOIUA 'S second Jubilee . KIPLING wrote that poem for The London Times , which did not regretfully send it back as an unsolicited manuscript that did not quite fall in with the editorial plans , though not devoid , &c.; Only last November the author of " Recessional " wrote a very good poem for the dedication of the great war mausoleum at Melbourne , Australia .

We are being once more reminded how many things which are wrong in the world are Mother 's fault . Little boys and girls develop a passion for fighting because their mothers kiss them and hug them too much . The tiny tots think it is assault and battery and they go out and do the same to other children . Not much better off are the mothers who do not spoil their children but , on the contrary , make them work hard at their home-work and piano lessons . Such parents are only displaying vicarious ambition . The mothers have the vanity and the young ones do the work . Still other ? discoveries about Mother will readily occur to the reader . They all tend to show that whatever she does she is just out of luck . If she fondles , she develops neuroses . If she disciplines , she produces repressions .

But it does not seem likely to get to that point again . We must remember that in the interval we have discovered the capitalist system to explain most of the things that are wrong with humankind . Social and personal maladjustments for which back in 1928 Mother was responsible we can now easily trace to the Profit ' Motive . There are signs , to be sure , that the popularity of capitalism as a. whippingboy has begun to fade , and this may be why mothers are coming in again .
