Seven years ago when Dr. Robert B. Lawson , physical director of the University of North Carolina , was asked to stir up a little golf interest among his pupils to stave off mortgage foreclosure on a local country club , he admitted frankly that he " did n't know which end of a stymie to take hold of . " His 23-year-old daughter , Estelle ( Phi Beta Kappa ) , knew less . Together they read a book on golf , bought four clubs apiece ( brassie , No. 2 iron , mashie and putter ) as recommended by the main street sporting-goods store . A few months later they not only had all the students golf-conscious but Daughter Lawson-a caddy carrying her four clubs in his hand like sticks of kindling wood- survived two qualifying rounds of the women 's Southern golf championship . <P> That same year , in Minneapolis , a golf-zealous grain broker named Herman Berg forbade his frecklefaced 13-year-old daughter Patty to play any more football ( she was halfback on a boys ' team ) gave her four of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game before she outgrew her middy blouses . <P> Last week Dr. Lawson 's daughter ( now married to an accountant named Julius Page ) and Broker Berg 's daughter ( now freshman at the University of Minnesota ) were co-favorites to win the U. S. women 's golf championship , played at the Westmoreland Country Club , outside Chicago . Each had reached the top of the golf ladder with extraordinary leaps . <P> Estelle Lawson Page , after breaking all the course records in the Carolinas ( she has made five holes-in-one ) and winning most of the major Southern tournaments , made national headlines last year when she won the medal honors in the U. S. women 's championship for the second year in a row , and then went on to upset golf 's famed medal jinx by winning the tournament . Patty Berg made national headlines two years earlier when , as a 17-year-old unknown , she reached the final of the U. S. women 's championship in her first try , and then gave her opponent , famed Glenna Collett Vare , a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last year Patty Berg came through to the U.

S. for the biennial Curtis Cup matches fortnight ago , phlegmatic Estelle Lawson Page and temperamental Patty Berg reached the final for the second year in a row-some-thing that had never happened before in a national golf championship . <P> But this year it was Patty 's day . While Mrs. Page , green-shy after taking three putts on the very first hole , flubbed around the greens , Patty , wearing trousers , played as though she had her ball mesmerized . In the afternoon round , with her mother nervously watching from the fringe of the crowd , she got seven one-putt greens in 13 holes , avenged last year 's defeat on the 31st green , 6 &; 5.         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
