THE story of Father Coughlin is as essentially modern as that of Henry Ford . He is a man who developed something for the first time and is a national personage in consequence . He did not invent the radio ; neither did Ford invent the gasoline engine . He developed the possibilities of the radio as a source of power for himself , or as he would put it , for his ideas . But if not an inventor , he was a discoverer . He discovered himself , a new person shaped and vastly reinforced by the radio . The story , then , is of the development of the radio as an instrument of personal propaganda , and still more of the wonder of Father Coughlin 's self-discovery . He did not dream of it during his humble boyhood . It did not occur to him even when , as an unknown priest , he first persuaded a Detroit radio station to broadcast his Sunday sermons , and later his afternoon addresses for children . It dawned on him with a faint light when , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social aspects of the depression which had just begun , he received his first mailbag of echoing letters . He had been broadcasting long enough to count as a veteran , a pioneer who was building up his parish without looking far beyond its confines . He had a local reputation and had made an enterprising record for a young priest . Then that first rainstorm of letters fell upon his consciousness and woke him up to what he could be . He tested out the miraculous power ; it was real and it was growing . And from then until last summer Father Coughlin was discovering and still discovering his own personality as it was being revealed to him by the radio and by the power it brought him from its vast audience . The story naturally divides into two phases , of which the first , that of self-discovery , ended last summer . By then the new Father Coughlin had been created . And he founded the National League for Social Justice and prepared for the second phase , in which the radio is to be only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of action . This modern story is no less modern for having its origin in the precincts of the oldest Christian church . In 1925 Rome canonized a young French nun who had died in 1897 at the age of twenty-four , and called her St. Theresa of the Little Flower and the Child Jesus . Shortly before her death a change had come over her reticent , shrinking nature . She uttered strange prophecies : God would permit her to remain on earth till the end of time ; she would " let fall from heaven a shower of roses . " Not long after her death evidences poured in of her power . Miraculous cures , conversions , donations were ascribed to her intercession . Her " shower of roses " had begun . She was made a saint , the latest person to be so elevated . Bishop Michael Gallagher of Detroit had been in Rome in 1925 for the canonization , and the year after his return he found his young priest amenable to the proposal that the church he was to build in the almost empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Detroit , should be dedicated to the world 's most modern saint . Father Coughlin ( call it Coglin ) had begun coming to Detroit from Canada in 1921 to preach a weekly sermon in St. Agnes 's Church , and in 1923 was assigned to the diocese . He preached with the full brogue of the educated Irishman , for he was of pure Irish stock . His father , grandfather , and great-grandfather were Irish-American workingmen . His great-grandfather helped dig the Erie Canal . His father , born in Indiana , was stoker on the Great Lakes , drifted to Hamilton , Ontario , became sexton of the cathedral , met a devout seamstress , also of Irish stock , and married her . There in Hamilton Father Coughlin was born forty-three years ago . To pursue the question of nationality for a moment , as a native of Canada he is entitled to British nationality . Whether he ever voted there , I do not know . The son of an American father , he is entitled to American nationality , which he could establish without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registered by his father at an American consulate in Canada . Probably his father never heard of such a precaution at the time . At any rate , as Canadian born he can never aspire to the Presidency unless constitutions to him , as to Hitler , are nothing . He was educated in St. Mary 's parochial school of Hamilton , then in St. Michael 's College ( under the Basilian Fathers ) , and took a doctorate in philosophy at the age of twenty at the University of Toronto . Fie-had made a brilliant start . He was able to go for a three months ' trip to Europe after finishing at Toronto , and came back troubled in mind as to his , career . His inclinations were in three directions  --  the church , politics , and sociology . He had not begun his self-discovery , and did not know that he was to Choose all three in choosing the church . At the dock , on his return from Europe , he met his favorite college teacher , who took him away for a long talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church ; and he plunged into arduous preparatory work under the Basilian order in Toronto . He was ordained four years later and spent his first year as a priest - teaching English in Assumption College , Sandwich , Ontario . Then began the trips to Detroit , and the transfer to that diocese followed . For three years he was in Kalamazoo and for a short period in North Branch before Bishop Gallagher chose him for the trying task of building up the parish of Royal Oak . Then came the day of destiny , when he appeared in the office of the manager of radio station WJR of the Detroit Free Press , asking for a wider audience for his Sunday sermons . His motive was modest . He hoped to build up his parish  --  nothing more . The station manager liked Father Coughlin , and saw that it would be good policy to have a Catholic hour in a city that is 52 per cent Catholic . Little did either of them foresee that not many years later the same priest would be personally attacking E. D. Stair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as chairman of the company which held the stock of the First National Bank , and the Free Press would be lambasting him as " an ecclesiastical Huey Long , " " a religious Walter Winchell , " and a Wall Street speculator . His sermons , and later his afternoon addresses to children , were broadcast for four years without bringing Father Coughlin fame . Gradually he changed the nature of his children 's talks , peppering his religion with a seasoning of politics and economics . It was not until 1930 , when those echoing letters aroused in him the first glimpse of his own potentialities , that he organized the Radio League of the Little Flower and boldly branched out . He engaged time on stations in Chicago and Cincinnati at $1,650 a week . He found the permanent form of his " discourse , " a rhetorical tirade on political , social , and economic themes , knit together by the social philosophy of the liberal encyclicals of Pius XI and Leo XIII . Letters now came in regularly in hundreds and thousands , many with contributions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the way to stimulate replies was to offer to supply a copy of the discourse to anyone who wrote in for it . The tempo of growth speeded up . The response in letters and money justified further expansion , and Father Coughlin rented time on a sixteen-station hook-up of the Columbia system . He became a national figure almost at once . Currency was his most popular theme , and his preaching on the " honest dollar " obviously expressed the masses in the Middle West . He assailed the bankers , he assailed the civilization of mass production . He predicted a new war unless Christianity were introduced into the economic life of the nation . He was dinning his doctrine into a tremendous audience . A discourse on the subject " Hoover Prosperity 1VIeans a New War " brought him his largest single response , 1,200,000 letters . Another , in which he nominated Morgan , Mellon , Mills , and Meyer as the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse , brought 600,000 letters . No priest since time began had regularly addressed an audience of such dimensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitalist greed , he devoted a series to communism ( " Russia and the Red Serpent " ) , in which-he charged that Russia already was fomenting revolution in America . This brought him to Washington , where he was star witness at an investigation by a committee of the House of Representatives . A succeeding series attacked prohibition . It was still more popular . And his mounting mail became now a steady flood , averaging for a long period about 80,000 letters a week . He received more than any other man in America . The radio was a miraculous source of revenue . If the money did not flow with large enough volume , Father Cough-lb had only to suggest that he might have to discontinue his " work " for want of funds . The next mails brought again the donations , big and little . To Father Coughlin these gifts must have seemed indeed like roses showered from heaven . And since much of the money went to build the first church to the modern Saint of the Little Flower , it all must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built , a fine edifice , with a magnificent Crucifixion Tower at some distance from it . The design was modern and in good taste . In the tower was Father Coughlin 's workshop , with a study on the top floor where he could prepare his discourses and work out the final stages of self-discovery . Beneath him were more than a hundred clerks and stenographers , handling his enormous mail . The attacks on the bankers grew more violent , and the Columbia Broadcasting System began hearing complaints that a priest with so provocative a message should be given access to the air . Columbia thought it had its finger on the public pulse , and threatened to shut down on Father Coughlin unless he submitted to censorship for the remainder of his contract . The next Sunday Father Coughlin raised the issue of free speech over the radio . He asked his listeners to say whether he should be allowed to continue uncensored . They overwhelmed Columbia with their protests ; it was a-lesson on the ease of making mistakes in reading the public pulse . Father Coughlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbia rid itself of embarrassment by inventing its own Church of the Air , and easing out the priest of Detroit , as though it was not in fact suppressing him . Without Columbia , Father Coughlin could turn to NBC , but here he was met with a refusal . It looked as though the end of the miracle days had come . But once more the manager of the Free Press station came to his help . - He worked out the details by which Father Coughlin could hire his own stations and pay for the connecting telephone lines himself . Thus he created his own network . It It was an incredible sum for the once humble priest . It was all the greater since he must also raise the funds for the $750,000 church to the donor of heavenly roses . But he was not afraid , and his faith was justified . The church was built ; the radio bills , hundreds of thousands of dollars a year , could be paid . The storm over Father Coughlin reached its climax when the banks closed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of over half a billion , was the largest institution closed in America . Here was banking " iniquity " on Father Coughlin 's own doorstep , and he led the attack with new virulence . Moreover , he was in close connection with the powers at Washington . He knew the bank was to close days before anyone else in Detroit knew it . Detroit business interests were bitter and ascribed vindictive motives to Washington . Father Coughlin for the first time became spokesman for the New Deal , defended its actions , and pre-dicted the prosecution and conviction of the bankers involved . The role of the priest as a " force in Washington " con-tinued until last summer . He came to the White House . He conferred with Raymond Moley and other key men . He was sought after as an oracle of public opinion . He de-fended the New Deal , supported the President . Not only were his discourses heard by a vast audience ; they were widely reported in the press . His following probably included Catholics and Protestants in equal numbers . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own brain trust , a staff of experts to comb the world for material for the discourses , as well as a clerical staff that dealt with the mail . Two or three young priests could be employed to take care of his parish work and preach the Sunday sermons . His parishioners saw little of him . He was confined to the top room of Crucifixion Tower and was heard by his flock only through loud speakers . He did not even deliver his discourses from his pulpit , but spoke only from the tower . If Father Coughlin had gone no farther , had been con-tent to remain the sociological orator  --  vocal passion brought into millions of homes  --  he would have revealed a singularly balanced spirit . But he could not stop . He would form a national lobby  --  that is what it was at first called . He would bring a pressure on Washington that the capital had never before felt , his pressure , Father Coughlin 's pressure . So he at last stepped out of his almost mythical impersonality of being only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization . After the election he announced his National League for Social Justice , and with it a platform of sixteen planks . Twelve of these , say his detractors , are " lifted " from the Farmer-Labor platform . Stemming from Father Coughlin 's contact with his own national parish , they are a revealing picture of what his public wants  --  that is , as far as they go , and if taken on their face value . As they will have sounded to his listeners they proclaim the following principles : Liberty of conscience and of education . A living annual wage . Nationalization of banking and currency and of natural resources . Private ownership of all other property . Control of private property for the public good . Government banking . Congressional control of coinage . Steady currency value . Cost of production plus a fair value for agriculture . Labor unions under government protection . Recall of non-productive bonds . Abolition- of tax-free bonds . Social taxation.Simplification of government . In war the conscription of wealth . Human rights to be preferred to property rights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange transfusion of passions , Father Coughlin 's and those of his responding radio audience . In them , and in the new organization , he has now discovered himself fully . Behind the program is a strong force of rhetoric , with a mass appeal not used or even understood by any other out sider in American politics striving for a leading part in affairs . The priest knows how to combine religion with resentment in a strange but potent broth . " In politics , " he says , " I am neither Republican , Democrat , nor Socialist . I glory in the fact that -I am a simple Catholic priest endeavoring to inject Christianity into the fabric of an economic system woven upon the loom of greed by the cunning fingers of those who manipulate the shuttles of human lives for their own selfish purposes . " This is the crudely poetic language which has come through the millions of loud speakers and brought millions of responses . But in the sixteen planks there is no word of democratic government , and the right of free speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listeners asked , and they probably did not notice it . But it is a significant feature in the Coughlin program . Mr. Swing 's second article on Father Coughlin will appear next week . His regular Washington letter will be resumed wizen Congress convenes in January.
