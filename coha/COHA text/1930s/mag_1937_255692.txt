With a satisfied glint behind his thick- lensed spectacles , stoop-shouldered Turkish Foreign Minister Dr. Tewfik Rushtu Aras left Geneva last week where he had been representing his country at the League Council 's 96th session ( TIME , Feb. 1 ) . That suave diplomat , onetime obstetrician , had now delivered for Turkey a League settlement of the Turkish-French dispute over the sanjak ( district ) of Alexandretta which Dictator Mustafa Kamal Ataturk had demanded that France hand to him from her Syrian mandate ( TIME , Jan. 18 et seq . ) . <P> The League Council had agreed that : 1 ) , the Alexandretta district shall have its own administration under supervision of a League High Commissioner of French nationality , 2 ) it shall owe allegiance to Syria three years hence when France gives up her Syrian mandate , 3 ) Turkey and France shall " guarantee its international integrity . " Foreign Minister Dr. Aras knew that this " strictly legal and just settlement " would give Dictator Kamal Atatrk virtual dominion of Alexandretta , that Turks would have free access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> By no means satisfied with this single feather in his cap , Dr. Aras did not go straight home but blinked his way across Europe , stopped off at Milan for a head-to-head with Mussolini 's son-in-law , Count Galeazzo Ciano , Europe 's youngest foreign minister . These two reached an accord ending much of the Italo-Turkish tension which has sprung from Kamal Atatrk 's closeness to Stalin . Turkish fears that operations against her might take off from Italy 's Dodecanese Islands , and Italian nervousness about Turkey 's refortification of the Dardanelles . In substance the Ciano-Aras accord is a pact of mutual good intentions . <P> Seeing Turkey move away from Russia , Dictators Mussolini &; Hitler were overjoyed last week , but the real triumph was Dr. Aras ' . He had converted a bad-blooded neighbor into an avowed friend . But even now he was not ready to go , home . Instead , he entrained for Belgrade to hatch plans with Yugoslavia 's Premier Dr. Milan Stoyadinovich for the coming conference at Athens of the Balkan Entente ( Turkey , Greece , Yugoslavia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
