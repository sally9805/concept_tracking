With the fattest melon to cut in many a year , the National Academy of Design opened its 111th exhibition in Manhattan last week , showed 530 paintings , prints and pieces of sculpture , awarded $4,250 in prizes to 15 different artists . <P> President Jonas Lie won a gold medal for himself with a picture of Maine fishing boats in a rising mist entitled The Curtain Rises . <P> The Ellin P. Speyer Prize ( $300 ) for " a portrayal of humaneness toward animals , " was given , after due thought , to Sculptor Gertrude K. Lathrop for a statue of a woolly lamb . <P> Critics were thunderstruck to learn that the $500 Palmer Prize for marine painting went to one Hayley Lever of Caldwell , N.J. and not to that persistent and popular sea painter , Frederick Waugh ( TIME , Dec. 17 , 1934 et seq . ) .

Citizen Blumenfeld turned out to be a 17-year-old Brooklyn high-school graduate . Though born in France of Russian parents , he was technically eligible to receive the prize since his father has become a naturalized U. S. citizen . <P> The judges awarded four instead of the usual two Altman prizes to U. S.-born citizens . Most important of the Altman prizes ( $700 ) went to Sidney E. Dickinson , conservative portraitist and onetime art instructor , for a curious canvas entitled The Pale Rider . Apparently having listened to much talk about surrealism , Artist Dickinson did a picture of a morose young woman in a red dress seated on a falling , pedestal by a table loaded with books . A Negro in a grey flannel shirt is pulling a heavy tarpaulin over the whole composition while three white roses fall from the sky . The Pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is painted with the stodgy technique of a bank president 's portrait , the effect is as surprising as would be the sight of Herbert Hoover blowing a tenor saxophone . <P> " I have n't the slightest idea what it is about , " admitted President Lie , " but we liked the way it was painted .
