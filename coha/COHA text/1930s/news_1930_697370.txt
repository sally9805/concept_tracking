txt Making civil aviation pay is a problem that perplexes the nations engaged In it . In Europe the transport companies could not operate without government subsidies . In the United States aid in the form of mail contracts is essential . The English shy at the word subsidy . Mr. G. E. Woons HUMPHERY , managing director of Imperial Airways , holds that " it would be more descriptive " to speak of the assistance it receives from the Government as " national payment for national services rendered . " He has made a comparison of what is being done in the principal countries to promote civil aviation in aircraft used , miles flown , passengers , mails and freight carried , cost , and , in the case of Great Britain , returns on the investment . Mr. HUAIPIIERY takes statistics published by the American publication Aviation as the basis of most of his calculations , with the comment , however , that the figures give the United States the advantage of one year , 1929 being compared with 1928 for Europe . But he frankly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handicap of two years in the beginning . A table which shows the United States far in the lead in miles flown and airplanes employed in regular transport service must be read with the understanding that the figures for Germany , France and Great Britain are those of 1928 . In 1929 the number of planes used in the United States was 619 and miles flown were 36,982 . The figures for Germany were 200 planes and 18,540 miles , for France 241 and 11,542 , and for Great Britain 15 and 2,322 . While Mr. IR:maul-11w thinks that flying in the whole British Empire would make a better showing , he is content to deal with the home statistics as given , for he wants to make out a case of superior methods of operation for Great Britain , which in the end should make its civil aviation self-supporting . He claims more durable planes , better engines and superior economical management . " The fact is , " he writes , " that because British air " craft and engines are the most reliable " of all , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Great Britain is small in area and near the Continent . It will therefore never make a display of aircraft activity compared with that of the United States , extensive in territory and with many large cities and States to serve . Add the British colonies , and the United States would still be far in the lead in development . Great Britain finds satisfaction in the following totals of average miles a year flown by " each aircraft in regular transport service " United States 32,700 , Germany 31,700 , France 18,000 , Great Britain 68,200 . Statistics of subsidies and " compensation " show : The United States ( 1929 ) ? 9,770,000 , and Germany , France and Great Britain ( all 1928 ) ? 960,000 , ? 940 , - 000 and ? 230,000 . Imperial Airways , Mr. HUMPIIERI 'S company , lost money in the first two years of operation , but made profits in the next three years ? ? 78,861 in the fifth . He contends that Great Britain " gets better value for " money expended on aviation subsidies " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intends this statement as a hint to American companies to publish their balance sheets . At the rate at which their business is growing they may soon be able to oblige him .
