As he released his long-awaited report on the U. S. merchant marine in Washington last week , Joseph Patrick Kennedy declared " This is the toughest job I ever handled in my life , without any reservations whatever . " Mr. Kennedy has had tough jobs before , including organization of the Securities Exchange Commission , but even a quick glance at the official summary , briefed down to 17 pages , was enough to convince reporters that Mr. Kennedy spoke with feeling and sincerity . The report itself was a monumental document of 40,000 words . No desiccated aggregation of charts and tabulation , it was a bluntly dispassionate analysis of a national problem that has been obscured for a generation in a curious combination of nostalgic sentiments and cunning self-interest . A more hard-boiled document has never come out of official Washington than the Maritime Commission 's Economic Survey of the American Merchant Marine . <P> Under the Maritime Act of 1936 Mr. Kennedy 's Commission was ordered to make not one but several studies of U. S. shipping . That seemed to beg the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study which would serve as a foundation for future shipping policy . Experts in every phase of the shipping industry were drafted to aid in the work . And the upshot was to propound and answer five major questions : <P> Does the U. S. really need a merchant marine ? Of all the arguments ever advanced for a subsidized fleet , the Commission found only two that were sound-the importance of shipping to foreign trade and to National defense . Today the U. S. is the world 's greatest exporting nation , about 10% of the country 's movable production going overseas . In imports it ranks second only to the United Kingdom . Without its own ships the U. S. might be left stranded , as it was during the War , when foreign bottoms virtually disappeared from trade routes outside the War Zone . <P> A merchant marine is a definite branch of the National defense . It was a U. S. admiral , the late Alfred T. Mahan , who devised the standard war college formula : Sea power equals naval vessels plus merchant vessels . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major foreign power , the U. S. would need a minimum of 1,000 merchant ships of all types . These are now available but they are old , and in certain categories there is serious shortage . There are only ten combination freight &; passenger vessels which could be converted into aircraft carriers . The Navy thinks there should be at least 20 . The 300 tankers needed to service the battle fleets are available but there is a deficiency of high-speed tankers ( 16 knots or better ) . When Roosevelt I sent the U. S. Navy around the world in 1908 the fighting ships were followed everywhere by a raffish stream of foreign-flag tenders , a ludicrous exhibition which the Navy Department never forgot .
