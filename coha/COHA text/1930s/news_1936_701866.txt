txt Panacea Again with his usual nonchalant wave of the hand , Mr. Roosevelt reiterates his panacea for the nation 's ills  --  higher wages and shorter hours . Millions of employes of small business have to buy goods and should the short-hour , highwage program go over it would affect the producers of things these longhour , shorter-paid people have to buy . The price of things would go up , and how could these millions of people possibly buy at increased prices ? Incidentally , what are the people now on relief rolls and relief work going to use for money to pay these higher prices ? Or are the real workers and producers of the nation again going to be overtaxed to pay higher wages to them ? The idea sounds well in print , like the Townsend plan , but it is unworkable , and any one who subscribes to it belongs in Utopia or Matteawan. ? MABEI , EMPIE , New York .
