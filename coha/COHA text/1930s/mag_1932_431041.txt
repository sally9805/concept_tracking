AN EARNEST Critic of life and the arts is apt to find no aspect of contemporary America more distressing than her architecture . From an Olympian height he views it , North , South , East , West ; unimpressed by shout and boasting , by the effulgence of endless marble and bronze and gold , he passes stern judgment . It is almost all bad , inexcusably bad . Too vacuous to create a style appropriate to modern conditions , it spends all its energies in a servile borrowing from the past . It prefers any stolen garment , no matter how incongruous or outmoded , to what should be its own . Behind the costly pretense there is only emptiness and a colossal Lie . Puerile , shallow , insincere ( the critical adjectives will mount passionately ) , its best is merely the negation of " good taste , " its worst unspeakably vicious . Its limitless resources , the opportunities ? hitherto scarcely dreamed of ? that confront it , make the trivial vulgarity of its accomplishment all the more tragic . The heavens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too absorbed in sewing ruffles on its Louis XVI costume to look up . Your true idealist in architecture is not given to gentle words and kindly compromises . Things which the ordinary man might accept without an instant 's doubt move him to an eloquence worthy of Savonarola denouncing the sins of Florence . He takes no joy , for example , in the expensive attempts of our universities to fit , over their corpulence , the monastic habit of Oxford . A Corinthian column from antique Rome , reborn to grace the new Trust and Savings Bank , will awake in him only nausea . Alike accursed in his eyes are the World 's Largest Hotel and the Million-dollar Movie Theater , country club and high school , palace and hovel . Here is no architecture born in passionate travail of the soul , shining with the beauty of simplicity and logic and fitness to use ; these had their shameful spawning in photographs from the office library , in picture post cards , in sentimental memories of a trip to Italy . Spawned , and died stillborn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say ) there is no life in American architecture . One sees a great deal of agitation ; buildings are torn down and others take their places overnight , cities become scarcely recognizable in a year . But so far as one is concerned with architectural significance , all this frenzy of movement is only the twitching of a galvanized corpse , the whirl of fallen leaves in a November wind . Wasted the mountains of brick and stone , the rivers of molten metal , the endless forests , the billions of dollars ? wasted and lost forever . Well in the front rank of this dance of death is the American home ; your home , reader , and mine . You may have thought it on the whole a nice enough place to live in . You may even have been rather proud of it at times ? when the tulips were in bloom , or when drawn shades and a crackling fire made the living room seem very snug and secret . Perhaps you have compared it with that Victorian relic in the next block , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanked God that you were living in the twentieth century instead of the nineteenth . Pharisee ! Your own house , to one who has eyes , is quite as shameful . It is more dangerous , indeed , to the cause of true architecture than the worst Victorian atrocity . That was an open attack with a club , brutally honest ; this is the subtlest of poisons , honeyed over with a surface prettiness and the plausibility of " good taste . " There is no escape in pleading that because your house is adapted from the best Colonial models , it has a fitness to American soil that the obvious importations from Europe lack . The tremendous acceleration in life since the Industrial Revolution has swept your Colonial ancestors off to a very dim past . He is closer to Geoffrey of Monmouth than to you , far closer to Julius Caesar . The mode of life his dwelling represents is as dead as Imperial Rome ; the degree of science in its construction , as compared with achievements to-day in steel and reenforced concrete , seems almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the historical styles , paired with your motor , your radio , your electric light and telephone , are equally incongruous , all Periods alike in their absurdity . There is no escape ; your house goes to the block with the rest . It is dishonest , because it pretends to be what it is not . It is cowardly , because it is afraid to show itself undisguised . It has no more reality than a stage set . Apollyon lurks beneath that roof with its cunningly aged shingles , around the slender Doric pillars of your porch , behind those many-paned windows that so successfully reproduce the old Colonial bottle glass . His breath is on your Adam mantle , your old pine paneling , your authentic wall paper . Your house cost far too much to build , took far too long ; wasteful and inefficient , it costs far too much to maintain . It is too dark ; Georgian windows let in barely half enough sunlight . It is shockingly overcrowded with furniture , pictures , lamps , bric-a-brac ? with every sort of useless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creditable thing about it is the bathroom . And if you allow yourself to be seduced by advertising campaigns , you may well have spoiled even that with Directoire fittings . Poor dweller in a whited sepulcher ! One agrees with you , it is pretty , it has charm . But does the stench of its inner corruption never reach your nostrils ? Criticism 's favorite weapon against the American home is the American automobile . And with reason ; it is hard to imagine more effective parallels than can be drawn between the two . The ceaseless race toward perfection which makes cars every year more swift and silent and powerful at a reduced expense is in sharp contrast to the snail 's progress of ideas in domestic architecture . The beauty of the automobile ? product of calculated simplicity , of clean lines and bare polished planes , of a machine 's perfect fitness to its use ? is a thing integral with the car itself , utterly modern , without a trace of debt to the past . It is a challenge to the architect who thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dress , and can be safely found only in the past . The speed and economy and efficiency that characterize the production of motors to-day are a grave rebuke to contemporary methods of house building , still so primitive and costly . Modern resources should and can make a home as immediately available to every American family as a Ford , and at a like minimum of cost . There is no simpler means of appreciating the needless absurdity of contemporary building methods than by imagining the same methods applied to the production of the automobile . ( The device is that of Mr. Buckminster Fuller , one of the most provocative of architectural critics . ) Suppose it the result not of factory standardization , but of human individualism ; born of the highly uncoordinated efforts of client , architect , draftsmen , specification writer , contractor , subcontractors , automobile accessory houses , building inspectors , insurance company inspectors , and workmen in a dozen mutually jealous unions . Supplant the Machine 's speed and efficiency by human slowness and waste ; by endless arguments , endless delays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be done over , parts that arrive the wrong size and have to be sent back , troubles with the unions , troubles with the subcontractors , troubles with the building inspector , bad weather holding up the work , demands for more time and more money . And imagine what the car would look like in the end to its owner , after nine months or so of waiting and a probable expenditure of fifty thousand dollars . One can almost see photographs of it in the exclusive magazines ; beautiful photographs on crisp , glossy paper : " This charming six-cylinder sedan reproduces faithfully the old-world elegance of the stately baronial coaches of Normandy , which carried their owners to the court of the Fifteenth Louis . However , one of the happiest things about American automobile design is that it need not adhere pedantically to any one manner ; and so you will find that the exuberant bronze lanterns which the architect has so delightfully adapted to modern use as headlights came from a Venetian gondola of the Seicento , while the exquisitely carved wheels ( no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originals in the collection of the Princesse de Broglie. . . . " @# THERE IS SOUND criticism here , not lightly to be dismissed as futuristic nonsense . These men who try and condemn American architecture are not " cranks " ( unless you wish to consider their intensity of purpose a sign of mental instability ) . Most of them are above the average in intelligence ; far above it in sincerity and seriousness . Architecture is to them a religion , not merely a pleasant profession for gentlemen . They are its Protestants , as passionately intolerant of what they conceive to be decadence as any Luther or Calvin . They fight unsparingly , and with arguments not easy to parry . They will say , for example , that the scientific discoveries of the nineteenth century made a complete break in the continuity of architecture , marked as decisive a step forward as the discovery , unknown millenniums ago , of the arch . On one side of this break is your brick Georgian house , which would not have seemed unfamiliar to the first kings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is cousin to the prehistoric wooden ancestor of the Parthenon . On the other side of the break are processes and possibilities undreamed of before , the miracles of steel , the endless resources of the Machine . Inexorable progress has gone so far , so suddenly , in this one stride that the chain of tradition has snapped for the first time in history . To-day architecture is free , stands alone . What if this too abrupt freedom has brought confusion and fear ; if the architect looks back longingly at his chain , his dear , familiar chain , that held together such a pleasant company ; if he pretends pathetically that there has been no break , and displays to the world a chain he has made himself out of bits of tinsel and string ? Fear and confusion will pass . Freedom remains , and in time will be recognized as a help , not a hindrance in building the great work of the future . Why sigh ( they will say ) for the Greek ? He had no secret of perfection . His magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems peculiar to his age by using the best means he had at hand . The Modern can rival the Greek by doing the very same thing : by solving the problems peculiar to his age with the best means he has at hand . The Modern can achieve greatness with reenforced concrete , glass , and machines just as surely as the Monk achieved it with stone , glass , and men . He will rival no one and achieve nothing by erecting imitations of the Parthenon or of Chartres . So one finds an architect and theorist like Le Corbusier in France approaching the problem of the modern house with a mind studiously stripped of traditions and inherited prejudices ; seeking its solution in terms wholly of the twentieth century . To him the house of to-day , in the scale of evolution , is almost as far beyond Mount Vernon as the latter is beyond a cave . Twentieth-century machines give it light , keep it warm or cold , clean it , feed and amuse its owners and keep them in communication with the world ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then can not we respect it as we do our other machines , the automobile , the steamship , the A machine , finally , is beautiful , because it is perfectly adapted to its use ; because , no matter how complicated it may seem , it has the essential simplicity of logic . Forget your superstitions . Beauty in architecture is no monopoly of pilasters and wrought-iron balconies . It is far more fundamental than any such tricks of surface decoration . Beauty comes from honest structure and lucid proportions , from simplicity and perfect functioning . If your house has these it will be beautiful and inspiring , even though it bears not the slightest resemblance to Haddon Hall or the Petit Trianon . There is to some a heady wine in words like these . One begins to feel young , very daring , full of ideals . One remembers the first time he was told that the Greatest Adventure of All is the Christian Life , and resolved forthwith to cut out smoking and go to help Dr. Grenfell in Labrador . So when one comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his " school , " the visible tokens of the new era , it is with a mind almost anxious to see in them something as stirring as the theories they embody . There are a number of these houses in Holland and Germany , some in France and England , a few in the United States . They look , as one would expect , a good deal alike . The new architecture cares nothing for " local flavor " or national character ; like the Machine it exalts , it is heedless of political boundaries . So one sees modernist houses in Los Angeles very much as they are in Berlin : boldly geometrical in their masses , aggressively simple in elements and composition . White walls ; flat roofs ; windows in concentrated areas of glass . Terraces everywhere to invite the sun , porches ? half indoors , half out ? that seem both living room and garden . Broad , untroubled planes , lines crisply precise . Decoration cut to an unobtrusive minimum of metal railings and awning supports . These houses have been scraped clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the Home reduced to its barest essentials of efficient and comfortable shelter . airplane ? Admit its nature and make the most of it ? No one tries to disguise his yacht as Columbus 's Santa Maria . No one embellishes the turbine with egg-and-dart moldings . It is as silly to try to hide the mechanical essence of your house under a Period exterior as to secrete your telephone under the ruffled skirts of a doll . The house is a machine . Begin with that fact . Make the most of it . A machine , in the first place , is fabricated by other machines . Who to-day would make an engine by hand ? Yet there is an equal absurdity in piling brick on brick as laboriously as the architects of Babylon , when a concrete wall can be made almost as readily as water is poured into a bottle . Why de end on wood p and a carpenter when machined metal is fireproof , rotproof , and infinitely more elastic in its possible uses ? Why not , then , adopt mass production of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimensions ? and effect as great an economy of time and money as we have in the manufacture of the automobile ? A machine justifies itself only when it is as efficient as men can make it . A house , therefore , should be as practical , as economical , as unsentimental as a tractor . Why continue , for example , the romantic pretense that it must have a hip or gable roof ? The flat roof wastes no attic space ; it can be readily converted into a terrace for sun bathing ; modern methods of insulation and rain proofing have removed the last traditional objections to its use . Again , an important duty of the house , as an efficient mechanical servant of man , is to promote to the best of its ability the health of its inhabitants . We know now something of the great therapeutic value of direct sunlight . It is possible to-day , as never before , to let that sunlight into our houses in a healing flood ; to make the entire side of a room one great window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the old picturesque halfgloom , who still thinks of windows as decorative spots , three feet by five , neatly arranged , is potentially as maleficent as a well-poisoner . The interiors show an equal austerity . White walls ; sunlight ; a few articles of furniture , preferably built in . There are no projections , no undercut moldings , no dark corners to hold dirt ; no busts of Dante , no models of galleons , no art lamps , no microbe-treasuring rugs . The rooms might almost be cleaned with a fire hose . One can imagine these houses functioning as smoothly and perfectly as the operating theater of a hospital . Indeed it is a hospital they suggest , or the deck of an ocean liner , light , airy , aseptic . Here is honest modern construction and lucid proportioning ; here is simplicity and order , and a machine 's perfect fitness for use . Here ? if you will ? is Beauty . And it is not enough . One 's enthusiasm slowly fades . Something is wrong here after all , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , and all the gallant phrases , there is a flaw in them somewhere . III THE DIFFICULTY iS to say where and why . One has at first only a feeling , a creeping vague dissatisfaction with these shells of concrete and glass . The physical facts of the case , of course , are unassailable . To-day 's house probably deserves everything ( with an allowance for picturesque exaggeration ) that the Modernists say of it . To-morrow 's house is everything that To-day 's is not . It is dangerous trying to combat logic and unassailable facts with nothing more than a feeling of disappointment . And yet one becomes more and more sure . Something has been left out here , forgotten from the start ; some intangible factor that clouds all these clear certainties . This is not the way to build a brighter Hellas . A first objection might be this : that in their zeal for the perfection of architecture , these Modernists have lost sight of the basic imperfections of man . They exalt above all else logic , frankness , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are conspicuously absent in man , and for which he has seldom shown any great appreciation . Here is a fundamental disparity , and perhaps the source of the whole trouble . It is one of the burdens of the architect that his dreams can be realized only by the help of other men . A poet can attain the Oxford Book of English Verse in lonely obscurity , without a thought of his fellows ; an architect must accept the world and make his compromise with it , or fail utterly . He may be a great genius , but unless his ideas are persuasive enough to lesser men to seem worth the trouble of execution , they will never be anything more than drawings ; pathetic embryos in the museum of architectural curiosities . One begins to appreciate , now , the magnitude of what these Modernists are undertaking , what they must accomplish if their ideas are to be accepted by anything more than a small group of extremists and sensation-hunters . It is difficult enough to persuade one client , or a half dozen , or fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prejudices of a whole civilization ! For that , there must be an Idea as stirring as the enthusiasm for Greece and Rome that swept over Europe in the Renaissance . They plan a revolution as truly as do the Communists ; to achieve it , they must deal in elementals that hold good in every class and every country . It is not for them to rest satisfied with the approval of a critical minority ; they must be as universally appealing as Charlie Chaplin or the desire for a comfortable old age . Logic and efficiency and order are universal qualities , certainly . But are they the right ones to place so much trust in ? Man , in the fundamentals of his life ( and choosing a home is one of them ) , is notoriously illogical , inefficient , disordered . His feeling for these virtues with which he is so scantily endowed is seldom warmer than an uneasy tolerance . They seem to him always a trifle inhuman ; emphasis can make them actively irritating . It is never well to forget Aristides. that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his age , who was banished from Athens because people were tired of hearing him called " The Just . " There is no surer sign of man 's divergence from the Modernist ideal than this : that he can not , as yet , religiously think of his house as being merely a machine to give him efficient and comfortable shelter . It is that , of course , but how much more ; how inextricably tangled with memories and hopes and sentimental dreaming , caught in a confused twilight world of emotion where logic never appears . For good or ill , man has made his house a duality like himself . Part of it is a tangible body which can be measured and photographed , which follows definite physical laws ; part is a wholly intangible spirit which is not to be measured or predicted in any way , which follows no laws at all . When a man 's automobile consistently breaks down , he usually gets rid of it as quickly as possible . Yet his house may behave equally ill ? its roof leak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning ? he will excuse it as charitably , sometimes , as he would the failings of a friend , and still think it on the whole the best place in the world to live . And this by no reasoned weighing of merits against faults ; the thing will be instinctive , a matter of obscure , wholly unreasonable emotions . A home , after all , stands in the relation of friend to most people . One very seldom chooses a friend because he is logical and efficient and animated by the highest ideals . An employee yes , and so one 's office or factory . Butfriendships spring up ( and houses are chosen ) by capricious trifles : a mutual fondness for tennis or discussing literature at tea-time ; the size of a fireplace or the sweep of a roof line . One rather shudders at the thought of intimacy with someone who could never be anything but logical and efficient ; whose fierce honesty would impel him to say exactly what he was thinking , always ; who would test every action by the uncompromising light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do anything impulsive or hasty or sentimental . There are virtues and virtues . One wonders why the Modernists should have chosen to perpetuate in their house the least companionable of all . And yet there is really nothing to wonder at . For Le Corbusier and those who think with him have forgotten , or elected to ignore , all the elements in man which refuse to dovetail into their theories ; the imponderables that can not be measured by even the most delicate machines , the inconsistencies that mock at logic . Their house , too , has no imponderables . It is no more troubled and complicated by human emotion than a Diesel engine . There is nothing about it that has not been made in a factory . One suspects that their delight in a mechanized age has led them to the subconscious belief that man himself is little more than a machine , easily understood , easily disposed of ; that shelter and comfort will make hm contented , plenty of light and air and green vegetables will keep him healthy , and the four-hour day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ah , happy man ? his mind like an exhibition motor in an automobile show . Everything polished and gleaming , all the parts neatly located and explained on a chart ; no barnacles on the flywheel , no waste clogging the feed-pipe , no mice nesting in the differential . He is a little difficult to identify among one 's acquaintances , this Modern Man . But he must exist somewhere , to live in the Modern , No-nonsense House . It is curious that the critics should be so well aware of human frailty and its debauching effect on architecture in the past ? and should seem so unaware that human frailty continues unabated , and must affect their own work . To-day 's house , which they attack so bitterly , gives after all a fairly accurate picture of its owner . If it is sentimental and inconsistent and cluttered with useless survivals , that is because he too is sentimental and inconsistent , and goes always under a heavy burden of inherited prejudices and superstitions . It is difficult to imagine his carrying all these unhappy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; all his silly feelings about pine paneling and flagstone walks and Charm . Perhaps the critics , piling up vitriolic adjectives as they write , like to fancy their words an acid bath from which this owner ? now so imperfect ? will emerge purified , scoured clean of all his follies , and aching to live in a massproduction house . One can grant the necessity , at least , of some such miracle . For as things now stand , the Modernist house seems designed not for man at all ? not for you or me or anyone we know ? but for the inhabitants of some Wellsian Utopia who have long since grown beyond human weaknesses . And this is why one finds it unreal , and disappointing in spite of its virtues , its beauty , the stirring words that champion it . This is its gravest fault , that it recognizes only a part of man , is related to only a fraction of life . The surest source of complication and failure in domestic architecture is precisely the factor which this house refuses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human emotion . Can any problem be solved when one of its chief elements is disregarded ? THERE IS a psychology of escape in architecture as well as in literature or painting . Nothing offers a better illustration of this than the amazing popularity enjoyed in our greatest cities by the type of restaurant that pretends to be A Bit of Old Florence , or A Quaint Corner in Seville . One can not feel proud of these architectural pustules , but they are not to be dismissed as simple manifestations of bad taste . They are more complex than that , and their reason for existence lies deep in the nature of the city itself . They signalize a protest ? crude and obvious , of course ? against a manner of living which every year grows more complicated and harassed . To a city dweller the Machine Age is most noticeable in it most offensive aspects , as an incessant , brutal attack on human nerves . The roar of the elevated , the head-splitting clatter of riveters , the shameful indignity of a subway rush , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from these that a city 's population goes to Florida if it can , and if it ca n't , takes refuge in imitations of the Alcazar and the Bargello . Their pretense may be little more than childish , the stone arches obviously plaster , the massive oak timbers painted concrete ; but they serve their purpose . They satisfy some obscure corner of a man 's mind that desires illusion , even cheap illusion ; that hates the pandemonium outside , and wants to pretend , if only for an hour , that the world is quiet again , and leisurely . Most people are not wholly at ease in the modern world , and they are willing to pay well for the illusions that momentarily soften and disguise it . They find , perhaps , that they can bear it more contentedly ? noise and confusion , hurry , everlasting tension ? by virtue of the hours in which , consciously or not , they pretend that it does not exist . For its steely common sense they substitute the fairy-book life of the movies ; from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medievalism . And at the end of a day 's work they go home thankfully to houses that look as little like an office building as possible ; that deny office buildings , deny the twentieth century , deny that machines were ever invented . The corners of their spirit , rubbed raw by machinery , are soothed by hooked rugs and pewter and prints ; by old things ( even by poor copies of old things ) that breathe the serenity of a simpler age . It is significant for more reasons than one that enthusiasm for the Machine House has been largely confined to Europe . The critic can explain this easily enough ; Americans are notoriously slaves to a corrupt academic tradition . But one may perceive , also , that so far Europe has been merely toying with the Machine Age , while America is living with it and has found it a not completely comfortable bedfellow . Consider a Frenchman , working in a city still dominated by the eighteenth century . Perhaps it was only last year that his home knew the excitement of steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five flights of stairs to his office because the ascenseur is in temporary difficulties . One can excuse his idealizing a perfectly mechanized life , and dreaming of a modern house full of marvels of comfort and efficiency . But the American has been brought up on mechanical marvels . The elevator that may carry him fifty stories to his office is efficient beyond all dreaming . The only thing that stands between it and absolute perfection is the fact that its passengers , being weakly human , can not be forced to get on and off much faster , in spite of every sort of ingenious mental prodding . This American obscurely resents being bullied by high-speed elevators , being chained to telephones , being hustled by some machines and deafened by others all day long , and with the years he piles up a subconscious rebellion . When the chance comes for him to express his resentment , he buys a house that he and his wife have found in the country ; an old , rundown farmhouse in the hills , with big stone chimneys and a beamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their surroundings . The European escape is into the future ; a future which in most respects is merely an intensification of the American 's present . The American knows that sort of thing too well already , and ? rightly or wrongly , as you prefer ? chooses his solace from the past . There is small profit to the critics in reviling imitative architecture while the conditions that encourage it are unabated . As long as the realities of a machine-made world are so uncomfortable to man that he can not accept them without at least a partial disguise , he will continue to use his home as an escape from Fact ; and domestic architecture will continue to be just as illogical , imitative , and falsely picturesque as it is to-day . Modernism has had its well-deserved victories . Skyscraper , factory , airport ; the past has no claim on these or their like , and the present knows how to treat them superlatively well . But its fiercest struggle and most important ? over the body of the American home ? seems likely to dwindle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too clear . All the brilliance of its debate is dimmed by unsound premises ; the shining pyramid of its theory towers uneasily over quicksand . One can imagine it flaring up for a few years as a smart sensation , lasting perhaps as long as its lamentable predecessor , Art Nouveau , then sinking as inevitably and as permanently into that limbo which has always been reserved for forgotten fashions . Yet its virtues need not be lost simply because they have been overstated , or the good in it neglected because it falls short of perfection . It is possible to conceive of a compromise between this house , which is too like an automobile , and to-day 's house , which is too like " an old stage-coach full of tuberculosis " ; a compromise that might advance the cause of good architecture and still remember man 's limitations . The art of building can learn much from Le Corbusier in rapid and economical construction , and in the eternal beauty of simplicity . There are liberal forces working to-day which will know how to profit by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and without sensationalism , toward a progress more lasting than any fashion . They have already shorn eclecticism of many of its excesses . In time their cautious advance may bring the development of a distinctive American style , linked with the past as man 's mind is always linked , but no longer slavishly bound to it . One may see the beginnings , perhaps , of such a style in the Far West , where architects have fused elements once Spanish or Italian into something that is neither of these , but Californian , made for brown hills and ocean and unending sunshine ; something barely touched by archaeology , engagingly simple and invitingly direct . There is no need , then , to fear because Machine Modernism is too extreme that the Olde English Half-timbered Suburb must go on forever , and the Corinthian Order swagger down the years to the end of time . Architecture will not stand still always , even though this one pull was too sudden and ill-balanced to move it .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
