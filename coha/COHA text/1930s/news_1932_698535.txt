txt Compulsory systems of unemployment reserve funds , by which individual companies assume responsibility for the unemployment , of their own work forces , are proposed by the Interstate Commission on Unemployment in a report made public today by Gov . Joseph B , Sly . Under the commission 's plan , designed to shift more of the burden of unemployment , from the individual worker to the industry which employs him , unemployment funds would be built up from contributions by employers amounting to 2 per cent of their pay rolls . in proposing such setups , the commission voluntarily side-stepped the conventional plan of Tooling funds which , it believed , tended to influence uneconomic practices . Representatives of the governors of seven slates comprise the Interstate Commission . They are Mr. Leo Wolman , chairman , of New York ; Mr. Charles R. Blunt of New Jersey , Mr. A. Lincoln none of Massachusetts , Mr. C. A , Kulp of Pennsylvania , Mr. W. M. Leiserson of Ohio , Mr. W. J , Conner of Connecticut . Mr. Daniel P. was selected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend the meetings . Tim commission 's entire plan Is based on its recommendation that compulsory state-wide systems of unemployment reserves be established by a 2 per cent levy on pay rolls . Supplementary to this proposal the commission advised that " payments made by each employer shall constitute the unemployment reserve of his firm , that the maximum rate of benefit shall be 50 per cent of an employee 's wage or $10 a week , whichbver is lower , and the maximum period of benefit shall be 10 weeks within any 12 months , and that the financial responsibility of an employer shall be strictly limited by the amount of his unemployment reserve . " When the accumulative reserves exceed $50 for any one employee , the employer 's contribution would be reduced to 1 per cent of his pay loll .. A $75 reserve , per employee , would enable the employer to cease contributions until the reserve should fall below that figure again . The last three proposals of the commission provided that the state act as custodian , investor and disbursing agent of the funds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment service and finally that unemployment authority shall form stabilization agencies . The Ohio representative , ' although signing the report , filed a separate statement disagreeing with the commission 's conclusions that pooling of contributions may not be better than a plan of separate , plant reserves .
