Last week three professors employed respectively by California , Washington and Stanford Universities informed the people of Oregon that their Chancellor of Higher Education , William Jasper Kerr , was totally incapable of educational leadership , that his election was a " stupendous blunder " in the first place , that their State University would never have a " healthy and normal life " until they got rid of him . This blast , a monstrous piece of impertinence on its face , was delivered by the three professors as representatives of that extraordinary organization , the American Association of University Professors . <P> A. A. U. P. speaks with the authority of 12,000 members in 450 U. S. colleges &; universities . Dues range from $1 per year for emeritus members to $4 for active members . Any teacher or researcher in an accredited institution may join . Founded in 1915 to " increase the usefulness and advance the standards and ideals of the profession , " the Association has ever since been strenuously denying that it is a " professors ' union , " that its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its committees range from A to Z , busy themselves with such subjects as " Cooperation with Latin-American Universities , " " Pensions and Insurance , " " University Ethics , " " Depression and Recovery in Higher Education . " But its Committee on Academic Freedom &; Tenure , significantly designated Committee A , almost alone makes News . Committee A does not pull its punches . Its reports are models of courageous investigation and forthright speaking . If the entire profession should ever nerve itself to act as vigorously as this militant minority speaks , it would dispel forever the lay conviction that professors as a class are learned mice . <P> Comprising a cloistered collection of crotchety individualists who mortally dread insecurity , the normal U. S. campus resembles an inactive volcano . Beneath its outward calm there rumble , seethe and surge perpetual gratings of opinion , ripples of backbiting and intrigue , tides of hate and fear . With fortunate exceptions the instructor fears and resents the department head , who fears and resents the dean , who fears and resents the president , who fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passions in private talk , present smiling exteriors to superiors . But occasionally one stiffens his spine , talks back or speaks out in defiance of tradition , ruling beliefs , sacred cows . Then the volcano is apt to erupt , spew him out . Ready for just such an emergency stands A. A. U. P. with its Committee A. <P> The Association acts only on specific complaint , usually one of dismissal without just cause or notice . Last winter it deplored the farce which Huey Long had made of academic freedom in his Louisiana State University , but held its fire because no facultyman had yet dared raise his voice in protest . When a complaint seems worthy of action , Committee A asks A. A. U. P. chapters in neighboring universities to nominate an investigating committee . The committee visits the complainant 's campus , hears both sides firsthand . Sometimes it finds that a sluggard or incompetent has got his just deserts . Sometimes it is able to " work a reconciliation . Only in flagrant cases of injustice does it consign the offending university to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
