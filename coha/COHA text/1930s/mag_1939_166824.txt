Maurice Gustave Gamelin , the tight-lipped little Allied Generalissimo , last week held his first War II press reception for U. S. news correspondents . At the Ecole Militaire he received a delegation including five U. S. by-liners about to be taken up to the Maginot Line for the first time . For the first time silent Soldier Gamelin , 67 , spoke his piece about the fighting . <P> France , he said , is fighting now for a reason precisely parallel to the U. S. 's reason last time . " France was not attacked . But she has taken up arms in defense of a principle . . . that small nations have the same right to live as large nations , if civilization is to endure . " <P> If the news correspondents wished to see action , the one salient to which they should have been sent was Forbach , the French industrial town ( pop . 11,491 ) which is a small counterpart of Germany 's Saarbrcken , five miles northeast . Forbach is outside the Maginot Line and its forts overlook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French push of September brought other artillery up to assist Forbach 's in dominating Saarbrcken , paralyzing its industry . The French retreat in October left Forbach sticking out like a sore thumb . By last week the Germans had brought up hundreds of guns where they could shell Forbach from three sides , boxing it completely . To defend it would be costly in men and munitions . To surrender it would be to give Germany a keen moral victory as well as the practical advantage of getting Saarbrcken 's coal mines and steel mills back into commission . With 150 German shells coming over daily to establish critical ranges , with German planes reconnoitering busily to discover France 's intentions , Forbach promised this week to furnish the Western Front 's first clear-cut action , Generalissimo Gamelin with his first strong stand or first strategic surrender .
