A scant five years after it was founded by San Francisco 's Archbishop Joseph Sadoc Alemany in 1863 , little St. Mary 's College foundered , was saved only when Pope Pius IX appealed to the Brothers of the Christian Schools , a lay order , to take it over . The college burned down in 1894 , rose from its ashes , was razed again by fire in 1918 , made still another fresh start . In 1921 , when it hired Edward Patrick ( " Slip " ) Madigan to coach its football teams , St. Mary 's began an era of prosperity that culminated when it moved , 700 students strong , into a $1,500,000 plant in the Moraga Valley . But last summer , despite Slip Madigan and its football team ( whose expenses ate up all the gate receipts ) , St. Mary 's was sold at auction for $411,150 to a committee of bondholders for default of payments on $1,370,500 in outstanding bonds ( TIME , Aug. 2 ) . That ended its fourth life , but St. Mary 's still had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rev. John Joseph Mitty , marched into the bondholders ' offices , bought back the college for $715,000 . Last week the bells of St. Mary 's rang loud &; clear as a procession headed by Archbishop Mitty marched across its campus before its 450 students , celebrated with pomp &; ceremony the college 's 75th anniversary .
