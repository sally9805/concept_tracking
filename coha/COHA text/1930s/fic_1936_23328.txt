LW 9 .43 ORDER A STORY BY NANCY HALE HE went to herAunt Della 's to cocktails . 0 She did not even mind going to that dark , smoky , gabbling little fiat because she was so happy . She closed the door of her own apartment carefully , with a precise little click , and so little a thing as that noise ministered to her sense of security , of beauty , and well-being . She ran down the three flights of stairs to the street . When the came out into the light May twilight her heart lifted even higher in her chest and she walked along with long , exact steps , feeling the degree of her slimness , her firmness , of her own inner and outer perfection . The May air was as delicate as scent . She bought a great bunch of dead-white tulips with pale-green short stems , from a cart that crept along the street loaded with red and white and yellow flowers . She took them with her , although she knew that they would not mean anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as she walked was a necessary part of the way she felt . She felt as if everything lovely in the world belonged to her and would come to her , one lovely thing at a time . When the door opened she saw in a second that her Aunt Della 's flat was just as it always was , blue with cigarette smoke , full of talking people holding cocktails ; but it did not seem to touch her sense of the perfection of her life . In that same second the summation of her happiness came to her : her life had been for three years now , ever since she wastwenty-two , completely her own , and it was arranged in her own way to be lovely , reasoned , and precise ; in the middle of it moved herself  --  invulnerable ; she was invulnerable to the things that she did not want in her life . This came to her so whole that she did not stop another second to think about it . She smiled out of her deep safety and pleasure and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of loose wrinkles and her mouth was loose and flexible and red as she talked , holding Olivia 's hand , taking the tulips with her free hand , asking questions and answering them herself and casting little disorganized glances round at her other guests ; all the time pushing a little at Olivia to bring her into the center of the room and of the people . Olivia felt her own pulse beating slowly and unshaken in the midst of this hurly-burly ; none of it claimed her or disturbed that calm beat of her own fastidious blood . She was able to look at her aunt 's twisting face and think about her , about her disordered life , the three husbands she had married from confused ignorance of what she did want , the unbalanced tempo of her days that were not even lived systematically in reverse , but had no settled time for waking , no appointed time for anything ; nothing in Della 's life was decided . She was fifty now , and she had never made any design for her life . The force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with vulnerable naked emotion , for everything that had ever happened to her . She herself , if there had ever been any deep , hard little core of individuality that was Della herself , had never had any hand in the making of her life . Chance , attraction , hate , necessity , these had gavel ned all her years . " She 's had to follow her life around and go where it led her , " Olivia thought and shuddered . " She 's never owned even a little part of it . " Now she was introducing people to Olivia . Olivia sat down on a small armchair and held a gin cocktail that smelled unpleasant . Her face smiled with its own delicate gaiety at the people who said things to her , and pretty soon she set the cocktail down on a table and gave it a little push . While people talked she took a small glance at her wrist . Her watch seemed to have stopped half an hour before ; it was surely more than five o'clock . Olivia 's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shook it a little beside her ear . " You should n't have put butter in the works , " a deep voice said , very low , behind her . Olivia was enchanted ; she did not turn round . " But it was the best butter , " she murmured . No further sound came from behind her , and she did not look round . She continued to say " yes " to the circle of young men who sat before her eyes . Delia hurried up , grasping the train of her teagown in one hand , starting an introduction in a raised voice while she was still some distance from Olivia . Behind her walked a very tall young man , very thin , with smooth dark hair and brilliant blue eyes and an expression of calm and delight . " How do you do , " he said in the same deep voice that had spoken behind her . In front of all the other young men he said , " Shall we go over to those chairs by the screen , where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own calm and delight . Neither of them ever referred to the conversation about the watch . Looking at the brown , tight-drawn shape of his face as they talked , Olivia wondered what things in his life made him look so sure and so delighted and , moreover , so calm ; but she knew that basically his look must come from that same secret she knew herself , a control over life and a well-exercised power of discrimination . She felt an agreeable sense of being in league with her own kind , and she was sure that he must feel it too . She knew that he would never ask her why she looked sn happy , and that she would never ask him , and that the wordless acceptance of each other 's obvious power was another part of their both being strong and fortunate and fastidious . His name was Bertram Grainger . He had long legs and below his trouser cuffs thin sharply cut ankles , and he had large thin hands , and all of him was lean and ordered . The dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been drawn with pencil on the skin . Every movement he made had a neatness that came from strength ; he leaned his elbows on his knees and looked with his face of delight at Olivia . " What do you do ? " he asked . " I mean , for instance , what did you do last night ? " " I gave a party . " " I know about you . I 'm sure there were n't too many people , nor too much to eat , and that awful people did n't stay on and on after you wanted them to go . " " It was rather a nice party . We walked out on the little terrace and looked up , not down , at the city lights . You know what I mean . " " You mean you do n't like pent-houses . Neither do I. I wish I had been at your party . . . and I 'm sure you did n't have any uninvited guests horning in , that kind of thing . " " No . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , good heavens ! " " What ? " " I 'd forgotten something . How perfectly disgusting of me ! Oh , I hate people who do things like this . " " It ca n't be very bad , " he said . He smiled at her , looking pleased , delighted , and approving . " I 'll tell you . Vincent de Gramont brought an old man to the party , a nice old thing who said he 'd known my mother . He was a dear old thing , clever and pleasant and old-school . He asked if he might come to tea to-day and I said he could , and he must be there now . It all went completely out of my head . Oh , the poor thing ! How sickening of me . " " Well , I 'm hardly sorry you did forget . I should n't have met you . " " I 'll simply have to go right back and hope that he 's waited , thinking I was late . I hate that . I hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hate worse having people think I forget things . " " I do n't . I told you I know all about you . I can feel the kind of life you make for yourself . " " Well . . . good-by . I must hurry . " " I suppose you must . Good-by . " She shook his hand quickly and smiled up at him , feeling a wave of pleasure that he did not urge her to stay , that he recognized so instantly the nature of obligations . She drew on her gloves , glancing about for Della . " May I telephone you ? " He was behind her shoulder , speaking in a low , quiet voice , not trying to distract her attention . " Yes , certainty , do . " She smiled at him again , reached for Della 's passing hand , and left . He was there , The maid gave Olivia his card as she came in the front door . " Mr. Draper Phillips . " He sat , a little hunched over , on Olivia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terrace , smoking , and he got up and took her hand when she came in . His face was wry and clever , wrinkled like a strong old crab-apple 's . " I thought you had quite forgotten me . Perhaps I bored you , asking myself to tea . " " No . . no . . not at all . Of course I had n't forgotten . I was detained and I am so sorry to be late . You must forgive me . " " Forgive you ? My dear young lady , I quite understand . You young people to-day are so hectic , your lives go round at such a rate . . . . Of course I understand . It was exceedingly kind of you to come at all . " Olivia dropped down beside him on the sofa and waved at the maid to bring tea . " Mr. Phillips , please do n't think of me like that . I promise you I am not at all hectic . I am really a very punctual person ! This is a dreadful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you must n't apologize ! Why , it 's charming ! You have the charm of children  --  forgetful , selfish , but completely enchanting . " " Oh , do n't say that 1 hope I 'm not a bit like a child . " " You 're very young not to want to be a child , my dear . " He smiled at her keenly , and she somehow disliked his look . He thought he understood her , he thought her silly and disordered and pretty . But she was so sorry for what she had done , and so ashamed , that she only wanted to assuage his hurt feelings by being as pleasant as she possibly could . Tea came , and she spread out her skirts and poured out his cup , smiling at him with more intentional charm than she usually felt it necessary to produce . She thought he looked old and lonely , as though most of his friends had died and as though he had n't much of a life . And he was such a clever man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporaries had outgrown . " You look a bit like your mother , my dear . That is a very great compliment . Such a fascinating person , beautiful and brilliant and with such lovely calm . I wonder if you to-day understand at all the attraction of calm in women . " " Oh , I do , I do . I detest confusion . " He smiled a little wryly and bowed , and she saw that he did not believe her . She thought for a second of how much calmer she was than her mother . She knew that . Her mother had no grip on her inner life , with all her languid manner . Olivia shook her head a little . Somehow it seemed important to her that Draper Phillips should see what she really was . This misconception was intolerable . She set down her cup , lighted a cigarette , and sat back against the cushions , determined to be entertaining , delightful , and calm . She realized that her air on entering must have been flurried ; she had felt flurried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smooth course of her ordered life . Certainly she was entertaining , for he stayed . He stayed really far too late , until she had little time to dress for dinner , and then got up to go . " I hope you 'll forgive my staying , " he remarked . " I did want to see something of you , and you rather forced me to make it late rather than early , you know . " " I am sorry . " " But you must n't excuse yourself . This has been far more pleasant  --  this pretty twilight and your view and yourself in this light , which is much the most seductive of the day . May I come again ? " " I hope you will . I promise to be not a moment late . " " But you do n't understand ! That 's charming , your light-heartedness , your lateness . It 's irresistible . " She got up and gave him her hand . " Perhaps you 'll come to tea to-morrow , " she said quickly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at her . " I should be enchanted , " he said . A telephone call from Bertram Grainger woke her the next morning . She rolled over in the wide low bed to take the telephone , smiling to herself . The sunshine streamed in and lay on the floor in wide stripes , the pale-green satin coverlet lay tumbled on the bed , the maidwas bringing in a tray with orange juice and steaming coffee , and Olivia felt her blood coursing in calm and health through her long slim body . He asked her to dine with him that night , and she agreed to , and hung up still smiling , in pleasure at this new instant understanding , wherein there was no nonsense about pretending previous engagements out of vanity . She arranged her day so that not one thing should detain her from being established on her little white sofa at five o'clock . And at five o'clock Draper Phillips was shown in , and she was on the sofa , in a thin black teagown , smiling and gay and composed . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no bones about declaring his admiration for her beauty , her way of thinking , her surroundings , herself . It was really not unpleasant to have an old man , and such a polished and brilliant man , paying one clever compliments . Only he stayed . He was so diverting that the time went quickly , but she knew that he was staying too long . However , it was a sharp , sick little shock when Bertram Grainger came into the room , and she knew it must be half-past seven . It was messy , it was embarrassing , and to Olivia shameful to find herself still having tea with one man when another man , and particularly this man , came to take her out to dinner ; to be not as yet dressed , to have managed the time in such a disorderly way . " I am so sorry , " she said and held out her hand . It will take me a second and no more to dress . " Phillips got up and shook Grainger 's hand . " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this lovely young lady 's time to such a late hour , " he said and laughed . " I 'll go quickly . The time goes like magic here . " He bowed to Olivia and went . " Is that your dear old man ? " Bertram asked . He seemed very tall , very straight , and thin . " He 's almost quite dreadful . He stays so long ! " " I would have thought no one could stay with you after you wished them gone , " he said , smiling a little . " I 'll dress , " she said and fled . Fled really because she was so disgusted with this uncharacteristic incident . She thought with a wave of what was almost temper of Phillips ; he was the cause of this , and yet he was certainly an entertaining old thing , and besides Grainger was right , she should have been capable of disposing of him just when she pleased . Olivia did n't like herself . But when she came back into the little drawing-room in cool gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her smooth , shining hair and her quiet hands , her throat long and white and her face as calm and gay as a mask with a beautiful mouth , she felt her own self again . When she saw the way Grainger looked at her , his delighted admiration and his calm appreciation , she knew that she was her real self . She had never had such a happy evening in her whole life . She was with someone who gave the same worship to order as she did herself , who loved beauty , restraint , precision as she did . She felt it every minute , and she saw that he felt it : when they rose together from a table , in what was almost athletic co-ordination , when they walked down a theater aisle together without stumbling or halting , but slowly , easily , with a joint rhythm ; when they danced together , perfectly . When he took her home he came in and had one small nightcap and left neatly without lingering . He looked at her for a moment as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightly . " Of course all this is perfectly unbelievable , " he said and smiled with that calm delight and went . She knew with joy what was going to happen , laid out before her as beautifully and precisely as the pattern of a minuet . Without wildness , without misunderstanding or confusion or cancerous emotion , they were going to sec each other very often , and then he would ask her to marry him , and then they would be married , and then they would live a delightful life . Her heart did not miss a single beat , but it felt warm with the pleasure of the prospect , a prospect exquisite and formal . They did see each other often . Within two weeks they had dined together five times , at restaurants and once in Olivia 's small silver dining room ; they had seen plays , they had danced , they had lunched on a Sunday in the country at an inn with an orchard full of apple blossoms , they had taken a long walk in the dusk along the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Jersey on a ferry to look at the New York lights through the May night . They were very happy and they were very gay , and they agreed about an astounding number of things ; but they were not as happy as Olivia had thought that they would be . The pattern of their accord was not as stylized ; and that was Draper Phillips ' fault . He would not leave her alone . He was there in her apartment waiting when they came back from their East River walk expecting to have tea . He telephoned on three evenings when they had returned from the theater and were having a drink and wanted to come round to talk . He wrote her letters that were brought in with breakfast , and that gave her a strange , uneasy feeling , although they were very polished , amusing letters ; but there were too many of them , and she began to dread the arrival of her breakfast tray , to fear the sight of that stiff , old-fashioned penmanship on an envelope . He even sent brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him at the Plaza , to meet him in an hour for a hansom-cab drive in the Park  --  humorous little invitations . Draper Phillips forced the consciousness of his existence into every hour of Olivia 's days . She knew the feeling Bertram had about it . After one of those late-at-night telephone calls he said , " Look here , do you want to see this man ? I do n't see why he has to be after you so much if you do n't , " " Of course I do n't , " she said firmly . " I did think he was a rather pleasant old man , but I do n't think so any more . He makes me uncomfortable . I wish he 'd leave me alone . " " A woman can always make a man leave her alone if she chooses , " he said , and his eyebrows went up a little . She knew what he thought of people who were unable to order their lives according to their own design . She thought the same thing herself  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been her pride . But she did not see what to do about Phillips . She had already given what she had always supposed was an ultimate dismissal ; on one of the afternoons when he had dropped in at teatime and surprised her , she had said to him after a moment 's silence , " Mr. Phillips , I do n't want to see you so often , I 'm afraid . You 're making it rather uncomfortable for me , you know . " " But you 're charming ! " he had cried , and his eyes gleamed with humor in his wryly wrinkled face . " Your generation is unique ! You do what you please , you say what you please  --  you tell an old codger you do n't want to see him so often ; but what are you going to do if the old codger simply can not deny himself the pleasure of seeing you ? " " You do n't understand , " she said coolly , although some new thing , some panic , some fury , suddenly beat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy seeing you . It 's been very pleasant to meet one of mother 's old friends , but I am very busy , and I ask you not to embarrass me by calling me up , writing to me , so often . " " Oh , my dear , my dear , " he laughed . " That sort of thing is n't natural to you , I know . I know all about you young things . Embarrassed  --  my dear , you 're talking out of a novel of my times . You must remember that I am an old man . You must let me have my pleasures , and seeing you is such a great pleasure . Do n't be afraid , I sha n't attack you , you know " ? and his eyes crinkled and nearly shut with his mirth . Terrible , real fury took Olivia by the heart . She hardly knew what she was doing . She jumped to her feet , and the voice that came from her was loud and confused and frantic . " Do n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you please go away . I do n't want to see you , ca n't you understand ? " She ran to her room , pulling the door shut after her , and threw herself on her bed with her heart pounding . She heard him go out and the front door shut , through a blurred roaring in her ears , of rage and annoyance and impotence . After a while she got to her feet and looked in the mirror . Her face was hardly her own . It was flushed and wild and the eyes were strained . She bathed in cold water and forced herself to move slowly and to think of nothing , and gradually brought her face back to its own calm , pale , masklike shape . When Bertram called to take her to dinner , she was still and ordered and gay , and her hair curved in smooth shapes back from her cool forehead . But inside her a frightening new panic trembled ; she would not let him come in later in the evening for fear of one of those terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the telephone bell tinkle another time . She knew that she was hurried and confused when she said , " No . . . no , I do feel rather tired , I think I 'll go right to bed . " He said , " Yes , of course , " but she knew that he looked at her with astonishment and distaste . He saw that she was disturbed and afraid of something , not the calm , sure person that he had met at De/la 's that afternoon . When she went into her bedroom , half crying with irritation and frustration , there was a long white box on her bedside table . It held dozens of white tulips , and a card that said , " My dear , you are even more charming when you are angry . Lose your temper again soon ! Draper Phillips . " Olivia screamed and tore the card across ; she clapped her hand over her mouth and her eyes grew wide with horror at herself . She threw herself across the bed , as she had earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slim body from side to side and felt her eyes grow hot and swollen . She thought of Bertram , and he seemed something pure and tall and like beautiful marble , something that she wanted and admired , something that she had felt herself to be like until lately , while now . - She visualized herself with real disgust , crying , screaming , uncontrolled , furious , swollen-faced , shaking with the incapacity to put her own life in order . She stopped her crying sharply , rolled over on her back , and stared dully at the ceiling . How could she get rid of that terrible old man ? How could she get rid of that terrible old man ? How could she get rid ? . . . She threw her arms straight up toward the ceiling . She knew that Bertram would never ask her to marry him while he thought her life confused with other things . He was the sort of man who would want the woman he loved to clear her life for him to come into , to show that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment to say anything about love unless he knew that his love was wanted and would be as purely returned . Besides , he hated messiness , he hated confusion and clutter and incompetent living  --  and that was why Olivia loved him . She loved him because he was the first man she had seen in her three years of independent living who wanted the very ordered , precise life that she wanted herself . There were a few people in the world who understood the exquisite beauty of order and control , and to be one of them was the most desirable thing in the world . But not to be able to order one 's own life , to be overridden helplessly with things one did not want ... Olivia was crying again now , and hating herself for her futile , silly , hopeless tears . In her pain and confusion she made a resolve , and carried it out the next daywhen she lunched at a small French restaurant with Bertram . They sat on a small semi-circular balcony with an ironwork rail and ate a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bits . A formal garden lay below them between three neat brick walls , and behind that hung an improbable backdrop of sheer spires and towers , faint through the May haze . They sat and ate slowly , as decorously as beautiful figurines , and they laughed and talked and turned their heads in a lovely formal rhythm . Olivia could not help but feel how decorative they were together , wherever they sat . She longed to straighten out that one bit of herself that was confused , and belong entirely to the beautiful order they made together . She took one more spoonful of soup and began that attempt she had planned . " Bertram , what is one to do about people who do n't respond properly to being put in their places ? I mean people to whom one 's A , B , and C mean some other letters , so that one is n't understood . That Phillips man , that old man , I told him yesterday that I did n't want to see him any more , and as far as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can one do ? " He looked at her rather coldly with his bright blue eyes that were outlined in black by his eyelashes . " I have n't the faintest idea what women do about such matters . I 'm sure that someone like you can put anyone you choose in his place . That really is sort of your problem , is n't it ? ... Would you like to drive out into the country this afternoon ? " With all her strength she put gaiety and lightness into her look as he answered . She knew she was a fool , and saw quickly and too late the stupidity of her question . In that little league of perfectionists  --  the ones who could and did arrange their lives  --  there was no asking other people how to do it . You either could and did , or you could n't and did n't . No one else could help you . She found some bravery from being with Bertram , a sort of infection of new strength , and she knew that she must find some way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had met Bertram she had not found a way . She knew that she was in love as she had always wanted to be in love , beautifully and with taste and restraint and delight , and , except for one grinding inner disturbance , with calm . In the mornings when she woke she used to think how happy she would be if she had never heard of Draper Phillips , how precise and perfect the rest of her life was , with the things she wanted arriving in a measured tempo , one by one . She thought of Phillips with hate and loathing  --  hot , blurred emotions that were a disgrace to her philosophy . She detested the part of herself that could be so disturbed by his thickskinnedness , that could become so inflamed with savage , disorderly rage at him . She told her maid that he was never to be admitted at any time ; she instructed her to readdress his letters to the club where he lived ; she threw his telegrams into the waste-basket unopened . She continued to feel uneasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never really calm any more . It was nearly June , and it smelled already like June , when she dined one night with Bertram late , on a roof that overlooked the city . The long French windows behind the tables opened at intervals on a narrow terrace , and in the black warm night the lights hung and dangled in white festoons like diamond jewelry . They ate a little cold soup , an artichoke , strawberries in white wine , and danced . It was an unbelievable thing , dancing together . It was music itself and rhythm and cool emotion and perfection . The orchestra played the best of the old dance tunes , and they danced again and again , talking very little . The orchestra played " Dancing in The Dark " and they danced , and the lights in the room turned low to mauve and purple shadows , and Bertram held Olivia close to him and danced . After that they went back to the table and sat and looked quietly at each other as if something important had happened . He reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the top of hers as it lay on the table . She looked at her hand , slim and pale with white rings , and then she looked up at him and he was smiling at her with his clear , delighted blue eyes . " Darling Olivia , you are perfectly lovely . " Her small gay face smiled back . " I do want to talk to you . Can we go and sit on your terrace ? " Now she was once more really calm , as she had not been for so long , and happy . Now she knew the progression of events before her , she had the knowledge of where things moved which was as right as the terrible fear of unexpected and uncontrollable events was wrong . She knew how they would go back , how they would climb the circular stairs , how they would sit on the railed terrace ; she knew the white wine and seltzer they would drink , she knew the question he would ask her and the answer she would give . An exquisite pleasure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They drove through the dark summery streets to her small door with its yellow light . They ascended the circular staircase in leisure , talking . As she unlocked the door with her key she turned toward him and smiled with calm happiness , and again he touched her lifted hand with his . She looked at his gay blue eyes , loving him particularly because she knew he would not try to kiss her until he had asked her to marry him . They went into the apartment . On the little white sofa , smoking , sat Draper Phillips . " What are you doing here ? " she cried and stopped short in the doorway . Suddenly all the rage and the confusion , the hate and hot violence , flooded back into her blood , stronger than she had ever felt them . She felt that she was shaking all over . " Waiting for you , my dear . I hoped you would n't be long . Mr. . . Grainger , I hope you 'll forgive my sharing the lovely Olivia with you for part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling at them with his clever , wry face , wrinkled and diabolical and invincible and old . Olivia stared at him . Her heart pounded wildly and her hand clenched and she was burning hot . " How dare you come here again ! Will you get out of here ? I do n't want you here ! Get out ! Get out ! " Dimly , through a red film , she knew that her voice was a scream . " My sweet , " the old man said smoothly , " I can not tell you how it flatters me to see that I inspire so much emotion in someone as lovely and young as yourself . You are perfectly lovely . . . is n't she , Mr. . . . Grainger ? " She heard Bertram , behind her , catch his breath with a sharp , hissing sound . " Perfectly , " he said . " Olivia , this evening has been delightful . Thank you so much . Good night . " " Good night , " she echoed vaguely . She heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a man to leave you now instead of getting to work and throwing me out , " said the old man with a chuckle . " If I 'd been he , I 'd have kicked me all the way down stairs . " " He 's not like that , " she found herself saying stupidly . " No , he 's a precious sort of a young fellow . Sit down , wo n't you ? You look tired . " She sat down . " There . You do look lovelier when you 're tired and when you 're angry than when you 've that hard little mask . " " How did you get in here ? " " Bribed your maid of course . Tactics of the 90 's . Rather efficient . " " I . . I hate you . I hate you . Oh , my God , I hate you ! " " I do n't mind , you know . " " I do n't care what you mind . I do n't caret " " You are a passionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thoroughly enchanting . Will you marry me : " What ? " " I 'm exceedingly well off , you know , and I do n't think you 'd find me dull , although I am certainly too old for you . I do n't seem to leave you unmoved , although your emotion is mostly hate . Well . . . Naturally my desire is purely selfish . I want you because you are lovely to see , to touch . " He put out a hand and touched her arm . " You loathsome old thing ! " she cried out loudly and put her hand over her mouth . She did not know herself at all any more . She dug her nails into her palms and gasped deep into her lungs for breath . " Will . . . you . . . please .. . go away now ? You 've succeeded in ruining everything . " " Have I really ? What fragile , what  --  vulnerable creatures you young people are , to be sure . Well , good night , my dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heard him close the outer door behind him . She waited for some sensation of relief , and none came . All her thoughts were wild and confused . She had lost something she wanted very much , but she could hardly assemble what it was , what it meant . She wanted .. . calm ; and that seemed the farthest , most unattainable thing on earth . Control was lost , and she felt she would never have it back any more . Bertram was lost ; self-respect was lost ; beauty and order were lost . How could she get them back ? I . . . do n't . . . know , she thought . She had fallen into a rhythm of disturbance , confusion , and she felt she could never , never step out of that rhythm again . She could not put her thoughts in any order at all . Bertram seemed far away and cold and strange , and thinking of him was like half-remembering something Long ago . Half-dispassionately , half as if she did not care , she thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and realized that , having worn that look , he would never come back . That was no moment 's annoyance ; that was the judgment of a way of life upon another , disorderly way of life . Bertram 's look was full of distaste , unkind ; she thought suddenly , queerly , that Bertram was unkind . He had no patience , no tolerance with the lack of order ; and his ordered philosophy was something frigid , sterile  --  so unkind , so profoundly unkind . . .. She supposed that she was an unkind person too . She perceived , dimly and without caring , that there was no exquisiteness , no extreme order , combined with kindness or with gentleness of heart . Her thoughts were tiny and remote . What was recent and real was terrible rage , terrible emotion . She felt limp and faint .
