txt The proposed tax of the Chilean government on exports of copper would prove a heavy burden on two large American copper producers . Anaconda Copper Mining Co. and Kennecott Copper Corp . Anaconda probably would be the more seriously affected since it is the largest operator in that country , owning the Chile Copper Co .. located in the Province of Antofagasta and the Andes Copper Mining Co located in the Province of Atacame . Kennecott operates the Braden Mine near Sewell . Chile . Some in the trade hold out the hope that the proposed tax , although already passed by the lower house , may be modified before it receives the more conservative Chilean Senate 's approval . The impact , of course , will depend on the world price and on volume of production . However , figures available for past years indicate that while Anaconda would be hit hard by the tax , at anything like current world prices there would seem to be basis for profitable Chilean operations . Chile Copper Co. reported shipments of 360,122,138 pounds of copper for 1937 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating cost of around five cents a pound . Andes Copper , the other Chilean unit of Anaconda , had shipments during the same year of 116,711.843 pounds at expenses of $6,974,252. which made costs around six cents a pound . The two companies play an important part in Anaconda's-production , accounting for around twothirds of that company 's output . It is estimated that the cost of producing copper at Kennecott 's Braden mine is less than seven cents a pound . Chile Copper Co. itself owns no mining properties or plants . Its 100% owned subsidiary , Chile Exploration Co. , owns mining rights , easements , concessions and claims on lands in Chile which terminate upon the permanent abandonment of the mining operations . In the case of the Andes Copper Mining Co. , the mining concessions are perpetual so long as the company pays annual taxes .
