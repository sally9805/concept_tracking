txt Workmen last night cleaned the haggard face of the new County Court House . With brooms and hose they washed down the steps , and with mops attacked the hallways . They cleaned up old papers , icecream boxes , cigar stubs and trampled roses . Two days of pushing mobs and crowds , of near riots and public orations , had extracted their sad toll . But today it will be ready to return to justice again . The holiday was over . The crowds of the second day of Mayor Walker 's appearance before the Hofstadter committee were neither so large nor so vociferous as of the first . But they still were large and loud . Once again they stood for hours In the sun , waiting for a sight of the city 's chief executive , and for the moment in which they could express a personal opinion about it ail . They did not try to fight their way into the hearing room with such strength , but there still were about two people for every normal seat . A Slight Change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight change on the part of the crowd was noted . There was a lowering of cheers for the Mayor , and a slight elevation of the hisses . Judge Seabury , too , found his applause less cluttered with collective negatives than it had been the day before , perhaps because there were 3,000 fewer persons present . Even inside the hearing room there was an air of politeness where chaos had been before . It was so marked , indeed , that the crowd was complimented by the chair . But he should have waited . Just afterward some of the leading characters made speeches , and the applause from the rear was as wild as in any previous hour . Senator Hofstadter , banging with his gavel , delivered loud threats . The tumult and the shouting kept on . The entrances and the exits of Mayor Walker and Mr. Seabury were the main moments of the day so far as the multitude cared . They both received ovations from friends ; the former accepted it with a smile and the latter with dignity . The cheering would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hearing room or the street , , axid.then parallel the man as he went in or out . The rotunda was just as crowded as ever and the echo there made the racket seem greater than it really was . For the most part the citizens of the city who had no friends to give them signed passes , no hope of ever against the jury box and appeared amused . The chairman used the gavel and when the crowd subsided the hearing went on . A few moments later Mayor Walker made a statement about " innuendos , " and once again the crowd broke loose. % Cheers Follow Him Out . There was a further outburst when Mr. Seabury nodded and the two halves of a question about checks and cash went into the record so phrased as to draw inferences . The Mayor objected , the minority objected and the whole thing was read out by the stenographer . Back in the crowd came a prolonged " Oh , " sounding like the beginning of the Undertaker Song in the Yale Bowl .

At the doorway as he passed through were a dozen women who threw roses at him . Slightly astonished at the floral display , he paused for a moment and then smiled at his admirers . Going down the steps he took off his hat and was soon in his car and away . The crowd mostly went also . Only a few hundred waited in the corridors and outside to watch the departure of Mr. Seabury . Where on Wednesday he had gone home surrounded by policemen and booing , last night he received mild applause . He and some of his assistants got into an automobile and started off up the street .

In place of the thousands of Wednesday there were just hundreds waiting outside an hour before the event was scheduled to start . The arrival of the Mayor was duly celebrated and that of the committee 's counsel . After that many of those who had appeared earlier went away . Only a few stood about the movie cameras , waiting for something to happen . The morning session found the crowd inside with almost enough room . The police had reinforced itself and there were officers in charge . As various points were made by either of the committee 's two factions , its counsel or the witness , there was applause . Finally , the chairman emerged from a recess and announced that at the next burst , of noise the entire group of standees at the rear of the room would , with a wave of the gavel , be eliminated .
