Part of most tourists ' fun in quaint old Nuremberg is shuddering at the medieval torture instruments in its thick-walled Burg ( citadel ) . Last week Nuremberg Storm Troopers revived a medieval custom . They seized a woman convicted of mistreating her stepchild , drove her through the streets with a placard around her neck reading , " I am a liar and an unnatural mother ! " Nurembergers guffawed . Two pictures of the driven woman were printed with approving comments by the local Nazi newsorgan Frnkische Zeitung . The Storm Troopers looked around for another woman to drive in medieval fashion through the streets . They found one accused of murdering her child-but suddenly Nuremberg 's Nazi municipal government intervened . There had been too many letters from British tourists , the Storm Troopers were warned , about that pretty , non-Jewish girl whom they had dragged around town orfe night earlier in the week . Aged only 19 and a typical Gretchen with two long plaits of blonde hair , the girl was seized by Storm Troopers when they found her in company with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure race " ideals , they cut off her blonde plaits , shaved her head , tied a placard around her neck reading " I have offered myself to a Jew " and pinned the plaits to the placard . Until after midnight the girl was dragged from cabaret to cabaret , forced to stand on the stage of each while she was made the butt of vile abuse . No Briton in any of the cabarets was so foolish as to challenge the Storm Troopers at the time but scores of Britons wrote scorching eye-witness letters next day , thoroughly scared the Municipality of Nuremberg which looks to tourists for revenue .
