THE beginning of my life was quite ordinary . I was born a very long time ago* in a country village in Podolia , a former province of the old Polish Republic , which does not belong any more to Poland . The name of the village was Kurylowka . It was one of the most beautiful places in existence . I can not tell you enough about the country  --  the softness and freshness of the air , the picturesque undulating landscape , the soil , and the richness of that . And the beautiful fruit ! The finest orchards I have ever seen were in the place where I was born . Hundreds of acres of fruit trees  --  they were marvelous . It was a joy to me , a small boy . I have recollections still concerning , that , delicious fruit , and how , when it was all gathered together in store , the fragrance that filled the air was still sometimes stronger than the fragrance of the most beautiful flowers . Our home was very far from civilization ; we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little traveling was done was by horse , of course . When I was three years old , I already showed some disposition for music . I was attracted by the piano . I began to play with one finger  --  with one small finger I tried to find the melodies  --  and when I was four , I began already to use all my small fingers . My father was deeply interested in that and wanted to give me some education in that direction . From the beginning he was convinced that I had a great talent , and as he was a man with a strong sense of duty , he considered it his duty not to waste the talent which God had given . At this time my father was administrator of very large estates . His name was John Paderewski  --  Jan , we call it in Polish . He was very artistic in all his tastes . Ho had a feeling for all art . He was a painter , and a sculptor , too , in a modest way . For instance , he used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was , you see , a very pious man  --  extremely pious  --  and from time to time , when he had some leisure , he used to make these little statues , and quite charming they were too . He did it out of his religious feeling , which was very deep . He was musical . Perhaps it was from her that music COMO to me . She was very distinguished in appearance , I have always heard , and very gentle . There is a little picture of her that I shall give you later , which reveals a certain charming quality , as you will see . I started piano by my own intuition . There were no lessons , no effort to teach me . With one finger I was always seeking , always trying to find the melodies , and Ihen , when I was four , ray first teacher  --  a violinist , alas , and , tot a pianist  --  came to give me lessons . That was the beginning , and it was during this time that my father was taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first tremendous happening in my life  --  I was only four years old . My country was always torn with revolution . My first childish knowledge of it was revolution , and it was in the uprising of 1863 that my father was taken to prison . It was very sad and very terrifying to us , and we cried together , my sister Antonina and I. We could not understand it when our father , who was so good , was taken away from us and we were left alone . This revolution brought disaster to my father and his house . He took part , not actively , but always encouraging his friends to participate . Whatever he could do , he did , other than to fight himself  --  for that was against his nature . And so he was arrested and put into prison . It was this revolution of 1863 and ' 64 which ruined many thousands of people in Poland . Many were executed or sent to Siberia ; their properties were confiscated and given away to Russian functionaries . I remember very well what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suddenly the house was surrounded by Cossacks . There was a large company of the Cossacks , perhaps one hundred and fifty , on horseback . They completely encircled our house , and a few of the more intelligent among them , accompanied by a civilian , proceeded in a search , I was frightened , of course , and could not realize then what was going on . So I approached a Cossack very timidly and asked him about my father , because he was the most important thing in our lives . I was rather badly received  --  with the knout . When the Cossacks first surrounded the house , I felt that something terrible was going to happen ; but when they entered the house , then I knew that it was - for my father they had come . I realized the danger . So I ran again to the tallest of the Cossacks , frightened as I was , and cried , " What is happening to my father ? " But he never answered or even looked at me . Then I insisted and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had happened  --  why they were taking my father away , and if he would soon be back again . The tall Cossack laughed when he gave me several very heavy strokes with the knout . First Notes T HIS firstcontact with the Russian authorities will always affect me . First of all , it was very painful , it cut my flesh , but I also considered it a supreme insult  --  in the pride of boyhood , not quite four years old . It wounded my spirit . During the imprisonment of my father , of course , we could not stay at home ; so our good aunt , who was living at a distance of a hundred - mike or more , came to take us , and we stayed with her while our father was away , I think I told you that my first teacher was a violinist . My father had engaged him before he was sent to prison , as there was no other music teacher within reasonable distance . Being a violinist , naturally , he did not himself know anything about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , and said that , although he could not give me any instruction in piano music  --  and evidently I was talented for the piano  --  I could play quite well enough for duets . Duets with my sister were the main object of his lessons . Poor man ! He worked very hard with us , beating time faithfully at the side of the piano with his thin old hands . Now , young as I was , I soon realized that he could do nothing for me ; he could not teach me how to play . So I used to play by myself , improvising . That suited me quite well , for I wanted to play , I was always playing , but I did not want to study . Like every child , my love for music was not so strong as to make me want to work . So the old violin teacher pleased me very well at that time . My father , of course , thought all was well , poor man . The New World of Letters ITRINCl the stay with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I really do not know how . It must have come quite naturally to me , I think , for I do not remember ever learning to read or write . We started with a French governess , and while she was there , I learned to read by myself in Polish , and then , I think by some miracle , I learned Russian too . I could write by the time I was four , because in 1864 I began writing letters to my father in prison , but they were not very interesting letters , I 'm afraid ? just a child 's letters . I remember the first one I wrote him . It was a great effort . It was all about my cousin Florian and his beautiful green boots . It is a tradition among the Polish people to wear with their Polish costumes gay boots of different colors  --  yellow , green , red , and so on . Florian , who was a year older than I , got a pair of these splendid boots , which he displayed on every possible occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first letter to my father was full of news of the green boots ; I could write of noth-ing else ! Your natural conclusion is that I was envious  --  that I wanted a pair myself  --  but. , as a matter of fact , that was not the case . I remember very distinctly , and for the very good reason that I have never envied anyone . No , I have never known envy . This is not a virtue ; it is , perhaps , some lack in my make-up . This has always been true in my life . When , for instance , later in my student days , some boys reached certain good results which made them quite prominent , I used to say to myself , " I am glad , but how is it that . I do not envy them their success ? " And then I would think about it a little and realize that. , perhaps , I , too , could get some good results in the future , even more brilliant than theirs . Such things acted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped later in building my career . My father 's posi-tion was a responsi-ble one ; he had prac-tically to rule an enor-mous tract of land , and had under him thousands of people . He must have been an extremely just and good administrator of all that multitude of servants , because after he was thrown into prison , those poor peasants went in an immense crowd to the headquarters of the district , to make their petition to the government for his release . I like to remem-ber that my father inspired such loyalty . And he continued practicing that equity throughout his whole life in the smallest incident , as you will see when I tell you the following story : Although I was always attracted to the piano as a child . I was even more attracted by Nature , and very fond of climbing trees . I liked to climb trees for the fruits . Fruit was a passion with me . I remember once when I hung myself on a tree , and this is important because I ruined my only good clothes  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not afford them . We lived very far away from a large town where there were shops ; it meant a long journey and sacrifices must be made to get them . The day of my tragedy I had on the beautiful new clothes my father had just bought me , including a particularly beautiful little vest. , and after putting them on , the first thing I did was to climb a tall pear tree filled with unexpected spikes , in pursuit of a magnificent pear at the very top of that perilous tree . I slipped  --  slipped and completely tore my new shirt and beautiful vest , and hung there by the collar , caught by one of the sharp spikes of the tree . There I hung , crying for help . The spike saved me , but destroyed my clothes . The new coat was in rags , the beautiful vest ruined . Life In the Shadow of Death B UT I was not punished by my father  --  not at all  --  and that is the point of this story , and something to note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was led in. weeping and terribly frightened ; I felt that a great punishment was in store . But , to my surprise , he said very quietly , " Well , Ignace , this is a very unfortunate accident you have had  --  very  --  and you have been very careless and very selfish . You have ruined your beautiful new clothes  --  the clothes that have cost so much to buy , and that I have taken so much trouble to get for you . " By this time I was crying more than ever . I stood waiting my doom . " But I am not going to punish you , " my father continued . " No . But you will have to wait a long time before you get another suit . That will be your punishment ; that will be punishment enough . " And then he turned and went out of the room . Ah , this made a deep impression on me then . The petition of the serfs eventually had the desired effect upon the authorities and , after a year or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not see bins for some months after that . Everything was upset then throughout the province . The property he had managed was in receivership . The owners had left . Everything was disorganized , and my father had to luok for another position . What a discouragement that must have been for him ! But he finally got a new post in Wolhynia . It was a little township of only about 2000 population , of whom 1500 were Jews . It was rather a sad place to Live in  --  very sad  --  but one gets accustomed to everything . Our house stood on a small hill overlooking a little pond and a large Jewish cemetery . It was frightful  --  just a few steps from the cemetery ! I was only seven years old , and very impressionable , and at least twice a week I had to see , from our little garden , the funerals of those poor Jews and hear the laments . It was terrible . There was a custom among the Jewish people to go to the cemetery and pray by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women never took part , only the men . These funerals were always accompanied by laments . After the funerals began the long hours of crying . The sound of it was like a great wail rising up into the air . I remember the agonizing picture it made on my childish mind . There was no bier , no coffin . The body was simply wrapped in a large black cloth , and one saw it ( tarried thus on the shoulders of the bearers to the grave . The sight was awful  --  very sinister and terrible . Then they buried the body and went home , and a few hours later the women came and began their laments over the grave . They prayed and prayed , and from time to time cried out , even shouted , with such an expression of pain , of agony . It went on for hours . The wails still linger in my ears . My father was always trying to get another house , but it was not possible . Whenever he applied for a house , that house was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent him from having it . We spent several years of our childhood in that depressing place . Every detail of it is stamped on my memory forever . When I was a very little boy I was very boisterous and always ready for any mischief . It lasted for a few years only , because when I was seven I was melancholy and always thinking about death , and I was afraid of being buried alive . I think the Jewish cemetery and funerals really affected me deeply . All my boyhood was influenced by that depressing memory . I was the only boy in the family ; I had no playmates and my sister was my only companion . We amused ourselves as best we could , but there were not very many resources for amusement under such circumstances . My Sister , Antoreina I WANT to tell you a little about my sister , Anto- 1 nina . She is two years older than I. She was also of a sad disposition . I think she was just as affected as I by that neighborhood . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not very ambitious . Ambition develops with age , of course , and later on she became more serious , but I had the ambition of the family then . We played together  --  duets  --  but we played only when the teacher was there ; otherwise we had no desire to sit down and play by ourselves . My sister Antonina was a sad little girl , very fond of crying  --  a privilege of her sex . When I was a small boy I was a great friend of horses , and when I was about seven years old I had a horse of my own . He was my only companion . I used to ride him without a saddle . We were very good friends and I felt toward him as though he were my brother . I loved him very much . And whenever I got any sweets , some particular delicacy , I never failed to go at once to my horse to partake of that little feast with him . On one occasion  --  it was a feast day in the family  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hurried to share them with my dear horse . He ran quickly toward me and ate greedily , profusely , from my hands , and then suddenly , without warning , turned and hit me in the stomach with his hind legs so terribly that I fell down as dead , and remained unconscious for hours . And there they found me  --  after a long search , in the meadow , quite unconscious . ( Continued OR Page sot 52 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST January 2-5,1037 ( C  --  ntittried from Page 50 ; strange , because I did not like to concentrate on music . I did not receive any proper musical education as a child and what was given me , in the form of pretended education , bored me terribly . I had no interest for the playing of eternal duets . The only enjoyment I could find was in my improvising . In eonneetion with that lack of musical memory , it is very curious that I had , for instance , a great memory for figures . When I was a small boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind with great ease . My want of memory as a musician then was a great drawback to me . My first memory for music was absolutely oral . 1 could remember those things that I had Seer &; My memory for poets and fissures was visual . I could remember easily the things that I rend . The third memory . which is , for a musician , the principal one , the surest of all , his automatic memory , the memory of the reflexes  --  that was lacking then . That third memory developed when I learned how to play . When a boy , I could not concentrate . except on things which I liked . . R Memory That Played Tricks I often played chess with my father . I could easily play two or three games at . once front memory . without the chessboard . Now I would not remember one single figure . When a boy of ten , I could play I he game from another room without even seeing the pieces , my father playing and I dictating my moves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that time I could not memorize music at all . I do not know how to account for that , except that I had emotion for mesh-then , but no memory . It was then that I began to read the Russian newspapers . I was the reader for the family . About this time a great change came in my surroundings , and this event happened when I was about eight years old . My father married again in 1867 , and I acquired stepmother . He had married into a large family , it seems . There were many brothers and sisters , and it was a great change , heeanse then many people ' same to our house . We were constantly surrounded with people , after being entirely alone for so many years . They were poor , and my father supported them all . My stepmother was very kind , a good woman ; and , especially with me , she was very sweet. , but she did not make herself very popular with my sister . She was not . at . all artistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather a nice boy , I suppose  --  and I was a boy ! She was very good to me , and many extra sugar plums came my way , very good little cakes . When T was a boy I was very fond of cakes . I still am . But there was always a little friction between my stepmother and my sister . This conflict lasted until the last moment of my sister 's staying at home . They were always opposed to each other ? tem peramen I think  --  and there was no help for it . Aside from my father and stepmother , the majority of the guests of the family were very old people . I was always , as a child , with older people , Besides my father , my stepmother and my sister , there were also my to tor , Ale Babianski , my stepmother 's father , my grandfather , and there was , too , my music teacher , Mr. Sowinski , Those four gentlemen represented about three hundred years . The youngest of them was seventy-eight years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering greatly with his eyes , he was menaced with blindness . It was then that . he would ask me to read or to play lot , him , He would lie on the sofa and listen to the music , and I would play , in the dark , the old cracked piano ; sometimes for several hours . But I enjoyed myself then . My sister never took part in these improvisations , She was reading or amusing herself in some other way , or sometimes quarreling violently with the stepmother , which she also enjoyed . During the long winter evenings I sat there ii ; the dim candlelight , reading the newspapers aloud . This went on for hoe rs every night . But it was really very interesting , very touching . These old men drinking in the news as I read to them . They could nut read a word of Russian and had to depend upon me , because Polish newspapers were forbidden . And there came a moment when the readings brought almost a tt led re ma ? a very serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franco-Prussian War . I was not vet ten years old . I had among my listeners people who even remembered seeing Napoleon . My tutor was still imbued with that Napoleonic spirit , having spent thirty years in France . The rest of the company was absolutely pro-French . France had not done any harm to Poland , while the e rtna ns , the Russiansand the Austrians had all mutilated our cam n try . My little tragedy happened very shortly after the declaration of the Franco-Prussian War in 15 7 0 . Newspapers were the one thing that mat tered , and my father sent the long distance to the neighboring village to fetch them . Winning a . War Singlehanded Well , I would glance at the papers quickly first , and I saw only the most frightful news , the disastrous events of the battlefield . There was no good news to be found anywhere for these poor old men . What was I to do ? I had not the courage to read to them what was really happening , I het thet it would break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitch of excitement and anxiety about the war . There was only one thing In do , I derided . I would read just the opposite of what was really in the newspapers . I made up my mind quickly and , I must confess , I did not have the slightest hesitation . I turned all the bad news into good news . I just improvised , i made a little plan , a little story , and instead of reading what really happened , I sent all the French victorious to the Rhine ! And then there was such enthusiasm ! Suck happiness ! They shouted with delight at the news . Why , on one occasion , when I located the French already at Cologne  --  which was just the opposite from the truth  --  my father sent to the cellar for a bottle of the finest old wine , and to celebrate together , they drank the health of the victors . These old people were actually crying with emotion and  --  well , I was delight ed , delighted ! I continued the readings for several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I hoped for the best . I had some slight hesitation when I started , butt I soon got accustomed to my improvisations , and it was a great pleasure to me . And there was another incentive , or excitement. , too , and that was the overcoming of a difficulty  --  a technical difficulty , because it was , after all , not an easy matter to translate a Russian newspaper into Polish at sight . Russian was not my language , and I had to translate very quickly as I read , without showing the slightest hesitation . So it became a kind of sport  --  a stunt . My father suddenly became much better and went to the town to see the doctor . I knew he would then hear everything . I was caught . I said to myself , " Something serious is going to happen . " So I took all the papers from which I had read such brilliant news of the great French victories and put them into my own little room ready to burnin the oven , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doc-tor , ion ki ngvery serious . Ile sent for me at once . I had never seen him so agitated . e found it diffi-cult even to speak . At last he said , " Well , Ig-nace , where are the newspapers from which you have read such wonderful news to us ? I should like to see them for myself . Bring them to me . " I hurried from the room , only too glad to go . I gathered them rip quickly and put them into the oven and burned them . Then I returned to my father . It was a strange settle . My tutor , the old grandfather and another old gentle-man were gathered around my father . " Ile has lied to us , that boy , ' ' he said , reaming to me . " Lied . He has read its things that were not so . I have just come from the doctor , and he has told me the truth . When I said , ' Thank God . I can now read again of the won-derful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old.men stared at my father , who became more ex-cited . ' ' Yes , lie laughed at me and said , ' What is the matter with you ? Are you mad ? What French victories are you talking about ? ' And then I told him how , every evening , my boy had read to Us the glorious news in the newspapers . ' Glorious news ! Why , that is something fantastic ! There is no glorious news ! It is just the oppo-site that has happened ! The French are beaten everywhere  --  everywhere When I told him he wits mistaken , that the French were already at Cologne , the doctor said , ' You are crazy , my friend , crazy ! You are making of your-self a laughingstock ? ' " The poor old men were stunned at all this . They simply stared at my father , speechless , and then they turned and looked at me . My heart seemed to fall right down through my body . " What have you to say for yourself ? " my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told us ? " " I did not lie , " I cried , " I did not lie . I only read what I hoped  --  what you wanted . " Then my father said , ' ' No more arguing . You deserve a good punishment . " And then and there he gave me a few hard whacks . It was really very painful . I was overwhelmed . My motive was to make them happy . That has always been a very important motive in my life  --  to make other people happy . It began very early , for I can not stand a sad expression on someone 's face  --  I can not . I wish to see everyone happy , smiling and enjoying himself , It was my father 's great pleasure in the evenings after his work when he could call upon me and say , " Well , now , improvise something . " He never had enough of my playing . It seemed to mean a great deal to him . He realized , I believe , even then that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intuition with him ; although ' he had no musical education himself , he understood it .. He realized that I had a future , a line in life , to follow . It comes to me now how often these thoughts and hopes filled his mind , and how be worked and dreamed in his own way to help and accomplish this . A talent God had given could not he wasted . Such was his simple faith in destiny . I used to improvise for hours for my father ; it soothed him and he liked it . And sometimes he was slumbering when he was very tired , but the moment I stopped playing , he would say , " Why did you stop ? " " But , " I said , " I am playing for more than art hour . " " Oh , W011 , just a few minutes more . Go on , my child , go on . " About this period , my sister and I took part in a concert in the neighborhood  --  a little place where there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very great event . I was twelve then  --  it was in ' 72 . My First Concert No , I was not nervous at that . age when playing ; I was never frightened . The fright came later , through the sense of responsibility . At our first little concert we were well received by the audience ; they applauded and we were given some sweets . Then , later on , I played two or three concerts more quite by myself . My sister sat in the audience . There were no more duets this time . I was the soloist , One extraordinary feature of these concerts was that after I had finished my so-called program , someone in the audience , as a great test , came and held a towel over the keyboard , and without seeing the keys , I played again . That was a great effect . A towel over the keyboard , and I played in spite of it , as a mark of extreme ability ! And for that extra concert I actually received some pay . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration , and a second concert in another district , Ostrog . This one in a tiny hall that held only some sixty or seventy people . But in both these concerts the towel test was repeated . I had become quite famous through it . My father could not go with me , but my tutor , Mr. Babianski , and my stepmother 's father accompanied me . These two old men were greatly moved and ( Continued on Page 55 ) ( Continued from Page 521 excited by these first public appearances . My programs were quite modest , as you can imagine , and not very long . I improvised a good deal , but I played a few pieces which I had taught myself , such as pieces by Kalkbrenner and Tedesco  --  a musician who was enjoying some reputation then  --  and last of all I played the Carnival of Venice . What was the effect on the people , you ask . Well , they liked it very much . Of course , they could not expect great things from a boy of twelve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not very high . I was already attracting the attention of certain people  --  some importan L. people . There was one very wealthy family  --  the family of Count Chodkiewicz  --  friends of my father 's , who insisted on taking me at this time to Kiev for a few weeks ' visit . You must realize that I had never heard any concerts at that age , nor any music , really . I had Bever heard an orchestra , a pianist , violinist , or even a singer . So this was a great adventure  --  my first . At Kiev , I heard my first concert They took me to the opera , too , and I even saw some very great artists performing dramas , and first among them all was Adelaide Ristori , an Italian . She was a very great actress , and I had a tremendous impression of her . She thrilled me . It was another kind of music to my ears Cheating the Wolf Pack On our way home from Kiev we were attacked by a great pack of wolves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late at night , in deep , deep snow , and bitterly cold . I was asleep in the bottom of the sleigh , wrapped in a great fur robe . There were still 120 miles to go by sleigh from where we were then . We had two sleighs , which was always the custom  --  a small one for the luggage and a big sleigh for the travelers . We had started late , and I fell asleep at once . Suddenly I was frightened and awakened by the shrill crying of wolves . The horses , I recall , were terribly frightened ; they were trembling all over . They scented the wolves first . The first thing I noticed when I awakened was several small lights  --  sharp , glowing little lights  --  shining in the night  --  the eyes of the wolves in the darkness . I did not know how far away they were . One of the men had a gun with him of course , but what was one gun against a pack of wolves ? The coachman of the first . sleigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That will frighten the wolves . We must , make a fire . There is nothing else to do , " he said . " We must burn the other sleigh . " So the luggage was quickly transported into the big sleigh and the other was set on fire at once . The fire caught very quickly , because the sleigh was filled with straw . It blazed up like a great torch , but , as we all realized , it . was only for a few moments . Luckily , at a distance of , perhaps , one or two hundred yards , there were enormous heaps of straw still in the fields , which had not been removed after the harvest . It was extremely fortunate for us  --  that straw saved our lives . The burning sleigh frightened the wolves , as fire always does , but it would last only is few minutes . a quarter of an hour , perhaps , and after that ? So we ran for the straw  --  all of us . I helped too . There were six or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savithat he shouted , " Thank God ! Thank God ! We are saved ! " The great fires were started . It took a long , long time  --  hours  --  to burn them all . The moment . we set . fire to that straw there was perfect quiet . We no longer heard the crying of the wolves or saw the shining little lights of their eyes in the darkness . Of course , in the morning many sleighs appeared and we went on with the journey home . We arrived late in the afternoon , and the first thing I saw were candles alight ? in the big living room . This did not surprise me , because I already knew that something was going to happen in my father 's house . I felt this the day before I left Kiev . I was very restless . I said to myself , " Something happens now in my home . There will be a great change when we return . " I could not sleep that night . I have always had a certain sensitiveness or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when I saw the candles burning , I knew that what I felt had happened . For there in the big room lay the body of my grandfather . He had died the day before . I have had several such experiences . I of ten had them as a child . Now I use more logic . Perhaps I am not so wise as I used to he , because now I apply logic to my intuition , and logic and intuition do not go hand in hand . About this time my father began to speak of sending me to Warsaw to the conservatory . He wanted me to have a real musical education . The interest of Count Chodkiewicz had made an impression , and I imagine my father had very serious thoughts about it , and , of course , there must have been a great . deal of discussion , because it . was an important thing in our little household to launch me forth in the conservatory . Fortunately for our plan , a railway was being built that connected our village with Warsaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could really take me there at last . And so I went at twelve years of age . We went on the first train that was organized . There were no cars for people ; only cars to transport merchandise . On that little train it was that we went to Warsaw  --  the real beginning of my musical life . At the conservatory . I was immediately and kindly received . The director was a very remarkable man . His name was Kontski . He was a remarkable violinist and the founder of that eonserratoire in Warsaw . When he spoke to me , he looked straight into my eyes ; he had such piercing eyes . I understood his look at once , and was not surprised . He said , " We 'll take this bay immediately , without any examination . " Yes , I withstood that look ; I faced him . We understood each other from the beginning . My father was so happy . He decided to look for a piano for me . But the pianos were all too expensive . Then somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The factory , shop and apartment were all on the same floor . They occupied a tremendous floor of some twenty or thirty rooms in a very old house . The owner , old Mr. Kerntopf , was a very sympathetic and lovable man . He said , " Yes , I have several pianos here , but I do n't know whether they will meet with your approval , because they are rather expensive . " He made a very low price , to which my father finally agreed . Suddenly , the eldest son . Edward Kerntopf , came in . He looked at me keenly and listened to my playing . My playing was very incorrect , but still there was something in it , some expression , for he said immediately to my father , " What do you want to do with the boy ? " My father replied quickly , " Oh , he has just been accepted for the conservemoire without even an examination . " He was very proud , you see , of the fart that I was not examined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for my boy . " " Nonsense , " said young Kerntopf . " You do n't want to buy a piano ; it would he worthless after a year . Why should you ? I will give him a piano for practice , and for nothing . " That was love at first sight , real friendship . From that moment began Edward Kerntopf 's interest for me . In that instant he befriended me as a small boy , and until the day of his death he never failed in his interest and devotion . He was my good Fate . My father was greatly touched by all this , and said , " I do not know quite where to put my boy . I would like to find a family to leave him with ; he is so young . You could , perhaps , give me some advice . " I stood by my father , listening to all this , and anxious ; I was still a little frightened . Again Edward Kerntopf came to the rescue , " Oh , let him live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are already ten children in the family . One more will make no difference , or you can pay a trifle to my mother , just for the food , if you wish , because we are not rich . " Well , that was charming . My father was , of course , very grateful for that . good arrangement . It took a great weight from his heart . The next morning he took me back to the Kerntopfs ' , and then he left me . Oh , that was pathetic , that moment when my father left me ! I cried . Then old Mrs. Kerntopf came to me . She was terribly fat , but she must have had a heart even larger than herself , and she immediately took me to her heart and tried to console me , She said I would not feel so much my father 's departure , because they would be very kind to me , and they loved me , and so on . I stayed with them until I finished my studies at the conservatory . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . They became my family . Our relations were very happy , with one exception  --  one of the boys . He was four years older than I , and from the beginning was trying always to show his superiority . He corrected me , for instance , on my Polish . He very often used slang , and I had been fed on poetry and the best literature , and I knew my language much better than he . But I came from the provinces , and he lived in the capital , Warsaw . So he simply had to show the country boy the superiority of the young city gentleman . So we quarreled very often , and sometimes violently . But finally everything adjusted itself , because he fell in love and , alas , could not express himself . So he begged me to write For Trim his first love letter ! There must he no slang in that  --  only poetry ! Then our quarrels ceased immediately and all was well . But . we digress . Let us return to the consereatoire . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them were very lively and amusing boys , and it had a great effect upon me , and I changed in a short time into quite a different creature . I became extremely mischievous . As I was so very quick in my movements and my hair was very red at that time , all my colleagues called me " squirrel . " We have only red squirrels in Poland . We know nothing about these gray squirrels in America . So " squirrel " was an appropriate name For me . Then , at the same time , I was rather afflicted with two little shortcomings . I could not pronounce a very well  --  there was a kind of whistling in my mouth ? and when I was playing the piano , I used to make dreadful grimaces at very difficult passages . The first thing  --  the had articulation  --  I practically got rid of . I studied that , not exactly like Demosthenes , by keeping small stones in my mouth , but I practiced with other means . I have always tried to overcome things from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies at the conservatory began at once with a disappointment  --  a hitter one . Although I was only twelve years old , and up to that time had had no real piano instruction , I already realized  --  or , perhaps , I should say , sensed  --  what kind of teacher I needed . I went to my first lesson at the conservatory with an eagerness that would he impossible for me to describe to you now . It had never occurred to me that I should again be defeated in my anxiety to learn how to play . My childish idea was that the conservatory would solve all my problems . But the first teacher I saw was so discouraging and so unpleasant that I asked at once to he relieved from piano study . He said that 1 had not the . sway with the idea that ever huge hands for piano playing . So I knew he Was not the one for me , and the quest still went on . On the other side , my teachers in theory were extremely enthusiastic from the start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not a pianist . The second piano teacher I went to was a very emotional man ; the first was simply a teacher , a pedagogue , and technique was the thing for him ; though he himself had not so very much technique . But the other was an artist , and he said that I had something to say with my fingers , and said , " Oh , you are talented . There is no doubt about that . " But his piano playing must have been , in his youth , very much like my own , because he did not pay the necessary attention to the technical difficulties . Such cruelty of fate ! I came across such teachers all the time . I made some little progress , of course , through hearing , not through playing myself , and I knew there were certain things which must he played correctly , but I could not play correctly myself , and my teacher did not give me the key to learn with . But in spite of this , I developed a certain repertoire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not perfectly , of course  --  very incorrectly  --  but st ill with certain accents that betrayed a natural tal en t . Then it occurred to the director of f he ronservaloirr that something must be done in order to attract public attention to the rorwrvalnirr . There were no orchestras outside the opera , no orchestral concerts in Warsaw ; only an orchestra from Berlin that came every summer . Well , the director of the omNcrrilloire felt that it was not right In let foreigners give those concerts , and he conceived the idea that there should be a Polish orchestra comprised .1f the ron  --  rrvainm. students . Now , while studying harmony and nterpoint , I was very much at-trailed by various instruments . I wanted to know them well . So , as it . was permitted to every pupil  --  also en-couraged  --  to join a class of brass in-struments , wood and wind instruments , I went . first to the teacher of the flute , and I started my career as a flutist . But there I met again with great discouragement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips were too thick for the flute . So , after a few weeks of hard study , when I had acquired a knowledge of the instrument , its actions and its limitations as well , I had to go away because the teacher insisted upon my leaving his class . Fate again ! So , not at all discouraged , I went to the oboe-and-clarinet class . There was a very nice teacher there , and lie liked me , personally , very much . He gave me the elements of oboe and clarinet playing , because he played both instruments himself extremely well . But he said that I had no future with the clarinet and oboe . I should take up something else . So I moved on again . To the bassoon next .. I studied the bassoon . I went from instrument to instrument . From the bassoon I went to the horn , and for a few months I really played the horn . Well , after having already tried to learn so many instruments , and after having got a real knowledge  --  at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was necessary to study all the others . So I went to the class of trumpets and of the trombone . Both instruments were under the same teacher , who immediately saw my remarkable talent for both the tnimpet and the trombone  --  especially the trombone . One day while giving the lessons  --  he was a very good man , kind , affectionate  --  he said , " Now , my dear boy , listen to me . You are always trying to play piano . Piano is useless for you ; your future is here , playing the trombone ! You are really remarkably gifted for it , and you will earn your livelihood with trombone , not with the piano . " He was terribly serious about this . " Yes . " he repeated , " your future is with the trombone . " Naturally , his words impressed me very much , and although I still held firmly to my faith in my piano playing , I accepted his verdict and worked very hard , and soon acquired some reputation with the trombone , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the symphonic orchestra in the conseruatoire matured , I was immediately appointed first trombone player of that orchestra . A great honor ! There were many rehearsals for that orchestra . I am telling this because it was a very dramatic incident in my life , which gave much concern and sorrow to my poor father . These rehearsals began toward the end of June , and the examinations were also taking place in the conservatoire in that month , and I had to pass my examination in counterpoint and some other subject which I had studied . So I was not so very comfortable in my appearances at the rehearsals , and several times I was sharply reproached by the director for not attending them . " But I can not ! " I said . " I have something much more important to do  --  my examinations . " " No , no , " he said , " there is nothing so important as these rehearsals , " because that was his hobby , you know . At that moment he was only interested in the orchestra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rehearsals . I was told that I should be detained  --  kept after school . I said , " No . I shall not be detained . It is impossible . " And I was right , because the principal thing was studying , not rehearsing for concerts . I refused to remain . So they used some violence ; they actually tried to keep me by force . Then I fought . We had a real encounter , a fight. , and even some students took my part . There was a serious riot , in the conservatory . The director then asked me whether I would at once submit myself to the discipline , or leave the conservaloire altogether . And I said , " I do not acknowledge that the conservatory has any right to arrest students for not attending the rehearsals , and I shall not accept that verdict , sir . I shall leave at once  --  please let the door be opened ! " And so , in great bitterness and excitement , I was expelled from the conservatory . Editor 's Note  --  This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Paderewski and Mary Lawton . The next will appear next week . pure poison . It would be inaccurate to say that hotels purposely neglect to cooperate with the police or that the management helps such unwelcome guests to make a getaway . But the hotel has no desire to obstruct their departure and if , in understandable hurry , they neglect to pay their bill , nobody is going to run after them . The protective machinery , however . is aimed solely at the one crooked or badly behaved patron and never touches the nine hundred and ninety-nine who are honestly paying their way and behaving themselves . When even dead beats and criminals are treated so considerately  --  because mistakes would take the high polish off that good will which is the hotel 's chief asset  --  it is understandable that the big modern hotel should expend incredible amounts of patience , energy and money on treating the legitimate customer well .
