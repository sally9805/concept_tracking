txt Europe 's first reactions to a blow aimed to upset the power balance not only on that Continent but in the entire eastern hemisphere indicate that a diplomatic defeat of the first magnitude has failed to break the resistance of the British , the French and the Poles . So far this is the one clear fact in the confusion and alarm produced by the latest and most startling of Hitler 's " surprises . " Until the non-aggression pact between Germany and Russia is signed and its Contents known , its real significance can not be estimated . The size of the staff Herr von Ribbentrop is taking to Moscow suggests that it is not yet drafted . The Russian communiqu ? implies that it is not negotiated . In any case it will contain clauses and concessions that must still be agreed on . Meantime all the European Powers increase rather than diminish their preparations for war . If the British have been tricked and humiliated , they have rallied bravely . The statement issued by the Government after yesterday 's Cabinet meeting declares in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would in no way affect British determination to fulfill to the letter the obligations assumed toward Poland . The language of this declaration is calm but unequivocal . His Majesty 's Government " remain of the opinion that there is nothing in the difficulties that have arisen between Germany and Poland which would justify the use of force involving a European war * * * but if in spite of all their efforts others insist on the use of force , they are prepared and determined to resist it to the utmost . " Parliament will meet on Thursday to pass the Emergency Powers Bill and reserves are being called up to bring the defense services to war strength . The French have taken a similar stand and similar precautions . More than half a million more men , it is reported , have been called to the colors . The Poles persist in their resolve to fight if an inch of their territory is invaded . Hitler has caused a sensation . He has shaken once more the unstable edifice of Europe , already weakened by previous blows . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantors to accept the " German solution , " the immediate results must be disappointing . It is too soon to forecast later developments . After all that has happened from last September up to yesterday , it is rash to assume that other undercover moves are not in progress . But the evidence at tht 's moment seems to prove that the basic elements of the situation are not decisively changed by the deal between Moscow and Berlin . The British guarantee to Poland was given before the negotiations with Moscow were begun . The tri-Power agreement had not been signed , and its effect has already been minimized by four months of haggling over details . During this protracted bargaining the Poles maintained their objection to opening their frontier to the Red Army , even as an ally , and this objection is now sustained by Russia 's refusal to fight the Germans . At the same time nothing in the record guarantees that the Russian tactics toward France and Britain may not be repeated in regard to Germany . If Hitler waits to move on Poland - until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immobilize him while negotiations are in process . The fact is , moreover , that among a dozen or more treaties of various kind concluded between the Soviet Unio : and the Reich since Rapallo , a pact o non-aggression was signed in Berli : April 24 , 1926 . Not only has thi ; treaty never been denounced ; it wa prolonged by a protocol in 1931 an ( ratified May 5 , 1933 , after Hitler cam to power . Thus if the resistance t ( German aggression remains unbroken if the pact so thunderously announce ( already exists , and contains the " es cape clause " written in similar treaties concluded by Russia with other Powers including Italy ; if Hitler 's pledge t ( Moscow is no better than his pledge a Munich , and Stalin 's distrust of Ger many equals his distrust of Britain ? then the chief impact of the coup the first impact and its greatest sig. nificance is in its timing and its psy chological effect . Even the overshadowing question of peace or war remains in the same sus. pense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomatic tri . umph , purchased at the price of his supreme sacrifice of principle , does not insure him another victory without war .
