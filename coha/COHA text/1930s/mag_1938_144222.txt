Izaak Walton 's definitive work on 17th-Century fishing , The Compleat Angler , is now a literary curiosity rather than a manual . A treatise published this week borrowed from its title but not its style . The Compleat Goggler* introduced a new sport , told the best ways of indulging it . <P> Guy Gilpatric , author of The Compleat Goggler and inventor of the sport , was a professional aviator who climbed to a passenger altitude record after three months as a licensed pilot , an advertiser who climbed to a vice-presidency after 13 years with Manhattan 's Federal Advertising Agency . Then he escaped to the French Riviera to write popular stories about a Scottish engineer . His spare time he passed in fencing and pistol shooting until he found scaly targets more interesting . <P> A goggle fisherman , wearing watertight glasses , a bathing suit and earplugs , dives down into an underwater paradise which is , as Author Gilpatric describes it , half marine science laboratory , half Freudian dream . There , armed with a spear , he harpoons a mullet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which is so suspicious of man underwater as of man out . Besides being better exercise than most fishing , goggle fishing has one further sporting advantage : It exposes the fisherman to some risk of being the victim as well as victor in the game . On one occasion , when a large octopus wrapped itself around Fisherman Gilpatric , he had a few bad moments cutting himself loose . <P> *Dodd , Mead ( $3 ) .
