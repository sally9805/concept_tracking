With the approach of the general elections , South African hoardings have recently been decked with posters depicting a white woman , a native husband and colored children . The antiSemitic , anti-native , anti-British , pro-Nazi Nationalist Party had designed the poster as a " horrible example " of what would happen if Prime Minister J. B. M. Hertzog 's and Deputy Prime Minister Jan Smuts 's United Party Government were continued in office . Left unmentioned was the fact that custom prevents miscegenation in the Union of South Africa and between 1932 and 1936 records show that not one white woman had married a native in the Union . <P> Enfranchised Afrikander women regarded the poster as besmirching their honor , attended protest meetings throughout the country against this type of campaigning . More to their liking were the less graphic appeals of Prime Minister Hertzog , Deputy Prime Minister Smuts and henchmen , who declared vaguely for " national and racial unity , " asked for support in the name of the " children 's future . " That South Africa prefers a non-illustrated campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Party rollicked over not only the Nationalists but also over the Anglophile Dominionites and the radical Laborites . The standing in the new House of Assembly will be : United Party , 111 ; Nationalist , 27 ; Dominion , 8 ; Labor , 3 ; Socialist , 1 .
