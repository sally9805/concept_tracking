txt A non-political board to enforce co-operation between Canada 's two railways  --  Canadian Pacific and Canadian National  --  is the keystone in the National Conservative Party 's program for dealing with the railway situation outlined here yesterday by its national leader . Dr. R. J. Manion . Other Proposals Dr. Manion declared the railways are " apparently unwilling to co-operate voluntaiily . " Co-operation , he submitted , is not a failure ? because it has never really been tried , despite the fact the 1933 railway bill provided for it . In addition to the non-political board which it would set up , Dr. Manion said , the Conservative Party proposes : compensation for jobs lost through co. - operation ; a fair rate basis for all forms of transportation , by Dominion-Provincial co-operation ; refunding of Canadian National Railway 's securities at lower interest rates ; no more playing politics with the railways , and building Canada up to the railways , instead of tearing the railways down . The Conservative leader again declared against unification . Such a move would not result in a combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to both railways , although its proponents once claimed $75,000,000 a year would be saved , he said . Party Program " Our program , " he added , " will keep both companies in existence ; do much to wipe out the deficit of the Canadian National and keep the Canadian Pacific from the danger of being unable to earn its fixed charges . " Under this program we can bring about anywhere from 75 to 90 per cent of the economies that could he brought about under unification , without doing Injustice to the employees of the railways ; without building up a great monopoly ; without setting up a huge political machine that might control governments ; and without making the Dominion of Canada ultimately responsible for all the liabilities of the private company .
