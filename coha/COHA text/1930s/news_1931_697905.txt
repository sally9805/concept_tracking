txt The United States Government tonight started a movement for giving publicity to figures of the armaments of nations by furnishing to the press the full text of a report made by Secretary Stimson to the League of Nations as a preliminary to the world disarmament conference which the League has called for next February . The action is seen as a first step in a program designed to bring about actual accomplishment in disarmament .. It is especially important in view of the indications that , if there is a substantial reduction in armament as the result of the world conference , the - United States will be inclined to show a sympatneiic feeling toward till desire of some European nations for a revision of their debt-funding arrangements with this country . The report to the League , designated as a " note , " is a document of thirty-six typewritten pages . It is comprised for the most part of tables showing land , naval and air armaments of the United States . The tables were prepared in response to a request from J. A. Avenol , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this and other governments furnish to the League particulars with regard to the " position of their armaments and all data , technical or otherwise , which might help to inform the ( disarmament ) conference and to justify such concrete proposals as the governments may lay before it . " Question of Publicity Stressed . The State Department , in complying with this request , has gone a step further . Nothing was said in the call for this data about waking it public , but Secretary Stimson , in his response to the League , asks that " full and immediate distribution and publicity be given to the American figures . " Mr. Stimson gave out the figures for publication simultaneously with their publication at Geneva . The purpose of this course was to open up information as to armaments prior to the assembling of the world disarmament conference . Dove-tailing with Mr. Stimson 's action is the desire to put pressure on foreign nations in the interest of curtailing big armies and navies . The Secretary took significant action in giving figures of the total army reserves of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the League . - While officials of the government will not make any such admission , the publicity given by the United States to its army reserves strength was a response to France and those nations which lined up with her in the work of preparation for the disarmament conference . The United States regards reserves as a main element in European armies . In the several sessions of the Preparatory Commission for Disarmament , which laid the groundwork for the conference , France , with the support of some other countries , made a determined fight to prevent the adoption of any provision for the limitation of reserves . France is credited with having been responsible for the failure of the Preparatory Commission to call on all governments for a statement of their total reserve strength . - All that was called for in connection with reserves was a statement of the daily average number of military effectives . In giving the total number of American army reserves , the United States appears to be engaged in an effort to get the reserve problem out into the open . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary General of the League of Nations reads : " During the fiscal year 1930 , 22 , - 393 reserves officers were called into the Federal service and trained for an average of 171 : : days per officer . This training , when computed under Article 3 of the Draft Convention , amounts to 1,075 average daily effectives . " The United States is the second nation which has responded to the request of the League for figures as to its military forces . Russia was the first to respond , but the understanding in official circles here is that its figures have not been made public . Secretary Stimson expresses the desire to have other nations give publicity to their armament figures as soon as possible and suggests that the Secretary General of the League call the attention of other governments to the attitude of the United States . " While the Secretary of State has noted the resolution of the ( League of Nations ) Council , adopted on May 23 , relative to the submission and distribution of figures , and transmits detailed information in accordance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor to request that full and immediate distribution and publicity be given to the American figures . The Secretary of State entertains the hope that other nations may thus be encouraged to lay their figures before the public without delay . The Secretary General may find it convenient to bring this communication to the attention of other interested governments . " Link with Debts Issue Seen . Thus the United States has taken a step which is regarded by many observers as a preliminary to an effort , not only to bring about material reductions in armies , but also to obtain developments on the allied debts to this country and other matters . The figures embodied in Mr. Stimson 's report contained nothing new as far as the land , naval and air armaments of the United States are concerned . The note to the League of Nations is dated June 5 .

Morrow of New Jersey , who was one of the American delegates at the London Naval Conference of last year ; Hugh S. Gibson , Ambassador to Belgium , who represented the United States in all the meetings of the Preparatory Commission for Disarmament , and officials of the State Department . Ambassador Gibson will sail for Europe Friday . and Secretary Stimson will depart for Europe later in the month , The Assembly of the League of Nations in September presumably will take further steps in preparation for the disarmament conference . At that time it probably will be decided whether the conference will be held next February , as scheduled , or be postponed , say , until June . With the date determined , the Unitel States Government will begin definite preparations for its participation . J. Thedore Marriner , now counselor of the American Embass ? , at Paris , who has had much experience in connection with the diplomatic aspects of the disarmament problem , will come here for consultation , and also probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the Preparatory Commission for Disarmament .

In the sessions of the Preparatory Commission for Disarmament the American delegation objected to a nroposal to limit budgetary expendiColCS for military purposes .
