Late one afternoon last week a sleek grey taxicab purred up to the Army Building in downtown Manhattan and out of it stepped a youth named Fiore Rizzo . Out also stepped three other young men . The taxi meter registered 65 . The four passengers had only 50 between them . <P> An Army captain obligingly paid the other 15 . Fiore Rizzo marched into the Army Building and announced that he was ready to go to work in the woods . He was , he said , 19 , single , one of a family of 13 and had been unemployed for a year . His father had not had work in three years . An Army doctor listened to Fiore 's heart , thumped his chest , looked down his throat , passed him as physically fit . Fiore Rizzo signed a blank authorizing the Government to pay $25 of his $30 monthly wage to his family , swore a 250-word oath which he did not fully understand and was shipped off to an Army post near New Rochelle as the first recruit in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Fiore Rizzo and 24,999 more citizens like him last week was President Roosevelt 's first direct attack upon ranks of 13,000,000 unemployed . By authority of last fortnight 's relief act , he issued an order creating the C. C. C. and providing it with $10,000,000 as a starter . Appointed Director of Emergency Conservation Work ( salary : $10,200 ) was Robert Fechner , 57. of Massachusetts , a vice president of the International Association of Machinists . The selection of this tall , austere Laborite was a sop to the A. F. of L. and its opposition to $1-per-day relief work . <P> President Roosevelt apportioned the first C. C. C. recruits as follows : <P> New York . . . . 7,500 St. Louis 900 <P> Buffalo 600 Kansas City . . 400 <P> Chicago 4,000 Baltimore ... 1,000 <P> Philadelphia . .3,000 Boston 900 <P> Pittsburgh ... 900 Milwaukee . . . 600 <P> Detroit 2,200 Washington .. . 500 <P> Cleveland . . . .1,000 Minneapolis . . 500 Cincinnati ... 500 Newark 500 <P> Enlistments were limited to single men between 18 and 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were all required to make a substantial allotment from their pay to their depend ents .

When sufficiently toughened , units of 20 to 100 were to be shipped to National Forests where they will plant trees , clear brush , work roads , build fire controls and fight insect pests . The U. S. Forest Service has 1,000,000 man-months of work waiting to be done by the C. C. C. when recruited to full strength ( 250,000 ) . Explained Director Fechner : <P> " Most of the men called will be off the bread line . The work will not be intensely laborious-but it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive a substantial number of workers because it is already warm there . There will be no military features in connection with the camps . "
