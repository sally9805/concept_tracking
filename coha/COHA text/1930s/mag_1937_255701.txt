While open-mouthed crowds still jammed the corridors of the surrealist exhibition at the Pennsylvania Museum of Art last week ( TIME , Feb. 8 ) , another imposing exhibition of paintings that seemed equally cockeyed to the vulgar mind opened several blocks away at the Philadelphia Art Alliance . The Solomon R. Guggenheim Collection , described by the Alliance 's President Yarnall Abbott as " the most complete collection of nonobjective painting in the world , " went up on the walls for a three-week showing . What the public had to see were 138 fairly large canvases and water colors by twelve artists in which there appeared , in brilliant color , circles , triangles , prisms , ruled lines , odd squiggles and amorphous blobs of paint . There were in addition 60 paintings by near abstractionists such as Modigliani , Picasso , Marc Chagall and the Impressionist Seurat , in which could be discovered such recognizable objects as cats , boats , bowls of fruit , doorways and French peasant women . <P> True abstractionists have for the fur teacups , disembodied heads and limp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Academy of Design . The basis of their philosophy is that a picture should not attempt to represent anything or suggest anything , should be an exercise in pure form , sufficient unto itself . In the introduction to the elaborate catalog of last week 's show the Baroness Hilla Rebay von Ehrenwiesen , moderately well-known as an abstractionist in her own right , wrote : <P> " Surrealism came in only recently , through such painters who invented this senseless title to stupefy the public . . . . In love with intellect and sensation , which has nothing to do with art , they stirred the public with ridiculous ideas , but did not produce any valuable revelations . ... No wonder the public distrusts the confusion brought about by all this in artistic ' kitch. ' " * <P> Other thoughts of the Baroness : <P> " . . . Non-objectivity will be the religion of the future . Very soon the nations on earth will turn to it in thought and feeling and develop such intuitive powers which lead them to harmony . " Owner of most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthday last week .

Born in Alsace , the daughter of a German general , the Baroness has studied painting all her life , was won to non-objectivity in 1914 , some time after the Battle of the Marne . After working with other abstractionists in Switzerland , the Baroness came to the U. S. in 1926 .
