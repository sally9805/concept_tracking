txt Mr. was 70 years old on Stays Jan. 6 . In the ordiOn. nary , course of events , that would have meant his retirement , under the age limit , from the post which he has held for so many years that Controllers have come to regard him as a fixture  --  chief accountant of the Department of Finance . But the Board of Estimate would n't hear of it , and voted yesterday to keep him in office for two more years . That was a wise move , for the city would be lost without MACINNES . There are perhaps a dozen men living who have explored the mysteries of city finance , but he alone has penetrated to its innermost recesses . He dwells amid the sinking funds , land the debt limit is his crony . Controllers could hardly get along without him . There never was a time when his services were more needed than right now . Perhaps some day budgets will be more intelligible and the intricacies of the city 's accounting easier to follow . Until then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has already reduced some of the annual statements issued by the department to a level not so far above ordinary human understanding as to be absolutely hopeless . A $10,000,000 check is nothing in his life . They say that in his moments of leisure he plays the bagpipe very persuasively . Sheriff FARLEY Is Indicating going to reply to the the various charges made Difference . by Judge SEABURY . Some idea of the psychological , metaphysical and even recreational aspects of the problem which this answer may give Governor ROOSEVELT may be gained from this excerpt from an interview which The World-Telegram had with the High Sheriff : " Suppose you and another fellow had bet on a fight and given me the money ? $1,000 , say  --  to keep as stakeholder , And suppose a year passed before the bet ivact decided , I 'd gin the winner the $1,000 , but I 'd keep the $60 interest . ? ? ? If I put it in a bank and the bank went out of business , I 'd have to make good . ? ? ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank , then you 'd get the interest . But you 'd have to stand the loss if the bank went under . See the dif-ference ? " It is undoubtedly a pretty question in law and ethics . Mr. FARLEY told the newspaper that he is still holding the interest moneys on taxes until the courts decide to whom it belongs . But this money is being kept " in the office , " so that the fate of no bank will affect it . This must be comforting to a man who has already suffered much . People interested Vanishing in clothes reform Hats should approve the for Spring . new hats to be worn by ladies next Spring . If the style comes and goes as quickly as the late Eugenie fashion , the milliners also should be pleased . Probably no out-of-date article of clothing makes a woman feel so completely out of the picture as a last year 's hat . Even the most unobservant man knows there is something wrong when he sees a girl today with one of those left-over empress confections perched over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tilted down over any portion of the face . They are to be so small that believers in the hatless head for health 's sake will probably consider them a fair compromise . Posed at an angle on the right side , they will be held on by a miracle , as well as a mere man can judge , and will expose most of the hair . No doubt the first ones to make their appearance on the street will look strange , but it is amazing how quickly they take on the air of a permanent fashion . As soon as we get used to seeing them , tiny , almost invisible from the front , trimmed with tall quills shooting up the back , all other hats for women will look as absurd as the styles to be found in an old photograph album . Probably few Prize-Winning youngsters cast a ing about for a Profession . life work ever consider the possibility of making a ' living by winning prizes . Yet there are in this country several people who receive a competence in prize money in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Printer 's Ink calls them . They are ardent followers of contests ? solving cross-word puzzles and rebuses , writing slogans or essays , &c.; ? that are sponsored by advertisers on the air , in newspapers and magazines . The editor of the Contest Magazine takes issue with Printer 's Ink on the use of the term " professional contestant . " He maintains that even consistent prize-winners go in for contests as a hobby , not as a means of livelihood . He cites the cases of an Indiana stenographer who has won some $25 , - 000 in the last few years ; a sales executive who " clicks off a prize on an average of every ten days , " and a housewife who averages around $2,000 a year . All of these he would grant amateur standing . It is a problem as delicate as determining when an amateur tennis player becomes a professional sport : writer . If a person seizes pencil and paper at the mere mention of prize : to be won , he is doubtless a genuine " contest fan " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when hit profits roll in by the thousands , hi : activities begin to take on a commercial color .
