Of no significance was the annual revival of the oyster business , starting last week . But of great significance was a 6,000-ton steamer , slowly going down the Atlantic seaboard . She was the Frango , first ship of the new American Whaling Co . Aboard her are 69 oldtime Norwegian whalers . In charge of the expedition is Captain Olaf Stokken of Sunnyfield , N. J. ; in charge of the vessel is Captain Johannes Smith of Freeport , L. I. Off Georgia the Frango will be joined by four small " killer " boats , will then proceed to the Antarctic . Unfamiliar in this region is the U. S. flag , for the large-scale Antarctic whaling industry is conducted by English , Norwegian and Danish vessels , many of which are controlled by Anglo-Norwegian Holdings , Ltd. , whose shares are traded in on the New York Curb . If the Frango does well , American Whaling Co. will add other vessels , attempt to regain U. S. whaling prestige . <P> Meanwhile whales figured in news despatches from both coasts . In Shelton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 2 a. m . Mill hands hooked a hawser around its jaw , towed it to deep water . Thereupon it rushed to another part of the bay , was eventually harpooned . In Dover , N. H. , a whale became marooned on a mud-flat , was shot by local police . Editorially , the New York World denounced this act , pointed out that while a live whale is no asset to a community , a dead one is a distinct liability .
