" Mrs. Potocki told how she was taken from her apartment in a police van to Greenwich Street Station , where she was booked and then taken to a cell in Old Slip Station . She said she cried in agony all night but that the matron on duty , Mrs. Catherine Begley , would not get her a doctor . Next morning , she said , her employer in the restaurant , Harry Meyer of 98 Riverside Drive , sent her an attorney . Held on Dry Law Charge Too . The lawyer was James F. Sullivan . Mrs. Potocki agreed to pay the bail bond premium on her $500 bail in the magistrate 's court as well as that of Mrs. Barry , who was charged with the same offense . After being arraigned before Magistrate Jesse Silberman in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of not guilty she was taken . to Federal court , where a prohibition law violation was booked against her and in which she was held in bail of $1,000 .

She went to the Seamen 's Bank for Savings and drew out the entire account of $1,901 . She gave Sullivan $1.000 and kept the remainder . Mrs. Potocki had been a member of the St. Monica 's Guild of the Trinity Church Mission in 211 Fulton Street , going to the guild meetings every Thursday afternoon . On Sept. 25 , the day after she had returned from Woman 's Court , a social service worker attached to the mission , Miss Ethel N. Rainsford , who lives at the mission house , called on her . On seeing her physical condition Miss Rainsford insisted that Mrs. Potocki go to a hospital , the witness said , so on ' the next day , Sept. 25 , she went . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by Dr. Louis Goldblatt . Meanwhile she saw her friends of the never-fulfilled theatre party , Schwartz , Gordon and Mrs. Haber , and told them about having given Sullivan , the attorney , $1,000 , showing them the receipt she had obtained from Sullivan . Gordon went to see Sullivan , and was told , , he testified , that the fee for defense would be $100 and that the $1,000 was only for " security . " Mrs. Potocki called on the Rev. William B. Kinkaid , also of the Trinity Church , and told him her story . The clergyman interviewed the lawyer , became suspicious , and asked Colonel George W. Burleigh , one of the church members and an attorney with offices in 44 Wall Street , to take a hand in the case , which Colonel Burleigh did . Eventually both women were brought to trial before Magistrate Earl A. Smith in Women 's Court . Colonel Burleigh , a member of his office , Morris Perman , and Sullivan were the attorneys for the defense . The trial lasted two days . Magistrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimony of the witnesses " so shocked " him that he discharged the defendants and ordered a copy of the minutes sent to Chief Magistrate Corrigan . Magistrate Corrigan turned the case over to Referee Seabury . Colonel Burleigh Takes the Stand . Colonel Burleigh took the stand and told how , after much trouble , he had finally induced Sullivan to come to his office . Sullivan , he said , insisted on being paid $300 as a fee . $20 for a service which Mrs. Potocki described as being that of escorting her 10-year-old child home from Children 's Court where she had been sent bypolice and $110 for bonds , a total of $430 . The rest of the $1,000 was turned back to Mrs. Potocki . Mrs. Barry took the stand and told her story , similar in every respect to that of Mrs. Potocki . Harry Meyer told from the witness stand how Sullivan had promised to defend Mrs. Potocki for $100 . Meyer said he arranged for Joseph A. Rice , a bondsman , to bail out the two women and had promised to indemnify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rice , Meyer said , and the money was given back to him by Sullivan . Meyer said he was surprised by what Sullivan had done . He said , also , that Sullivan had skipped , leaving $60 in worthless checks in his , Meyer 's , possession . The Rev. Mr. Kinkaid told of an interview with Sullivan and how he had become suspicious after Sullivan evaded an indirect question about the $1.000 . Rice testified that he knew nothing whatever about the $1,000 " security " held by the attorney . Doctor Describes Her Injuries . Dr. Goldblatt described the injuries he had lotted down on a card at the time of his examination of Mrs. Potocki . The card was placed in evidence . Dr. Goldblatt said that in his opinion the physical evidence was sufficient to support Mrs. Potocki 's statement of attempted assault . Mrs. Potocki had said that the pain in her left side had never disappeared . The liquor selling charge was dismissed by the Federal authorities when they learned , from the Women 's Court records , of the scene in Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as did Schwartz , who said he was a dressmaker , and Gordon , who said he was a furrier at 120 West Forty-fifth Street . Gordon said he had known Potocki in Poland . These witnesses , and Meyer , testified that they had never known anything about Mrs. Potocki to her discredit .. They descriieed her as a hard-working and earnest mother , so did the Rev. Mr. Kinkaid , who had known the family nine years , he said , and so did a Miss Alice B. Reynolds , a stenographer , whose Brooklyn address was not revealed . Sister Florence Hilda , an Episcopal nun , living and teaching in the Trinity Mission , told of numerous visits to the Potocki home , as did Miss Rainsford . James J. Comiskey , a business man , of 128 Cedar Street , also testified to her good industry and care of her children . Harry Lewis , the taximan , told of his long friendship with Potocki , and said stood at a cab stand in front of the home all day . 1 , Mrs. Begley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty whom Mrs. Potocki and Mrs. Barry described as having refused to call a doctor in Old Slip Station on the night of the arrest , testified that she had examined Mrs. Potocki on that night and found no marks of violence . Mrs. Anna Brennan , another matron who relieved Mrs. Begley at midnight , testified similarly . Patrolman Lewis Testifies . Then Lewis , the arresting officer , took the stand . He gave his address as 2,031 East Thirty-Seventh Street , Brooklyn . Lewis was admonished many times by Referee Seabury to keep his voice up . In describing what had gone on in the apartment he found himself , on several occasions , directly contradicting the testimany he had given at the trial before Magistrate Smith . Then he had said tlfat Mrs. Potocki tried to throw herself out of a window and had been bruised when he restrained her . Yesterday he told how she had thrown " lamps , books and other things " at the policemen after being told she was under arrest . He said he had used " necessary force " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had broken a five-pound lamp over 's head but he did n't know why an assault charge . a felony , had not been made against the women . Before Magistrate Smith he had testified that he had not taken a drink in the apartment . Yesterday he said that after the first three he began pouring his on the floor , but that he had drank the three . He will resume the stand for further questioning this morning . A county grand jury began delving yesterday into the story told by Harry Levey , former stool-pigeon , of how he had collected $7,500 monthly from proprietors of speakeasies which he turned over to vice squad Patrolmen William M. O'Connor and James J. Quinlivan , by whom he said he was employed . Some twenty witnesses , most of them the speakeasy operators , were present under subpoena , but only four were taken before the grand jury and the rest were told to return today . Levey had already been before the grand jury .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
