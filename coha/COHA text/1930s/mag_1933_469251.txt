" I AM not ashamed of going into bankruptcy , " one of our wellknown actresses announced to the press the other day . " After all , the best people are doing it . Sign of the times and all that sort of thing , you know . " She was in debt for a mere $7,436 , and she thought it was " simply nasty " of her creditors to press her . Out in Michigan Governor Comstock , reputed to have been wealthy in other days , is fighting garnishment proceedings which have grown out of a $7,802 property judgment against him in the matter of a lease . " It is n't any secret that I 'm broke , " the Governor says . " Two years ago I should have worried if I owed a man a cent , but to-day it is different . " Debt repudiation is in the air . France defaults on her war debts , England insists upon a new deal , and our farmers , faced with ruin , demand that they be forgiven their debts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on inflated valuations , are also in trouble . Foreclosures and forced sales yield so little that deficiency judgments for staggering amounts are taken against debtors who have no choice but to go into bankruptcy . In the retail field , druggists and grocers are being driven into bankruptcy by the ruinous competition from the chain stores that have sprung up everywhere . Still other people who leased their apartments in the boom days at a figure incommensurate with their present incomes find that the only way to wipe out their accumulated rent is to go through bankruptcy . In practically all such cases the sympathy of the public is with the debtor . The mortgage holder who forecloses or the creditor who secures a judgment against a man , is a heartless Shylock and his victim an honest Bassanio . President Hoover , the archpriest of individualism , urged upon Congress before he left office , a change in the bankruptcy law designed to facilitate the payment of debts by " composition , " an arrangement under which the debtor reaches an agreement with the majority of the creditors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without going through formal bankruptcy . In his message to Congress he urged relief for " individual and corporate debtors who through no fault of their own are unable in the present emergency to provide for the payment of their debts . . . . " It is clear that a certain amount of liquidation among business concerns is essential to economic recovery . It is equally clear that many individuals who to-day are repudiating their debts are helpless victims of the depression , only a little more unfortunate than the rest of us . But what is to be said of people who come out of bankruptcy " TAKING richer than they went in ? Of people who appear to be far from destitute and yet who seize upon bankruptcy as a convenient way to write off their doctors ' bills , their department store purchases , their bills for household furniture , furs , expensive gowns , and all other debts which they may have incurred for the luxuries as well as the necessities of life ? Are these people to be labelled as crooks , or have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ? The practice of wiping out debts is as old as the Bible . In the 15th chapter of Deuteronomy , Verses 1 and e , we read , " At the end of every seven years , thou shalt make a release . And this is the manner of the release : Every creditor that lendeth aught unto his neighbor shall release it ; he shall not exact it of his neighbor , or of his brother ; because it is called the Lord 's release . " The first English law , enacted in the time of Henry VIII , was not so humane . Not only were a debtor 's goods taken away from him to satisfy the claims of his creditors , but he was thrown into prison . This practice continued in England well into the Nineteenth Century , as readers of Charles Dickens know . Our forefathers , who had fled from England to escape oppressive laws of all kinds , set it down in the Constitution that " Congress shall have power to establish uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1841 , and in 1867 the first law was enacted which made personal as well as business debts dischargeable through bankruptcy . But it was repealed in 1878 , and for the next twenty years we had no federal bankruptcy statute . Finally in 1898 a definitive act was passed . This Act , as amended In 1925 , provides that individuals and most categories of business concerns whose liabilities exceed their assets , may upon petition to the court be discharged of their obligations after they have surrendered to their creditors all of their property . Individuals are allowed such exemptions as the State law specifies . Most States allow a bankrupt and his family to keep so many dollars ' worth of furniture and clothing , also the " tools of his trade . " In agricultural States the homestead and a certain amount of livestock are also exempt . The Act is sweeping in its effect . A man may owe many thousands of dollars and not have a cent left to turn over to his creditors ; yet by " taking a bankruptcy bath " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes forth washed clean of his debts , with a few important exceptions . He will still be liable for back taxes , alimony payments , debts incurred through embezzlement or obtaining money under false pretenses , a judgment for breach of promise " when accompanied by seduction , " damages assessed for the wilful or malicious injury to the person or property of another individual , and wages to his employees for three months prior to his filing a petition . Debts such as these may be satisfied by judgments and garnishments regardless of bankruptcy . Nothing can stop a man from enjoying the benefits of bankruptcy provided he has not been discharged within the past six years and his creditors can show no legal reason why he should be denied his present discharge . To restrain him they must prove to the satisfaction of the court that he perpetrated a fraud upon them by issuing a false financial statement in order to secure further credit , or that he committed perjury , or concealed his assets , or was guilty of some other crime under the Bankruptcy Act . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cases since it is not worth the creditors ' while to search for it . The theory of the Act ? that a man who is overburdened by debt must be given a fresh start in life for the good of society as well as his own good ? is sound enough . But the question may fairly be raised whether the Act , as it is written and administered , does not encourage an irresponsible and in some cases an insolent attitude toward debt . II Glance , if you please , at the schedule filed by a certain New Yorker , who has always sold his services for a high price . He lives , or did when he filed his petition , at a fashionable address on Park Avenue , and he was working at the time for a firm of some importance . His income is not stated , but an overdue balance of $125 on his federal income tax for 1931 , and an additional tax of $284 for 1930 , go to show that he belongs to the higher-salaried class . He appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items which he ordered while he was in London in 1931 were hollow shoe-trees at $10 , Russian brogue laced shoes at $36 , and polo boots at $66 . The $1,200 worth of debts which he left behind him in England apparently did not keep him awake at night ; for in the spring of 1932 he redecorated his Park Avenue apartment on a scale suitable to a man with a very comfortable income . There were $1,100 worth of velvet carpets , sofas , chaise longues , and other merchandise purchased from a Fifth Avenue firm , $195 worth of pottery bought from another store , and $166 worth of kitchen equipment from still another . Five months later , in October 1932 , he suddenly found himself penniless ? remember that he had a position ? and so he filed a petition in bankruptcy , listing $4,530 in liabilities and no assets , except for$225 which he claimed was due him for services rendered and on a car he had turned in . Besides his income tax , the bills he had run up in England , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ice company , the dentist , the cigar dealer , and a lawyer to whom he had given notes . Bankruptcy is supposed by the uninitiated to be an ordeal and a disgrace . It was nothing of the kind for this smart New Yorker . He was summoned once to the office of the Referee in Bankruptcy for a first meeting with the creditors , and at that time merely had to swear that his schedule contained " a full and true statement of his liabilities and assets . " He was not asked to appear again for an examination by counsel because there were practically no assets in his estate , and the creditors were unwilling to engage a lawyer and throw good money after bad . So he got off without having to answer such questions as " What salary were you earning at the time you filed your petition ? " " What did you do with the balance in your checking account ? " " When did you tell your wife that this expensive furniture belonged to her ? " " Have you a safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks and bonds ? " " When and how did you dispose of them ? " An examination of this kind , made by an astute lawyer , might conceivably have uncovered some hidden assets . But not necessarily , since a wife may hold under her own name property which her husband has given her as a mark of " love and affection , " and her husband 's creditors will not be able to touch it , unless they can show that the transfer was made at a time when he was already insolvent or was contemplating a hazardous venture . This particular bankrupt will undoubtedly be discharged as soon as the trustee has collected the small amount of money due the estate and turned it over to the governmen t for the income tax arrears . The creditors will not get a cent . In the meantime the bankrupt continues to live well and to earn a good salary . The hero of our story may be inclined to boast ? in the circles in which he moves ? of the way in which he has got rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affair quiet , he can easily do so in a city as large as New York . Two of the New York newspapers , the Times and the Herald-Trib une , publish lists of bankruptcies daily , under the caption , " Business Troubles , " but this information is buried in the financial section where the casual reader never comes upon it . This New York case is typical of the thousands of " no asset " bankruptcie s which go through our courts . The bankrupt reports that he has nothing , the creditors are afraid of losing more money in an investigatio n , and so the case slides through the courts . Bankruptcy is a judicial process , and yet curiously enough no one sits in judgment on the bankrupt . The Referee , who is appointed by the United States District Court to pass on bankruptcy petitions , is just what his title implies , a referee between two sides . He has no discretion , and if the creditors raise no objections , he is obliged under the law to recommen d to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No-asset " cases are like the undefended divorce suits , in that they leave the door wide open to fraud . But there is this important difference . In divorce cases the burden of proof is upon the petitioner to show why he should be freed . In voluntary bankruptcy cases the petitioner has to prove nothing : he only has to swear to a statement as to his liabilities and assets , and the burden of proof is upon the creditors to show why he should not be discharged of his debts . The lengths to which the Act goes in placing the responsibility y on the creditor are illustrated by a recent Supreme Court decision . A petitioner had been denied a discharge upon a showing by the creditors that he had made a false financial statement . Several months later he had filed a second application for a discharge , and the creditors neglected to file their objections again . He was , therefore , discharged . Subsequently it came out that he had gone through bankruptcy less than six years previously , and the creditors sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was illegal . But the Supreme Court ruled that it was valid since the creditors had raised no objections at the time . It should be added that the trustee , who is appointed by the creditors to administer and liquidate what there is left of the debtor 's property , is supposed to make a search for hidden assets . But here again , if there is no money , or very little left in the estate , the trustee and his counsel are at a serious disadvantag e in carrying on the search . It frequently happens , furthermore , in the " no-asset " cases , that there is not even enough money in the estate to defray the expenses of calling a meeting of the creditors for the purpose of electing a trustee . III Professors in the law schools will tell you that the Bankrupt cy Act was designed to relieve debtors who are being constantly harassed and sued by their creditors and who have no resources with which to meet their obligation s . No law could have a more beneficent purpose . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind who earns enormous sums of money and spends still larger sums . Consider this fantastic story . A popular dancer who appears both in the movies and on the legitimate stage went into bankruptcy , owing more than $200,000 . She had bought one automobile after another , paying 20 per cent down and forgetting the balance . Jewels , furs , clothes , flowers , she had had to have in abundance . Yet the only assets she listed were some old furniture in a warehouse and a $5,000 equity in a suburban house that was mortgaged for $25,000 . When the creditors ' lawyer wanted to know what she had done with the jewels which the tabloids had described as hers , she said she had pawned them , on such and such a date , for $5,000 . But she could not produce the ticket . Strange , the lawyer remarked , that she should have had to raise this money the same week that she was paid $15,000 by a motion picture producer . She shrugged her shoulders and said she really could n't remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bankrupts , she had never kept books ? could n't be bothered . Replying to one of the creditors who had asked how much she was now earning in vaudeville and the movies , she impudently turned on him and said , " What 's that to you ? " She was within her legal rights ; for the law holds that the creditors have no claim upon property or money acquired at any time after the filing of the petition . If this dancer succeeds in getting her discharge she will be free to begin her career of spending all over again . There are always merchants who are foolish enough to extend credit to people who have big names no matter how bad their reputation . It is very convenient to have an agent . Several years ago one of our famous opera singers was met at the boat by her agent and told to sign a petition in bankruptcy which he had prepared . It seemed that she was in debt for $45,788 , $2,621 of which sheowed for income taxes . There was a $20,000 persona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest was owed to gown and specialty shops . According to her schedule , the prima donna had no assets other than one small insurance policy and such furniture and clothes as the law exempts . Yet she appeared at the Referee 's office , naively wearing a platinum , diamond-studded wrist watch . It had been a gift from a certain symphony orchestra , she told the attorney for the creditors , and she supposed it was of no value since it had her name engraved on it . She admitted too that she owned a mink fur coat and an ermine one . There appeared to be still more serious omissions in her schedule . Had she not received royalties from the talking machine company for which she had not accounted , and what of the life insurance policies on which dividends had recently been paid ? Her agent had either discreetly refrained from keeping books or had destroyed the records , and she insisted that she knew nothing about her own business affairs . In the end the Referee decided , over the objections of the creditors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was entitled to her discharge . About $900 was realized from the sale of her watch and furs , but this went to the government as a small part of what she owed on her income tax . The stores that had sold clothes to her and the financier who had loaned her $20,000 were left holding the bag , while she went on earning a good income under contracts with an opera company , a talking machine company , and a large concert bureau . The boldness of bankrupts these days makes those of us who have a conscience about paying our debts seem quite old-fashioned . An interior decorator with a studio in a fashionable street in New York took a profitable " bath " not long ago . Her petition showed that she owed $53,000 to furniture concerns , upholster ers , painters , etc . On the asset side she listed the furnishings of her shop as worth $2,500 , and a claim of $15,000 against her husband for unpaid alimony . But the gentlema n could not be located , and her claim against him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was worthles s to the creditors . When they went into her shop to look over the " $2,500 worth of furnishin gs " they found that the objets d'art and the antiques which had formerly adorned the quarters had all disappeared , and that what remained was not worth more than $100 . At the hearing one of the creditors asked her about a heavy string of pearls which he had seen her wearing not many months before . Her sister had lent it to her , she said , and that was all there was to that . Iv If the debtor has shrewd legal advice ? and there is plenty of it available ? he is almost certain to beat the game coming or going . A merchant , let us say , owes $50,000 and has $25,000 in cash . He owes $20,000 of the $50,000 to relatives who are not pressing him . Before he goes into bankrupt cy he pays them off , with the understan ding that they will let him have the money again to start a new business . When he files @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creditors engage lawyers and accountan ts to discover what has become of his working capital . In the course of time they find out about the payment to the relatives and they bring action to recover the money , since the Bankrupt cy Act provides that a creditor who receives a preferenti al payment within four months of the bankrupt cy , knowing that the debtor was insolvent and was planning to liquidate , may be forced to relinquish the money . But it is not easy to prove that the relatives or the friendly creditors who were preferred knew of the impendi ng bankrupt cy . The bankrupt , therefore , approach es the creditors and says , " You have a doubtful case against my relatives . If you lose it , the entire $5,000 that is left in the estate will be eaten up . If you are completel y successful you will recover after the administr ation expenses are taken out , at the outside $17,500 , or 35 cents on the dollar . My relatives are willing to settle with you now for $12,000 , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear admissio n that there has been fraud , but in nine cases out of ten the creditors will take the cash and let justice go , and the bankrupt will be discharge d under a " composition " agreement . The stigma of bankrupt cy does not prevent a man from going into business again . It is all done with mirrors . After he has put his new business in the name of a secretary or clerk , he borrows money or merchand ise from a relative ? assumi ng that he has not been able to conceal any assets ? a nd issues a financial statement showing the assets he has on hand . This will get him credit , and he will once again be launched on his career of piracy . A few years later he may go into bankruptcy all over again , filing his petition under his clerk 's name , in order to get around the six-year provision of the law . Stories of crooked bankrupt cies in the mercantil e and business world are not news . But it is news , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchant ? and his way of looking at debt ? are spreading into all levels of society . The other day a lawyer friend of mine received a call from a man of his acquainta nce who wanted to get rid of his debts before he took a good position . He owed florists ' bills , doctors ' bills , grocery bills ? all carried over from the boom period when he had lived up to the hilt of a very good income . By a process of ratiocination he had convinced himself that he no longer owed the full amount of these bills . " Why , " he said , " the flowers I bought would cost to-day $40 instead of $80 . And take this surgeon 's bill ? why should I have to pay him according to 1920 standards ? " My friend 's answer was that he had bought the flowers and had had the operation in 1929 , but his caller did not choose to see the logic of his reasoning . Doubtless he did not have to go far to find a lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days later the same friend had another man call on him who wanted to write off a sheaf of doctors ' and household bills which amounted to $500 or $600 . He was about to collect a commission on a sale , and he did not want to run the risk of having his bank account attached , because he was looking forward to buying a new car . His purchase will help the automobile industry , no doubt , but it is hard to see why the Italian green grocer , the dentist , the doctor , and the butcher should not have the privilege of spending a little of the money which he owes them . One of the most callous debt-repudiators I have heard of is a well-known New York doctor who went through bankruptcy to clear himself of a judgment in a negligence case . He had been driving rapidly , as doctors will , and had gravely injured a boy . To his dismay he found that his broker had allowed his liability insurance to lapse and that he was personally liable for the $9,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advised him that this was the kind of a negligence claim which could be written off by going through bankruptcy , since he had not been charged with " wilful or malicious intent to injure . " He was able to get his discharge without any difficulty , sincethe parents of the injured boy could not afford to fight the case . His reputation to-day is as good as it ever was , while the child he injured promises to be a burden on society . Still more conscienceless , I should say , is a real-estate operator who owes some $30,000 and is preparing to file a petition in bankruptcy before be inherits $250,000 from his mother , who has cancer and is expected to die in a few months . There is good legal precedent for what he is planning to do . The law books contain the case of a father who in his will directed the trust company to pay a spendthrift son the income from $50,000 during his lifetime , and to pay him the principal " when he should become financially solvent and able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the principal of the trust fund . " As soon as the will had been probated , the son ? who was deeply in debt ? filed a petition in bankruptcy and promptly received his discharge . He was then eligible to inherit the principal of the trust fund . It is immaterial whether the father was careless in drafting the will or whether he intended his son to go into bankruptcy . What matters is that the law allows people who have a certain expectancy of an inheritance , or a good income ? as the New Yorker , the opera singer , the dancer , and the well-known doctor all had ? to repudiate their just obligations . Buying when you know you can not pay for your purchases ? or when you have already decided to go into bankruptcy ? is almost the same thing as shoplifting . The only difference is that obtaining credit when you are insolvent is not a crime in this country even if the theft involved is on a much larger scale than in petty shoplifting . Not long ago the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife had run up within the space of six months ? in a dozen different stores ? bills totaling $2,000 . It appeared that he and his wife had had domestic difficulties , and that she had taken to spending as a diversion , opening charge accounts in a number of stores on the strength of her husband 's hospital connections . ( It is easy for any woman to open charge accounts in her own name if her husband occupies a responsible position , for the store very seldom asks his permission , knowing that the law makes him liable for his wife 's bills . ) When the young doctor discovered that his wife was buying clothes lavishly , he lost his head and started in doing the same thing . As the stores began to press him , he chose the easiest way out and went into bankruptcy . Nothing could have been simpler . His only assets consisted of his home and office furnishings and the clothes which he and his wife had bought . Their personal property , all told , was undoubtedly worth more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York ; but in such cases creditors very rarely attach used furniture and clothes because they know that they can not get enough for them to justify the trouble . So the young doctor " took his bath " without suffering any upset in his life , and it is doubtful whether his colleagues at the hospital know that he has gone through bankruptcy . The number of fur coats which one sees on the streets in New York would suggest that there is no depression . The truth is that a great many furs are being purchased on the installment plan , and some of them will never he paid for . Last August a stenographer earning $20 a week bought a leopard coat for $200 on the installment plan . She very soon fell behind in her payments , and when the store began to annoy her , a lawyer friend suggested that she go into bankruptcy . The process cost her about $50 ? that is the very least it can he done for in New York ? but she was still more than $100 to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was worn and of no use to them . " You see , " this stenographer said to her girl-friend , wrapping her coat about her , " how easy it is to get things if you know how ! " Another young woman who has worked as a private secretary with a large corporation for eleven years opened a charge account not long ago with a department store and gave as a reference the name of a reputable business man of her acquaintance . She proceeded to buy $180 worth of clothes , and filed a petition in bankruptcy the following month . Perhaps she too had read in the paper that " the best people are doing it . " She would probably lose her job if her employers knew what she had done ; but the large stores , I am told , do not make a practice of compromising customers with their employers unless it will profit them to do so . In this instance the customer went into bankruptcy before the store would have thought of garnisheeing her salary . A person who uses a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the summer of 1931 a woman whose husband was a New Jersey manufacturer opened an account with a Fifth Avenue specialty shop . For the first six months her purchases were small , and she paid her bills promptly . Then suddenly , after the first of the year , she bought about ten times as much as she had at any time previous , and two weeks later her husband went into bankruptcy . In another instance , a charge customer of long standing ? a man this time ? requested a certain department store to close his account in 1929 . In August , 1931 , he asked to have it reopened , made $150 worth of purchases on the same day , and the following day went into bankruptcy . Such cases , according to the New York Retail Credit Association , are not so rare as one might think . The merchants of the city have always taken losses on bankruptcies , but to-day the proportion of such accounts is one-third to one-half greater , and they realize very little if anything on the estates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was owed $450 collected a dividend of fifty-six cents . VI Defenders of the present Bankruptcy Act argue that merchants who allow themselves to be thus defrauded have only themselves to blame . It is true that they have been far too ready to extend credit . I am a journalist with an irregular income and yet I have had letters from a number of the large stores with which I have traded very little , inviting me to open a charge account . Doubtless they would not let me charge a $1,500 mink coat , but they probably would if I lived in a fashionable apartment hotel and had a country home . A woman who divides her time between New York , Paris , and Cannes recently went into bankruptcy for $693,000 , owing $23 , - 500 for rugs , $32,000 for furniture , $20.000 for a diamond bracelet and so on . Neither she nor her husband ever had any financial rating . and yet the Fifth Avenue merchants had practically run after her to get her trade . It is almost an unheard-of thing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing his or her assets before it extends credit in any large amount . If this precaution was taken and the financial statement was found later to have been false , the store would have grounds for an objection to the discharge of the bankrupt . The truth is that the merchants have not wanted toscrutinize their charge accounts too closely . The strategy of American retailing has been to step up sales at the expense of stability . The craze for installment buying of everything from refrigerators to furs appears to be just as great to-day as it ever was , despite the number of retailers and consumers who have been badly burnt in the past few years . When a man whom I know bought a car last summer in upstate New York and wrote out a cheek for the full amount , the dealer was stunned with surprise . It was the first time anyone had paid him in full in cash in a year , he said . Credit . should presumably be harder to get to-day than three years ago , and yet I am told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so desperate are they to sell their merchandise . They will even trust a former bankrupt if they can convince themselves that he was to some extent a victim of circumstances . The legal profession must also take its share of the blame for the large number of bankruptcies in this country . Bankruptcy offers as profitable a field as negligence eases to that substratum of unscrupulous lawyers who are still allowed to practice . Three or four years ago the situation became so serious in the Southern District of New York that an inquiry was conducted before former Judge Thomas D. Thacher of the Federal District Court . The most interesting phase of the report was a comparative study of bankruptcy legislation in Canada and England . In both of these countries a system of suspended or conditional discharges is in effect . If a bankrupt can not pay as much as 50 cents on the dollar , or if he has brought on or contributed to his bankruptcy by rash or hazardous speculation or by gambling or unjustifiable extravagance in living or by culpable neglect of his business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knowledge that he was bankrupt , or if he has ever before been adjudged a bankrupt , his discharge may be either flatly denied or suspended for a period of years until he has paid dividends to his debtors amounting to .50 cents on the dollar . After two or three years this order may be modified if the bankrupt can show that there is no reasonable probability of his being able to comply with its terms . During the period of suspension , however , any property which the bankrupt may acquire may be taken over by the trustee for the benefit of the creditors . The courts in England take direct responsibility for the conduct of bankruptcy cases . The court , not the creditors , sets up the machinery for ascertaining the truth about a petitioner 's assets , and every bankrupt is examined at least once in open court by the Official Receiver , who is a government officer and who has much wider powers than our Referees in Bankruptcy . It is his duty to recommend to the Court that a discharge be denied if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also protects creditors against exploitation by former bankrupts , by making it a crime for a man to do business under an assumed firm name without disclosing the name under which he had been adjudged a bankrupt . This is only one of twenty-seven different offenses which are crimes under the English bankruptcy law . If , for instance , you obtain credit of so much as ten pounds , knowing that you are insolvent , you may be tried for a misdemeanor . If we had such a law in this country , providing for conditional discharges , examination in open court by an official of the government , and a search for assets to he made by the court , the number of bankruptcies would be greatly reduced , and the losses tocreditors would be considerably less . In England hardly 35 per cent of the petitioners report assets of less than 2.5 per cent , and less than one-fourth of the total get their final discharge . In this country two-thirds of the petitioners have no assets , the great majority are discharged , and the return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge Thacher is convinced that bankruptcy practice will continue to be demoralized " so long as we leave the enforcement of discipline to the initiative of scattered creditors . " As Solicitor General he drafted some time ago an amendment to the Bankruptcy Act which included among other changes , a provision for a system of conditional discharge similar to the English . But this bill was allowed to die in committee . The emergency bankruptcy legislation which was passed at the end of the Hoover administration will favor the debtor rather than the creditor , by facilitating composition agreements . Some members of the Bar are opposed to a law providing for conditional discharge on the ground that it would call for the setting up of a large new government bureau , whose function would be to examine the bankrupt , search for assets , and collect his payments . They argue that it would be a costly undertaking and that the opportunities for bribery would be as great as they are under prohibition . There are two answers to such arguments . First , a more stringent bankruptcy law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cost of maintaining such a bureau . Second , the plea that we can not find honest officials to enforce a law , is a poor reason for not passing it . The enforcement of prohibition is not analogous , for the community at large has not been in sympathy with the prohibition law . The present administration of the bankruptcy law is only another example of the growing tendency on the part of the courts to countenance mockery of the law and to abdicate their authority . In the final analysis it is the creditors and the lawyers who are responsible for the outcome . Even if a bankrupt appears to be perjuring himself , there is nothing the Referee can do about it , unless the lawyer for the creditors makes an investigation . I will admit that in the average run of civil cases the court can not be expected to examine into the veracity of a man 's oath . But bankruptcy is a more fundamental matter . If the law of the land allows a man to wipe out his debts with one gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owes something to society , too , for in this sort of case the morals of a people will not rise much higher than the level of the law . If this were not so , the cases of discharged bankrupts who are honorable enough to settle their debts when they are able to do so , would not make front-page copy . Reuben H. Donnelly , the well-known printer , is a famous example of a man who distinguished between what was legal and what was moral . The company with which he was associated failed in 1905 for $300,000 , the creditors receiving cents on the dollar . Twenty-three years later Mr. Donnelly paid off all the creditors ' claims and also added interest which amounted to another $300,000 . It may be that the crumbling of the average debtor 's conscience is only another symptom of the crumbling of the capitalistic system .
