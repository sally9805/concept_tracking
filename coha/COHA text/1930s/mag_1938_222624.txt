Feeling that Adolf Hitler is behind them , that Greater Germany is irresistible , the 800,000 Nazis who attempt to lead the 3,200,000 Germans in the Republic of Czechoslovakia ( pop . 15,000,000 ) , became highly truculent last week . Their Fhrer , obedient Konrad Henlein , fresh from conferences in Berlin with Gring and other Nazi bigwigs , staged a mass meeting in Karlsbad , the famed spa , delivered a series of ultimatums to Czechoslovak President Eduard Benes so outrageous as to shock even the now violently pro-German London Times . <P> Deploring the truculence of Henlein , the Times sternly voiced the hopes of ruling-class Britons that he was asking maximums , hoping to get something substantial . Although claiming to lead only 800.000 Nazis , * Henlein blustered demands that the Czechoslovak Government raise its Germans from the status of a " minority " to " equality , " scrap its treaties of alliance with France and Russia , reverse its whole foreign policy and line up with Greater Germany . <P> Orator Henlein professed to be uttering sentiments unanimously upheld by 75,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Hitler pooled all Germans everywhere into one ocean of German blood . He ended by defying openly for the first time the Czechoslovak statute which forbids the existence of a Nazi Party-it has hitherto existed in Czechoslovakia sub rosa , has not dared to use the swastika Nazi symbol . Daring the Government to enforce the law , Fhrer Henlein climaxed : " Naziism is the guiding principle of our Party , the same as it is for all Germans throughout the world ! It is unbearable for us if , in the future , we are persecuted because of our confession of this faith ! " <P> Thus the basis was laid for Greater Germany to intervene later , save the Sudeten Germans from " persecution . " If the Hungarians , Poles and other racial minorities in Czechoslovakia were to take similar stands and get away with them , the Republic would simply blow up-which would suit Hitler even better than having to intervene . In Budapest this week 20,000 Hungarian Nazis demonstrated , clamored " Czechoslovakia must be dismembered !
