Football , world 's most popular sport to watch , will draw 20,000,000 spectators on eight Saturdays this autumn . Seven hundred thousand young men will play it , some for a living , some for an education , some for fun . It will cost the U. S. sports public $30,000,000 . Last week football reached the mid-season peak of its most successful year since 1929 . <P> Crowds at college football games this year are roughly 12% above last year 's , about equal to those of 1929 . That this year 's figures are above last year 's is not entirely a sign of reviving prosperity . More than ever alive to the importance of the sport , college officials have rearranged their schedules . Instead of easy set-ups early in the season to prepare for climactic games later , most major teams now play able opponents exclusively , draw correspondingly bigger crowds . Rules designed to encourage forward passes and spectacular ground plays have made the game more attractive to spectators . New roads have made it easier to get to games while Repeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few late-season games drew more than 50,000 each . Last week 's two biggest were watched by 161,000 . <P> Gambling on football , traditional with undergraduates and alumni , has suddenly become a U. S. mania . Bookmakers , disgusted to find their customers losing interest in racetracks , began four years ago to quote football odds . Last week Ryan &; Co. , New York betting commissioners , handled $500,000 on Ohio State v. Notre Dame alone ( a record ) . Not new but flourishing 1,000% above last year is the sport , reputedly run by policy racketeers , whereby small investors buy lists of games for 10 or more , get paid 8-to-1 for picking four winners , 12-to-1 for six . <P> Controversies . Standard subject for gloomy collegiate editorializing for the past ten years has been " overemphasis " of football . This autumn it has received practically no attention . Likewise diminishing is the uproar about the pay that goes , directly or indirectly , to many football players at most U. S. colleges . When Tree-Surgeon Governor Davey of Ohio charged that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs , Ohio State officials were surprised only by the Governor 's indignation ( TIME , Oct. 21 ) . Last week Ohio State undergraduates threatened to throw fruit at Governor Davey if he attended the Notre Dame game . <P> Deaths attributable to football , a source of deep concern to preachers , coaches , and heads of college athletic associations in 1928 and 1931 , have aroused no indignation this year . By last week 19 football deaths had been announced . One Robert Mansfield , playing on an Oakland , Calif , sandlot , died when he ran head first into a telegraph pole . Andrew Crespino of New Orleans died of a heart attack during practice when he leaned over to tie his shoe . <P> Last week , surveying the U. S. football scene , experts concentrated their attention on the 17 major college teams which had reached mid-season undefeated and untied . When the weekend was over , only eleven emerged with records intact . Leading can didates for the mythical U. S. champion ship , the less mythical honor of playing in the Jan. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dame , Princeton , Minnesota , Southern Methodist , California , North Carolina , Texas Christian .
