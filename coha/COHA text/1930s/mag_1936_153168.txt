A banking decision handed down by a New York court last week gave pause to eleven Manhattan banks not involved in the litigation at all . Case was the suit brought by the U. S. Comptroller of the Currency to compel the members of the New York Clearing House to make good the losses of a fallen member , Harriman National Bank &; Trust Co. , which went under in 1933 as a result of the finagling of Joseph Wright Harriman ( TIME , May 4 ) . According to the Comptroller , the Clearing House banks had agreed the previous year to keep Harriman National afloat . Eleven Clearing House members , including such institutions as Chase National , National City and Irving Trust , settled out of court for some $3,600,000 . But the court held last week that the other nine members were quite within their rights in refusing to pay a penny . Read the decision : <P> " The clearing house committee of the New York Clearing House , or its chairman , as such , has no power to bind member banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such authority is not conferred expressly or implied by membership in the association . "
