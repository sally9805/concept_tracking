txt Mr. Neville Chamberlain , British Chancellor of the Exchequer , in his budget statement in the House of Commons today , while withstanding the pressure brought upon him not to balance the national accounts , has moved slightly in the expansionist direction . He has suspended the sinking fund . He has excludued from the accounts all liabilities and assets for war debts and reparations until more has been settled regarding these charges . This has enabled him to reduce the annual beer taxation by ? 14 , - 000,000 , and also to postpone in-come tax charges for six months to the extent of ? 12,000,000 and to i make other minor readjustments. and still end the coming year with the expectation of a balance on the right side of ? 1.200.000 . This is slightly better from the taxpayer 's viewpoint than had been anticipated . Heavy additional taxation amounting to 190,000,000 annually , besides retrenchment of ? 60,000,000 which has been enforced by the national government since the crisis of two years ago , had been successful in producing a balance between income and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burden upon trade as to have become almost insupportable . Chamberlain 's Compromise Although 25 per cent of the nation 's entire income went to the tax gatherer in the last year , nevertheless , a balanced budget was only maintained by partial discontinuance of the sinking fund for the national debt . This was because , in consequence of the trade slump , the soaring cost of unemployment relief , amounting last year to ? 83,000,000 , had largely wiped out the reduction of expenditure effected by economies and loan conversions . There was also a falling off of such serious proportions in the proceeds of income tax and customs duties as to suggest the beginning of a decline in the revenue-bearing capacity of all demands upon the tax payer . A strong movement had consequently arisen for relief all round and especially for reduction In the income tax , hitherto standing at the high general rate of five shillings in the pound . Mr. Chamberlain thus had to compromise between two diverging lines of policy . One of these lines was that of unbending financial orthodoxy based upon providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sinking funds regardless of the depressing effects such policy must have upon trade , upon unemployment , upon general living standards , and upon Purchasing power . Greater Purchasing Power The other line was the one advised by a number of leading economists . It was to enlarge general purchasing power and to set unemployed to work again at all costs , though to do so might mean some temporary departure from the narnow path hitherto pursued of a strictly balanced budget . Questions of inflation versus deflation , expenditure versus retrenchment , tax reduction versus tax enhancement were thus all involved . The course chosen by the British Government has been cautious , but it has been the more liberal for the fact that President Roosevelt 's policy is held here to be expansionist upon the whole . Not the least claim made for today 's British budget is that by aiming at raising commodity prices it tends to bring the United Kingdom into step with the United States . Budget Wins Approval Mr. Chamberlain 's statement had , upon the whole , a favorable reception from a crowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came when he said he Would follow the example set by his predezessor and meet by borrowing instead of by fresh taxation the nominal deficit of ? 32,000,000 with which the last year has closed . The next applause was when he showed he was in a position to snake at least some small remissions in taxation . A more doubtful reception was given to his announcement that the Government 's exchange equalization funds would be increased in order to reduce the fluctuations in sterling . This increase , he explained , had nothing to do with America 's embargo upon gold exports . The hopes of his hearers sank when he dwelt upon the possibility of damage to Britain 's high financial standing if the budget was not fully balanced , to rise again , however , when he disclosed that he had a ? 10,000,000 reserve fund saved up from the now converted 5 per cent war loan , which would give some temporary relief to 2,500,000 income taxpayers . This relief takes the form of reversing the arrangement made two years ago whereby the first half-yearly installment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the annual total to 75 per cent . Coliperative societies have escaped anticipated additional taxation for the moment , but power is to be taken to raise from them ** in the coming year by such methods as may prove least inconvenient to them . This is partly to raise more revenue , partly to remove the grievance from proprietory %tores in competition with the cooperative ones . The silk and artificial silk tariff is brought under the import duties board , thereby enabling its revision later this year . Stamp duty on new loans for industry Is halved . Tariff protection given to matches is slightly increased . One penny per gallon is placed upon heavy lubricating oil . Heavy road motor vehicles are to pay additional taxation proportionate to that on lighter forms of such means of goods transport . This is partly in the interests of the railroads . Mr. Chamberlain was loudly cheered when he concluded upon a note of hopeful prospects in the negotiations proceeding at Washington .                   @ @
