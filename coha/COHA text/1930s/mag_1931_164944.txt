The Society of Tammany , patriotic mainspring of New York City 's practical Democratic machine , violated its own by-laws for the 19th consecutive time last week when it allowed John R. Voorhis to continue for another year as Grand Sachem . Under its rules a Grand Sachem serves one year , can not be reelected . Mr. Voorhis was chosen Grand Sachem in 1912 when he was 83 . He has served ever since as honorary head of Tammany Hall through the inability of the Sachems to muster a majority vote in favor of someone else . Each passing year they have expected Time to settle their Grand Sachembarrassment by making a vacancy , but Mr. Voorhis , now nearly 102 and in good health , has continued to outsmart them .
