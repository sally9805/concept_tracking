Among the smokestacks that make St. Louis sooty are those of the chemical industry . Biggest chemical concern in St. Louis , and one of the biggest in the U. S. , is Monsanto , which operates one plant in St. Louis , another across the Mississippi in Illinois . Starting from scratch with the U. S. rights to a German patent on saccharin , Monsanto spent the first 20 years of its life shouldering its way to the top of the domestic fine chemical industry , the next 15 buying plants at home and abroad to consolidate a respectable position in the heavy chemical industry . For another $6,000,000 worth of expansion Monsanto last week prepared to offer its stockholders 101,310 shares of new stock at $60 a share . Underwritten by Edward B. Smith &; Co. , the offer will probably be snapped up , since even after a 19-point drop from its year 's high , Monsanto stock is currently selling at 84 . <P> Monsanto was founded in 1901 by John Francis Queeny , a St. Louis drug salesman . He figured he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money manufacturing them , scraped together $5,000 , began making saccharin . He gave the company his wife 's maiden name because he planned to keep on peddling drugs under his own . The company got to its feet slowly , did not down European competition in selling drugs to U. S. drug stores until the War . <P> Just before the heavy weather of the post-War depression , Drugman Queeny put out a sea anchor in Britain by buying a half interest in a Welsh concern making phenol ( pure carbolic acid ) . In 1929 Monsanto absorbed Rubber Service Laboratories with a plant in Nitro , W. Va . for producing chemicals used in rubber processing . Same year Monsanto acquired the Buffalo , N. Y. plant of Mathieson Alkali Works and Merrimac Chemical Co. at Everett , Mass. , oldest and largest New England manufacturer of heavy chemicals for the textile , paper and tanning industries . Monsanto has lost money in only three years since it was founded . The only deficit since 1904 was in the post-War depression . In 1929 earnings were $1,691,000 . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to last year 's record of $3,843,000 . <P> Founder Queeny died in 1933 , leaving Monsanto management to his son , Edgar Monsanto Queeny , who had been president since 1927 . Tall , dark , brisk President Queeny lives on a 500-acre farm in St. Louis County , rides horseback every morning before going to work . He boasts that " Monsanto 's net contribution to ... unemployment . . . was nil , " since he never laid off a man during Depression , has twice as many people working for him now as in 1931 . Satisfied , too , is Monsanto 's Queeny that the firm 's market is so diversified that no more than about 10% of Monsanto 's gross profit comes from any one of the more than 300 chemicals it manufactures .
