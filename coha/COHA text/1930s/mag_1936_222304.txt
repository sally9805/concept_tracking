In Colorado Springs , at their 14th national biennial convention last week , the Young Women 's Christian Associations reiterated their stand on birth control , unanimously voting to " put sex bootleggers out of business " by supporting legislation to permit dissemination by doctors of contraceptive information . <P> In the Catholic Holy Name Society 's Holy Name Journal appeared a blast at Mrs. Thomas Norvel Hepburn , birth control advocate and mother of Cinemactress Katharine Hepburn . What provoked this sheet to impolite language was Mrs. Hepburn 's recent statement that " birth control makes it possible for young people to get married and save up and have children when they really want them . ... It makes parentage a glorious fulfillment of their hopes instead of an accident of Nature . " <P> In Manhattan , home from a world tour , arrived the nation 's No. 1 birth controller , Mrs. Margaret Sanger , with much to say to the Press . In India , Mrs. Sanger said she obtained indorsements from 45 medical associations , founded 50 birth control centres , spoke at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any religious group . . . . Everybody accepted the idea that something must be done to halt the increase in population and the inevitable death of women and children . " <P> Mrs. Sanger spent three days with that half-forgotten little holy man , the Mahatma Gandhi. * He , said she , believes " that women should control the whole question of family-how many children and when . He went me one better on that score : I believe that men should say how many children and the women should say when . After all , the fathers have to support the children . " But Mrs. Sanger did not bring away St. Gandhi 's complete indorsement of her work . Explained she : " He just did n't know much about the subject . " <P> In Columbus , Ohio , the 32nd quadrennial conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church toyed gingerly with birth control . Placed before the 600-odd Methodist delegates was a memorial supported by Mrs. Sanger 's National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control and signed by three Methodist educators , one Manhattan minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Home Missionary Society . The memorial cited " indorsements " ' of birth control by Methodist regional conferences , by other Protestant and Jewish bodies . It urged that Methodism , indorse " the principles of birth control legislation now pending in Congress . " Sent to a committee the resolution quickly struck a snag . A subcommittee found it was " artfully drawn " in that " indorsement " was a misleading word for some birth control pronouncements mentioned in it . After killing this memorial the subcommittee set to work to draft its own views . <P> Other Methodist work done last week :
