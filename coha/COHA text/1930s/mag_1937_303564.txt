After the stock market dived to new lows at the start of last week , speculators began to take an interest in U. S. Steel shares , which could be bought as low as $86 ( year 's high : $126.50 ) . But the interest was mild-and very temporary . One morning blocks of Steel began to hit the thin market like a locomotive . All day in what swiftly became a 2,400,000 share avalanche , Steel showed the way downward , sagging to $80 on sales of only 83,600 shares , and the whole list tumbled along with it , setting another low mark for 1937 . The Dow-Jones industrial averages were off nearly eight points to 146.2 . At one incredible moment there was not even a bid for General Motors , whose 43,500,000 shares of stock in the first six months this year earned some $2.50 apiece and whose U. S. sales in August set a record for that month . G.M. closed at $47.50 ( 1937 high : $70.50 ) . <P> Next day while the market wavered around its low , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone else , launched an investigation into all transactions of U. S. Steel common during the previous three weeks , explaining in a questionnaire to all member firms , that it was only studying Steel as " the bellwether " of the market , not because of charges from Washington that " bear raiding " was behind the market 's latest drop . Such rumors spread so swiftly , however , that the Securities &; Exchange Commission dispatched a squad to Wall Street to run them down . <P> While other popular explanations of the week ranged from a theory that the market crack was another 1906 " rich man 's panic " to the notion that it was a " capital strike " against the New Deal , one fact became increasingly clear : whether or not pessimism over fall business prospects was at the root of the market 's drop , the market 's drop had certainly dragged down fall business prospects . <P> During the six-week decline no less than $15,000,000,000 in paper values have been wiped out . And the state of paper values has a potent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result , retail stores began to worry over fall sales . Estimates for fall steel production were revised from 75% of activity to 70% . New financing was postponed . And the National Association of Purchasing Agents , cagiest of all buying groups , saw fit to warn that buying should be " conservative " when there was so much uncertainty , even though there is " no real fear of a serious letdown " in fall business . <P> At the start of this week the market gave itself a breathing spell , the list climbed a few points back up the ladder . Meanwhile from a prime U.S. capitalist came a remark reminiscent of Andrew Mellon 's famed quip early in 1929 that " gentlemen prefer bonds . " Said Chairman Ernest Tener Weir of National Steel Corp. : " I think that the present situation can be made very serious unless people stock , look and listen . "
