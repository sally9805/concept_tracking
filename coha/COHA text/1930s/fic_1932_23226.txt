THE SHEPHERD 'S INTERVAL A STORY BY ELIZABETH MADOX ROBERTS T HERE were three men in the jail , Flynn Thompson and two others . On clear afternoons a shaft of sunlight would slant above the shadow of the courthouse wall until the dark moved upward and cut away the beam . Thompson would sit in the narrow segment of light and he would move his stool forward to keep the light on his shoulders while it shrank to a thread and went out altogether . It was an afternoon in spring . Leek Wolsey was speaking : " There 's a power of villainy out in the world . Amongst them that can gad around from place to place in fine cars and on their two legs is a power of villainous work . " Jinnie , a small man , lay on the bunk under the window , his feet in the air , and he treadled the air where the passing beam had been . The locks of his hair fell backward from his brow and his fingers played together above his breast . Wolsey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cursed and complained , as if he were on the way to a quarrel , if Flynn Thompson stayed near the small man . Watching now with content , his mouth drawn down at the corners in a pleased bitterness , his large lips bent and twisted , his wide nostrils quivering , Wolsey was speaking : " There 's villainy spread through the world . " He retold what he had read in the paper the jailer had left theday before with the midday food . He turned the paper again , reading . " That 's one graft I never tried . " " What graft is that ? " " lIe wrote to his brother . Said his mother was dead and he did n't have money to bury her . Old woman as well as anybody , still up and on foot . It 's a good graft to work once . " " Once I got a man to write to my sister . Said I was about to die with a bowel fever . Said send twenty-five if she could . " " Leo Sanders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's henroost . . . . Since Mollie Brown killed her first husband with a pitchfork and made the Coroner think he died with a cramp colic because he ate a mess of catfish on top of a. stomach full of whey . " The two , Leek Wolsey and Jinnie , were talking quietly together . There was a continual pleasantness between them . Flynn sat on a bench against the farther wall , now that the beam was gone , and the other two , his fellows in prison , kept together on the opposite side of the room . Their undefined bond led Wolsey , the strong ruffian , to he continually in defense , taking the other man 's part . At any slight dispute or argument he entered , ready to thrust and curse . Jinnie 's name had been Jimmie . He was soft and white like a. woman . It was thus each day through a spring . On days when there was no sunshaft the afternoon passed unmarked . Once a friend came to talk with Flynn , standing under the jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was conversation through the bars . Flynn had fastened a length of leather strap about the bar of an iron door , and he often pulled the ends of the strap back and forth , making of it a pulley . His muscles acted on the strength of the leather , forward and back , as if they talked , the power of the one to the power of the other . A content came to him from the strength of the strap and the reflected strength of his arms . Scarcely aware of the speaking voices of Wolsey and Jinnie , he worked back and forth . " Since Leo Sanders robbed his old mother 's hen coop all of a summer . . . Got killed in a ruction with his uncle over whether a man can have double pneumonia twice . " They began to play with the cards in the waning light , making profane comment upon the villainy outside , retelling one evil after another . " Since Henry Sid 's sluttish wife got him a red-headed youngone with a cast in his eye just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man burned up his clothes here . Linn his name was . Stripped of his clothes from his body and burned all up , a rag at a time , in the stove . " Wolsey had been in jail twice before . It used to be thus , and thus , he would say , telling . " They used to lock each man jack inside his own cell . That was a jailer now . . . . Times when Sattler poked a loaded gun through the bars whilst another man brought in the victuals . . . " The voices belonged to some segment of being which lay far beyond the actual , the present fact , of Flynn 's muscles pulling at the strap , of his strength pulling at his strength , overand over . The strap was long to the right and short to the left , but when it was pulled it grew toward the left and shrank at the right , and the worn , slickened surface of it slipped snugly through the openings between the iron bars . The voices continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinness of paper and were set against the air as fixed patterns . " Outside is a world of villainy . " The strap flap-flopped lightly through the bars and returned strength for strength , being predicted at every moment it was in movement . The action of the strap was real and near , identical with his straplike muscles , being the extension of himself that lapped through the bars , back and forth , hard pulled and hard resisting . Far removed from the acts of the strap , stood the hard , flattened , profane , obscene words : " Outside is a muck of villainy . " " Outside is a squash-shiss of dirt and slime . " " Men and women .. . " " Both kinds . " " At it day and night . " " Villainy . " " A squash-shiss of blood and slimy juices . " " Wherever blood runs , is villainy , " " Heave-ho , all together , and they all heave-ho . " " They ho-heave , prittle-prattle , dumb , dam , dim . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gravy . " Flynn had been in jail many days . The days rolled over , uncounted , for Wolsey and his companion had been there when he came and they would be there after he left . He had begun to take little account of the time . Outside the jail window arose a briek wall beyond an alley . An old horse was hitched almost daily to a post there . The horse stamped if there were flies on warm days , or it stood asleep , one foot limp and free , one leg eased from labor . " Amongst them that can traipse about . " " All fours is what they go on , really . " The lines of mortar between the stones ran evenly , but the stones were of different lengths . Some trowel had pinned the mortar into a line and wiped the useless ooze of it away , clearing the stone . Flynn knew each joint . His eyes traveled with content along the familiar lines of the mortar and rested in content on the worn places where men had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The voices that knocked from wall to wall , flat and hollow among the heavy stones , were a continual repetition of common sayings that passed between the speakers . " All fours . . . run here and there . . . on four legs . . . trough feeders . . . born villains and die the same . . . her fat arms . .. Miss Pansy . . . Miss Lilly May .. . Sluts like all the balance . . . all tripe and sausage . . . " Sometimes the recurring voices talked of his , Flynn 's affairs , asking questions for which they gave the answers . The voices beating together and alternating : " Ninety days is no long time iffen it 's yourself will hang or go to the chair maybe , but iffen it 's in jail for liquor traffic , it 's longer . " " Flynn Thompson , a man with booksense too . Reads hooks and papers . " " Could teach school . . . " " Could run a bank . . " " Book-sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I reckon . Got a daughter though . " " How does it feel , anyhow , to have a grown daughter ? " " Ask Flynn Thompson . A woman , your own , but not your own neither . " " Smart enough , he is . " " A gal , his own blasted youngone , grown up . " " His own property . " " A man could n't make free with ' er , his own no matter . She 'd whang ' iw one in the eye . " The speakers came clear again , Wolsey speaking , " Ninety days and three hundred dollars , Jinnie . Do n't forget three hundred dollars he paid . A hundred apiece for each act . He made liquor , he had it in possession , and he sold it . " His daughter , Mirandy , had helped raise the fine , giving her turkey money which she had saved for some other matter . He had been surprised that she had offered it , and sorry it was required . He had thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lambs would bring , to roll fatly in ease for a summer . The stars of the early night had wheeled up in the east , the great stars of Orion and Sirius , the little stiff-legged dog walking down in the south . Night after night Castor and Pollux above a confused design of lesser stars . The shed had been partly roofed over , and it opened toward the east . The nights at the still were coo/ . Wrapped in a heavy blanket , he had lain looking up at the stars in the brilliant winter sky . Jinnie was asking : " How is his daughter named ? I disremember . " " Mirandy , she 's called , " Wolsey answering . She , his daughter was strong , but her flesh , the little he knew of her , was soft like down . Nearly fourteen miles down in a westerly way  --  south by west , rather  --  over into the Bearwallow country but back again in a southerly slant , and there lay his own fifty-five acres of hill land . The house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside the barns , before a cornfield . A long crook scythe hangs against the meat-house wall , and four large flat stones bring one from the kitchen door to the iron pump . Down in the hollow , behind the house , deep in a thicket of hackberry and sassafras , was the still until the government agents wrecked it with axes . These facts spread as vague color over his thought while he rested from his work with the strap . One explosive moment stood clear , remembered sharply ; Pat Doran running up from the way of the creek giving warning , The agents of the law are at the still . They 're after it with axes . " " Married ? " Jinnie asked . " I dis-remember . " " No , not married . " " Oh , no , she never married . " " As far as I knew , she 's not married . " " But I did n't know far . " " I knew only a little piece of the way . " They were mocking . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , senseless and repetitious . They could not discern Mirandy even the little implied by their voices calling her name . She had never been to the jail to see him , but soon after he came there she sent him his change of clothing , all neatly darned and washed clean . She took the jail sentence as the mathematical consequence of the wrecked still . " Who 'll look after your ewes when they lamb , you here in jail , Flynn Thompson ? " " I heard once of a man had twenty ewes and some had three lambs apiece . When a ewe died in a birth the man could make some other sheep-bitch take the kid . " " She knows which is her own by the smell . Against a lamb is fairly horned she 's already smelled it . She 's equal to a woman the way you ca n't fool her there . " " Who 'll look after for you , now you 're in jail and the lamb season come and gone by maybe ? " " How many sheep you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many ? " " Ask Flynn how many . " " How many sheep , he says ? " " Eighteen or twenty , and one goat nanny . Mirandy will look after , " he answered them at last . The sheep wander over the stony hills and eat the herbs under the scrub cedars and the sassafras . They eat the rye cover crop some bright days in late winter . They spread here and there over the stony pasture where the timber has been cut away , and they climb among the dolomite crests . " When are the lambs born at your house , Flynn ? " Wolsey asking . " Sometimes I ca n't tell whe'r it 's February , " Jinnie said , " or is it May now , I 'll say to myself . Unless there 's something to mark by , you ca n't tell . " February , the third week , and all the lambs are born , counting backward to the autumn breeding , twenty-two weeks . He did not answer them . Forward to another autumn or backward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way the mind looked , one ram to eighteen ewes , with Son Lowry , a simple man , to help get the flock mated and to help at the horning . Son Lowry would come creeping up from his one-room cabin to help Mirandy ; and old Mrs. Kinuer in the kitchen would be frying the fat to make ready for supper . Her clay pipe on the mantel , her large full dresses hung on the wooden pegs behind the door  --  she was there . It was unsafe to give the sheep turnips just before the borning . Lowry would ' , mow that , with his twisted , one-sided mind in his little knot-head , walking quickly up toward the farther pasture to bring the ewes back to the barn for safe delivery . " Mirandy , she 'll have her hands full against eighteen she-sheep get two lambs apiece and maybe some three . I heard it prophesied this would be a three-times year for ewes , " question and reply , neither belonging to the stones , shed and rejected by the firmness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , long past . It must be after May , surely . " " The newspaper says May , but who knows ? It may be a month-old paper . Villainy reads the same , one time as another . " " Who stays with Mirandy , to keep away the boogers ? " " A lady , Mrs. Kinner . " They were talking of his affairs , asking minutely , reciting all that they knew . He was indifferent of their voices lifted in dispute or falling drowsily over repeated sayings . " The goats beyond Bearwallow have got extry long horns and the bald-faced ewes have got four youngones apiece this time . Wolsey bit downward on his jaws , growing loud and riotous . " Mrs. Kinner sits by the fire to spin . " " To sin , " Jinnie said , in mirthful clamor . " Sits beside the fire to sin , Mrs. Sinner does . " " Jinnie is a smart one . Outside is a lot of villains . Flynn Thompson is in jail for a crime . He made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamb is good borned the ewe knows it by the smell , but the ram , he do n't know one from ' tother , and cares a blamed sight less ' n he knows , God bless ' im . " " God bless ' im . " " The ram always was my favorite sheep . " " Let the old sheep-nannie take her slimy new-horned brats she was so keen to get borned , let her take the whole dirty parcel off to some God-forsaken ditch and shilly-shally there till doomsday . The ram , he wo n't care a blamed cross-eyed cuss Alen they all go glanders . " " What time does he shear his sheep , does Flynn Thompson ? " " What time ? " Jinnie asked , conveying Wolsey 's question . " Early in May . " " It 's as like as not May now . Will Mirandy shear ? Or knot-head Lowry ? Can knot-head Lowry shear a sheep in a proper way and not bloody the wool ? " The questions went back and forth , laced together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening , or morning , these processes laced back and forth . Sometimes , working at the strap , he would not be able to discern morning from afternoon , the coming and the inereming of the day from the waning and decreasing . Again : " How old is daughter Mirandy ? " " It 's nobody 's business but her own how old she is . " " No harm intended . Flynn Thompson himself is not much , if any , upwards of fifty . I take it she 's downwards in her twenties . " Wolsey turned the paper about to look for some matter he might want to read , looking for evidences of villainy among those outside , their doings being commonly reported in print . Mirandy was about twenty-three , Flynn reflected , counting the years upon his own remembered history . He had been twenty-three when he had married and she had been born not long after . She lived now more in the house than out of it , sitting beside a window , her head bent over a seam she might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other kind of thing to wear , she was the daughter of the house , the house 's daughter , his godchild . In the kitchen , contending with old Mrs. Kinner , wanting better cleanliness , better something or other , she was the daughter of Kate Riney . Out among the hens , calling chickens home from the rye stubble , her nose and her lower cheeks sunburned , wind-blown , tan and freckles on her neck to the place where her dress hid the flesh , she was his own , different from himself . Her breath quick and her upper lip beaded with a fine sweat , her face flushed pink , she was his own daughter , child of his hardihood , better than he himself could boast . Randy , Mirandy , Randy , with six , eight , seven , ten friends coming and going , " Where 's Miss Randy ? Where 's she at ? Whoop Randy ! Out of it ! Come on downstairs and light up the lamp for a party we 're here for . Twang on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up outen the bed , Miss Randy , and come on down stairs or we 'll send Pat Doran up after you . Come on down and light up the lamp . " Mirandy managed for herself very well . She kept her own secrets . Hearty and free in her ways , never mincing , he had seen her curl her lips at Si Denis , at Pat Doran . They were all turning around and around in a group , but now and then two turned faster than the rest , turned together , and floated off , married . They would float off together then , settled and out of the whirlwind . Mirandy and all that pertained to her , all that turned about her , floated away , seen apart , going , as a pictured whorl that made a far heavenly body , a little star cluster dancing around in a picture in a book . Outside in the alley the old brown horse leaned on three legs , resting the fourth . A sour sweetness came in through the jail window , a warmth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The eye ran along the seams of the wall and came to a focus when the old horse outside stamped a foot . A brisk step outside , and a man 's voice urged the old horse into action . The sound of the hooves receded and passed altogether . Outside , beyond the walls , beyond his gaze , lay the illusion of living  --  the world . It reached in a wide arc , but there were ends to it . On one side of the arc , outside of it , were Wolsey and Jinnie . On the other side , beyond also , lay the mortar joints that lapped evenlyunder their unevenness , going forward and back , to the right toward the east side of the heavens and to left on the west side . The world stood under the two alternate canopies , night and day , and at night the stars rolled by . He stood outside , watching . He saw himself as he had formerly been , inside the illusion , going out to tend the sheep , going out to plow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheep got their young . Night passed , and morning , a day and a night , succession following succession . The succession of light and dark was a pulse evenly throbbing . The day being warm , the jailer opened a door which had hitherto been closed , a door leading into another room . The unused room was bare , paved and walled with stone . There was but one object within and that was an iron pump which had once been used to supply water to the prisoners . The air from the opened room was dry and cool and the open door gave a draught that drew the outside air through the jail . When Flynn had felt the pleasant flow of moving air for a time be began to take to himself the small parts of the opened room . The walls were like those of the other room , like those already intimately possessed , but they were infinitely different at every point . The pump was unbroken , and when he lifted the handle and worked it up and down a stream of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightly on the floor and ran evenly , here and there , feeling its way toward some point . It was as if the water had in mind a place it would like to go and as if it rejected all other places . It ran a little way here and there until it had flowed across the large cell . The water ran down hill , Flynn murmuring , standing to contemplate what the water did . He viewed the water as if it were a friend , the fact of the water being a THE SHEPHERD 'S INTERVAL 68D near and intimate mental object , greeted here as one restored or renewed . He watched the water with quiet delight . " One time a man , it 's said here , hugged the hot stove into his arms , " the voices speaking . " What made him do it ? " " Nobody knew why . It 's against the law to hug a hot stove , nohow . " Wolsey laid the cards out in hands , four in each pile , and he drew his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . Jinnie came to sit at his right hand , and Flynn left the pulleys and took a place to the left . The cards flowed from hand to table , tossed lightly down or snapped to the board . The five covered a three and a four , and a nine fell under an eight and a three , but had power to sweep them from the table . The King played over a Jack and a ten , succession flowing irregularly but following the law . Unbroken laws were enacted on the top of the table , the lasting laws of numbers . Flynn rocked back and forth , playing his hands , sweeping the cards forward to shuffle , thrusting them out to have them cut , and doling them out in three small piles , turning the trump . " Iffen I could get my hands on Steve Goodin now , " Wolsey speaking . " A year since I saw his face , but it 's all the same with me . If I could get my strong grip around his skinny neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd hear his blasted , God-forsaken backbone crush to a pulp of Godforsaken sand . " The cards continued to enact law , making their law as they fell , and Jinnie said : " It 's a long time now . . . " " Long or short . Stab three times is what I did before , and the jury put me here for a year . Outside is villainy amongst all the kind that smirk , daylight till dark . How are you , Mr. Godby , Mr. So-and-so ? Eat dinner at my house on Tuesday . Villains . Men and women . Do you , John , take this woman here to be your lawful wedded wife ? He 's not sure he does , but he 's not sure about anything no-ways . As well as not , he says to himself . As well her as somebody else . He do n't aim to be tied up too tight . It would n't be anybody against lie could help himself . But there she is , raw meat and cider . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards fluttered , falling lightly . The cards had been marked so many times that none was distinguished . all being pinched and thumbed . Flynn played more with the cards than with Wolsey and Jinnie . He lost some advantage to Jinnie , and Wolsey became disputatious . " Three-handed , I said , three-handed , " Wolsey called out . He bit his large jaws together and curled his lips downward at the corners . He shifted his seat nearer to the smaller man 's chair . For a few minutes the game was a two-part play , Flynn against Wolsey , with Jinnie dropping his cards to give Wolsey advantage . Muttered curses ran with the angry gestures , and Wolsey snapped each card down to the board . " Three-handed , I said , three-handed , " he repeated , and he clung to his first angry thrust . When the game in hand was brought to an end , Flynn ceased to play . He went to the pump room and sat down beyond the damp line where the water had run toward the low level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the spout of the pump after the last pumping and it still fell now and then , a drop after a long interval , as the moisture in the spout gathered . The world , the earth , continued , himself being out of it . Mankind continued , a substance . a mass of matter , acting upon itself and upon the surrounding mass . It was a substance like any other substance , having life in it , reproducing itself continually , a colony of coral in a reef , a mass of yeast welling up from below . Over the substance were spread the characteristics of color and texture , as if it might crystallize in threes or fours or fives , and these were known in his mind as fraternity , affection , poetry , religion , wonder , fornication , art , fear , acts of every sort , judgments , imaginings . All belong to the lump and were a part of the mass . Mirandy going out to save the little turkeys from the minks , Mirandy smiling , full lips and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small movement in the general mass . They were swaying here and there , blown by their own wind , moving only a little , when the whole lump was considered . A race or a people was only a minute particle in the lump . A people might spread from a continent to another ; it was only a faint pulse in the general mass . Himself , his body , sitting here and now , beside the dripping pump , finding friendship in the fact of the water , with the truth of the water and the old fact that the water ran down hill , himself , thus , was still a part of the lump . The water ran so because the gravity of the earth dragged at it . He , as a part of the substance , had no claim upon the water in what it did , and no power to stay it beyond a few especial instances and for a short time . The world , the earth , continued , himself being outside it . Suddenly it was swept far outward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurled plunging , turning first one way and another , and it was wrenched completely out of its track . Night and day as fixed regularities were gone , and the seasons went . There was no year , no spring , no week , no polar turning . A great cold settled on the planetwhere the world had been . Glaciers piled everywhere on the land . The people were all dead . They , the substance , withered down under the cold and went out altogether . The animals were dead , both on land and in the seas . A million years passed . Another million . Again and again a million years , but there were no years . Time was gone . The world  --  the earth ? moved slowly back toward some sun . Voices were speaking : " I 'll lay ten to one Flynn Thompson , he 'll about hang himself with a strap . " " I wish he 'd go on and do it . I wish to God . . . " " I expect to wake up some day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You think I 'd be afeared to cut it down ? I 'd never bat one eye over it . " Thus his body would fall toward the earth . Hung by the strap , cut down by Wolsey 's sharp knife , it would break into many kinds , and each kind would find its own , some of it as matter and some as force . He looked intently at his skin , as if he would look within his flesh . Looking , he saw the act of seeing as it bent over the seen object . He saw men and women , over the earth , looking at the act of sight , saw them seeing observed flesh that looked hack again at their vision . The speakers : " I always suspicioned Flynn Thompson and his strap . I wonder the jail lets a man have a strap . " " Hang , he will . I wish he 'd hurry on and hang while I 'm of a mind to cut his blasted body down . " Outside the rain was falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before his eyes and , falling three inches , went into gray fog again . Warmth came into the room through an air shaft in the floor . Thompson knew that he would not hang himself , and he smiled at the act of hanging which stood before dissolution , smiling a pleased , changing , tightly twisted mouth that worked between his thin , shaven cheeks and became a tightly drawn , broad-lipped arc of decision and denial when the smile came swiftly to an end . Before the furnace was built under the house there had been a stove , Wolsey had said . Men used to heat the poker red hot and thrust it at the mortar joints . The voices were still speaking of him . " One time a man , it was said , bugged the hot stove into his arms . " " What made him do so ? It 's against the law to hug a hot stove nohow . " Flynn sat in the cool room of the pump . The voices sank away from further comment on his own state or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something well known , known to the speaker , something he did not know , retelling a half-told tale , conjecturing with worn-out guesses . One had robbed his mother 's hencoop through a whole summer . One had killed her first husband with a pitchfork . One had got a red-headed youngone with a cast in the eye by the way of villainy . One day while Flynn worked lightly with the strap the jailer entered with a broom to brush up the cells for the day , a task which came before the noon bringing of food . He came suddenly to the closed door where Flynn drew the leather , and he said : " Ill look up your time in the book . Seems you might be out one day this week . I kept it well in mind . Tomorrow , I think it might be . " Flynn did not know what day the calendar might be marking . He knew then that he had blurred the reckoning as it ran outside , having nothing inside by which to count but the irregular newspapers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Heshould be released on the tenth of May . He had lost a week somehow , had lived it unknowing . A vague sickness spread over him , to know that the weeks had tricked him and that he had been lost among them . Wolsey and Annie were seated at the table , restless for their noontime food and ready for it . The jailer 's assistant came with the basket and the pitcher of hot drink . Flynn went apart to eat his share . He wanted to free himself entirely now from the comment of the other two , to put their flat , senseless sayings and remote cursings beyond the reach of his ears , to touch the outside , to feel it , to know it , to enter into it , to take it up where he had left it , to know what there he should be wanting and how he should place himself with reference to the sheep , with reference to Mirandy . Would he reach home in time for the shearing ? Ought he to want to reach home in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shearing delayed . If the shearing were delayed , time should be delayed , or should be earlier than he feared it would be , if the season were advanced and the need for shearing come earlier . He felt a light nausea at the memory of the jailer 's words . The men at the table ate their food hurriedly , taking it from the basket , not troubling to place it on the table . They pushed the covers aside and thumbed and pawed their way quickly to the hot morsels . The familiar mortar joints would not tell him what day passed . He pumped fresh water for his cup and saw the stream splash to the floor and run away over the stones , seeking the lowest level . His head seemed twisted and shriveled in his desire to know , to penetrate the passing fact . Shortly after the food had been eaten the jailer returned to get the baskets . He came to the pump room and said : " I looked it out on the book and it 's to-day you can go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mind to . " Flynn Thompson walked out through the doorway of the jail into the brilliant light of day , the tenth of May . He staggered at the sudden rush of light that blinded his eyes , that closed his eyelids to a narrow slit . The pavement was white like silver , but the air and the ground beyond were brilliantly green . The trees were shaking softly , and over them drifted a mantle of greenery that was fresh and moist . Green lights filtered through uneven levels of moving green . He strode through the jail yard , blundering and uncertain , and when he came to the street he crossed it and entered an alley opposite . The shifting green of the trees followed him , spreading through the alley . A tree drooped with the weight of its new leaves that were fresh and unblemished , that were heavy with sappy moisture . When he had walked thus between scattered walls of wooden buildings and along high wire fences that were twined with the new greenery of the spring , and when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alley came suddenly to an end . He climbed a fence and walked through deep new grass and blossoming white clover . The pollen in the air attacked him and made him sneeze lightly , a sneeze that was not unlike laughter . Each burst of it was a coming necessity , delayed an instant , and was fully gratified with a burst of mirth . Some birds were flying overhead in long waves of motion , crying a twosyllabled cry that ran with the light breeze  --  coming , present , and gone , in waves of sharp clear song . In a field to the left a large flock of sheep was feeding in the sunshine , and the bucks and ewes were shorn of their wool . He left the pasture and walkedon the highroad that reached , white and brilliant in the sun . Cars ran by , going toward the town , and the motion of the swift vehicles was not unlike the motion of the birds in the air  --  coming , present , and gone . Flynn walked over a stile into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheep here moved lightly away as he came near , all of them newly shorn , and he prayed lightly to God that he might reach home in time for the shearing . Ten miles south by west now his home lay , the white house built high at the front and low at the back . A long crook scythe hangs on the wall of the meat house . Four large flat stones from the kitchen door to the iron pump , and the joy of drawing the water , his own , his well , his that his father had dug . On a northern slope at the end of this field some old thorn trees were flung about with white flowers . The green of the light had become his own now , acutely realized and accepted with delight , and it no longer stunned his senses and enfeebled his sight .

He transferred his delight in the haw blooms to his pleasure at reaching home in time for the shearing of his flock  --  Son Lowry making one-sided comment as he helped take the old buck to the stall where it would be penned for clipping . Shuffling his feet and swinging his hips , he walked down the slope toward the creek , he left the field and turned into a road where he crossed the water on a high iron bridge , swinging himself free of the chopping shuffle his feet made as they beat on the wooden floor . Beyond the creek he kept to the road and went westward . His feet plodded now , evenly plying the miles , getting him along smoothly and well , but his spirits leaped over the grass and darted here and there , over Terry 's plowed field where corn rows were laid out , the grain surely planted , over Terry 's white-eanvased tobacco beds far against the hill slope . He passed through a hamlet where three dwellings stood together , all closed now , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeds . Out of one of the houses voices came after he had passed , gentle sounds that mingled with a mild stirring of crockery : " I see Flynn Thompson go by . I reckon he 's out . " " How times does fly ! " " He 'll get home in time for the . . . " These voices came to him as he left the valley and mounted a low rise opposite . " Home in time . home . .. in time for the . . . " The stress on " time " the word that sang high and thin above the rest of the saying , and " In time for the shearing , " his thought made answer , made continual repetition . " In time , in time . " A car passed , bumping lightly over the uneven road , and three voices called " Hi ! " as the wheels bobbed over the ruts and the car dropped down toward the hamlet . The voices of the women were remembered continually over the sharp greeting of the men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time had flown . He had made a barrel of whiskey in his hollow , winter being the weather . The stars had shone brilliantly every night , and the cold had come down at nightfall . The cold stars overhead had been watching February as it was stretched down among men , a carpet for men to walk on . And then suddenly it was May under foot , May in the green of the grass and the green of the air . The yellow light was playing over , into , the dark green shadows ; and the sweet smells of May . He was walking back . He heft the road and walked again in a field to save a mile . At the end of a long rolling stretch of upward-rolling pastures and plowed fields he came again to a country highroad . There were dolomite stones standing high on each rugged summit where the land arose in cliffs , but between were wild pastures where sheep grazed . They were not yet shorn . Their fat backs rolled in round coats of mellow wool and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beat a light pulse in his throat . He would reach home in time for the shearing . He would see it done right . He came to a hamlet , Thornton , where five or six scattered houses were set , each on whatever rise the builder had chosen , regardless of right and left , of straight lines and angles . The houses lay here and there , reached by crooked lanes or field paths . At the place where two crooked roads came to meet the crooked road he had been traveling , a shop for mending stood unevenly in his path . Three or four men watched another as he leaned over the parts of an automobile which he had dismembered . The bolts were laid out in rows as they had been removed , spread on the ground . Ili , Flynn Thompson ! Here 's he , back again . " " Flynn ! Out and free . God 's own sake ! " " Home on May tenth , like I told you . May the tenth , I said . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were loud in their greetings and they all shook his hand . " Home in time , " they said . " Hoo-ree ! " " I 'm home in time , " he said . " And God 's own grace I am . Home in time for the shearen . " " Hear Flynn Thompson make a joke . Shearen ? What shearen ? " " Shearen , I reckon . Call hit shearen ! " " Who gets sheared . That 's always the question . " I got sheared , that I well know . Kate Sweeny sheared me . " " That 's a new thing surely . He calls a wedden a shearen . " " What wedden ? Who 's to marry now ? " " Hear Flynn ask it ! " Then Tobe Lanham went into the cool dark of the shop where the water was dripping slowly from a tub and the fire burned slowly on the forge . Out of a locked closet behind the forge he took a vessel , and he passed drink lightly about , each one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " or " God 's own sake ! " or some such pleasantry , until all had taken a little of the drink in honor of Flynn 's coming . " How times does fly ! " " Only yesterday Flynn had a load of sour mash , and he said to me . . . " " He said to me , ' Against I sell my liquor ... " " Here 's good luck to the wedden , " one said . " What wedden ? " " Hear Flynn Thompson , still at his joke . Here 's good luck to the shearen , if you 'd rather . " " A rose by any other name is exactly as sweet , they say . " " All right then , the shearen , " Tobe Lanham said . " Here 's good luck to the shearen . Long life and prosperity , for better or for worse , richer or poorer , sickness or health . Gentlemen , I give you a toast , ' The shearen ! " They drank it solemnly , " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun outside the smithy door and he knew that it stood less than an hour from the setting . He called out a farewell and strode out into the late light where the green air was slowly turning to yellow as the sun slanted down into the west . Flynn walked on through the increasing coolness of the May evening and the sun gathered a great flame of clouds to the west to make a splendid setting . The red and gold spread halfway across the heavens by the time the remembered hills and knolls of his own close neighborhood came to view . The beauty and the pleasantness of his own ridge came to him where familiar trees stood above familiar patches of briars and stiff cliffs of dark stone . In the hollows were running streams . There had been rain enough . After he had walked over the brow of a ridge , taking the uneven road at an easy slouch-gait , he came in sight of his own land and he saw his own pasture , dotted with scrubby trees , rolling unevenly backward toward a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road . Anxiety beset hint ; there were no sheep in the field . He stopped to peer toward the hill , listening , but no sheep bell clattered and no lamb gave a bleat . The road went down the way , sloping lightly , and the dark approached . Then the road rounded a small rise and brought his sheds and shelters into view . A large white barn to the right , the cattle lowing as if they had been milked and would now like to be back at the pasture , and the swine were crying out at the trough . In the pen where the newborn of the herds and flocks were commonly kept some dark shadows gathered together , sheep gathered in for shearing or calves gathered for weaning . He walked over the flagstones and went straight to the door of the house . Mirandy was coming down the stairs in the hall . She looked at him , her face moving with pleasure . She wore a fine gown that rustled and crinkled as she walked down the steps , and her fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her feet on the treads . She carried a lighted lamp in her hand . " I knew you 'd come in time , " she said . " I held off till you got here . " She was large and splendid , grown to be a woman . He had not remembered how much this was true . There were little waves and crinkles in the brown of her hair which was combed in a fine smooth way back from her brow . She shook his hand , and her grasp was firm . " What ails you , Randy ? " he asked . She laughed and her white teeth glistened in the light of the lamp . " In time , in good time . I knew very well he 'd come . " In the dining room the table was stretched to its longest length and spread with a white cloth on which a fine array of food was set . There was laughter . Out of the kitchen came a clutter of tin and a tapping of feet . Then , hearing his voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for she was tasting something , blowing at the spoon to cool it . She cried out that she never expected it but that he was well in time . At the same moment Pat Doran came from the outside , and Si Dennis followed close at his elbow , and they were both shaking his hand and crying out " Howdy do " and " Welcome home " and " Randy said he 'd be here in time . " Dennis said it was a miracle how it all worked out at the same hour . By this time Flynn could scarcely discern what might be about to happen , and so he backed toward the wall and waited while a group came scattering into the room . A newer gladness spread from face to face as they came into the room and saw him , and he wondered now , seeing that there would likely be a wedding , which man Randy had chosen . In a minute or two more , while the guests were shaking his hand and all talking together and at once , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most distraught , and he allowed his thought to settle on him as the bridegroom . " Do n't name the place where he 's been , " they said . " We 're all here now , all come . " In his own room , behind the parlor , the pleasant jargon followed him , and there in the dim light of the smallest lamp he washed the last filth of the jail away and put on the fresh clean clothes Randy had laid out on his bed . Pat Doran came inside the door , as if he would speak to him privately , but he was bashful under his hardihood , and he only pursed his mouth slightly in amused distress , and he dropped his head and walked quickly out . His act was a sufficient promise of decency and a sufficient request for Mirandy 's hand , and Flynn hurried his dressing to join the throng outside . By the time he had prepared himself the preacher had come , and with his coming there was a hush over the gathering and a sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Randy to take Pat Doran 's arm and walk before the minister , and while he stood thus he saw near him , against the white of the wall , a small round knot-head where a cast of the eye bent the vision up and down without good reason . It was right that Lowry should come to the wedding . Flynn moved a trifle nearer to the wall and he said : " The shearen , what about the shearen ? " " We waited for you to come . We allowed you 'd be here by the tenth of the month , and the law said the tenth for you , as we remembered . And so we said we 'd wait , Randy said . We brought the sheep into the calf pen by the barn to be ready to shear tomorrow soon in the morning . " Randy was taking Pat Doran 's arm and she was walking up before the preacher . She was ruddy as the sunset had been , and she was smiling while the preacher called her name .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
