txt The British yacht won again today , When Endeavour led Rainbow over the finish line by fifty-one seconds . For the second time in eighty years an English yacht has two legs on the America 's Cup , and this time it seems that she will win . She is apparently faster , well handled and has a skipper in T. 0 . M. Sopwith who is every bit the equal of Harold S. Vanderbilt , despite the American 's longer experience . It was a race which started with tire challenger snatching advantage from her rival at the line , to the rattle of blocks against metal masts , slow swells slapping against the bows in white foam , and the big yachts heeled over in a wind which drove them down to their sailing lines . Not a strong wind , it was fresh , and held so for the first leg of the course , and at the beginning it provided one of those epic moments in yachting of which men talk for years afterward . There has been little good weather in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than is usual in an international cup contest . The sky was gray and it was foggy when the fleet put out to sea . There was a thick mist that made clothing damp and made spectators don raincoats . But as the line was approached the wind freshened , having shifted overnight to the west-northwest , and began to blow a steady sailing breeze that was .. torrla meosemzem , taoto. 9r 0 111 SOPWITH. from ten to fifteen miles an hour , increasing up to the second turn . President Roosevelt once again was a keenly interested follower of the duel between the two sleek racers , seeing the contest from Vincent Astor 's yacht Nourmahal . Endeavour went ? out under sail . She was towed outside Castle Hill with her mainsail up and then cast loose and sailed out to the line , keeping well ahead of the following power craft . It gave some idea of the speed of these big boats to see her leading them out , arriving at the line ahead of them and cruising up and down , while yachts , liners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the patrol boats . There is nothing slow about a cup yacht in a good wind . Rainbow was towed out and did not hoist her sails until on the line . A Decisive Contest . Today 's race was triangular , first a close reach to the east of Block Island , then a beat to windward toward Point Judith and finally a broad reach back to the mark . This last leg was Intended to be a run , but the wind shifted slightly to the north and brought the wind on the boats ' quarters . It was not the sort of race watch yachtsmen like to see , but it was nevertheless decisive . There has seldom been more eacitement at the beginning of a cup race than today . Mr. Sopwith has gone up steadily in the estimation of yachting men since the fiasco of Saturday , and after yesterday 's contest they were conce9ling that he was a helmsman of ability and nerve . But today he showed a dash and judgment , a cool head in a tight spot which marked him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something of the hedge-hopping young aviator who set records in his youth in airplanes which held together more by - luck than engineering skill . Ho - drove Endeavour as one would a spirited horse , keeping her nose up and in front , forcing her with whip and spur . It was a race of races . Gets Away Too Fast . When the two yachts came together before the start Mr. Vanderbilt got into the weather position as usual . He has done it in all thre0 starts , and is admittedly a master at coming to the line in the more favorable position . But just before the starting signal , as they were headed for the line , the Rainbow got away a little too fast and before they reached the line Mr. Vanderbilt had to luff . He stood the Rainbow up for a moment , her sails shwtring , killing : time , while behind him to leeward the Endeavour was coming like a blue whirlwind . Mr. Sopwith had timed his start to the second . While Rainbow hung on the wind , losing headway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , going at full speed , . tore under his lee and as they squared away on the first tack Endeavour was out in front . She was clear of Rainbow ; that fatal moment when Rainbow was in danger of overreaching the line and had to slow up had made all the difference in the world . It is axiomatic that most yacht races are won at the start . Yachtsmen Are Thrilled . But the way that Endeavour tore under Rainbow 's lee and pulled ahead of her was so thrilling that those on the spectator fleet who knew the fine points of yacht racing were dancing in their shoes . It was the sort of thing that is seldom seen , and it placed the British boat in a position which she never relinquished . It also raised Tom Sopwith 's reputation several notches . He literally pounced upon his opportunity , and it had not been quite expected of him by those whohave not seen him race on the other side . That was merely the beginning of the tenseness of the situation , for-as the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was steadily increasing her lead . That initial momentum had placed her in a position where she could foot faster and head higher , and she gradually worked up to windward until the Rainbow was squarely behind her . From the ships alongside it could be seen that Rainbow was running through the white water from the Endeavour 's wake . It was an astonishing accomplishment , one which had taken rare skill and good judgment as well as a good boat . From that moment Endeavour never lost her advantage . The Rainbow lay behind her as if on a tow line . Mr. Vanderbilt could be seen at times going forward to stand under the big Genoa jib , leaving the wheel to other hands . There was no copying on the part of Endeavour today . Instead , she led in the selection of sails and the use of them . The first race was sailed pretty much on Mr. Vanderbilt 's formula . He set the tacks and picked the sails and Mr. Sopwith followed , feeling out his adversary as a man feels the contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yesterday he showed more independence , and today he led the pace . Staysails Are Set . After a time , as the wind freshened , he set a staysail inside the big Genoa , and after a few minutes Mr. Vanderbilt followed suit , which in view of the latter 's skill at bridge is not meant as a pun . The two boats tore ahead , leaning far over but with Endeavour a bit stiffer , while the water tossed from them . Their speed was a little more than ten miles an hour , so that the power yachts following them were turning over their engines at more than half speed . There was not quite the large fleet following today that there was yesterday , and it could not compare with that of the first day . On Saturday the line of masts along the horizon made one think of a forest after a fire , bare timbers against the sky . But today the small yachts had been discouraged by the tossing of yesterday , several at the big liners had disappeared , and only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones who clustered around the finish line , were out to see the race in slate gray water and under lowering skies . Adds to Her Lead . The lead which Endeavour gained on that first dash she kept to the first mark , and there when she rounded the buoy and turned toward Point Judith on a long tack she kept ahead . Much to every one 's surprise , she increased her lead on this leg of the race until the Rainbow was two-fifths of a mile behind . It had not been supposed to be Endeavour 's best point of sailing , but the conditions of the water , the swell , or something , gave her a smoother lift than she had yesterday and she went ahead steadily . When she came about she lost a little on the turn , and Rainbow closed up . Down the last leg the big yachts ran through a lane of craft stretched out far on either side . For the first time , President Roosevelt , on te Nourmahal , came up within the lines of the Coast Guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This led to one unfortunate incident , when Captain J. F. Hottel of the Coast Guard warned the cutter Mendota not to interfere with the President 's view unless it wished to be put outside the lines . The Mendota had been careful at all times to stay out of the line of vision of the Nourmahal , but as it carried nearly all the newspaper correspondents and photographers , radio men and , more particularly , the English newspaper men , it was forced so far behind and to one side that few pictures could be obtained , and it was often difficult to see the yachts . The English correspondents who had come from abroad to see the races were quite indignant . But the last leg was more or less a procession , and for once the American yacht was on the end of the tow line . Rainbow did close up some , gaining 40 seconds on the broad reach , but it was a hopeless chase . There was no catching that fleeting blue boat ahead , sliding steadily through the water , lifting slowly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . Hunting a Ghost . It was the kind of stern chase which breaks a skipper 's heart , and Mr. Vanderbilt and the rear guard of the Rainbow must have felt that they were hunting a ghost . The finish line was ahead . The big yachts grouped around and the two cup racers slipped through between the moaning whistle buoy and the committee boat , the Endeavour nearly a minute in the lead . As Endeavour passed the line she hauled down her headsails , and as Rainbow came abreast of her and doffed her headsails also the two yachts drifted side by side , while their captains shouted congratulations . Is was the first time Endeavour had permitted her rival to come alongside , and there was something in the attitude of that bright blue hull lifting on the water that suggested she would try very hard not to permit it to happen again . There is another race tomorrow , and four will take the cup .                    @
