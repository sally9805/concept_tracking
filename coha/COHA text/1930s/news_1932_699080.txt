txt Although City Clerk Michael J. Cruise certified to the Board of Elections yesterday that there was a vacancy in the office of Mayor , to be voted on at the November election , it appeared certain that the courts would be called upon to decide whether Joseph V. ? is Mayor for the rest of the year or for the remaining part of the term vacated by James J. Walker . Tammany lawyers , headed by John T. Dooling , chairman of the Tammany Hall law committee , presented an interpretation of the city charter , the State Constitution and the election law that supported the stand taken by Mr. Cruise . Abraham S. Gilbert , Republican , a well-known election law authority , took the view that no Mayoralty election could be held until November , 1933 , and this view is known to be shared by other lawyers who did not join the controversy . S. Howard Cohen , president of the Board of Elections , said the matter would be taken up at the next meeting of the board on Sept. 7 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certification of the City Clerk as to the offices to be filled at the next election . Taxpayers ' Suit Expected . Officials of the board declared that if a taxpayers ' action were brought , as is expected , to test the legality of a special election this Fall , it probably could be brought as soon as some action was taken by the Board of Elections , and probably on the technical ground that it involved an unnecessary expenditure of city funds . Others raised the question as to whether a restraining order even could be sought until the name of the candidate had been ordered placed on the ballot by the board , after the conventions at which the candidates would be chosen , but Board of Elections officials disagreed with that . point of view . In Albany , the question was taken up by the Attorney General 's office , in anticipation of a legal request from the Secretary of State as to whether the place is to be filled at the election this Fall . The certification of the Board of Elections is transmitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview yesterdays was asked if he knew whether he would serve as Mayor until the end of this year , or whether his term would run until Jan. 1 , 1934 . His answer was that he was not in a position to express any opinion , as he had given no thought to the matter . Dooling for Vote This Year . The argument presented by Mr. Dooling was , on the face of it , a strong one for the election this Fall . He cited Section 6 of Article 12 of the Constitution , enacted in 1923 , which provides that the election of all city officials except to fill vacancies , shall be in odd-numbered years . He quoted Section 30 of the public officers law , Chapter 51 of the laws of 1909 , which reads that " every office shall be vacant upon the happening of any one of the following contingenies . . . Subdivision 2 , his resignation . " He argued also that the City Charter , Section 23 , provides that the President of the Board of Aldermen shall act as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence , and that in case of a vacancy , shall so act until noon of Jan. 1 of the year succeeding the election at which a Mayor 's successor shall be chosen . The charter made it clear , he declared , ' that there was a. vacancy and that , therefore , it came under the purlieu of the " except to fill vacancies " of Article 12 , Section 6 of the Constitution . Case of Thacher Cited . IMr . Dooling cited also a case decided in the last five years by the Court of Appeals , involving the present Mayor of Albany , John Boyd Thacher . The case is O'Connell vs. 1Corscadden , 243 N. Y. 86 , in which the Court of Appeals , writing per curiam , said : " William S. Hackett , Mayor of the City of Albany , died on March 4 , 1926 , and on the next day John Boyd Thacher , President of the Common Council , became Acting Mayor pursuant to Section 51 of the second class cities law , The courts have i been asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor during the unexpired term of Mayor Hackett , or only until the first of next January . In the latter case , an election of a successor to Mayor Hackett must be held this coming November . The Courts below have held that the president of the Common Council acts as Mayor until Jan. 1 next . " The court then quoted Section 51 of the second class cities law , in terms identical with those of the New York City charter , that the President of the Common Council shall serve until noon on Jan. 1 of the year succeeding the election at which a Mayor 's successor shall be chosen . The court then continued : " It is the claim of the appellant that this provision does not refer to the next succeeding election day after the vacancy occurs but does refer to the election day at which a Mayor can be elected under the charter . " We think this is not and could not have been the intention of the Legislature in writing the section . Such an unnecessary and clumsy way of expressing such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provisions of law where a successor or an appointee is to fill an unexpired term , the Legislature specifically says so . It - leaves no doubt about it . Gilbert for 1938 Election . Mr. Gilbert , in his opinion , declared the question involved the construction of Article 10 , Section 5 , and Article 12 , Section 6 , of the Constitution , together with Section 23 of the city charter . He outlined the case against election this Fall as follows : " Section 5 of Article 10 provides that in the case of elective officers no person appointed to fill a vacancy shall hold office by virtue of such appointment longer than the commencement of the political year next succeeding the first annual election after the happening of the vacancy . " Section 6 of Article 12 provides that all elections of city officers , ex ? cent to fill vacancies , shall be held in odd-numbered years . Obviously , the exception in Section 6 of Article t'C 12 was inserted to meet the situation covered by Section 5 of Article 10 , which does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year . " When we read the two sections together we find that the Constitution provides that all city officers must be elected in odd-numbered years , except in the case of a vacancy , which must be filled by appointment , when the election may be held in an even-numbered year , because the appointee can not hold over , under the provision of Section 5 of Article 10 , for another year . " Section 23 of the charter is entirely clear in its provision that ' in case of a vacancy in the office of Mayor , the President of the Board of Aldermen shall act as Mayor until noon of the let of January succeeding the election at which a Mayor 's successor shall be chosen . ' If the vacancy occurs in an odd-numbered year , an election is held that year ; if it occurs in an even-numbered year , the President of the Board of Aldermen holds over until the election occurring in the following oddnumbered year . Thinks Must Serve . " The vacancy in the office of Mayor has occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charter , Mr. , an elected ' official , has succeeded to the office of Mayor . He has not been appointed to the place . Therefore the limitation in Section 5 of Article 10 does not apply . In my judgment , he continues to be Mayor , filling that vacancy until the next election at which Mayor Walker 's successor can be elected by the people of New York , which will be November . 1933 . " There is still one other view which I believe to be unimportant to argue and that is that there is no ' vacancy ' as indicated by Section 5 of Article 10 of the Constitution . The ' vacancy ' referred to by that section is one which must be filled by appointment . Here there is no appointment . The charter , in effect , makes provision for a Mayor and a Vice Mayor . When the Mayor dies or resigns , or is removed , the Vice Mayor becomes Mayor . " Mr. Gilbert said he had no doubt that if the courts decided that a successor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walker could be a candidate to succeed himself . Jacob A. Livingston , former Republican leader of Brooklyn and a member of the Board of Elections for the last twenty years , agreed with the stand taken by the City Clerk and Mr. Dooling that there must be an election this Fall . Many Democratic lawyers , as well as Republican , are understood to believe the question is not settled , one way or another , by existing court decisions , and that the question will reach the Court of Appeals before election day . Cruise Certifies . Vacancy . Mr. Cruise 's certification of the existence of a vacancy , as transmitted to the Board of Elections , follows : " In accordance with Section 69 of the election law , I hereby certify to you that there is a vacancy in the office of Mayor of the City of New York , to be voted for at the general election , Nov. 8 , 1932 . " The section referred to merely says that the City Clerk shall certify to the Board of Elections what officers are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if any such officer is to be elected to fill a vacancy , the certificate shall so state . " If there is an election this Fall for the office of Mayor , the opposing candidates will not be picked at the primary on Sept. 20 , as the time for filing designations has expired , but will be picked at city conventions of the members of the five county committees of each party . The number of county committeemen for the entire city runs into the thousands , each district club having its own county committee , with several members from each election district . They are the election district captains and their assistants , the backbone of the party organizations . 1
