GOODNESS is easier to recognize than to define ; only the greatest novelists can portray good peo- ple . For me , the least unsatisfactory description is to say that any thing or creature is good which is discharging its proper function , using its powers to the fullest extent permitted by its environment and its own nature , though we must remember that " nature " and " environment " are intellectual abstractions from a single , constantly changing reality . Thus , people are happy and good who have found their vocation ; what vocations there are will depend upon the society within which they are practiced . There are two kinds of goodness , " natural " and . ' moral . " An organism is naturally good when it has reached a state of equilibrium with its environment . All healthy animals and plants are naturally good in this sense . But any change toward a greater freedom of action is a morally good change . I think it permissible , for example , to speak of a favorable mutation as a morally good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A change is made and a new equilibrium stabilized . Belowman , this happens once for each species ; the change toward freedom is not repeated . In man the evolution can be continued , each stage of moral freedom being superseded by a new one . For example , we frequently admire the " goodness " of illiterate peasants as compared with the " badness " of many town dwellers . But this is a romantic confusion . The goodness we admire in the former is a natural , not a moral , goodness . Once , the life of the peasant represented the highest use of the powers of man , the farthest limit of his freedom of action . This is no longer true . The town dweller has a wider range of choice and fuller opportunities of using his powers . Similarly , there is natural and moral evil . Determined and unavoidable limits to freedom of choice and action , such as the necessity for destroying life in order to eat and live , climate , accidents , are natural evils . If , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boarding-house , knowing that vitamins are necessary to health , continue for reasons of gain or laziness to feed my guests on an insufficient diet , I commit moral evil . Just as moral good tends to pass into natural good , so , conversely , what was December 24 , 1938 natural evil tends with every advance in knowledge to become moral evil . The history of life on this planet is the history of the ways in which life has gained control over its environment . Below the human level this progress has taken place through structural biological changes , depending on the mutations or the chances of natural selection . Only man , with his conscious intelligence , has been able to continue his evolution after his biological development has finished . By studying the laws of physical nature , he has gained a large measure of control over them and in so far as he is able to understand the laws of his own nature and of the societies in which he lives , he approaches toward that state where what he wills may be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " is consciousness of necessity . " Man 's advance in control over his environment is making it more and more difficult for him , at least in industrialized countries with a high standard of living , like America or England , to lead a naturally good life , and easier and easier to lead a morally bad one . Let us suppose , for example , that it is sometimes good for mind and body to take a walk . Before there were means of mechanical transport , men walked because they could not do anything else ; that is , they committed naturally good acts . Today a man has to choose whether to use his car or walk . It is possible for him , by using the car on an occasion when he ought to walk , to , commit a morally Wrong act , and it is quite probable that he will . A society , then , is good in so far as ( a ) it allows the widest possible range of choice to its members to follow those vocations to which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and providing new vocations which make a fuller demand upon their increasing powers . The Greeks assumed that the life of intellectual contemplation was the only really " good " vocation . It has become very much clearer now that this is only true for certain people , and that there are a great many other vocations of equal value : human nature is richer and more varied than the Greeks thought . No society can be absolutely good . Utopias , whether like Aldous Huxley 's Brave New World , or Dante 's Paradiso , because they are static , only portray states of natural evil or good . ( Someone , I think it was Landor , said of the characters in the " Inferno " : " But they do n't want to get out . " ) People committing acts in obedience to law or habit are not being moral . As voluntary action always turns , with repetition , into habit , morality is only possible in a world which is constantly changing and presenting a fresh series of choices . No society is absolutely good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at a community at any given moment , we see that it consists of good men and bad men , clevermen and stupid men , sensitive and ' insensitive , law-abiding and lawless , rich and poor . Our politics , a view of what form our society and our government should take here and now , will depend on ( a ) how far we think the bad is due to preventable causes ; ( b ) what , if we think the causes preventable , we find them to be . If we take the extremely pessimistic view that evil is in no way preventable , our only course is the herthit 's  --  to retire altogether from this wicked world . If we take a fairly pessimistic view , that badness is inherited  --  that is , that goodness and badness are not determined by social relations  --  we shall try to establish an authoritarian regime of the good . If , on the other hand , we are fairly optimistic , believing that bad environment is the thief cause of badness in individuals , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a belief in some sort of democracy . Personally I am fairly optimistic , partly for reasons which I have tried to outline above and partly because the practical results of those who have taken the more pessimistic view do not encourage me to believe that they are right . What , then , are the factors which limit and hinder men from developing their powers and pursuing suitable vocations ? 1 . Lack of material goods . Man is an animal , and until his immediate material and economic needs are satisfied , he can not develop farther . In the past this has been a natural evil : methods of production and distribution were too primitive to . guarantee a proper standard of life for everybody . It is doubtful whether this is any longer true ; in which case it is a moral and remediable evil . Under this head I include all questions of wages , food , housing , health , insurance , and the like . 2 . Lack of education . Unless an individual is free to obtain the fullest education with which his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society . This does not mean that everybody should have the same kind of education , though it does mean , I think , education of some kind or other , up to university age . Education in a democracy must have two aims . It must give vocational guidance and training , assist each individual to find out where his talents lie and then help him to develop these to the full  --  this for some people might be completed by sixteen ; and it must also provide a general education , develop the reason and the consciousness of every individual , whatever his job , to a point where he can for himself distinguish good from bad , and truth from falsehood  --  this requires a much longer educational period . At present education is in a very primitive stage ; we probably teach the wrong things to the wrong people at the wrong time . It is dominated , at least in England , by . an academic tradition which , except for the specially gifted , only fits its pupils to be school teachers . My private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vocational training  --  should be in early adolescence , the twelve-to-sixteen group ;  --  and again in the latter half of the university period ; but that the sixteen-to-twenty age group should have a general education . 3 . Lack of occupations which really demand the full exercise of the individual 's power . This seems to me a very difficult problem indeed . The vast majority of jobs in a modern community do people harm . Children admire gangsters more than they admire factory operatives because they sense that being a gangster makes more demands on the personality than being a factory operative and is therefore , for the individual , morally better . It is n't that the morally better jobs are necessarily better rewarded economically : for instance , my acquaintance with carpenters leads me to think that carpentry is a very good profession , and my acquaintance with stockbrokers to think that stockbrokerage is a bad one . The only jobs known to me which seem worthy of respect , from the point of view of both the individual and society , are being a creative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research scientist , a doctor , or farmer . I do n't myself much like priggish phrases such as " the right use of leisure " ; I agree with Eric Gill that work is what one does to please oneself , leisure the time one has to serve the community . But we must never forget that most people are being degraded by the work they do , and that the possibilities of sharing the duller jobs through the whole community will have to be explored much more fully . 4 . Lack of suitable psychological conditions . People can not grow unless they are happy , and even when their material needs have been satisfied , they still need many other things . They want to be liked and to like other people , to feel valuable , both in their own eyes and in the eyes of others , to feel free and to feel responsible , above all , not to feel lonely and isolated . The first great obstacle is the sizeof modern-communities . By-nature man seems adapted to live in communities of a very moderate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ever-enlarging ones . Many of the damaging effects of family life described by modern psychologists may be the result of our attempt to make the family group satisfy psychological needs which can only be satisfied by the community group . The family is based on inequality , the parent-child relationship ; the community is , or should be , based on equality , the relationship of free citizens . We need both . Fortunately , recent technical advances , such as cheap electrical power , are making smaller social units more of a practical possibility than they seemed fifty years ago . The second obstacle is social injustice and inequality . A man can not be a happy member of a community if he feels that community is treating him unjustly , and the more complicated and impersonal economic life becomes , the truer this is . In a small factory where employer and employees know each other personally , that is , where the conditions approximate to those of family life , the The NATION employees will accept without resentment a great deal more inequality than their fellows in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of individual wills living in association . There is no Such thing as a general will of society , except in so far as all these individual wills agree in desiring certain material things , for example , food and clothes . It is also true , perhaps , that all desire happiness and goodness , but their conceptions of these may and do conflict with one another . Ideally , government is the means by which all the individual wills are assured complete freedom of moral choice and at the same time prevented from ever clashing . Such an ideal government , of course , does not and could not ever exist . It presupposes that every individual in society possesses equal power , and also that every individual takes part in the government . In practice , the majority is always ruled by a minority , a certain number of individuals who decide what a law shall be , and who command enough force to see that the majority obeys them . Democracy assumes , I think correctly , the right of every individual to revolt against his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as successful as its advocates hoped , first , because it failed to realize the pressure that the more powerful and better-educated classes could bring to bear upon the less powerful and less well-educated in their decisions  --  it ignored the fact that in an economically unequal society votes may be equal but voters are not  --  and , secondly , because it assumed , I think quite wrongly , that voters living in the same geographical area would have the same interests , again ignoring economic differences and the change from an agricultural to an industrial economy . I believe that representation should be by trade or profession . No one person has exactly the same interests as another , but I , say as a writer in Birmingham , have more interests in common with other writers in Leeds or London than I have with my next-door neighbor who manufactures cheap jewelry . This failure of the geographical unit to correspond to a genuine political unit is one of the factors responsible for the rise of the party machine . We rarely elect a local man whom we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three persons offered from above . This seems to me thoroughly unsatisfactory . I think one of our mistakes is that we do not have enough stages in election ; a hundred , thousand voters are reduced by a single act to one man who goes to Parliament . This must inevitably mean a large degree of dictatorship from above . A sane democracy would , I feel , choose its representatives by a series of electoral stages , each lower stage electing the one above it . Legislation is a form of coercion , of limiting freedom . Coercion is necessary because societies are not free communities ; we do not choose the society into which we are December 24 , 1938 born ; we can attempt to change it , but we can not leave it . Ideally , people should be free to know evil and to choose the good , but the consequences of choosing evil are often to compel others to evil . The guiding principle of legislation in a democracy should be , not to make people good , but to prevent them from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there should be laws against theft or murder , because no one chooses to be stolen from or murdered . But it is not always so simple . It is argued by laissez faire economists that legislation concerning hours of work , wages , and so forth , violates the right of individual wills to bargain freely . But this presupposes that the bargaining powers of different wills are equal , and that each bargain is an individual act . Neither of these assumptions is true , and economic legislation is justified because they are not . But there are other forms of legislation which are less justified . It is true that the individual will operating in a series of isolated acts is an abstraction  --  our present acts are the product of past acts and in their turn determine future ones  --  but I think the law has to behave as if this abstraction were a fact ; otherwise there is no end to legislative interference . Take the case , for instance , of drink . If I become a drunkard , I may impair not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it can be argued , and often is , that the law should see that I do not become one by preventing me from purchasing alcohol . I think , however , that this is an unjustifiable extension of the law 's function . Everything I do , the hour I go to bed , the literature I read , the temperature of my bath , affects my character for good or bad and so , ultimately , the characters of those with whom I come in contact , and if the legislator is once allowed to consider the distant effects of my acts , there is no reason why he should not decide everything for me . The law has to limit itself to considering the act in isolation : if the act directly violates the will of another , the law is justified in interfering ; if only indirectly , it is not . In theory , every individual has a right to his own conception of what form society ought to take and what form of government there should be and to exercise his will to realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a right to reject his conception . In practice , this boils down to the right of different political parties to exist , parties representing the main divisions of interest in society . I do not see how in politics one can decide a priori what conduct is moral , or what degree of tolerance there should be . One can only decide which party in one 's private judgment has the best view of what society ought to be , and then support it ; and remember that since all coercion is a moral evil , we should view with extreme suspicion those who welcome it . Yet I can not see how a socialist country could tolerate the existence of a fascist party any more than a fascist country could tolerate the existence of a socialist party . Intolerance is an evil and691 has evil consequences which we can never accurately foresee and which we shall always have to suffer ; but there are occasions on which we must be prepared to accept the responsibility of our convictions . We have the misfortune or the good luck to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the whole structure of our society and its cultural and metaphysical values are undergoing a radical change . It has happened before , when the Roman Empire collapsed and at the Reformation , and it may happen again in the future . In periods of steady evolution it is possible for the common man to pursue his private life without bothering his head very much over the principles and assumptions by which he lives , and to leave politics in the hands of professionals . But ours is not such an age . It is idle to lament that the world is becoming divided into hostile ideological camps ; the division is a fact . No policy of isolation is possible . Democracy , liberty , justice , and reason are being seriously threatened and , in many parts of the world , destroyed . It is the duty of every one of us , not only to ourselves but to future generations of men , to have a clear understanding of what we mean when we use these words , and to defend what we believe to be right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
