( See Cover ) <P> For five humid May days in 1928 a group of shirtsleeved men stayed in a smoke-fogged suite in Manhattan 's Ritz-Carlton Hotel , bargaining , eating , occasionally sleeping . Clarence Dillon wanted to sell the automobile company bought four years before by Dillon , Read &; Co. from the widows of Motormakers John and Horace Dodge . Walter P. Chrysler , as expert a machinist as ever stood at a lathe , as smart a trader as ever swapped a horse , wanted to buy it . <P> By the end of the fifth day the fat was in the fire . Onetime roundhouse sweeper Walter Chrysler , who had left the presidency of Buick ( $500,000 a year ) to retire at 44 from an industry that would n't let him quit , who had later founded blazing Chrysler Corp . on the ashes of the dying Maxwell-Chalmers fire , had agreed to buy Dodge . The price suited Walter Chrysler , right down to the ground : $170,000,000 in new Chrysler stock . Without turning over a penny of cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forge and foundry facilities it needed to drive from No. 5 in the industry to the No. 2 position it holds today . ( No. 1 , General Motors : No. 3 , Ford . ) <P> Two months later Dodge stockholders had assented to the deal and the contract was signed . Next morning Broker Dillon dropped in to see Motorman Chrysler at his office on Madison Avenue to find out when Chrysler would begin operating Dodge . " Hell , Clarence , " replied Walter , " our boys moved in last night . " <P> Boss of the boys that moved in that night ( carrying canvas signs : CHRYSLER CORPORATION , DODGE DIVISION ) was the husky , jut-jawed Chrysler general manager whom Walter Chrysler described to his biographer , Boyden Sparkes , as " a great production man . " That night at Detroit " K. T. " had stayed close to the phone and when Walter Chrysler called from New York ( " We 've bought the Dodge-put up your signs " ) he knew what to do . Within a year he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the machine-shop where he had worked as a horny-handed mechanic , were driving Chrysler spectacularly into then motor 's Big Three . <P> Ailing for more than a year , Walter P. Chrysler sat last week at his home on the shore of Long Island 's Little Neck Bay . Not for months had he been seen around the docks where in days of health he loved to tinker at his motorboat engines with his derby awry and his white shirt rumpling up under his suspenders . Not for more than a year had his quick laugh been heard in any of the 24 Chrysler plants . His friends feared that Board Chairman Walter Chrysler , burned out at 64 by the gruelling drive from the roundhouse to a paneled office , would never mix in motor 's hurly-burly again . <P> But in his impetuous , romantic rise from the little West Kansas town where he was raised , son of a crack Union Pacific railroad engineer , Walter Chrysler had done something more than pull himself up by his bootstraps . Like most other successful U. S. businessmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he was sick and out of the game , no Chrysler stockholder suffered .
