txt Statistically speaking , says Paul Popenoe of the Los Angeles Institute of Family Relations , there are " very few " bachelors over 15 " who are yet worth marrying . " " The single males of 55 and up , " he explains further , " comprise a preponderance of mental and physical defectives or men whose outlook is so warped , so infantile or egocentric that even the most optimistic maiden , willing to marry a man to reform him , would recognize this particular job as hopeless . " Popenoc 's advice was presented before the American Eugenics society today by A. E. W'iggam of New York . Popenoe 's contention . is that just about all marriageable men are in the age group under thirty-five ; just about all of them are marrying women one jog farther down the age ladder than they are , and that therefore the high type , best educated women fail to marry , making one of the most serious problems of eugenics . As for the home girl hopeful of picking a husband , Popenoe says she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Yale university , reelected president of the society , presented a two point program for improving the human race : 1 Making it as easy as possible not to have children , and 2 making it as easy as possible to have children by society assuring to parents no lowering of living standards .
