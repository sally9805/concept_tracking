TO GET from New York to California by air costs Imo . By rail it costs $112 . By one of those gigantic transcontinental busses in which the passengers stare at Pennsylvania , Illinois , and Arizona , and sleep as best they can ( in the leather " reclining seats " ) through Ohio , Kansas , and New Mexico , it costs $58 . First- , second- , and third-class travel , American style . Not much room , you may say , for a fourth class . Yet there is a fourth class , and its rise , operation , and vitality are among the strangest phenomena of American civilization , post-boom model . Somewhere in the deserts beyond the Colorado River a Lincoln sedan is bowling along route No. 66 at fifty-five miles an hour . There are four people in the car aside from the driver ? a young man with a college necktie , an elderly waiter out of a job , a schoolmarm of thirty-three , and a fat , comfortable , motherly soul who has told everyone , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her son is the greatest second-assistant soundtrack man in all Hollywood . These passengers are pleased with life . They will be in Los Angeles that night , they have seen a lot of country , and they are on very friendly terms for people who , a week before in New York , were total strangers . But what pleases them most of all is the fact that , deducting one dollar a night in tourist inns and not much more per day for meals , this **27;1168;TOOLONG from coast to coast in a beautiful car with soft seats and luxurious springs has cost each of them exactly thirty-five dollars . Yet their pleasure is nothing compared with that of the owner of the car , a small manufacturer who has retired upon a dwindling income , and who calculates ( while his hands jiggle the steering wheel just enough to keep it on the road ) that this trip , minus gas , oil , board , lodging , and postcards , minus that blowout at Kansas City , minus the twenty per cent commission paid to the travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing at all but has left him the richer by ninety dollars in cold cash . This is a picture of the brighter side of America 's fourth class , share-expense travel . There is , unfortunately , another side . A personal maid of Irish extraction , a dispirited bond salesman , a third-rate auction-bridge expert , and the wife of a tiling and mosaic contractor are whizzing through the enchantments of industrial New Jersey in a Cadillac Imperial de luxe . Each has paid nineteen dollars to get from Broadway to Miami , which is n't bad , considering that the train fare is thirty dollars more . They are hungry ; they tell the driver to stop at a nice looking cafeteria in Camden . The driver is a personable fellow with a small black mustache and flashing eyes . In the cafeteria they pick up bundles of table silver wrapped in paper napkins and sit down . " Well , folks , " says FOURTH-CLASS TRAVEL , AMERICAN STYLE 367 the driver , " I sure could eat something myself , but I guess I 'll take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give that carburetor the once over ? ' The passengers agree that it is kind of him to think of them first , and plunge into the vegetable soup . When they are half way through their pie they begin to hope nothing 's really wrong with the carburetor . Fifteen minutes later the driver is still absent . A vague fear begins to spoil their digestions . An hour later , having searched every garage in town , they notify a policeman , who explains very kindly that they are victims of the latest addition to America 's large collection of rackets . The personable driver , having collected his fares to Miami in advance , has quietly disappeared . A racket on its outer fringes ? yes ; but the share-expense method of travel is also a growing business and a convenience that fulfills the American demand for travel , for companionship , and for economy . Three years ago almost unknown , to-day it is rapidly developing into an institution . Three years ago one could see , hidden in the personal column of the want advertisements , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay their share of the gas and oil to anyone who would take them from New Orleans to Chattanooga . Then came the crash . Thousands of respectable Americans found themselves without a job in cities far from home . Hundreds of automobile owners found themselves with an empty and expensive car , a desire to go somewhere else , and no money to do it on . Gradually these individual units of supply and demand learned of one another 's existence , at first through their own advertisements , then through middlemen who brought them together and collected a fee . Later the middlemen went a step farther and began hiring cars andchauffeurs to run on regular routes . Some of the chauffeurs dumped their passengers by the wayside or even relieved them of their valuables . Complaints poured in , and angry travelers returned , on foot or by train , to the starting point , only to find that the middleman disclaimed responsibility or had disappeared . Newspapers began to investigate " travel bureau " and " share-expense " advertisements , and in some cases required a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack from the poverty-stricken railroads , began to notice the competition of an even cheaper system of transportation than their own , and howled about unfair practices . But to the American public anything seems fair that works , and the share-expense plan of travel works well , for it is pleasant and profitable to all concerned . The bus companies may secure legislation , the automobile associations may pass resolutions denouncing it as a great national evil , the newspapers may scrutinize and limit its advertising , but at most they will drive a number of the gyps and racketeers to cover , leaving the field to the legitimate middlemen and those car owners who honestly intend to take you to Chicago for thirteen dollars as promised . We are witnessing the inevitable development of a vast " underground " railroad which is transporting , every year , some hundreds of thousands of people , and will continue to do so , and to transport more and more of them , so long as money in this republic remains more important than time . Like so many other American businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Reliable Young Man . He had come to Florida for his slice of prosperity , and when some of it accidentally got into his pocket he bought a car . The boom wilted , mortgages crashed one on top of another , and it occurred to the young man , just a little too late , that he had better go back home if he wanted to eat . Of course , American that he was , he could not bear to part with that shiny , balloon-tired car ; so he took half of his remaining three dollars and forty cents to the local newspaper , which duly announced , in very small type , that a Reliable Young Man would drive Parties to Milwaukee or Vicinity for Share Expenses . Several real estate victims turned up at his boarding house , looked him in the eye , glanced at his operator 's license and the lodge card entitling him to Christian burial at the expense of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks , and gave him five dollars apiece ; and the next day they were off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whether they ever got to Milwaukee is not recorded . Simultaneously , and by thousands , other more or less reliable Americans conceived the same bright idea . And in time , and by hundreds , citizens with sharp eyes and ears to the ground conceived the even brighter idea of making money by bringing together the carless passengers and the passengerless cars . And so to-day in New York and the other large cities you can walk up to a man behind a desk ? in his own office , but more often in a hotel lobby andsay that you want to go to Montreal ( $7 ) or St. Petersburg ( $21 ) or Reno ( $38 ) or Fort Wayne ( $12 ) , and he will collect a small deposit and tell you to come back Tuesday at nine-thirty with not more than one valise . And if you show curiosity and he is talkative , he will tell you that last year he sent a thousand people to Florida , that to-day he has cars going out to Chicago , to Chattanooga , to Savannah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that heguarantees that you will get there , and that he will pay bus fare from any point where the unknown car breaks down ; that you will travel three hundred and fifty miles a day , and can sleep cleanly and comfortably in tourist inns for a dollar or even seventy-five cents a night ; that you may take out five thousand dollars ' worth of travelers ' insurance for a quarter ( though he does not tell you that if you are smashed up the insurance company will pay you much less than if you were the victim of a common carrier ) ; that your fellow-passengers are respectable people who wo n't eat garlic or talk your arm off ; that you will pay the driver , not a lump sum , but a daily pro rata fraction of the total ; that the driver , like the captain of a ship at sea , is boss but is open to suggestion from those who want to take photographs , pick flowers , or detour to the Grand Canyon ; that the car is a 1931 Packard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be careful not to break your neck ; and that the racial antecedents , financial standing , and personal references of said owner have been investigated and found to be absolutely first class . All of this in the case of the very few established and reputable share-expense " Travel for a Trifle " bureaus is quite true . There are risks , to be sure , the risks of boredom as well as of disaster , even under the best auspices ; but Americans are hardy travelers and unafraid of their fellow-men . And those of us ? a pathetic minority ? who are not children of the automobile age and would not willingly suffer intense mileage on bleak highways in the constant company of total strangers must remember the fascination that just plain road , and lots of it , has for the average American ; the drugged , comatose joy which is his when the road is straight , and concrete , and the tires not too full of air . Of course the chief appeal of the share-expense travel is low cost , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , with spontaneous ingenuity , a new subcellar below the supposedly rock-bottom prices of the transcontinental bus . This would not , perhaps , have happened but for the depression and the stern necessity for the unemployed and stranded of getting back to where they came from , or where they may find a job . But even when that second edition of Heaven appears around the turn of the next corner , when stocks go up and bread lines shorten and pay envelopes bulge again , the share-expense system of travel will shrink , perhaps , but it will not die . Though most of its passengers are mechanics , and jobless salesmen , and merged executives , and those who were dropped into the cracks left by the financial earthquake , there are others who choose this way of traveling not only because it is cheap but because they like it . They like the sense of freedom , the deep cushioned seats , the endless variety of scenery and filling-station architecture , the accidental intimacies . Young girls traveling alone can feel safe ( if the travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find someone to talk to . The roof of a sedan is somehow friendlier than that of a train . One travel bureau reports that it sells transportation to a great many teachers and students anxious to see the world , to Europeans , and to Soviet technicians and engineers who are not only somewhat impoverished by the rouble but also eager to experience in person the pleasures provided by that minor deity of Soviet Russia , the American automobile . Women are frequent travelers on this underground railroad , and among them are large numbers of women with dogs , for the share-expense sedan admits dogs if they are not too big , while the bus companies will not allow them . Sometimes the contacts made in the course of one of these transcontinental trips are permanent . Two young men who had never seen each other when they started from New York went into partnership together when they reached the Coast . And Cupid is also an occasional passenger ? a couple who were strangers when they started were married soon after they got to Los Angeles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though that may develop as a profitable sideline . For the moment they are interested in immediate cash profits , which is why so many of them should not be too completely trusted . And Like all pioneers in a new field , the majority of them are financially flimsy and morally irresponsible . They flit from place to place . They enjoy the hospitality of a small hotel lobby until there is a complaint , when they gather up their cheaply printed folders and their lists of gypsy car owners and move somewhere else , or into another line of business founded on the high birthrate of suckers . Sometimes there is no office at all , but only a glib adventurer who stands all day at street corners soliciting passers-by . One of these free lance professionals makes his headquarters on the sidewalks of Times Square , New York . Last year he made eighteen round trips , each with five passengers , between New York and San Francisco . He pays no brokerage fee , so his net profit , allowing for oil and gasoline , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a back man these days . And if one walks west in New York 's dingy and sinister Forties , one will find , almost at the waterfront , a malevolent looking parking space , where a smooth-spoken young man , as he dusts off a road-scarred Buick , promises to get one to the Coast for less than thirty-five dollars , transferring at Chicago , whence , he says , one continues west in unused , out-dated models which overstocked dealers are sending to be sold in California . These cars take only three passengers , for fear of hurting the upholstery and scratching the paint . III In a small hotel on New York 's West Side the proprietor shook his head sadly . Yes , there had been a travel bureau man ( who called himself the " National Travel Service " ) operating there only the week before . But he had skipped , owing the hotel sixty dollars . He had also taken two rented typewriters with him . In addition , he was wanted by the police for collecting twenty-five dollars apiece for uniforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for smuggling aliens . All he had left behind were a few letters ? from a young woman upstate who inquired if it was safe to go alone to Florida , from the owner of a Whippet coach ( " it runs fine " ) who would " carry either male or female or both " to Miami , and one , unmailed , from the crook himself to his partner in Chicago : " Well old man I gone ahead with the plans to engage the drivers as was outlined I had two detectives in from the police department who questioned me . . . . Of course you can not blame anyone for making an investigation of the method you instructed me to employ , as this no doubt could be worked as a healthy racket . " And so it could be worked , and is . But the racket is not very healthy for the credulous passengers who , in a large number of cases , have been dumped , slugged , or robbed . A list of major and minor crimes that haveresulted from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impossible to compile , for they are scattered all over the forty-eight States , and the victims are often ashamed to complain of having been fleeced . But a few well authenticated instances will give an idea of the varieties of this new racket , if not of its extent . In New York there was once an agency , happily defunct , which operated six second-hand Lincoln sedans . According to its sales literature , the public had nothing to fear . The driver , it was inferred , owned the car himself , was supposedly driving to California just for his health , and was apparently bonded for five hundred dollars . When the car was filled , and after the passengers had paid in their full fares , the driver would head for one of the smaller New York upstate towns . Upon arrival he would suggest that to save time he would take the car to a garage for minor repairs while they were eating lunch . Let the baggage stay in the car ? he would look out for it . And he did ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the passengers finished their lunch the driver , baggage and all , with a new set of license plates , was roaring back three wealthy but thrifty Greeks . For a long time they had planned a trip to the fabled wonders of Hollywood . But they never could make up their minds to jump the first barrier , which was the railroad fare . At last they were persuaded by the literature and the low price of a share-expense agency ( the same one that operated the six Lincoln sedans ) . Before starting they invested part of what they had saved in railroad fare in gay and dazzling clothes ? the better to impress Constance Bennett , Greta Garbo , and the other goddesses they expected to FOURTH-CLASS TRAVEL , AMERICAN STYLE 371 meet at the far end of the trip . And they took along nice fat bankrolls ? those movie dames always tumble for the dough . They made the mistake of boasting to the driver of the car about all the parties they were going to have with these dames . The driver laughed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two . In a lonely meadow just outside the city the driver stopped the car , took out a pistol , and drove off with their fares , their bankrolls , their bags , their warm topcoats , and their brand new hats . But the driver was n't a poor sport ? he left the three Greeks just enough for bus fare to get back to town . Another equally sad , but more curious story : An elderly woman , of the popular magazine grandmother type , placed an advertisement in a metropolitan newspaper offering to share expenses with any " nice " party driving to Jacksonville . Two flashy young men turned up . They were waiters , it seemed ; they had just secured jobs in a Florida hotel , and they had a new Buick . They were so polite , so well dressed , and so eager to have her as a passenger on a comfortable , pleasant journey that she did n't even ask for references before she paid them fifteen dollars for her share . She went farther ? she contributed a basket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her , but the nice young men would n't touch it . On the contrary , they took her to a roadhouse and bought her a lunch the check for which was more than her passage money . That evening she was again their guest at a roadhouse . The next day they mentioned that their funds were low . Would n't they , the old lady asked , please let her help them out ? Oh , no thanks ; they expected to pick up some cash from a friend not far away . The friend turned out to be an unsuspecting filling station , which the two young men held up and cleaned out in first-rate Chicago style . They repeated this exploit twice before they got to Jacksonville . After one of those raids the police chased them for miles and fired many times at the fleeing Buick while the dear old soul , amazed and terrified , sat on the floor of the tonneau to avoid being shot . Aside from these holdups , the young brigands behaved very well and were perfect hosts to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that after it was all over and she had recovered from the shock , the old lady said that she " just did n't have the heart to turn them over to the police , " but that she was certainly " going to complain to the newspaper in which she placed her advertisement for introducing her to such reckless young men . " Two girls who thought it would be fun to take a share-expense vacation in Canada suffered a nasty automobile accident at the hands of some young men supplied by the travel bureau , were fiendishly maltreated into the bargain , and spent weeks in a hospital . But this is an extreme case . As a rule women travelers feel safer with a man driving than with another woman . More often the men will treat the women to meals and hotel hills on the way , though occasionally they " get fresh . " One young man who did so was well rewarded . While he stopped to buy some cigarettes , the offended lady slid into the driver 's seat . went into first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a murder . The automobile clubs and associations to whose ears have come more or less lurid tales of the perils of share-expense travel are up in arms , and publicly advise all those who want to get from place to place cheaply to try some more public method . The risks , they say , are too great , the safeguards almost nil , and the honest travel bureaus too few . They point out that even if the passenger is not fleeced and comes unharmed to his destination there are dangers in the commercialization of private supply and demand , and chances for dishonest profit in the bringing of " guest suits . " The " guest suit " is becoming more common and reaching the proportions of a racket . Those who travel in someone else 's car and contribute toward its expenses are legally " guests , " and if injured of course bring suit . If the sedan in which Mr. Jones is taking those friendly strangers to Jacksonville goes over a bad hole in the road and one of those " guests " bumps his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And if he wins , he is equally likely to find that Mr. Jones , though the owner of a car , has no money with which to meet the judgment . The better newspapers , which at first were a willing meeting ground for cars and passengers , and helped to build up the racket by accepting practically any advertisements , are also alarmed at the irresponsibility of those who thrive on their want advertisements , and are taking steps to make life more difficult for the chiselers , the fly-by-nights , and the pirates . The New York Times recently tried to have these travel bureaus form an organization . A meeting was held in its offices , and got as far as to elect a chairman . But when the next meeting was held the chairman had vanished and was reported to have gone to California ? perhaps to avoid threats against his liberty or his health . IV It will probably not be long before all the newspapers which care something about their readers ' welfare will lay down strict rules for those who wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The advertiser 's record will be looked up , he will be required to post a five hundred dollar bond , to assume responsibility for the condition of the cars he scuds out , to guarantee to the passengers arrival at their destination , and to pay the rest of the way if the cars break down , to issue no tickets to them unless they have taken out accident insurance , and to he sure of the character and responsibility of the drivers and perhaps of the passengers as well . When these rules are generally in force a great many of the so-called travel bureaus will vanish . They could not possibly scrape up five hundred dollars for a bond . Of course a great many of the fly-by-nights will manage to keep alive even if the public becomes more cautious and the newspapers manage to put a brake on irresponsible advertisers . But were the underground railroad to become no matter how respectable and free of crooks and of the rat-faced descendants of the old-time road agent , it would still be largely illegal and an object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let us pause for a moment to consider the bus companies , and pity them . They are one of the most astounding mushrooms of the postwar period . From feeble , scattered ventures crawling between neighboring cities , they have grown into a national institution . Their great rolling dormitories , painted gray and blue and cream white , lettered with the names of all the big American cities , roar across the continent , by day terrifying the peaceful Ford driver into the ditch , by night illuminating level miles of deserted concrete with headlights like the eyes of prehistoric animals . And by millions their frugal passengers bump and doze from coast to coast , and look out with white apathetic faces upon a reeling vision of endless corn fields , wide prairies , hot dog stands , filling stations , and outdoor advertisements . Upon the map , the net-work traveled by the busses is almost as great a spider web as that spun by the railroads ? a fact of which the railroads are sorrowfully aware . Pity the railroads : the busses have cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacked in legislatures by the railroads , they are forced to pay heavy taxes for the highways they travel on ; having gained some degree of stability , they are now viewing with horror the inroads of a cheaper traffic than their own , a more secret and impalpable traffic , upon which it is very difficult to fasten the brakes of law and economic pressure . The bus companies , which have achieved a melancholy expertness in such matters , point out that the laws which have forced them to decorate their vehicles with the license plates of each and every State through which they carry passengers , should in equal measure apply to the private sedans and coaches of the share-expense plan . Life is hard enough , say the busses , without these fly-by-night fellows coming along and stealing legitimate trade and indulging in unfair competition and cutting fares and whizzing through just as many States without paying a nickel for a license plate . A man who accepts twenty dollars from you ( the bus fare is thirty-three ) and transports you from Broadway to Miami in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is he not ? Or at any rate for profit ? Then he ought to pay the legal fee for such a service in each State where he performs it . In other words , he should plaster his car with the license plates of New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Maryland , Delaware , Virginia , North and South Carolina , Georgia , and Florida , or a total of some $190 , or a grand total ? since he should also take out thepersonal license of an operator for hire in each case ? of $i12.50 . The bus companies may succeed in tying the share-expense driver up with even more legal red tape than theoretically threatens him now , but they wo n't catch him . If the police stop him ( and in Georgia they do occasionally manage to stop him and collect a license fee ) , he can explain that he and his wife and his nephew and his cousin Bill are going where the sun shines , and the passengers will cheerfully assume the relationship to save him money . The only comfort that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent of this semiprivate competition is probably too high . Nobody knows how many Americans from one January to another " share expenses , " but a guess that it is not five per cent of the bus traffic , and that many of the share-expense travelers , if they had to travel by bus or rail , would not travel at all , is as good a guess as any other . And while we are guessing , let us register the prophecy that this new racket , or unfair competition , or answer to the world 's lack of dollars , or comfortable and ingenious device for seeing the country , is here to stay . The automobile dealers , for one thing , will hardly discourage it ? for it keeps cars rolling that might be turned in or sold , and in its small measure stimulates the sale of new ones by giving owners a chance to recoup on their investment . More important , the public , which now hardly knows of its existence , will learn its ropes and its advantages , and steadily increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gyps can be run to cover , that demand will be met by a constantly more efficient and more reliable supply . To-day , as happened yesterday and will happen even more frequently to-morrow , the proud but impecunious owners of eight-cylinder sedans will tighten bolts and fill gas tanks and smilingly do agreeable little sums on the corners of road maps ; and assistant professors and ladies with lapdogs and middle-aged men homesick for California will close suitcases and mentally subtract share-expense fare from bus or railroad fare and wait for the toot of a horn ; and then the passengers and the driver will eye one another suspiciously and say " pleased to meet you , " and later they will all be exchanging views on prohibition , and four days after that they will be calling one another by first names , and at the end of the trip the driver will shake hands all around and deposit a neat roll of bills in the bank , and the passengers will go to bed in a strange hotel and close their eyes , partly from fatigue , partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ? which was a good deal nearer one cent than two cents a mile .
