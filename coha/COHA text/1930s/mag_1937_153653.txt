Well aware of the filth , crime and disease spawned in New York City 's sprawling slums , Manhattan 's square-headed Robert Ferdinand Wagner proposed a bill two years ago seeking to eliminate such surroundings . The embryonic law died in the Senate Education and Labor Committee . Last year Senator Wagner 's seasoned measure passed the Senate with little debate but Congress adjourned before the House could consider it . <P> Fortnight ago , Bob Wagner 's veteran slum-clearing measure came to bat for the third time . Backed by such assorted powers as President Roosevelt , the conservative New York Times and the tory New York Herald Tribune , the bill looked like a sure thing . Sponsor Wagner crowed : " There is practical unanimity throughout the country in favor of the measure . . . . There was practically no opposition to the bill in the hearings before the committee . " <P> His Housing Bill , 1937 edition , was modeled closely after a popular British slum-clearing act . It provided for $700,000,000 to be loaned by the Federal Government to a U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erecting low-rental dwellings in their stead . The Authority would then reimburse the Treasury by selling their own 60-year bonds ( guaranteed by the U. S. ) to the public . If income from the necessarily low rents fell short of paying off bonds &; interest , the Government would chip in up to $20,000,000 a year-an outright subsidy , but a trifle compared to the cost of other Federal efforts to aid the underprivileged . Only tenants qualifying for the new houses would be the rock-bottom 15% of the lower third which President Roosevelt has labeled " ill-housed , ill-clothed , ill-fed " - about 175,000 families earning some $50 a month and paying about $5 rent per room . <P> From the start Bob Wagner was worried about only one thing : how much damage would the Senate do to his bill before finally passing it ? He had been on his feet less than an hour when sniping began . George of Georgia wanted to know what was in it for the farmers . Bob Wagner , instead of appealing to rural magnanimity , claimed that his bill benefited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bill as " a fraud because it can not be administered in rural areas . " Snapped Senator Wagner : " I 'll compare my character with that of the Senator from Georgia . " <P> In spite of such wrangling Majority Leader Barkley predicted passage of the bill by the middle of the second day of debate . At the end of the fifth day Senators wearily voted , 64-to-16 , for a Housing Bill gutted by conservative amendments . Anti-Administrationist Harry Byrd called attention to Resettlement Administration 's Greenbelt in Maryland , which cost $16,000 per family unit , and Hightstown Project in New Jersey ( $20,000 per unit ) . Then he demanded a construction limit of $4,000 per family unit and $1,000 per room . " A spokesman for the Administration , " he cried , " said . . . that this was an experiment , and that all experiments were costly . . . . Why , may I ask , is the building of a house an experiment ? People have built houses from the beginning of time . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
