MAGNOLIA STREET - Louis Golding - Farrar &; Rinehart ( $2.50 ) . * <P> Great oaks from little acorns grow , but great novels seldom grow from small potatoes . Latest literatus to attempt this particular impossibility is Author Golding who plants his small potatoes in neat rows on either side Magnolia Street . One row is Christian , one Jewish . Though each keeps its sprouting and blossoming pretty much to itself , the vines get tangled every now &; then . <P> The most amiable entanglement takes place between Rose Berman. a Jewess , and John Cooper , a gentile sailor boy who loves her on leave and off . Their affair scandalizes the Jewish section , who act as self-appointed sympathizers with Rose 's invalid mother . Rose runs off to London , consummates her love for Cooper there . A telegram that her mother is dying brings her back to Magnolia Street in a hurry ; but after her mother 's death she marries Cooper , goes off to live with him elsewhere . <P> Among the hundred-odd fairly odd characters who live through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the least forgettable are : Mrs. Tregunter who lives on weak tea , lettuce leaves and hatred of the Jews ; Rabbi Shulman who has the Talmud on the brain ; Benny Edelman whose rescue of Tommie Wright from drowning induces Philanthropist Emmanuel to give a Magnolia Street party , which brings the Jews and gentiles together temporarily . But Mrs. Wright sees Benny naked after the rescue ; their subsequent marriage cuts Benny off from his Jewish family for good . <P> During the War everybody has his troubles , great &; small , except Mr. Winburg the tailor , who makes a fortune selling shoddy raincoats . It is his daughter Bella , in whose bath salts are all the perfumes of Arabia , who gives the second , concluding Magnolia Street party , which brings Jews and gentiles together again . By this time , in spite of Author Golding 's sincere and humane labors , the reader is likely to be wishing both Jews and gentiles either dead or living without such tedious detail . <P> The Author .
