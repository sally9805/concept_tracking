txt DODGERS ' UNIQUE SYSTEM By 1938 They Will Pay Managers for Not Working at All , Is Claim . To SpOrtS Editor of The New York Times : Uncle Robbie won two pennants under the late Charles Ebbets and came close to taking another in 1930 under the mixed business management of the Brooklyn club that has obtained since Ebbets died . Uncle Robbie was fired . Max Carey brought the Dodgers to one finish in third place , and Max was fired . Casey Stengel could n't get ' em out of the second division and Casey was fired . Robbie received $10,000 when he left , Carey was paid a year 's salary and Stengel must be paid off for 1937 at the rate of $15,500 . If the system follows through Burleigh Grimes will be manager for only half a season and be paid for not working the remaining half . What I 'd like now is a tip on how to be appointed the Dodgers ' manager for 1938 , when I could draw a year 's pay without any managing at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1936 . Editorial Note : This way , please . The line forms on the left .
