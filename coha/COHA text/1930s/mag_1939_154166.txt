Little scientific work has been done on the " language " of animals . Partly because most animals are not very gabby , partly because they are shy , until lately the only available collections of animal noises have been the dubious data supplied by bird-and-barnyard imitators . <P> In London recently a book was published which went a long way toward filling the gap. * Written by Popularizer-Professor Julian Sorell Huxley , and containing two discs ( four sides ) recorded by Ludwig Koch , the book shows that a greater variety of animal sounds exists than most scientists ever suspected . <P> To get his records Koch needed patience , ingenuity and a complicated apparatus . For a year an enormous van had to be moved back &; forth between two big British zoos to catch the llama 's hollow mating cry , the spotted hyena 's angry laugh , the binturong 's exhibitionist catcall . Koch spent some sleepless nights . <P> He recorded not only exotic sounds which the average zoo-goer never hears in a hundred visits but also such familiar noises as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harsh , discordant barks , which sound like a few bars from Ravel 's Valse . More sophisticated listeners preferred the grotesque beauty of the West African red river hog 's grunt , the resonant , whuffing snort of the white-tailed gnu , the whistling whinny of the panda . <P> Most of this animal language has a surprising range . The lion alone makes six distinct sounds , all the way from a hunting call to a grumble of satisfaction after the kill , when it roars " as gently as any sucking dove .
