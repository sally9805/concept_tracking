txt Contrasted with generally poor results In 1935 , cane refiners this year stand an excellent chance of showing substantial earnings . Leading processors started the year in a strong inventory position , and have been aggressive sellers of refined sugar , enjoying a rising market and a good profit margin . American Sugar Refining Co. , leading cane refiner , had a gratifying first six months , unofficial estimates indicating about $3 a share for the period . The company could easily show $5 a share or better for the year , if conditions continue favorable . Operating in one of the poorest twelve months In its history , the company last year earned only 93 cents ? share on the common . To attain a showing of $5 a share , American Sugar would have to earn only $1.50 a share on refining operations during 1936 , making possible considerable expansion of earning power if given favorable conditions in the final months of the year . Income From Investments Income from investments In Cuban properties producing raw sugar , and holdings in National Sugar Refining Co. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other investments , should run well over $3 a share on the 950,000 shares of common . Absence of profits on refining operations last year absorbed a good part of the income from investments . The sugar trade has estimated that leading refiners have depleted stocks to a point where supplies and commitments on the basis of present meltings , are only enough to last eight weeks at the outside , indicating a resumption of a broad raw buying movement by refiners shortly . Resting on their favorable inventory position established early this year , refiners have been practically out of the market for several months . In an industry contending with price cutting and rebates , particularly since the Sugar Institute was stopped of its major functions by Federal Court ruling two weeks ago . operation of the Robinson-Patman law should have a very helpful effect . The Sugar Institute was organized years ago as a trade organization to function against price-cutting and rebating . With its strong working capital position , and no funded debt , American Sugar Refining Co. should be a likely candidate for upward revision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are borne out for the year . The company has 450,000 shares each of common and preferred stock outstanding . The $2 annual common dividend has been in effect since July , 1932 , when the rate was reduced . A. $5 annual rate was in effect in 1931 . Little attention has been paid to the company 's interest in allied fields from which substantial income is received . For instance , American Sugar Refining Co. has a 25% interest , or 145,732 shares yielding annual dividends around $290,000 , in National Sugar Refining Co . The company owns 25% of the stock of Michigan Sugar Co. and 50% of the stock of the Spreckels Sugar Co. , a closed corporation operating in California on which little data is available . In 1934 , American Sugar Refining Co. received $300,000 from the investment in Spreckels Sugar . Spreckels last year made over 2,000,000 bags of sugar . With excellent crop conditions in California this year , it is probable the company will increase output 25% . Cuban holdings in raw sugar producing properties are represented by an investment now carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most modern properties are comprised in Central Canagua and Jaronu . These properties operated at a loss in 1934 , but with the improvement in Cuba 's position in the sugar markets , they earned $792,013 in 1935 . These earnings in recent years have been consolidated with those of the parent company . It is logical to assume that they should show a profit this year at least comparable with that of 1935 . American Sugar Refining Co. , for the year ended December 31 , 1935 , reported a net profit of $3,570,930 , after charging $1,650,000 against depreciation . Included in the net income was $877,162 of " other income " from investments . and $792,000 income from the Cuban properties . Assuming the Cuban properties show a return equal to that of last year , plus " other income " in excess of $850,000 , American Sugar Refining Co. this year thus could account for above $1,500,000 , as income other than from refining operations , or $3.50 a share on the 450,000 common shares outstanding .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
