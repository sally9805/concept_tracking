THE GREEN FOOL-Patrick Kavanagh - Harper ( $3 ) . <P> CALL MY BROTHER BACK-Michael McLaverty-Longmans , Green ( $2 ) . <P> The bragh days of the Irish Literary Renaissance were as exciting as plum cake - full of such plums as Yeats , A. E. , Joyce , J. M. Synge . For some time now the cake has been stale and almost plumless . Last week , however , Irish-hungry readers might bite into two fairly fruity bits . <P> Call My Brother Back , an autobiographical novel , starts off well with an account of a boyhood among the Ulster farmers and fishermen on Rathlin Island , peters out into unimaginative writing , although the last two-thirds of the story is laid in Belfast during the tense days of " the Trouble . " For adult readers , the book will taste more like a piece of citron than a plum . <P> On the other hand , The Green Fool , the autobiography of a sort of Irish Jesse Stuart , is one of the most plum-Irish volumes in a month of Sundays . Born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) , County Monaghan , Patrick Kavanagh was " a bit of a lazybones , a bit of a liar and a bit of a rogue . " He quit school at 12 , worked on farms , joined the Irish Republican Army , learned poaching and desultory banditry , went to all the weddings , wakes , funerals , became highly learned in Mucker legend , superstitions , gossip , cunning . <P> A brawny lad of 20 before he heard there were any good living poets in Ireland , he published his first poems shortly after in the Irish Statesman , made a pilgrimage to Dublin . Tramping back to Mucker pronouncing the Irish gods and heroes dead , the fairies driven underground , Poet Kavanagh concluded : " Writers leave Ireland because sentimental praise , or hysterical pietarian dispraise , is no use in the mouth of a hungry man .
