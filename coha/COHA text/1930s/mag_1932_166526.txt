Fascists beat Communists in the Prussian Diet last week , 162 to 57 . It was not a vote but a fight . The Diet adjourned immediately for redecoration and extensive repairs . <P> It started fairly quietly with a debate on the administration of justice in Prussia and the election of Hitlerite Hans Kerrl ( who likes to refer to Adolf Hitler as " Germany 's Jesus Christ " ) as President of the Diet . Suddenly up sprang Communist Wilhelm Pieck . Shaking his fist at the Fascist benches he screamed : " In your ranks there sit a huge number of murderers ! " <P> That was all that was needed . Spitting on their hands , the Fascists moved in . Somebody threw a chair which knocked out a Communist . Somebody else slashed the face of neutral Social Democrat Jurgensen . Inkwells , water bottles , desk drawers , chairs , ledgers , broken table legs went into the fray . Neutral deputies fled for their lives , others marooned on the speakers ' dais spent a frantic quarter of an hour ducking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 3 to 1 , the Fascists soon drove the last Communist from the Chamber , spent the next half-hour triumphantly roaring old war songs . Prince August Wilhelm von Hohenzollern , now a Fascist Deputy , placidly watched the riot , prudently threw no inkwells . <P> It was the worst brawl Prussia 's rowdy legislature has ever seen , but violence did not stop with the Deputies . As soon as the story leaked out , Communists and Hitlerites began punching each others ' noses all over Germany . In Hamburg a mob of Communists swept down the street shouting " Hunger , Hunger ! " breaking into a delicatessen store . A volley of police bullets stopped them . In Berlin a group of Hitlerites were trapped by a surly crowd in a railway tunnel , had to be rescued by police . In Cologne and at Remscheid Communist crowds did not wait to be charged , attacked the police first . At Dusseldorf the police were bombarded with crockery and potted geraniums . In Berlin a Communist crowd toured the West End , smashed windows of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens had had an all too graphic picture of the parliamentary proceedings of both of Germany 's extreme parties in action . Chancellor Brning was not unduly alarmed . Next day was Corpus Christi . He marched in the religious procession ( first in Berlin since the War ) to the Cathedral of St. Hedwig . Strengthened by this , he buttonholed President von Hindenburg for four hours and 45 minutes three days later , tried to persuade his old patron not to admit the Fascists to a share in the Government until after the Lausanne conference in June . Meanwhile , the Chancellor planned a new legislative program to break up big Junkers ' estates to provide homes for the jobless and to increase taxes by another emergency decree . <P> For President von Hindenburg this was too much . Under the influence of a group of German generals who have been intriguing against Chancellor Brning for months , he decided against him and abruptly forced the resignation of his Cabinet . While the President cast about for a new protg whom he might make Chancellor , Herr Brning was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
