Last week in honor of Mother 's Day , Secretary of War Woodring urged every U. S. soldier to write a letter to his mother . Mrs. Franklin Roosevelt said that flowers on Mother 's Day were " sweet and nice , " but something ought to be done for the 14,000 mothers who die every year from childbirth . A Manhattan tobacconist displayed a selection of women 's pipes and four men in Philadelphia were arrested for breaking into a greenhouse and stealing 2,000 Mother 's Day carnations . <P> In Manhattan the Golden Rule Foundation * held a contest for American Mother of 1938 . Mrs. Grace Noll Crowell of Dallas , Tex . just nosed out Mrs. Eddie Cantor . Mrs. Crowell has three children and has written 1,900 poems , a large number of them about the Home . Last week she arrived in Manhattan with her husband , was put up at the St. Moritz , given a medal , presented to Mrs. James Roosevelt , Mayor LaGuardia , Grover Whalen . Said Mrs. Crowell : " Womanhood is fundamentally sound . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother 's Day . Whenever she thinks of what the flower shops , the candy stores , the telegraph companies have done with her idea , she is disgusted . She has even incorporated Mother 's Day to help keep unscrupulous florists and confectioners from using her patented trademark for commercial purposes . But " nobody , " she says , " pays any attention to law any more . " <P> Once she was arrested for disorderly conduct for interrupting a Philadelphia meeting of American War Mothers , whom she accused of profiteering on Mother 's Day carnations . In 1934 she kept James Aloysius Farley from putting " Mother 's Day " on his special 3 Whistler 's Mother stamp , which she said was just another racket . Last week on Mother 's Day she contented herself with denouncing a Manhattan " Mother 's Peace Day " parade and a " Parents ' Day " meeting in Central Park . ( One of her current slogans is " Do n't Kick Mother out of Mother 's Day . " ) Then she dedicated an eternal light to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor at the Church of the Saviour . <P> The idea for Mother 's Day came to Miss Jarvis on the second Sunday in May , 1907 , the first anniversary of her mother 's death . She persuaded a Philadelphia church to hold a special service : in a few years every church in the land was holding special services . In 1908 the Governor of Florida issued a special Mother 's Day proclamation . Before he died a few years ago he called Miss Jarvis to his bedside and asked her if he had been the first Governor to get aboard the bandwagon . Tenderheartedly she said yes , but actually the Governor of North Dakota , she says , beat him to it by several days . Then in 1914 President Wilson issued a National proclamation and the flower stores began to sense the possibilities . Miss Jarvis started her hopeless , 25-year fight against commercialism.
