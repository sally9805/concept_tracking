Off the Army transport St. Mihiel at Seward , Alaska last week trudged the second &; final contingent of Depression-whipped U. S. farmers who had taken up the Government 's offer of a new life in Matanuska Valley ( TIME , May 6 ; LETTERS , May 27 ) . Leaving their wives &; children behind for a few days , 136 men swung aboard day coaches , rode all night to Palmer . There they lined up with their 67 predecessors , shuffled past the colony 's genial Chief Don Irwin , dipping their hands into his hat . A slip of paper told each man which 40 acres , barring swaps , failure or despair , were to be his home until he died . Without a stop to look at their new land , the 136 new colonists pitched in to help unload the train , scatter farm equipment and household goods among eight temporary tent colonies .
