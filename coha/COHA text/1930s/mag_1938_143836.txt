Stop-Over ( by Matt and Sam Taylor ; produced by Chase Productions , Inc . ) . To prove that suffering regenerates the human spirit , the Brothers Taylor coop up an odd lot of sinners for one night , torment them with gunplay and passion , turn them loose before dawn , chastened and wiser . <P> A better melodrama than a sermon , Stop-Over assembles its characters by a neat device . On the night that Bartley Langthorne ( Sidney Blackmer ) , a played-out romantic actor , returns to his small town mansion for a rest cure , Halloween pranksters plant a Tourists Accommodated sign in his front yard . Tourists pour in , but can not pour out because the housekeeper 's gangster husband ( Arthur Byron ) holds them prisoners with his gun . <P> Norris Houghton has designed a perfect setting for melodrama , a mid-Victorian living room encrusted with gimcracks and statues , any one of which might inspire crime . But Stop-Over , after a good takeoff , gets bogged in its own dull subplots . Its chief actor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make wry cracks . <P> Best performance : Arthur Byron , as the gangster who is remorseful for having been a bad father but disgusted that his own son should be inept enough to fall into the clutches of the cops . <P> The Greatest Show on Earth ( by Vincent Duffey &; Irene Alexander ; produced by Bonfils &; Somnes , Inc . ) . Playwrights Duffey and Alexander seem unable to decide whether they are satirizing mankind or writing seriously about the anguish of caged beasts . The result is occasionally funny , occasionally mordant , mostly an addled mixture . Partly atoning for the commonplace writing of The Greatest Show on Earth are its ingenious costumes , handsome production , and the acting of Edgar Stehli as Slimy , the serpent . As he slithers among the bears and elephants , hissing in Cockney , inciting Leo the Lion ( Anthony Ross ) to murder the Keeper , Actor Stehli commits only one zoological error . He wickedly nickers his tongue to show malice . Real snakes , without malice , flicker their tongues to smell . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marwell Productions , Inc . ) . Marwell Productions is the sheerly corporate cloak of Actors Fredric March &; wife ( Florence Eldridge ) and Play Director John Cromwell . For Yr Obedient Husband , Actor March returned to the stage after some ten years in Hollywood , where a prime specialty of his has been rakehellish roles . But in raking through the career of Richard Steele , 18th Century London journalist &; man-about-town . Playwright Jackson had failed to scrape together enough action for three acts . What he had written was a costume play on wordy marital misunderstandings . When the critical votes were counted , there were no thumbs up . After six performances the Marches &; Director Cromwell took the hint with rare good humor . Their show closed the next night , but before it did Marwell Productions took to the advertising columns of Manhattan 's newspapers with a graceful exit line : <P> Tortilla Flat ( adapted by Jack Kirkland ; produced by Jack Kirkland &; Sam H. Grisman ) . Critics , like partridges , should never be shot sitting . That this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
