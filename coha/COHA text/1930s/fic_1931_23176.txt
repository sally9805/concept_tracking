GREEN THOUGHTS A STORY BY JOHN COLLIER T HE orchid had been sent among the effects of his friend , who had come by a lonely and mysterious death on the expedition . Or he had bought it among a miscellaneous lot , " unclassified , " at the close of the auction . I forget which , but one or the other it certainly was ; moreover , even in its dry , brown , dormant root state , this orchid had a certain sinister quality . It looked , with its bunched and ragged projections , like a rigid yet a gripping hand , hideously gnarled , or a grotesquely whiskered , threatening face . Would you not have known what sort of an orchid it was ? Mr. Mannering did not know . He read nothing but catalogues and books on fertilizers . He unpacked the new acquisition with a solicitude absurd enough in any ease towards any orchid , or primrose either , in the twentieth century , but idiotic , foolhardy , doom-eager , when extended to an orchid thus come by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once planted it in what he called the " Observation Ward , " a hothouse built against the south wall of his dumpy , red dwelling . Here he set always the most interesting additions to his collection , and especially weak and sickly plants , for there was a glass door in his study wall through which he could see into this hothouse , so that the weak and sickly plants could encounter no crisis without his immediate knowledge , This plant , however , proved hardy enough . At the ends of thick and stringy stalks it opened out bunches of darkly shining leaves , and soon it spread in every direction , usurping so much space that first one , then another , then all its neighbors had to be removed to a hothouse at the end of the garden . It was , Cousin Jane said , a regular hop-vine . At the ends of the stalks , just before the leaves began , were set groups of tendrils , which hung idly , serving no apparent purpose . Mr. Mannering thought that very probably these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plant had been a climber . But when were the vestigial tendrils of an ex-climber half or quarter so thick and strong ? After a long time sets of tiny buds appeared here and there among the extravagant foliage . Soon they opened into small flowers , miserable little things : they looked like flies ' heads . One naturally expects a large , garish , sinister bloom , like a sea anemone , or a Chinese lantern , or a hippopotamus yawning , on any important orchid ; and should it be an unclassified one as well , I think one has every right to insist on a sickly and overpowering scent into the bargain . Mr. Mannering did not mind at all . Indeed , apart from his joy and happiness in being the discoverer and godfather of a new sort of orchid , he felt only a mild and scientific interest in the fact that the paltry blossoms were so very much like flies ' heads . Could it be to attract other flies for food or as fertilizers ? But then , why like their heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cat disappeared . This was a great blow to Cousin Jane , but Mr. Mannering was not , in his heart of hearts , greatly sorry . He was not fond of the cat , for he could not open the smallest chink in a glass roof for ventilation but that creature would squeeze through somehow to enjoy the warmth , and in this way it had broken many a tender shoot . But before poor Cousin Jane had lamented two days something happened which so engrossed Mr. Mannering that he had no mind left at all with which to sympathize with her affliction or to make at breakfast kind and hypocritical inquiries after the lost cat . A strange new bud appeared on the orchid . It was clearly evident that there would be two quite different sorts of bloom on this one plant , as sometimes happens in such fantastic corners of the vegetable world , and that the new flower would he very different in size and structure from the earlier ones . It grew bigger and bigger , till it was as big as one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been more inopportune , an affair of the most unpleasant , the most distressing nature summoned Mr. Mannering to town . It was his wretched nephew , in trouble again , and this time so deeply and so very disgracefully that it took all Mr. Mannering 's generosity , and all his influence too , to extricate the worthless young man . Indeed , as soon as he saw the state of affairs , he told the prodigal that this was the very last time he might expect assistance , that his vices and his ingratitude had long cancelled all affection between them , and that for this last helping hand he was indebted only to his mother 's memory , and to no faith onthe part of his uncle either in his repentance or his reformation . He wrote , moreover , to Cousin Jane , to relieve his feelings , telling her of the whole business , and adding that the only thing left to do was to cut the young man off entirely . When he got back to Torquay Cousin Jane had disappeared . The situation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very old and very stupid and very deaf . She suffered besides from an obsession , due to the fact that for many years Mr. Mannering had had no conversation with her in which he had not included an impressive reminder that she must always , no matter what might happen , keep the big kitchen stove up to a certain pitch of activity . For this stove , besides supplying the house with hot water , heated the pipes in the " Observation Ward , " to which the daily gardener who had charge of the other hothouses had no access . By this time she had come to regard her duties as stoker as her chief raison d'etre , and it was difficult to penetrate her deafness with any question which her stupidity and her obsession did not somehow transmute into an inquiry after the stove , and this , of course , was especially the case when Mr. Mannering spoke to her . All he could disentangle was what she had volunteered on first seeing him , that his cousin had not been seen for three days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Mannering was perplexed and annoyed but , being a man of method , he thought it best to postpone further inquiries until he had refreshed himself a little after his long and tiring journey . A full supply of energy was necessary to extract any information from the old cook ; besides , there was probably a note somewhere . It was only natural that before he went to his room , Mr. Mannering should peep into the hothouse , just to make sure that the won-derful orchid had come to no harm during the inconsiderate absence of Cousin Jane , As soon as he opened the door his eyes fell upon the bud ; it had now changed in shape very considerably , and had increased in size to the bigness of a human head . It is no exaggeration to state that Mr. Mannering remained rooted to the spot , with his eyes fixed upon this wonderful bud , for fully five minutes . But , you will ask , why did he not see her clothes on the floor ? Well , as a matter of fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no clothes on the floor . Cousin Jane , though of course she was entirely estimable in every respect , though she was well over forty , too , was given to the practice of the very latest ideas on the dual culture of the soul and body  --  Swedish , German , neo-Greek and all that . And the orchid-house was the warmest place available . I must proceed with the order of events . Mr. Mannering at length withdrew his eyes from this stupendous bud and decided that he must devote his attention to the gray exigencies of everyday life . But although his body dutifully ascended the stairs , heart , mind , and soul all remained in adoration of the plant . Although he was philosophical to the point of insensibility over the miserable smallness of the earlier flowers , yet he was now as much gratified by the magnitude of the great new bud as you or I might be . Hence it was not unnatural that Mr. Mannering while in his bath should be full of the most exalted visions of the blossoming of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the largest known , by far : complex as a dream , or dazzlingly simple . It would open like a dancer , or like the sun rising . Why , it might be opening at this very moment ! At this thought Mr. Mannering could restrain himself no longer ; he rose from the steamy water , and , wrapping his bath-towel robe about him , hurried down to the hothouse , scarcely staying to dry himself , though he was subject to colds . The bud had not yet opened : it still reared its unbroken head among the glossy , fleshy foliage , and he now saw , what he had had no eyes for previously , how very exuberant that foliage had grown . Suddenly he realized with astonishment that this huge bud was not that which had appeared before he went away . That one had been lower down on the plant . Where was it now , then ? Why , this new thrust and spread of foliage concealed it from him . He walked across , and discovered it . It had opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloom his astonishment grew to stupefaction , one might say to petrification , for it is a fact that Mr. Mannering remained rooted t.3 the spot , with his eyes fixed on the flower , for fully fifteen minutes . The flower was an exact replica of the head of Cousin Jane 's lost cat . The similitude was so exact , so lifelike , that Mr. Mannering 's first movement , after the fifteen minutes , was to seize his bath-towel robe and draw it about him , for he was a modest man , and the cat , though bought for a Tom , had proved to be quite the reverse . I relate this to show how much character , spirit , presence  --  call it what you will  --  there was upon this floral cat 's face . But although he made to seize his bath-towel robe , it was too late : he could not move ; the new lusty foliage had closed in unperceived , the too lightly dismissed tendrils were everywhere upon him ; he gave a few weak cries and sank to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary life , he pas.ses out of this story . Mr. Mannering sank into a coma , into an insensibility so deep that a black eternity passed before the first faint elements of his consciousness reassembled themselves in his brain . For of his brain was the center of a new bud being made . Indeed , it was two or three days before this , at first almost shapeless and quite primitive lump of organic matter , had become sufficiently mature to be called Mr. Mannering at all . These days , which passed quickly enough , in a certain mild , not unpleasant excitement , in the outer world , seemed to the dimly working mind within the bud to resume the whole history of the development of our species , in a great many epochal parts . A process analogous to the mutations of the embryo was being enacted here . At last the entity which was thus being rushed down an absurdly foreshortened vista of the ages arrived , slowing up , into the foreground . It became recognizable . The Seven Ages of Mr. Mannering were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close-ups , as in an educational film ; his consciousness settled and cleared ; the bud was mature , ready to open . At this point , I believe , Mr. Mannering 's state of mind was exactly that of a patient who , struggling up from vague dreams , wakening from under an anaesthetic , asks plaintively , " Where am I ? " Then the bud opened , and he knew . There was the hothouse , but seen from an unfamiliar angle ; there , through the glass door , was his study , and there below him was the cat 's head and there  --  there beside him was Cousin Jane . He could not say a word , but then , neither could she . Perhaps it was as well . At the very least , he would have been forced to own that she had been in the right in an argument of long standing ; she had always maintained that in the end no good would come of his preoccupation with " those unnatural flowers . " Yet it must be admitted that Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upheaval in his daily life . This , I think , wasbecause he was interested , not only in private and personal matters , but in the wider and more general , one might say the biological , aspects of his metamorphosis ; for the rest , simply because he was now a vegetable , he responded with a vegetable reaction . The impossibility of locomotion , for example , did not trouble him in the least , or even the absence of body and limbs , any more than the cessation of that stream of rashers and tea , biscuits and glasses of milk , luncheon cutlets , and so forth that had flowed in at his mouth for over fifty years , but which had now been reversed to a gentle , continuous , scarcely noticeable feeding from below . All the powerful influence of the physical upon the mental , therefore , inclined him towards tranquillity . But the physical is not all . Although no longer a man , he was still Mr. Mannering . And from this anomaly , as soon as his scientific interest had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in He was fretted , for instance , by the thought that he would now have no opportunity to name his orchid or to write a paper upon it and , still worse , there grew up in his mind the abominable conviction that , as soon as his plight was discovered , it was he who would be named and classified , and that he himself would be the subject of a paper , possibly even of comment and criticism in the lay press . Like all orchid collectors , be was excessively shy and sensitive , and in his present situation these qualities were very naturally exaggerated , so that the bare idea of such attentions brought him to the verge of wilting . Worse yet was the fear of being transplanted , thrust into some unfamiliar , draughty , probably public place . Being dug up ! Ugh ! A violent shudder pulsated through all the heavy foliage that sprang from Mr. Mannering 's division of the plant . He awoke to conscious-ness of ghostly and remote sensations in the stem below , and in certain tufts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spine and heart and limbs . He felt quite a dryad . In spite of all , however , the sunshine was very pleasant . The rich odor of hot , spicy earth filled the hothouse . From a special fixture on the hot-water pipes a little warm steam oozed into the air . Mr. Mannering began to abandon himself to a feeling of laissez-aller . Just then , up in the corner of the glass roof , at the ventilator , he heard a persistent buzzing . Soon the note changed from one of irritation to a more complacent sound ; a bee had managed to find his way after some difficulty through one of the tiny chinks in the metal work . The visitor came drifting down and down through the still , green air , as if into some subaqueous world , and he came to rest on one of those petals which were Mr. Mannering 's eyebrows . Thence he commenced to explore one feature after another and at last he settled heavily on the lower lip , which drooped under his weight and allowed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was quite a considerable shock , of course , but on the whole the sensation was neither as alarming nor as unpleasant as might have been expected ; indeed , strange as it may sound , the appropriate word seemed to be something like . .. refreshing . But Mr. Mannering soon ceased his drowsy toyings with the mot juste when he saw the departed bee , after one or two lazy circlings , settle directly upon the maiden lip of Cousin Jane . Ominous as lightning , a simple botanical principle flashed across the mind of her wretched relative . Cousin Jane was aware of it also , although , being the product of an earlier age , she might have remained still blessedly ignorant had not her cousin , vain , garrulous , proselytizing fool , attempted for years past to interest her in the rudiments of botany . How the miserable man upbraided himself now ! He saw two bunches of leaves just below the flower tremble and flutter and rear themselves painfully upward into the very likeness of two shocked and protesting hands . He saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and incarnadine with rage and embarrassment , then turn sickly as a gardenia with horror and dismay . But what was he to do ? All the rectitude implanted by his careful training , all the chivalry proper to an orchid-collector , boiled and surged beneath a paralytically calm exterior . He positively travailed in the effort to activate the muscles of his face , to assume an expression of grief , manly contrition , helplessness in the face of fate , willingness to make all honorable amends , all suffused with the light of a vague but solacing optimism ; but it was all in vain . When he had strained till his nerves seemed likely to tear under the tension , the only movement he could achieve was a trivial flutter of the Left eyelid  --  worse than nothing . This incident completely aroused Mr. Mannering from his vegetative lethargy . He rebelled against the limitations of the form into which he had thus been cast while subjectively he remained all too human . Was he not still at heart a man , with a man 's hopes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusk came and the opulent and sinister shapes of the great plant dimmed to a suggestiveness more powerfully impressive than had been its bright noonday luxuriance , and the atmosphere of a tropical forest filled the orchid-house like an exile 's dream or the nostalgia of the saxophone ; when the cat 's whiskers drooped , and even Cousin Jane 's eyes slowly closed , the unhappy man remained wide awake , staring into the gathering darkness . Suddenly the light in the study was switched on . Two men entered the room . One of them was his lawyer , the other was his nephew . " This is his study , as you know , of course , " said the wicked nephew . " There 's nothing here . I looked round when I came over on Wednesday . " " Ah ! well , " said the lawyer . " It 's a very queer business , an absolute mystery . " He had evidently said so more than once before ; they must have been discussing matters in another room . " Well , we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the circumstances , it 's perhaps as well that you , as next-of-kin , should take charge of things here . We must hope for the best . " Saying this , the lawyer turned , about to go , and Mr. Mannering saw a malicious smile overspread the young man 's face . The uneasiness which had overcome him at first sight of his nephew was intensified to fear and trembling at the sight of this smile . When he had shown the lawyer out the nephew returned to the study and looked around him with lively and sinister satisfaction . Then he cut a caper on the bearthrug . Mr. Mannering thought he had never seen anything so diabolical as this solitary expression of the glee of a venomous nature at the prospect of unchecked sway , here whence he had been outcast . How vulgar petty triumph appeared , beheld thus ; how disgusting petty spite , how appalling revengefulness and hardness of heart ! He remembered suddenly that his nephew had been notable , in his repulsive childhood , for his cruelty to flies , tearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A sort of dew might have been noticed upon the good man 's forehead . It seemed to him that his nephew had only to glance that way and all would be discovered , although he might have remembered that it was impossible to see from the lighted room into the darlmess in the hothouse . On the mantelpiece stood a large unframed photograph of Mr. Mannering . His nephew soon caught sight of this and strode across to confront it with a triumphant and insofent sneer . " What ? You old Pharisee , " said he , " taken her off for a trip to Brighton , have you ? My God ! How I hope you 'll never come back ! How I hope you 've fallen over the cliffs , or got swept off by the tide or something ! Anyway . . . I 'll make hay while the sun shines . Ugh ! you old skinflint , you ! " And he reached forward his hand , on which the thumb held the middle finger bent and in check , and that finger , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then the usurping rascal left the room , leaving all the lights on , presumably preferring the dining room with its cellarette to the scholarly austerities of the study . All night long the glare of electric light from the study fell full upon Mr. Mannering and his Cousin Jane , like the glare of a cheap and artificial sun . You , who have seen at midnight , in the park , a few insomniac asters standing stiff and startled under an arc light , all their weak color bleached out of them by the drenching chemical radiance , neither asleep nor awake , but held fast in a tense , a neurasthenic trance , you can form an idea of how the night passed with this unhappy pair . And towards morning an incident occurred , trivial in itself , no doubt , but sufficient then and there to add the last drop to poor Cousin Jane 's discomfiture and to her relative 's embarrassment and remorse . Along the edge of the great earth-box in which the orchid was planted ran a small black mouse . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and huge , repellent ears , queer as a bat 's . This creature ran straight over the lower leaves of Cousin Jane 's part of the plant . It was simply appalling : the stringy main stem writhed like a hair on a coal-fire , the leaves contracted in an agonized spasm , like seared mimosa ; the terrified lady nearly uprooted herself in her convulsive horror . I think she would actually have done so , had not the mouse hurried on past her . But it had not gone more than a foot or so when it looked up and saw , bending over it , and seeming positively to bristle with life , that flower which had once been called Tib . There was a breathless pause . The mouse was obviously paralyzed with terror , the cat could only look and long . Suddenly the more human watchers saw a sly frond of foliage curve softly outward and close in behind the hypnotized creature . Cousin Jane , who had been thinking exultantly , " Well , now it 'll go away and never , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hideous possibilities . Summoning all her energy , she achieved a spasmodic flutter , enough to break the trance that held the mouse , so that , like a clockwork toy , it swung round and fled . But already the fell arm of the orchid had cut off its retreat , the mouse lea straight at it ; like a flash five tendrils at the end caught the fugitive and held it fast , and soon its body dwindled and was gone . Now the heart of Cousin Jane was troubled with horrid fears , and slowly and painfully she turned her weary face first to one side , then to the other , in a fever of anxiety as to where the new bud would appear . A sort of sucker , green and sappy , which twisted lightly about her main stem , and reared a blunt head , much like a tip of asparagus , close to her own , suddenly began to swell in the most suspicious manner . She squinted at it , fascinated and appalled . Could it be her imagination ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened again , and again the nephew entered thestudy . This time he was alone , and it was evident that he had come straight from table . He carried in his hand a decanter of whiskey capped by an inverted glass . Under his arm was a siphon . His face was distinctly flushed , and such a smile as is often seen at saloon bars played about his lips . He put down his burdens and , turning to Mr. Manncring 's cigar cabinet , produced a bunch of keys which he proceeded to try upon the lock , muttering vindictively at each abortive attempt , until it opened , when he helped himself from the best of its contents . Annoying as it was to witness this insolent appropriation of his property , and mortifying to see the contempt with which the cigar was smoked , the good gentleman found deeper cause for uneasiness in the thought that , with the possession of the keys , his abominable nephew had access to every private corner that was his . At present , however , the usurper seemed indisposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whiskey into the tumbler and relaxed into an attitude of extravagant comfort . But after a while the young man began to tire of his own company ; he had not yet had time to gather any of his pothouse companions into his uncle 's home , and repeated recourse to the whiskey bottle only increased his longing for something to relieve the monotony . His eye fell upon the door of the orchid-house . Sooner or later it was bound to have come to pass . Does this thought greatly console the condemned man when the fatal knock sounds upon the door of his cell ? No . Nor were the hearts of the trembling pair in the hothouse at all succored by the reflection . As the nephew fumbled with the handle of the glass door , Cousin Jane slowly raised two fronds of leaves that grew on each side , high up on her stem , and sank her troubled head be-hind them . Mr. Mannering observed , in a sudden rapture of hope , that by this device she was fairly well concealed from any casual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately , he had not yet gained sufficient control of his  --  his limb , , ? ? and all his tortured efforts could not raise them beyond an agonized horizontal . The door had opened , the nephew was feeling for the electric light switch just inside . It was a moment for one of the superlative achievements of panic . Mr. Mannering was well equipped for the occasion . Suddenly , at the cost of indescribable effort , he succeeded in raising the right frond , not straight upwards , it is true , but in a series of painful jerks along a curve outward and backward , and ascending by slow degrees till it attained the position of an arm held over the possessor 's head from behind . Then , as the light flashed on , a spray of leaves at the very end of this frond spread out into a fan , rather like a very fleshy horse-chestnut leaf in structure , and covered the anxious face below . What a relief ! And now the nephew advanced into the orchid-house , and now the hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simultaneously also , their very sap stood still in their veins . The nephew was walking along by the plant . The cat , a sagacious beast , " knew " with the infallible intuition of its kind that this was an idler , a parasite , a sensualist , gross and brutal , disrespectful to age , insolent to weakness , barbarous to cats . Therefore it remained very still , trusting to its low and somewhat retired position on the plant , and to protective mimicry and such things , and to the half-drunken condition of the nephew , to avoid his notice . But all in vain . " What ? " said the nephew , " What , a cat ? " And he raised his hand to offer a blow at the harmless creature . Something in the dignified and unflinching demeanor of his victim must have penetrated into even his besotted mind , for the blow never fell , and the bully , a coward at heart , as bullies invariably are , shifted his gaze from side to side to escape the steady , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye fell on something glimmering whitely behind the dark foliage . He brushed aside the intervening leaves that he might see what it was . It was Cousin Jane . " Oh ! Ah ! " said the young man , in great confusion . " You 're back . But what arc you hiding there for ? " His sheepish stare became fixed , his mouth opened in bewilderment ; then the true condition of things dawned upon his mind . Most of us would have at once instituted some attempt at communication or at assistance of some kind , or at least have knelt down to thank our Creator that we had , by his grace , been spared such a fate , or perhaps have made haste from the orchid-house to insure against accidents . But alcohol had so inflamed the young man 's hardened nature that he felt neither fear nor awe nor gratitude . As he grasped the situation a devilish smile overspread his face . " Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! " said he , " but where 's the old man ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle . In a moment he had located him and , raising the inadequate visor of leaves , discovered beneath it the face of our hero , troubled with a hundred bitter emotions . " Hullo , Narcissus ! " said the nephew . A long silence ensued . The nephew was so pleased that he could not say a word . He rubbed his hands together , and licked his lips , and stared and stared as a child might at a new toy . " You 're properly up a tree now , " he said . " Yes , the tables are turned now all right , are n't they ? Ha ! Ha ! Do you remember the last time we met ? " A flicker of emotion passed over the face of the suffering blossom , betraying consciousness . " Yes , you can hear what I say , " added the tormentor , " feel , too , I expect . What about that ? " As he spoke , he stretched out his hand and , seizing a delicate frill of fine , silvery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the flower , he administered a sharp tug . Without pausing to note , even in the interests of science , the subtler shades of his uncle 's reaction , content with the general effect of that devastating wince , the wretch chuckled with satisfaction and , taking a long pull from the reeking butt of the stolen cigar , puffed the vile fumes straight into his victim 's center . The brute ! " How do you like that , John the Baptist ? " he asked with a leer . " Good for the blight , you know . Just what you want ! " Something rustled upon his coat sleeve . Looking down , he saw a long stalk , well adorned with the fatal tendrils , groping its way over the arid and unsatisfactory surface . In a moment it had reached his wrist , he felt it fasten , but knocked it off as one would a leech , before it had time to establish its hold . " Ugh ! " said he , " so that 's how it happens , is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the hang of things a hit . I do n't want to be made an Aunt Sally of . Though I should n't think they could get you with your clothes on . " Struck by a sudden thought , he looked from his uncle to Cousin Jane , and from Cousin Jane back to his uncle again . He scanned the floor , and saw a single crumpled bath-towel robe lying in the shadow . " Why ? " he said , " well ! . . . Haw ! Haw ! Haw ! " And with an odiousbackward leer , he made his way out of the orchid-house . Mr. Mannering felt that his suffering was capable of no increase . Yet he dreaded the morrow . His fevered imagination patterned the long night with waking nightmares , utterly fantastic visions of humiliation and torture . Torture ! It was absurd , of course , for him to fear cold-blooded atrocities on the part of his nephew , but how he dreaded some outrageous whim that might tickle the youth 's sense of humor and Lead him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . He thought of slugs and snails , espaliers and topiary . If only the monster would rest content with insults and mockery , with wasting his substance , ravaging his cherished possessions before his eyes , with occasional pulling at the whiskers , even ! Then it might be possible to turn gradually from all that still remained in him of man , to subdue the passions , no longer to admire or desire , to go native , as it were , relapsing into the Nirvana of a vegetable dream . But in the morning he found this was not so easy . In came the nephew and , pausing only to utter the most perfunctory of jeers at his relatives in the glass house , he sat at the desk and unlocked the top drawer . He was evidently in search of money , his eagerness betrayed that ; no doubt he had run through all he had filched from his uncle 's pockets , and had not yet worked out a scheme for getting direct control of his bank account . However , the drawer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with satisfaction and , summoning the housekeeper , to bellow into her ear a reckless order upon the wine and spirit merchant . " Get along with you , " he shouted , when he had at last made her understand . " I shall have to get someone a bit more on the spot to wait on me ; I can tell you that . " " Yes , " he added to himself as the poor old woman hobbled away , deeply hurt by his bullying manner , " yes , a nice little parlor-maid . . . a nice little parlor-maid . " He hunted in the Buff Book for the number of the local registry office . That afternoon he interviewed a succession of maidservants in his uncle 's study . Those that happened to be plain , or too obviously respectable , he treated curtly and coldly ; they soon made way for others . It was only when a girl was attractive ( according to the young man 's depraved tastes , that is ) and also bore herself in a fast or brazen manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these camas the nephew would conclude in a fashion that left no doubt at all in the minds of any of his auditors as to his real intentions . Once , for example , leaning forward , he took the girl by the chin , saying with an odious smirk , " There 's no one else but me , and so you 'd he treated just like one of the family ; d' you see , my dear ? " To another he would say , slipping his arm round her waist , " Do you think we shall get on well together ? " After this conduct had sent two or three in confusion from the room , there entered a young person of the most regrettable description , one whose character , betrayed as it was in her meretricious finery , her crude cosmetics , and her tinted hair , showed yet more clearly in florid gesture and too facile smile . The nephew lost no time in coming to an arrangement with this creature . Indeed , her true nature was so obvious that the depraved young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a sauce to his anticipations , enjoying the contrast between conventional dialogue and unbridled glances . She was to come next day . Mr. Mannering feared more for his unhappy cousin than for himself . " What scenes may she not have to witness , " he thought , " that yellow cheek of hers to inearnadine ? " If only he could have said a few words ! But that evening , when the nephew came to take his ease in the study , it was obvious that he was far more under the influence of liquor than had been the case before . His face , flushed patchily by the action of the spirits , wore a sullen sneer , an ominous light burned in that bleared eye , he muttered savagely under his breath . Clearly this fiend in human shape was what is known as " fighting drunk " ; clearly some trifle had set his vile temper in a blaze . It is interesting to note , even at this stage , a sudden change in Mr. Mannering 's reactions . They now seemed entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly associated with physical matters . The nephew kicked a hole in a screen in his drunken fury , he flung a burning cigar-end down on the carpet , he scratched matches on the polished table . His uncle witnessed this with the calm of one whose sense of property and of dignity has become numbed and paralyzed ; he felt neither fury nor mortification . Had he , by one of those sudden strides by which all such development takes place , approached much nearer to his goal , complete vegetation ? His concern for the threatened modesty of Cousin Jane , which had moved him so strongly only a few hours earlier , must have been the last dying flicker of exhausted altruism ; that most human characteristic had faded from him . The change , however , in its present stage , was not an unmixed blessing . Narrowing in from the wider and more expressly human regions of his being , his consciousness now left outside its focus not only pride and altruism , which had been responsible for much of his woe , but fortitude and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had been his support before the whole battery of his distresses . Moreover , within its constricted circle , his ego was not reduced but concentrated , his serene , flowerlike indifference towards the ill-usage of his furniture was balanced by the absorbed , flowerlike single-mindedness of his terror at the thought of similar ill-usage directed towards himself .

My ear , long closed to sounds of earth , still winces When men say Samarkand , Samos , Hongkong . Alone I trace the magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even  --  For one 's in Samarkand and one 's in Samos And one 's in Heaven .
