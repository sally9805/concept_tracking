On his recent visit to Sweden , strutting General Hermann Wilhelm Gring , Premier of Prussia and Germany 's No. 2 Nazi , laid an enormous , swastika-shaped contraption of laurel branches on the tombstone of his epileptic wife. * Last week an irate anti-Nazi raiding party entered the cemetery , carried off the Goring laurel swastika and left this note behind : <P> " Some of us Swedes feel insulted by Goring 's violation of tombs . His wife may rest in peace , but beware of German propaganda on a tombstone . " <P> <P> *In The Brown Book of the Hitler Terror , prepared by a committee chairmanned by British Laborite Lord Marley , appears a photostatic copy of a certificate signed by Stockholm 's Police Doctor Karl Lundberg on April 16 , 1926 : " Captain Gring is a morphia addict and his wife Frau Carin Gring , nee Baroness Fock , suffers from epilepsy . Their home must therefore be regarded as unfitted for her son Thomas . "               @ @ @ @ @ @
