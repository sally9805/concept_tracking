Since Helen Wills Moody was entered in the Women 's National Singles Championship at Forest Hills last week , there was no doubt that she would win . It was merely a question of whom she would beat and how badly . <P> In the first round , her opponent was able Edith Sigourney of Boston . Mrs. Moody won 6-0 , 6-0 . <P> In the second round she played Mary Greef of Kansas City , who made her work a little harder . The score was 6-2 , 6-3 . <P> Joan Ridley , an English player but not a member of the Wightman Cup team , got as far as 3-a11 in the first set the next day , when a storm interrupted the matches and drenched 2,500 spectators . Mrs. Moody won the next nine games and the match 6-3 , 6-0 . <P> Dorothy Weisel , a hard-hitting California girl against whom Mrs. Moody has no grudge as she has against Californian Helen Jacobs , was next . She covered her court well , made Mrs. Moody run her hardest , lost 6-1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adversary was Phyllis Mudford , smallest member of the British Wightman Cup team , who had beaten Sarah Palfrey of Boston in the third round . Wearing an eyeshade and an expression of appealing determination , she looked so eagerly incompetent that Mrs. Moody neglected to put customary pace on her shots after winning the first five games . Little Miss Mudford then played as tigerishly as she could , ran the score to 6-2 , 6-4 . <P> In the finals , Mrs. Moody 's opponent was Eileen Bennett Whittingstall . Before her marriage to Painter Edmund Fearnley Whittingstall , Eileen Bennett defeated Mrs. Molla Mallory in the 1928 Wightman Cup Matches . Still the prettiest and best-dressed of woman tennis players , her game has improved brilliantly this year . But while Mrs. Moody was sweeping through the upper half of the draw almost as easily as in 1929 . Mrs. Whittingstall was having a hard time of it in the lower half . In the quarter-finals she played a great match against Helen Jacobs , considered second best woman player in the U.S. After reaching 3-1 in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next five games , then came back to win two sets and the match 3-6 , 6-3 , 8-6 . In the semifinals , she played Betty Nuthall , defending champion and No. 1 on the British Wightman Cup team . Mrs. Whittingstall had beaten Betty Nuthall once before this year and did it again last week 6-2 , 3-6 , 6-4 . <P> When they started their match . Mrs. Moody won the first three games , the last on a line decision which spectators questioned . Mrs. Whittingstall lost only two points in the next three games , but she weakened when the score was tied at four-all and lost the set . Obviously fatigued by two three-set matches on preceding days , she won only one game in the second set . The match was over in 35 minutes , 6-4 , 6-1 . <P> Mrs. Moody , who has not lost a set in singles competition since 1927 , received the Championship Cup , which she had not tried for last year , for the seventh time , denied renewed rumors that she would turn professional . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nuthall , won the U.S. Women 's Doubles Championship by beating Dorothy Round and Helen Jacobs 6-2 , 6-4.
