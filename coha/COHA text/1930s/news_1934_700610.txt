txt When general debate on the FletcherRayburn Stock Exchange Regulation Bill ended in the House late this afternoon , and the five-minute rule permitting amendments from the floor became the order , the House , Instead of proceeding with the reading of the bill , wrangled for an hour as to its authorship . Representative Britten , Republican , of Illinois , contended the original bill was written by junior members of the " Brain Trust , " while the redraft now before the House was written by Benjamin Cohen of the legal staff of the Department of the Interior . According to Mr. Britten , Mr. Cohen is an important unit of the " Brain Trust " and a resident of what he calls " ' the scarlet fever house , " or the " Little Red House " in Georgetown , the residence occupied by Professor Felix Frankfurter and a few other junior officials . The seven hours of general debate disclosed that the opposition to the bill is negligible and that when the vote on passage is ordered it will command a majority on both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the support of the bill is apparently so overwhelming that it may be passed without a roll call . Most of the speeches today were made by Republicans , and with the exception of Mr. Britten every one of them indicated he would vote for the bill . Republicans Challenge Britten . The wrangle followed Mr. Britten 's reference to the fact that Mr. Cohen was seated next to Representative Rayburn , chairman of the Committee on Interstate Commerce , acting , at Mr. Rayburn 's request , as an adviser . Mr. Cohen appeared much embarrassed and after a moment 's talk with Mr. Rayburn left the chamber ' . But his departure failed to quiet the storm . Calling the original bill a " monstrosity , " Mr. Britten said that Mr. Cohen sat in all executive sessions and practically directed the rewriting . Representative Pettengill of Indiana , a member of the committee , demanded that he name his informant . Mr. Britten did not do so . Mr. Rayburn pointed out that Mr. Cohen 's presence on the floor as an adviser was not unusual . Representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said the redraft was in every line the work of Mr. Rayburn and the members of the committee . Representative Mapes , next ranking Republican member , said the same thing and the House broke into applause . Thereupon Mr. Britten subsided . Mr. Cooper , then Mr. Mapes , Mr. Beedy of Maine , Mr. Fish of New York , all Republicans , announced their intention of voting " yea " on the bill . Some amendments may be approved , however . One possible conflict involves the administration of the act . Representative Buiwinkle of North Carolina announced that he would move to eliminate the Federal Trade Commission as the administrative agency and substitute a commission I of three members to be appointed by the President , subject to , confirmation by the Senate . In effect , this is the Glass amendment adopted by the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency . It is not believed that the amendment will carry , although its support will be substantial from both sides of the aisle . Representative Mapes , who was one of the writers of the redrafted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplish the regulation of Stock Exchanges and that it will do so with a minimum of interference with legitimate business and industry , not excepting the business of the Exchanges themselves . " Moreover , it would have very little , if any , direct interference , he said , with.local business or industry . Mr. Mapes thought , in fact , that such an , act will help and stimulate all industry and commerce " by preventing an undue amount of the money and credit of the nation from going into speculative channels . " The bill as it stands , he pointed out , is a very different proposition from the original written under the direction of government officials . Extreme criticism of the measure , in his opinion , was based an the original draft and not the bill reported out by the committee . " I sometimes wonder , " he said , " If those who protestet , loudest against the passage of this legislation in the name of business are true representatives of business in their opposition to it , or if they are misrepresenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as anxious as any one ' to have the abuses corrected which this legislation seeks to correct . No one will benefit by it more . " Representative Cooper was of the opinion that the provisions dealing with misrepresentation were too drastic and should be . modified . Nevertheless , he said , he will vote for it . The New York Stock Exchange was pictured as a " Monte Carlo " by Representative Pettengill . Every one realizes , he declared , that the Exchange has operated in a dual capacity , some times beneficially and other times harmfully . " It is a sort of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde . " he added . " We want to kill the ' jackal ' but save the ' hide . ' " Representative Traux informed the House that he favored the measure principally because he is against Wall Street . He was delighted , he said , to vote for a bill that is " doing something to Wall Street instead of giving something to Wall Street . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
