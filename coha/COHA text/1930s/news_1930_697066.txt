txt For various reasons , for diametrically opposite reasons , the Supreme Court has been attacked by Federalists , anti-Federalists , Democrats , Republicans , Lafolettians , conservatives , radicals , representatives of labor and of capital . The latest babble against it in the Senate is of the feeblest . Senator NYE comes from a region to which the decisions in the granger cases and the decision in the grain elevator case were once a sort , tf gospel of economic emancipation . With characteristic sobriety he says that Supreme power is in the hands of the Judges , who can set aside at will any expression of the people 's will made through an act of Congress or a State Legislature . He must be aware that the invariable rule of the Court is to presume the validity of a law until It is proved beyond reasonable doubt to violate the Constitution . He must likewise be aware that it is an occasional trick of Legislatures and Congress to pass for political reasons an act known to be of doubtful constitutional validity . Mr. NYE is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toe of some Congressmen , ungrateful to the Supreme Court for its great extension of the powers of Congress by widening the field of Federal legislation : The sooner American citizens get rid of this idea that the Judge is more honorable than the legislator and that the court is entitled to more respect than the Legislature , the clearer will become our perception of the evils of judicial usurpation . Even Mr. NYE 'S perception of those evils is far less vivid and ferocious than was that of men like General SCHENK , BINGHAM , BOUTWELI. , THAD STEVENS and the greater part of the Republican press over the decision in the Milligan case , now unanimously regarded as a great landmark in the history of American liberty . Congress and each house of it will have from year to year so much of respect as it is entitled to by its preponderant wisdom or folly . On that wisdom or folly , on the justice or injustice of any act of Congress brought before the Supreme Court , that tribunal has never passed . It goes as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in upholding legislation . Only in the rarest cases has it pronounced a Federal statute invalid . The power so seldom exercised has by its very existence been a check on Congress . Without it Congress might have become supreme , overriding Executive and Judiciary as well as the States . The functions of the Supreme Court and its use of them have , on the whole , been justified by time . The Constitution and laws of the United States made in pursuance of it and treaties under its authority " shall be the supreme law of the land " ; but such a supremacy , in MADISON 'S words , without a supremacy in the exposition and execution of them would be as much of a mockery as a scabbard put into the hands of a soldier without a sword in it . I have never been able to see that , without such a view of the subject , the Constitution itself could be the supreme law of the land ; or that the uniformity of the Federal authority throughout the parties to it could be preserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disunion could be prevented . Mr. NYE 'S inferiority complex is not likely to be alleviated by the " American citizens " whom he reproves.
