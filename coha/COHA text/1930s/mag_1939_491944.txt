I N THE words of Bill Terry , his favorite sparring partner , National League brass hats regard Larry MacPhail as a " brilliant screwball . " To all players but his own Dodgers , he represents every evil of front-office interference which muddles the pursuit of pennants on the field . He is the darling of the banking gentlemen whose academic interest in baseball ceases abruptly at the box office . To the fans , the general manager of the Brooklyn ball club is a man you can like or lump , but positively can not ignore . Nothing is sacred to MacPhail but the sanctity of baseball itself . Raucous , redheaded and ready always to needle the stuffed shirts , he criticizes bitterly the lack of imagination and intelligent effort exhibited by his associates in the National League . He has defied every hush-hush tradition of baseball diplomacy by denouncing the president of the American League . He blasts umpires with the fervor and fury of the most caustic customer . He crawls out on the limb fearlessly with wild statements and continues to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to smite him on the point of his indestructible chin . The man is as paradoxical as the official figures which show that the Dodgers , a seventh-place club last year , finished third in league attendance and increased by more than 50 per cent . the number of cash clients drawn by a sixth-place team in 1937 . He prediets the popularity of night baseball will render obsolete present . stadia with seating capacities of 70,000 and , without drawing a deep breath , tells you there must be a strict curb on the night game he introduced to the major leagues . He never has been connected with a first-division team in the major leagues , but he will sit down and name you three teams in each league which will be living up there with the quality folks fur the next ten years . A banker 's son , he insists that the capital structure of baseball must not be upset , but deplores the fact that money is stifling competition . Although he had nothing but the sketchiest college and bush-league experience as a player , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during his three years at Cincinnati than the seven other clubs combined . He bought Charley Dressen , his first hand-picked majorleague manager , for two players and cash , thereby giving precedent a good swift kick in the seat of the trousers . He can discuss such diverse subjects as a club 's potential patronage and a player 's efficiency under arc lights with equal facility and eloquence . He has a childish eagerness to be the head man of the show , but he recently approved the appointment as a Dodger coach of Bill Killefer , who once spit in his eye  --  but literally . It all adds up to the incontrovertible conclusion that Leland Stanford MacPhail is the most vigorous and progressive individual in baseball today . There 's never a dull moment in the life of MacPhail or his ball club . Things happen with the swiftness and significance typical of the stirring events which transpired during a seven-day span last June . On June fifteenth , the Dodgers played their first night . game in Brooklyn , to a capacity house . Three hours later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitched his second successive no-hit , no-run game , an achievement unparalleled in the ninety-nine-year history of baseball . On June eighteenth , 1938 , Babe Ruth returned to baseball as a Dodger coach . On June twenty-first. , 1938 , the Cincinnati Reds , a good , sound last in 1937 , advanced within a game and a half of the league-leading Giants . The large hand of MacPhail was active in shaping every one of those developments , which , with the exception of the Ruth appointment , will exert a profound influence on National League affairs for several years to come . As soon as the Yankees commenced committing interesting atrocities on the Cubs in the last World Series , the experts agreed , as one man , that the Reds would have been a better contender for the National League . Inexperience and a young team 's tendency to go haywire under pressure probably cost Cincinnati the pennant . But the Reds are strong favorites in the winter books to win in 1939 and figure to be dangerous for the next three seasons , at least . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the Reds ' spectacular rise , it . is MacPhail . He alone saw the possibilities in Frank McCormick and Vander Meer , the most celebrated youth in the country last summer , when the kids wore kicking  --  or being kicked , as the ease may be  --  around in the deep bush . Of the Reds ' fifteen most important players , MacPhail was instrumental in getting all but three  --  Lombardi , Derringer and Frey  --  for Cincinnati . The others  --  Vander Meer , McCormick , Grissom , Goodman , Moore , Schott . Davis , Craft , Myers , Gamble , Biggs , and Iiollingsworth , who went , , to the Phillies in a rnidseason deal for Walters  --  were his boys . And they say the fellow does n't know a ballplayer from Adam 's off ox . When MacPhail went . to Brooklyn , on January 20 , 1938 , as executive vice president and general manager of the Dodgers , the affairs of the best franchise in baseball were in a horrible mess . The club owed $190,000 to various major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there was a little matter of a mortgage on Ebbets Field held by the Brooklyn Trust Company . For the preceding five years the club had lost money with an ease and elegance exceeded only by the manner in which the Brooklyn athletes lost ball games . " I don't. know what would 've happened to me , " MacPhail confesses , " if the sun had n't shone on six days in April when we had three exhibitions with the Yankees and three league games with the Giants at Ebbets Field . We really were in tough shape , and no foolin ' . I already had spent fifty thousand dollars for Camilli and if I had asked for more money , somebody would 've fainted . We had to get the cash , the players ' salaries and all operating expenses at the gate , that 's how strapped we were for ready money . " Five months later , despite the installation of a $100,000 lighting system and purchases of players amounting to $214,500 , the Dodgers showed a profit For the first time since 1932 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserved no credit ; it did everything backwards , losing at home and winning on the road , with the result that it antagonized the customers everywhere . Yet . the home attendance was 750,125 , an all-time record for a seventh-place team , compared to the 482,649 drawn in 1936 . The answer ? Night baseball and L. S. IsJacPhail . Light Over Brooklyn TN SPITE of the minor miracles that MaePhail has I performed in Cincinnati and Brooklyn , he is unquestionably the most reviled and thoroughly disliked executive in baseball . They say he is an arrogant popoff , a menace to the stability of the game . They may be right and , then again , the enmity of his colleagues may be just a manifestation of a defense mechanism against the man who would throw a bombshell into a business which has not seen a fundamental change in methods for thirty-five years . Most of the opposition to MaePhail stems from his ardent promotion of night baseball . After-dark baseball did not originate with MacPhail : crude oil flares were used to illuminate the field at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installed fourteen arc lights in the Cincinnati park for an exhibition game in 1909 . The man who convinced MacPhail that night could be turned into day was Norman Perry , millionaire owner of the Indianapolis club , who also had the presence of mind to control the utility company which supplied the power for the first , modern lighting plant . MaePhail , however , did get the National League to sanction seven night games a season in 1935 , when he was at Cincinnati , and Brooklyn became the second major-league club to play under the lights at home when he took charge last year . Tho old guard insists that baseball can thrive as a sport without phony circus inducements to hold the public . It fears the night game will ruin baseball as a daytime attraction . MacPhail retorts that night baseball alone has saved organized baseball from dying of pernicious anemia . Some of the owners are so reactionary they would n't even number their players until a few years ago , " MaePhail says . " They 're being just as blind to the vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silly things that go on in league meetings , you would n't believe me . A few of these grown men , who have millions invested in a business , can waste hours grousing over how many Sundays they lost on account of rain or how many games the umpires cost them . But they have n't time to listen to a constructive report . They shelve it and go back into the same old song and dance . " They do n't seem to realize that the fundamental problem in baseball today is not the weather , the umpires or even night baseball . It 's the development of ballplayers . Under the present setup there are eight clubs in the major leagues which never will he able to break the monopoly on new playing talent held by the Yankees and Cardinals . The entire system is cockeyed . " Rivalry made baseball in the beginning , and the game was built up in the sticks , where it was town against town and every game had the element of a community brawl . There was real competition then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's got . to be equal . But is it ? Do n't make me laugh . " I can tell you right now six teams that will be buried in the second division for the next ten years , if there 's no change . All right , you asked for it . The Phillies , Athletics , Browns , Bees , Senators , and maybe the White Sox . 1 ca n't toll you which teams will win , but remember this . The 1943 major-league pennants were decided in the minors last . season , and practically all the good prospects were owned by those teams that have been finishing one-two-three in the last five years . " Let 's quit this generalizing and get down to facts . There were thirty-seven minor leagues in existence last year . Figure each league averaged seven teams and the average number of players on each team was sixteen . All right ; that 's four thousand one hundred arid forty-four potential major-leaguers . Immediately forget about twenty-five hundred of them . They have n't a chance to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forty-four , I 'll venture to say two clubs , the Yankees and Cardinals , control more than one thousand  --  and most of the good ones . " Time out , please . There were fifteen teams in the Yankee organization last year . Nine finished first in their respective leagues and only one , Joplin , in the Western Association , failed to get into championship play-offs . The Yankees ' Poor Relations AFTER the Yankees had routed the Cubs in four straight games to capture their third successive world championship and their farm teams at Newark and Kansas City had concluded the Little World Series , the idea was broached gently to Ed Barrow , the directing genius of the organization , that the Yankees should he disbanded deliberately before they killed of competition and interest . " Preposterous ! " Barrow fumed . " Why should we lower the standard of baseball ? Let the other clubs build up to our level . Anybody can do what we 've accomplished if they 're willing to spend the time and effort . " How about . it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital facts . He or anybody with half an eye can see that two thirds of the clubs are in no financial position to own or operate such a system . Look at the Phillies . They did n't have a single major-league prospect out on option last year , and even if they had picked up one , they would n't have been able to place him , because they had no farm tie-up . It costs money to run a chain-store system . More money than all but a handful of teams have . " Listen . During my first year at Cincinnati I brought thirteen rookies into the big league , and twelve stuck . That 's a swell average , but I happened to be lucky . And it 's not so good as it sounds , because Barrow could have put twice as many new players on the Yankees . He could afford to let them mature and improve in the minors , because he did n't need them immediately . We offered fifteen thousand dollars in cash for Joe Gordon after he had played one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down cold . They wore looking ahead two and three years . " I can see the next question coming . Why did the Cardinals , who have an older and larger farm system than the Yankees , finish sixth ? Because the Cards have sold seven hundred thousand dollars ' worth of ballplayers in the last six years . Hold on ; I 'm way out of line . I was in their organization ? for three years and we never failed to sell at least two hundred thousand dollars in players every year . Make that figure more than a million dollars . Dizzy Dean alone brought one hundred and eighty-five thousand dollars . " And why did the Cards unload those players ? Because they ca n't draw upon a tremendous population , such as the Yankees have , to support a great team . They must sell players to balance the deficits piled up by their farms . I 'm not familiar with all the players in the National League , but giving the rosters of last year a quick once-over , I can name thirty-three players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If they had been able to keep those players , the Cards would dominate the National League more completely than the Yankees do the American League . " Very interesting , to he sure , but when does night baseball enter the picture as a solution to this distressing state of affairs ? " This is a long , complicated story and I 'm doing the best I can . We 're practically there , anyway . " Two possible courses of action are open . The discrepancy in playing material , which is becoming more obvious every year , can be eliminated partially by changing a rule of organized baseball . I mean the draft rule . Instead of limiting the draft to one player from each minor-league team , make it legal to draft two or three . And limit the number of minor-league clubs each major-league team can control . " How the Draft Works " A brief explanation may be necessary . Under the present system , the major-league teams convene for the draft meeting during the World Series . All minor leaguers not . owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the reverse order of the final standings . That is , the Phillies , who finished eighth last year in the National League , had first crack at any unattached minor leaguer they chose to buy for $7500 . Then the Browns , eighth in the American League , had their pick of the list . But no more than One player can be drafted from any minor-league team . No more than forty players can be included on a major-league roster before the limit of twenty-five players becomes effective on May eighteenth , but the number of men a major-league team can send out on option or can own indirectly through a farm-team affiliate is unlimited . " Competition is so cockeyed that after the majors drafted last October , the higher minor leagues drafted only six players from lower leagues . Think of it ! Six unattached players available in about two thousand . Most of the others were tied up by a major-league team . " That 's the solution for free and equal competition , but it never will be done . Nobody can cause an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I really ca n't blame the rich owners for refusing to sanction such a plan . They have a tremendous investment in players and farm teams . You ca n't expect them to junk it just to help the weak sisters . " What 's the answer , then ? Making the Turnstiles Click " Night baseball . That 's the biggest step in the right direction . That alone will supply poor teams with the capital they need to buy an occasional player and operate a few farms , anyway . And it 's the only working method I know that will reduce the enormous differences in potential patronage which exist today . Even if all other factors were equal , towns like New York , Chicago , Boston and Brooklyn would hold a crushing advantage and we 'd have unbalanced competition all over again . " Compare Brooklyn and Washington , for example . A had ball club will draw a half million people at home in Brooklyn . In Washington it 'll draw a quarter of a million . A good team in Brooklyn will draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a difference of two hundred thousand dollars a year at the gate , and a million dollars in five years . It mounts up in a hurry . " That 's why night baseball was absolutely necessary in Cincinnati , which has the smallest population in the major leagues . The lights meant a difference of four hundred thousand dollars in four years to the Reds ; money they never would 've made otherwise . And it . began to show on the field last season . " Frankly , Brooklyn does n't need night baseball . We have a potential million-dollar gate every year , but we need the team to draw it . We did n't have the team last year and we may not have it next year , but we will in time . Just give us time . Night baseball meant an extra hundred thousand dollars to us in 1938 , and every penny was put back into new players . " The next question never fails to lift MacPhail out of his corner , swinging from the floor . Why , then , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leagues for four years ? " No intelligent effort , " he barks . " Some of the owners think they have nothing to worry about as long as they draw crowds of seventy thousand four or five times a year . Night baseball can make seventy thousand people look like a quiet Monday crowd in Philadelphia . If certain engineering problems can be overcome and ball parks can be built to accommodate two hundred thousand spectators , night baseball in the majors will fill them . Sounds screwy , doesn't. it ? " When I was at Michigan , eighteen thousand at old Ferry Field for a Michigan-Minnesota football game was considered a helluva crowd . I notice Michigan drew eighty thousand in its opener with Michigan State last year . A traditional big-time game could 66 outsell the capacity of any stadium three times over if the football people did not charge such outrageous prices . " Football has prospered because it has dressed up the production , has tried to appeal to the general public by smart promotion . Sure , night baseball is a spectacle with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want . Baseball under Lights looks more glamorous , colorful . Take the footlights away from a chorus line and the costumes look drab and the girls are n't half so attractive . The same principle applies to night baseball . The uniforms look better , the players look faster and bigger , and the fans react accordingly . " I 've tried to tell the owners they are n't even scratching the surface of their potential audience . I 've spent three years and a couple of thousand dollars taking surveys , which show that the average fan sees five games a season . If the home team is bad , he will pay for only three games , and if it 's a pennant-winning team , he will see as many as twelve games . " The question is : How many of those fans does a ball club have ? In Brooklyn last year we had about one hundred and fifty thousand regular clients . Our roof , though , is five hundred thousand , if we can get them out . Radio will help ; constant plugging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cincinnati . Night baseball gave general interest another shot in the arm . Cincinnati , the smallest town in the majors , will be a strong factor in the National League as long as the other clubs neglect their potential audiences . " Although the American League was the only league in the country which did not play night baseball until this season , it has devoted a more intelligent effort to improve its teams . It may be treason for me to say so , but it 's the truth . You have the Yankees , Red Sox , Cleveland and Detroit building for the future . Even the Browns have tried. - Pros and Cons of Night Work " In the National League , the Cardinals and Reds alone have made that intelligent effort in recent years . No wonder we 've looked bad in World Series . The Cubs , Pirates and Giants , the three top teams , have n't any farm systems worth mentioning . That 's why the Dodgers finished only eighteen and a half games out of first place last season , the smallest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was n't a case of the weak teams improving . The basic reason was that the league is getting weaker from the top down . " Now , I 'm not advocating night baseball as a panacea for everything that ails the business . But it will put weak clubs on their feet again from a competitive angle . In fact , I 'm not particularly crazy about night baseball . I believe it should not be played more than once a week , even in the hick towns that need it to survive . " The ultimate decision will not be made by me or any other executive . Public opinion eventually will force all clubs to play at night , but there never will be more than seven games a season in the majors . We have a constitutional amendment which requires a unanimous vote to increase the number of games , and I , for one , would vote against that proposal . There 's a limit to the amount of money a fan can be expected to spend . " Opponents of night baseball say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traction in the minors . That 's largely true , and it 's a shame . But I will say this : Without night baseball you would n't have had thirty-seven minor leagues last year . The minors would have died long ago and the majors would have followed soon after . " This tornado on the horizon of baseball was no larger than a man 's hand when it first appeared at Cass City , Michigan , where MaoPhail was born to a banking family on February 3 , 1890 . He went to school at Detroit and Ludington , and in 1905 first encountered Bill Killefer , who later became Grover Cleveland Alexander 's famous battery partner . First baseman MacPhail 's Ludington team played Catcher Killefer 's Paw-Paw gang for the high-school championship of Michigan , and Ludington won . " That 's the only time in my long experience that a crooked umpire ever robbed me of a game , " Killefer howled , when MacPhail gave him a job thirtythree years later . In 1907 , MacPhail , playing for Beloit College , again crossed bats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The teams were locked in an epic struggle when MacPhail went to bat with two out in the ninth , with runners on second and third and Sacred Heart leading , 2-1 . The count reached two and two , the pitcher wound up , MacPhail took a toehold and " Kinder squirted tobacco juice through his mask right into my eye , " the outraged MaePhail relates . " The stuff blinded me and a fast ball right down the middle went by for strike three and the ball game . Killefer ducked before I could see straight . Lucky for him . I would 've brained him with the bat . " EVENING POST The belligerents did not meet again until 1930 , when Columbus , of the American Association , played the St. Louis Browns , managed by Killefer , in an exhibition game at West Palm Beach . MacPhail , the dignified president of Columbus , devoted the entire afternoon bellowing at Killefer : " Where did you get that bunch of semipros ? " while Columbus was winning . " Milder , without a doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacPhail says blandly , " but he 's a good guy and a smart baseball man . That 's why he was hired as a Dodger coach . " Some sons of wealthy men make the grand tour after college ; MaePhail varied the procedure by making a grand tour while he was in college . He attended Beloit , the University of Michigan and George Washington University , tarrying in each temple of learning for two years until he got his law degree at George Washington . During the summer he played professional baseball under an assumed name to remain eligible for varsity sports . " I thought I was just a fair player , " he says , " but maybe I was wrong . In 1907 I played in the Southern Michigan Association and hit .282 . A fellow by the name of Landry led the league with .297 . The point , though , is that Fred Merkle hit .271 that same season and was bought by the Giants for seven hundred and fifty dollars . Merkle did all right in the National League . " MacPhail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , then became credit manager for several concerns , and at twenty-seven was president of a large department store in Nashville . Came the war , and MacPhail , a gent of rampant enthusiasms March 4.19 " manadiminpuls impulses , was captain B n and com- ndg officer of in the 114th Field Artillery , a Tennessee outfit . After the Armistice was signed , our hero was one of the eight Americans who tried to kidnap the Kaiser , as reported in THE SATURDAY NYE NINO POST in 1937 , a bold , unauthorized adventure which was narrowly frustrated . Returned to civilian life , MaePhail was associated with a glass company in Columbus , and was getting along famously when , for no particular reason , he suddenly decided to buy the franchise of the local team in the American Association . Superficially , the decision did not redound to his acumen . The purchase was consummated in the teeth of the depression , Columbus had finished a hopeless last the previous season and the ball club had more creditors in good voice than good will . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball clubs that have more sheriffs than pitchers , " he comments ruefully . " Eight years in the , business and I have n't started yet with a team in the black or close to the first division . Columbus was eighth , Cincinnati was threatening to fall right out of the league , and Brooklyn owed everybody and his cousin . " Baseball 's In-and , Outer It has been said that MaePhail could sell sun lamps in darkest equatorial Africa , which may be a bit of overstatement . He has , however , the knack of turning on the charm and selling himself to astute gentlemen who are not in the habit of succumbing easily to high-pressure salesmanship . Shortly after buying the Columbus club , MacPhail sought player help from Branch Rickey , major-domo of the Cardinals ' far-flung baseball empire and by common agreement the shrewdest trader in the business . Thirty days later MacPhail sold Columbus to the Cardinals at . a profit and remained as executive president . In the fall of 1933 he was summoned by the Central Trust Company , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months later MacPhail had persuaded Powel Crosley , the radio tycoon , to buy . the club , with himself the general manager . He resigned in 1936 ? some disagreement over the amount of stock he was supposed to get  --  and returned to the family banking house . The Brooklyn Trust Company lured him back into baseball , but only after the original offer was bettered to meet MaePhail 's demand for a free hand with the Dodgers and a three-year contract , which was extended at the conclusion of the 1938 season . " Those reports that I took the job for fifteen or twenty thousand dollars a year wore ridiculous , " MacPhail snorts . " Hell , I was making much more in the banking business , and I 'd be an awful sucker to get into this mess for less dough . I came in as the highest-paid executive in the league after Rickey . " This revelation , which is nobody 's business but MacPhail 's , is significant . Rickey is the undisputed No. 1 frontoffice master-mind of the National League , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heir apparent . Although their prescriptions for sick ball clubs are much the same , the personalities and methods of the men are the antithesis of each other . Rickey is fond of the flowery , orotund speech , a calculating spellbinder who achieves his purpose through indirection and innuendo . MacPhail is // as subtle as a punch in the nose ; the man has a positive genius for getting himself into untenable positions with plain and fancy speaking-out , then emerging safely by the sheer aggressiveness and violence of his attack . Both can wade into a chaotic situation and restore some semblance of order , and both have an enormous capacity for work , but even the indefatigable Rickey sometimes is astonished by the furious activity of the redheaded dynamo . MacPhail travels by plane almost exclusively and once kept a log of the distance he had flown , but he abandoned it two years ago , when it reached 250,000 miles . He believes he made the first commercial flight in this country , a short hop from Tampa to St. Petersburg in 1915 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first major-league manager he selected personally , is typical of his operations . Three men were under consideration to succeed Bob O'Farrell , who left Cincinnati in midseason of 1934 . MacPhail flew to Indianapolis to observe Wade Killefer , Bill 's brother , barged on to Los Angeles to have a look-see at Oscar Vitt , then raced to Atlanta , where Dressen 's Nashville team was playing . The Dodgers ' Harvest Moon He decided on Dressen , but failed to swing a deal for Charley 's immediate release . An hour after he narrowly missed cracking up at the Cincinnati airport , MacPhail received a longdistance phone call . Nashville 's firststring catcher had just broken his leg and a replacement was needed badly . MacPhail replied he would be delighted to send along Jack Crouch , his thirdstring backstop , if the Nashville management was willing to listen to reason on the Dressen proposition . MacPhail was in the driver 's seat and knew it . He threw Walter Hitcher , a pitcher , and $5000 into the deal , and two days later , Dressen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikes on MacPhail when he went to Brooklyn last winter . It always is open season in New York for taking pot shots at the hapless Dodgers , and the directors were charged with attempting to divert attention from the fact that they had a pretty awful ball club by bringing in MacPhail , a good showman , until the ball game got under way . He was dubbed " Larry MacPhailure " ; he was accused of undermining the authority of Manager Burleigh Grimes before he hung up his hat in the office . It was remembered that , infuriated by Pitcher Paul Derringer 's neglect to slide home with the winning run , he once dashed into the press box and announced a $200 fine had been slapped on the villain before he informed Dressen . Giant correspondents recalled MaePliairs attempt to bar them from the dugouts at Crosley Field and the turbulent argument which followed . The chief objection , as always , was the certainty that he would introduce night baseball in Brooklyn , It seems that all parties concerned are violently opposed to night baseball , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nocturnal contests at Ebbets Field last season drew 189,765 paid admissions . It is freely conceded by one and all that the same games , played during the day , would not have attracted more than 30,000 . Four years of experimentation in Cincinnati have proved that night games outdraw the exercises in broad daylight by a 10-to-1 margin . The common belief that ballplaYers do n't like to play at night is largely the bunk , " MacPhail adds . " Sure , a lot of them crab . I had one hundred and ninety-three men in my Army outfit , and there were a. couple of chronic cranks who always thought the food was lousy . Ballplayers are the same way , always finding fault with the hotel , the Pullmans , working conditions , or something . But they 're just like actors and kids . They love the crowds , the color and the excitement . " A few years ago I asked Dizzy Dean point-blank about night ball . ' Mr. MacPhail , ' he answered , ' anybody who wants to pitch in the heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool . ' One afternoon in Cincinnati we had a thermometer in the dugout , and it hit one hundred and twenty-eight degrees . It 's always ten to fifteen degrees cooler at night , " The theory that it 's impossible to play good mechanical baseball at night is another fallacy . Fielding averages are uniformly higher at night because the backgrounds are better and there are no shadows cast by the sun , and batting averages are only slightly lower . It 's also said that night baseball ruins young players for the daytime . What about all those great rookies the Yankees are bringing up ? It does n't seem to hurt them . Ninety per cent of all minor-league baseball is being played at night . And do n't forget minor-league lighting systems admittedly are inadequate . They ca n't begin to compare with the plants in Cincinnati and Brooklyn , and improvements are being made so fast that the next setup will make ours look like a couple of Roman candles . " MacPhail 's weakness for rushing to press with a statement on the slightest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Dodgers . When asked in a preseason poll to predict where the team would finish , Burleigh Grimes , the manager and another frank and fearless citizen , guessed the final resting place would be seventh . MacPhail almost hit the roof . " I do n't think Manager Grimes or anybody else knows where the Dodgers are going to finish , " MacPhail stormed in type . " If our ball club on May fifteenth is n't better than a seventhplace club , we 'll proceed to get rid of that club and build another one . " Hasty Words Come Home to Roost New York newspapers have a nasty habit of filing away such pronouncements and confronting the authors with same on the appointed date . On the evening of May fifteenth the Dodgers were in seventh place . MacPhail was reminded of his promise for rebuilding the team . It smacked of a dirty trick , for the Dodgers had been sixth until they lost a tough 10-7 game to the Bees that very afternoon . " I said the Dodgers would be ripped apart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club , " MacPhail protested shrilly . " I 'm not convinced . We 've had bad breaks , we 're bound to improve ? " and so on , far into the night , with frequent accusations that he had been misquoted . The Dodgers proved to be as inept us ever during the early months of the season , but MacPhail endeared himself to the Brooklyn constituents by tearing into the haughty Giants with a withering blast unequaled since the time of Uncle Robbie . The overweening civic pride which agitates the breast of a Dodger fan when his beloved Brooklyns beat the ears off the Giants is no exaggerated gag . On July twelfth the Dodgers , after dropping ten straight games to the Giants , finally defeated the despised New Yorks . That same evening Robert Joyce shot and fatally wounded Frank H. Krug and William J. Diamond in a bar because the victims jocularly referred to the Dodgers as " a bunch of bums . " MaePhail , therefore , became the people 's choice when he landed a haymaker on the exposed chin the Giants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been let for the installation of his lighting system , the Giants charged 1148ePhail with breach of promise and mentioned an agreement among the three New York clubs which was supposed to ban night baseball from the metropolitan district . MaePhail leaped to the attack with a vitriolic pen . The Retort Discourteous " Giant oflieials , notably Treasurer Leo Bondy , are voicing open resentment of Larry MacPhail 's action in pulling the Dodgers out of a threecornered pact with the Giants and Yankees opposing night baseball , " he declared in an open letter to the press . " The directors of the Brooklyn Club advise me there was no contract , pact or understanding of any kind , nature or description with the Giants or Yankees regarding night baseball . " If Mr. Bondy can tell us where we can get a couple of pitchers , we would appreciate his assistance . Otherwise , we suggest that he confine his efforts to running the Giants . " The only ' pact ' my directors know anything about is an understanding engineered by Mr. Bondy several years ago that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of baseball games . " The day of Brooklyn 's first night game , Bill Terry was asked whether he would be among those present at Ebbets Field . " I might go over to see that Jesse Owens run , " Terry said casually . Owens , Olympic sprint champion , was one of the pre-game features of the program . Again MacPhail charged into action with loud , gladsome cries . " Five years ago the New York Giants , under the able leadership of Col. William H. Terry , made baseball history by engaging in the first night baseball game in New York in which a major-league club appeared . The Giants at that time requested the Brooklyn club to allow them to play a night baseball game in Brooklyn against a semipro club . The Brooklyn club gave its consent . The Giants received $1000 for playing the game . It is fitting that an individual who pioneered night baseball in New York should be honored when a major-league club again plays a night baseball game in Brooklyn . We are therefore extending a cordial invitation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an honored guest . " Quiet , please . Men at work. , blasting . " The son-of-a-gun was right too , " Terry admitted . " Only we got fifteen hundred dollars for playing the Bushwicks . " MaePhail took a bad beating from the Giants on the subject of broadeaat , ing the Dodgers home games , until ho piped down the snipers with documentary evidence which made thorn look extremely silly . In 1934 , the Giants , Yankees and Dodgers entered a five-year agreement to ban broadcasting from New York ball parks . Stephen W. McKeever , Brooklyn 's president and signatory to the pact , died six weeks after MaePhail entered the picture . MaePhail asked to be released from the agreement , in view of the circumstances . The Giants soon thereafter began to hurl charges of breach of faith all over the place . Early iu December , at the minor-league meeting in New Orleans , MaePhail sold the broadcasting rights at Ebbets Field to two commercial sponsors for a sum believed to be in the neighborhood of $90,000 . On the same day MaePhail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leo Bondy for the Giants and Ed Barrow for the Yankees , dated July fourteenth and July fifteenth . Late in January identical announcements were issued to the press through Secretary Eddie Brannick , of the Giants , and George Perry , of the Yankees , that definite arrangements had been made for broadeastingall Giant and Yankee home games , Sunday games excepted , during the coming season . At the major-league meetings in New York , the last organization opposed to night baseball capitulated when the American League gave Cleveland and Philadelphia permission to play seven games a season . Paradoxically enough , the Giants , the only National League team which has refused to participate in games after dark , were the immediate cause for the action which made MacPhail 's agitation for night baseball a complete triumph . The Giants were interested in getting Zeke Bonura , the muscular first baseman , from Washington , and Clark Griffith was intrigued mightily by the $20,000 the Giants were willing to lay on the line for the player . Before Bonura could be shifted from the American to the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get waivers in its own organization . Cleveland and Philadelphia claimed the player for the intra-league waiver price of $7500 , much to the anguish of Griffith . Both clubs intimated , though , the claims would be withdrawn if Griffith would vote in favor of night baseball , which the American League had declined to sanction in 1937 by a narrow margin . Griffith , an old-guard conservative , swung his vote over to the arc-light faction and got his $20,000 . The Giants got Bonura , the American League got night baseball and MaePhail chalked up another on the scoreboard or the ( 1iant-Dodger feud . " The Leakof the League " Terry calls MacPhail other things , among them " The Leak of the League , " a reference to the Brooklyn executive 's habit of revealing confidential news and bulletins . When the Giants bought Bob Seeds , the minor-league home-run king , from Newark for $40,000 , MaePhail confided that the player had been peddled for $12,500 to all National League clubs except the Giants and Cubs . He predicted out loud that Alex Kampouris would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Terry acquired the second baseman in a trade with Cincinnati , and he told newspapermen that Terry was trying to waive Johnny McCarthy and Sam Leslie , his first basemen , out of the league . MaePhail spiked the effort by claiming both McCarthy and Leslie , although he had two first basemen in Camilli passing , Ilassett on his pay roll . In it might be mentioned that 70 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST Ai arch 4. , 4 ? ' MacPhail 's information was correct in every detail . The pay-off , however , came at the last World Series . MacPhail had been dickering to buy Russ Evans , Nashville pitcher , but Terry topped his bid by offering $10,000 . But Terry pulled a technical blunder in putting Evans on the Jersey City , instead of the Giant , roster , which made the player eligible for the draft . MacPbail caught the mistake , claimed Evans and got him for $7500 , all of which meant that the Giants were out $2500 and a pitcher . Terry was enraged by the barefaced , but legal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair . " I have no feud with Terry , " MaePhail says , with a disarming grin . " I think Bill is the best manager in the league and , as a matter of fact , I suggested him as my successor when I left Cincinnati . There are two things wrong with the guy , and I told him so to his face when we got into that jam over Evans . " ' The trouble with you , Terry , ' I said , ' is that . you never could take it and you 're on the way to the second division and it 's burning hell out of you . ' I thought he 'd throw a fit . " MacPhail in turn burns briskly when he is called the " Barnum of Baseball , " a southpaw compliment of his showmanship . He would rather be known as a latter-day David Ilitrum and likes to tell how he converted Burgess Whitehead from a bad shortstop into a topnotch second baseman ; how he nursed Johnny Vander Meer through the minors ; that he predicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to turn thumbs down on Mize because the Reds could not gamble to the extent of $55,000 on a player with a bad leg ; how he got Frank McCormick for a postage stamp , then stuck with the boy who was the league 's outstanding rookie last year , when he was turned down by six minor-league teams in one season . The personal prestige MacPhail had built up in Brooklyn by diligeet heckling of the Giants and the purchase of Dolf Camilli for $50,000 ? the secondlargest. cash expenditure for a player in Dodger history  --  very nearly was torn down by the Babe Ruth affair . For three years fans and factotums had been agreeing it was a darn shame baseball had no place for good old Babe . Then MacPhail suddenly and dramatically announced the appointment of Ruth as a Dodger coach . Along Came Ruth It was not the first time MacPhail had tried to give Ruth a job . In 1934 , when Babe was still with the Yankees , MacPhail had Ruth under consideration for manager of the Reds before Dressen was selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruppert never would permit Babe to leave the American League , a development which came to pass , of course , the next year when Ruth went to the Boston Bees . Bringing Ruth back to an active role in baseball was a tremendously popular gesture , but . MacPhail 's motives were more realistic than sentimental . " Ruth helped the Dodgers as no other man could have , " MacPhail admits . " The morale of the ball club was shot . Grimes and Andy High , his coach , had just had a scrap on the bench . After Vander Meer 's no-hit , norun game , we lost a double-header to the Reds , and the next day I knew the fans had quit cold on us when we drew only three thousand one hundred with the Cubs on a perfect Saturday . I hadto take in one hundred and forty-eight thousand dollars at the gate en that ght home stand , and something drastic had to be done in a hurry . Ruth was the only way out . " Although Ruth was paid $15,000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for three and a half months , Brooklyn realized a profit on the investment . The first day Babe appeared in uniform on the coaching lines , 20,000 customers paid their way into Ebbets Field . MacPhail is the first to concede that Ruth personally was responsible for at least 17,000 admissions on that day alone . The Dodgers played seven exhibition games after Ruth was appointed , and attracted 49,400 . MacPhail admits that the Dodgers , without Ruth , would have played only three exhibitions which might have drawn 12,000 . And it is impossible to estimate the number of extra spectators pulled through the turnstiles by Ruth on his first swing around the National League . A Managerial Mix  --  Up The man in the street was not concerned , though , with how much money Ruth or the Dodgers made from the alliance . He cared only that the Great Man could be seen in a monkey suit knocking an occasional ball over the fence in batting practice and was in a position to realize his lifelong ambition  --  to manage a major-league club . The intriguing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1939 was engendered by the knowledge that Leo Durocher , captain and shortstop of the team , was among those present at the midnight conference when Ruth was signed . Reporters promptly guessed out loud that Ruth , who has n't the patience or talent for handling the multitudinous details which bedevil a manager , would succeed Grimes , with Durocher , a smart , personable citizen , the field general behind the scenes . MacPhail immediately spiked that random rumor with an unmistakably clear statement for publication : " Ruth was told he never would be considered as a candidate for manager of the Dodgers . Durocher was told the same thing . " Durocher was the kickback in the resultant rumpus . Three days after the World Series ended , Durocher was made manager of the Dodgers , much to the surprise of nobody at all . The appointment of Lippy Leo had been predicted , once it became apparent that the Dodgers would not do well enough to save Grimes ' job and that the Babe was not prominent in the strategy of the ball club on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coach in a simultaneous announcement . In response to a direct question , Durocher blandly explained that Ruth was " unavailable " for 1939 . That " unavailable " gag was a bit too thick . No overtures had been made to Babe by another club and everybody knew he had nothing but golf to occupy the shining afternoon hours . MacPhail was accused of using Ruth for crass commercial purposes , then discarding him like an old shoe . Durocher was condemned for undermining the man who improved the lot of every ballplayer . All the ammunition was on the side of the opposition , and MacPilaff and Durocher were tethered in the doghouse until the former clarified the entire mess . " The statement that Ruth was unavailable was made at his own request , " MacPhail said . " Maybe I should have told the reporters that , to take the rap off Duroeher , but he had the floor when the question was popped and he answered it in the only honest way . " Since Ruth did not bother to refute the statement , it undoubtedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gossip that Ruth and Duroeher had tangled in a fist fight in the clubhouse a few weeks before the close of the season . Under those circumstances it hardly was logical for Ruth to serve as a subordinate to the man who was a rookie on the Yankees in 1928 when he was at the very peak of his career . MacPhail , when reminded of his flat statement to the effect that Durocher never would be manager of the Dodgers , retorted that unforeseen conditions forced him to renege , and that 's all there was to it . Despite his bard-boiled attitude , MacPhail is just a fan at heart . He was one of the nation 's leading football officials for ten years , but he will denounce the decisions of umpires  --  especially when they go against his team ? with a vehemence and virtuosity seldom heard from the customers in the cheap seats . Yet his concept of baseball is on a lofty plane far above the sordid scrambling in the market place . " I like to think of the game as a semi-civic enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more amateur spirit and sportsmanship in professional baseball than there is in intercollegiate athletics . History shows that few owners have ever made a profit from the game , but the losses are overwhelming . The best that men like Ruppert , Yawkey , Wrigley and Briggs can hope to make is bare expenses , if that . " There 's not another sport that can offer such absolute proof of honesty as baseball has shown in the recent World Series . I know for a fact that Stoneham ordered Hubbell to be pitched out of turn in the ' 33 series , even though winning the game meant losing a Sunday date in New York . And look at the Yankees , returning one hundred and fifty thousand dollars in cash for tickets already sold when they won four straight from the Cubs last year . Nobody in the world would 've criticized Joe McCarthy if he had not come back with Ruffing in the fourth game , but Colonel Ruppert was n't thinking of the money . He wanted that championship . It 's the cleanest , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a soft spot in his heart for his chosen profession . But not in his head .
