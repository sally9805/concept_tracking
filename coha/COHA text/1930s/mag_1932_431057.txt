 | I HAVE just come back from the largest burial ground of dead loves in the world ? the little town where six days of every week disillusioned men and women admit to the world that their marriages have failed , and free themselves from the bonds that have become hateful to them . I have sat in the courtroom while every ten minutes another story has been told , another man or woman restored to the status of an unmarried person . I have heard every type , every age , every nationality , every race , and every creed tell haltingly or tearfully , or in rarer instances , coldly and bitterly , the story of his wrecked happiness . I have talked with them . I have talked , too , with their lawyers and with the judges , who , despite the commonplaceness of these stories in their lives , still seem to have an understanding and a sympathy for the heartache behind each of them . I went to visit this town , not out of curiousity , not with the expectation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for legalizing immorality , but because Reno is a clearing house for human misery . I went there to get material for an article , not on divorce , but on marriage . I went there to see from the reverse what was wrong with the picture . I felt that there , where one hears so constantly and clearly why marriage has failed , I might learn what could be done ? or avoided ? to make it succeed . And , in my stay in Reno , I did learn many things about that . But , first of all , I learned the difference between a divorce colony as it is pictured in the movies and the popular magazines , and the colony as it really is . For despite the steady line of swinging lights announcing this club and that ; despite the brilliant sign which , flung across the main street , proclaims this " The Biggest Little City in the World " ; despite open gambling , from the fashionable Willows outside the tows to the slot machines that ' beguile the ' nickels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parlor ; despite the innumerable speakeasies that  | make little pretense of hiding behind their peep-hole doors ? underneath and behind all is stark individual tragedy . Like most real tragedy , it does not show on the surface , but the faintest scratch beneath that surface leaves one stirred and saddened ? . makes one understand why , among the fine men and women who are the permanent residents of Reno , there is no intolerance , no smug judging of their temporary residents . Constant and intimate contact with the men and women who sign the sixweeks leases on the kitchenette apartments that abound throughout the town , or who sit about the numerous cheap boarding-house tables or in the expensive restaurants , has taught them that few people break their marriage ties lightly , that most of them come to this little town , set down amidst its breath-taking beauty of mountains and lakes , only at the end of a long emotional strain . This was apparent to me , too , from the beginning . The first case I heard was that of a boy hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia , to , whom he had been married less than a year , had one day left him ? and had never let herself be heard from again . He was still bewildered , and there was a deep hurt in his voice and eyes as he told his story . Immediately after him came a man , whose marriage had begun thirty-five years ago , long before the boy had been born into this disappointing world . Calmly , but with deep feeling , he told how his wife had walked out of his home some twenty years previous , and how , though he had followed her to the ends of the earth , she had refused to come back to him or to give him any reason for desertion . A girl followed him . She bore a mirthprovoking resemblance to a cartoon , and she answered the questions indifferently , without any show of feeling . Yet , when she passed me on her way from the courtroom , there was a dark flush under her skin , and her hands were tightly clenched . Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been a trained nurse . Haltingly and in a trembling voice she told a tale of unbelievable cruelty , long endured . " Could you have gone on living with him , and enjoyed health and happiness ? " asked the Judge mechanically . " Oh , no , " she exclaimed , looking up with terror in her haunted eyes . And she , like the others , was speedily restored to her unmarried tatus . The wheels ground on , stopping only occasionally while the Judge retired to his chambers to perform a marriage ! First there were routine @#  | questions of the resident witness as to how long he had known the complainant , whether he could swear that he or she had been " personally present " in Reno every day of the required six weeks ; then the same questions were asked of the complainant , who ? perhaps with his bags packed and his ticket bought for the East  - -  swore that he had come to Reno with the intention of making it his permanent home , and that that intention still remained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes , and about financial arrangements and provision for children , all of which , in these uncontested cases , had been arranged in advance . Then the complainant left the courtroom a free man or woman . So the morning went on until the tragedy of it was almost more than I could bear . There was occasional light in the gloom the woman who complained that her husband had " a superior complex " ? the case of Love vs . Love ? the residence witness who had obviously been planning for weeks her costume and headdress for this , her day in court ? the man who solemnly replied to the Judge 's question as to his occupation that he was working in a gambling house the case of Nutt vs . Nutt ? the fuzzy blonde telephone operator who made what she would call " passes " at the Judge . But these bright spots were few and far between , and I left court that first day knowing that however I may have felt in the past , I now understood why a distinguished American had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts , that Reno was the last stand of liberty in this country . For much as we may feel that whom God bath joined together no man should put asunder , when we hear a decent-looking man tell in a low , shamed voice how the wife with whom he had hoped to establish a home had refused to have children because she feared they would interfere with the round of sports and society which filled her life , we know that the Judge is right in giving that man a second chance to find a woman who will make him a home . We know that he and his wife were joined not by God , but by a cruel joke of a cruel Nature . When we hear a woman tell the Judge how she had begged her husband not to go on with his trade of bootlegging because it was such a bad example to the children whom she " was trying to bring up right " ; when we hear her say that she finally left him because he started to initiate the older boy into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just God had not meant that woman to be indissolubly bound to that man , to sacrifice her children 's lives as well as her own in remaining with him . AND so , when I had spent sufficient time in the courtroom to be able to disentangle my mind from my emotions , to think clearly about these tragedies that were being acted out before me , I began to analyze which marriages . had been doomed to failure from the beginning and why , which homes might have been saved and how . I felt that if I could do this ; if I could make people see what I saw , hear what I-heard , feel what I felt , tempered perhaps by the opinions and judgments of those to whom custom makes this a less upsetting emotional experience than it was to me , I might accomplish something constructive in the midst of all this destruction . - One of the judges had said to me : " If you can make every boy and girl about to enter into marriage see the end for some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lost hopes filing by my bench , I do believe they will pause before entering lightly into it , before contracting a marriage that can not succeed ; if you can show every man and woman in whose married lives the little things are beginning to pile up into a non-traversable mountain of misunderstanding , the similarity in these shipwrecked marriages to certain trends in their own situations , I do . believe they may make a real effort to check them ; if you can make them hear others testify to the perhaps greater injustices and sufferings that they have borne , they may make up their minds that their own grievances are not so bad , and determine to try once more ; if you can somehow make for every license bureau and every lawyer 's office a picture of the divorce court as it really is , I believe something will have been accomplished toward greater forbearance in marriage , and so toward more contented , happy homes . " Nearly every one wants to make his marriage a success . If we omit that small and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any relationship of life , the light-minded ones to whom nothing is serious except the achieving of the next thrill , and those who are too insensitive to be unhappy , too stupid or frivolous to be saved , we still have left the long procession of those who set out on the sea of matrimony with high hopes and resolutions , faith and ideals , only to see their little hark dashed against the rocks before they know that it is in danger , before they have been warned so that they may try to save it . SHAT happened between the day that they went so happily and hopefully to the altar to merge their lives , and the one when they came before a judge to have them unbound ? What is it that happens to people so devastating that it changes from love to hate the feeling they have for each other , changes their entire life pattern ? The cruelties , the desertions , the infidelities they report are not the real causes . Every divorce judge knows that legal grounds for divorce are one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has given the subject serious study knows , too , that the psychological reasons given and believed to be the basis for unhappiness are themselves often not the real ones . These things could not have occurred except as the result of something deeper , more fundamental , something that probably those whose lives have been ruined by it would not recognize . For after a time no difference , no misunderstanding , no quarrel reflects just the episode itself . It is made up of the accumulation of all the little grievances and hurts , expressed and unexpressed , of all the previous differences and misunderstandings and quarrels . When this has happened , the quarrel is no longer an isolated , misery-bearing episode , but part of a state of resentment or indiffe=ante which has become chronic . What is it that causes these things that in time so bruise " the spiritual anatomy " of two people that they can no longer live together in peace and contentment ? If we could find that out , we might help boys and girls , who are now at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they hope , in the green pastures of contentment and domestic happiness . For the desire to achieve a happy marriage is such a fundamental of the human heart that I am convinced that if we could find some way to assure it , the world would promptly become a better place to live in . But in that clearing house of human misery that is Reno , I learned that there is no royal road to this bourne , no simple , easy , or even recognizable hurdle that we may jump into the promised land . For each case is different , and while a study of them can show some of the pitfalls , even a compiling of all the reasons given in all the divorce courts of the world would not present a definite and infallible formula for Mary Smith , smiling behind her wedding veil , or for John Brown , stepping forward so happily to meet her . Yet there are some ' weaknesses in human nature so universal , some failings on the part of men or of women so general , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who have- them their folly and their danger .  | Probably one of the most common of the causes of unhappiness as they affect women is illustrated by the case of a beautiful , high-bred woman whom I saw one day in the courtroom . I had wondered what could have occurred sufficiently wounding to impel her to go through the obvious agony that she was suffering in that room . She was one of the few who seemed to hesitate over the essential misrepresentations about residence intention , to choke over the necessary falsehood . She told her story in a voice so low that even the Judge had to strain forward to hear it . She said that her husband had a possessive attitude toward her that allowed her no individuality of opinion or of choice . He expected that she would subordinate any ideas she had to his , would live no life except his , would discard any interests that he did not share , especially those that would prevent her always being there if he happened to want her ; he demanded that she see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom he did not care ? a modern version , with the voluntary feature left out , of forsaking all others and cleaving only to her husband . This meant leaving her alone without friends or resources while he was indulging in his own hobbies or pastimes of bridge of an evening , golf of a Sunday , and fishing trips of a summer . She had borne this for ten years , had sat at home alone day after day , night after night , but ? and here her voice almost died out altogether ? she felt that she could not go on with it any longer and keep her sanity . I HAVE no doubt that this attitude ? a hangover from the days when man and wife were supposed to be one , and that one the man ? is the cause not only of much dissatisfaction and unrest on the part of intelligent women , but also of the very idleness of women of which many men complain , and which undoubtedly brings many evils in its train . Whenever I heard it told in court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , consisting of a pleasant , sufficiently able man and a talented wife . For ten years after they were married she gave up her friends , who , being primarily interested in art , bored her husband , gave up the sculpture in which she had begun a successful career , even sat meekly by while he forbade her accepting an order that not only would have enhanced her reputation but would have added to the none-too-healthy family fortune . But after ten years there came to her the feeling that she was wasting her life , devoting herself to a husband who seemed to have lost all interest in her and to a child who would shortly be beyond the need of her care . Suddenly the future loomed up before her drab , desolate , intolerable , and she made a declaration of independence . She was perfectly frank and honest about it . She told her husband that she was going back to her sculpture , going to see her old friends and any new ones that interested her , going to recognize only one restriction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscience . He was stunned , furious . But she was determined , and the result points a moral . Some one has said that a man marries a woman because she is different from any woman he has ever known , yet , as soon as they are married , he tries to make her over on the pattern of his mother and sisters . That is what this man had done , and , once he seemed to have succeeded , he lost all interest in his creation . Then she made her declaration of independence , and promptly he found her all of the things she had seemed to him in the beginning ? interesting , companionable , lovable . Now he is so proud of her that he is a bore to his friends . That man 's wife has not landed in the divorce courts . As I sat there myself day after day , hearing the stories of her meek sisters who had struggled to please , I could not but wonder how many of them might have been saved by a similar declaration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know they had lost , by giving them what they did not realize they wanted . Men , at any rate during the days that I was in court , were much less frequent complainants in divorce actions than women . There are those who will say that they have less cause for complaint ; but there are ways of accounting for it other than that . Men frequently permit their wives to get the divorce , or even urge them to do so when it is they who want it ; also , men can bear marital unhappiness more easily than women , not only because their " love is of their lives a thing apart , " not the essential core of happiness it is to women , but also because they have so much more freedom of action outside their homes and marriages . One of the judges told me that the majority of men seek a divorce only in the event that they want to remarry . Certainly a large number of those I met were planning to do so . But this , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had without the personal contact my stay in Reno gave me . Before that , I had vaguely considered that a divorce for the purpose of remarriage was an indication of lightmindness , even of depravity ; there , I saw that it was more frequently evidence only of a pitiful eagerness for a new chance at happiness . Most of the men I heard testify charged mental cruelty . A large number of them complained of the absence of cooperation or encouragement on the part of their wives ; and a number of cases I saw showed how lack of sympathy , tolerance , and encouragement could warp and cramp everything a man tried to do until his whole nature , his characteristics , his achievements , were altered by it . ONE man whom I got to know rather well while he was waiting for his divorce decree gave a perfect example of this . He was a magnificent-looking person with a fine physique and a handsome head , but with a naive , littleboy quality about him that contrasted strangely with his appearance and with the fierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to his applying for a divorce : " I admired her greatly . She seemed to have all the qualities I lacked and should like to have had . And I was willing that she should be the stronger , that people should say that she was superior to me . I was proud of her . But she got to he what a child I know calls proud of herself . She felt superior to me , and was continually rubbing it in . Now , had she let me feel this good and hard every few months or every year or so , had she been tolerant and understanding , had respect for the honesty of my intention , and appreciation of what I was trying to do even if I did n't succeed , if she had encouraged me , I might have got somewhere ? I do n't know . But this constant belittling of my efforts at success and happiness , this constant succession of wounds to my spirit , finally broke me , and I did n't care what happened . Then , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ever since then I have felt that I could breathe again , could get somewhere , make something of my life . " Many men complained that the idleness of their wives had led to their marital trouble . Yet within the same session other men , or even those very same men , would express resentment that their wives wanted to go on with a job or a career after marriage . Leaving the courtroom one day after this point of view had been brought out in one form oranother several times , I asked ex-Judge Bartlett what conclusion he had-reached about it . In reply , he quoted a passage from his book , " Men , Women , and Conflict , " in which a young lawyer who had had much divorce experience had said : " I certainly do think a wife ought to work . Especially if there are no children . A job keeps a woman out of mischief , improves her health , and gives her an interest in the home that many otherwise do not have . Most of all , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes  | more ruction than we realize in a lot of homes . The man comes home tired after his day at the office , and his wife is full of pep . What 's the result ? She thinks he 's getting to be an old crab , and he thinks she is losing her mind . " " Of course , there are things to be said on the other side , " the Judge added , " but when one sees some of the idle , useless women who come to court , it is difficult to remember them . " I smiled . That very day I had watched two pretty , giggling ex-typists of about twenty get their divorces , one after the other , on the grounds of mental cruelty . The one said that her husband had a violent temper , which seemed easily understandable when one looked at her ; the other complained that her husband nagged her about her housekeeping , which also seemed likely . After they got their divorces , they went prancing down the courthouse steps arm in arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Judge knew and I knew and every one else who saw them knew that in a year or so they would be back in court seeking another change , that they would continue to do so as long as they could find men to marry them , and that would be as long as human nature is human nature . WHICH brings us to the whole matter of entering marriage too lightly , one of the important reasons for our crowded divorce courts , and to the question of choice . For , among the men who marry girls of this type , as surely as among the girls who marry the male wasters who are their counterparts , are many who really want the sort of homes and children that mates of this kind will never be able to give them . Dr. Frank Crane used to say that there were only two great questions in the world ? why he married her , and why she married him . The answer , of course , is sex attraction without any analysis or investigation or question . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , they endow each ether with all the qualities and virtues that seem desirable to them . Brainlessness becomes childlike innocence and arouses the protective instinct of the male , while a Don Juan tendency on the man 's part rouses the vanity of the woman he has chosen above all others . If only young people could be made to view objectively the partner they are about to take for life , to give honest thought and consideration to the opinions of others who are disinterested ! I do not mean that they should take the statement or judgment of those who weigh a man or woman in the scales of their own pet social , financial , or other prejudices , but that they would do well to pause before the balanced judgment of those whom they respect , those who are in a position to observe objectively , and hear the real opinions of others . Then young people should talk things out together thoroughly before marriage : what they mean to put into it , what they expect to get out of it , what their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should not expect that they will come with marriage . The old idea oft marrying a person to reform him went out , . with " The Face on the Bar-room Floor " and other martyr exaltations . Engaged couples should especially talk out the question of children and of money , those frequent sources of misunderstanding in marriage . I told before of the man who had sought a divorce because his wife had refused to have children . That same session , another man , a young merchant , told how his wife 's extravagance had cost him first his business , then his job ; told how when he remonstrated with her , she had gone to an expensive sanitarium , claiming that his cruelty had made a nervous wreck of her . From there she had sued him for divorce on the ground of-mental cruelty , telling him privately but frankly that had she not believed that he had sufficient money to permit her all the luxuries she craved , she would never  | have married him . This so hurt his vanity that he contested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won . Had either of these men had a frank , honest talk in advance with the woman he planned to marry , it would have brought out the fundamental differences in their views and ideals , and would have reduced the divorce figures of that particular courthouse that day from eighty-five to eighty-three . Compatibility , another important element in marital happiness , is a more difficult thing to be sure about through the haze of romance . It can so easily be confused with a biologic urge for each other 's presence . A community of interests , similar backgrounds , tastes , and ambitions are all desirable , if not essential to complete compatibility . In a sufficiently long courtship or engagement , their presence can be ascertained . That they are important is shown , I believe , by the statistics I gathered for the article on marriages made in coeducational colleges which appeared in Goon HousEKEEPING in April , 1931 . They proved that less than one-eighth as many of these marriages end in the divorce court as of those contracted under circumstances less favorable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another essential for a completely happy marriage that I hesitate to mention because to so many people the mention of it is considered in bad taste , any reference to it an overemphasis of its importance . Yet , if this is to be an honest statement of what I learned , I have no choice . For while never once was sexual maladjustment given as a cause in court , practically all of those qualified to know ? lawyers who had the confidence of their clients , judges who by their broad understanding succeeded in penetrating beneath the legal causes , physicians , and psychiatrists ? told me that it was responsible for ninety percent of the unhappy marriages : that is , while it may not be the apparent cause for the unhappiness , the other causes would not arise if there were satisfactory sexual adjustment . Where this is what it should be , people are blind to , or willing to put up with , faults that would seem intolerable otherwise . If this is true , and there is great weight of evidence to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer in conscience shy away from it , leaving young people to sink or swim , as we have done in the past . For education in this , as in most of the other phases of married life , will , in the eyes of those who have given the subject unbiased thought , help tremendously in many cases ; they believe that the time has come to educate people to know what the sex relationship can mean in beauty and fulfillment , as a " mutual expression of comradeship and affection " which has " its source in the thought and purpose of God , first for the creation of human life , but also as a manifestation of divine concern for the happiness of those ' who have so wholly merged their lives . " They feel that the time has come to put the emphasis on the beauty of sex properly used i rather than on its ugliness when unwisely used , to teach what it may mean when it is a part of 1 the spiritual and mental oneness of two people rather than how degrading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educate people in a technique of sex which involves consideration and thought for each other , and which should make for a sexual adjustment that would bring the complete physical satisfaction , contentment , and relief from tension , and , seeking that , do so much to bring marriage nearer to the heart 's desire . Just as the question of sex brings the answer of education for marriage , so , , too , do all the other phases of marriage come back to education . Formerly , in the good old days we like to idealize , preparation for home-making was so @#  | much a part of a girl 's subconscious background and training that there was no need for her to devote time to it outside . Now , between school and the job that is sought immediately after , a girl does not have the opportunity to see what goes on in her home even if she is so fortunate as to have a real home , not a mere address for delicatessen delivery boys ; even if she is so lucky as to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cluttered up a bit by younger brothers and sisters . Again and again I heard men testify to the failure of wives to use to advantage the money they earned , to keep their homes or their children in order , to make them comfortable . One man , a high-class mechanic , said that his wife had no idea of order nor of cooking . She had made a half-hearted effort in the beginning to keep their house clean , but she had never attempted to do any cooking until after the baby came , claiming that it was just as cheap to eat in restaurants . When the baby 's coming meant going out separately for their meals , or leaving him alone , she made some little effort to get an occasional meal at home with the aid of a canopener . But she soon gave up the attempt and , taking the baby , went back to her parents . Her husband understood that she had her old job back , and she was not asking anything from him except sufficient money to care for the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman , brought up by a Puritan mother to abhor divorce , but now , through his experience as a lawyer and on the bench , most liberal in his views , talked to me about this one day . He said that there were only two types of complainants to whom he was unsympathetic , the women who wanted to live in luxury without giving anything in return , and the men who , having taken the best of a woman 's life , wanted to leave her when she was no longer young and able to earn a living . He put the blame for this right up to parents who did not teach their children the responsibilities of life , did not teach their girls to give value for the things they received , did not teach their boys to play the game . Dr. David Snedden of Columbia believes with many other educators in teaching not only the practical domestic arts in our high schools , but in teaching to children and society in general the losses from divorce , and the " values which can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My experience in the divorce courts made me feel that , in addition to all this , boys and girls should be taught what the factors are that do stabilize marriage . They should learn what the elements are that build up a home , which are the ones that break it up . They should learn that some elements such as friends , time , interests , can be either cohesive or disruptive , and that the wise handling of them by one or both of the mates will determine which they are to be . I said something like that at a dinner the night before I left Reno . It is interesting to know , parenthetically , that here in this town where a man and his wife could quarrel at . breakfast ? and many people do quarrel at breakfast ! ? and be divorced before lunch , all but one of the half-dozen or so prominent citizens at that party , including an ex-judge and the city attorney , were with the wives they had met in college and had been married to ever since . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more specific conclusions from their years of close daily contact with those seeking freedom . They felt that young people should be told to try to avoid the atmosphere of discord , the discussion of things on which they could not agree , until finally those elements would have disappeared - altogether ; above all , they felt that each partner should be persuaded to go into marriage with a willingness to put in 75 percent of the effort , rejoicing @#  | in a 50 percent return , and with the resolution to respect the other 's individuality ; they should be made to see that , only in so far as each partner is allowed to be an individual first and a husband or wife second , will he be able to contribute his own individual share to the success of the home . They should be taught enough human psychology to know that the more they identify themselves voluntarily with their mate 's problems and situations , the more will their own chances of similar cooperation increase , and with it their own happiness ; they should be taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect for honesty of intention and effort , as well as to use common sense and a sense of humor , to pay each other little loverlike attentions occasionally , especially when there is weariness or discouragement or some other special need for it . These experienced observers felt that much of the trouble was because the young people of this irresponsible age were unwilling to undergo the discipline that even the most congenial of marriages involves during the adjustment period . They felt that no two people brought up for twenty years or more in different environments , with different backgrounds and training , possibly with different ideas and ideals , could come together and go on in one harmonious path without a little adjustment here , a bit of sacrifice there , and a great deal of love and understanding and sympathy everywhere . And it is just this that these men and women felt the present generation was too impatient to give ; they enter marriage , not with the idea of making a go of it at all costs and at all personal sacrifice , but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can easily break it off and try again . So they are unwilling to make the effort to develop the qualities of strength and character that make of marriage a fine , enduring thing . They felt that if these young people could be taught to put as much conscious effort into making a go of marriage as they do into making a go of their business or of their social life , the millenium might not be here , but some of the divorce-court judges would have to join the ranks of the unemployed . pERSOALLY , although I left this city of marriage disintegration with a sense of hopelessness about marriage , I am no longer discouraged . A return to the places where the large majority of people remain married to the same mates until death doth them part convinces me that much of my despair . about marriage was induced by seeing and hearing too much of divorce ; convinces me that the cynicism of many people about marriage is due to the overemphasis on divorce stories and statis tics in the news , an emphasis not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage has no news Value ; there are no reporters standing outside happy homes to get stories about them for their papers ; no paper has found it worth while to call attention to the fact that even though there is one divorce out of every six marriages in any year , each year there are five marriages for every divorce added to the . steadily increasing accumulation of permanent unions . In 1930 , for instance , with 1,128 , t$o marriages and 191,63o divorces and 4,333 annulments reported , the number of permanent homes back of the divorce statistics was increased by 932,217 . Even though , with all this allowance , the present figures seem discouraging , we must remember that we are going through a transition period in which men and women , too , are adjusting themselves to woman 's new economic and social position in the world , to a new philosophy of individual freedom and importance , to a world in which there are tremendous economic ups and downs , and in which the marrying generation is suffering from all the irresponsibility , lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wake of the most devastating war the world has ever known . I agree with Dr. J. P. Lichtenberger , Secretary of the American Academy of Political and Social Science , who says in a recent book :  | " It does not seem reasonable to us to assume that a mode of life which is based upon the most fundamental qualities of human nature , which has evolved as the result of cumulative human experience , which has lasted through all the vicissitudes of changing civilizations from the beginning until now , is likely to be abandoned because of the onslaught of hostile criticism of its present defects . . . " We venture to assert our belief both in the perpetuity and in the improvement of marriage in the future . "
