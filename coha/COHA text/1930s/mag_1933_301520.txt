Eighty of the 130 U. S. Episcopal bishops convened last week in Davenport , Iowa for a meeting of the House of Bishops . Large on their docket lay the matter of appointing a new assessor ( assistant ) to the Presiding Bishop of the church , to succeed Bishop Hugh Latimer Burleson of South Dakota who died last August . Presiding Bishop James De Wolf Perry had chosen his man and the House of Bishops approved : Bishop Philip ( " Phil " ) Cook of Delaware . A tall , grey-haired , hearty , eloquent churchman , Bishop Cook has been a missionary on the Dakota plains , a vicar in Manhattan , a breezy rector in San Antonio , Tex . and Baltimore . Missouri-born ( July 4 , 1875 ) , he now lives at " Bishopstead " in Wilmington . His specialty has been home missions . When he went to the War he told his friends : " I do n't know what I 'm going to do along the lines , but you may be sure I 'll do my damnedest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cook 's duties will be far from strenuous , involving such functions as consecrations , dinners , graduations , cornerstone-layings which the Presiding Bishop is too busy to attend . There was speculation last week as to Bishop Cook 's chances of eventually becoming Presiding Bishop . But the Episcopal Church does not provide for recall of bishops , and Bishop Perry , 62 , is a healthy tennis-player and onetime high-jumper . <P> In Davenport last week the House of Bishops acknowledged but did nothing about a petition of 2,115 clergymen against admitting non-Episcopal ministers to Episcopal communion , occasioned by a service in which the administering of communion was shared by Episcopalians , Baptists and Methodists in St. Louis Episcopal Cathedral last year . The House also urged the U. S. to join the World Court ; came out for aggressive pacifism ; sympathized with persecuted Jews in Germany .
