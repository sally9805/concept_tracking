Episcopal Bishop William Lawrence of Massachusetts was convinced that war was " wickedness , useless and stupid . " Against such teachings , Dr. William Thomas Manning wrote to the New York Times that " Our moral sense as a nation is dulled . . . . Our present lack of national spirit is due also in part to a vast amount of well-meant but mistaken and misleading and really unchristian teaching about peace . " Soon Dr. Manning , Bishop Lawrence , Episcopal Layman George Wharton Pepper , Dr. Harry Emerson Fosdick and others signed a trumpeting manifesto : " Sad is our lot if we have forgotten how to die for a holy cause . " <P> That was in 1916 and 1917 , before the U. S. entered World War I. Since then , some of the warlike preachers have died ; some-notably Dr. Fosdick-have sworn off for life . Dr. Manning , now Bishop of New York , has kept his guns oiled , said recently : " A Christian can not be neutral between right and wrong . . . . Right is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimate duty as a nation may be if the conflict is prolonged , no one can now say . . . . " <P> Believing that a look at the past is worth two at the present , the pacifist Christian Century ( nonsectarian weekly ) last week began printing a condensation of the best available study of parsons ' wartime behavior - Preachers Present Arms , by Sociologist Ray Hamilton Abrams ( Round Table Press ) . When he wrote his book six years ago , Sociologist Abrams was skeptical of clerical calm-downs between wars , pointed out that western civilization possesses " perhaps the greatest war book known to man " - the Bible . <P> Not yet in World War II has appeared a prototype of the most picturesque character in Preachers Present Arms : the late Dr. Newell Dwight Hillis , Brooklyn , N. Y. Congregationalist , father of Marjorie ( Live Alone and Like It ) Hillis . Because of U. S. " dillydallying " over entering World War I , Dr. Hillis proposed that the tortoise be substituted for the eagle as national symbol . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories , some of which the Christian Century printed . One of the Doctor 's favorites : " When the syphilitic German has used a French or Belgian girl , he cuts off her breasts as a warning to the next German soldier . "
