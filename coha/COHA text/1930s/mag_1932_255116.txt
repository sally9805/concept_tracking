As strange as the sight of a member of the Union League club demonstrating a tap-dance were these lines in the august New York Times fortnight ago : " Five planes brought dozens of machine gats from Chicago Friday to combat The Town 's Capone . . . . Local banditti have made one hotel a virtual arsenal and several hotspots are ditto because Master Coll is giving them the headache . One of the better Robin Hoods has a private phone in his cell ! . . . Haw ! " <P> The words , of course , were not the Times 's own ; they were quoted from the gossip-colyum of Walter Winchell in the tabloid Daily Mirror . Directly and indirectly they made Walter Winchell news last week : directly because his colyum was on the street only six hours before Gangster Vincent Coll was machine-gunned to death in a telephone booth , and Colyumist Winchell ( who had been frightened into getting a police bodyguard ) was summoned before the Grand Jury to explain his advance information ; indirectly because they precipitated a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Kobler of the Mirror . <P> A full year ago it became an open secret that only a contract held Winchell to the Mirror . He fought continually with Publisher Kobler and he fought with Managing Editor Emile Henry Gauvreau-with whom he used to fight when they occupied similar positions on Bernarr Macfadden 's vulgar Graphic . Publisher Kobler objected to Winchell 's appearance in vaudeville . He objected to Winchell 's radio broadcasts ( currently for Lucky Strike ) , charging that he gave out news to which the paper was first entitled . He removed the colyumist 's smart , pert secretary Ruth Cambridge from the payroll ( Winchell has since paid her salary ) and required him to pay for his own stationery , telephone and telegraph tolls . <P> <P> Matters became warmer last month when the Mirror asked Winchell to write for its new Sunday edition . Winchell demanded an extra day 's pay ( $166 ) on the basis of his $1,000 weekly salary . Refusing , the Mirror engaged a Sunday substitute . <P> The Vincent Coll incident caused a new ruckus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privy to the councils of murderers , barred colyumist &; secretary from any part of the Mirror building save their own small office . <P> Every move by the Mirror is carefully considered lest it give Winchell the supreme satisfaction of breaking his contract . The instant that should occur Winchell would skip three blocks downtown to Joseph Medill Patterson 's big little Daily News ( completing his ascension of the scale of Manhattan tabloids ) . According to Newsdom , weekly of unemployed newspapermen , the News offered Winchell $1,000 a week for a Sunday colyum alone .
