Harold LeClair Ickes , Secretary of the Interior and master of PWA , has established himself beyond compare as the champion name-caller of the New Deal . Last week he crossed tongues with ham-fisted Chairman Dies of the House 's famed UnAmerican Committee , calling Mr. Dies " the outstanding zany* of our political history . " Mr. Dies retorted that the Secretary of the Interior " literally reeks with the venom of hatred . " <P> But it was in connection with Eugene Talmadge , Georgia 's wild-eyed , wild-haired onetime Governor , that a brand-new addition to U. S. invective issued from Mr. Ickes ' press conference . " The eneciable Mr. Talmadge , " Mr. Ickes was reported to have called him . There is a word of Greek derivation , " enecia , " meaning " constant fever . " Georgia 's Talmadge retorted : " Mr. Ickes ' throwing away money will give any taxpayer a constant fever . " <P> Not for nothing is Mr. Ickes called " Honest Harold . " When he saw himself given credit for an accidentally erudite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . His listeners had misunderstood him , he said . What he had called Mr. Talmadge was not " eneciable " but " ineffable . " <P> *Webster : A subordinate fool , clown . . . who apes ludicrously the tricks of his principal . . . .
