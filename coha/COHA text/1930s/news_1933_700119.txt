txt TRAFFIC IN DISORDER . Rough ' Sequences in Movies Should Be Shortened , It Is Held . To the Editor of The New York Times : I suppose it never occurs to some of the movie-makers that many people get deadly tired of the frequency and monotony of night-club dancing , barroom fights and the wicked wiles of bad men from Bitter Creek . TheY certainly do not realize that there is any reasonable limit to human endurance when their husky hero gets into a mix-up with the deep-dyed villain , exchanging blows the seeming force of which should give an opponent his everlasting quietus . Yet these remarkable contestants knock each other clear across a room , heels over head , smashing furniture as they fall , only to rise immediately and with furious onslaught resume the fray . Such scenes are long drawn out , and when the end comes the participants do not usually appear to have been materially damaged , though most of the audience have suffered considerably . Scenes of exquisite beauty appear from time to time , but most of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shooting , barroom and dance-hall exhibits are unduly prolonged . The screen has wonderful educational opportunities , coupled with unqualified advantages for good , wholesome entertainment , and it is a pity that its traffic in disorder should dominate in so large a percentage of its production . W. W. HALLOCK . New York , Sept. 28 , 1933.
