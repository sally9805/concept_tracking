On the fringe of medical research are a number of doctors who sometimes make strange , wonderful and unexplained cures . One such is Dr. Burr Ferguson of Birmingham . Ala. , who claims to cure practically every known disease by injections of diluted hydrochloric acid . In some cases he succeeds . He thinks his treatment works because the hydrochloric acid stimulates the production of white blood cells which destroy germs and help to heal wounds . Medical scholars pay no attention to him or his medication . On the other hand , many country doctors believe in Dr. Ferguson and use diluted hydrochloric acid ( now widely sold in sterile ampules ) and sometimes , somehow , cure their patients . <P> Last week a more scholarly doctor pulled just as startling a medication as hydrochloric acid out of his sick-rooms , popped it before the medical profession for all comers to examine and criticize . Dr. Denis Eugene St. Jacques , professor of history of medicine in the University of Montreal , claims to cure patients of boils , erysipelas , gonococcic infections , rheumatism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflammation of gallbladder , shingles-by injecting finely powdered charcoal into their veins . <P> A surgeon , Dr. St. Jacques , 66 , picked up his ideas eight years ago . He had read in the Cornell Veterinarian how farm animals were treated by intravenous injections . Soon Dr. St. Jacques was dosing human beings , and getting a few other bold doctors ( mostly in France ) to do likewise . Last week he presented the claims for his treatment in an article in International Clinics , titled " Anthraco-therapy . " <P> He asserts that he has clinical evidence establishing that pulverized charcoal mixed with water and injected into a vein of an arm : <P> 1 ) Stimulates production of germ-killing white blood cells without affecting red blood cells in any way . <P> 2 ) Absorbs or neutralizes toxins . Evidence : after an injection , pain immediately diminishes , inflammation and congestion subside . <P> 3 ) Stimulates the linings of bloodvessels , lymph channels and certain organs to produce substances which defend a person against the disease from which he happens to suffer . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particles are less angular and smoother than those of vegetable ( wood ) charcoal . " The carbon particles he declares " disappear rapidly from the blood stream after their injection and are found lodged in the various organs : first and above all in the lungs , but also in the spleen and liver and , to a less extent , in the bone marrow and kidneys where the endothelial cells seem to absorb them . The carbon particles do not cause any local reaction . ... In short , it may be stated with assurance that this new anti-infectious agent-the intravenous injection of charcoal-is an absolutely harmless procedure which produces no local or general reactions , such as fever , chills , or headache .
