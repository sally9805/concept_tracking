From the south portico of the White House , down Constitution Avenue and up Capitol Hill to the great grey home of Congress is a journey of 2.2 miles . One afternoon last week Franklin Roosevelt again journeyed to the Hill to address Congress in person . Ahead lay the imminent battle in Congress over U. S. Neutrality in which the President was about to fire the opening gun . <P> When war broke loose Franklin Roosevelt in the White House had tocsined the U. S. public to a feverish pitch . Then he permitted a week of domestic calm . Last week , before Congress met , he got on the bell-rope again . He upped the Coast Guard 's personnel by 2,000 , for coastal peace patrol . Undenied was a story that his State , War &; Navy Departments had whacked up a precautionary war budget of $20,000,000,000 for a single year , $2,000,000,000 of it for further increases in the military forces , when &; if necessary . The Gallup index to his personal popularity leaped from 56.6% in August to 61%-only 1.5% short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oval office where maps graphed the death of Poland , he received six Republicans , nine Democrats , but no confirmed isolationists , to confer on national unity for Peace . <P> Just behind and to his left was Cordell Hull . In semicircle before him sat Vice President Garner , fresh from Texas ; Speaker Bankhead of the House ; " Dear Alben " Barkley and the President 's actual captain in the Senate , Jimmy Byrnes ; Republican Floor Leaders McNary ( Senate ) and Joe Martin ( House ) ; G. O. P. 's Alf Landon , and his 1936 running mate , flattered Frank Knox of Chicago . To them Franklin Roosevelt forecast a long and widening war , hammered home that the longer the war , the greater the danger to the U. S. , hence the U. S. should try to shorten the war . <P> What he wanted was immediate , non-partisan action by Congress in special session to repeal the embargo on U. S. arms shipments to belligerents . The conferees agreed on non-partisan action for peace ( but not , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics in 1940 and handing Franklin Roosevelt a third term ) . But they gave no committal whatsoever on the embargo . Franklin Roosevelt 's biggest net gain was Jack Garner 's potent support-at least for 30 days ( see p. 13 ) . <P> " Return to Law . " Next day , and the day of Franklin Roosevelt 's trip to the Capitol , was his mother 's 85th birthday . " I do n't think my son has the slightest wish for a third term , " said she at Hyde Park . Her son in Washington was guarded almost as though the U. S. were at war . Ringing him , barricading the approaches to the House chamber where he was to speak , were 150 Washington police , extra Secret Service details , 150 Capitol guards . They policed even the press galleries , stopped Attorney General Frank Murphy when he brushed past . Conspicuously absent from the attending Senators was Idaho 's Isolationist Borah . Absent from the crowded diplomatic gallery were the representatives of Germany , Italy , Japan . Conspicuously present on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Vandenberg , who never turned his eyes from Franklin Roosevelt .
