The few correspondents thus far permitted to interview General Jose Miaja , valiant " Defender of Madrid , " have mostly been given whispered warnings by his secretary : " Please do not mention his family ! Only twice in my life have I seen the General weep-he is most courageous-but please not to mention his family . Hostages , you know ! They have been held since the beginning of the war in Morocco , and the General knows that at any moment they may be shot . " <P> It was a good omen in Spain last week that this distressing state of Miaja affairs ended without another such butchery as had already wiped out , in both White and Red territory , some 120,000 innocent non-combatants in Spain 's savage , stalemated civil war ( TIME , July 27 et seq . ) . A quiet little deal was arranged by General Miaja through intermediaries with Generalissimo Francisco Franco . Of the quid pro quo only half was disclosed . What Franco got was not revealed , though he was rumored to have bought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got was his great big bouncing family : Mother Miaja , Daughters Pepita , Concha , Luisa and Teresa , and Son Emilio . <P> These Miajas were landed not in Spain but in France and put up at the Hotel Beauvau in Marseille . They seemed to have no intention of proceeding to Red Spain , a perfectly simple thing to do last week . The Spanish Red Government promptly appointed Son Miaja a Consul to be stationed at Alexandria in Egypt and the news Agence Espagne rang up the Defender of Madrid . " I am entrusted with the defense of Madrid and I must stay at the front ! " , General Miaja told Agence Espagne . " I blame Fascist propaganda for the reports that I will soon arrive in France ! " " <P> Capitalism is Dead ! " In Spain 's deadlocked war the Miaja Family were last week 's prime news copy , but Italian forces were becoming most active in the White drive to secure Malaga and Il Duce loomed large in Spanish eyes . At Rome that sympathetic female correspondent to whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anne O'Hare McCormick , had a long session on Spain with Mussolini . Crisply he said that Europe 's first task must be to end Spain 's war , that no other European problem of consequence can be solved until that has been accomplished , that Spain is potentially much more apt to give rise to a general European war this year than was Ethiopia last year . " You make me impatient when you talk about Democracy , " Il Duce told Mrs. McCormick . " You talk as if it existed or could exist in this 20th Century world of machines and mass production , as if we were still living in the 19th Century world of individual enterprise ! I tell you Democracy is only a mask for Capitalism , which clings desperately to the outmoded forms that allowed it free play . " The era of Capitalism is over ! Here in Italy it is finished , it is dead. * If by democracy you mean government for and in the interests of the people then our system and ours alone is truly democratic . <P> Bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized that we were the first to face and adapt government to the facts of modern life . . . .
