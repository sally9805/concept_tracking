In the heart of Kentucky 's bluegrass lands , 30 mi. west of Paris and 10 mi. north of Versailles , is Spring Station . Fifteen people live there . It is 600 mi. to the nearest track of the Southern Pacific R. R. The Louisville &; Nashville railroad runs through Spring Station but no trains stop except on flag . Last week a train did stop and out of a private car stepped 15 directors and employes of the Southern Pacific Co . They marched into a one-room brick building . There in a space 25 by 25 ft. the two-billion-dollar railroad system held its annual stockholders ' meeting . There were no stockholders present , except the directors . With proxies representing some 2,000,000 shares , the directors voted on routine matters , elected three directors , including Senior Partner George Emlen Roosevelt of Roosevelt &; Son . After a quick adjournment they climbed in their private car and went away . Nobody in Woodford County knew they had come or gone except two State agents . <P> When they return next year it may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Kentucky , used to hold its meetings at Anchorage ( pop. : 564 ) . But it found that the tax rate was getting too high and moved on . <P> Spring Station is perhaps the strangest of stockholders ' stamping grounds but some other corporations also select out-of-the-way places for their annual meetings . Mathieson Alkali meets at Saltville . Va . ( pop. : 2,964 ) , F. W. Woolworth Co. at Watertown , N. Y. , near Utica where it was founded , Anaconda Copper at Anaconda , Mont . U. S. Steel meets at Hoboken , N. J. , where it serves a light lunch . Not all big U. S. corporations seek inaccessible spots . Of the 29 with the largest number of U. S. stockholders , eight meet in New York , five in Wilmington , two each in Baltimore , Philadelphia . Dover . <P> Others pick small places sometimes out of sentimental attachment , sometimes to avoid high taxes , as does the Southern Pacific . Sometimes , too , they pick them to avoid being annoyed by stockholders . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the most meetings . But Delaware 's liberal incorporation laws allow companies to hold their meetings outside the State if they choose .
