S. to show young Catholic girls entering religious life . In the new chapel of Villa Lucia in Morristown , N. J. , cameras clicked , floodlights glared when 21 Italianate young women renounced the world , took the simple vows of poverty , chastity and obedience , received the habit of the Maestre Pie Filippini ( Religious Teachers of Philip ) in the U. S. Motherhouse of that old Italian order . <P> While at least one priest joined in the picture-taking , the 21 postulants , brides-to-be of Christ , entered the chapel wearing white gowns , white-blossomed veils and carrying candles . In the sanctuary one by one they knelt , begging Bishop Thomas J. Walsh of Newark to admit them to the religious community . From each dark head full-fledged nuns removed the white veil . The Bishop substituted the shiny black sunbonnet-like headdress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl walked back from the sanctuary in the black habit which she expects to wear for the rest of her life teaching in the order 's 14 schools .
