An ancient maxim , attributed to Accursius ( 1182-1260 ) and much quoted by legalists , reads : Cuius est solum eius est usque ad coelum ( He who owns the soil owns above it to the sky ) . Until recently this principle of property ownership was generally accepted , and air rights above property still sell for vast sums. * But the advent of air transport has vastly complicated Accursius ' ancient tenet . When aircraft pass over a man 's land or over foreign territory , is it trespass ? <P> In England in 1920 Parliament decided : " No action shall lie in respect of trespass or in respect of nuisance by reason of flight of aircraft over any property . " The U. S. Bureau of Air Commerce has made transport flight illegal below 1,000 ft. above congested areas , 500 ft. elsewhere , except when landing . As yet , however , no final Federal decision has clarified the mass of contradictory lower court opinions on property rights v. air rights . <P> The question first arose in the U. S. in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Mr. Guille 's farm in New York State . Crowds rushed in , spoiled Guille 's flowers and the court ordered Swan to pay damages . In 1930 , Frederick &; Raymond Swetland tried to enjoin Curtiss Airports Corp . of Cleveland from infringing on their property rights , claiming that low-flying Curtiss planes disturbed them , by their noise and by dropping leaflets . The court ordered the airmen to cease dropping things . In 1934 , on the other hand , Clovis Thrasher sued the city of Atlanta , Ga. , charging that it permitted planes to fly too low , endangering him . and annoying him by the dust they stirred up . He lost the case . And in the same year a similar suit was dismissed in Pennsylvania with the ruling : " Invasions of the air space are trespass only when they interfere with proper enjoyment of reasonable use of the surface . " Last week another court decision on a similar plea added no conclusion to the situation but gave it a fresh slant . <P> Mr. &; Mrs. F. R. Hinman each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planes flew sometimes as low as five feet above the 72 Hinman acres next to Union Air Terminal , Burbank , Calif . The Hinmans declared that they had sole rights to the " stratum of air superadjacent to and overlying " their land and " extending to such an altitude as the plaintiff may reasonably expect to occupy . " Denied by lower courts , the suit was appealed to California 's Supreme Court which last week held that there had been no effective precedent and that aircraft should be treated leniently as " a new and romantic industry . " Concluded the Court : " The air , like the sea , is by its nature incapable of private ownership , except insofar as one may actually use it . "
