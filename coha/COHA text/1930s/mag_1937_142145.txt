Did Franklin Roosevelt still hold the job he held 20 years ago , he would last week have had a problem on his hands . Instead that problem was on the hands of Charles Edison , son of the late great Thomas , but the change made little difference . Mr. Edison as Assistant Secretary of the Navy took his problem to the White House where he and his predecessor pored over it together . The elements of this problem were : <P> 1 ) The Walsh-Healy Act , which requires all manufacturers who contract to supply the Federal Government with $10,000 or more of goods to certify that such goods are produced under a 40-hour week . <P> 2 ) The fact that the steel industry , operating on a 44-hour week and 82% of capacity , has so far offered bids for only 7,000,000 lb. out of a total of 25,000,000 lb. of steel required by the Navy for warship construction . <P> 3 ) An unpleasant choice between stopping construction of six destroyers and three submarines in Government Navy yards , or of having Madam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walsh-Healy Act ) declare an emergency and permit the steel companies to supply steel manufactured by 44-hour-a-week workers-thus offending Organized Labor . <P> A similar problem , about how to get the Navy 2,600,000 lb. of copper developed last December , was solved by finding a loophole in the law : buying copper which had been refined before the law was passed . Navy Men Roosevelt and Edison were also worried , not only because Britain had launched a $7,500,000,000 naval building program but because it was quite possible that Britain might buy 44-hour steel from the U. S. while the U. S. Navy could get no steel . The President had no solution to offer , and next day he put pressure on the steel industry by announcing at his press conference that something must be done to end the deadlock . Mr. Edison consulted Assistant Secretary of Labor Edward McGrady. got a ray of hope when Mr. McGrady called him back to say that TVA had just succeeded in buying $30,000 worth of 40-hour steel from Carnegie-Illinois Steel Corp. - perhaps the steel industry was weakening . <P> From Knoxville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charge of secret service men . No prisoner was William Andrew but an honored guest , sent for by the President who had read in the newspapers that he was a onetime slave of President Andrew Johnson and his ambition was to meet President Franklin Roosevelt . Hobbling into the White House on an old cane , he hobbled out an hour later with two canes , one of them silver-headed , inscribed " Franklin D. Roosevelt . " Said William Andrew to the press : " They let me in and the President had me sit down . I told him about when President Johnson died . I slept with him six days and six nights in Tennessee after he had a stroke . I was only 18 or 19 when he died , but in them days , you know , boys were just like men . . . . President Roosevelt is my kind of white folks . You do n't get nervous with a man like that . He 's just like Andrew Johnson . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
