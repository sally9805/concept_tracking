The year was 1898 ; the month , December ; the place , Paris . A woman with blue eyes and blonde hair , and a dark , bearded man worked in taut silence in a place described as a ' ' cross between a horse stable and a potato cellar . ' ' The walls were of rough planks ; the glass roof , patched in places , leaked when it rained . There were three battered deal tables covered with apparatus , a few chairs , a pot-bellied stove . On the asphalt floor lay coarse mats . <P> Suddenly the woman turned off the gas lights . The darkness was complete except for the faint luminescence of something in a tube which she held in her hand . Few days later Marie Sklodowska Curie and her husband Pierre announced they had discovered a radioactive element which they called radium . <P> The President of France , the entire French Cabinet , the president of the University of Paris and scientists of three continents gathered in a lecture hall at the Sorbonne . The year was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbed in his dreams , had been killed by a truck . Marie Curie had been appointed to the chair of physics which he had held , first woman to hold a Sorbonne professorship . This was the occasion of her first lecture . She appeared in a plain black working dress . She bowed politely , waited for the applause to stop , turned to her class sitting in a group . " Pierre Curie has prepared the following lesson for you , " she said , and from a notebook began to read the lecture her husband had not delivered . <P> Last week a frail and broken woman lay in a remote sanatorium in the French Alps under the shadow of Mt . Blanc . A racking cough had settled in her chest . Pernicious anemia was in her blood . Perhaps long exposure to the deadly element she and her husband had discovered was taking its toll . But Marie Curie 's mind was clear and she was ready to die . She had come far since her birth in Poland 66 years ago . In Warsaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal of a girls ' school . Their daughter Marie had to flee to France because Russian officials frowned on her efforts to stimulate interest in the Polish language . While studying in Paris she lived in a bare garret , ate meals that cost half a franc a day , met a brooding , handsome young physics instructor whom she twitted for expressing astonishment at her learning , and then married . Becquerel 's accidental discovery of radioactivity of uranium compounds in 1896 excited them greatly . They obtained a ton of pitchblende from the Austrian Government , began a long series of crushings , pulverizations , leachings , precipitations , crystallizations with apparatus at which a modern physicist would sneer . Much of the time Mme Curie spent stirring a cauldron with an iron rod as thick as one of her thin arms . At last they had a thimbleful of a white salt . In it they found first polonium , finally radium.
