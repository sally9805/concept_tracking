txt Continuing their sensational advance of recent weeks , prices of corn reached new highs on the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday . High grade cash corn sold at $1.37 a bushel for the first time in sixteen years . The September future was quoted at $1.191/ ? a bushel , a price it has not reached since 1925 . Wheat , oats , and rye sold at new high levels for the season . A factor in the price rise was the weekly crop and weather report of the department of agriculture . Despite local showers , the survey pointed out that most of the corn and wheat region showed further deterioration from the drouth . Illinois and the region east of the Mississippi in general are not as hard hit as the plains states , but crop prospects for this state continue to decline in the face of heat that has ranged as high as 108 degrees . More heat is forecast for Illinois , Iowa , Kansas , Nebraska , and Missouri , with temporary relief from showers expected in parts of Illinois .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
