The Girl from Wyoming ( by J. van Ostend van Antwerp ; produced by John &; Jerrold Krimsky ) is the creaking American Music Hall 's annual horselaugh , garnished with beer &; pretzels . The tale of " a Harvard graduate trapped by sex in the purple sage , " The Girl from Wyoming provides an uncannily false picture of the West in the days of Diamond Dick saloons , half-breed beauties with roses between their teeth , and the Pony Express . <P> The essential thing about the production is the beer : after the fourth or fifth schooner the audience roundly cheers the Harvard man for refusing to touch liquor , just as roundly cheers the Girl from Wyoming ( June Walker ) for having been weaned on it , loudly hisses a villain who looks like a referee at a snake race .
