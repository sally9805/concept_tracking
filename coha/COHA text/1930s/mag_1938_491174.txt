N N EX-CONVICT who has just finished , as I have , a twelve-year stretch for murder , gen- aridly seizes on any mitigating circumstances he can find to soften the facts in his record , especially if he has done time in Alcatraz as a desperate and incorrigible criminal . Personally , 1 have no apology or alibi to advance . I killed an Army sergeant to protect my own life . I served ten years and four months in Atlanta Federal prison , which was bad enough , and twenty months in Alcatraz , which was worse . Though I have no excuses , my family has ; they say it was Grandfather Conway 's wild blood which cropped out in me . A Tennessean , he fought in the War Between the States in what the Southern country man always called a " critter company " ? the cavalry of Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest . When General Lee surrendered , Grandfather Conway did not ; he bestrode his horse and rode to Mexico , where , shortly afterward , to the scandal of a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a professional gambler . Wild blood , my family said , when trying to rationalize their own black sheep , made me run away and join the Army in the chase after Villa , in 1915 , as a member of Troop D , 5th Tennessee Cavalry . I was then seventeen , having been born in 1899 and named , ironically enough , after the peace-loving William Jennings Bryan . I went to France with Battery F , 114th Field Artillery  --  the same outfit that furnished eight men who tried to kidnap the Kaiser , in Holland , after the Armistice  --  and saw service on three fronts . After the war I enlisted in the Regular Army , Sixth Infantry , Camp McClellan , Anniston , Alabama , and there I killed an Army sergeant in self-defense . I was turned over to the civil authorities , freed for lack of evidence , and ran away to Florida , then Texas , and finally to Villa Aeuna , Mexico , where I became a professional gambler . Crossing back into Texas in 1925 , I was arrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , tried and convicted . I drew a sentence of eighteen years , entering Atlanta Federal prison November 13,1925 , as Convict No. 21019 ; 1 left prison at Alcatraz exactly twelve years later as No. 293 , having won six years ' time off for good behavior . The Plutocrat at Atlanta B Y COMPARISON with Alcatraz , life was soft and easy in Atlanta . The routine was not so deadly , and the men had a chance to make a few dollars in the mills which they could use in the commissary to buy candy and cigarettes . If they had money they could get other privileges too . Al Capone , for instance , lived like a king in Atlanta , and it was currently reported among us that he had money brought in to him from Chicago by the suit-easeful . I never saw any of this money directly , but I did see several bills of $100 denomination which convicts told me Capone had given them for favors . It made a tremendous impression on me , because they were the first century notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , of my own personal knowledge , that AI Capone had a bodyguard in Atlanta . This bodyguard was composed of convicts , and it was right comical to see Capone exercising in the yard surrounded by his guard . Of course they were n't armed with machine guns , as his Chicago bodyguard was , but every man had a long knife or a blackjack . Such weapons were plentiful in Atlanta at that time . The Road to the Rock C APONE was unpopular in Atlanta , as he was later in Alcatraz , but he was n't unpopular because of the types of crimes he was supposed to have committed ; he was unpopular because he was a weakling and could n't take it . Right here is a good place to correct an idea which is held by some sentimental people who like to think that kidnapers , for instance , are looked down on by other prisoners . This simply is n't true , because some of the most popular prisoners at Alcatraz are kidnapers  --  Alvin Karpis , Doe Barker and Machine Gun Kelly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that the murderers were the aristocrats of crime  --  men who killed in the hot blood of passion . Speaking by and large , there is no grading of prisoners by any social caste system set up by themselves , with one notable exception  --  that is , the sex criminals . In any American prison the men committed for sex crimes are pushed off to themselves and are not accepted in the company of the so-called decent element of criminals . But the reason , 1 am bound to say , is not that they have committed revolting crimes but that they are unstable , unreliable and often actually insane . Although / was eligible for parole at the time , I was sent finally to Alcatraz , from all I can learn , because I would not testify as the Government wanted me to testify in a murder case within the walls of Atlanta prison when a convict named Homer Flanagan stabbed a convict named Russell Smith to death . The Government could n't find a victim in this ease , and , partly because I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been , because he struck in self-defense , with a knife which a Negro convict had given him . After the trial I was put back in solitary confinement , where I had been held as a material witness . I did not dream that my silence would send me to Alcatraz . One afternoon as I dozed on my cot , a guard opened the cell door and said , " Get up and get dressed ; we are making a trip . " " Where to ? " I asked . He did not reply . When I had dressed I was handcuffed to another prisoner named Ralph Sullivan , who had also testified for Flanagan , and we were taken to the railroad station . I do n't suppose I would have known where we were going for days had not one of the guards relaxed after we had made ourselves as comfortable as possible in chains in the drawing room of a Pullman car , " I forgot to tell you boys , " he said casually , " that we are going to Alcatraz. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sugar , please , " and the first time I said it I recognized the man known as Machine Gun Kelly , who passed the sugar promptly . Seated at the same table with me were Al Capone , Albert Bates and others well known to the front page . And though talking is prohibited , they do manage to talk in a grumbling monotone out of the corners of their mouths . After breakfast I was assigned to work in the laundry , and my prison numbers were sewed on my clothes . I have read , since leaving Alcatraz , that the moving-picture company which made a film based on life at Alcatraz found out everything about the prison except how the convicts are numbered . They found out several things about the equipment of Alcatraz which are n't true . There were already thirty military prisoners at Alcatraz when it was converted into a civil prison , in 1934 , and they just started the numbers off at one and continued upward , making these military prisoners the first thirty . I was the two hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piece of duck cloth which was three inches wide and eight inches long . Two pieces of cloth with numbers are sewed on the prisoner 's coveralls , one in front , right over the heart , and the other in hack , between the shoulder blades . These numbers are large enough to be seen at a distance of twenty yards and , of course , the idea is to make a visible target in a vital spot for the guards if the prisoner attempts to escape . I received a cordial welcome from the men when I reported for duty at the laundry , where 120 men work and where all newcomers are assigned , as the grapevine had vouched for me as a man who , for a friend , lost a practically certain parole and had risked six years of good time . The first men I met were Charles ( Limpy ) Cleaver , a mail robber , and Gene Colson , also a mail robber . Al Capone was Friendly , having remembered me from Atlanta prison . He tried to talk with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends had warned me against him . I think Capone gets lonesome because his job is sweeping the yard outside and he does n't come in contact ? with many of the other men . He has lost all the fat privileges he used to buy in Atlanta , although they did let him buy the instruments for the band , which consists of guitars , violins and mandolins . . R Barbershop Battle I thought . the best way to handle Capone was to let him know immediately that I was n't in his crowd . So when he tried to give me magazines , I told him I did n't want them . When he did n't take this hint , I said : " Dummy up , Al , dummy up . " This is prison slang meaning " Be quiet , do not speak to me . " Capone looked at inc for a second and then replied as he turned away : " O.K. , pal . " Capone has lost about fifty pounds since coming to Alcatraz , weighing now about 200 . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I do n't think that is true . The other convicts think that is just some propaganda he started in the hope of getting transferred tosome other stir where his money will be good again . It is true , however , that there have been several brawls in which Capone figured . There was one in the early summer of 1936 . Since newspapers are contraband at Alcatraz , I do n't know what was printed ; but here is the prison version of one of them : A convict named James Lucas , who weighs about 140 pounds , was getting his monthly haircut while Capone was sweeping up the hallway of the basement outside the barbershop . When Capone passed by the barber 's chair , he grabbed a banjo , hit Lucas over the head with it and ran . Lucas grabbed the scissors from the barber 's hand and cornered Capone in the clothing room , where be stabbed him in the region of the kidney . Capone struggled to get the scissors and got his hand cut when Lucas jerked the scissors away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and separated the men . They took Capone to a hospital , where a doctor was called from town to examine him  --  an unusual privilege . Capone 's wound was not serious , but Lucas was placed in isolation and lost all his copper from his thirty-year sentence  --  he will pay with at least twelve more years ' imprisonment . One day shortly after this fight we were speculating in the laundry on what Capone would do when his sentence is served , which will be next year , though lie may have to serve eleven months and twenty-nine days in jail on another charge afterwards . One of the convicts said he knew for a fact that Capone planned to gather up his millions and go to Italy . The dinner signal rings at 11:30 A.M. I found the noon meal as good as the breakfast . Generally they have one meat , such as beef stew or pot roast , and beans , coffee , bread and celery . Supperis at 6:30 and consists generally of chili , tomatoes and apples , with hot tea . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as compared with only one cup of coffee daily at most other Federal prisons . After supper we were marched back to the cell block to stand in front of our cells while being counted again , standing for several seconds until the whistle blew again . That first day I got my first experience with the electric device , commonly called a " snitch box , " which was designed to detect any metal on the person of prisoners as they pass through the entrances . There are two of these devices now between the cell house and the workshops  --  another having been built only a few months ago . The only time I saw men laughing at Alcatraz was over these snitch boxes . The " electric eye " is supposed to be infallible , and I suppose it is. when properly adjusted , but quite often this device was guilty of giving false alarms . For example , I 've seen the 120 men from the laundry marched through these snitch boxes and the alarm would sound as many as twenty or twenty-five times , Each time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and search him , sometimes making him strip in cold weather , and in each instance the guards could not find any metal . And yet , the very next day , two convicts with knives in their pockets got by the snitch box without an alarm . And all of the coos at Alcatraz remember the time when one of the men stuck a too ! in his pocket in one of the shops , forgot to take it out before leaving and passed through the snitch box without an alarm . One day the snitch box sounded an alarm on every man who came from the laundry . The guards ' jerking each man out of line and searching him and finding nothing , appealed to the Alcatraz sense of humor . There was manifestly something wrong with the machine , although the guards thought for a few minutes that a mutiny was brewing . It took hours to locate the trouble , which was merely that the machine was screwed up so tight it was detecting the metal eyelets in the men 's shoes . A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convict who was found to have a pin sticking in his shirt , and a few minutes later it was silent when a man passed who had a knife , which he showed me as soon as we got into the cell house , concealed inside his shirt . So they just keep the thing screwed up loosely and hope it will work , but the guards do n't entirely trust it , because they stop every twelfth man and search him , whether the alarm has sounded or not . After we were locked in our cells  --  and the electric locking devices and snitch mirrors of the Alcatraz movies exist only in Hollywood  --  the lights went off at nine o'clock , though I would n't Like to swear to the exact time , because there are no clocks at Alcatraz for prisoners . There is plenty of time for reading before lights out. , if the men desire . Some magazines are admitted , some are not . All the McFadden magazines and all magazines specializing in crime fact and fiction are barred . Most other periodicals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though any magazine may be censored before it reaches a convict . There was much grumbling in November , 1935 , when // with a good deal of its contents scissored out . The grapevine told us , a few days later , that the officials had cut out an article about Alcatraz itself . One of the convicts complained bitterly because , when he noted in the KEEPING . POSTED section of the POST that the magazine would have a story the following week about his favorite fiction character , Cohn alenerinnon , the Scotch engineer , and when he happened incautiously to remark on this coming treat , the POST was delivered to him with the Glenca.nnon story cut out . This man thought that this censorship was pure meanness . Tho con said he was going to read that yarn yet . He has a wait ahead of him . He wo n't be out until 1950 . Shackled Pens The convicts would prefer to read daily newspapers and detective magazines , which are never admitted under any circumstances , They do n't read many hooks at Alcatraz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of college graduates . I could n't see much difference between the college graduates and the others , except that the college men read more books . I do not recall that there is one inmate at Alcatraz who can not read and write , unless some of the mountain moon-shiners , serving short terms on liquor charges . We were permitted to write only one letter each week . That letter had to be to a blood relative and of not more than two pages . In the incoming mall we never saw the original letters , not even letters from our families . These letters were either rewritten entirely or typed off in bulletin form at the prison office ; a convict gets only what the prison wishes him to get . No inmate of Alcatraz could write to his sweetheart , because she would not be a blood relation , and the men were not permitted to write even to a brother-in-law or a sister-in-law . I had to destroy all the letters in my cell when I left the prison , even some letters from the Veterans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being official mail  --  about my Army affairs . I asked for the originals of my family letters when I left the prison . but they were refused . The most prized possessions in Alcatraz are newspaper clippings , which are passed from hand to hand until they are worn out . Most . of these clippings concern prison breaks , brushes with the law and crimes . A Two  --  Edged Weapon The movies about Alcatraz represent . tear-gas bombs hanging everywhere , like grapes in a vineyard . The prison does have tear gas , but I can not imagine how they can use it without blinding the guards as well as the prisoners . They could n't turn it on when a convict made a murderous attack on the warden in the dining room , because there were thirty guards in the dining room at the time . The tear bombs are arranged in the hack of the dining room instead of in the ceiling , as the movies conceived it . My folks were almost 3000 miles away and I did n't have a visitor daring my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulated . No visitor is permitted to shake hands with a prisoner or to touch him . Between prisoner and visitor is a screen and glass , and conversation is carried on through a tube , one guard standing behind the visitor and another guard behind the convict . Both visitor and convict have to shout to make themselves heard . Naturally , nothing is unheard by the guards , Why do men dread Alcatraz ? Because the discipline is as severe as it is possible to be . Men going to Alcatraz are prepared , of course , for the loss of privileges , but the undeviating routine is what kills and maddens prisoners . Literally you leave all hope behind , for clemency is all but unknown ; only a few short-timers get out , except at rare intervals , and these short-timers are given conditional releases which seal their lips . Men slowly go insane under the exquisite torture of routine . And not so slowly at that , because out of a total population of 317 prisoners fourteen went violently insane during my last year on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call " stir crazy , " going about their familiar routine like punch-drunk boxers . Of course , they do not formally declare them insane , but they isolate them . 1 was familiar with two cases of sudden insanity , when men cracked under the strain . One was a convict whom we called Rabbit , a quiet chap , harming no one and saying little , One night after supper when we were being returned to our cells , Rabbit walked into his cell at the signal and got all his bed clothing and everything in his cell , including his family pictures and trinkets , and threw them all over tho veiling to the concrete floor , forty feet below . // He was a raving maniac when the guards overpowered him and we never saw him again . The other instance is almost too horrible to relate . The prisoner 's number , as I recall it , was 284 . This convict was working on the dock detail when he suddenly went insane . He picked up an ax , laid his hand on the block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close up to the hand . Then lie laid his right hand on the block and begged the guard to cut it off , laughing like a demon all the while . This man was still in the hospital when I left , and lie had not been declared insane , although he undoubtedly was . Next to routine , one of the worst forms of mental torture at Alcatraz is the target practice of the guards . I thought , and every prisoner at Alcatraz today thinks , that this is calculated mental cruelty , because this target practice is carried on right beside the cell house . Target practice is a frequent , almost nightly occurrence , after the men are locked in their . cells . Men can not sleep while these bombardments are going on , and we used to lie awake and try to identify the kind of firearms by the sounds . The guards always shot at dummies made in likeness of the human form , and these were left sprawled along the walkway with bullet holes in vital spots , as silent object lessons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for freedom . One morning we got a laugh when we opened up the laundry and found that wild shooting by the guards had damaged the mangle . This target practice is , of course , to foster the belief that escape from Alcatraz is impossible . So far as I am concerned , I am quite ready to admit that escape from Alcatraz is impossible , despite the apparent escape , in December , 1937 , of a couple of friends of mine named Roe and Cole . It was almost . a miracle that these men got outside the barbed wire , and it will be a first-rate miracle if they escaped being drowned , which I doubt .. There is a drop of fifty or seventy-five feet . into the ocean from the edge of the island , and the boundaries , moreover , are protected by high barbed-wire fences . The guards are mighty quick on the trigger too . Where Nature Stands Guard During my stay there was an old convict , named Dutch , who was working near the incinerator with two guards near . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was , in all truth , the deadline , but we figured be had been trying to reach a piece of leasto paper which had blown over , and he was trying to get back . The guards riddled him with bullets . Every eon at Alcatraz thought this man was mentally unbalanced if he really was trying to escape , because nobody but a crazy man would try to escape across a wire fence and down a seventy-five-foot cliff into the sea with two guards in sight . We heard that the guards were exonerated . As for the waters around Alcatraz being infested with man-eating sharks , I think this is just another bit of fear propaganda , but the waters around Alcatraz have something more terrifying  --  they have a rip tide in which no man could possibly live more than a few minutes . You have heard that Alcatraz is a dumping ground for wild , desperate men , old offenders , professional and confirmed criminals with warped and twisted minds . Yet I knew dozens of men there who were first offenders and had good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October , 1936 , when the authorities at Atlanta feared a mutiny , they confined eighteen men , shipping them all to Alcatraz on mere suspicion . I knew , personally , men whose only brush with the law was the single offense which sent them to Alcatraz . In the summer of 1936 a shipment of fourteen men  --  prisoners who are transported are spoken of as " shipments " ? came from Leavenworth . Four of these were sent up on liquor charges , some of them simple-minded mountaineers who had distilled corn whisky without the formality of paying the internal-revenue tax . Three of these bootleggers were first offenders and several were short-termers . Another shipment brought in a man frornOklahoma , whose offense involved only three gallons of liquor , but who , unfortunately , later was suspected of continuing to manufacture whisky at a Federal prison camp in Idaho . There has been only one man pardoned from Alcatraz , so far as any convict . knows . The lucky man was Shorty Shannon , which is an alias , and he had been charged with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man confessed the crime they had fastened on him . But Alcatraz 's hard-boiled record of no pardons was unmarred , because they sent Shannon back to another prison to spring him . Sentimentalists like to believe that prisons harbor many innocent men . This may he true , occasionally , but Alcatraz had only one prisoner who is innocent by the evidence of the law itself . The underworld name of this man is Hardrock Roy , and his number is 262 . Hardrock was a parole violator from the Texas penitentiary , but he feared for his life in the Texas penitentiary because of something he had done or said . He did n't want to go back when he was picked up , so , to escape being sent back to Texas , he pleaded guilty to it bank robbery which the 0-men were trying to pin on him . The truth is that Hardrock was in jail in Texas at the time of the bank robbery , and the jail has his fingerprints to prove it . The G-men admit to Hardrock that they know he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty , but they continue to hold him in Alcatraz on a twenty-year rap . Men can not be held in cheek always , and trouble began to brew at Alcatraz in February , 1936 , and has continued intermittently to the present day . That mutiny was quickly quelled  --  there is one guard to each three prisoners  --  but the convicts were encouraged because they imagined discipline was lightened . Well known among the leaders of the mutiny were Machine Gun Kelly , Bates , Bearden and several others . The last mutiny began in September , just forty-five days before I left Alcatraz when my term expired on November fourth last , and the next mutiny is planned for this spring . Plans for the next mutiny were well under way when I was discharged , because I was in the confidence of the mutineers , although they would not permit me to join in the last outbreak . This is a species of " honor among thieves " which may be incredible to those on the outside , but in recruiting for the mutiny the leaders urged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join in . The mutiny last fall was preceded by a demand by the convicts for the same privileges accorded in other Fed-oral prisons , thus : 1 . Nominal wages for industrial work , to give convicts a little spending money . ( The duck mill pays three dollars per week in Atlanta , nothing at Alcatraz. ) 2 . Increased time off for good behavior . ( The duck mill at Atlanta gives four days ' time off for each month 's work , but only two days per month at Alcatraz. ) 3 . Daily newspapers , uncensored magazines and radios . 4 . A prison commissary which was to sell tobacco of a grade equal to that sold in other prisons . The convicts want the advertised brands of cigarettes , as the Government issue of tobacco is not liked . The leaders spent weeks picking their men for the outbreak : . It is difficult to organize a prison mutiny , even among the men of the high average intelligence of those at Alcatraz . You ca n't trust everybody , and sometimes even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alcatraz either brings out all the strength of a man or it breaks him into a sniveling snitch and a coward . But almost half the prison population finally joined in the mutiny . A Prison Sit  --  Down Strike It began when the work call was sounded on September fifteenth . Fifteen men sat in their cells and refused to come out to work . They were hustled off to solitary confinement . On the following day all the remaining men answered the call to work , but ten men refused to work after they had reached the mat shop , sitting idle at their machines . They followed the fifteen of the day previous to solitary confinement . Then two prisoners who were cleaning the cell house refused to work and were confined , but not before one of the men had attacked a guard . The strike became general on September sixteenth , when thirty men struck in the laundry . By Sunday 139 men were in the mutiny and had been locked up on a diet of bread and water . The solitary-confinement cells overflowed and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food from the dining room in our jackets to some of the overflow . The rule in Federal prisons is that men in solitary must be fed one solid meal every three days , but this meal at Alcatraz , during the strike , was never very solid . The men in the underground cells groaned and shrieked . At intervals the officials went down to talk to them , asking them to return to work , but they were howled down . Then the officials cut off the water in the underground cells , and the lack of sanitation may be imagined . The place was a perfect bedlam , since the howling , shrieking and cursing never abated , from morning to night . Nineteen days is said to be the limit of human endurance in solitary confinement , and they say , in stir , that anyone who stays in solitary longer than this time-tried limit is tempting death ; but dozens of them stuck it out , and five were still confined when I left in November . The officials were desperately anxious to end the mutiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the laundry and , as this was contract work , the prison was certain to lose a lot of business . And they could not know when a bloody revolt might break out . Warden Johnston was standing in the dining room , talking to us on Friday while we ate lunch . As the prisoners started marching out of the mess hall , Whitey Phillips , a kidnaper , darted over to the warden and slugged him . He knocked the warden down with the first blow , and while the warden was lying unconscious on the floor Phillips kicked him in the face and head with his heavy shoes , breaking his nose and severely injuring him otherwise . I was about . eighteen feet from Phillips when this attack tools place , and I was too shocked to move . If this was the signal for a general uprising , it missed fire . For . in less time than it takes to tell it , the guards were upon Phillips , beating him with blackjacks . They did a thorough job of it , and Phillips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . The prisoners milled about . in confusion and uproar and , at that instant , the outside guard broke out the window glass and stuck his machine gum into the room . The prisoners , screaming , broke out of line and scurried to cover under tables and chairs . " For God 's sake , do n't shoot ! You 'll kill us all ! " screamed one of the inside guards in the dining room . Had the guard outside begun shooting , this story , had I lived to tell it , would have been one of wholesale bloodshed . The convicts were then marched quietly off to their cells , pale and shaken at their narrow escape front death , and the warden and Phillips were taken to the hospital , where Phillips , who by that time was raving , was placed in a strait jacket . Phillips was undoubtedly emotionally insane or , as convicts say , " stir crazy . " He had been sentenced for life for kidnaping . In robbing a bank he had carried off a bank employee as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , which makes kidnaping a Federal statutory offense . What made Phillips brood until he finally broke was his belief that the writs which he had prepared in his cell to present to a court , never got past the warden 's office . He was still in isolation when I left in November , and the prisoners were whispering that the authorities had even refused his father permission to see him . Solitary confinement preyed on the minds of three men on Sunday , and they were released when they agreed to go back to work . Eight more broke down on Monday and were put to work . The leaders exhorted the others to stand firm , but twenty-five men came out on Tuesday and the mutiny received a crushing blow on Wednesday , when sixty men agreed to behave themselves and go back to work . This left forty of the hardiest men in dungeons , and these men howled curses at the guards and screamed reproaches on the convicts who had abandoned the strike . But. , one by one , they began to drop off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stench , Some of them were really sick . Only fifteen men were in solitary by Sunday , and when I left the prison in November , there were yet five stout souls holding out . Knowing something of the horrors of solitary confinement , I do not understand how they stood it , especially in the face of the knowledge that the mutiny was absolutely futile . The plan for the next mutiny at . Alcatraz is diabolically clever . It got its cue from two things which convicts observed  --  the consternation of the officials when it was found the wild shooting of the guards had damaged the mangle in the laundry , and their frantic worriment , when the laundry began to pile up with work it could not do when so many men were on strike . Therefore the men have decided that the vulnerable spot in Alcatraz is the shops , especially those having contract work . If they can tie up the laundry and other shops at Alcatraz , they will paralyze the place . And that is exactly what they plan to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work and remaining in their cells ; this year the mutineers . if they follow plans which they had formed before I left in November , will begin the mutiny by wrecking the machinery in the shops . The officials will , have no warning of this , because the men plan to report . for work as usual and then begin sabotage . They think they can gain concessions by this , and they figure they have nothing to lose . What , for instance , has a man got to look forward to who has three or more life sentences hanging over him ? Most of them felt as I did ; had I known , twelve years ago , what I know now about prisons , I 'd have insisted on the death sentence instead of eighteen years , Asthe time for my releaseap-proached in November , I became increasingly alarmed over the possibility that I had lost my time off for good behavior , although I did n't see how this was possible .

Prisoners , if they have no money , are given ten dollars expense money , plus five dollars per day for each day of travel back to their homes , as well as a railroad ticket . Prisoners are usually released by way of Oakland , but I was taken to San Francisco . Maybe it had some connection with the fact that I was released under the old law and the Government could not close my mouth if I wanted to talk ; I was not released conditionally , as so many Federal prisoners are .
