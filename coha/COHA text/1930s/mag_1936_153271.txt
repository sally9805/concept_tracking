" Bunk ! " exploded Samuel Instill few weeks ago when asked if he would resign the presidency of Affiliated Broadcasting Co. , his first step over the sill of big business since his utilities empire crashed in 1932 . Shortly after the first of the year , Insull friends put up $200,000 for A. B. C. , gave the old utilitarian the presidency , let him pick three members of the five-man board . Profits of the chain ( 21 stations in the Midwest ) stayed out of sight but the bottom of the original pot did not . Few weeks ago after Vice President Quisenberry shot away President Insull 's control of the board , it began to look as if the old man might become a mere figurehead . Last week A. B. C. announced that the 76-year-old tycoon had resigned the presidency , remaining only as a director . In his place , not as president but as general manager , the company put Clarence Leich , part owner of two A. B. C. stations in Evansville , Ind . To a newshawk who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Sir !

Last week young Mr. Deeds resigned as President of United Aircraft Export Corp . to give all his time to United 's Pratt &; Whitney Division . Elected to succeed him was a hefty six-footer named Thomas Foster Hamilton . <P> Born in Seattle , Wash . in 1894 , Tom Hamilton learned to fly at about the age most humans learn to swim . At 14 he had already built and flown gliders of his own , thereby earning his credentials as one of the earliest of " The Early Birds , " a U.

Businessman and barnstormer at 21 , Hamilton went to Vancouver , B. C. in 1915 to teach the Royal Air Force . While there he opened another propeller factory , later moved to Milwaukee to make propellers for U. S. planes . <P> In 1929 Mr. Hamilton sold his propeller business and a second company , manufacturing all-metal planes , to old United Aircraft &; Transport Co . Two years later , Early Bird Hamilton was driving pleasantly around Paris in a Rolls-Royce as United 's European representative . In the export business ever since , Mr. Hamilton spends his U.
