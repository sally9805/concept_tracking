When dark , lanky , impetuous Howard Hughes set a world 's landplane speed record of 352 m.p.h. in a plane built by his own company , it became apparent that he had , besides a genius for movies and money , the finest racer in the U. S. ( TIME , Sept. 23 , 1935 ) . When he set a new transcontinental record of 9 hr. , 26 min. in a standard Northrop " Gamma , " it became equally apparent that he was a top-notch pilot ( TIME , Jan. 27 , 1936 ) . Last week , when he got around to combining these two superlatives , the result was precisely what might have been expected-he made the world 's greatest long-distance speed flight , set a new transcontinental record of 7 hr. , 28 min. , 25 sec . What set secretive Flyer Hughes in motion again was a rumor that someone was about to take a crack at his transcontinental record . Hustling out to Burbank from his home in Los Angeles after midnight , he rolled out his world-record racer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . so powerful that mechanics called the plane " a big engine with a saddle . " At 2:14 a. m. he climbed into the " saddle , " said he might land at Chicago , leaped into the dark . null his big motor thundering , he bored up through the heavy overcast to 20,000 ft. , pulled on an oxygen mask , set off across the U. <P> S. by dead reckoning on the crest of a 60-m.p.h. gale . In the four hours it took him to reach the Mississippi somewhere near St. Louis , three events broke the monotony of his 375-m.p.h. speed-two glimpses of land through the clouds , a brief flurry when his mask went askew . Not until he saw the long furrows of the Alleghenies did Flyer Hughes slant down in a long power dive to Newark . There , no one was aware of his coming until the crescendoing whine of his racing engine jerked heads aloft . Like an angry dragonfly , the little ship buzzed across the field , spiraled up in a chandelle . In the control tower an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let a transport take off , at 1103 p. m. tired Racer Hughes alighted , ran to a telegraph office and sent a wire to Cinemactress Katharine Hepburn , awaiting him in Chicago : " Safe and down in Newark . " Next day he popped up in Chicago with Miss Hepburn . Crowds collected at the Marriage License Bureau , but the pair remained in their hotel . Said her agent : " Miss Hepburn will not marry Mr. Hughes in Chicago today . "
