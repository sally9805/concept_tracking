" Chocked " by Alfred Emanuel Smith fortnight ago in Massachusetts , the Roosevelt bandwagon last week ran into John Nance Garner , onetime cowboy , in California . Again the bandwagon was " chocked . " The New York Governor 's friends were still sure their candidate would be nominated in Chicago next month . But after his California drubbing , they stopped claiming victory on the first ballot . <P> Governor Roosevelt 's California cam paign was managed mostly by leaders of the State 's Democratic organization . His energetic young son James went out to electioneer . On primary eve the Roosevelt forces made prodigious claims about sweeping the State . A Smith campaign had been conducted by good 1928 friends of the Brown Derby - Parson M. Abbott , David F. Supple , Edward W. Cahill - whose strategy was to depend on old loyalties rather than new issues . Meantime the Garner candidacy was backed by three potent Californians - William Gibbs McAdoo , William Randolph Hearst , Will Rogers . The onetime Secretary of the Treasury , heading the slate of Garner delegates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. <P> Garner constantly in the Press . At stake were 44 convention votes pledged to follow the primary 's instructions . <P> Some 600,000 Democrats turned out for the voting , compared with 250,000 in 1928 . <P> Speaker Garner carried the State with a 60,000-vote lead over Governor Roosevelt who ran about 30,000 votes ahead of Mr. <P> Smith . Candidate Garner swept Los Angeles while Candidate Smith ran away with San Francisco . If Governor Roosevelt had had all the Smith votes , he could have trounced Speaker Garner . <P> Busy about his House in Washington , Speaker Garner would say nothing more than " very significant " about his California victory which put him back into the presidential picture . <P> " Why should I say anything ? " said Gov governor Roosevelt at Warm Springs , Ga . <P> " A personal tribute ! I carried San Francisco , " remarked Al Smith in Manhattan . <P> Visiting Howard Coffin at Sea Island Beach , Ga . Campaigner McAdoo McAdoodled : " The first real test of strength has been settled . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidential nomination but it is a serious and perhaps irreparable blow to the Roosevelt candidacy . " <P> The latter , though retarded , was by no means beaten yet . Governor Roosevelt 's opposition remained split on everything save opposing him . The Garner-Smith Favorite Sons forces might hold a one-third veto power over the convention but there was no sign yet of their combining on a candidate who could muster the nominative two-thirds majority of 770 . The idea of Al Smith sitting down to dicker with his old foes , Messrs . McAdoo and Hearst , produced only grins among those who recalled the Battle of Madison Square Garden in 1924 . <P> When the convention roll is called Governor Roosevelt will get the first votes announced from the floor because last week , almost unnoticed during the California excitement , he carried Alabama by default . The State which in 1924 kept stubbornly casting " 24 votes for Underwood , " until the Davis compromise on the 103d ballot , will this year lead off with " 24 votes for Roosevelt .
