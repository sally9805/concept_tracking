THE following incidents are further act ual experiences of mine with various types of hotel cheats . For many years I have been a hotel credit manager on the Pacific Coast . It was just . after a big convention in 1929 that I received a report of a ni0I11 ? actiney for a man registered as J. C. Doe , who had failed to pay his bill before departing- . . A statement 1 111 his account , with vouchers , . was sent to me , and I began an investigation by referring to his original registration . This showed that he had made no room reserval i4iu , and when I asked the clerk who had roomed him how 1w had got a room without a reservation at a time when we had to disappoint so many people , 140 answered that the day Mr. Doe arrived they had received several eaneella Lions , so that when he registered lie was assigned to a room without any hesitation . The clerk described him as being well dressed , a man about fifty years of age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 180 pounds , wit h gray hair , and a scar 4- ) r sore on his right cheek . Ile hail a good-looking suitease and a valise , and had been particular to ask about the price of rooms before registering . He explained t hat he traveled for a firm in New York , and though . he had a drawing account , his expenses were eventually charged against his commissions . The floor clerk 's description of the man was the same as that of the room clerk , only she added that he wore a fraternal pin , a. diamond scarf pin and a large diamond ring . A further check showed than he had left the hotel about 8:30 each morning and returned about 5:30 P.M. , which seemed to hear out his statement of being in the city on business . However , he had had no company and had not used the telephone or telegraphed while in the hotel , norhad he received any mail ; so it began to look as though his departure without paying his account was not an oversight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's having taken his baggage out . I i is account , showed charges for room , two restaurant charges each day , one charge for valet service fer pressing two suits , and a- laundry vharve amounting to 533.40 ; so he must have had some clothes in his Lags when he arrived . I tried in every way to find out how he had left the hotel Nvit , b his baggage , but could not , and could only learn within an hour or so the time he left- . From the approximate time he left , which must have been around 7:30 in the morning , I reasoned that he had either gene to another hotel in town or had taken a day train to a neighboring city . I prepared a bulletin for the different hotel associations and detective agencies , giving an accurate description of him and his baggage . At about the same time I received a bulletin warning hotels to he on the lookout for a man named . J. C. Doane , alias C. Dole , alias J. C. Doke , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of a 81000 bill . He was described as being about seventy years of age ; otherwise the description was identical with that of Mr. J. C. Doe . I I is method of operation was to register at a hotel and hand the cashier of that hotel a genuine $1000 bill and ask for change . The smaller hotels , of course , were not prepared to change a $1000 bill , so he would take it hack , with the request that he be advanced twenty or fifty dollars , or whatever amount lie thought . he could get , and to have the amount . charged to his account . Naturally , the cashier would assume that a man with a $1000 bill was entitled to an advance on his account , especially when the hotel did not have change for it ; so his request invariably would be granted . The mistake was made by the 1144 ( 11 cashier in not holding the bill.as security . About ten days after ' my bulletin had been published I received word that the much-sought-for man with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco while up to his old tricks , and was being held for the Los Angeles authorities . The hotel which had caused his arrest had not been defrauded , as he had just registered ; so an officer from Los Angeles went to San Francisco and returned with the man to face our charges . lie swore that he had never been in our hotel and stated that he would bring suit against the hotel for false imprisonment just . as soon as he was released ; so it was up to me to prove the charges that were preferred . Those who had described him said that he was about fifty years of age , while his true age was seventy-three ; so I began to doubt that we had the right man . I learned from the property clerk at the police station that Mr. Doe had had $1365 on his person when arrested , that he had a fraternal pin , a diamond scarf pin and a diamond ring . The sore apparently was a. cancerous growth on his cheek and . tallied with our description , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only person who could identify him was a floor clerk who had talked to him for several minutes one evening while she was trying to locate his key , which had been mislaid ; and she was on a two weeks ' vacation . // As his preliminary hearing would come up before the floor clerk would return , I realized that something had to be done quickly . I remembered the laundry charge , so I secured his laundry mark and proceeded to the county stockade where he was being held . I asked the desk sergeant if I could see Mr. Doe , and explained that I was the hotel credit manager who had had this man returned here . I said , " You know , he claims that he did not stay at our hotel , and I am here to see if I can prove that he did . It is important that I see him . " The sergeant then sent for the suspect , and when I saw him coming toward me my heart sank . I saw a little old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom anyone would have known to be more than fifty years of age . When he came up I greeted him with " How do you do , Mr. Doe . " He shook hands with me and said , " You have made a mistake . My name is not Doe . Who are you ? " " Oh , " I replied , " I am sorry . I thought you knew . I am : Al r . Grimstad , credit manager for the Blank Hotel . " Before I could continue he interrupted me with " You people have me mixed up with someone else . I have never been inside your hotel , and before I finish with you people it , will cost you money . " I then asked him if he would write his name a. few times on a slip of paper that I handed him , and he willingly obliged . When he finished I asked him to write a few other names , and he showed sonic surprise and hesitation when I called out some of his aliases . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had disguised his handwriting , so I decided to try him on something else . I took a slip of paper out of my pocket on which were written the letters " J. C. D. XX " and held it before his eyes and asked , " Do you recognize that ? " Ile looked closely , and if he knew what it meant he did not show it . He answered , " No ; it means nothing to me . " I said , " No , of course not . Now , if you will just . let me look at the laundry mark on the hand of the shirt that you are wearing , that will be all for today . " I reached over and turned down his shirt band , and sure enough there it was ? " J. C. D. XX . " I then asked , " How did you get that shirt into our laundry if you were never in the hotel ? " He admitted , " Well , you 've got me . How much will it take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squaring , " I answered . " Your ease is being handled by the district attorney 's office , and I understand that they have several other cases against you . Each of these little jumps you have made is likely to cost . you 1.80 days in jail  --  even the little bill of $9.65 against you at a hotel in San Diego . That is our law here . It 's rather inconvenient , is n't it ? " " I was never in San Diego in my life , " lie protested . " No , " I replied , " of course not . Just . like you were never at our hotel . They will have to prove that too . Anyway , you are experienced , so you will , no doubt , he able to act as your own attorney . " That remark either flattered him or angered him , for he opened up with " Yes , I should be able to . This is not my first experience of this kind ; in fact , I have been in jail or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make , as I have lived pretty comfortably at the expense of hotels . They have been easy victims for me . In recent years , however , some change has conic over them . I no sooner skip one hotel than the next hotel knows about it . Maybe it 's me , but I hardly think so . At that , " he added , " it is probably due to my efforts that the best hotels in the United States are paying so much attention to the people who have been imposing on them . If any changes in their policies have been brought on by my unconscious influence , I believe that you should show me some consideration for my part in it . " I smiled , but , did not answer . He then told me that in his younger days he had been a horse trader , and related some of his experiences , which were exciting and amusing . I believe he meant that he had been a horse thief , as the records showed he had been in three penitentiaries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country during the past fifty years . Mr. Doe Gets a Permanent Home A A THEN Mr. Doe 's case was called he was found IV to be a habitual criminal , which , in the state of California , means a life sentence ; so he was given life imprisonment in Folsom . His was a. world 's record , so far as I know . He had defrauded practically all the larger hotels in the United States and Canada , and there were many sighs of relief when . a bulletin announced that he was to he a permanent guest at . Folsom . One evening as I sat at my desk a. man about forty years of age , five feet eight inches in height , and weighing about 14 ? pounds , walked in and greeted ( Continued on Page 33J Identity Proved T REPLIED , " We shall I see . I have a very good description of you from a few of our employes , who are available any time it . is necessary to identify you . " I then took a slip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description , giving his age as seventy instead of fifty . He looked at me questioningly and said I had made that up since seeing him . I added , " I do n't see you wearing a fraternal pin or diamond scarf pin or diamond ring . What did you do with them ? " He answered , " That is easy . You have seen the property clerk . I do n't see how anyone in the hotel can identify me when I have never been there . " ( Continued from Page 21 ) me with , " Good evening , Mr. Grimstad . Are n't you working rather late ? " I replied , " Yes , I am compiling a little data . for a case in court tomorrow . " And while I talked I tried to place him , but he came to my rescue quickly with , " I just saw your name on your desk and figured that you would be able to help me . " He had come close to me and I could smell liquor ou his breath  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be mistaken . He introduced himself as Dr. Richard A. Roe from Virginia , and told me that he had given up ten years of practice of medicine there to establish himself in Los Angeles . He said that when he left Virginia a few weeks before , he had sold his home and furniture for 815,000 and had been on a protracted spree ever since . He stated that he had not eaten anything for a couple of days , as he had been expecting some money , and I hat he only had a nickel in his pocket , besides a cashier 's cheek he had been unable to cash . I asked him to show me the check . and to my surprise he handed me a cashier 's check in the amount of SS000 , which had been made out I wo days previously by a bank in San Francisco and bore the stamped indorsement of one of our local banks . Now , it had always taken us at leash . three days to have checks cleared in San Francisco , and I immediately thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He seemed sincere , though , as he spoke with a slow Southern drawl which was certainly not affected . I asked him to identify himself , and he said that he had nothing with him , but suggested that I come to his room . where he would show me letters and canceled bank vouchers , bills of sale , and even his brass sign , " Doctor Richard A. Roe , " which he had used in his office in Virginia . However , the more he talked and the more I looked at . that check , the more I imagined . I even imagined that . he had knocked the real Doctor Roe in the head and had taken his complete outfit. , so I was none too anxious to accompany him to his room . Doctor Roe Identifies Himself I went . over the same questions with him many times , trying to trip him up , but could not find any discrepancies in his statements . Finally I asked him to go to his room and get the letters and receipts and whatever else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone , I looked in our bankers ' directory for the name of the officer who had signed the check , and sure enough , he was listed as one authorized to sign for the bank . I phoned to the room clerk and found that Doctor Roe had registered a bout ten in the morning two days previously ; and as I was still wondering how that ? heek had got to San Francisco and had been returned so soon , he returned with a suitcase . ' Until now I had said nothing about the stamp on the baek of the check , thinking t hat he would in some way give himself away . So I waited until he had shown me cards , letters , canceled cheeks and the brass sign , which he seemed to think was the best evidence he had . I then asked him about the hank 's stamp on the hack of the check and he explained that he had arrived on the Southern Pacific Railroad , in the morning two days before , and as he had only a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked the taxi driver to take him to a bank . He did not know one from another , so the taxi driver took him to a lank on the way to this hotel . He had to wait a few minutes for the hank to open and asked the taxi driver to wait for him . ' When he presented t he check and thought that he had sufficiently identified himself , he asked that they rush the ? heck for payment , as he was running short of money . Pauper With $8000 I re then came to this hotel and registered , and after paying the taxi charge and tipping the bell boy for rooming him . found that he had about fifty cents left . He was too proud to ask for an advance of money on his account , and he did not understand that he could sign his meal cheeks ; conseiiuently , he lived on N-hat liquor he had brought with him , and coffee and cigarettes , between the time he registered and the evening he came in to see me . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bank for the money on the cheek , hut the check had been returned unpaid . The cashier at the bank explained to him that the check was so large that they would need personal identification , that the bank in San Francisco required it even though the check was genuine . He did riot know anyone in Los Angeles , so the bank returned the cheek to him , and though they drew several lines through their indorsement , nevertheless , it . showed that they had handled it . That was what puzzled me  --  to have a bank put its indorsement on a cheek of that size and then return it. ; so I asked him where he had got the money to purchase it .. He told me that it . was his lifetime savings  --  that it was all he had left after ten years of practicing medicine , and that he had bought the check with cosh three days before in a day-andnight bank in San Francisco , just before getting on the train for Los Angeles . Everything checked up so that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that in as much as the bank required personal identification , we would nut be permitted to cash the eheck immediately . The only way that we could help him would be to send it . in for collection , and then only after he had supplied us with personal identification . Then he suggested that I phone to San Francisco in order to identify him , and told me how he had come into possession of the check . He said that he had been drinking for several days in San Francisco , until the evening t wo days previously , when he had fallen down on a sidewalk just . as a police lieutenant came along . The officer picked him up and asked him all about himself and where he lived . He said he was staying at a downtown hotel , but that . he was en route to Los Angeles . The ollieer asked him if he had a ticket . hi Los Angeles , and he replied , " No , " but assured the ? nicer that he had money with which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and took out 88000 and about eighty-five dollars in bills , and then spent eonsidera ble time explaining where he had got the money . He said the officer had then induced him to go with him to the day-and-night bank , where he purchased the cashier 's check for 88000 , which left just enough money for him to pay his hotel bill and purchase a ticket to Los Angeles , with enough left for meals and incidentals . I asked him the officer 's name , and I immediately put in a call for the Central Police Station in San Francisco . It did not take more than twenty minutes to get the lieutenant on the wire . I told him I wanted him to identify a man who was trying to cash an 88000 cashier 's cheek . He laughed and recalled the incident immediately and told me the circumstances . He related how he had picked up Doctor Roe , and after satisfying himself that the doctor was all right , had suggested that he purchase a cashier 's check . He stated that he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 88000 when he saw him in his condition , and especially in the part of town where he had found him . He quoted something about the Lord providing for fools , cripples and drunks , and suggested that perhaps this was what had saved the doctor . He described him , calling attention to his Southern accent and the fact that the doctor had mentioned several times that this money was his lifetime savings , stated how the doctor had told him all about . his home and office in Virginia , and finally asked to have me put . him on the line . The identification by now was almost complete , but the conversation that followed was amusing and convincing . It was something like this : " Hello , is that you , lieutenant ? .. I feel fine . . . . That bank would n't cash that check . They said I had to have somebody they knew to identify me. and I do n't know a soul but you within 3001 ) miles of here . What shall I do ? . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . That 's good advice , lieutenant , but I do n't need it now , because I 'm never going to take another drink in my whole life . . . . Thank you , I 'll sure do that if I ever get up to San Francisco again . " The Bad.Check Hour He then handed the phone to me , and the lieutenant assured me that there was no mistaking that voice and that I would be perfectly safe in cashing the check . Doctor Roe felt greatly relieved when I told him we would be able to handle the cheek and would send it in for collection , and meanwhile  --  until the check was paid  --  he could have $100 to take care of his immediate wants . Here he had a perfectly good check for 88000 which , a few hours before , he could not have traded for a meal . It was truly a parallel of the paradox : " Water , water everywhere , nor any drop to drink . " Doctor Roe remained at the hotel for a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek , and during that time I am sure he did not take a drink of any kind of liquor . He visited rue several time while here , and we enjoyed several good laughs over his predicament . After he left , I did not see him again or hear from him for about four years , when one day after banking hours I was surprised to have a lady whom I knew quite well hand me Doctor Roe 's personal check for 82500 drawn on a local bank , with a request that I advance her the money . She explained that the doctor had been arrested on a narcotic charge and that his bail was set at 82500 in United States currency . . I did not show any surprise , nor did I cash the check , but followed up his case and learned that , though he had money enough in the bank to cover the check which the lady presented , it took all and more than that to keep him out of the penitentiary . Besides a heavy fine , he received a suspended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the practice of medicine thereafter . The bad-check hour , which is usually between three and four P.M. , is known as the crisis in a credit manager 's day , as this is the time of day when checks are returned by banks for various reasons  --  mostly N. S. F. ? not sufficient funds  --  and for that notation there are a million excuses . It was at one of these times , when I was working at a San Francisco hotel , that I signed for the return of three checks amounting to $700 drawn on a national bank by Herman A. Blank , and indorsed by Donald Dash , which were being returned with the rather unusual notation , " Payment Stopped . " These , in turn , were charged against our account at the bank . Mr. Blank , the maker of the checks , had established his credit at the hotel and had always been in good standing , so I felt no uneasiness as to the ultimate outcome of this transaction . The indorser , however , was the first person to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had received the money from the hotel ; and upon inquiring for him , I learned that . lie had left the hotel on the day he had cashed the checks . The Elusive Donald Dash Donald Dash , the indorser , and his wife had registered from a Middle Western city , but they were not listed in the city 's telephone directory , and after checking every source for information concerning them , without avail , I telephoned Mr. Blank and told him that I was holding his checks , and asked him to stop in my office and redeem them . When he arrived I asked him why he had stopped payment on the checks , and was told that lie had got into a. crap game in Mr. Dash 's room which he learned was crooked only after he had lost all the cash he had with him and had issued the checks . After thinking over the way he had been tricked , he decided to save what he could , and , as a result. , stopped payment on the checks . He explained that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the way he had been taken in , however , it was evident that . the trap had been set for him . Anyway , he realized that he was responsible for the payment of the checks and redeemed them immediately . In doing so , however , he asked that . I try to collect the amount from Mr. Dash , and right . there is when I undertook something that later caused me as much anxiety as I have ever experienced in connection with cheeks , good or bad . I promised Mr. Blank that I would try to locate Mr. Dash and would request him to return the amount of money he had realized on the checks . We started the pursuit by tracing the baggage he had sent from the hotel . This I located in an apartment house which , I realized soon afterward , bore a very questionable reputation . In phoning that apartment house I was told that there was no one there by the name of Donald Dash and that no baggage had been delivered to the place for several days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy job ( Continued on Page 401 40 THE SATURDRY EVENING POST March 5,1932 ( Continued from Page 38 ) when I had promised Mr. Blank that I would try to find Mr. Dash . What would be still more difficult would be to induce Mr. Dash to return the money after l had located him . The returned checks were what are known as second-party checks . The return ef these is a civil rather than a criminal offense , unless , of course , conspiracy could he proved . In this case we knew I he maker of the checks , who had explained the transaction to us ; therefore , to apply fora warrant for the arrest of Mr. Dash was nut of the question , and Mr. Dash probably knew t his as well as I did . So I telephoned to Mr. Cheney , manager of the hotel-protection department of a detective agency , with whom I had worked on many eases , and asked him to meet me the following day ; meanwhile to send an operative to a spot near the apartment house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved from there . About two o'el  --  ek the next . day Al r . Cheney came to my office in the hotel and we proceeded to the address . We were met at the door by a Japanese house boy who was apparently a. lookout , and I had quite a time convincing him that he would be safe in letting us in . Knowing nobody in the house , I took a chance by asking to see two ? ir three different women , call ing names : it random . At last 1 mentioned Mabel . which brought some action . Mabel was ushered out to us , and it was easier to convince her that we had not conic to raid the place than it was to convince the Jap ; so we were asked to come into the parlor , where another girl soon appeared . It did not take long to get the information I wanted . I told Mabel that I was a friend of 1I r . Dash 's and that I had some very important information for hire , including a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a check charge a I t he hot el . She informed me that neither he nor Roxie  --  who , I assumed , was the girl with whom he had been registered  --  was in , and promised to warn him when he returned . I ihaanked her awl , upon leaving . told her that there was another place where he might he located , and if I did not find him then . would return a little later . When we left the house the operative who had been watching the place followed us until we were a safe distance away , where ? ve stopped to give him further instructions . After describing Mr. Dash to the operative , I handed him the checks and told him to go hack and wait for Mr. Dash and , when he located him , to inform him that payment had been stopped on t liem and demand $701 ) , which was the amount he had realized on the transaction . Mr. Dash Joins in the Eunt About eight o'clock that evening a man answering Mr. Dash 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about to ring the door bell the operative stepped up and asked him if he was Mr. Dash . The man answered , " No , I ? ut I know Mr. Dash quite well . He hangs aroulld the ? Hotel , and if you will wait a few minutes I will walk over to the hotel with you . I 'm going over , anyway , and will be glad to try and locate Mr. Dash for you . " In about twenty minutes he reappeared , and they started toward the hotel . He had changed his clothes , put on an overcoat and carried a valise . On the way he showed quite an interest in Mr. Dash , and when they arrived atthe hotel he excused himself while he went to ( - heck his valise . It took him a. long lime to check that valise , so the operative went . to the check room to find out what . was detaining him . There he learned that no one had checked a valise like the one described within the lust hour . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rile know what had happened . Ile described the man to me , and I then told him that he had been out for a walk with Mr. Dash and instructed him to return to the apartment house and wait there or have a relief operative wait there , and to follow Mrs. Dash when she moved her hag-gage , as it was almost certain that Mr. Dash would not return there . The following day the relief operative telephoned me excitedly , saying that baggage was tieing moved from the apartment house which was identical with t hat deserihed as belonging to Mr. and Mrs. Dash . that a lady had come out of the apartment house carrying ; an overnight hag , and before getting-into a cab , had instructed the express man to deliver her baggage to the ferry depot . Threatened With a Damage Suit Again I told him to follow the baggage until he found Mr. Dash , which would , no doubt , be soon after the baggage reached the ferry . He followed instructions , and at the ferry depot saw Mrs. Dash check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oakland , where she boarded an overland train . He was thorough , so he got , on the train also , and at t he Sixteenth Street Station the woman 's companion of the evening before hoarded the Irain and went directly to the woman the detecti. e hard been shadowing . Just as Mr. Dash had kissed the woman and made himself comfortable . the epe  --  ative approached him and demanded KM to reimburse the held for the money it had paid out on the checks he had cashed , and on which payment had been stopped . Now it developed that this opera live was no student . of law , so that when Mr. Dash refused to part with any of the money demanded , the operative called a policeman from the platform at the station , who took Mr. Dash of the train  --  and this without . a warrant ! Mr. Dash was indignant ; he called to his wife to get . off the train and to have their baggage taken off . which was clone just before the train pulled out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to San Francisco under protest . and when they readied the office of the detective agency , the manager there phoned me and explained what had happened . I was so amazed that I merely answered that I would be right over . On the way I imagined I could see : ? 1r . Dash bringing one of the largest suits for damages in history against i he hotel and its representatives , so I quickly reviewed Mr. Dash 's movements in San Francisco . There was one thing certain  --  that from what we had learned ; Wont Mr. Dash , he could not hear illuvli investigation ; in fact , I surmised that among other charges , he would fear the Mann Act most , so I decided to run a bluff on him . ' When I arrived at the offices of the detective agency I had a hurried consultation with themanager , who agreed that my plan was the only solution to our predicament , as Mr. Dash had already announced his intention to bring suit against the hotel and the detective agency as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the time I opened the door into the reception room where Mr. and Mrs. Dashwere said to be waiting , Mr. Dash had gone to the floor above in the same building and retie rued with an attorney from one of the leading law firms in San Francisco . When I stepped in the room I was greeted with , " Mr. Grimsta.d , am I under arrest ? " To which I replied , " Not to my knowledge . You are not handcuffed , are you ? What are you doing here ? " He then explained how the detective agency 's operative had called the policeman who had forced him to leave the train and return to San Francisco . He said that . we had no criminal charge against him that would warrant his arrest and threatened to bring suit against the hotel and its agents immediately . Then lie introduced me to the attorney whom he had engaged to handle his case . When I had acknowledged the introduction , the lawyer remarked , " It looks as though someone made a serious mistake in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially in view of the fact that he is not criminally liable for negotiating the checks issued to him by Mr. Blank . As I understand it , those are second-party checks , and unless you can prove that the maker and indorser conspired to defraud you , Mr. Dash is entitled to some redress for the embarrassment and humiliation caused him . " I then asked the lawyer if he knew anything about the man he was representing , and he stated that he did not . fie added that Mr. Dash had just come into his office a. few minutes before and that he had not had time to question his client . I then informed him about the cheek transaction and how we had traced Mr. Dash 's baggage to the questionable apartment house , and all about his actions thereafter until he boarded the train in Oakland . When I had got I hat far I turned to Er . Dash and said , " You will stand a fine chanee suing us for false arrest or defamation of character , or whatever you have in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you have probably forgotten t hat it is a penitentiary offense to transport a woman into this state who is not your wife ; so I will promise you that if you retain this attorney to prosecute a claim against us , you will need him badly to keep you out of San Quentin . The lady with you will , of course , be held as a material witness . " ? Making Everybody Happy Mr. Dash seemed dazed ; he seemed suddenly to have lost his nerve and voice , and said nothing for about half a minute . Finally he asked to talk to his attorney alone . Just what happened at that conference I do n't know , but apparently Mr. Dash was advised to forget his suit for damages and to get out of California as quickly as possible . I noticed a change in his attitude when he returned , and when he asked again if he was under arrest , I answered , " No . Why do n't you go over to the railway ticket office and change your reservation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight 9'clock train out of here this evening . " He asked , " What about the detectives and the money ? " And I suggested that he find Mr. Blank and try to collect the amount due us from him . He stated that Mr. Blank was staying at another hotel and that he would go right , over to see him , and phone me at our hotel within anhour to let me know what progress he had made . I agreed to this , so he and the woman known as Mrs. Dash started out . A few seconds after they went out one door , another door down the hall opened and an operative shadowed them . At the same time I left to return to the hotel . About an hour after I arrived I received a telephone call informing me that Mr. and Mrs. Dash had gone to the Southern Pacific ticket office at the other hotel , where they changed their reservation to another train . From there they went into the hotel lobby , where they checked their hand bag  --  they made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apartment house . The operative asked what else he should do , and I instructed him to stay with them until they were safely on the train . This he did , and when I received a call from him from Oakland shortly after nine o'clock in the evening , saying that Mr. and Mrs. Dash were on an eastbound train , I breathed a long sigh of relief . rilhat was one of the closest calls I ever had , and all on account of an inexperienced operative becoming overzealous . I shudder to calculate the outcome of that mistake , had Mr. Dash had any character to sustain . It . seems to me , however , that all concerned were somewhat fortunate ; even the maker of the checks , who might have lost . more on the transaction . As for myself , with that . experience I resolved never to try to collect money for anyone on a check which had already been paid . Seeking a Lost Lieutenant One morning when looking over the weekly bills rendered , I was amazed to find an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the name of a lieutenant and his wife , of Annapolis , Maryland . There was no charge for heavy baggage on the account and the items on it seemed to invite investigation . In looking over the baggage reports , however , I found that two trunks had been delivered to their room , and upon further investigation learned that the transfer charges on these had been paid at the depot , where they had been in storage for several days . The account was made up of room and restaurant charges amounting to about 5150 , automobile charges , StiO , and a 890 C. O. D. for a dress from one of the local shops which , in some way , had been accepted and paid for by one of our cashiers without having been 0 . K. 'd . I found that these people had made no reservation and had not received any mail or messages of any kind since their arrival , and that the lieutenant had not been seen in the hotel for four days . After exhausting every known way of finding out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave tip and phoned the lieutenant 's room to ask him to stop in my office when he came downstairs . A woman answered the phone and informed me that the lieutenant had gone to Mare Island and would return the following day , when she would have him stop in to see me . I told her that that would be time enough and then put a watch on the room in order that nothing should be removed . In the event that she should go out , she was to be shadowed  --  this as a precaution in case she did not intend to return . Late the next day , having received no call from the lieutenant , I phoned again , only to be told that he had been delayed and would return later . The following day it was the same story . When , by four P.M. , I had received no .... gazzusa -- katis421 ! mik , // ( Continued from Page 40 ) call from him , I called one of the house officers and proceeded to the room . Before we arrived at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed me that the lieutenant . had been there only a wig part of the time and kept her face and head bandaged . At times she was blond , then had brown hair , and again had worn a White wig ; so that she would have been a mystery had she not left her wig in a. very conspicuous place in the closet on one occasion when she left her room . There was no response the first two or three times that I knocked on the door , so I said in a loud voice , " No one seems to be i n , " and I put my pass key in the door , only to find that it was locked from the inside . Realizing that someone was in the room who did not . intend to open the door , I asked the house officer to use his emergency key . When the door was opened we found a little slip of a girl , with a white wig , and her face bandaged , lyi ng in hed sobbing . When she finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she made no response . I assured her that she need not be afraid and asked why she had not opened the door . Still she would not talk . I then said , " It might be better for you to talk to me than to the pollee , " and going to the telephone , I held the receiver down while I asked to he connected with a certain number . When I placed the telephone back on the table she spoke up and asked me what number I had called , to which I answered , " Police Headquarters . " Realizing that she could carry on her bluff no longer , she asked what we wanted . I replied that we had come to find out about the account , that her husband apparently had been delayed longer than expected and the account was past due . I asked her if she had any money with which to pay it . and she answered " No . " I then told her that it would be necessary for her to fill out a credit card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind would be accepted for her . This she said she could not do , as she had no bank or personal references . Putting Over a Bluff She hesitated when I asked her name . Finally she gave me the name under which they had registered , and she said her husband had left her no money with which to pay the account , as he had expected to return shortly . I asked her how long she had been married , and she told me she had been married only a. few weeks , that her husband was a lieutenant . in the Navy and was located temporarily at Mare Island . I asked her where we could reach him by telephone and made a move as if to get the phone . She begged me not to call him and said that , in the first place , he must not be disturbed while on de ty and , furthermore , that they had quarreled before he had left and she did not want to give him the satisfaction of having her call him . She seemed so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my doubt of her , when I again asked her when and where she had been married . This time she said she had been married a few months . I did not let her know that I noticed any discrepancy in the time of her marriage , but shot another query at her . This time I was bluffing ; it worked . I said , " How is it that your husband got into the Navy without the Navy Department knowing it ? " She asked sharply , " What do you mean ? " " I mean just that , " I answered . " There is no lieutenant with that name in the United Slates Navy , and you might as well tell us what you are doing here . " " All right , if you must know . I just picked this man up the day we registered here . I was broke and he seemed like a nice fellow with money . After we had been here a few days I found out that he , too , was broke and that we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this hotel . He promised me hat if I would stay he would manage some way to get money with which to pay the hotel bill and get , my things out .. He seemed awfully nice and sincere , and I still believe that he will get me out . of this . " " You might as well forget . him , " I replied , " and try to figure a way to get yourself cut . - Who are you , anyway , and where are you from ' ? You don't. seem old enough to he very far away from home . " " My name is Dorothy Soandso . I was born near Boston and I am seventeen years of age . I lost my father and mother and only sister in a shipwreck off the coast of Florida , and they are all buried in a little graveyard in that state . This happened when I was eleven , and since then I have lived with my aunt , until last year , when I ran away from school . " Making a Bid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room and observed that she had two trunks , a suitcase and a valise  --  the same amount of baggage that had been reported to my office on her arrival  --  which indicated that the lieutenant had taken nothing with him and which further aroused my speculation concerning him . She then asked me to get her hand bag from a table across the room , and from a. little honk she produced a newspaper clipping and picture of a shiipwreck which seemed to verify her story . Anyway , it was a good story and it was accepted . Finally I asked her what had happened so that . she had to have her face bandaged . I asked . too , if she had been in an accident and why she was wearing a wig , and assured her that if she would tell us the truth about . herself we would try to help her . She seemed to gain confidence and removed the wig and the bandages from her face , and , to my surprise , there was not a mark on her face . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it appear that she was confined to her room while she was waiting for the lieutenant to return , so that the hotel would show her more leniency when it came time to pay the bill . I informed her that the bill was then more than 5330 , and as she was unable to pay it , she would have to leave the hotel and leave all her baggage as security , that we would wait outside the door while she dressed , and that she would have to make her toilet within fifteen minutes . She wished to know if she could take some of her clothes . " Yes , " I replied , " you may take your toothbrush and nightie . " She pleaded that she did not know what she was going to do , as she did not have a cent , so I gave her a five-dollar bill , saying that that would tide her over for a couple of days and that , if she wanted work , there liras plenty to be had . In fifteen minutes she was ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me know where she would bewhen she got . located . I suggested that if she only paid a few dollars a week , it would not be very long until the bill was paid , and she could then have her belongings . A few days later she telephoned me and said that she had gone to work in a restaurant down town and that she would be able to pay at least ten dollars a week on her account , which she did regularly for six weeks , and then I did not hear from her for a while . I finally phoned her at the number she had given me , and she told me that she had been sick and that she expected to go back to work in a few days , when she would resume her payments . About two weeks later I went on a vacation , and when I returned , my secretary had left a clipping from one of the local newspapers on my desk , which read : Died  --  Dorothy Soandso , age 17 years , 10 months , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sister of Mary tioandso . Remains shipped for interment in Alassachusetts . It startled me , and as I recalled the day we had gone to her room and found her so frightened and distracted , I could not help feeling sorry . I read the notice over two or three times , and then it occurred to me that she had f old me that her father and mother and sister were buried in Florida . Why , then , was she to be buried in Massachusetts ? The notice began to look like a trick . But . why ? We still had all her baggage and had made it just as easy as possible for her to redeem it . She surely must have had some other motive . I telephoned to the number she had left with me before going on my vacation . When a woman answered , I asked for Dorothy Soandso and was told that she had died of pneumonia a few days before and that her remains had been shipped to Massachusetts . The woman who : 1 nswered the phone asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , she said that she was Dorothy 's sister and that Dorothy had told her all about her experience at the hotel . This sister story was something new again , and I listened closely as she told me that she would arrange to pay Dorothy 's bill , as she felt that it . - was her duty , and , anyway , she wanted to get Dorothy 's clothes and a few keepsakes to remember her by . The more she talked , the more familiar her voice became , until I felt certain that I recognized it . I did not let . on that I doubted her and went on with the arrangements for the settlement of the bill . She stated that she did not have the balance due on the account just then , but would arrange to pay twenty-five dollars a week until the account was paid . The first payment was to be made on the following Saturday . Dorothy Requires an Alias I wanted to make sure that I guessed correctly about this girl , so I went to the newspaper office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original notice . This I compared with some of Dorothy 's handwriting which had accompanied her earlier remittances , and found it . identical . The following Saturday while I was at luncheon one of the bell boys brought in a messenger in uniform , who handed me an envelope . After I had signed for it I asked the messenger to wait . I opened the envelope and was surprised and pleased to find twenty-five dollars in currency and a note saying : " Will send the same amount next Saturday . " It was signed " Wanda Soandso . " Iasked the boy where he had got the envelope , and he answered that someone had brought it into the office of the telegraph company . I asked him if he had seen the sender , and he answered that he had not . When I returned to my office I compared the handwriting with her other messages , and though it had been disguised , it was easily seen that the same person had written both . A large window in my office faced the street , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my desk looking across the street , I caught sight . of a little girl wearing the same kind of leather coat . that Dorothy had worn when she left the hotel . As I was looking more closely , trying to place the girl , a messenger entered my office with the same kind of envelope that I had received the previous week . I signed for it and again asked the boy to wait . When I opened the envelope I found twenty-five dollars in bills and a note just as brief as the other , saying : Will send twenty-five dollars more , as promised , next Saturday . WANDA SOANDSO . ? It did not take much deduction to connect the envelope with the girl across the street. , so I asked the boy where he had got the envelope , and he told me that someone had brought it into their office . I replied , " That 's fine . Now , go back across the street and tell that girl in the leather coat she is not fooling anyone hut . herself . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the messenger 's fee . You can tell her that she need not be afraid , just . as long as she pays her account. , for that is all we are interested in . " Closing Up the Recount When the messenger had gone , I watched him cross the street , and after a few seconds ' conversation with him the girl went into the first open door she could find , which happened to be a millinery store right where they had been standing . I watched for her to return for at least twenty minutes , and when she finally came out and reached the sidewalk , she was in a great hurry . She went so fast that she was out of sight in a very few minutes . The next . that I heard from her was when she called to pay the balance on the account . and to get her baggage . She was somewhat embatrassed , so I tried to make her feel as comfortable as possible . I told her that I was glad that she had been able to redeem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave it as security for an account in any other hotel . She thanked me and assured me that she had learned h.er lesson . When she was about to leave I said , " By the way , who were you trying to fool when you put that death notice in the paper ? " She smiled and replied , " It was n't you . It was that man I came to this hotel with . I put that notice in the  |p4|per  hoping that he would see it , as I never want to see . him or hear from him again . I published that . notice in a fit . of insanity , I presume , as there was surely nothing to be gained by it . It was not worth the expense . If he saw it , however , and has any conscience , it will probably cause him some regret now and again . You may not believe it , but this is the worst experience that I have ever had , and he is the last man that I will over love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 11k . Continued from Page 42 ) " Well , " I replied , " it all sounds nice , but time will tell . You will probably feel dirferently about all this by the time you are eighteen years , ten months , and six days of age , " which , according to the newspaper notice , would ho just . a year from the time of her supposed death . Abou t. a year later I saw her motoring in Golden Gate Park with a good-looking young man . She was wearing the unmistakable ! eat her coat. , and . looked as if she had forgotten all abouther worst experience , as well as her VOW . The " lieutenant " who , by the way , had never provided himself with a naval uniform , was arrested in Portland on a. bad-cheek charge a few months after leaving our hotel . He hadbeen masquerading as a colonel , and had received a sentence of from three to ten years in the penitentiary , where he no doubt found plenty of time to reconsider his escapades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two articles by Mr. Grirnstad . ( Continued from Page 25 Everybody st arts with the premise Ilia t something is wrong  --  a lot of things  --  hut no program is like any other program . nor is 1 per cent of the protest . politically articulate . " The second sign is the political sign fostered by the so-called independents in the Congress  --  Norris , Johnson , Brookhart , and the rest . These politicians speak ominously of what they will do unless they get what they want , and as they are extremely vocal they have gained a consideral hearing . Take the Republican section of these threateners against their party . If they have 150 votes in the Republican CODvention in support of their program or their candidate , or candidates , they will have more votes than the most seasoned political observers expect ; and there will be 1154 votes in the Republican National Convention , with the remaining 1000 delegates just as good Americans as they are . " Slogans of the Lame Ducks " Far be it from me to decry the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used it , that they would rather be right than President . That is an excellent and seasoned sentiment. , and has very often cloaked the devices of statesmen seeking to save their faces . Next to Lowell 's ' Truth for ever on the scaffold , wrong for ever on the throne , ' it has furnished more alibis for disappointed and disgruntled politicians than any other line in the language . It will , of course , be the slogan of these politicians when they go into battle with the other politicians at . the Chicago convention next June , just as it is their smug sentiment now in Washington . " Then what will happen ? I long ago burned in I he lire of repentance my regalia as a political prophet , but taking one more chance at prediction , even with things as chaotic as they are at this time , with the prospect , speaking politically , of their getting W orse , I venture to say that , outside of Senator Norris , practically none of them will run out and organize a third-party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Repuhlican Party , nominally  --  and go along with the crowd . They remember what happened to Senator La Follette in 1024 , and what the result of the Roosevelt third-party movement was in 1912 . " The weak point in these threats of a third-party movement , unless a presidential candidate who fits their individual and group speciheations is nominated by the Republicans , is that the threat of a third party is not based on any new , broad or vital principle of government , or set of principles for regenerating the present government , and rests largely on mere opposition to the majority . Three-quarters of it is based on differences over methods rather than on differences on underlying principles . To be sure , there are some proponents of government ownership , and so on , but , in general , the thing simmers down to personal vanity and personal animus . " I was talking to a. newspaperman the other day , and he summed up the attitude of most of these third-party rumblers by making an application of the old Dana definition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is not . news , but if a man bites a dog . that is news . ' He said : ' When these insurgents bite a President or a party , that is independence ; but when a President or a party bites back , that is a constitutional outrage . ' That 's about the size of it . " And the colonel paused to light . a fresh cigar . " Suppose , " I said , " there is a movement for a third party after the Republican convention , and in case Mr. Hoover is renominated . " " All right , " said the colonel , " I suppose that . " " Who will lead it ? " " Now , my son , you are asking a question that can only be answered by a guess . Naturally , as the three outstanding of the oppositionists , the assumption would be that either Borah , Norris or Johnson would be the leader . Borah I conceive to be out of the question , for he is generally offside only between seasons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required personal magnetism , and Johnson has no particular standing save as a forceful individualist . As a matter of fact , none of t he men in this insurgent group has any but limited qualifications for the leadership of such a cause , no matter what their individual talents may be . If it comes down to that , nor has any combination of them . " I think the lime is ripe for another essay at a third party , or a realignment of the old parties , and I have maintained for years that , ultimately , we shall have in this country , instead of the two present major parties , a Lib-eral Party and a . Conservative Party ; but . I have no idea that any attempt that will he made i his year , if any is made , Will he founded on any such rational division as that . The only symptoms of such an endeavor are found in I he vast literature and exhorlation from the theorists that the situations in the old parties are in great . disorder and that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at the present time not subject to reorganization either . " Cause That Lacks Leadership " This leaves us with the only bases for such a movement  --  the basis of opposition , mostly , and the basis of the troubles of the public . The first consideration could amount to nothing save a possible diversion of enough votes from the Republican candidate to elect . the Democrat , as was the case when Roosevelt ran in 1912 . The second is tenable only on the foundation of leadership , on the appearance of one man , supported by many other strong men , to fire the imagination of the people and cause them to shake off the usual sloth of their politics . " No ordinary man , no man now in sight could do it . The great difficulty with movements of this sort in the United States is that it is almost impossible to get the people all mad at the same thing at the same time . To do any damage to the existing parties other than the diversion of votes , or to elect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands and will stand next fall , is not in the cards . We have no such leader as is required . " When an Issue Made a Man " Could n't one be developed ? " I asked . " Have you forgotten Bryan in 1896 ? " " I have not . You seem to assume that nobody knew anything about Bryan until he made his cross-of-gold speech in the Chicago convention in 1896 . A good many people knew about . Bryan . He had been in Congress . He was known as an orator . Moreover , it was n't Bryan who made the Free Silver issue ; it was the Free Silver issue that made Bryan . Point me out . even a potential Bryan among the public or semipublic men of the United States and show me where any such man can find an uncomplicated issue like Free Silver in this campaign , with all our national and international troubles and entanglements . Dig me up even a sixth carbon copy of a Roosevelt . The raw material for such a leader as a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great uprising of the people , such as would be necessary to get results , behind OitTord Pinchot , or Prof. . John Dewey , or George Norris , or Hiram Johnson , or even Borah , the most conspicuous of the lot . " Unless conditions change might- ; unless the politics necessarily involved becomes a crusade with the people , which is not at all probable , because the majority of our people are not politics-conscious ; unless the imagination and the temper of the people can he fired at . the same time from coast to coast , the thing would be the usual political failure . No theorist or political economist , no professorial solution maker , no book writer could do it. ; nor could any of the very ordinary politicians now in high place in this country . That job would . take red blood , personal faith and personal credit . with the people , a. definite stand of principles , and a higher quality of leadership than we have at present within our boundaries . " Therefore , when I say that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , familiar panacea idea I mean just t hat . None of them , in my day  --  which goes back to the 60 's  --  has panaceaed yet , and none of them will this time , for the two reasons I have given : First , because however admira.ble the ideas of the theorists may be they can not , in present conditions , be transmuted into political facts ; and , second , because the political threats of such reprisal on the two major parties are so entirely political that they will command no nation -- Wide upheaval . " The next President will be either a Republican or a Democrat , as the issue may determine , and the next party in power either the Democratic Party or the Republican . A man on horseback might get somewhere , but where is the man , and what would he use for a horse ? " After the colonel had put this most perplexing question , he paused to call his colored boy and instruct him as to certain matters of refreshment , and when these arrangements were satisfactorily concluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican origin ? " " Mostly , but not entirely , " he replied . " You see , the Democrats are in such an ecstatic state of self-hypnosis over what they think is a certain victory next fall that they have been standing closely ranked together in order that nobody shall be outside the largess limits when the plums are distributed after March fourth next year . However , I did note that the Hon. W. G. McAdoo , who was a very lively and well-supported contender for the presidential nomination in two Democratic National Conventions , looks dourly on the present situation in his party . After a trip to the East he returned to his home in Los Angeles and expressed it as his opinion that the time is ripe for revolt and the formation of a popular party  --  for an uprising of the people , in short . Mr. McAdoo did not offer himself as leader for this movement , hat he let . the potential uprisers know his name and address . " In a Hole of Others ' Digging " In any event. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominating conventions . Then , if the Democratic nominee does not suit Mr. McAdoo and his friends they may start something , for McAdoo still has considerable strength in the country . I have no intimation of his state of mind except what is shown in his statement , and the fact that he is a dry . On the other side , if the Republican nomination does not suit Senator Norris he may make the same endeavor , or he may not . Last time he contented himself with voting for Smith as a protest , but this year he seems to be somewhat more acrimonious . " " Are the Republican prospects any better than they were last time we had a. talk ? " I asked . " Not much . The Republicans are in a hole , and the tough part of their position is that they , speaking politically , did not do a half of the digging of it . Their hole was dug , in large part , by a combination of economic and other circumstances over which they had no control ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the people as excavators of the entire cavity . They can not escape this , and their greatest sustenance at present is the hope for better days . The entire party is in the dark , waiting for the sunrise . " I was greatly interested in the meeting of the - Republican National Committee a time ago . That was convocation based On-the well-enforced
