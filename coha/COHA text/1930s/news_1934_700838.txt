txt CLEVELAND , Oct. 4 . ? A far cry from happier days , the Buckeye campaign for Governor between Clarence J. Brown , Republican , for . mer Secretary of State , and Martin . L , Davey , Democrat , 1928 candidate , former Representative and New Dealer , was opened this week on the grim issue of bankruptcy facing cities and schools , beginning with New Year 's Day . Davey offered the issue and Brown . took it up . Davey is realist enough to admit that when the new 10-mill constitutional limitation to realty taxes becomes effective on Jan. 1 all present tax revenues will be approximately halved . There are many bankrupt municipalities and closed schools today on present revenues . The expiring Legislature will be asked once more to pass a sales tax , but expectations are not high , although retail organizations are dropping their fight on the proposed levy . Davey , therefore , has proposed that , in cases of emergency , all taxing subdivisions be granted a twoyear moratorium on payments of principal on bonded debt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of the press have called this " repudiation " and declare such a course would stab Ohio 's public credit rating . Davey says it is not repudiation to hold up payments for two yearst pending a settling of the tax issue . Frown declares two State funds , the teachers ' pension and workmen 's ' compensation , heavily invested in school and municipal bonds , would suffer seriously . He says he will keep the schools open , but believes in new taxes only after a considerable cut in the cost of the State government , which , he says , he can effect . Klan Raises Its Head . The Ohio Klan , which produced riots and National Guard calls in. this State as recently as 1925 , crept back into this campaign in connection with the school financial difficulties . Ohio parochial schools are badly off and Catholic leaders are pressing all candidates for public relief . There is a constitutional provision against public support of private schools , but a Klan lobbyist recently declared his organization would swing against Davey because some Catholics were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whether this issue will weave itself seriously into a campaign so far good tempered is to be seen . Davey has ignored the thrust . It was used in one section against him in the primary in which he won by a fairly decisive margin . The race seems close on the basis of the biennial straw vote by The Columbus Dispatch , the accuracy of which was praised in a survey of straw votes two years ago . With about 20,000 responses , Brown leads Davey by less than 1 per cent . If the poll is to be trusted on the Senatorship , former Governor Vie Donahey , who won the Democratic nomination with hardly an effort , has a lead of better than 2 to 1 over Senator Simeon D. Fess . The latter is making an aggressive speaking campaign against the New Deal . Donahey made his first speech this week and is apparently saving his fire . Banking Reform Comes Up . An issue of reform bank legislation which has been promised for ' the next Assembly may get into the Gubernatorial campaign , because an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modification . of existing banking laws which , in part , may be popularly interpreted as a loosening instead of the tightening which politicians have been pledging ever since the disastrous bank closing in Northern Ohio in 1932 and 1933 . The recommendations include dropping the liability assessment of bank stockholders , pro-. hibiting interest on demand deposits and giving more administrative and punitive powers to the State Bank Superintendent . A legislative committee working on the same problems may report this Fall and is said to favor much harsher reforms . The public is in. a mood to weigh financial issues this Fall , and what the new Governor may do with the banking laws is sure of respectful attention . in Cleveland , 1roledo and Akron , where banks were hardest hit . Davey is declaring himself in solid with the program of the national administration . Donahey hag considerable sympathy with it , reserves his independence and defies the " reactionary classes " which , he says , always fought him when he was elected Governor . Senator Fess will go down , if he goes down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to State issues .
