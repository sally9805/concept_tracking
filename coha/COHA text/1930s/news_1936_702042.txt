txt Governor Landon 's Labor Views For one reader , at least , Mr. Landon protests too much to be effective in his plea on labor . If labor is to organize in unions , government can not close its eyes in blind neutrality that borders close upon sophistry  --  but must , like any umpire , make decisions , take sides and render judgments . Judging by the enthusiasm with which Landon 's labor views were received by many who hate unions and unionism with a bitter hatred , labor is likely to find its struggles opposed if Landon becomes President . By some peculiarity of reasoning , a government which is friendly to unionism is termed paternalistic as opposed to a government that , observing the dictates of strict neutrality , becomes the most partial and biased of all . Mr. Landon in trying to retain an open mind is likely to succeed only in supporting an open shop ; in clumsy efforts at neutrality to precipitate serious labor conflicts . F. A. SIEVERMAN Jr . New York , Aug. 1 , 1936.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
