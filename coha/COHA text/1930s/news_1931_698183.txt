The Executive and the Idaho Senator frankly discussed the political trend in this country as well as international questions . In the course of their talk on foreign affairs , especially with regard to the disarmament conference at Geneva in February , it was disclosed that the President viewed with sympathy Senator Borah 's proposal for a naval holiday and that the Senator agreed with the President on reducing the naval budget . In the domestic field the Senator pictured the voters of the West as in revolt over the economic situation , particularly in agriculture , and , while he did not ascertain that the administration had any new farm legislation proposals , he said that he intended to press for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood to be in agreement on prohibition .

Borah Calls Parley Inevitable , Senator Borah gave no indication that President Hoover favored a monetary conference or that he Intended to issue a call for one , as requested in a Senate resolution . But the Senator said that sentiment for such a conference was increasing and voiced the belief that pressure would become so strong as other nations followed Great Britain , Sweden , Norway and Denmark in suspending the gold standard that the United States would be forced to join in one . " I have suggested to the President the calling of an international monetary conference , " Senator Borah said . " I would prefer to have it called by the President , but if it was called by any leading nation I would be satisfied . " It is perfectly clear to me that not only would Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call it , great Britain would be there on the front seat . And all the other leading nktions would be represented . " There has been an impression that the silver conference was advocated only by the Western Senators , but that is not true . " Sir Henry Deterding has repeatedly advocated it and only recently came out with a very powerful argument for it . Winston Churchill , in a speech on the floor of the House of Commons , said it was of the most immediate concern . Mr. Darling of the London Midland Bank is also an authority for the statement that there can be no economic recovery until the monetary question is nettled .

The fact is that the business of the world is appreciating that gold is depreciating in supply . " Undoubtedly the fact that a large . share of the world has departed from the gold standard , is hurting our trade . If an international conference would agree on a ratio between gold And silver and make silver a legal tender , . it would be very useful and helpful to : economic recovery . " About 800,000,000 ' people in the world use silver . Since 1925 , the purchasing power of these people has gone down to about one-fourth of what it was . In my opinion , an increasing number of the people of this country are losing confidence in gold . " I do n't believe in pegging the price of silver and I do n't believe one nation can establish bi- rnetalism alone . I believe it can be settled by an international conference . I have no doubt but what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definite ratio with gold with absolute success . " Borah for 14-to-1 World Ratio .
