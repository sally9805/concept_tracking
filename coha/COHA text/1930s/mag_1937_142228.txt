To good Roman Catholics , Lent means 40 days of fast , abstinence , prayer , penitential works . Three Sundays before it begins , all churches are draped with mourning purple in memory of Christ 's Passion . A change occurs on Laetare ( " Rejoice " ) or Rose Sunday , when the Church bids her faithful for a day to look beyond the sorrows of Lent to the rejoicings of the coming Easter and when rose vestments and draperies are substituted for purple . To Pope Pius XI in Vatican City , Laetare Sunday last week was especially a day for rejoicing . With use of his varicose-veined legs partially restored , the Holy Father performed the ancient Laetare ceremony of Blessing the Golden Rose . <P> As a mark of favor , Popes once bestowed finely-wrought golden roses upon churches , cities , monarchs .

Last Sunday a sheaf of gold blooms in a silver vase was brought into the Pope 's apartment , placed upon a candlelit table . Vested in rose garments , Pius XI prayed over the Rose , incensed it , poured balsam and musk into a tiny cup in its centre . The Golden Rose will be presented to Italy 's Queen after Easter by Monsignor Borgongini Duca , Papal Nuncio to Italy . <P> In the U.
