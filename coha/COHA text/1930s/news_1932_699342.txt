txt S. S. Taylor , managing director of Rholtana Corp. , sailed yesterday an the S. S. Majestic . The same ship carried the . liatariga representatives , Fernard Plsart and Camille Gutt . Producers have given up hope of any yielding by Roan Antelope 's representatives in - their demands , and the conference is virtually ended . The only thing that can save it is a last  --  isniaute yielding of Roan Antelope in its demand for 63,000.000 pounds as its quota for 1933 . The producers have let Roan Antelope representatives know for several days that they were willing to give them an increase in their quota to 54,600,000 pounds . They can see no justihcation of any higher quota for Roan Antelope . Representatives of Roan Antelope Copper Mines states that he sees no possibility of any agreement with other copper producers as to Roan 's rate of operation in 1933 . The other producers also feel that no compromise is probable . Mr. Storke issued a statement late yesterday denying that Roan Antelope was responsible for the failure of the conference . Started ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copper producers tret together in regard to a curtailment accord next year is unfortunate . At the first meeting last week it seemed that the copper producers would be in complete accord as to curtailment . However . the situation changed when the letter from Roan Antelope 's representative was receive0. demanding that Roan 's 1933 quota be increased to 93,000,000 pounds including its 64 , / , ' , of Mufilira 's quota , from the 46,750.000 pounds accorded it in 1932 . This demand the copper producers found impossible to grant . After parleys with officials of American Metal Co .. largest stockholder in Roan Antelope . and who were representing Roan Antelope in the discussions , it was decided to have Arthur D. Storke , managing director of Roan Antelope , come here to outline Roan Antelope 's position more clearly as the other producers were unable to understand on what basis Roan Antelope demanded such a large increase in its production . Mr. Storke arrived last Tuesday . From his discussions with the quota committee it became evident that Roan Antelope 's claim to the increased quota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself should be granted 10 ' ; : - . greater quota than the whole Rhokana Corp . The Rhokana quota is 60,000,000 pounds of copper a year on the basis of 20% of maximum yearly capacity , the rate of operation for the participants in the curtailment accord for 1932 . Consequently . Roan Antelope demanded a 1933 quota of 66,000,000 pounds for its Roan mine and 17,000,000 pounds more for its 64% share of Mufilira 's quota , making the 83,000,000 figure . Roan Antelope claimed also that Rhokana was not entitled to a quota as high as 60,000.000 pounds . Roan alleged that while its mill had found the ore in Roan mine such as to be able to crush and treat 10% more than it was designed for , and had proved itself able to recover more copper than estimated , the Rhokana ore had proved more difficult to crush and to treat than preliminary tests indicated . For that reason , and others , it contended , the Rhokana quota should not be 60,000.000 pounds . American producers were nonplussed by the demand for a 10% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not justified . They ' tried to find some justification for the demand by examination of the Roan Antelope mills ' operations and capacities . After study of all data available to them , the other producers came to the conclusion that Roan 's ore had proved easier to crush and easier to concentrate than had been estimated and were willing to increase the rating of the Roan Antelope 's maximum capacity to 168.000,000 pounds a year from 150,000,000 pounds agreed to by Roan Antelope 's engineers when the 1932 capacity ratings were made . This increased capacity was arrived at by granting a daily treatment capacity of 9,000 tons of ore and a recovery of 58 pounds of copper a ton to the ore . This was as high an extraction as the mill has as yet made , and the tonnage is higher than any crushing yet shown by the plant , it is said . This increased capacity rating would have given Roan Antelope a quota , including its 64 ' " of Mufilira. , of 54,600,000 pounds for 1933 . Roan Firm In Refusal This proposal proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had with the Roan representatives they refused to make any concession in their 83,000,000 pounds demand . Felicien Cattier , president of Union Miniere du Haut Katanga , who sailed last week for Europe . stated , on leaving that in case no agreement was reached it was highly probable that Katanga 's output be increased in the near future . It is underetood that the Belgian government . which owns a 64. ' , ; interest in Katanga , desires that Katanga 's output be increased to 100,000 tons a ytar , or practically double present output . It has also been intimated that Rhokaiaa 's output will be increased in case Roan Antelope adheres to its present output . It is believed that some other companies such as the Canadian . may also increase output . The South American companies are unlikely to increase output at present , the trade believes . Further Price Decline Feared General opinion in the industry is that foreign price of copper must decline to new lows . As no company operating at anywhere near present rates of product:on can cover expenses on copper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probable that if foreign price goes to 4 cents , as many feel is likely , there must follow early an awakening of the various producers to the impossibility of the situation Many observers feet that while the present conference apparently must end without results , producers after a few weeks of low nieces abroad will see the wisdom of cooperation . especitely if domestic price holds armind present level . All producer , are willing to held output to 1,132 rate of output in 1933 except Roan Antelope . Foreign copper price is f35 a long ton , equivalent to approximately 5 025 cents a pound , c.i.f . European base ports . This compares with 5 15 cents Thursday . In the domestic market there has also been a slight easing in price . While copper for December shipment is still 5 cents a pound , delivered , first quarter 1933 . shiprnents are obtainable at 51 , , cents in sufficient volume to satisfy present demand . which has shrunk because of failure to reach any accord in the curtailment conference .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
