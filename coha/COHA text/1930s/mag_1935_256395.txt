Retired from active service since January , little General Maxime Weygand , favorite of Marshal Foch and onetime Inspector General of the French Army , emerged from obscurity last week to take part in the ceremony of relighting the Eternal Flame under the Arc de Triomphe . He was greeted with wild cheers . One passer-by refused to take his hat off . That started a fist fight . Nationalists in the crowd suddenly began to shout : " Put Weygand in Power ! Weygand for France ! " His admirers nearly tore for the clothes off the little soldier , forced police to hustle him to safety . It was a small but significant sample of France 's current temper . Across the river in the Palais Bourbon porters were filling all the inkwells and placing a large brass dinner bell on the Speaker 's desk , for the most powerful , least responsible legislative body in the world , the Chamber of Deputies , was about to meet . Every Frenchman knew what they were faced with : an immediate budget deficit of ten billion francs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , keystone of Europe 's gold bloc , to tremble on the verge of devaluation . Either the Chamber must swallow its pride , vote extraordinary powers to the Flandin ministry or else the Cabinet must fall and France head into another inflation like that of 1925-26 . <P> One Frenchman in every 20 holds some sort of Government job . Deputies are elected for four years , can throw out any cabinet at will and neither hell nor high water can budge them .

But could it be stopped ? With exports limp and the franc dropping on foreign exchange , the Bank of France was last week forced to the extraordinary action of raising the discount rate twice within three days , first from 2.5% to 3% , then to 4% . <P> With his broken arm still in a cast , hulking Premier Flandin held daily bedside conferences with elderly , crop-headed Finance Minister Louis Germain-Martin and Governor Jean Tannery of the Bank of France . In 1926 white-chinned old Raymond Poincar had been able to halt a similar crisis by increasing taxes , by floating a heavy loan on the Government tobacco monopoly . But in national prestige Premier Flandin was no Poincar . <P> To the rescue at this point went paunchy Edouard Herriot , onetime Premier , and leader of the Radical Socialists . He promised the Goverment the full support of his party , keystone of the Flandin government . Since Premier Flandin was still too sick to face the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him this week , with the following proposals :
