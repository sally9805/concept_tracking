IF THREE attendances at the theater are sufficient to make a dramatic critic , one visit to a boxing match makes a prizefight expert . As a matter of fact , the average male  --  and female , too  --  has hardly seen his first exchange of punches before he is yelling with the rest of the fans : " Use your left ! Jab him ! Hit him downstairs ! He do n't like it down there ! " And by the time the bouts are over and he is leaving , he has already become violently and positively opinionated as to the winners , the losers and the obvious astigmatism of the judges and the referees in naming the victors . Looking at a prize fight and knowing at what to look , or to recognize what you are seeing , is either as simple as that , or maybe we 're all wrong and the thing is complex and difficult . Sometimes when I pick up the paper and read two totally different accounts of the same prize fight written by two experts of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting more than ten feet away from each other during the soiree , I begin to have my doubts as to the simplicity of the affair . I know that my views on a prize fight were always right , but I could never understand how the other experts could go so far wrong as even to suggest that Young Slugnutty might have won , when it was quite obvious to any half-wit , including myself , that Kayo Stumbledogs was out in front all the way . Boxing is really one of the most elementary of all sports to understand , because it involves only two men , there are but few rules , and the object of the game is fairly obvious . The two men are trying to injure each other . But one still beholds some marvelous things when the judges ' slips are collected and made public , as they are today . One judge has given Young Slugnutty nine rounds , called two even and awarded the other four to Stumbledogs . His colleague , vis- &-vis,; somehow has arrived at the conclusion that Stumbledogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was entitled to but one . And the referee is liable to have noted eight rounds as even , three for Stumbledogs and four for Slugnutty . How , then , does one look at a fight ? What should one watch for ? How does one tell who is winning and who is taking a licking ? Come on , boys and girls , gather around and let 's get this thing settled . Our system may not be the same as that of our neighboring expert , but we thought of it first .. Let the other guy go and write his own article . In spite of some of the miracles of motion and delivery observed and described by radio announcers of prize fights , such as the overhand right uppercut and the left chop to the body , the catalogue of blows and punches is small , limited , easy to learn and know , and their variants are very few . The Jab  --  Punch of Marty Purposes T HERE is the left jab and the left hook , the right cross and the right hook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left uppercut , and that is all . There are a few variants such as a chop , or a right swing  --  Max Baer 's favorite punch , in which he wound up and fired his right fist at an opponent 's head like an outfielder trying to throw a man out at home plate  --  but they are all merely minor variants of the hook . And that is really all you can do to a man with your fists . And curiously , you will see very few boxers in the ring who include every punch in their repertoire . Usually they are either straight punchers or hookers . Jack Dempsey was strictly a hooker , and probably never threw a straight punch in his Life . On the other hand , Joe Louis can serve you up anything you like or that seems called for by the situation . Gene Tunney knew every punch in the book , though he never delivered them as naturally or with such speed as does Louis . On the other hand , a straight left and a straight right cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long way . The left jab is the simplest and most effective punch , and the hardest one to avoid . It is delivered on a beeline by straightening out the bent loft arm ; if possible , with the force of the left shoulder behind it . It drives the fist straight into an opponent 's body or face , with the laudable purpose ( a ) of scoring a point , ( b ) flattening his nose , or irritating him by making it bleed , ( c ) cutting his face , or reopening or aggravating a wound . ( d ) shocking him , or stunning him , or knocking him off balance , or bringing his guard up or down  --  in other words , preparing him for an application of the more lethal and damaging right hand . A man is rarely knocked down or out with a left jab , though it has been done , particularly if he is already off balance . Ernie Schaaf was knocked down and out and later died from a left jab that Primo Camera hit him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a bout with the flu , he had already absorbed a considerable pounding , and it was probable that a cerebral hemorrhage had begun before that final blow was struck . The jab is supposed to be delivered , then , straight from the shoulder with the fist cloSed , but some of of a shock to me when they suddenly collapsed and lay on the deck , twitching faintly . The uppercut is likewise self-descriptive . It is , in effect , a hook , but is delivered starting from the waistline in an ascending curve . Its destination is the point of the chin of the party of the other part . It is delivered more often with the right hand than with the left , and is a valuable punch to use against a man who bulls his way close in a semierouch with his arms forming a shield in front of his face . Short uppercuts are also used in close to jolt a man , addle his brains and keep him from making too many rosy plans for the future . They are merely disturbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whereas the full uppercut , well-timed , can refrigerate the recipient nicely . The only chap I ever heard of who could bit you with a short inside right uppercut and knock you out with it was Li'l ' Artha  --  Jack Johnson . And this about ends the category of punches . Some confusion is sometimes caused by the habit of naming punches after the parts of the anatomy to which they are applied , such as the solar-plexus punch , the kidney punch , or the rabbit punch , or the boys , if they can get away with it , favor the glove open a little , in a maneuver known as the left jab to the eyeball . As they lash out , they stick the thumb in the opponent 's eye . While he blinks helplessly and tries to get his sight back , they step hack , apologize handsomely , and then quickly hit him on the chin with the right and put him out of his misery  --  a very pretty and highly favored artifice . Since , in the orthodox stance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left arm extended , but slightly bent , right hand cocked at his chin or chest or wherever it is most convenient and natural for him to carry it , his left side is closest to his opponent , and a straight line , even in the screwy boxing game , still being the shortest distance between two points , the fast straight left jab is the first , surest and safest punch to land . Also it is the punch that least exposes the deliverer to return favors from his opponent , especially when skillfully and properly delivered . You will remember , perhaps . from Herr Max Sehmeling 's account of his brawl with Joe Louis , that by observing Joe in a fight he " saw zomesings " ? which was that Joe made a fatal error in his delivery of the left jab  --  that after depositing one or two , he dropped his left hand , leaving the path open for a whistling right counter to the nerve centers . A smart boxer never drops his left hand . Companion to the left jab , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight right cross , fired from the chest on a dead line , with all the power of the shoulder and the right side of the body behind it , including a slight pivot and follow-through . When it is well-timed , aimed and delivered , and lands on a vital spot , it is Katy-bar-the-door for the recipient . Again , because of that geometry business  --  the straight line and the two points  --  it is the fastest and hardest punch in the textbook , and the most difficult one to avoid . Gene Tunney had one of the best straight right crosses in the business . Schmeling has a fine one that he drops down from the chest . James J. Braddock , our incumbent heavyweight champion , has a pretty good one himself , and the cafe-au-laid Massa Louis has a lovely article that moves about a foot and arrives special delivery and equipped with a little sign reading " Do Not Disturb . " The Hook  --  Deceptive Dynamite T HE left and right hooks describe themselves , Here the fist , is not thrown straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body . When delivered perfectly , a pivot and follow-through go with it , with the left or right side of the body and all of the weight thrown in behind it . It is a much heavier and moredamaging punch , delivered with the left hand , than the jab , and a good left-hooker can knock his opponent bowlegged with a proper application . Again Mr. Louis comes to mind as a proper exponent . Many a gentleman have I seen him put on the floor with his left hook . When the gentleman gets up he is ready , nay , practically eager , for the right . It comes almost as a relief and surcease from trouble . The use and value of a book is obvious . As it is thrown in a curve , it will curl around a guard . It is frequently a. question of style . Some gentlemen who protect themselves against jabs are more amenable to hooks , and vice versa . And the hook has the added value of power . Dempsey , as I have indicated , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crouch coupled with his unforgettable feline weave was to gain leverage for it . Sharkey had to hook with his right hand because he had what is known as a tennis elbow , which made it impossible for him to straighten out his right arm . Mickey Walker was , in effect , a little Dempsey , and hooks were his most dangerous punches . Among little men , Billy Petrolle , also known as the Fargo Express , had a hook that was absolute dynamite . He seemed almost to be bestowing a loving caress upon his victims , a sort of affectionate pat on the side of the head , so smooth , so sweet and mild that it always came as something the one-two . The one-two is merely a combination of a left and right , but delivered at speed , with the left leading and the right following immediately . The left is , in a manner of speaking , the preoperative sedative , the right the anesthetic . The patient feels much better the next morning . Rabbit punches are little cuffing blows , supposedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of the neck , and so called because rabbits are often killed this way . It does n't do a human being any good either . It looks harmless when , in a clinch , a fighter cuffs another on the neck . It does n't score points , but it does serve to keep him nicely jarred . The more constantly a fighter is being hit , the less chance he has to think , and lay nefarious schemes . The solar plexus is a particularly vulnerable spot just below the sternum where the ribs join , and is usually best hit with a short hook . Constant pounding on the flank where the kidneys are located has a weakening effect , which becomes apparent late in a fight , as do heavy blows over the heart delivered in the early rounds . So much for offensive movements . The matter of defense is even simpler . There are four ways of stopping a punch  --  blocking , slipping , ducking , and with your chin . Most modern fighters favor the last-named as being the simplest . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially if it does n't seem to be loaded , ( Continued on Page 36 ) is a good defensive move , or rather defensive-offensive maneuver , because it brings the deliverer in close and sometimes lays him open for a more lethal reply , or counter . Blocking is done with the glove , the forearm , the elbow and the shoulder , and is one of the prettiest things to see in boxing , along with the slipping of a punch . It corresponds to the parry in swordplay . Right-hand punches are picked off with the left hand , and vice versa . Blows aimed at the head are caught on the glove , or pushed aside with the wrist or forearm , and sometimes a slight turn of the body , if it is fast enough , will catch the blow on the shoulder instead of on the chin . Gene Tunney was a beautiful blocker , as was Jack Sharkey , when he wanted to box , and nobody ever caught a punch prettier than Benny Leonard among the boys of modern times . It calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coupled with a line eye , to react in time to get your arm up to block . And there are two reasons why this is important in a fight . It protects the features from wear and tear , and may save you waking up in the dressing room , and it . also scores points heavily . The average person who gets steamed up over watching a prize fight usually forgets the important part played by defense on the judge 's score sheet . If a man displays a fine defense in a round of boxing , picking off punches right and left , and then lets one by that deposits him for a few seconds on the seat of his panties , the spectator remembers only the knockdown . The judges usually do , too , but they should n't . Leg Work Makes the Boxer But if eyes and arms and coordination are important in defense , the legs are even more so , because they-play the greater part in the art known as " slipping , " which is to get away from a punch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerily past the chin , or by moving inside it. , especially if it is a hook , so that it curls harmlessly around the neck . Tommy Loughran , one of the greatest boxers of modern times , was practically unbeatable until age dulled his legs a little and they could no longer get him back out of trouble with the same speed and instant reaction . He was lightning-fast at jabbing with his left , and then pulling back from the counter . When his legs went back on him , he could n't pull away from those counters any more , and the boys began to tag him . It is more difficult to watch slipping than blocking , because some of the boys reduce it to such a fine art that it does not become apparent .. You can see a punch whip into a glove ready to catch it. , but one of those quarter-inch evasions , either in or out , frequently looks as though the other fellow were missing rather than as if his opponent was making him miss . Ducking is exactly what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of slipping , except that the fighter bobs down and lets the punch sizzle over his head . Sometimes , if he does n't duck far enough , be is sorry , because a punch aimed for his chin will land on his temple , with an unpleasant result . There is one further defensive move , which takes place in a clinch and which , depending on which way you bet , is called either " tying a man up " or " holding . " Infighting , or hitting at close quarters , is important in the scoring and can also do a lot of damage , and by gaining leverage , or pushing on the free arm of an opponent , an experienced man can keep him from punching in close . In the Len Harvey-John Henry Lewis fight for the **30;1182;TOOLONG at Wembley Stadium in London last fall , Harvey , the English challenger , held on for eight out of the ten rounds , but . the Englishmen all allowed that he was tying Lewis up very cleverly . The viewpoint is rather important . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can take place in a boxing match . However , it is their application and one 's evaluation of them that sends the spectator out into the night mumbling to himself . For , to begin with , there are two fundamental ways of looking at a brawl . One is to consider it a boxing contest , in which points are scored for leading , scoring and clever defense , and the other is to regard it as a prize fight . in which two parties are trying to harm each other as much as possible in the allotted space of time , and in which the winner is adjudged to be the one who has inflicted the most damage upon the other . It is sometimes a little trying , if you belong to this school , to see some battered artist with one eye closed , his face swollen and bleeding from a number of wounds , raised from his chair by his seconds , so that he may receive the palm at the expense of an opponent who still has his beauty . Anyway , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kayo Jones and see what there is to he seen as the battle develops . You are going to be a real expert now , so you might as well start from the beginning and size the men up as they stand in the center of the ring and take their instructions from the referee . Never mind their faces , which will be impassive . Steal a glance at their tickers . If one of them is trying to kick its way out from beneath its owner 's ribs , you are looking at a nervous man who may not be feeling any too good about the forthcoming encounter . One Mile I asked Jack Sharkey what . was the idea of that phony hypnotic glare with which he transfixed an opponent during the **25;1214;TOOLONG period . He tapped me on the left side of the chest and said , " Hypnotic nothing , boy . That 's where I 'm looking . At their hearts . If it is n't beating nice and slow and steady , I know what to do . " They go to their corners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jones are a couple of experienced boys and not to be caught napping , so there will be none of that sudden letting go of an unexpected right hand ; though sometimes it works , especially with an experienced fighter . It is known as a " sucker punch . " Tom Heaney did it to Sharkey in their fight , and got away with it . But Smith and Jones will use that first round to learn all they can about each other , to try things and to test out their weapons . And while they are doing that we can find out something about the boys ourselves . Thirty seconds will not have passed before you will know something about the styles of the two men . Jones is aggressive  --  wants to lead and score and make the fight . Smith is strictly a counter fighter  --  wants to wait for his opponent to come to him , take advantage of his mistakes and score upon the openings left by Jones as he leads . And so it will be a pretty fair fight . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in there , each waiting for the other to come to him and make a move . This sort of thing is a sure cure for insomnia , and no intelligent matchmaker will put one on . But they still happen . Of course , the happiest combination is when two young men who will lead climb through the ropes . A lend is an attack . It may be a left jab , or a left hook , or even a sucker punch with the right hand . But a fighter who leads definitely commits himself . By leading and trying to score , he moves into the danger zone and lays himself open to reprisals . Therefore , the leader is immediately given the edge , on the score sheet , over the chap who hangs back and waits and takes no chances . Aggressiveness is a definite factor in weighing and judging a fight . And no fighter can conceal his style very long . Thirty seconds or a minute is sufficient , and you know that Jones is going to try to make the fight and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The theme of the piece has been announced and your problem as a spectator has already been very much simplified . But leading is not sufficient to give Jones the upper hand . It wo n't do for him merely to make menacing motions in the direction of Smith . He must land the punch to score . And he must avoid the counters . And here is where the fight goes into balance again , because a counter is usually a much harder punch than a lanai . Just one hard counter smash that splits an eye , or a lip , or shivers a man to his toes will offset five light , left-hand scoring taps . It is Jones , the aggressor and chance taker , who fills your eye at first . He is in there doing something . But what ? Is ho landing his left ? Are they merely annoying flicks for points , or do they carry the solid shock of bone and muscle ? And are they landing squarely , or are they just a little short ? The first few minutes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off in his timing for one reason or another . If he is , you can figure that he is in for a very unpleasant evening . Because his opponent finds it out too . Is Jones leading for the head or the body ? If for the body , you know immediately that lie has found that Smith is carrying his guard a little too high for Jones to connect with a solid right-hand smash , and , therefore , Jones is doing something about it . When Joe Louis fought Primo Camera , he found it highly inconvenient and too much of an effort to try to punch at Primo 's head around those high-held tree trunks of arms . He , therefore , thumped his middle like a man beating the kettledrum in a Wagner opus . Camera had to bring his arms down and stop that or have his middle torn out . Louis then shifted to the head , hit him on the chin and knocked him silly . It was just as simple as that . The Studious Counter  --  FIghter But there is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meantime ? And so we forget about Jones for a little while , which means a minute or so , and study Smith . Is he taking Jones ' leads because he can not avoid them or because he wants to take them in order to counter ? You can tell immediately . If Smith 's head is snapping back from jabs , and he is back on his heels and off balance , and his counter jabs or swings are wide or short , he is having a very unpleasant time , and is beginning to wish he were elsewhere . But if he is on balance and there is a cool and calculating look in his eye as Jones ' left fist bashes into his face , then he has the situation under control , is measuring his distance , studying Jones and his little habits of movement , and is laying up something unhealthy for Jones . You will remember , as a perfect example of this sort of thing , Schmeling 's own account of how he beat Louis . He knew he would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to hit him with a right , counter . It cost Schmeling the temporary sight of one eye , because Louis closed it for him . But the exchange was all in Schmeling 's favor . He swapped a couple of pawns to checkmate Louis and knock him out . And the counter fighter is always running the risk of suffering some hurt that will disable him and keep him from functioning perfectly . But above all , is he landing his counters , or ripostes ? Tho only excuse for a counter fighter at all is constant and effective retaliation . He must forever keep replying to the questions put to him by his opponent 's ( Continued on Page 41 ) I Continued from Pal . 36 ) leads , and his answers must carry weight and logic . And there is no logic that clears the air as quickly and ends an argument as conclusively as a straight right-hand smash to the chin . If counter-puncher Smith is fighting from a galloping retreat  --  that is , if he is back-pedaling  --  he must be scoring on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In short , he must be doing something . Merely wearing an insouciant , devil-may-care expression on his face wo n't do . And above all , he must be doing it all through the round to hold himself even with Jones ' leading and aggressiveness . Do n't let those clock watchers fool you  --  the boys who loaf for two and a half minutes and then put on a furious burst of fighting the last thirty seconds of each round . And , of course , here is where the difference of opinion comes in , and again a lot depends on which man you favor . If Jones is your man , you will be entranced over the series of light jabs with which he is painting Smith 's features . And if Smith is your fancy , you will laugh at Jones ' light taps  --  Smith is n't laughing at them  --  and revel in the occasional hard , damaging counters that Smith lands . No two people will ever get together on that . By the next round you ought to know something about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a long fight . In a short fight  --  anything at eight rounds or under  --  the boys will either try for a quick knockout , or try to pile up enough points to win . But over the ten , twelve and fifteen round stretch , a fighter can inaugurate a campaign in the early rounds that will bear fruit in the later ones . And so you watch for any particular types of punches that are repeated . Is Smith concentrating on driving his right hand to the heart ? If he manages to keep it up for four or five rounds , Jones is liable to come all undone in the twelfth or thirteenth round and collapse from the effects of what , in the earlier rounds , looked like a harmless punch . Tunny hit Tom Heeney over the heart in the early part of their fight , and toward the end , Heeney was suddenly unable to react and defend himself any longer . Continued pounding of a kidney may have the same effect , not to mention the psychological effect of the intense pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fifteen or twenty minutes , every subsequent blow is like a knife being driven into his side . He becomes overanxious to protect himself from further punishment of that nature , exposes his chin and  --  curtains . Riding Out the Storm But Smith may be doing some concentrating of his own . He may find that his left jab is landing , and so he keeps parking it on Jones ' right eye . Unless Jones manages to do something about that and devise a defense against it , he is going to be in trouble in the later rounds , because either the eye will swell up and close , which means that he will have a blind side , or Smith will cut it , If the cut is on the lid , the blood will flow into the eye , and eventually the referee will stop it . Any kind of a bleeding cut is a handicap , because it draws the enemy fire , and there is something psychological about having to fight while bleeding . The sight and feel of one 's own gore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . always the priceless story of the English Fancy Dan who was having a swell time dancing around his opponent and outboxing him until said opponent hauled off and hit him a blowser squarely on the nose . The Fancy Dan stopped right where he was , put the thumb of his glove up to his wounded smeller , looked with great anguish at the sample of his life stream that came oft onto it , said , " That 's done it , " turned around , walked to his corner and right out of the ring . It is fairly simple to tell which fighter is landing the most punches , but judging their effectiveness is something else again . You watch their eyes if you are close enough . When that far-away look comes into them , as though they were listening to distant cathedral chimes , you can bet that the party of the first part has connected . The knees are telltale , too , but most significant of all is when a fighter , after taking a hard punch , makes a little forward movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checks himself and falls into a clinch . That man has been hurt . Fighters who are knocked back onto their heels or are sent staggering backward are rarely badly hurt . It usually means that they have been hit while off balance or while trying to " ride with the punch . " This is another self-descriptive boxing term and is used to indicate that a smart boxer has seen a punch coming that he knows he can neither block nor slip , so he does the next best thing  --  he starts to move in the same direction as the blow and rob it of some of its steam by riding with it .. A baseball catcher does the same thing with a speed-ball pitcher when he pulls his glove to him as soon as the ball hits it . The Symptoms of Defeat In the same manner , a fighter who is knocked down and goes over backward , landing in a half-sitting position , is rarely badly hurt . He can , if he wants to , get up and fight some more . But when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poleaxed. start climbing into your overcoat and reach for your hat . Because they do n't often get up , and when they do , they are helpless . The dead ones in battle fall faceforward too . And watch the ones who go over backward , too , because if they strike the backs of their heads against the deck in falling , they may give themselves a worse stunning than the punch did . Fighters who are knocked down and who climb to one knee and listen to the count of nine are all right and will get up in good shape . Fighters who immediately get to their feet after n knockdown are usually the ones who are badly hurt . They get up by instinct before they have to , because they are completely shaken loose from their processes of thinking . Many a man has been knocked out because he got up too soon . It looks like a stupid thing to do , on the face of it , but the spectator forgets that the stricken man 's brain is in complete chaos , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hear the referee or see the timekeeper . He knows only that he is on the floor , but not how long he has been there or how much more grace ho has . And so he gets up , finds that his legs have gone rubbery and staggers into the finisher . When a man gets up from a knockdown , watch his eyes and his legs . If his eyes are glazed , he is still very close to dreamland and will be unable to react in his own defense . And if his legs are shaking and threatening to cave in under him , he is done for , because his One means of escape is gone . It was Tummy 's legs that saved him in that seventh round with Dempsey in Chicago after the historic count . Gene 's focus was still a trifle fuzzy when lie got to his feet , but his legs were there , thanks to his superb condition . Instinct told him to move away from approaching disaster in the person of William Harrison , and his legs carried him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a lot to be seen in and learned from them . If Jones is digging away at . Smith 's middle with little short sharp pokes , in close , Smith is being damaged and weakened . A good infighter can tear a man apart . I have seen men go into a clinch looking fresh and unmarked , and come out looking as though they had been in an automobile accident . And heads play a great part in the infighting . If you do n't watch the clinches , you may miss as pretty a butt its you ever saw , and one that will turn the tide of battle , as the buttee emerges with blood streaming down his face from a gash over the eye . Everyone says , " Gee , how did that happen ? " If you watch the clinches. you 'll see . It is very often in the clinches that a man readies his opponent up for the final applications with sharp digs , short jolting uppercuts and overhand swings to the temple and side of the head . Always remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punches is accumulative . The apprentice fight fan often is puzzled by the fact that a punch that a fighter shook off successfully in the early rounds of a fight will suddenly knock him out in a later one . If you see a man absorbing a vicious beating about the head at the start of a contest , you may look for him to collapse before it is over . Constant shocks weaken his powers of resistance and damage his brain and nervous system until , finally , the breaking point is reached . It is a curious fact , too , in connection with this , that a fighter actually warms up to taking punishment . A fighter who is clipped on the chin in the first . round , when lie is cold , very often never recovers from the blow . After two or three rounds , he will take that same punch without flinching . Georges Carpentier used to kiss his English friends with that whizzing right hand of his immediately after the opening bell , and it was all over . I saw Jock McAvoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a left hook , the first punch of the fight , and Risk() never recovered . But remember . When you see a man take a steady pounding about the head from a series of short sharp blows that do not seem to be particularly lethal in power or effect , he is on his way out . The Jill.Reuealing Legs You can learn something from observing the way the boys go to their corners when the bell rings to end the round . If they drag their feet and walk without any spring , they have been hurt around the body . And if they walk with too much spring , or do a little pas sera ! , or kind of tack a little on the way to their stools , they have been hurt around the head and still are n't over the effects of it . The motion pictures of the Schmeling-Louis fight were amusing and instructive in this respect . While the fight was going on , Louis seemed to be all right ; the camera failing to register his distress until the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his corner that showed how much he had been hurt during the three minutes . And when he was finally knocked out , it was not from the effects of one or two hard // punches , but a collapse from the accumulative effect of the steady beating he had taken throughout the fight . But it is in the corners themselves , in that precious minute between rounds , that you will learn more than at any other time about the condition and chances of a fighter . Remember that his seconds are really experts , or they should be , and they know their man . You may not realize that he has been through a tough round and is wandering hand in hand with the Moon Princess down Queer Street , but his seconds know . The first tip-off is when they wait for him at the top of the steps with a sponge full of water , and let him have it in his face as he nears his seat . Now watch the seconds ' hands as they fumble in their pockets for medicaments , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are trembling , nervous and shaking , that young fighter is in trouble . What 's that ? An experienced second 's hands should n't shake . Brother , if you saw a hundredthousand-dollar meal ticket being punched full of holes , you 'd tremble , too , no matter how much experience you have had . Now watch what the boys do in the corner . Some of them will come right out and hold that bottle of smelling salts under the nose of the snoozing one and do n't care a hoot who sees it , but others , if the man is not too badly hurt , will try to sneak him a whiff sort of in passing , so that the other side wo n't catch on that he needed it . Repairs to cuts and bleeding noses are fairly obvious , but when you see them thumbing a boy 's temples and massaging the back of his neck , they are trying to dispel a few lingering cobwebs before sending him back to the wars . Also , the more frantic and agitated the seconds are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater his trouble . There are very few seconds who know enough to leave their man alone , except for necessary first aid , when he comes to his corner , after having been on the floor , or is dragged there when saved by the bell . A lot of seconds will finish the job of knocking a man out right in the corner . In the ' final rounds you may see them sneak him a drink out of a little medicine bottle . It is either spirits of ammonia , or brandy , or some other quick heart stimulant , designed to aid him in a last-round rally . The corners are always an infallible tip-off . Well , that 's about all . You 're an ex pert now . Now you go to a fight and come back and tell me.
