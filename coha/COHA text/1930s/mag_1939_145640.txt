Old Dr. John Dewey , the good grey philosopher , has spent his life exploring endless variations on a single theme : experience is the best teacher . Because he hitched William James 's pragmatism to Education and insisted that Education must make sense to modern society , John Dewey has exerted a great influence on 20th-century U. S. pedagogy . But he has lived to be 79 and " America 's Greatest Philosopher " without ever explaining how Education can make sense when a society does not . <P> That Dr. Dewey 's influence has also made for a certain fuzziness in academic thought was once more made evident last week when a group of his foremost followers , the three-year-old John Dewey Society , issued a yearbook. * <P> The book was written by ten famed Deweyite educators , among them Professors Harold Rugg and George S.

" To reduce this mouth-filling program to concrete terms and tell exactly how the schools may accomplish it without delay is not easy . It is , in fact , too difficult for Rugg &; Co . Their 530-page book reviews hopefully the spread of Progressive Education in the U. S. but concludes that Progressive Education has not gone far enough , that U. S. schools must function much more democratically and study contemporary problems much more realistically than any school does today . <P> Glooms Professor Counts : " One wonders whether the undermining of democracy . . . has not already proceeded so far that the battle is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEMOCRACY AND THE CURRICULUM-D .
