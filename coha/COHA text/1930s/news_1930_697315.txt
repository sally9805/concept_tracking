txt Dr. Louts I. DUBLIN 'S article in THE TIMES of Sunday upon the longevity of college men , based upon statistics gathered by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company , will provoke discussion and no doubt bring out clearly what occupations and habits are conducive to good health and long life . He would probably agree with Dr. LORAND of Carlsbad , who has said that if you desire to live to a great age the thing to do Is to become an inmate of an English almshouse . But Dr. DUBLIN would only have complicated his subject by treating of diet , the outdoor life and exercise . There are , indeed , no hard and fast rules for growing old , because the inheritance of a good constitution may often be set off against careful living in the computation of years up to SO and beyond . " The experi " ence of life insurance companies " often shows , " says Dr. DUBLIN , " that those who arrive at a ripe old " age are small and physically un " developed people . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown , Cornell , Dartmouth , Harvard , Wesleyan , Williams and Yale who furnished most of his statistics were intelligent enough to give more than the usual study to sensible living . In this respect , as In others , college graduates are " a picked body of men . " It will be highly pleasing to the college authorities to learn from Dr. DUBLIN that the honor men , as a rule , live longest . There is this statement : These honor men show an extraordinary longevity , which is three and a half years better than carefully selected insured lives , and a year better than for the longest-lived population group in ? the world  --  namely , the New Zealanders . Honor men , says Dr. DUBLIN , exhibited superior stamina " almost from the beginning . " Theirs was the moderate life , fairly free- from strain , mental or physical . The mor tality of the athletes was conspicuously greater , although up to 50 they seem to have stood comparison well with other college men . Two things about the athletes will occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduation they either drop out of competition in their specialties or go in for some sport with the energy that characterized them in college days . In either case the effect may not be good . Overstrain is common among athletic men , and they sometimes carry it into tlieir business pursuits . Dr. DUBLIN notes " exceptionally " favorable mortality of the men " graduating from the smaller col " leges , " Wesleyan , Amherst , Brown , Williams . Yale men showed the . highest mortality . The environment of the smaller colleges ? is almost rural . Dr. DUBLIN thinks their graduates may have an unusual span of life because many of them enter the ministry or become teachers . One fancies , however , that there is more of the habit-forming simple life at the smaller colleges . Dartmouth is a hill college , and yet the Mortality of her graduates , " and especially among her athletes , is an enigma . " There will be much comment upon Dr. DUBLIN 'S thoughtful paper and perhaps challenge of its implications .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
