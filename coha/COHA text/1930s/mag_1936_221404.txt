Rhode Island Democrats , who last year upset political tradition by taking control of the State Senate , in recent weeks have voted $100 bonuses right &; left to Rhode Island War veterans who failed to apply for them within the period originally set by law , ending in 1923 . Last week a straight-faced Republican State Senator introduced a bill to pay a $100 bonus to Sergeant Evael O. W. Tnesba of the Twelfth Machine Gun Battalion , asked unanimous consent for its immediate consideration . No objection was made and a Democrat Senator generously seconded the measure . It was passed instantly . When Republicans began to guffaw at the blind liberality of the majority , a shrewd Democratic Senator moved to reconsider the bill , had it referred to a committee for study . Only study necessary was to read the machine-gun sergeant 's name backward .
