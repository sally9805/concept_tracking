By last week it was abundantly clear that Fanny Brice 's big little husband , Billy Rose , merits some title-other than pressagents ' superlatives-to indicate his uniqueness as a showman . " Fair Doctor " might serve , with the understanding that the exposition managements which seek his services are not necessarily sick but simply want the shot-in-the-arm of financial confidence which the Rose technique provides . Last year when the Texas Centennial fair got under way at Dallas , Doctor Rose was called in by Fort Worth and encouraged , with a contract paying $1,000 a day for 100 days ( TIME , June 8 , 1936 ) , to unleash his imagination upon a rival fair . Mr. Rose carted his musical circus Jumbo down to Fort Worth and set up four or five other super-spectacles , including Sally Rand and her fans . So well satisfied were the city fathers of Fort Worth that they signed up Doctor Rose on the same terms for a second Frontier festival , which opens late this month . Lately Mr. Rose has been shuttling between Texas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another exposition-Cleveland . <P> Last year booming out of Depression , Cleveland was proud &; pleased that the Great Lakes Exposition which it whacked together in 80 days entertained 4,000,000 visitors with a total take of $15,000,000 . <P> One of the chief attractions was Dancer Toto Leverne , who appeared five times a day with no covering other than a stuffed swan ( TIME , July 13 ) . When it was decided to carry the fair into its second season , Manager Lincoln Griffith Dickey thought that perhaps hundreds of almost naked girls might be a better prop than one entirely bare one . The logical man to call in was Billy Rose . His contract was reported to be $100,000 for 101 days . <P> Part of the Rose genius is that he enters wholeheartedly into the atmosphere of the place where he is working . In Texas he rode around in chaps and a ten-gallon hat , wore a gold deputy sheriff 's badge , kept a two-headed snake and three live wolves in his office . When he arrived at the Cleveland fairgrounds and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he decided to stage a revue in and on the water , a sort of marine circus . He immediately had a dolphin tattooed on his chest and went around saying , " H2O , you so-and-so ! " <P> For his water spectacle , which he named BILLY ROSE 'S AQUACADE , the velvet-eyed little showman hired a handful of aquatic stars including Johnny ( " Tarzan " ) Weissmuller , Eleanor Holm Jarrett , who is at home with either water or champagne . Divers Aileen Riggin and Dick Degener and Stubby Kreuger , the diving clown . A floating stage 160 ft. wide , equipped with diving towers , was built in a shipyard and towed into place on the lake front by six tugs . While the Aquacade was going on , the stage was to be 60 ft. offshore from the block-long casino whence 4,000 spectators could watch . After the show the stage would move in on underwater runways so close that guests could step aboard and dance to the music of big-name bands . Rose had his usual staff to carry out his ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murray Anderson , costumes by Raoul Pene duBois , music by Dana Suesse ( Whistling in the Dark , You Ought to Be in Pictures , My Silent Love , The Night is Young and You 're So Beautiful ) .
