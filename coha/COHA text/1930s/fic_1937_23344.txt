THE HIDDEN FLOWER A STORY BY GRACE ZARING STONE FT I 'd been in the house a week Dona Marta let me have my meals there . She thought the food I got in restaurants was expensive and not good for me , and she said I was apt to spend too much time in the cantinas . She did n't ask me to eat with her . I never saw her eat , but the Indian maid served me on a little table in the corner of the sala . And such food  --  fillets cooked with almonds and tomatoes , hams baked and pressed in caramelized sugar , albondigas stuffed with mint and hard-boiled eggs , guacamole , and rich soups ; even her frijoles came in a little loaf sprinkled with cheese and nata . After my meals Dona Marta would come and talk to me while I had my coffee and ask if the food was good enough for a young man who spent all his days painting in the streets . Dona Marta looked as though she 'd had good food all her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one could hardly make an exact guess  --  and she was very large and handsome with a fine shrewd , rather severe face banded with thick coarse hair that fitted her cheeks so closely it might have been a wig . She had the clearest skin I 've ever seen , brown but with a clear icy pallor , almost greenish , underneath . Her voice was deep , manly with an air of authority , good-humored but inflexible . In her house everything was immaculate , the red tiled floors , the bed linen , the pots hanging in the kitchen . The kitchen was the nicest room in the house:there were patches of old tiles showing on the walls , an old tiled charcoal stove , and all the pots were beautiful . It was always filled with the sugary , caramel odors of Dona Marta 's cookery , for here she superintended the making of those candies that were packed into frail little wooden boxes and sold , so she told me , at a very good profit . She said they were shipped to all parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them long she was already getting a name for herself . Every morning she went to market to buy the fruits for them , followed by two of her maids carrying great baskets . These came back loaded with quinces , guavas , yams , slices of coconut , and even cactus fruit From the expression of her face I knew she had been driving triumphant bargains . Her maids were all very small and brown and wore blackish-blue rebozos . They spoke in such delicate voices they always sounded like a concourse of insects or birds . Dofia Marta said none of them knew much about cookery . It was a lost art in Mexico she said , and then she would begin to describe to me dishes made in her mother 's kitchen in Sinaloa that would make my mouth water , old-fashioned Mexican dishes that took hours , sometimes even days to prepare . Never made now she said . What a pity ! And then in this city the cooking never had amounted to much . She did n't think much of this city . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . As soon as she told me this I realized that almost nothing in it , except in the kitchen , would have been put there by Doha Marta herself . In the sata the white starched curtains at the long windows , the palms on tall stands , the rosewood Victorian furniture , upholstered in red velvet , were all the remains of the former occupant and left there by Dofia Marta as a concession of some sort . Who , for instance , could imagine her hanging the portiere of beads which trembled before the door of my bedroom and was supposed to shield me , when the door was left open , from the formality of the sala ? What intimate part of the house was Dofia Marta 's own , I never saw and could n't imagine it . When I got up she was always dressed and in her kitchen and no matter how late I got in she was still up and moving about the house . Once or twice I asked people I met in the town about her but no one seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't been there long , but it was easy to see she was a respectable , capable woman , the kind that Mexicans , and all peoples for that matter , admire . The lawyer Ramirez when I once asked him a question about her looked at me very steadily and said that Dofia Marta was a remarkable woman and that I was lucky to have persuaded her to take me in . I agreed with him heartily . He used to come to the house every now and then and he and Dofia Marta would sit in a corner of the sofa on two stiff chairs , talking earnestly in low voices . She had other visitors too , mostly women like herself , middle-aged , in comfortable circumstances , widows perhaps or women who had outgrown the more pressing cares of their families . One or two seemed very poor and these Dofia Marta took out to her kitchen where I suppose she filled them with rice and mole and her good strong chocolate . After a few more weeks Dona Marta and I became even more friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asked me to go to market with her . She criticized my picturesfreely and gave me advice on what to see and do and what periodicals to subscribe to for improving my Spanish . I could see she was a woman who instinctively dominated everyone she came in contact with , but she did it with a great reserve . She never asked me those teasing , intimate questions which women , whether motherly or amorous , usually ca n't resist . Her own life she kept quite separate from mine and it was a vigorous , full life whose sources remained always secret , Sometimes I imagined that her greatest concession of all was taking a young man to board in her house . One day I was walking with her round the market when she stopped to speak to a man and his daughter . The man I 'd seen several times before . He was a Spaniard about sixty or more . I had been told he was the manager of a mine in the neighborhood and was very well off . His name was Don Oscar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot , for he was always on horseback , and even now he wore riding breeches and silver spurs and carried a whip as though he had just got off his horse . He wore a large hat and round his big paunch a stamped leather belt , and his great gray mustachios and beard were brushed out like a Sikh 's . Yes he was really magnificent , with all the masculine dandyism and swagger of an accomplished horseman . The daughter was well dressed too in some thin dark stuff , and I noticed she wore French-looking patent-leather slippers with high heels ; but instead of a hat , a black lace shawl covered her head . She had probably just come from the Cathedral across the plaza . When Dofia Marta presented me she bent her head forward and then turned slightly and her shyness seemed so painful it embarrassed me a little and I looked quickly away from her . Her name was Dofia Azucena . Don Oscar began to talk to us in a harsh voice that was full of badly suppressed anger . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time and that he disliked her enough to be rude to her , perhaps even to do her an injury . He complimented her first very flowerily on her appearance of good health and activity and then said , " 1 see your charm has drawn still another fly into your net . " And when she did not answer he said to me , " I 've seen you , sir , several times about the city . You 're a painter I believe . " " I am , " I said . " You 're fortunate to have this beautiful country at your disposal , " he said . " It should be a painter 's dream , for I notice they always prefer what is most backward and ruinous and lacking in every convenience that man has made for him-self . " I said , " That 's an old-fashioned notion , quite out of date now with painters . Still I see a great deal to paint here quite different from what you suggest . And , " I added , partly to tease him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to paint you . " His vanity could n't resist this . He smiled a little . " I see you have an eye for character , " he said , " perhaps even for the grotesque . But you do n't see me at my best . " He twirled his long mustache . " I have n't always worn this beard , " he said , " you must n't take it seriously . It 's just a caprice of mine . " " I admire it , " I assured him . " So does he , " said Dofia Marta smiling . " But the one you should paint is Azucena here . " As she spoke I knew from the tone of her last words that she regretted it almost instantly and Don Oscar knew it too . He snapped it up . " Yes , " he said , " I must commission you to paint my daughter . I 've been wanting her portrait for a long time . " The girl looked up at Dofia Marta with an expression of pained surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her face was so luminous , even under a thick coat of powder , that it was bluish in all the shadows and the edges were so white they distracted the eye like the edges of a pearl . It was a long oval , perhaps too narrow , but the bones were sensitively and exquisitely modelled . The mouth , unpainted , was hardly visible but the immense dark eyes controlled the face and above her high forehead rolls of black hair lifted her veil like wings . Don Oscar enjoyed my astonishment for I could not at first even speak . " Yes , " he said , looking from me to Dofia Marta . " I must certainly have her portrait . You would n't object to undertaking it I suppose ? " " I 'd be very honored indeed , sir . " " I 'll send you a note , " he said . " Tomorrow probably , for I imagine your time with our delightful friend here is limited . Yes , to-morrow . " He slashed his boots with his whip immensely pleased with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shook my hand and said , " At your disposition sir , " and he and his daughter walked away . I started to question Dofia Marta about him , but her face was severe with such dislike of him and chagrin at having given him an opening to become friendly with me that I quickly refrained Later over my coffee she began to talk of him of her own accord . " He is a Spaniard by birth , " she said , " but he has lived here since he was a young lad , so long that he has taken citizenship papers and for years now he has been a Mexican subject . " " He seems a violent sort of fellow , " I said . " I do n't know why I should think so , but I have the distinct feeling that he would stop at nothing . Is that so ? " " It is . And he is most violent against order and tradition . He is a communist , a member of the P.N.R. ? the Partido National Revolucionario  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agitates most strongly against the Church . He says the Church has been the curse of Mexico and his own country . I have heard of several priests executed at his insistence not long ago , although , " she added honestly , " that may not be true . It was a rumor however at the time . " " Well , lie seems quite a boy , " I said . She looked puzzled at my translation and I returned to more orthodox Span-ish . " How does he manage to be rich , " I asked , " if he 's such a communist ? " She shrugged her broad shoulders . " You must ask him that . He is in favor of dividing the profits of the mine among the workers . Or so he says . But as to politics , who should understand them ? He is a strong man and the strong have it all their own way till the finger of God touches them . " " He has a beautiful daughter . " Dona Marta looked at me somberly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next morning a note was brought from Don Oscar asking me to come that afternoon to paint the portrait of his daughter . I found his house to be a very fine old one but he had made it as modern as he could with modernistic furniture from Mexico City . In one corner of the patio which had an eighteenth-century fountain of bright Puebla tiles , he had installed a large electric refrigerator . I could see no traces of the daughter 's hand about the place . Even the plants in the patio seemed dried and unwatered and long feathery weeds sprouted from the neglected pots . I painted her in the patio on the shady side , and I found it from the very beginning an almost impossible task . In spite of her extraordinary beauty there seemed to be nothing of her to paint . Just as the edges of her delicate face seemed to melt away , so her whole personality was unearthly and uncapturable . If I turned my head away I half expected to find her vanished when I looked back . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you fond of pictures , Senorita ? " I asked . " Yes , " she said , " sometimes . " " What artists do you prefer ? " She hesitated , then said vaguely , " But I do n't remember . " " Do you ride , Senorita ? " " I used to ride , " she said . " Not now . " " Have you been to the United States ? " " No . " " To Spain ? " " No . " And so it went . An old brown woman in a rebozo sat and watched us and servants from the kitchen end of the patio came and peered now and then at the canvas . Don Oscar came in and out of a sort of office at the entrance to the patio . There was a sign on his door  --  Mina Santa Espiritu Pagos  --  Sdbado 3-6 P.M. He seemed quite satisfied with my work , but I felt that what satisfied him most was my presence in the house . He talked a great deal as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once he brought me a newspaper opened at a certain article . " Read that , " he said , " when you have time . It is very strongly put . An article on the confiscation of church property . Ah , that was the best thing we ever tried to do . But would you believe it , there are still those ready to defend them , the leeches , the bloodsuckers ! Why in the State of Vera Cruz do you know how many priests there are ? One to each two hundred and fifty thousand . And here in this town how many ? Five ? imagine it , five . For a wedding their bottom price is ten pesos , for a christening two fifty . Ah , they still line their nests well in spite of us . But read this , " he repeated , " it will show you what we 've been able to do . There are thousands of them in exile now , priests and nuns too , and their property distributed where it will do most good . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , telling me again how pungently , how strongly written it was . " You must hear other points of view , " he said , " than those of a bigoted old woman . " " If you mean Dona Marta , " I said , " we do n't talk of religion . " " Perhaps not , " he replied , " but the atmosphere created by old women is inimical to free thought . " I struggled on with my picture . " Your daughter is very difficult to paint , " I said despairingly . His voice suddenly echoed my despair . " Yes , she is difficult , she is difficult , " he said . In spite of myself I could n't help liking the old fellow . I was to come next day . As soon as I had left the house I wanted to go right back and begin again . I felt all the exasperation of unsuccessful work , but more than that . Once away from the girl , her image , that had been so vaporous , took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt I could easily complete the portrait in a few strokes . And yet I did not , when the image at last became clear , feel I possessed it fully and finally . On the contrary its sharp lucidity I knew was transitory , was the sort of vision that would at any moment elude me again . By the time I reached Dafia Marta 's house it had eluded me and I was consumed by a restless , desperate thirst to recapture it . Every other desire seemed to me wiped from my imagination . Dofia Marta met me coming in . " Well how did it go ? " she asked . She gave me a hard , questioning look . " Badly , very badly , " I said . I thought this answer satisfied her . That night I scarcely slept and the next day before it was time to go to Don Oscar 's house I sat drinking my coffee in the sala . Dofia Marta for the first time did not join me . From the kitchen came the rich , sugary odor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the door . " Excuse my absence , " she said . " I have a large consignment of candy which has been ordered . I must get it ready on short notice and I am very busy . " This time it went as badly as before . I tried to talk to Azucena with as little success , and Don Oscar walked in and out , prodding me with questions about myself , where I lived , who my family were , what I did with my life . I answered him , aware that they were almost the questions put to an aspiring suitor or to a possible one who is already looked on with some consideration by the family . But I did not resent it  --  unless it were for the sake of Azucena , who listened with remote distaste . Her whole personality drew farther and farther from me . It seemed that we both , her father and I , in some manner hopelessly pursued her . That evening Doiia Marta met me coming in . " How 's the candy ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered briskly . Her face was flushed . I could tell she had been over the stove most of the day . " I count myself fifty pesos to the good , " she said . " Congratulations . " " And you , " she asked , " how did it go to-day ? " " Badly again . It seems I ca n't paint her . " She looked so smug I felt suddenly angry . " I do n't know why you ca n't , " she said affably . " You 're a very able painter I should say , though of course I 'm no judge . " " I know why , " I said ; " for two reasons . First , she 's beautiful , and beauty of all sorts has been painted to death . And besides that , I think I 've fallen in love with her . " In her clear brown skin the icy undertone suddenly showed through . The blood had rushed from her face . " That 's not true , " she cried . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " Why not ? Why should n't it be true ? " " She 's not for you , " she said . Her dominating sureness made me insolent . " Maybe she is , " I said . " How should you know ? " She turned and went out . After that we never spoke of her . Data Marta joined me at coffee as before and was kind to me as before . Sometimes I went to market with her but she never spoke of Azucena or Don Oscar or the portrait . I went about the town in the mornings and tried to paint other things . But I only lived until afternoon when I sat with Azucena in the patio . Even Don Oscar knew the portrait was bad , but he was always encouraging me . " Go on , " he said , " it begins to look Iike her round the eyes . " He left me alone with her now and the old brown mummy of a nurse disappeared . I could have said anything I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had every opportunity but I could n't say a word . When we were alone I painted furiously in silence . What should I say ? " Do you like dancing ? Are you fond of flowers ? " And hear her foolish answers . No that had nothing to do with us . None of that was between us . And what was between us ? It seemed to me that it could only be expressed in some mysterious manner , some new unheard-of word , some gesture never before attempted by man . At times when I left the house my sense of having left a special world was so intense that I would walk for blocks without knowing where I was until I found myself suddenly in some strange quarter far from Dona Marta 's house . This went on for over a week . Don Oscar was n't displeased that the portrait went no faster . He kept telling me to take my time . " We have the summer before us , " he would exclaim almost jovially . He invited me into his office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sitting behind his desk , he poured two glasses of Habanero and then he took out a little pink celluloid comb and combed his beard with two or three agitated strokes . " In the matter of progress , " he said , " the human race is discouraging , but I suppose that is to be expected . What we say in effect to a man is this , ' Take this new idea , take this stick of dynamite , it will explode , it will tear you to pieces , but in the end it will do you good . ' That is , of course , hard for him to believe , eh ? And as for the women . . . " He put the little comb away in his vest pocket . " For women ! Try to make them believe that destruction is the life force of the human race . " He went on talking of politics in Mexico and then came back abruptly to the subject of women . " I would as soon explain life to my horse Palomino as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For women there is no explaining . It must be lived , that is all they can understand . And it is for us to see they live . " I agreed and we had another copita . As I left he put his arm for a moment affectionately across my shoulders . It was the day after this that I went to the Cathedral early in the morning . I had n't been able to sleep . It was a fiesta day , and bands and fireworks and church bells had begun long before daybreak . I got up about six-thirty and walked down the cool streets , streaming with white-clad Indians . I followed them unconsciously toward the plaza where they were opening their little booths and stalls and setting out their mats on the cobbles . I walked about for awhile , looking at their pots and baskets , their bright cottons and brighter fruits and vegetables and then , seeing a few people go in the Cathedral , I went in myself . It was very dusky there . Before a haze of candles at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wandered around , looking up at the dense jungles of the gold Baroque altars , examining some pictures by Cabral . A confessional with a very charming scroll design along the top took my eye . The confessionals are now required to be open so that anyone may see the priest and the penitent . I had no wish to take advantage of this by staring , but suddenly I saw the penitent was Azucena . I walked quickly by but sat down on a bench where I could still see her back . The whiteness of her neck in the dark church disturbed me terribly . I could see it gleaming between her black hair and her black dress . Her neck drooped forward like a woman who has fainted . The murmur of her voice and the priest 's just reached me , and I knew at once that the sick thumping of my heart was jealousy . What was she saying to that priest that she could never say to me ? What had she done that I should never know ? Why should there be some communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she passed me , her eyes down , and I do n't believe she saw me . I followed her as far as the front door where I stood in the portico and watched her cross the plaza . It was still so early that only Indians and a few household servants were about . She threaded her way quickly among the crouching Indians , and her feet seemed to have a strange lightness as though they carried her toward a happiness she could scarcely wait for . I could n't endure this swiftness , this apparent joy that took her still farther from me . I was about to run across the plaza after her when just at the little blue band kiosk she suddenly stopped . A woman who had been waiting there on a bench , in the shadow of the trees , got up and held out both hands to her . They looked at each other a moment and then quickly embraced , so quickly that before I realized it they were walking away decorously side by side . The woman was Dona Marta . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my morning coffee , picking at my roll of sweet bread . " Is Doila Marta here ? " I asked the little Indian maid . " Horita " ( immediately ) , she told me . And before I had finished Dona Marta came in . She was fresh and handsome and full of life . As she walked across the room toward me her step too was swift and light and carried her not toward me but toward some unknown delight . " It is Sunday , " she told me , " and also it is a fiesta . The poor souls will he permitted to celebrate . The bishop has come from Mexico to say a high mass and in the afternoon there will be castillos in the plaza . You have never seen a castitle ? You will enjoy it . " She smiled at me benignly and I hated her . Her house was horrible to me and the secret she filled it with , had filled it with all along , was poisonous and fateful . She saw I hated her and her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Will you be here much longer ? " she asked . " Why do you ask ? " I said . " Do you want to get rid of me ? " " No , no , " she answered , " but I have a feeling you are not happy here . " " I 'm not happy . Anyone can see that . But unless you send me away , I 'm not going . " She looked at me a long time . Then she shook her head gravely . " Do n't go , " she said . " All things will come at theirappointed time . No , stay . " And she suddenly laid her hand gently on my shoulder . For a moment my hatred of her lifted and I could almost have leaned against her strong arm . " Will you come on an errand with me ? " she asked . " Yes , " I said , and I got up and went out with her . She gave me her basket to carry . It held some of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ramirez children , " she said . " It 's the feast day of the eldest . " By this time the plaza was crowded with people . The band in the kiosk was tuning up . We could scarcely , with many con permisos , elbow our way through . I went ahead to make way for her . At the edge of the curb the crowd suddenly scattered and Don Oscar rode by on his horse Palomino , a gray , spotted Arab-looking creature , round-barreled , high-crested , with a strong sprouting tail . He saw me and reined back suddenly . The horse reared , pranced delicately backward . The crowd murmured its admiration . Yes , he was magnificent . Old , with his grotesque fan of beard , his paunch reaching to the high pommel , he still managed to be elegant , masculine , violent . " Aha , " he called down to me . " I have just sent a note to you . No portrait today , as a covey of relatives has come to town . Do us the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little celebration . At nine-thirty . " He was in the best of good humor , but suddenly his face darkened . He had seen Dofia Marta just behind me . He held his horse dancing there before us , looking us both over , appraising us . Then he leaned down to look in the basket I carried and picked up one of the frail little wooden boxes . He cracked it with a finger and thumb , examined it , and then cleaned it suddenly with his tongue . He threw the box aside and sucked in his lips violently . " H 'm , " he said . " H 'm , not bad really . I 've never sampled your candies before , Dona Marta . As a matter of fact it has a reminiscent taste . It is like a certain sweet I used to get from Celaya , from a convent there . Those nuns we drove out , but when I taste this it almost seems a pity . " And to me he said , " The nuns of Celaya were famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stood smiling quietly , though I thought she must have known that in comparing her candy to that made by nuns he gave her one of the greatest insults in his power . With a flourish of his great hat he rode off , and we went on our way to the house of the lawyer Ramirez and delivered the candy to the oldest child . That afternoon her house was very stilt in the midst of the noise of the fiesta . Where Dotia Marta had gone I did n't know , but as I could n't paint , I lay on the bed in my room and listened to the bands playing in the distance , to rockets tearing the air like a great rent of silk , to church bells breaking into sudden clangors . In the silences between , flies buzzed in the still air of my room . The plate beside my bed was heaped with cigarette ends . I lay for a long time in a state between sleep and waking , almost between life and death , with only one thought in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman tries to put between us , to-night I'lI see her again . And then I must have slept out of very exhaustion at the barriers that lay ahead , for I knew in some way that what Dona Marta had opposed to me was very nearly insuperable . I must have slept heavily because even when I heard my door opening gently I could n't make the effort to open my eyes . For a moment I had forgotten everything , where I was and all that had happened ; for a blessed , white moment 1 returned to my former innocence and I knew neither Doiia Marta nor Azucena . Then I opened my eyes and the room was sunk in late afternoon twilight . My hat with the red cord hung on the wall , my stacks of canvas were in the corner , I had flung my coat across a chair . The room was empty but the portiere before the door still trembled slightly frorn the hand that had touched it . Then consciousness came back like a slow , growing pain . I heard voices very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the rainlike curtain of beads the two women sitting in the sala on a rosewood sofa . Their heads were close and their voices low . It seemed to me that Azucena 's hands were clasped in Dona Marta 's lap . I watched them for a time , hearing their voices but catching no word . Then I saw Dona Marta lift her head and look past Azucena toward my door and her voice grew much louder . Unconsciously Azucena also spoke more loudly , and I began to understand what they said ; as whoever had opened my door had meant I should . Yes , I could see Dona Marta stealthily opening it , then seeing me asleep , making just enough noise to wake me , just enough so that I should hear what she wanted me to hear . And what she wanted me to hear would be horrible to me . They talked , as I had perhaps known they would , of love . But it was Azucena who talked and Dona Marta who listened . Her voice was quite strange to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lover . " I have no words to tell you , " she said . " Because it is another life , and my understanding is a stranger to it . All of the body of this life seems blind , deaf , and my soul suspended , outside of it . " " Yes , yes , " said Dona Marta , " and to me sometimes too it comes like this . " " Then there is a light , slow at first but gradually stronger , greater . It inundates this poor soul , drowns it , so that this soul blooms first like a bud , then like a flower . Ah , I can say no more . Perhaps it is only pride . Can it be pride ? . . . " Her words showered like fiery sparks in the dusk . I thought my heart would burst with sudden agony . " Last night , " she said , " I think my body was lifted from the ground and I fell into a sort of faint from joy . I thought : so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , out of this husk , this shell . So will it bloom in its true life , the life of spirit and of love . Ah , tell me is this true ? Is it not pride ? Sent by Satan to try me . Ah , no that ca n't be true . It is from Him I know . Tell me it is from Him . " " Be sure it is from Him , " said Dona Marta . And then I knew the love they talked of was the love of God . I lay then in a sort of dream , a mystery , while I saw Dona Marta get up and light two long wax candles in the dim room . I saw her come back and sit down again in the light . She wore a long black robe and a cord round her waist ; on her head hung a black veil , and from her neck a silver cross . Azucenaslipped to the float before her and leaned her head on her knee . Dona Marta put her hand gently on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight , " she said . " All you have told me you must tell him . Then before us two you may pronounce your vows . My be-loved child . " I lay there hearing nothing more . And presently they got up and went into another room . When they were gone I repeated aloud Don Oscar 's words , his foolish , helpless words : The nuns of Celaya were famous for their sweets .
