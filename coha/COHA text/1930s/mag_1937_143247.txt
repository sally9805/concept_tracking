Seven years ago , when Mexican artist Miguel Covarrubias first visited Bali , that East Indies island had not become a stopping-place on round-the-world tours , or the subject of travel films notable primarily for their pictures of " brown girls with beautiful breasts . " Separated from Java by a deep , narrow strait , conquered by the Dutch only 22 years before , Bali was a populous , rainy , mountainous island with no good harbor , hard to get to , hard to get at . By the time Covarrubias made his second visit ( 1933 ) , Balinese dancers had been the sensation of the Colonial Exhibition in Paris and the tourist rush was on . Women had taken to wearing " clumsy blouses , " Dutch gold currency had gone up , prices had fallen and Artist Covarrubias was distressed to find hard times even in this paradise . <P> Last week he published a big , 417-page book , * illustrated by his own sketches and his wife 's photographs , that did Bali up brown . Because he believes that Balinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informative chapters on language , magic , community organization , native legends . Most animated parts of his book deal with the primitive agricultural communism of Bali , with the bewildering luxuriance of art in a land where almost everybody is an artist . Land in Bali is owned by the villages , under terms of " the wisest law ever passed by the Dutch Government , " can not be sold to foreigners , and is leased , the natives believe , directly from the gods . Although there is poverty in Bali when the price of rice falls , and rigid caste divisions ( natives must learn two languages , so a nobleman can address a commoner in lower-class language while the commoner replies vice versa ) , ownership of property has little to do with it . Villages are governed by an organization to which every married man , which means every adult male , belongs ; work is apportioned by a council and slackers are taken care of by the simple device of being declared " dead , " which means they are expelled from the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , joke-loving people , the Balinese have no jails , police their villages in fashion reminiscent of volunteer fire departments in small U. S. towns where putting out fires is a less important function than the holding of dances and feasts . For minor offenses against the village , such as the rare cases of theft , the wrongdoer is punished by being paraded through town , while natives beat drums , shout hilariously , act as if nothing so ridiculous had ever been known before . But when natives go amuck , commit murder , threaten violence , the alarm bell rings as it does for a fire , and the whole community turns out to kill the criminal as it does to extinguish flames . Ceremonial " kidnappings " feature many weddings . The extremely modest Balinese make an official open secret of these elopements . Bride and groom set an hour for the kidnapping . The bride pretends to struggle pitifully . Her relatives pretend to try to save her . Onlookers pretend nothing is happening .
