The Battle ( Lon Garganoff ) tells the story of a Japanese naval commander 's burning devotion to his country . Adapted from Claude Farrre 's novel La Bataitte , the tale involves a " neutral " British observer who has the run of a Japanese flagship , the Japanese commander 's unhesitating use of his dutiful wife to get naval secrets his country needs , his final expiation of this dishonor . Aside from the extravagances of the plot , the pictorial treatment of The Battle is nearly perfect . <P> Far more important than the commander 's personal tragedy are the remarkable battle sequences in the last reel , an international patchwork of action shots enterprisingly assembled and cleverly welded . Russian-born Lon Garganoff and some of his fellow migrs in Paris started an unpretentious photographic laboratory called Socit Anonyme Lianofilm , made enough profit to try a picture . Garganoff sent Nicholas Farkas , his crack cameraman , to Japan . Farkas made a close study of aristocratic Japanese interiors , got shots of harbors cluttered with boats , of Japanese street crowds . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confiscated by the Japanese authorities . Upon Farkas ' return to Paris , Garganoff borrowed a French warship , made action sequences in her gun turrets , on her decks , on her bridge , with Japanese actors impersonating Japanese sailors . To piece out the action U. S. newsreel shots of battle maneuvers , gunfire and torpedo practice were purchased from Fox . <P> As a final touch the Italian film of the St. Stephan 's sinking ( also to be seen currently in The First World War ) was obtained . On June 11 , 1918 , the St. Stephan , flagship of the Austrian Navy , was attacked in the Adriatic by Italian torpedo boats . A torpedo found its mark and the St. Stephan began to list and sink with terrible rapidity . Frantic Austrian sailors are to be seen clambering up her steep deck and over onto her almost horizontal side . At that point the ship quivers convulsively , shakes many of them off into the water . Others manage to stay on the St. Stephan 's upside-down hull as she turns completely over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swirl of water . <P> Good shots in The Battle 's battle : white uniforms on the bridge flapping against a grey sky in what seems to be a mingled whine of wind and speeding turbines ; the commander getting the enemy 's range again &; again in his finder , announcing it in a flat singsong ; one gun turret after another reporting " Ready " ; a lone survivor in one gun turret groping to the telephone for instructions ; sailors , protected by masks and helmets , staggering about in fume-filled turrets , loading the guns ( see cut , p. 44 ) . The battle is bitter and bloody . When it is over and victory has been won , the commander retires to his quarters , dons the ceremonial robes for harakiri , slices his belly open . Another officer administers the coup de grce with a full two-handed sword stroke . <P> - ? -
