searching for the channel underneath her shoulders ; and the slow settling down of blankets , like soft hands , on her breast , her knees , her thighs , her ankles , round her neck , until she was completely wrapped and his face came into the hollow on her shoulder . Outside , the frost was settling on the shingle roof ; in the marsh the powdery afternoon snow was fluffed with crystals and the feet of moving shrews made ladder tracks . The new moon was going down , and from it , on their velvet cloth , the facets of the stars caught pricks of light . The strange green northern lights would breathe . Jerry said , " Do you like Hunter ? " She heard her body saying , " Yes . He ' s got an honest face . " But her heart was dwelling deep inside of her , and her real hearing was turned inward . " It would be better , beginning in a new town , Mary . A man like me would go much farther , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It seems more likely . " " Maybe . " " Mary , you seem a more unspoken girl all the more I see you . Do you love me ? " " Yes . " " Really ? " " Yes , Jerry . " " Sometimes , lately , it seems there ' s something on your mind . Is there something ? " " Something , Jerry ? " Now the stillness . " What is it , Mary ? " " Yes . I ' 11 tell you , soon . " " You are n't unhappy ? " " No . " She wondered why he could n't see , or feel ? There must be difference for a hand to trace , she felt so changed . He leaned on his elbow to kiss her . His face lingered . She felt his breath steal down her face and throat and rest upon her breast . P20I " Sometimes when I kiss you , Mary , your mouth tastes of milk . That 's a queer thing , is n't it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Mary felt herself sink down in humbleness , and then her body surged and filled and her hands and her breasts and her legs were charged with life . She held her breath . But he was saying , " Lewis is setting the cap tier to-morrow . One side ' s done and I have got the gates built . Caleb ' s bringing up the casted waste-gates in the morning . " She felt his breathing close against her side . He tried to laugh . " I ' ve got this thing in my head , I guess . I ca n't get it out . If I could n't come down here to you , every week , I do n't know what would come of me . " She said nothing . " You remind me of different things . Of late , I keep remembering the barley field where we got wedded . Do you mind , he was ploughing it for barley ? And that little boy fetching us trout ? Some way , the minister looked troubled to me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning the work seems smaller to me . Lifting is an easy thing . And the westward end do n't seem so great a way to reach . " His hands were trembling . Her outside self became aware of his quest and she knew that she was empowered to fulfill it . But her being was still inward . This was the darkness ; and she could not bear to lift it . The rattle of wheels woke the farmhouse early the next morning . Jerry slid out of bed . The loft had the chill night smell of a sleeping house . Beyond the sash , Mary saw a faint greyness beginning in the east . Jerry stood still , listening to the sharp slap of the horse 's hoofs . " That ' s Bourbon , " he said suddenly . " Caleb ' s come with the castings. "  |p202He  reached for his clothes . " You stay abed , Mary . He ' 11 want to get right out to the lock . Now he ' s got up here at last , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have used them castings six days back . " As he threw his shirt over his head , the wagon rattled into the yard and stopped . There was a complete silence . Then they heard the wheels squeaking slightly as the wagon jerked to the deep breathing of the horse . " He ' s wondering if I ' m here , " said Jerry . Downstairs Dorothy was getting up . At the first sound of her boots across the puncheons a mighty knocking shook the door . Dorothy crossed to the window . Laughter shook her voice . " Just a minute , Mr. Hammil , while I decent myself a little . Robert ' s out . " " Is Jerry Fowler inside there ? " bawled the contractor 's voice . " Yes . He ' s getting up . " " Tell him to hurry up . Slug-a-bedding this way , and a whole lock to be completed ! It 's terrible cold out here , Mrs. Melville . Ca n't you let me in ? I wo n't look nowhere . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hike on a petticoat . " She opened the door . " There , come in . You do look cold . I 'll boil you up some tea . " " Ca n't wait , thank you . " He blew out a tremendous breath . " That cold has got me breathing like a bellows , Mrs. Melville . Just point me at your fire and I ' ll have it blazing up in no time . " " I ' 11 do it . " " Jerry up ? " " Yes . I hear him moving . " Caleb sat down before the hearth and raked open the bedded coals . Mrs. Melville dropped a stick upon them . " By daggit ! When a man like me gets cold there ' s a lot of him to feel it . " Jerry came back to the bed . " I 'm going . He ' s left Bourbon unblanketed out there . Whyp 203 do n't you come out to the lock this afternoon if it grows warmer ? You 've not seen it now in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She was glad to be left . She felt miserable again this morning . The cold grey dawns seemed always clutching at her . She lay still , heard Caleb 's greeting , boisterous , full of simulated anger , the door closing in the face of Dorothy 's protests , Caleb saying , in what he took to be a whisper , " Well , if I was you , and you was me , you ' d have to wait a danged sight longer , boy . " Inside Dorothy chuckled . " The old he-sheep ! He considers that he ' s lusty . " The wagon sped away . When she went down a little later , Mary met Hunter coming from the barn . His hands and face were ruddy from the icy washing , his leather clothes smelled strong of hay . " Good morning , Mrs. Fowler . " " Good morning , Mr. Hunter . It ' s a cold morning . " " It ' s snappy . " She saw his knowing eyes upon her face drop swiftly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , and let her go in peace ; but when she came into the kitchen again , his eyes greeted her with half a smile . He did not talk much , but , on leaving , his thanks touched the two women . They watched him striding off beside his chunky horses , his boot heels raising clods from the road . The bells twinkled in the sunlight and the notes were clear . Dorothy said , " He noticed you this morning . He asked me . I told him . " " Oh , " said Mary . " Shucks-a-daisy , dearie . You could n't hide nothing in that line from that man . He ' d notice things a boy like Jerry ' d miss . He must have had his own high times . " " He does n't look like that . " " Why should he ? He ' s an honest man , and he 's handsome.  |p204There  ' s plenty of girls would visit with him by a fence , I reckon . Withouten even asking . Why should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorothy began their morning tasks . The sun shone bright all morning ; all the swamp was glittering white . A few pinched clouds were hanging in the piercing blue of the sky . After noon , Mary said that she was going to walk out to the lock . " Do you feel equal to it , dearie ? " Dorothy 's homely face was bent solicitously . " It ' s cold , you know . And I could go out with you , if you ' re bound to do it . " Mary laughed . " I ' m bound . And I feel fine now . " " Dress warm . " Dorothy superintended dressing . She stuffed a pair of Melville 's boots with swamp grass dried before the fire and pulled on over Mary 's feet an extra pair of woolen socks . She had forced her to dress in one of Jerry 's heaviest red suits of underwear , both of them giggling at the figure Mary made . " Good land ! " cried Dorothy . " You ' re image to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big . It ' s scarcely decent . " Mary laughed . " I expect it will look queer . " But now she was bundled up from the top of her head to her small toes nesting in the grass in Melville 's boots . She had a sheepskin coat over all and a heavy flannel skirt of dark red-brown , and a deepbluewoolen shawl upon her head , pinned close beneath her chin . Her face was pink . The shadows under her eyes brought out their depth of grey . " She ' s going to tell Jerry , " Dorothy said to herself . " It ' s troubling her . " She watched Mary along the road to the beginning of the corduroy . The stuffed boots made her shuffle and the erect figure moved very slowly . Her short shadow , flickering along the ruts , was vivid blue.  |p205Mary  took her time . She thought that if she arrived when they were nearly finished at the lock , Jerry would let her wait and come back with her . The sun had peeled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarred logs bare . Where the snow lingered , she could make out Bourbon 's tracks , blurred by the slight noon thawing . She looked about her as she walked . The cold lacked fierceness and the air was clean to breathe . From time to time she stopped to view her shadow . In half an hour she came into view of the shanty . A thin smoke from the stovepipe vanished just above the roof , as if in the cold air it could no longer live . A few of the men had been living on there of late , and yet the shanty wore a look of utter desolation . Then she saw that no more dish towels hung on the wash-line , and that the kitchen window had been boarded over . That meant one thing : to-night the rest of the men were going to move on down to Number Two , and Jerry would come home with her . Two week-day nights together , she would have him . Suddenly she felt the cold . She shivered , and for an instant she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She could see it now ; there were two walls of grey stone rising side by side . The mason was working at one end of the near wall . Caleb knelt upon the other shouting down directions . She heard Jerry 's voice answering . Then the odd little man , whose name was Cosmo Turbe , bawled loudly for helpers . In a moment half a dozen men were lifting up a great square frame of planks . They had a pulley on a tripod to let it slowly down , and Cosmo 's sleepy helper was gripping the rope in monstrous red chapped hands . Their figures were all tense , their voices brittle with excitement . Mary stayed where she was to watch . Left and right she saw a line cut through the marsh grass , alders rooted up and dragged aside  --  a broad avenue , like the commencement work up on a turnpike . But the red marking stakes stood just where they had been . As far as she could see , the ground lay open , torn and uneven , black with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like a wound from a gigantic ragged knife , and the marsh was white and deathly . But the men 's voices , their red sweaty faces , dripped with life ... . " There , " said Lewis , cutting the mortar cannily along the outside corner of the capstone . " You can dog that gate in now . " His pointed trowel tinkled where he dropped it . He fished in his pockets for tobacco and slowly stuffed a pipeful . " That mortar ' s all set solid . She ' 11 hold frost . I ' d like to have the water cement , but even so them walls will not fall down like Jericho 's . " Jerry , walking the board floor of the pit , moved to the southwest corner . On either side the light-grey walls of stone rose twice his height . The edges fitted true , each stone had settled neatly ; a monument could be no smoother . One of the men shouted . " Here comes Roberts ! There ' s a feller with him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Put that gate in . Heave her up . " He signaled with one hand . " Way up . Easy now . A little more . " The gate shut out the sunlight over Jerry 's head . The end beams rubbed off splinters on the stone . There was a squeak of wood on stone . Then the lower edge tilted down . He put up his hands to guide it . " Lower , easy , " Caleb cried . The iron socket in the base of the hingepost slowly swung to meet the upright quoin point . Suddenly it clanged and the rope in Plute 's red hands went slack . Hammil was on the gate in one squat spring . " Hold her ! " he roared . " I 've got to get that anchor strap screwed on . " He passed a three-inch iron strap over the top of the hinge-post and rammed the threaded ends through the sockets in the tie-straps grouted into the stone wall . His fat fingers twirled the heavy nuts . " Where in hell 's the wrench ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long handle till the nuts bit solid . " Ease off . " Plute sighed and let the rope go . The timbers groaned as the gate settled.  |p207Jerry  stood for a moment in the pit . All four gates were open , and he looked eastward . The mounting courses of stone gave meaning to the floor he had laid in so many days ago . They showed the step down at the head that made the lock 's descent , their wings stretched wide as if they waited for the water . He turned to west . Again there were wings , pointing the full width of the canal , showing the track of the grubbers . It was his work that he had done with his own hands . Sunk in the sprawling marshland , its exactitude was beautiful . He stood quite still , till Caleb cried , " Climb out , Jerry ! Here 's the Chief Engineer . " Jerry climbed the ladder , slowly . Roberts greeted him . Standing beside Roberts was an elderly man , with a wise , strong face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were staring into the lock-well . Jerry saw them noting everything . " Roberts tells me it ' s solid work , Hammil . He ought to know . But I can see from here the work is right . It ' s fine , square work-manship . " Caleb beamed . " It ' s honest , every inch . I can vouch for it . I know the man that built it under me is right . " He gestured . Mr. Wright looked up at Jerry , smiled , held out his hand . " It ' s good work , Fowler . Roberts has told me about you . " He turned back to Caleb . " The commissioners are n't quite so eager to come inspecting at this time of year . But I 'm glad I came . We 've got three completed sections finished west of Rome , but this is the first stone work . The whole canal will rest on the stone and timber work . " Caleb swelled with pride as Mr. Wright added , " I hope it all will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , the men turned away . Caleb was beaming . " Let ' s try the gates ! " Cosmo Turbe yelled and ran across the beams , his nailed heels leaving marks at every step . They manned the gates together , eight men , six wondering how they worked while Caleb explained to them . " She ' s at high level for a boat from Rome . " His stout voice bellowed . " There comes the mules . Stand back , you dumb bezabor . Do you want to get kicked by a hinny mule ? " A tall man ducked aside , so vivid was the sudden picture . Plute guffawed , and clapped his hand upon his mouth . " Whoa ! " shouted Hammil , red cheeks all a-sweat . " Easy on that boat there . Do you want to knock her bow in ? Here she comes . Right in . Sixty feet of her , loaded to draw three feet with Devereux whiskey bound for O-hio . Now we close the upper gates . You work that one , Cosmo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the sluice-leaves in the lower . " They ran in two groups down along the lock walls . Only the mason continuedsitting on his stone . He had laid up walls that would n't come down like Jericho 's . Hammil cranked the sluice-leaf open on his side . " The water ' s running out . You can hear the overflow from east commence upon the tumble bay . The boat ' s going down . See her ! She ' s eight foot , ten foot , lower that she was . There she is at bottom level . Push round that beam , there , Cosmo ! " The lower gates swung open . " Git , you hinny ! Git , you mules ! There she ' s easing out . See her . She ' s bound for Buffalo . Maybe the boater passes me a quart drawed from a keg in fair exchange for water . " With staring eyes the men followed his pointing finger along the black muck track the grubbers left . They saw the marsh , and the shadow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands apart . " By gravy , boys ! We 've finished Number One ! " Jerry looked up , and he became aware of Mary , standing off a little way , the slight wind riffling the edge of her shawl , a still figure against the snow ... . Caleb said , " I ' m closing up this shanty , now . Will you two ride along with me ? " The men had moved on down to Number Two . Lewis had gone with his mule and his helper . The marsh was empty but for the three of them and Bourbon standing at the shanty door . The shadows had drawn out . The evening cold was stealingin.  | " I ' d like to walk , " said Mary . " Thank you , Mr. Hammil . " She looked at Jerry . Jerry nodded . " All right , then . I 'm going back to Utica , Jerry . I 'll deposit for you , shall I ? " , , yes .  --  " All right . I 've sold this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the digging contracts . A good sell . I did n't lose a penny . Jerry , you ' 11 go down to Cossett 's lock and finish up the boarding . Maybe Lewis can lay stone for two weeks more if the frost do n't bear down too heavy . I ' ll come up in two weeks if the roads are passable . " He poked the latchstring in . " Good-bye , you both . " He climbed over the wheel . Bourbon set himself to start . Jerry suddenly broke his silence . " Do n't leave Bourbon stand outside unblanketed . " Caleb looked down . He seemed to estimate the tone . His fat face was set seriously . Then he grinned . " I ' m not a complete fool . " He waved his hand and rattled off . Mary touched Jerry 's arm . " What 's the matter , Jerry ? " " There ' s no matter . " " I thought the way you said that , that you and Caleb might have quarreled . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his toes in the snow . He walked slowly to the lock and took a last look at it . " I ' m glad you wanted to walk . I would n't want to ride with him just now . " Mary was concerned . " But why ? " " Oh , he acts as if he ' d built the lock himself . It ' s funny , Mary . When he hired me and showed me that-there plan , I thought he knew a lot . He do n't . Self knows more than him . It ' s me that did the work . " " But he put up the money . He ' s responsible . " " Just the same , they think he did it . " Mary stole a sidewise glance.  |p2I0  " They know your work . Caleb said so . Mr. Roberts must have said so to Mr. Wright , from what Mr. Wright said . I 'd judge so anyway . " He looked down . " Anyway it ' s good work , Mary . Lewis does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Look how easy they handle . " He swung one of them . " You could do it . Try against it . " Smiling , Mary tried . It was surprising how easily the gate swung . " I built them , " Jerry said . " Just from plans . " His eyes were moody . He did not seem to want to leave his work . After a while , though , Mary said , " I take so long to walk in all these bundlings . Had n't we better start ? " He looked up quickly at her . " Yes . Let ' s go . It ' s cold . " He started out beside her . But as they came to the bend in the corduroy , he turned for a last look at the lock . " Eight weeks we 've been there . Maybe I 'll never take another look at it . But it ' s a good job . " Mary looked at his face , turned in profile . She could see a little muscle quivering behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an affection for a thing of stone that you yourself would never handle . He looked unkempt , but she loved him so . Beyond him , the sun was setting  --  a flat reddish disc , without warmth , giving no color to the sky , but touching the clouds with bronze . The horizon rose no higher than his shoulders , the marshlandlay fiat beneath his hand . Down by Number Two she saw a light gleam in the shanty window . Far away under the sun was Cossett 's tavern . It showed no light , only a line of smoke to northwardof the sun . Everywhere between , the skeleton grass lifted broken leaves . He loomed before her , larger and larger as she saw these things , and the dim , half-felt sorrow that stilled his face also made it beautiful . He let out a steamy breath , and turned to her . " Why , Mary , what ' s the matter ? What are you crying for ? "  |p211She  sniffled up her sob . " It ' s nothing . Jerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She could hardly feel it through the thickness of her wraps , but the weight of it lay on her . " What is it ? I know something ' s been troubling you . " " I want to tell you , but I ca n't . " She tried to laugh . " It ' s funny , ai n't it , Jerry ? " " Tell me what you were thinking of , looking out over there . " " It looked so lonesome , Jerry . " " It does look lonely , " he said . " I never liked it just as land . " He shivered . " I ' d hate to be that lock-tender . " " Esquire Forman plans a town here , Dorothy says . " " A town ? " He laughed , his laughter making clouds . " I do believea lot will happen , but not that . " He stared westward . " A town ' twixt here and Cossett 's ! " His arm tightened round her shoulders . " Mary , it makes me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me this way . It was n't just the lonesomeness that made you cry ? " " I ' m not crying now . " " No . But what was it ? " " Jerry , why do n't we get land now that you 've saved up money ? We 've got enough to start . I 'll work hard . I ' m strong . I 'll make it comfortable . I want to work along with you . " Her voice grew lower ; she spoke hurriedly , her eyes fixed straight ahead . " Now you ' re just bringing me along , just as if I was a fancy  --  " She bit her lip . Jerry 's arm almost fell away . He was examining her with wide eyes . " Why , Mary . What made you think of that ? " His face grew set and his eyes cold . " You know I never thought of no such thing . " " I do n't care . It makes me feel that way . " " Ca n't you forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can . Jerry , I feel just like a satchel property . " " I ' m sorry , " he said quietly . She raised her eyes , and suddenly the tears broke out . " I did n't mean it , Jerry . Honestly . I ' ll go anywhere . I do n't feel so  --  only it seems you are way off from me . Back there in Utica . " " It was just as bad for me , " he said grimly . " Maybe worse . " He thought of Dencey . " Oh , but you were working , doing things . But it do n't matter , and I ' m lucky now to be along and live with Dorothy . She 's been so good . " He kept walking as if he marched , steadily , left , right , left , right , as if there were no corduroy to slip on . " I ' m happy , Jerry , I ' m happy . Honest . You must n't mind what I said . There ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her contrition was as breathless as her burst of discontent . She eyed him as she walked . And seeing him thinking , her eyes suddenlygrew shy . Before he turned she had stopped , but he stepped back swiftly to her , took her shoulders in his hands , and shook her gently . He was grinning . " Tell me just what ' s wrong , Mary . Do n't put it off . " " I ' m going to have a baby , Jerry . " She opened the throat of his coat with her hands and hid her face inside . Her shoulders heaved . She felt him stiffening . " I did n't know , " he said . " I just knew something , but I never thought . " His hands kept fumbling with her shoulders . " How long have you known it , Mary ? " She said , her voice muffled almost to extinction , " Almost a month , now . " " You might have told me sooner . " " I did n't want to tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited . " He patted her . " You were n't scared to tell me ? "  |p213She  could not speak for sobbing , but he felt her face jerk up and down . " For God 's sake , why ? " " It seems as though I ' m just a drag hitched to you . Always costing money . " " We can afford it . I guess there ai n't a better way to spend it . A doctor , I ' ve heard tell , will cost you round about two dollars . We can get a woman in to help you . I would n't care if it was twice as much . Why , Mary , soon I ' 11 be earning more . You ai n't scared for yourself ? " Her sobs were easing . She shook her head . " Not much . A little sometimes . Way out here . " With a bent forefinger he fished for her chin . " Think of it . " He laughed a little . " Three of us . Right here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were stiffening the lashes . He bent his head and kissed her . " It ' s time we hurried . You must n't take a risk of cold . " He held her close to his side . She asked him , " Jerry , would it be all right for me to stay at Dorothy 's to have it ? It seems homey , somehow . " " Surely . Let 's see , when will it ? " He counted . " August , maybe , " said Mary . He counted again . " By then I will be working out in Jordan Lock . I 'll come back when your time is due . You must n't be scared , Mary . " She put her hand in his . They walked silent through the silence . The twilight came in , pale green and wavery . The night rose up in the east , a steely curtain cut for stars . They heard the frost rustling the grass . Jerry kept his glance ahead , and Mary looked up at his face . She traced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his jaw , until her eyes ached . He must be thinking of the lock to build in Jordan , she thought . And then she thought with pride that it would be a fine lock . She felt very proud , now , of his work . Caleb had praised it . Mr. Wright . They spoke to him as to a man of equal station . It made her humble to feel proud , and she did not mind his thinking of his work . But when she asked him what he thought about he answered promptly . " I was just revolving names . I 'd thought of Richard for a name . Or Francis . I like Francis , do n't you , Mary ? " She lifted her face . A mischievous quirk bent her lips . " Yes , but suppose it is a girl . " " I never thought ! " He felt something inside his arm that made him pause . They were just on the verge of the farm . They saw the lighted window and Dorothy 's face anxiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to me you ' ve said a lot . " " As if they minded cold " WHEN the winter came at last , it settled an icy grip upon the farm . Christmas Eve began with thawing ; the roofs dripped rhythmically all the morning ; but as the day wore on , the dripping slowed . When Melville went out at dusk to measure the icicles hanging from the kitchen eaves , he found one four feet long . " Four feet of snow , " he reported . " It do n't seem possible . " " Four feet deep upon the ground ? " Mary was incredulous . The end of Melville 's long nose bent humorously . " I guess the snow do n't fall like that in England . " " No , " she said , and Jerry remembered a winter when the snow was six feet deep in Uniontown and the ground-floor windows had upslantingtunnels dug down to them to bring in light . Then Melville told tall stories of the drifts . A minister had been entrapped in Pompey meetinghouse one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dig in to him , or he dig out . They found him frozen stiff next spring ,  --  it was so cold ,  --  but he had preachedp215a sermon for them . The whole sermon was frozen stiff . They brought the words out one by one into the warm air and listened to them thawing . A fearful tale . Only the deacon was an unread man , and mixed the words . " Shush , shush , you Robert , " Dorothy said . " Such tales before a girl ! " He looked embarrassed , with a sidelong glance at Mary . Jerry hushed . Mary smiled at her spinning . She knew that time was showing in her , but it was comforting to be so guarded . One week later the snow began in earnest . The sun had lost itself at noon , and all the day long the wind veered slowly through the north to eastward . At sunset time , without a warning , it snapped back again to west and the snow started . After dark she listened to it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady drone like hiving bees ; and the cold stole into the house and the log walls shrank and groaned . When morningcame , a stillness hushed the world . Melville 's stockinged feet thumped loud as guns when he got up and opened up the door . " She ' s snowed all right , " she heard him telling Dorothy . " My Lord ! I 'll bet two feet has fallen . " His voice was loud , as if he took pride in this elemental demonstration . " Dry snow , " he said . " It ' s drifting powerful . " " You ' 11 have to dig us out a passage to the barn , " said Dorothy . " Mary had n't ought to flounder out in snowshoes . Early-morning sweats are bad at her time . " Jerry woke up with a startling catch of breath , and sprang from bed . " It ' s surely snowed for fair . " He looked round the loft . " Funny , " he said , " how snow will creep in places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gather a handful from the floor . His face was bright . Laughing again , he showed it to her in his fist.  |p216Suddenly  he jerked his nightshirt off and rubbed himself all over till his skin was red . He kept on laughing through his chattering teeth . Melville bawled up through the opening . " No more carpenteering now for you , Jerry , for a spell . " " It do n't look so . " " Even hauling wo n't be possible for a piece . " " I ' ve got my flooring ready hauled for Number Two , " said Jerry . " That ' s all I care about . " That day they did not even attempt to break the roads . They kept a trench shoveled to the barn and spent their time in splitting wood . Mary watched them through the window , red-faced , their clothes all fresh with color against the sky and snow , their axes rising and swooping , their voices talking between the stroke-sounds . At dusk the snow began again . That evening she started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stored somewhere . The two women discussed the pattern . Neither knew a design for so small a spread and so they made it up . A star set in the middle with little stars for borders , red and white . Dorothy had dyed the red . She made the tint in peachwood-brew . From time to time the men would walk across and look on , making knowing suggestions . Mary and Dorothy would accept these silently and then go on with their own plans . Every day , no matter how bright the morning was , it seemed to Mary that the snow began again at dusk . At first it fascinated her , the endless gentle downward drift of flakes , or the wild skirling westward winds that smothered everything with the very excess of their breath and fired icy flakes like birdshot from the racing clouds . There was a comfort in feeling herself shut in , herself and Dorothy completing the household duties early and spending their long hours inventing new flavors for their simple food or indulging in their fill of spinning , weaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barn was warm and cosy , the air invigorating with ammonia . The heifer calved and made a fussp217about her calf , and they had a week of fun in teaching the awkward thing to dip its muzzle in a pail . There was excitement , too , in seeing Melville take the ox-sled out to break the roads , the white curving horns dimly shining through the flakes as the oxen bent their necks and buffeted the drift with crooked knees . He had a contract to keep the road open ; for one contractor was still digging in the marsh . It had been found that in the wettest stretch the men made better progress when the muck was frozen  --  even though they had to shovel out the snow each morning . Their food was brought in once a week on three horse-sleds . Each sled could carry little , for the perishables had to be wadded thick with straw . Dorothy would look out when she heard jingling of bells along the Orville road . Her homely face worked . " From December into March , me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selves , and now they come past close to every week . " Strange faces had no interest for Mary . Jerry was off again , now that the crust was formed , buying and hauling timber to the other lock-sites . She liked to sit at her sewing or weaving , close to the hearth , watching the big day-log disintegrate and calling Dorothy when the time had come to pry another foot of it into the coals . She could see the flakes through the window , drifting down , and her eyes traced patterns in their fall that brought strange meanings to her . Icicles sprouted on the eaves and broke away according to the fluctuationsof the weather . One still clear night it got so cold that Mary woke half numb . It seemed to her for a long time that only the child inside of her kept her alive . She thought she could feel it taking on the forms of life , breathing , turning over to rest its side from its long dormance . The cold was all in her legs and arms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew she should get up and find additional warmth , and she tried to steel herself to movement . But her muscles remained unwilled . She thought , " I ' 11 die , surely . " Downstairs it was as still as death . The Melvilles had each other for their warmth . She wondered where Jerry might be , where he was that minute , if he thought of her or if he slept . Her thoughts swam into one another , confusing her , and she only knew she was cold . Outside the cabin the brittle whisper of the snow put life into the stillness . It had a sinister low note . Without looking at the window , she knew that there was moonlight . Then a queer , sharp , living voice came to her ears . At first she thought a dog was barking , but it was querulous , half human . The sound of it frightened her , and she had a sense at once of the snow pushing against her , smothering her like a blanket so large that she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of snow . She lay still , shivering . Next morning , she described it to Melville . " Foxes , " he said . " It ' s been a poor season for small animals . They must be in the marshes hunting mice . " Dorothy nodded . " I heard them last night , too . As if they minded cold . " " We used to hear wolves sometimes when we first came here , " said Melville , pouring cream into the churn  --  they planned on butter for a treat . " I knowed they could n't harm us , but I was always fearful when I heard them . They would come down over the lake , perhaps from Canady . A pack . You ' d hear them miles away and heading for you . Then they would go by some place far off . " " I saw one once , " said Dorothy . " A fearsome sight . It used to be easy to have children in on time for dark . They were afraid of wolves . But now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minded . Wolves do n't ' fraid them any more . " Mary shivered . Foxes , she said , were bad enough for her . " You would n't have minded , " Dorothy said . " Only that baby in you frightened you . " " I was so cold . But after I had heard them he moved once . Real hard . I was n't feared of them then . I got up and put on socks and a shirt of Jerry 's . I was real warm after . "  |p219But  the cabin had grown smaller since that night . She began to move with a sense of care , deliberately measuring off the little spaces between the hearth and the table , the table and the dresser , the wheels and the side of the Melvilles ' bed . Outside , the barn seemed farther from the house and the snow walls to the path much higher ; but , oddly , the sky had limited the land  --  the world looked small . Yet in the evening Mary would listen to the singing kettle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the steady beat of the dasher in the churn , and the sight of Dorothy 's strong , manlike hands would comfort her . Then she would sing softly , conscious of the harmony these things made with her own feeling . " Shining Dagger " pleased her . She would hum it at first , but gradually the words would steal into the antique melody :  --  " It is no use to ask my mother ; She too intends to set us free . So go , my dear , and court some other , And I no more will trouble thee . " The walls seemed to stand more sturdily against the snow . The fire would burn more evenly . The kettle would lull its note more hollowly in its round belly . " Oh , I can climb the tallest tree , love , And I can reach the highest nest , And I can pluck the sweetest rose , love , But not the heart that I love best . " Jerry would seem not so far away ; and the winter a shorter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brighter with the candlelight . Sometimes , shyly , Melville would ask her for some other tune . He liked the old tunes , and it pleased Mary to be asked . It reminded her of her girlhood , when she sang for her mother . She would smile at him and Dorothy ; their homely faces became kind in her eyes . Perhaps she would sing them " Daily Growing " or " Warranty Deed , " or a newer song , like . " Highland Mary , " or one of Tomp220Moore 's , or a little thing she had once heard and remembered for its tune :  --  " Love , lady , love ! There ' s always joy in loving , But sigh not when you find That man is fond of roving . For when the summer beeTakes wing through beauty 's bower , He knows not which to choose Among the many flowers . " March changed . There was a thaw , when all the snow seemed sinking on the marsh and the taller heads of grass showed their broken backs . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cabin shook to its pummeling . At dusk the barn would be full of chaff-dust and the lantern flame would quiver . The beasts stirred uneasily . Their eyes kept swinging . Now and then the heifer would lift her muzzle and bawl , and the sound of her voice would be deafening in the narrow space . Mary felt her head swim , and her knees quiver on the overburdened pail . The days grew longer . They ate supper before twilight ; but the snow lay as heavily against the walls , the top fresh as before from the night 's down-drifting ; and the rotting that was going on underneathit was concealed . Mary felt a desperation growing in her . They had not heard from Jerry for two months . At times , at night , she was afraid . She would begin to wonder whom he might be staying with . She made pictures of him to herself meeting imaginary girls . The fitfulness of the wind would shake her , and while she slept she dreamed . But little by little , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the snow went each day , she grew more aware of the possession of her that the child was taking . She united little events with their significance to herself . Spring , she felt , would not stir her as it was beginning already to stir the Melvilles ; for time became centred in her consciousness with the end of summer . " SOME MEN WORK HARD " 22I " Some men work hard ; they have n't understanding " BuT the spring came with a suddenness that captured Mary after all . One dawn she woke with a sense of freshness in the loft . There was no sound of wind , but the wind was blowing . She could feel it on her face , a warm draft from the window ; the curtains were lifting gently ; and on the roof was a sound she had forgotten . Steady , gentle , it seemed to draw her being out . She felt herself relaxing on the bed , as if her brain let go one by one of all her nerves , and they were soothed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The snow had turned to rain ... . All the world was enveloped in the greyness  --  no sunset showed , and there would be no moon , no stars . She was alone . Behind her in the black gulf of the barn door she heard one of the oxen snuffle softly . Then her senses jerked ... . He was coming from Onondaga way . She had recognized his step the moment she heard it . She strained her eyes against the misty darkness . The feet sludged towards her steadily . Sometimesthe sound was faint , then it came loud and close and she made her voice ready ; and then again it faded out , almost to nothing . And suddenly , when she was sure she had a minute yet to wait , she saw a swirl in the darkness and his figure standing there while he peered for the cabin lights . " Jerry . " She could make out the turning of his head . " Jerry , " she called . " Mary ! " He had discovered her . Her heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came close . She smelled him now , hot , his clothes steaming . He put his arms round her and bent down to kiss her . His face , like hers , was wet with mist.  | " How did you know I was coming ? " " I heard you back by the barn . " " How are you , Mary ? " " Fine . " Her hands felt of his hard body through the wet clothes . " I ' m glad to come back . It did n't seem that spring would ever come . " " You ' re soaking wet . " He laughed . " I doubt if you could get a horse through from Onondaga . But when I got there before noon I could n't stop . " He took her arm and together they threshed back to the kitchen door and Jerry lifted Mary 's pail . " Hello , there , " he said . " I 've just come in from milking . " " Well , by dog ! " Melville jumped up from his sprouting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rain sluiced over the roof . They talked and talked . They made Jerry tell them every last small thing that he had seen . " I bought and hauled in timber for four locks ... . " They ' re ready waiting now at Geddes , and Camillus , and Jordan , and Port Byron ... . " Caleb will buy for Montezuma locks . I came out that way ... . " It ' s quite a town , two churches , thirty houses , nearly ... . " The Cayuga River ' s lifting . It floods back near six miles , they say . Bad digging ... . " I had the intermittent fever .... " " And I was n't by , " thought Mary . But he looked well . His face was thinner and in some way he seemed to have grown taller . His eyes had a shine in them when he looked at her . She could tell his gladness . She felt a ripeness growing in herself , as if her being were at work in sorting out her feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoked-beef pie and brought out pickled currants.  | " Work will start next week if wagoning will open , " Jerry said . " As soon as maybe Caleb will send up the men . . . . " Melville was sanding his plough that afternoon . Sun was shining in a watery sky and the marsh beyond the windows stretched out grey and hubbly , as if the old clumps of grass were thrusting shoulders up against it . " I saw Hunter in Marcellus . He was hauling in to Utica . He ' 11 haul for Caleb again this year . He had a load of merino bales for Oriskany milling . He tells me Rochester ' s a growing town . . . . " Dorothy smiled and smiled . From time to time her eyes would swing to Mary . " Have n't we cared for her fine ? " she would ask proudly . " Do n't she look handsome to you , Jerry ? " Jerry grinned and laid his hand on Mary 's . " She does , surely . " Dorothy would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to herself . In the evening they had to show Jerry what they had made that winter . There was the coverlet completed . He felt it with his hand . " Real pretty . Look at those red stars . You might have drawed them . " There was bedding made , a flannel blanket . " They look small , " said Jerry . " It ' s time you made a cradle , I should say . You 've been an unprovidingman as ever lived , I ' d think . " Jerry grinned . " Have you got boards ? " he asked Melville . " I ' ve got a piece of half-inch pine , " said Melville . After supper , then , there was a sound of sawing as Jerry made the cradle . A simple box to fit the blanket . He whittled out the rockers with a knife . Next morning he floundered out to the wood patch and came home an hour later , red-faced , hot , and dripping , with birch wands . He peeled them carefully and worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the box . " For a hood , " he explained.  | He hung the bows against the chimney to dry and stiffen into shape . " Like a regular Pennsylvany wagon , " Melville said . " I ' d never have thought of that myself . " They all admired it  --  Dorothy , Melville , and Jerry . Mary smiled to see them tentatively poke it with their feet as they sat talking . Its rockers made a little sound ... . Over the marsh the snow seemed to collapse . It fell in in broken dishlike holes , and the grass showed through . Ponds of yellow water spread out overnight . Plover flew over it through the mist , calling . Their voices came at dawn and sunset , marking the day ... . The road opened suddenly . On the day after , Jerry said that he would have to go down to Number Two to see that everything was ready for the men . Dorothy suggested that he take the horse and drive himself down . Mary could ride with him and drive back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards Cossett 's . The sky had cleared . It was pale blue , for April , full of sunlight and unaccustomed warmth . The old horse wiggled his mulish ears and took his own route and pace ; for the road was like a long , thin pudding , clutching the wheels , and treacherously rutted with ribbonlikegleaming pools . Number Two was an exact replica of Number One in its early stages . The shanty was identical with all the others along the line . It made Jerry grin to see it and think of old Self Rogers . He told Mary about the old man , traveling the route and setting up these shanties against his conscience . The well of the lock was two feet deep in water . " We 'll have to drain it , " Jerry said . He examined all sides carefully . " There 's too much water to have just drained in . I think we will need piles . " But there was nothing he could do and he and Mary walked round to the shanty and the horse-shed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks of hoofs . After studying them a while , Jerry said , " That ' s Roberts 's pony . I wonder what he was doing here ? "  |p225Together  they took the boards off the shanty sashes and opened the doors . The shanty was full of the odor of winter . They stood to one side while the dampness drew past them , mouldy and dank , like fleeing ghosts that one could nearly see . Then they lit a roaring fire in the stove and sat together to eat their put-up luncheon . " It makes me think of being back in Utica , " said Mary . " Do you remember how we picnicked out with Bourbon , Jerry ? " He smiled at her over his bread and butter . " Yes , I do . We were new-wedded folks then , were n't we ? It seems a long time ago . And it ' s less than a year . I was n't earning but three dollars a week , those days . " " It does seem long ago , Jerry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but her face was serene with remembered sweetness . The sunlight shone in upon her , putting copper on her hair . She had let her bonnet back upon her shoulders , and the bow nestled close under her chin . " I ' m anxious to get back to work , " said Jerry . " I wonder what Roberts was doing here . " He had his answer almost immediately . Over the road they had come by sounded bells . The notes were slow in the lazy sunshine . At the door , Jerry cried , " It ' s Hunter 's team . " Mary joined him . She moved heavily and leaned herself against the door-jamb . Before she gazed out over the marsh she took a look at Jerry . There was a slight mist in her eyes ; they were soft grey to-day . She thought , " The work has caught him again . " Her breast rose softly . She had had him for so short a while . Then she turned her eyes to follow his . It was Hunter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rain-streaked swaying top of his great wagon . He himself was striding in the mud besides the sorrel wheeler . The ringing bells sparkled faintly . Cataracts of muddy water ran back from the wheels , and on either side of the road the stagnant water trembled , shivering the reeds . In clearer places a reflection was born , first the horses two by two , then Hunter , then the wagon 's box , a grey blue in the bright blue of the sky.  |p226Behind  , two more wagons lumbered . Men like monkeys clustered on the loads . She could make out Edwin Brown , the cook , and the funny , froglike figure of Cosmo Turbe crouched down beside his inseparable big friend . Hunter stopped his team beside the well . The other wagons drew past it to the shanty . The men jumped down . Those that had worked before came forward to greet Jerry . Hunter and the cook took off their hats to Mary ; but the others stayed where they were , eyeing distastefully the flooded hole . Hunter said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new contraption . Roberts says there ' s quicksand underneath the lock . You will need piling . Caleb said to tell you he was sending in the piles to-morrow . So I brought the engine for driving them and here ' s the man that works it . " From the rear of the Pennsylvania wagon strutted a small , fussy man with a bowler hat on his head and a quarter-inch black velvet ribbon round his neck against the quinsy . " Name is Bemis , " he introduced himself . He peered into the lock . " I ' ve drove piles in everything but quicksand , but they ought to go down easy . " Mary had gone back to Melville 's wagon . From the seat she watched Jerry taking hold , ordering the unloading . Edwin Brown was yelling for his helper . The other men , under the direction of Bemis , were hauling out heavy timbers from Hunter 's wagon and setting them in line upon the ground . Mary spoke to the horse and turned him homeward . No one noticed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . But on the afternoon of the following day , Hunter came back past Melville 's farm . He stopped in a moment . " They 've set up Bemis 's engine , " he said . " They ' re about ready to use it . " While he loitered , they heard it begin , a heavy thump . Then there was silence for a while , and then again the thump . All the rest of the afternoon , long after Hunter had left them , Mary andp227Dorothy heard that dull thumping going on . It was a small sound at that distance , but even so they felt the weight of the blow . " It ' s like a bittern , " Dorothy said , " only it comes too slow . " For four days it went on steadily . Thump  --  and then the interval in which she heard the life upon the farm , the noise of the blackbirdsreturning to their nesting , Melville 's voice talking to the oxen in the far lot , the dithery sound of Dorothy 's hoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an irregular tick , marking the long minutes . Her nerves were growing sensitive to time . She felt each blow , bringing her back into the world to listen again , and then the slow resurgence of herself , while her inner ears were stretched . On the fifth day , the engine stopped ; moved onward , it was reported , to the lock and aqueduct at the Otisco outlet . For a long time Mary was oppressed by silence , and time stood still for her ... . Almost daily now , men or wagons were going past into the marsh . Digging moved at a fast pace . All through the swamp the sections were occupied with men , teams , and shovels . Loads of hay went past for the horses , lumbering heavily along the corduroy , the wagon reaches squeaking ; edible-wagons for the men ; loads of tools sent in by the contractors ; wheelbarrows made of iron to hold mud , root-cutting spades shaped like the marks on playing cards ; sharp ploughs and scoops . New things , new horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . One morning , when she heard Dorothy 's voice shrill with excitement , she was slow in getting up . She would have missed the sight entirely if the young man bringing it had not unhitched his team to ask for water for them . What she saw standing in the road was an enormous pair of twelve-foot wheels , connected by an axle eight feet long , made of a tree-trunk . The spokes of a third wheel were fixed into this axle and bore on their ends a monstrous grooved tire coiled with rope . While he watered his horses the young man explained that it was an engine he had invented for pulling stumps . The big wheels were chocked on either side of the stump , a chain was fastened to it and the axle . Then he hitched the horses to the rope that wound around the inner wheel ; a simple piece of leverage , he said . Thep228stump came up like pie and the big wheels trundled it off the line , " Thank you , ma'am , " he said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the jug from her hands and drank directly from the lip . His grey eyes surveyed her shyly . Reading their admiration , she smiled back ; but she felt no emotion , and in a little while he went along , behind his monstrous wheels , whistling " The Waterman'sSong . " Dorothy laughed after him . " A likely boy , Mary . He had an eye at you . " And then she said , " To think of a young man like him inventing anything so large . " Dorothy was perpetually overcome by the wonderful things men did .... May came with a growth of green . The pastures bore their grass , and the cows , with the calf tailing them in a kind of wonderment , went out to browse . At night Dorothy put a raw leek beside each place to eat before a person drank , for the taste of the wild onions was strong in the milk . Melville sowed his barley , buckwheat , and corn , and all three spent a day in putting in potatoes . Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth , and her weariness each night offered her release . Less and less as time went on she seemed to miss Jerry . Some Sundays now he did not return at all , for he was several miles westward , working at Geddes . The June heat brought fogs out of the marsh ; and Dorothy would not allow her to go for the cows any more in the evening , for the mist carried ague . On one of the latter days of June , Dorothy had said , " It ' s nearly time for Mr. Falk to come around . " " Mr. Falk ? " Mary asked listlessly . " Yes . Harley Falk . He ' s shoemaker for us . He generally comes about this time . " When Mary heard the creak of the wheel out on the summery road , she remembered this . Melville and Dorothy had gone top229Fayetteville for buying things long needed at the farm ; and Melvilleconsidered investing a part of his last year 's earnings in some western land company . Mary had preferred to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a breath of wind , and dry weather during June had covered the road deep in dust . So she was alone in the cabin . The curtains were drawn across the open windows , dimming the drone of bees in the buttercups and making the cabin cool . But from her stool beside the hearth she could see out through the open door , over the square of sweltering grass , to the road . At length , through the mullein stalks along the fence , she saw the white ears of a horse , flopping like a mule 's to his shambling walk . He carried his head low . And following after she saw the man upon the wagon seat . He seemed to be drowsing , hunched over his wrists , which rested on his knees . She could see nothing of his face . He wore a wide black hat dusted from the road to a silvery grey , and the shoulders of his old black coat were whitened . She remembered that Dorothy had said of the cobbler , " He ' s a queerappearingman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he makes me , too , uneasy . And yet he ' s real obliging . " When he came to the end of the fence , Mary had a clear view of the horse , a thin white animal ; his uncurried coat was dull and ragged . He walked incredibly slow , with a stiff-kneed step and his muzzle dipping continually close to the road . She could see his nostrils pink as he snuffed of the way . Then he stopped , raised his head , and turned it towards the door ; and Mary saw that his eyes were as white as his coat . The horse was blind with cataracts . The driver raised his head abruptly , glanced at the cabin , and turned in his rig . Once more the wheel emitted tedious creaking ; and before Mary had had a chance properly to see the man he had passed out of sight towards the barn . She heard the wheel creak past the house into the farmyard ; and when it stopped again , the silence seemed to rise out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not move . The white eyes in the white face of the horse seemed to stare at her ; with a haunting power , as if somewhere , she could not remember when , she had seen them long ago.  | While she waited , she heard above the bee-sounds how the man was unhitching . The shafts rattled loosely as the horse stepped out of them ; she heard the feet of man and horse treading on the plank walk in the barn ; and after a while the man came out and drew a bucket at the well . Then the place was silent for a long time . She listened breathlessly for his footfalls across the yard ; but still she could not move . " Hello inside ? Is anybody here to home ? " Mary turned slowly on her stool . She did not move her hands from her lap , but the color rose in her cheeks . " Good afternoon . " Her own voice startled her . She had not heard him come , but there he was standing in the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The man had taken off his hat . In the open door he made against the shivering heat a still black silhouette . " May I come in then ? " He had a pack on one shoulder . " Are you Mr. Falk ? " He nodded . " Then you ' d better come in , " said Mary . " Both of them have work for you . " " I will come in . " He stepped across the sill and closed the door , and in the renewed cool dusk inside the cabin he moved quickly past her to the far side of the hearth and swung his pack down , as if that were an accustomedcorner . She watched him unemotionally . A big man , obviously  --  he had tremendous shoulders , long arms , and ponderous hands  --  a strangeappearingman to cobble shoes . When he undid the rawhides bindinghis pack , a scent of tanned leather was breathed forth . Mary 's nostrils quivered ; her cheeks ripened suddenly ; she felt a faint stir fingering her . Falk said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last and bench and then I ' 11 be complete . "  |p231Returning  after a moment , he put the last down beside the sack , sat himself upon the bench that held the iron upright , and pulled out his drawer of nails and tools . Then he looked across at Mary . He saw her face high-colored , her grey eyes wide and fixed on his . There was no fire in the hearth ; and the ashes , bluish-white , lay unruffled . A spot of sunshine down the chimney lighted the clay back of the fireplace , put a bright spot on a copper kettle , and covered Mary with a gentle sheen . She was dressed loosely in cool gingham , a bird's-eye blue , that draped her sympathetically . He asked , " When did Melvilles go ? " " Quite a while before noon . " She could not tell his age . Hunched upon his stool , he made a powerful figure ; but his head was small . His cheeks were smooth , as if he had just shaved . His long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight and pointed ; his forehead high and almost transparently white  --  a strange face for a man . His eyes were brown of an indeterminate sort ; when they met the light inside the chimney they showed a green tinge . Save for the drone of bees beyond the curtains , the cabin harbored utter stillness . Suddenly he asked , " You do n't know what kind of shoes either one of them would want , do you ? " Mary shook her head . Her eyes were fixed on his ; following their wandering up and down her figure ; meeting them whenever they found hers . He said , " That ' s too bad . If I knew that , I could begin cutting . " His broad fingers dipped into a drawer and pulled out a knife . The blade looked tiny in his fist ; it was curved , whetted along the inside edge . " What 's your name ? " he asked . " Mary Fowler . " " Mary Fowler , " he repeated it after her , his long upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melvilles ? " " I ' m boarding here . "  |p232She  felt his eyes reading her body . " Your husband ' s working on the canal ? " " Yes . He ' s a foreman for Caleb Hammil . " " On the locks , then ? " " Yes . " " He is away ? " " Yes , he ' s away . " Her voice was oddly toneless . " He ' s been away for long ? " " For a long time . " " He ought to be back before so long . " " I do n't know . " Suddenly the man smiled . His teeth , catching the light , were small , even , and white . " You get lonesome . " " Sometimes . " " I ' ve noticed women do . It ' s too bad . Some men work hard ; they have n't understanding  --  well men have n't . " Mary was silent . But in her heart a little prick of gratitude was stirred . Little by little her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had turned his eyes away from hers and was staring through the open door . A strange man , she thought  --  and she felt queerly sorry for him , with his face and body so mismated . " Have you always been a cobbler , Mr. Falk ? " He started . " No . " He bit the word off short . She said , " Myself , I need a new pair of boots . Would you care to make me one ? " As she turned she saw eagerness in his eyes . They had a peculiar humility , like the dog of a dishonest man . " I ' d be glad to . What kind of a boot , Mrs. Fowler ? " " A regular boot . Not too high . One to use in housework or for walking . " " I 've got some especial calfskin . Not too heavy . " He bent overp 233the sack . In a moment his big hands had found the leather he was seeking and he brought it to her . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tanned scent breathed out from it seemed to weight her eyelids . " It ' s nice , " said Mary . " It ' s fine leather . It will wear , and it will shape to meet your foot . " He bent down before her on one knee and took her foot in his hand . Then his big fingers unlaced the old boot , with its wear , its thin sole , all the voyage from England in it and the miles westward she had traveled . His hands were caressing as he handled it , drawingit off and taking her foot ; it followed her ankle downward , cupping the heel and feeling of the arch . " High arches . " She shivered distantly , and only by an effort kept her open eyes upon his hand . " So seldom are there arches built like yours . Not out here . The women 's feet are coarse from working inside heavy boots . They let them down . " His hand held the arch , but suddenly the other hand was taking her toes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a steady pulse , whether hers or his she did not know , but there was a mounting rhythm in the beat . Yet , when he continued , his voice was steady . " A long second toe is a thing many Albany belles would crave . It makes the natural foot . It is a beauty for a woman . " He slowly raised his face . What she saw Mary did not choose to read beyond the humility . " Can I see it bare ? " he asked her . " It is n't often . " Mary 's hands obeyed . She swung herself a little to one side and reached inside her skirt . She pulled the stocking to her knee . " Shameless , " she thought ; but she was shameless . He took the rolled edge of brown cotton and slowly bared the leg . She felt the coolness of the cabin strike against the skin , his soft palms and the calloused finger-tips made rough by tack-points . The shivering again possessed her . Her color came into her cheeks : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he looked at her , and all at once , in the cabin dusk , she felt a chill , and she saw not his eyes but the white , sightless eyes that she remembered in the horse . This was a thing she had not willed to do ; her will was not her own . There was an impulse in her like the wind ; and she put her hands in her lap to hide them , feeling them like leaves . But the cobbler was quietly examining the foot . After a while he slipped the stocking on , and to Mary 's ears the dim droning of the bees returned . She saw the mullein stalks beyond the roadfence , the sky burnished blue , with small hot clouds in it . He finished lacing up the shoe . It seemed to Mary that the incident was a thing long past . She watched him now impersonally , cutting the leather from memory , bending it in his big hands . He laid out his needle , waxed his threads . The needle caught a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As he worked , they talked . He said he had been born back east . He did not say why he had left New England , but he told her all the places he had seen . " It ' s as if I had a beast inside me gnawing . I get restless . I have n't worked a district more than five years ever . " " Have you worked many ? " " Eight , I mind . " " You would n't look that old . " " Generally I do n't dwell five years on one . " " Oh . " " I ' m not yet forty-five , if you would want to know . " " How did you come to cobbling , Mr. Falk ? " " It was a way to make a living , when I went out into new country . " " Oh . " " People do n't always like me , " he explained . " I do n't know why . The men do n't and some women are afeared . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt sorry for him.  | He said he had been eastward . " They ' ve had some trouble with the diggers . Irish and niggers do n't mix . Any man can get a job . There ' ye been riots . They pay them part in whiskey . Men together fashion strange ideas . " She watched his leather taking shape under his big skilled fingers . It was magical . When the Melvilles returned before sunset , old Squirrel dragging the wagon tiredly , Falk 's hammer was tapping . The cabin had grown darker as the light crept up the chimney out to westward . And Mary was quiet with a strange sense of an inner freedom , talking to this man . He listened well , waiting to catch her roundabout allusions ; and his understanding eyes would veil themselves at her voice and when she was silent look deeply into her . " So soon as I heard that hammer , " Dorothy cried , " I said to Robert , Mr. Falk has come . ' I ' m glad to see you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the shoes he made for Mary . Dorothy stripped off her straw bonnet . Her wispy grey hair looked tight as ever behind her homely face . She turned her eyes searchinglyon Mary and made a mouth to herself . Then she looked at the shoes . " My , are n't they pretty ones ! Alike as alike , and shaped like city kid . " She laughed at Falk . " You never made a pair of shoes like that for me . " He raised his face to hers . " Oh , do n't deny ! " she said . " I know why . The reason ' s there . " She stretched her own long foot out underneath her skirt . Dust was on the old boot . Falk examined it with his eyes , then raised them to her face . " It ' s worn well , " he said ; but Mary saw that Dorothy drew back , and her face became cold . That evening , as Falk completed his work , she and Robert sat quietly watching him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supper onwards . Only when Mary tried on the shoes and felt his hands lacing them , and the leather like a caress through the stocking against herp236skin , did she feel a return of the release of spirits that had so stirred her that afternoon . She noticed afterwards , for the two days he worked at the farm , that Melville kept himself occupied not far from home ; and twice she came upon him exchanging low talk with Dorothy , which they turned awkwardly into an open channel . But once as she milked at twilight Falk came into the barn , where his things were and where he slept , and leaned for a moment against the post . She felt his eyes on her bent shoulders , where the collar of her dress gaped loosely up . She did not speak , but her hands became more conscious of the milk . At length he said , " I ' m through to-morrow . I wo n't forget our afternoon together . " He passed her quietly , going out again . But after he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday , she became aware of a strange unholiness in her thoughts which she tried to put away ; and the white eyes of Harley Falk 's white horse would enter her dreams as if through them the man himself watched her secret thinking . " In some old countries women kneel " MARY had dispossessed the Melvilles of their bed . She lay straight out upon her back , her feet against the footboard , her wrists in leather loops . One of Squirrel 's reins had been passed round the footboard and under the bedding with loops stitched in the ends for her to grasp . But now she had a respite ; her senses were released from their inward fury and fled out on dusky paths . . . . Between two rafters dwelt a spider . She wondered how many days ago he had set up his web . She had seen him when they first had put her in the bed ; he was connecting a new brace , his hands marvelously deft in spreading the sheaf of threads he spun . But , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 237bedside , the spider had been troubled . Mary had seen him hiding himself inside his web , as if he would have closed his lidless eyes ; and now when the quiet returned he had made up his mind  --  he was reeling in skein after skein in readiness for moving . She watched him till he had unfastened the last thin , silken anchor . He lingered a moment as if to take one farewell look . Then he put out his hands and began his scuttling travel . Choosing the shadow of a rafter , he ran the whole length of the ceiling . Mary saw his body five times lift to cross a rafter upside down before he scrambled down the wall and ducked out through the door ... . In the big bed her body felt indescribably small . The wide spread of sheets was like the ocean she remembered crossing  --  years and years the crossing seemed , years before she had seen Jerry , years beforeshe had come westward to her stay in Utica , and years again before she had moved on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time was in her back ; time absorbed her being . They had taken time together to fashion it ; and now time was seeking freedom . Immediately she heard a stool-leg gently bump and Mrs. Hovey was bending over the pillow . " Well , dearie . " Mary opened her eyes . It was the first time she had taken a coherent look at Mrs. Hovey . " Ma Hovey , " Dorothy named her ; for it was said that she had helped at half the births in Onondaga County . She had arrived with Melville early in the afternoon , a jouncing figure crowding him halfway off the wagon seat . Squirrel dripped lather to his stifles ; but Ma Hovey had no eye for him . Directly , she had scrambled down and waddled into the cabin , and before her shawl was off she had taken the command from Dorothy . " She ' 11 use this bed right now . Later we 'll ready the table for her when it ' s time . " Mary had not noticed her face , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 11 be time and time , " Mary had heard her voice . " How is it , dearie ? Pretty bad ? "  |p238She  had not expected an answer : Mary felt that her hands would tell her whatever might be needful . She heard her saying to Dorothy , " A fine girl for bearing . I ' m not troubled . And she ' s healthy . I should estimate a girl by place and action . Light a fire . " Now Mary saw her face  --  round-checked , with a small , serious mouth , and unworn eyes . Her skin was freshly pink and white  --  a strange thing in so old a woman living westward ; only her hands were toil-scarred . Ma Hovey brought a pitcher of cool water and a rag and pressed the hair back from Mary 's forehead . " Does that feel better , dearie ? " Mary nodded . " Rest yourself , then , all you can . " For a moment the unworn eyes , clear blue , looked down into Mary 's wide grey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she was soothed as if white clouds touched her with dry soft coolness . Mary obediently closed her eyes , but when she heard Ma Hovey 's broad feet turn away she opened them and looked at the grizzled curly hair caught neatly in its crocheted purple basket . There was a distinct spring in the old woman 's step . Bringing a woman through childbirth was the stuff of life to her ; when she put her hands upon a laboring body , she put her own years out of sight . She sat down softly on her stool , and Mary heard her laying down laws upon laws to Dorothy . Dorothy 's voice was humble . To the last moment , her homely face had kept its determined cheerfulness . She had made little jokes with Jerry . Had he thought of twins , for instance ? Would he like it four in family ? But when Ma Hovey came , she had relapsed into a frightened creature who held Mary dear . But Mary had not cared ; these things were all like wind at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said , " You might as well fetch Dr. Earl . " Both men had said that they would go . He was expecting ; he would be ready ; he had promised , at a word.  | " One of you two had ought to stay . " Dorothy sounded panicked . Ma Hovey grunted . " No , let them both get out . They ' re no use , their dreary faces . " But Robert had gone alone . " I 'd feel ashamed , " said Jerry . Mary wondered where he was . She did not want to see him . She resented the fright in his eyes that infected her in her still moments . But she listened now . Would he be by the well , perhaps , getting himself a drink of cool ? Or would he be out in the barn ? Or maybe listening by the back window , where the cockscomb lifted shriveled tufts ? What she could see her eyes found tiresome . The smell of steamingwater on the hearth was stifling in her nostrils ; her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she lay dully at the mercy of the things that made a man and woman . A little breath of night air stole through the slightly opened door . She seemed to feel it coming long before it came to her . She was aware of it creeping past the ankles of the seated women ; it flickered the fire gently ; it stole on across the floor to the foot of the bed and tried to lift itself . She lay deathly still , unable to help it , seeking to will it upwards . Then it did rise across the sheet ; it stole upon her body with its cooling finger-tips ; she felt it in her nostrils , damp and sweet with meadow smells . It eased her eyelids , and touched the stiff skin on her forehead , chilling the bubbles of sweat . For a precious breathless instant , it carried her senses through the cabin walls . How was it that she could hear through the dry , piled logs the beat in the night outside : the ticking of the crickets ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the small creeping things underground and on the ground  --  the moles , the grubs , the worms ; the wet sly inching of the marsh slugs ; the ants awake in sandy palaces ; the spiders casting their dew-pearled threads ; the gnats that hatch in darkness , troubling the still pools ; the unseen midget things that make the pulse and keep the earth alive ?  | She had not been born in these wide sprawling lands , she had not grown where one burnt acre stood for the first work of a man against the wilderness ; yet her senses were alive to them , as if the soft hollow in her hardened palms could feel the whole world sleeping . And then through it her stretched ears caught the steady crunch of boots upon the road . They trod stiffly back from Onondaga way , and she remembered that night before the spring came , so long ago , when Jerry walked to her out of the mist . She knew his step . He stopped at the turn-in to the cabin . She could imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her heart hardened in her . He had turned away . The dismal burden of his boots crunched out the precious little sounds . The burden entered her , her eyelids were made heavy , and her heart bent down ... . " He 's young , " Ma Hovey was saying just above the gentle beatingof the fire . " But he ' s been civil to me and I do allow that he does well . A young doctor , but minded to learn from those that know his business better . He does n't hold with cotton swathe or cricket mark or twice around the basket , but he ' s young . Young people do n't believe  --  Hark ! There ' s the boy . Poor boy . I feel a pity for him . Hush ... . " Yes , dearie , coming on ? Let them . Old Ma ' s tending of you . Carry them through , stronger . But not too strong . You ' ve got a long ways to travel , dearie , but you ' re fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be easier . My , that was a dandy big one ! That ' s the kind that counts . Yes , I know it . Yes , but that ' s the kind . It ' s like an extra horse hitched to a wagon . Guarantees you through the bog holes . But do n't think of it . Do n't think of anything , dearie . That ' s a fine girl . That ' s a good one , too . You 've got a good long ways to travel , but Ma Hovey ' s riding with you . . . . " Yes , Mrs. Melville . Still some time ; but just the same , that young man of a doctor might as well turn up or else I ' 11 have to get him a surprise to greet him . . . . " No , now do n't look worried , Mrs. Melville . Land to goodness , Ma Hovey ' s brought a basketful of babies free with her own self . You need n't be a-worrit . Give the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like , and leave him stay to home  --  that ' s what I ' d say . But this boy ' s like them all . He ' s earning money and thinks he ' s bound to spend it . Like a funeral , too . What good ' s a coffin ? Oh , I 've laid them out , poor things . Three that I helped to being born . The same very hands , identical , these here . It ' s funny ... . " Yes , I 've helped my lot of babies . I always call them mine , Mrs. Melville . And why not ? A good percentage of them would n't be at all except for me . I mind the first . The doctor could n't make it in his sleigh with two fat horses . Could n't venture it . Those horses got floundered down in snow , he said , and he was troubled with deep rheumatism , making him lame . But I walked in on Indian snowshoes . I went out that afternoon , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half , a yard of India cloth . I was n't troubled by a pair of horses . Yes , it was Tremaster 's boy . She was a little thing , no more than a curled leaf to handle , and the baby ranting in her like a scalping redskin . The man ' s no better than a howling baby himself . I saw that just at once I got inside the door and stamped the snow off'n the shoes . So I told him , Wipe your nose and boil some water . ' He done it , but he never liked me after . I showed him how to hold her hands , and I did everything . At least the baby did , a ranting boy ; I never knew one lust so hard for air . He ' d got the cord around his neck and was choked blue . I do declare he swore in French when I had cut him free . And do you know there was n't thread in all that house ? Poor little pretty , out there striving in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woolen skirt of English weave and I unraveled a thread . Yes , Mrs. Melville . And there was n't any harm , and the boy ' s a man now down in Albany , making speeches in Assembly , no doubt about canals . Oh , well , Tremaster never really liked me , I suppose . And that was how I started in , so do n't you fret yourself . . . . " Yes , dearie , if you want a sip . Now take a good hold of them straps . Drive yourself if you ' re so minded . There ' s hills and rivers , but there 's time . I 'll cool you , dearie ... . " Yes , Mrs. Melville . He better had turn up . You and me mightp242just as well arrange the table . Yes , it ' s hard ; but that ' s all right . There ' s nothing comfortabler than a good stout table , all concerned . The places I 've seen babies born in ! In some old countries women kneel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her man just held her there , between his knees . They were moving westward ; it came on sudden ; and there was n't chance to bring her to a house . Twins , I tell you , for a fact . Under a beech tree with the curiousest little chipmunk . That ' s it  --  just stretch it that way . " Now , Mrs. Melville , let ' s us set down and wait a minute , comfortable . My feet get tiresome to me sometimes and if I do n't set down I get all wearied . If you had a wet of cordial , and you might cook up a little tea to give her after . Not too strong and without sugar . Bohea tea ' s the best , though I do n't gainsay a cup of hyson , and the city people fancy souchong . Yes , I am slightly partial to peach cordial . It ' s a pleasant drink for surely . It settles flutters in a woman . Good for you , too , Mr. Melville . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might just companionate what I 've got left here with a small drop more . I make mine in a burnt-oak keg , but this is very tasty . There ! There ' s the doctor . Yes , he ' s comingfast . That quiet boy has stopped him . Asking how his wife is , probably . And the doctor says she ' s dandy . Oh , well , you might as well set back those glasses , Mrs. Melville . I ' d rather he had nothing till we ' re finished . Out of sight is out of thinking .... " Yes , Dr. Earl . We ' re doing nicely . . . . " Mary no longer cared to ravel out the messages her twisted senses carried to her . She tried to fetch a smile forth for the doctor ; she saw his face bent over her , the lamplight on the tightened skin beside his eyes , the slow contraction of his pupils after his dark night ride . It was the face of a young man under thirty , with shaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " How are they , Mrs. Fowler ? Pretty bad ? " She nodded . His clothes smelled strong of horse-sweat and tobacco . He had curling hair , cropped short , bright brown in color.  | " Everything ' s fine , " she heard Ma Hovey telling him ; and his voice , " Good . " And Ma Hovey , a bit spiffily , " I expect you ' 11 want to see for yourself . " Their faces with their voices swam backward . When they returned , the doctor was speaking . " You ' re quite right , as usual , Mrs. Hovey  --  though I think you underestimate the time . " Ma Hovey 's voice was pleased . " She ' s one of them that gets determined on it , Doctor . " " Maybe so . I ' ll wash my hands now . " Dorothy bustled for a basin and a clean towel for him , but Ma Hovey lingered by the bed , tending Mary with a proprietary bending . " You ' re doing finely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Does it feel better when I put my arm down under it ? " The doctor seated himself beside the hearth and pulled his pipe out . He whittled off tobacco in his palm and stuffed the bowl . The rich blue coils of smoke were tapered out and whisked into the chimney . " The road surprised me , " he said to Dorothy . " I expected it much rougher with all the heavy travel passing over it . " " You did n't have no trouble finding here ? " " No , no . Not a bit . I ' d been up to the corners less than a week ago . A man got knifed in the gang that ' s working next to Cossett 's tavern . Whiskey brawling , I expect . They got me Sunday morning . So all I had to do was turn right , there , instead of left , and yours is the first house . " He wiped the crumpled leavings of the whittled plug off on his trouser knees . " Come in , Mr. Fowler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Jerry . " Want to see me ? " Jerry was wordless , but the doctor read his eyes . He stepped through the doorway with him , his arm on Jerry 's shoulder . " Everything looks right enough . Do n't worry . " Ma Hovey returned to the hearth.  | " A nice young man , I think , " said Dorothy , her voice stiff and thin . Ma Hovey grunted in her short , round nose . The doctor was gone for several minutes . Once in an interval Mary heard his footsteps matching Jerry 's in the front yard . The beat was methodical , heavy , a little out of stride . What right had Jerry to keep the doctor outside ? She wanted to see him again . She was pinning her faith on his optimistic face . She must see it . She shut her teeth together , closing sound . Dorothy looked timidly over the bed . There were little bulges just beside the corners of her homely mouth . She glanced at Mary 's eyes , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then Ma Hovey 's clear blue eyes swam up beside Dorothy 's head . Her hand came out to rest on the set forehead . " What is it now , dearie ? " Mary 's lips were calm in their deliberate speaking . Her voice was surprisingly clear . She heard herself :  --  " I think it ' s beginning to happen . " Ma Hovey had ducked down with questing hands . Mary heard Dorothy mumbling something . Words were slurred . " I never knowed there was such power in a body . " " Go get in that doctor , " Ma said shortly . Then Mary 's sensations boiled out like a flume . She heard Dorothy : " Come inside , Dr. Earl . " The doctor 's quick heavy steps . Her own distortion . Her lips opening . Jerry 's footfalls halting at the door , stock-still . The silence . Then the lamp swam down and round and she was on a harder bed . The firelight was red , red , red . She saw herself upon a road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes looked down and saw not even pebbles . A wheel kept creaking , way off somewhere . It approached irregularly from behind . Voices kept talking , sharp hard-breathed snatches . The creak came on . She made a desperate effort , but the revolutionof the earth held back her feet . There was a darkness not far off , a black lid above the light that someone was putting down . The creak came clearer . She dared not look around . That sound . It creaked again . She shut her teeth and did not hear it . But the blackness was inexorable . There was but the thinnest ray of light . A knife edge at the edge of the world . It entered . She had not heard the wheel that turned ; but now it came again beside her ear . She saw a white face , she saw the bones under the skin , and the white sightless eyes . And in each eye a mirrored face ... . Time had been ... . She heard the doctor laugh . He held a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her ' s a lovely . " She was bustling . Somebody was weeping . " Here , you hold her , Mrs. Melville . " The evolution had caught up with her and passed , and she was free . She closed her eyes . Heat that was deathly all day long , sweltering marsh-side heat that shimmered in lazy waves over the still , high grass , that killed the sounds of passing wagons , that dulled men 's voices ; in the wood lot south of the barn the locusts made an all-day sawing . But the log walls of the cabin enclosed coolness born of the living , unsunned earth on which the puncheons rested . It lapped round Mary , cradling her . It stilled Jerry 's eyes when he sat at the bedside , holding her hand in quiet . It put a change on Melville whenever he came in from reaping , and when he went forth again the clack of the whetstone on the scythe fell through the torrid shrieks of the cicadas like drops of water . In the quiet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the food she had , fresh beans and young potatoes ; squash , too , were forming ; for supper she went out for the fresh wheat and ground it in a small burnt-oak mortar by the kitchen door and made milk mush of the milky grains . As regular as time , she came into the kitchen , her long face red with sunlight , to watch Ma Hovey emptying the cradle and moving softly for the bed . Those were the moments that marked Mary 's being for her now . She would see Ma Hovey with the corner of her eye and hear her movements making ready . Outside , Melville 's scythe would shearp248Ma Hovey ; and Ma Hovey came in and helped her make ready for sleep . They were alone , then , like two women at a mystery , when the night was breathing just beyond the window . And she wished this time might never end . " He said the woman had a baby " MARY sat in the cabin doorway sewing patches on a shirt of Jerry 's . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of him to mend his clothes ; and all she could find for her penitence was this tattered shirt he had left behind two months ago . Dorothy said that the shirt was not worth mending : " I would n't touch no shirt of Robert 's was so disconnected . " The elbows were completely raveled out ; and a piece of the tail had been cut off and sewed for an extra pocket on the breast . The small , uneven , manlike stitches made her face sober . October was coming in . Down beside the marsh the maple which stood with half its roots in water was touched on the northwardside with pinkish red . The marsh grass was acquiring yellow , and the meadow had turned a duller green . The blackbirds flew in mammoth flocks , higher than in summer ; and when they settled , the grass was jarred with their unceasing bickers . The arch of the sky was untouched blue ; and the sun shone strongly . Mary had the baby in the cradle on the doorstone . She was sleepingnow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her foot to hear the rockers mutter on the uneven sill . Then she looked up and out across the marsh . Many of the diggers had passed on . One shanty smoke with which she had been long familiar rose no more ; and Melville said that the contractor had his section finished . You could see his section shaped , the prism for the water , and the towpath wide enough for horses , and on the other side the narrow berm . But here and there for miles both east and west the littlep249knots of men were digging slowly . To Mary it was all a dream . She thought of it now , vaguely , for the shirt in her lap and the needle in her fingers . The needle needed threading . Mary stared westward . Far away she saw a dust cloud traveling along the fence . It approached her with an unwavering swiftness that even to her eye carried a familiar gait . After a little she saw the horse 's head , held high , with the small ears freshly pointed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she recognized immediately . She made herself ready to wave ; for he was traveling at such a pace that she supposed he wished to reach Utica at nightfall in the very least . His head was bared to the sun and his fat red cheeks were wind-burned . He grasped the reins in a fat hand and Mary saw the mouth of the racing horse half opened by his weight of wrist . There was no mistaking Caleb Hammil . As he came to the corner of Melville 's first field he spied Mary seated in the cabin door . He waved his hat , yanked the right rein  --  and Bourbon took the turn-in skillfully , lifting the inside wheel and snapping the rear ones into line . He braced his feet and slid to stop . Never heeding him , Hammil threw the reins over the dashboard and hopped off . His fat face beamed . " Hello there , " he said . " How are you now ? " Mary smiled " just finely , " she said , looking down . The fat man followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisper . " So that ' s the baby . A girl , I 've heard tell ; a pretty one . Can I look at her ? " " Yes . She ' s sleeping now . " " Just to see her face . Do n't wake her , Mrs. Fowler . I 'll bend down . " He knelt before the cradle 's foot and with infinite pains stretched one fat hand forth to lift the blanket 's edge . His breath whistled from the effort of kneeling.  | " It ' s a pretty baby . Takes after you , I judge , " he whispered . " I ' m real glad it came out well . " He let the blanket fall back into place and carefully got to his feet . " Can I set down and visit a little spell ? " " Yes , please . But let ' s go in . Ca n't I get you something ? " " No . I ' ve ate an hour since . " " Some milk  --  a piece of pie ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of pie ? " Mary smiled . The contractor always made her think of an eager little boy . He had no consciousness of self . " Fresh currant , Mr. Hammil . " " Well , a little piece . " She fetched it . He had seated himself at table with his hat between his outstretched hands . She sat down opposite and watched him eat a quarter piece of pie and drink his milk . Now and then he would look shyly at her . Finally he wiped his lips and said , " Mrs. Fowler , you know I ' m fond of Jerry . " Mary said nothing . " He ' s a good boy . But his ambitiousness is likely to do him harm some day . " " What is it ? " she asked quietly . " We ' re going to split . When he does Byron lock , his contract with me ' s finished . That ' s going to be next month . I made a special trip to see him about staying with me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted him to work for me . I ' ve been paying him well and I offered him some more . But he said it was n't enough . He was talking kind of high and mighty . I did n't pay no attention to that , for I was a young lad myself . But I showed him I could n't pay him any more and make a proper profit under my contracts . " His face was sober . " Where are the Melvilles ? " Mary said , " They ' re out back in the lot , digging the potatoes . "  |p251Hammil  nodded . " I just did n't want to have them break in onto us . " He looked down at his fists , which made a gathering gesture . " I do n't know what it is . But Jerry appears changed to me . I noticed it back when we completed Number One . And all the way home from Jordan I thought I ' d drop in to ask if you knew what it was on his mind . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's why I took this road instead of the Pike . " Mary too looked from the window . She did n't want to hurt him by telling him that Jerry was jealous . Jerry , she saw , had no right to be . " I do n't know . " " I thought he might have told you it . " Hammil sighed . " That ' s why I determined to stop by . " Mary felt a kind of hush steal into her . " What happened ? " Hammil said , " I guess I lost my temper . I told him I had brought him out of nothing and that he owed me gratitude . I ' m sorry I said it , because he ' s earned his earnings . I have n't had to be out here at all . He ' s done the locks about a third again as fast as what I had expected . He ' s a fine workman and knows twice as much about lock-building as I 'll ever get into my noodle . That ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . I ' ve got other men working on my culvert contracts , but not one capable of making locks . But it ai n't all that . I ' d thought that maybe soon I 'd make him partner with me . Only he ' s too young and too unsettled just a while yet . Good land , ma'am , it took me ten years to get ahead the way he ' s done in one . He do n't realize he ' s made his progress because I had my money back of him . But then he ' s more able than I was . I do n't deny . Roberts and Mr. Wright , the both of them , say he 's doing the best timber work they have on this-here section . " His face was a comical mixture of injured pride and real affection . Mary felt her heart lean towards him . " What do you want me to do ? " " I thought , when you saw him , and found him favorable , youp252might just say that Hammil would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  Hammil glanced at the cradle sunning in the doorway  --  " and he ought to get established . Do you know what his ideas are ? " Mary said , " He wants to work westward with the canal , I think  --  And then him and Roger Hunter talk of starting a boat business . " " That would take money . He 's earning fast and saving nearly all . But he ca n't put money all in boats and start a home for you two . " " I know , " said Mary . She hesitated , testing words for meanings . " Since the baby there got born , I ' ve been thinking . It seems someways Jerry ' s younger than I am . He ' s got a kind of feeling after this canal . It ai n't just money to him . " Hammil snorted angrily . " I thought he had some fool idea . He ' d better stick with me . Of course it ' s money . That ' s the whole notion of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he knows that , for I told him . But I thought he wanted money . " " Yes , he does . " " Yes . But what in nation does he want besides ? It does beat all . " " Yes . It does . I guess we ca n't understand . " " He raises my bile . He needs a lesson . " Suddenly the fat man caught Mary 's sympathetic eye . He looked confounded . Then they laughed together . " Just the same , " he said , " what I told you goes . Ungrateful or uppish or the Lord knows what , I ' ve got a fondness for him . I have for both of you , " he grinned again winningly and slapped his leg , " for the whole three of you . " Mary said , smiling , " I do n't think Jerry is ungrateful . And I ' 11 always remember you kindly , you and Mrs. Hammil . " Caleb waved his hand . " Oh , that work was nothing . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moan about it now you ' re gone . " His face grew tender . " Once Jerry told me how you and him met up . I guessp253that ' s what got me fond of you . But I promised never to tell anyone . You see he ' s proud . " Mary nodded . " That ' s it , " cried Caleb . " He ' s proud  --  proud as the black devil . " " Yes , " said Mary . " Sometimes it makes him worry . " Caleb looked as if everything were settled . " Hell ! " he said . " I 'm proud myself ! I never thought of that . You ' 11 tell Jerry , wo n't you ? " " I wo n't see him for some time , most probably . " In the act of getting up to go , Caleb 's jaw struck open . " I ' d almost forgot ! He asked me to tell you to come out and meet with him in Montezuma . " " Move ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonished . " Hunter ' s going through next month . I ' m to tell him to stop for you . " " Yes . " " I ' d best get along . You wo n't forget . " His fat bulk loomed over her . " No . " " He says he 'll have a place ready for you in the village there . " " Yes . " Hammil looked right and left . His mouth framed words . But he did not seem able to speak . " I ' d better get to going , " he said at last . " Good-bye . " Mary watched him roll out of the door . He went elaborately on tiptoe past the cradle , turned the horse , and bellowed , " Get up , Bourbon . " The wheels rattled through the yard and down the road . The dust they raised came floating back . Mary sat still at the table . To have to move , when she felt just established ! She saw that she could not make a home of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave them now . She had a thought of herself , packing up and moving all her life , following Jerry westward . Suddenly the corners of her mouth bent down in a little bitter smile . There was little enough to pack . She looked out through the door . Then she sprang to her feet . The baby had worked loose her blanket . She went out . One thing at least had been established in her life . As she bent over , she talked softly . Across the marsh , by Cossett 's , a shanty cook was beating his wagontiregong . The flatulent notes were harsh . Blackbirds swarmed aloft , alive with jibbered protest . Mary 's breasts grew heavy . She brought the baby in and made ready for its supper . Her head bent over its small face , her hair touching its cheek . The springs were rising in her , and a little haunting tune sang in her head :  --  " Awake , awake , you drowsy sleeper , Awake and listen unto me . " When the potato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was calm again . She told Dorothy as they got supper . Dorothy 's long face reddened ; her lips compressed . " It ai n't no time to move you . Has n't he any consideration ? " " I could n't stay here with you forever , Dorothy . " " Ai n't we been good to you ? " " Yes , Dorothy . I think my own mother could n't have tended me better . " Dorothy 's face softened . Tears came into her eyes . " But then  --  but , Mary , I ' d like to keep you here till I died . And think of you staying on after . " Mary kissed her . Tall , and gaunt , and wordless , Dorothy hugged her close . Her eyes stared over Mary 's head . Her lips silently framed , " That Jerry ! " Mary said quietly : " You ' d follow after Robert , would n't you , Dorothy ? " " I suppose I would . " Dorothy tried to laugh . " Then you must n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel herself.  |p255Mary  had a letter : the mail had left it in Orville and a man brought it up as a favor . It was marked important on the address side . The carrier was a young man . " Set down , mister .... " He flushed . " Elverta Judkins . " Looking at his stodgy face , the smallish eyes ill at ease , yet bound , as she supposed , to discover the contents of the important letter , Dorothy almost giggled . She avoided Mary 's eye as she invited him to sit down . " It was real kind in you , Mr. Judkins . " " ' T were n't neither , " said Elverta . " My uncle ' s storekeeper . " " Oh yes  --  Mr. Diderick . Yes , surely . " " Well , he looked that letter over , and him and Pa considered it . And Pa said , seeing as how it was Sunday , and the Lord 's day , I might as well straddle the colt and come along . " Dorothy bubbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mary ? "  --  though they knew it must be from Hunter . Mary said , " It ' s an expensive-appearing letter . " " One sheet , " said Judkins , peering over . " Uncle says it . Twentyfivecents postage wrote in the corner . That ' s one sheet and seventy-five miles travel  --  less maybe , but not more . By postage law . " Mary opened it deliberately . Then she passed it over to Dorothy . " Does n't seem as though I could make to read it . You do , Dorothy . " Dorothy mouthed the spelling . " Yes , it is from Roger Hunter  --  signs himself your servant , Mary . Says Caleb told him to pick you up for Montezuma . Good land ! " Dorothy forgot her game . " Says he ' s coming Wednesday  --  early . Getting here by sunrise  --  my , that ' s seven o'clock . " Dorothy and Mary stared silently at each other . The tall woman 's face was tragically expressionless . " So soon , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he asked , " That ' s all there is in to it ? " " Yes , " said Dorothy bitterly , " every bit . " " Well , then , I might as well be going home . " He sounded disappointed . " It was real kind of you to fetch it , Mr. Judkins , " Mary said . " ' T were n't neither . " " I take it kind , " she repeated dully . His hands kept twisting his limp hat . " No , ' t were n't , " he said again , stubbing his toe against a puncheon . Then he turned and ran out . They heard him vault onto the colt , heard his heels thwack the ribs , and the colt 's spirited scrabble in the yard and thudding hoofs along the road . Dorothy looked across . " Well , dearie . " Her voice was old and sad ... . Long before the wagon came , they heard the Pennsylvania Bells . The haunting rhythm of the long-walking horse was in their notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver wire . The baby whimpered fretfully . " She ' s not used , " said Dorothy , holding her . " So early . " " It ' 11 be something maybe for her to tell some day , that she rode in a Pennsylvany wagon , " Melville said , his long face honestly lugubrious . Mary looked anxiously over her bundles . One for herself . Insidewere her clothes and the baby 's extra bedding and some gifts from the Melvilles  --  a lustre teapot for herself , and a little pewter cup for the baby when the time came for her to drink from it . Holding her now , Dorothy wondered if she would ever see her drink from it . Beside the big bundle was the baby 's own little one , wrapped in a piece of scarlet calico , the four ends knotted . And next to that was the cradle . Three things to remember . " You 've got your money ? " " Yes . It ' s in the teapot , " Mary said.  |p257They  remained silent , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighted the cabin . The air was cold . The first burst of flaming in the hearth had subsided , and the coals glowed mellowly . Mary did not look at them . She kept her eyes on the window till she saw the horses and the great hood of the wagon . Then she picked up the baby 's bundle and stepped out . Dorothy came after with the baby . Hushed , Melville brought the other things . The team did not turn in . It took too long to turn a wagon of that size in a small farmyard . But Hunter walked up to meet them . " Sorry to be so early . We must get through by dark . It ' s thirtythreemiles and heavy going since the rain . " His brown face was friendly , and he said tactfully little . It was but a moment before he had hoisted Mary to the high seat . Dorothy reached the baby up on quivering arms . Her lips were shaking . While Melville and Hunter stowed the big bundle and the cradle in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other 's faces . It was a time when women spoke without words , their understandingclear between them ; but when the men came forward Dorothy said , " Good-bye , dearie . Good-bye , both , " stiffly , as if it were a foreign speech . Melville bared his head . " Good-bye , both , " said Mary . Hunter looked at them , then mercifully uncoiled his whip . It cracked . The horses ' heads went down , as though they made obeisance to the road , and Mary felt the wheels stir under her , and the great wagon come to life . It rolled . She leaned round the hood and waved her hand . Then she faced front ... . She sat still on the high seat , the circular opening of the hood framing her red-shawled head . The bundle , in which the baby now had gone to sleep , lay over her knees , and the crook of her left elbow felt the hard spot through the wadding that marked the baby 's head . She lifted the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked a moment at the short , dark lashes bent against the round of cheek . Then she closed the flaps against the morning marsh mist , and stared forth along the road.  |p258From  her high place she looked directly down on the six broad backs . The leaders alone were matched in color , coal black . Their long-walking stride was mated so perfectly that they moved like a machine . ' Mary could see no slack trace in all the twelve . Almost within touch of her feet the arches over the wheelers ' withers carried the six silver bells . By bending forward she could see Hunter walking , his stride matched to his horses ' , just beside the shoulder of the off-wheeler . His whip was coiled about his wrist . His hat was tilted back from his face and his eyes were on the road ahead . Under her she felt a rolling from the wheels . The seat jutted far forward beyond the front axle , even over the wheelers ' rumps , so that when the wheels went into a sink hole she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt only a sudden swooping forward and a slow rise afterwards , without a jar . It seemed to her as if she rode in the bows of a boat , and the marshland were water , and now and then she lifted to a long low roller . There was no sound of wagon-moving . The wheels turned silently in their greased boxes , the balance of the great body prevented squeaks and rattles ; only occasionally the drill top shuddered slightly with a noise like shaking sails . The top was carried upon six birch hoops . Inside , when she looked back , the wagon was like a dusky cave with a small hole of light at the far end . It was piled with boxes and gave forth smells of loading , whether of this load or of earlier ones she could not say . The movement lulled her , and the baby slept as peacefully as if she were snugged in her cradle . The bells , so near , seemed to ring no louder than the bells of wagons she had heard in passage during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look down upon a floating whiteness level with her feet , in which the horses and the teamster moved like half-dreamed animals beneath the sea . Even the marsh grass was hidden . Now and then she made out groves of trees , lifting a darker grey in cut-out patterns . She saw them as floating shapes that drifted backward . There seemed to be twop259layers of the mist  --  the one upon the ground to hide the horses , and another , higher , resting on the tops of trees ; and she and the grey drill wagon-hood moved on a sacred level above the one and under the other . Plover were flying south . Their voices , slung back and forth high up , were filtered slowly down to mingle with the bells . She heard a flock of ducks break from a marsh pool , their nasal uproar shattering the mist and starting eddies , their shapes like bullets fired at the sun . The horses raised their heads and pricked small ears . Hunter looked up . " Mallards , " he said . His brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person on the verge of waking  --  that still moment when the senses are alive but the mind is lulled and only half perceives . And Hunter , glancing up at her from time to time , read her still face , and let her be ... . The horses strode at three miles to the hour . A steady pace , at first glance it seemed slow ; but they were bred to hold it , fourteen hours to the day , days on end . When the sun had cleared the mist , and the marshes lay open to view , the wagon had got past the Onondaga crossing and headed westward on the Geddes road . Cossett 's tavern lay behind them , a brown square shape , like a marsh growth in the grass . A barrack lifted its grey bark back a little way beyond it ; and Mary saw the men coming forth from the door , hiking their trousers after breakfast , and straggling down in twos and threes for the raw black furrow through the grass . Two teams with scoops were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mud while the handle-man bore down to lift the edge and then , on top of the embankment , heaved ; and the scoop turned over , leaving its dump , an oozing mound . She could see the furrow winding off northwesterly , deep in the still brown grass , and she smelled the stagnant water that crept out of the banks to puddle in it . But the road to Geddes went straight away west ; and in a little while the canal had disappeared and they were rolling up on higher ground and farm lands began to show their fences here and there , houses and log barns , like the Melvilles ' , cattle coming forth from milking , a boy slapping cow hocks with a strap , a barking dog , stilling suddenly to lift his leg against the gatepost , and a woman , who might have been herself , carrying two loaded buckets back across the yard . The sun shone warmly . The wet road showed its ruts in narrow , gleaming lakes ; but the earth smelled wholesome again . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cheeks . She raised her head and saw white clouds in a blue sky . The bells under her feet picked up a clearer tune and the horses shook their withers . Hunter caught up a pace on them so that he walked where he could look at her over his shoulder . He heard the baby snuffle and gasp . He laughed . " Comfortable ? " " Yes , thanks . " She opened the flap over the baby 's face and shifted the round head to lie under her breast . She smiled at Hunter . " It ' s more comfortable than any riding I have had . " He laughed again . " I seldom ever ride . It makes a man too tired , all day long . " He looked as if he could go on walking until his horses put their forefeet in the sea . " But it ' s an easy-riding wagon . " He seemed never to glance at his horses . Even when they met an oxcart with two children popping round eyes at them over the box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road , he merely said , " Gee , Edward , " quietly and watched the off front wheel . When it had touched the shoulder , " Up ! " he said , and the three teams straightened one by one . The oxcart had to look out for itself . A Pennsylvania team had right of way . It gave what it could , and if that was not enough the other vehicle must get into the ditch . There were no stages on this road . It was back-country  --  a few farms here and there just taking on establishment . Geddes , when they reached it , was no more than a hamlet , round a tiny store that bore a sign , POST OFFICE . . . .  |p261By  noon they had passed Camillus , a larger village with a small frame church and schoolhouse . Mary saw the children coming forth to eat their lunch , and the teacher , an oldish man in sober black , eating his bread and cheese upon the doorstep . Half a mile beyond the village the tolling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brassy noise , unmusical , yet it rang as if the master unloosed his pride in it . For their own lunch they stopped beside a moss-bedded brook as cold as ice . The horses came down in pairs to drink from it , careful with their forehoofs not to muddy it , dipping their muzzles to the eyes . Mary watched the gulps traveling up the arching throats . The horses lingered for an instant to let the water dribble from their nostrils , then turned back to the wagon , where Hunter had fastened their feed box to the rigid pole . They took their orderly stations before their own compartments . He stayed until all were eating . " That grey ' s kind of a thief , " he explained . " He do n't go actually for to steal , but to play a joke ; but when a horse is hauling , a joke like that comes heavy on him . " He made a small fire and sank in crotched sticks on either side of the flames , put another over them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought out collops of lean pork . " You ' 11 have one , Mrs. Fowler ? " " If you ' 11 share my pie and cheese . " " That ' s fine . " While he cooked the sizzling meat on pointed sticks , Mary undid her dress . She had already changed the baby 's cloths , rinsed the used in the spring , and spread them on a bush . But now a fly had waked the baby to a sense of famishment . It batted its hands against the breast and laid hold eagerly . And again , as she had felt in the beginning days , the wonder of her strength was waked in Mary and she bent far over the child . To-day it looked to her like Jerry . It ' s eyes , she thought , would not be grey like hers , but dark as his . A dark-eyed girl , she thought , with yellow hair . As the milk flowed , she straightened her back . Across the fire she met the teamster 's frank eyes . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , Mrs. Fowler . Can I now ? " Mary nodded . He came forward to bend down by the suckling baby . He touched its cheek with a tar-stained thumb . " Pretty , " he said softly . His thumb , in drawing off , just brushed the breast . But Mary was untouched by it ; her being was absorbed as it had always been , and Hunter 's brown face smiled as he returned to his fire . The baby fell asleep when it had finished , and they ate together side by side upon a log . They did not talk , but when they were done Hunter lighted a cigar and puffed awhile , and then rose up and hitched his team . He helped Mary to her seat and handed up the baby . He took a last look at the spring . " If some teamsters had seen me there with linens all spread out they would have laughed . " But Mary did not hear . Her eyes were for the road beyond the leaders ' ears . " Will we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . I 'm hauling in to Montezuma . If he ' s working still at Jordan , likely not . We go on to Brutus before we turn north . " She scarcely was aware of the start , the wagon rolled so smoothly . They passed through miles of woodland , sweet with balsam , where she saw rabbits under ferns . Hunter pointed out a partridge eating berries , but before she saw it the bird had thundered off into the trees . Elbridge , a little village , met them in the woods , and then at a little after three they came to Brutus . Here the westward road ended in a tavern against which a horse-shed leaned , and they turned north away from the Auburn road . They now traveled in the thickest woods that Mary had ever seen . The branches bent down to scrape the wagon-hood , and the box swayed and pitched over corduroy . The bells were a muffled , close sound which she could almost touch . Without warning they rolled out in a clearing . The road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin stood . Burnt land showed stumps and the charred bodies of trees . A man and woman werep263working , between them dragging a hand brush-harrow over lumpy ground . And inexplicably the raw ditch of the half-dug canal stretched out of the trees from the right and went away to west beside a raw new road . Hunter stopped the team and walked across to the young couple . " Hello , " he said . The man took in the whip and the great wagon and the panting team . His eyes hardened ; and the woman drew close to his side . " Hello , " he said . Hunter smiled friendlily , but the man 's eyes were unchanged . " You ai n't seen a man named Fowler round about here ? " " Fowler ? " asked the man , stiffly . He turned to the woman . Labor had hollowed her oval face . She spoke in an edged voice . " He ' s the one that left the letter ? " " Maybe him . I disremember names . These diggers are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked at Hunter , then slowly to the wagon . Both he and his woman then saw Mary . " Is it her expects a letter ? " " It might be her or me . " " He left a letter for his wife . " " Suppose you let us see it . " " How ' 11 we know ? A letter ai n't a thing for everybody , " saidthe man . The woman added , " I have got it hid . You ca n't have it . " It might have been their meagre stock of coins they talked about . Hunter said , " You could let me read it . If it ' s not for us we ' 11hand it back . " The two looked at each other . " Maybe that ' s so , " said the man . " Fetch it , Anna . " The woman tiredly entered the house . The man followed her . He came forth with a rifle in his hand . Then the woman brought a folded square of paper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It ' s for you , Mrs. Fowler . " He made to hand it up to Mary.  | " I wo n't let you hand it up , " the man said suddenly . Mary 's heart had fallen . " Read it there . I do n't want to get down , disturbing the baby . " " You ' ve a baby ? " demanded the woman . " Yes . " " He said the woman had a baby  --  was his wife . George , you recollect . " The man nodded . " Could I see the baby ? " Dully , Mary opened the blanket flap . The sight of the small red face comforted her . But the woman had sprung up on the eveners and was peering in with avid eyes . Suddenly the eyes filled , and she whispered up to Mary proudly , " I ' m expecting my own self . In February . " Mary looked round the small clearing . She thought of the woods road and snow . " I ' m glad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I guess it ' s all right , George , " she said over her shoulder . Hunter was reading the letter . He said , " Jerry ' s sorry he ca n't come to meet you . He ' s hired you a little house in Montezuma , belonging to a Mrs. Peck . It ' s ready for you . There ' s firewood and she has got in edibles . He ' s coming down next week . " The woman smiled at Mary . " A hired house , " she said ; but Mary thought , " He would n't come to meet us . Yes . A hired house . " Port Byron stood in fields . And from Port Byron the broad wheels rolled on a better road . The horses tossed their bits as if their collars had been cured of pain . At sunset they saw a town below them . Beyond , a river gleamed in a meandering channel , making islands . A great marsh was spread out , as far as the eye could see . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grey water . Mary had never seen such grass ; it rose , out of water , ten feet high . The village street followed the higher bank of the river . There were buildings on each side . A tannery ran a long shed beside the road and gave out green hide smells . A church had a small squarep265tower . There was a tavern with a yard , and a man brushing down a sweated horse . Across the river , two long barracks stood on little hillocks , and in the sunset sheen men were digging to their waists in muck . A boat coming across the river carried three men wrapped in blankets . As Hunter 's wagon passed the landing , one of the two rowers jumped out and made fast to the planks . He looked at Hunter , spat into the water , said , " Just three more fevers . " " Much of it ? " Hunter asked . " Not much now . They had three hundred sick last August . " The wagon rolled down the street . Hunter asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The man pointed a thumb . " That frame house at the end of the street . A widow-woman . Her husband owned the tannery ; she ' s rich . That house  --  with the first cabin back of it . " Mary followed the thumb 's pointing . The man was staring up at her . But she did not look at him . She saw the cabin . It was lifeless . Hunter wheeled the team round the frame house . A weedy garden patch was back of it . He helped Mary down at the cabin door , and carried in her bundles for her . He said , " I ' 11 light you a fire before I go on . " There was wood behind , which he brought in . He started a roaring blaze . The cabin was dank with mould . The baby cried . A voice said , " What are you doing in my house ? " A shawled , bent , hook-nosed woman leaned on a stick in the door . " This is Mrs. Fowler , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood a moment eyeing Mary with sharp grey eyes . Her hooked nose seemed to draw down as if she smelled the whiskey on her lips . " I hope you ' re comfortable , Mrs. Fowler . " She turned herself slowly round . " I wo n't drop in until you ' re settled . " Hunter said , " Is there a well ? " " A good one , " said the woman . " In the garden . "  | She went off . Hunter drew a bucket for Mary and then went out to his team . " I ' 11 stop in before I leave to-morrow , " he said . Then he smiled at her weary face . " It wo n't look so bad in the morning . All it needs is the fire . Log walls dry fast . " Mary thanked him , watched him go . Then she looked around the cabin . It had glass windows , two of them . There was a bed in the corner , but the blankets hung from the rafters were dampsmelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . There were two splint-seated chairs beside the table and a few dishes on a shelf . A chest held flour and bacon and some eggs , butter , and a jar of milk . Mary looked down at them . Then the baby cried , again . She turned , picked it up , drew a chair to the fire , and sat down . She opened her dress , and , feeding the baby , comforted herself . But her eyes kept wandering . She thought again , " A hired house . "  | " Spit on your hands and dig " INDEPENDENCEVILLEON a Sunday morning , the Mayor came walking down the main street of the city . He wore an old three-cornered hat upon his head ; the black rolled felt shone dimly green . His old blue army coat with the buff facings had been brushed threadbare ; and his buff waistcoatshowed no single spot , " because , " as the Mayor would tell a person , " for thirty year I 've took it off to eat my Sunday dinner . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pants stuffed into cowhide boots . " A-i . " Mayor Barley leaned upon his stick to contemplate the shoes . " A new cobbler made them for me back in March . He bought out Willie Bender 's circuit here . A man I would n't notion towards for a citizen to live into my city , but handy as a cobbler . Name of Harley Falk , he drives a blind white horse . " " I ' ve heard of him , " said Jerry . " He made my wife a pair of shoes . " " You 're married , are you , boy ? " " Yes . " " Look here ! " The Mayor turned on him . His little sky-blue eyes swam sentimentally . " Why do n't you bring the Missus here and settle ? Here 's the rising city of the west . I tell you what . I 've took a notion to you . And the copriation will make out a lot to you for nothing . just toss your eye around , boy , and see where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Main Street where we stand , with Steuben Alley running into it . ( I give Steuben an alley for remembrance of his everlasting present arms . ) Now here ,  |p268real  handy , is the public market . Look over there  --  what do you see ? " Jerry looked . He saw a dead skunk cabbage beside an aphised alder clump . " A handsome site . That ' s the Constitution Opera House . A handsome building . Across the way is the Washington Hotel , or Lafayette Bar , I disremember . The lettering ' s wore off . " Jerry walked over to a painted signboard tilted halfway over . " It ' s got the mark of a P , and there ' s an R a little way along . " " God damn ! " Mayor Barley struck his stick deep into the mud . " Elkanah ' s got them mixed again . The idea of a livery stable setting in amongst an oprey house ! Paul Revere Livery . No sir  --  it ' s the bar . I ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you ' re minded , as you say , to build you boats on this canal , I 'll let you have a yard on the main basin . Elkanah ' s digging of it in the spring . I had to make him alderman to do it . He ' s the common council now for putting up these buildings , besides being swamper in my bar . " The sun glanced brilliantly on his red nose . " Ai n't it handy ? " he demanded , proudly . " It ' s a handsome layout , " Jerry said . " I take it I 've been kind of cute in naming of the streets . I ' ve got it close to near completion , only for the schoolhouse . And I 've got a bell to put in that . " " I do n't believe I ' 11 settle down just yet , " said Jerry . " Well , it makes me sorry . But I 'm glad to have you living in my bar . It ' s going to do me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By dog it ! I 've set on my porch and watched those poor bezabors heeling down in muck and getting nowhere . All the while they get the fever . Even whiskey do n't do any good . You ' 11 mark I laid this town out on high ground . I 've lived here twenty year and never had a touch of ague . Yes sir ! " He touched Jerry 's elbow with his stick . " Let ' s just turn in to Clintonia Street , right here . It takes up by the town hall into the park where Linas Barley 's is . A goodIp269place for a drink ! " The Mayor stuck in a word of advertisement for his tavern . " Good liquor and a bug-free bed to follow . " They walked along over the hummocky ground marked off with myriad signboards . The streets had no relation to pedestrian comforts . They clambered over logs or circled tamarack trees and crossed a sluggish creek on one frail board . " Some day I ' 11 trace that crick back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from salt or maybe coal , I ai n't made up my mind . " They circled the park , where an aged cow was brooding over clover dreams and chewing a cud of buffalo grass , and came out of the sparse woodland on the edge of the marshes . There a large log house , of two full stories with a lean-to kitchen in the back and a porch on cedar piles in front , faced eastward . The air was clear of haze . Jerry could see as far as Montezuma , nine miles off . The marsh grass was a maze of grey netted with blue , meandering threads , and through the middle of it , straight away , ran the line of the canal . It showed not as a ditch but as a ribbon of roiled water . There were no diggers on a Sunday , but the eye could sight the thin lines of stone laid down on either side , waiting for puddling . " You 've tackled a hard job to lay foundation for that lock . One contractor has gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dancer Borden bought him out . But he wo n't never muddy his Russian boots in any mud . He told me just the other day he ' d found a man to make it  --  meaning you , I ' ve got no doubt . " He stamped up the porch and into the tap . Jerry followed . At the table sat his helpers , Plute Sowersby and Cosmo Turbe . Plute grinned to see him . " Do we get a driver for the piles , Mr. Fowler ? " " We ' 11 need one , " Jerry said . " Cosmo has been hankering to put his hand on one of them contraptions . " The little frog-mouthed man grinned blandly . He poised his hand above a sugar-colicked fly that lay kicking just in front of him . His left hand made a motion of cranking and the right hand was raisedp270slowly . Then he knocked an imaginary paul and the right hand came down like lead . Plute shuddered ostentatiously . Cosmo Turbe turned his hand over . Underneath , the fly still kicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinned and whistled in his teeth . Slowly he cranked up his hammer . Once more the palm came down . When Plute looked back , there was no fly . " Now what you gone and done to it ? " demanded Plute . Cosmo put his eye level with the table and ostentatiously blew some dust . Linas Barley was taking off his coat and waistcoat . He hung them on a peg , came forward to a chair beside the iron stove , and sat down comfortably . He had a pipe in his hand and tobacco in a brass box . The sunlight , shining on his shoulder , touched his leathery old cheek . " Yes sir , " he said , " she ' s quite a city . " Plute looked at him under his shaggy brows . " Me and Cosmo has been looking at the map of it . " He pointed with his thumb at the wall behind him . " It ' s going to be a handsomeplace , Mr. Barley . But ai n't there going to be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out little puffs . " I did n't bother to set them down , " he said . " I figgered they ' d just come themselves . They always do . " Jerry went to his small sleeping room . The tavern was strangely clean . Upstairs the walls were papered with old news-print . The window of his room had colored paper curtains  --  blue and orange ; they crackled faintly in the breeze . His bundle lay on the foot of the bed , ready for unpacking . With one ear alert for the dinner bell , he set to work to put away his things . Below , he could hear Linas Barley holding forth to Cosmo Turbe . " I got these lands by the Pension Law of ' 83 . They was n't good for farming , so I just settled down here and built me a bar . The Durham boaters come in sometimes . And lately I got word of this canal . Right then I got my notion for a city . There she is . " The dinner bell clanged brassily. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he come with me . Now I ' ve got me a black woman for a cook and things are comfortableand the diggers make me trade . I 've sent in copriation papers into Albany , but they do n't answer . Not that it makes a lot of difference . If a man intends to have the finest city of the westward land , who ' s got the right to stop him ? " They ate at the long table along the taproom wall . Elkanah Kew was a cadaverous image built of skin and bone . His eyes were bleary and his nose bothered him in breathing . " Elkanah ai n't got much enthusiasm for this canal . He do n't exactly fancy digging out the basin , do you , hey ? " Kew did not raise his head . " Wait till you get stuck , waist-down in that-there muck , " he said to Cosmo . " Hell ! A little wart like you will be chin-deep . " Cosmo rolled his eyes . An ample black woman wearing a bright green kerchief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stabbed in heavy mouthfuls . A bone in his jaw kept knocking as he chewed . His monotonous words came round the food . " Last summer half the gangs was sick with fever . Every time they shoveled out the muck , some more ran in . There ' s niggers working now , and they get sick with colds . " " It ' s a fact , " said Barley soberly . " They 've dug a year at it and only got a mile to show . The muck , it wets right in . " DANCER BORDENMr . Dancer Borden 's residence overlooked the marshes from the south shore of Mud Creek in the southwest corner of the town of Galen . It was a white frame building , handsomely fronted with pilasters that merged into arches over the second-story windows . A grove of young elms gave it delicate shade . Mr. Borden lived alone . He had a dozen negroes on the place to work his orchards and tend his blooded cattle ; but no sight of them was visible from the house itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kennels were all concealed by skillful hemlock planting . " Mistuh Bo'den is expecting of you , suh . " The sly-eyed , slim mulatto girl gave Jerry a knowing glance . She seemed to giggle underneath her skin to see his sturdy shoes slicked up with grease , his homespun coat that wrinkled on the shoulders ; even his freshly laundered flannel shirt amused her . She left him in a drawing-room whose windows overlooked the slope down to the creek . The sun was setting westward . A mile away Jerry could see Linas Barley 's tavern and the site of Independenceville . In the marsh itself the black-gnat specks of negroes waded in the muck . On the very edge of the marsh he saw the site of the lock and the web-like beams of the pile driver waiting to be hauled away . The river gleamed with a steady change of sunset color . Far away towards Montezuma , an active pile driver was thudding piles to hold the causeway towpath . But the windows revealed these things as interesting pictures that a man could put out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A flowered carpet made comfortable the floor , and silken-covered chairs invited elegant meditation . There were small tables of foreign makes ; one , carved in dull black wood , attracted Jerry . Some day , perhaps , when he had his own house , he would buy such a table . " How are you , Fowler ? " In the door stood Dancer Borden ; an indolent , slim figure , ovalfaced , with black , possessive eyes . He held his hand out . " Evening , Mr. Borden . " Jerry was conscious of the hat held in his hand . Mr. Borden made a tiny gesture , and the mulatto servant stole in and gently removed it to the hall . She passed her master with a demure bending of her head ; and he ignored her . " Dinner , " he said , " is waiting . " A pointed finger-tip on Jerry 's elbow guided him along the hall ; his thick-soled boots raised clatters from the tiling . The diningp273room was walled with a French paper on which pink shepherdesses disported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggesting , in its slimness , the elegance of the master of the house . He seated Jerry on his right and took his own place . He left his napkin folded on his knees . There was an odor in this house that puzzled Jerry , a fine perfume he thought might come from antique wood . He had smelled nothing like it in his life . It made it hard for him to speak ; and he was glad that there was only Dancer Borden to confront him . They ate a creamy pinkish soup  --  tomatoes ; then fish , broiled collops of a western sturgeon , liberally sauced with a flavor Jerry was unable to identify ; then quail , split upon a kind of toast , with a glass of wine ; and wine again to go with the roast of lamb ; and another wine to follow venison ; and then a strange fluffy dish on which Dancer Borden sent out his compliments to the kitchen . He called it a souffle . Always , after that evening , Jerry would think of Dancer Borden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluff between one 's teeth , and had a virile taste of foreign cheese . It grew upon one after it was gone . Two new maids waited on them , both mulattoes , in caps and dark brown dresses . They moved silently , with trained , averted eyes . In all the houses Jerry had eaten in the waiting girl sat down at table , but these two were like shadows , of which he only seemed aware . Borden talked with charm . There was no unmanly posture in his speech . He talked about his hounds . He hunted deer with them , on horseback , like a western gentleman . One carried a rifle and followed the hound 's voice as close as the horse could take one through the woods , striving to head off the deer at a clearing . It made for chancy shooting . He asked Jerry 's advice on boring worms in apple trees , and Jerry spoke of the potash ring they used in Uniontown , and Borden made a little note of that in a little book with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone into his library , a maid brought brandy in a small glass bottle . Borden explained that it was old French his father had brought back from Quebec , when he was ap274prisoner there ( " Seigneur 's Brandy " ) . And only then did he ask about the progress on the lock . " My job ' s done except for the gates , " Jerry said . " Your mason ' s putting in the tiers . " " That ' s fine . I knew when I laid eyes on you that you would do the trick . " " I ' ve had experience by now . " The firelight beat on the still , pale face of Dancer Borden like small hands . His profile , turned to Jerry , offered clear-cut lines . His dark eyes had grown velvety , woman-like , Jerry thought . Though here was no woman-like creature ; but a man who could mark his buck at forty paces from a galloping horse . The brandy grew in Jerry , blossomed inward , and turned his thoughts from digging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still and cool and clean on the neat lawn , he looked back to Montezuma . Mary would be in her cabin . She seemed happier now . It was a counterfeit of the small home she hungered after . She would have put the baby to bed by this time , and would be spinning , maybe , or sewing at his worn-out clothes , or making herself a dress out of the stuff they had bought together at the store . This summer she had worked a little garden patch . She had had daffodils in spring , and planted rhubarb . She moved about her daily round with a placidity that sometimes Jerry longed to break , but could not move against . And all at once he tried to think why this strange gentleman had invited him to dinner ; for he had caught some of the same restlessness , half reckless , and half bitter , like a distillation from all these beautiful luxuries . But when Jerry looked up to meet the dark , cool eyes , Dancer Borden laughed . " Go lightly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , see , and have . But do go lightly . " " I was thinking , " Dancer Borden said , " that we 've been digging through that swamp for twenty months . And there has n't been any real progress . One Galen and three Mentz contractors have been broken by it . What was done was done in winter . It ' s not the men 's fault . They ' re pretty faithful , but the fever weakens them.  |p275Poor  devils . " He laughed lightly . " I suppose I ' m a fool , but I 've taken up the contracts . " Jerry stared . " I see you agree , Fowler . But you know the marsh involves just one thing . That ' s human toughness . Now they 've tried our local peasantry that ought to be inured to ague and the intermittent fever . They went down south for Pennsylvania Dutch , strong shovelers , but the fever pole-axed them . Just about every race under the sun was tried except the yellow men from China  --  where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way . Then I got interested . My own niggers have kept healthy . So I sent down into Virginia for a hundred negroes . I bought them . When they got up here I set them free under the recent act , but put them under contract to work for me two years . They still work like slaves under that big buck , Jay-Jay . You ' ve seen him . The fellow with the earrings . But they ' re chilled ; they ca n't stand that wet muck . It seeps right through their black hides . " He made a little gesture with his hand . " Two months ago when I was in Albany I fell to talking with a sailing master . I put the problem up to him . And he said right away there was one race to dig it  --  the Irish bog-trotters . I commissioned him to get a shipload of them . They ought to land at Hudson before long . We ' 11 have them here next month . " Jerry said nothing . He wondered vaguely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no interest . The brandy blurred his senses , and Dancer Borden 's face hung like a medallion beyond his mazy stream of thought ... . ROUGH-AND-TUMBLE " She ' s done , " said Plute . Nodding his head , Cosmo Turbe swung a gate back and forth . Jerry looked out over the marsh . Work was where it had been , for all that an eye could see . The cook came forth from the first barrack to clang his gong for supper . The three lock builders gathered their tools.  | " Cosmo , " said Plute , " she ' s done , and me , I 'm going to get drunk . " The little man examined his partner , with popping eyes . " How about it , Cosmo ? How do you feel ? " " Real active , Plute . " They trudged together up the hill , along the Canal Boulevard of Linas Barley 's Independenceville . Jerry remained to pack his chest . He heard the dinner bell ringing in the tavern . A fine rain was sifting through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour later , he saw a group on the tavern porch . Old Linas Barley in his tricorn hat stood right between two men , like a master at a ceremonial . The others were mostly strange to Jerry . Another gang , he supposed , to try their luck with fever . Or else they had come from the marsh , it being Saturday . As he drew closer he supposed they had come from the marshes . Their eyes were angry , their faces tightly drawn . Then he saw that one of the two men between whom Linas Barley stood was Cosmo Turbe . His squat figure was quite still . He looked like a man ready to sleep . Only his eyes were staring at the other . " What 's doing ? " Jerry asked . " That timber-beast squashed Henry , " said Plute . " What for ? " " He beat his own bug in a race . " Cosmo had a cockroach that he used to race against all comers ; or if there was no racing competition , the bug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry . Plute took Jerry 's arm . " You can see him if you are a-mind to , in the bar . " Jerry stared at the other man . He stood close to six feet . In front of him , Cosmo was a little boy . The man 's eyes glittered . He had put his week 's pay in a lump on his own bug ; he had no drinking money left . " Stand back , Mr. Fowler , " Linas Barley said . He addressed the two men . " It ' s rough-and-tumble to a finish , open all . I introduce you Cesmo Turbe , the runtish man , and Noble Eddy out of Pompey . "  | " Wait , " said Jerry . Plute whispered , " Leave him be . Cosmo is an active man . " Hung from the doorpost a lantern threw a gleam out against the sifting rain . The eaves were dripping slow big drops . The faces of the two men stood out like masks . And as Barley stepped back , and said confidentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrassel in nine years , " Jerry saw Cosmo 's flat mouth grin and his long tongue lip his mouth . The other men were breathing hoarsely . Marsh digging rougheneda man 's breath . Then all at once the big man moved ; and Cosmo ducked ; and the porch shook under their feet . They slid in and out so quickly that in the dim light Jerry 's eyes were dazed . He heard a blur of voices , " A French lip . . . . Gouge him . . . . There ' s a Buffalo-roll , by God . . . the little feller 's neat . . . . Four shillings to a fip on Noble . . . a butt . . . I ' 11 cover them four shilling . " The last was Plute 's voice , confident , ready to laugh . Jerry could see no mark on either man ; but their boots stamped ; the porch shook as one fell to dodge a groin kick . . . . Then , as quickly as it had begun , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noble 's nose , to catch the nostrils with hooked fingers . He rolled over the other 's upthrust knee , and kept on rolling over the boards . Noble pounced with a hoarse roar . But as he would have landed , Cosmo seemed to rise on his stiff elbows , head and shoulders on the floor , and his heels flashed their nails in the lantern , and Noble Eddy crumpled like a rotten stick . He lay still on his face , his hands under it , making no sound . Cosmo got up and turned him over . Blood was oozing through Noble 's fingers , but Cosmo took his hand away . One boot had caught the mouth , opening the lips raggedly . In the misplaced bloody hole , Jerry saw a yellowish tooth . The other heel had sunk into the cheek . Cosmo touched the marking with his fingers . A star with a jagged line . He shrugged his shoulders . Jerry felt sick . He went inside , He heard Plute collecting his four shillings . " Champion of the trace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Jerry ordered a glass of Devereux whiskey . As he sat down at table with it the men came trooping in . They were silent , sulleneyed , and they did not look at Cosmo . On the table was a squashed brown cockroach . IRONDEQUOTBates was a matter-of-fact sort of man . " Fowler , Mr. Bouck . " The commissioner shook hands with Jerry . They sat down together on the steps of Linas Barley 's porch . Bates , the assistant engineer , opened the conversation . " Mr. Bouck and I 've been out along the line to Rochester . Most of the way the digging will look easy when we get this marsh done . " Mr. Bouck nodded . " It looks pretty hopeless . If there was some way to drain them . " " Well , it ' s Dancer Borden 's worry . " " He does n't care . He ' s got money to spend , as much as he wants . It ' s a game to him . " " That ' s it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposition , and he ' 11 finish it . " " Well , maybe . But here it is in late September . Back at Rome they ' 11 soon let Mohawk water into the Utica section . Next spring boats will be moving out to Montezuma . But here we have n't a thing to show yet . Digging all the way to Erie wo n't help things if we ca n't dig out across that marsh . We 've got the stones laid for the trunk , but if we ca n't empty out the muck and puddle it with clay , next high water will wash in what little we have dug . It did before . " " Leave it to Borden , " Bates said . " What we wanted , Fowler , is to see you about Irondequot . Do you know that place ? " " No . " " Out there Irondequot Brook cuts through the Rochester level . There ' s high land on each side . We ca n't lock down to the creek because there is n't water to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to open a straight flow for Erie water to these marshes . See it ? " Jerry nodded . " How deep is the creek under level ? " " Eighty feet , " said Mr. Bouck . " There ' s just one place to get across , " said Bates . " Geddes found it on his first survey in 1809 . The creek loops a small round hill there , then there ' s another cut it must have dug in Indian times , but dry now . That ' s easy to fill . We 've got to trunk across the top of that round hill , and luckily its top is wide enough . But the creek crossing is another pullet . What do you think ? Could you make an aqueduct of wood that high ? " " How long ? " " Five hundred feet . " " There ' s too much weight of water , " Jerry said . " Geddes thought so , " said Mr. Bouck . " I think so myself and so does Bates . But back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money we 've been spending . Every time a thing crops up they tell us to try it in wood . " " If we make an earth embankment , " Bates said , " we 'll need a culvert for the creek . What we want to know is whether you 'll be free next spring . " " I guess so . " " Will you hire on to the state to build that culvert floor ? We do n't dare contract it out . It ' s too ticklish . One waving pile would start the whole embankment washing . " " What does the state pay ? " " What do you get from Dancer Borden ? " " A hundred shillings flat a week . " " Will you take that for this job ? " " Yes . " WILD IRISHEdwin Brown had cooked the breakfast for the new gang . In the main room he heard them stirring in their bunks . O'Mory , the boss , with his thick black beard stuffed inside his shirt to drink his tea ,  | was asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . But Edwin Brown was not worrying . This morning marked an era . It seemed to him that , like the wandering Jew , his life moved under a curse . He had tried every lottery available in these two years , but never yet had he found the lucky number . And here he was stuck down at his old job , in a marsh ten times as big as any he had worked in yet . He hated the cold , he hated the getting up on a morning to cook for heavy-smelling men . And he had come into a fever-ridden shanty , just in time to see a weary gang go out and these new brown horrible outlandish men come in with their jabber of strange talk . Gaelic , the big boss said it was ; himself was New York Irish . But this morning things looked better to Edwin Brown . For in the interval between the old gang 's going out and the coming in of these queer creatures with their lathelike arms and legs he had providedhimself with a winter comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been given by Mr. Fowler , he had constructed himself a privy . He had laid it up himself . Three by five , and six feet high , it had a sloping roof . As he surveyed it yesterday evening , he thought that he had seldom seen a better-constructed piece of work . The fit of the door was just as good as any carpenter could have made it . The inside walls were papered to keep out the wind . It would be cold , of course , in winter , but the wind was what he had minded most these two years past . Luxuriously he emptied the last drop of tea from his own cup . In the main room , the men were talking softly . Now and then he caught an English word , ignorantly mispronounced , as one or other of the men attempted conversation with the boss . He supposed he ought to take a look at them to see if crazy Tom had done his job , but he was n't going to spoil the gentle ecstasy of this initial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to his feet and took his stiff hat from its peg . He rolled his sleeves down and took off his apron . Then he worked his arms into his coat . He moved softly to the door . But just there he remembered something . He returned to the sink and got the latest newspaper . It had the lottery drawings which he had read in misery two days ago . A little smile spread his small mouth . He put the paper in his pocket and stepped out . It was a misty morning . Down the line for the river , the driver , piling on the causeway , had begun its work . The thuds came to him in a kind of muffled drum-beat for a fine slow march . Edwin Brown followed the path through the wet , silvered muck . He saw the structure sitting there with a sublime aloofness . It was as he had left it , door closed , the latchstring hanging forth . That , he considered , had been his consummating inspiration . A privy with an actual latch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all the pride of real achievement . Then , smiling half modestly , half bashfully , he pulled the string , opened the door , and stepped inside . For a moment the scene was one of utter quietude . The marsh mist lifted silently to the sun 's drinking . The morning was brought in with peacefulness . Then , in the thinning mists , some shapes began to move . They were men , walking in bare feet , single file behind their leader . The damp was pearled in his black beard . His shirt was open to the waist , showing his bright red undershirt . " Hogan . " His voice whispered incredibly soft and hoarse , but a little batearedfellow with jouncy steps moved up beside him , and cocked his face to get his orders . " Yis ? " " Ye 've got the hammer and the big spike wid ye ? " " Yis , O'Mory . " " Then it ' s you for nailing the door . " Hogan grinned . As he began stealing for the door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen-foot poles . " As soon as Hogan dhrives his spike , you bhoys rush up and belabor on thim two-by-fowers. "  | He moved with them cautiously . The latchstring was drawn in . From the inside of the privy no sound came , and outside the Irish crept with an unholy stealth . Suddenly Hogan 's hammer banged . It banged again  --  the sound of a heavy spike being rammed in . And then as the mist swirled under the sun , the marsh was made alive with shrieking . A dozen men nailed on the two-by-fours . Along behind them came the stamp of running feet . They screamed with laughter , but the privy remained as still as death . O'Mory roared above them all . His teeth glistened like porcelain through the black hairs of his beard . " Lift it up , me bhoys . It ' s in an unconvaniant place . Just bring it round until I ' ve found it out a dacent spot . " A dozen men put shoulders under the bars . The privy swung aloft . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a darkfacedboy named Peter started singing . He sang in Gaelic , a hero 's song , how his most faithful soldiers carried him to his bier . The others caught the tune . Their faces lighted with a kind of melancholy joy . Their feet moved into time , and like a palanquin of a queen they bore the privy towards the shanty . The other shanties had been built on reasonably dry ground farther along the marsh . Singing still , they started down the berm . Half of them went before and half followed after . From the peg over his bunk O'Mory had brought forth the fire helmet he had worn to fires with his company back in New York . Bright red , its varnish sparkled in the rising sun . He marched before the palanquin with the strut of a queen 's bed-master . A quarter of a mile they bore it down , and at each shanty other Irishmen lit up their eyes and joined them till they had a hundred strong . And they all sang . They turned about , and slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Linas Barley in his tricorn hat first heard them . He called for Jerry . Bates and Jerry caught the wild swirling of voices . The singing was like nothing human they had heard . Without music , it hadp283music in its heart ; it had no beauty , but it was sad with a desire . They forgot , in hearing it , the letter from Utica that Bates had just begun to read , and they came out with Linas and looked down on the brown procession winding serpentwise along the berm . O'Mory came marching up to them . He stopped beside the wall of the finished lock . He spied there two eighteen-foot planks left over from the gate planks . He lifted them up alone and cast them over the well . Then , motioning his men , he had them inch the privy out so that it stood in the middle of the lock , ten feet over the bottom flooring , with the door flush with the outside edge of the front plank . He raised his hand for silence . " Here ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden hush of those wild men , a frantic hammering sounded from inside the privy . O'Mory 's jaw fell open . " God deliver me , there ' s someone in it ! " " Hey ! " came the muffled voice . " Hey ! Hey ! Let me out . " " Oh God , " wailed the jouncy little Hogan  --  " I think it ' s Mister Brown . " " Why did n't annybody tell me he was in it ? " roared O'Mory . Every face was hangdog . " Do n't stand shtupiding ! Let the poor man out ! You , Hogan , you ' re handy with a hammer . " The little jouncy man jumped on a plank . He reached around the corner with his hammer and clawed forth the spike . The iron squeaked through the wood . And Jerry and Bates , with laughter grasping them , managed to look soberly at the door . An instant there was silence . The door swung wide , and in the privy they saw Edwin Brown , doing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step and then shrank back . The faces of the Irish were very sad . They looked embarrassed . And then O'Mory said , " We beg yer pardon , Misther Brown . We did n't know it was a private privy . The bhoys is very sorry . Shall we carry you back ? " Edwin Brown had his great moment then.  | " No thanks , O'Mory . I think I 'll walk . It ' s time I had mymorning constitutional . " They carried off the privy . Handsomely , Edwin Brown stepped out . Without a word he started walking back to the shanty , and behind him half a dozen men , like naughty children , bore his privy for him . " Wait a minute , O'Mory , " Bates said . " It ' s pretty funny in a way . But it ' s time you had your gang at work . " " We did n't intend no harm , sor . We would n't never have done it if we ' d known that Misther Brown was in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voice was sober as the Irishman 's . " But this is n't play you boys have tackled . I 've just had a letter thatI want to read you . It will show you that this is a great thing that you ' re working at . " He fished the letter from his pocket . " This canal , " he said , " used to be a dream of a few men . But now there ' s water in it . It ' s up to you to carry it west through this marsh . " He opened the letter . " It ' s from a gentleman I know in Utica . He says he thinks I ' d like a comment not official . This is what he writes :  --  " On Friday afternoon I walked to the head of the grand canal , the eastern extremity of which now reaches within a very short distance of this village , and from one of the airy bridges which crossed it I had a sight that could not but elevate and exhilarate the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming down their untried channel to the sea . Their course , owing to the absorption of the new banks of the canal and the distance they had to run from where the stream entered it , was much slower than I had anticipated . It was dark before they reached the eastern extremity , but at sunrise next morning they were on a level two and a half feet deep throughout the whole distance of thirteen miles . The interest manifested by the whole country , as this new internal river rolled its first wave through the state , can not be described . You might see the people running across the fields , climbingon trees and fences , and crowding the bank of the canal to gaze upon the welcome sight . A boat had been prepared at Rome , as you probably knew , and as the waters came down the canal you might mark their progress by that of this new Argo which floated triumphantly along the " SPIT ON YOUR HANDS AND DIG " 285p285Hellespont of the West , accompanied by shouts and having on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bells began a merry peal , and the commissioners , in carriages , proceeded from Bagg 's Hotel to the landing . " Mr. Bates looked up from his reading . He saw the clustered faces watching his lips with a polite absence of expression . His voice faltered . He had moved himself tremendously , but all at once he remembered that these men spoke very little English . " O'Mory , " he said . " Yes sor . " " You might explain it to them . " " Yes sor . " O'Mory turned on his men . His black beard bristled as he drew a mighty breath . He roared in Gaelic : " The gent ' s been reading at you unlearned devils , from a letter from the governor ginral of this-here nation . He says in it for me to paste the first wan of you that disobeys me ordhers . Ye see that stretch of bogland ? Well , he wants it dhug by spring . It ' s wet in there , me bhoys .

" Jerry was sitting beside the hearth of the small cabin . It had be . come a comfortable place under Mary 's hand . The curtains at the window were a warm red woolen , heavy enough to shut out dark ness . She had made closets with soft yellow cloth , and a quilt of dyed yellow for the bed . She liked the warmer , softer colors . I was a wonder to Jerry how she had made this cabin over , stamping it with herself . Mary looked up quietly from the dough her hands were kneading Flour had dusted her wrists . Her sleeves had been tucked up an ( she was kneeling on the hearth . Her quiet eyes turned back into the room where the child sat banging the head of her wooden dol upon the floor . " I do n't know , Jerry . I keep thinking she takes after you . " " Not with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She ' s got the same-shaped head . " " Maybe . " He did n't really care about it . It was talk . His eyes were fo his wife . When he came into the cabin and smelled the sweet , fre smell she brought into the place , his mind was carried back in evitably to that morning on the Albany docks , the sunlight and th river , and the taut snapping of pigeons ' wings . He had paid fo her papers , owning her ; and yet , since he had married her , he hay never felt that she was actually his . He had been home for three days . April was nearly over . was time that he moved on to Irondequot . They were going t tackle it at last . Bates had gone out two days ago . He had to tell her that now . He said , " Those Irishmen have surely dug a great strip out of the marsh . " Mary said , " They ' re wild-appearing men . The people here are frightened every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " They have n't done any actual harm , have they ? " " No . They fight amongst themselves . But they do n't look bad to me  --  just strange , and I like to hear them singing . Polly was in the garden patch the other day . I ' d left her on a blanket in the sun . One of them picked her up and took her down to the tap , and I did n't miss her until three of them brought her back again . She was laughing fit for all and pulling at the big one 's beard . " " O'Mory , " Jerry said . " Maybe it was . There was a little man with pointed ears beside him and a boy with dark and sad-appearing eyes . " " Jouncy Hogan . " " They were all three drunk , but real polite . They took their hats off and went off on tiptoe . I do n't know why they went off on tiptoe . Perhaps not to frighten us . " Mary smiled . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beating-out of time . The baby made a funny little crooning sound . Then she laid the doll down and spat on it carefully . " What does she do that for ?

She ' s quite a stranger to you , Jerry . Is n't she ? " Jerry checked himself from looking at Mary . After a moment she said , " I ' m getting that way , too . Ai n't I ? " " What do you say that for ? " His voice had become brittle . " It ' s true , is n't it ? " He thought , " It ' s true . It ' s not my fault . She does n't see I havep291to work . It ' s she ' s grown different . " He did not answer out loud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't look pretty to my eyes , I must say . " " Maybe it does n't . " " Where ' d you get it ? You did n't carve it out yourself ? " Mary shaped the loaf and carefully tucked its edges into the baking iron . As she thrust the iron in the ashes and raked on the coals she said , " Oh no . Harley Falk made it for her . They ' re real good friends . " " Does he come here often ? " " He stops in most generally , when he goes through . " " I ' ve heard queer things said of him . " " So have I. I do n't believe them , though . Have you ever seen him , Jerry ? " " I saw him once , riding by . He was going to the Irish shanties . But even then I did n't like his face . It looks wrong somehow to me . " " I do n't see that it does . I feel sorry for him . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What do you want me to do ? Close the door on him ? " " I did n't mean that . " " It ' s nice to know somebody may come in to see me . " Jerry was quiet for a moment . Then he said , " I ' d want to shoot a horse like that . " " Poor thing . I suppose Mr. Falk has got a friendly feeling to it . " She got composedly to her feet and wiped the flour from her hands . " Why do you feel so short , Jerry ? " " I do n't feel short . " She gave her head a little shake , drew up a chair , and resigned herself to sewing . " What are you making ? " " Overalls . " " For Polly ? For a girl ? " " Yes , why not ? They keep her clean . " " Boys ' clothes on a girl . "  | " What ' s wrong with it ? " She bit a thread . " Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance . He stirred uncomfortably . " Is everything all right here ? " " Yes . " " You do n't have any trouble with Mrs. Peck ? " " Oh no . She ' s a sinful drinker for a woman ; but she ' s kind enough . " Mary laughed lightly . " Lately she 's taken to dressing like a woman under thirty . She sent down to Albany for a yellow wig . She told me she was forty actually . And I ' ve been told she has passed seventy for a fact . " " I ' ve got to see her . " " About rent ? " " Yes . When would she be found ? " " Most any time . " " I think I ' 11 just go over and see her now . " Jerry 's voice was muffled . He got up suddenly and stepped outside . The baby looked round at the inflow of cool air . Mary continuedher sewing . Jerry crossed the yard in a few strides . The path brought him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an answer he looked out across the river flats . It was still , with the half-grey of evening . On the banks he could see a snipe loop down . Beyond , the traces of the digging showed along the causeway towpath . The Irish were still working . Since they had come not one had fallen sick . Fever and ague never troubled them . They were too tough . A minister had preached against them in the church . The high water had not flooded over the berms this year . Even if it came now , it was evident that the Irish would dig through by fall . Jerry knocked again . The door opened silently , and Mrs. Peck confronted him . She looked at him closely past the sides of her hooked nose . A girlish dress hung loosely from her old bent shoulders.  | " Well ! " Her voice was hoarse . " It 's the wandering husband come back to home . " " Mrs. Peck ? " " You 've seen me before , ai n't you ? " Suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I guess . " She put an effort at coquetry into her words . " Step inside if you want to see me . " She drew the door wide open and stood aside for him . He passed through a dim pantry into a kitchen . Behind him her stick scraped across the boards . " There 's a chair , young man . Set down . " Muttering to herself , she bent slowly backward into a rocker . A sigh escaped her . She pushed back her gorgeous yellow hair to show thin grey bristles underneath , and wiped aside some sweat with a hard-veined hand . On the corner of the table stood a bottle and a glass . " Have a little joyful ? " she suggested . " No , thanks . " " Well , I will then , if you ' 11 pardon me . " The bottle neck knocked against the tumbler rim . She smacked her lips , and her old teeth started niddering . As she lifted her chin to drink , Jerry saw her neck in the shawl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . He said , " I just dropped in to tell you I ' d like to pay for the cabin for three months ' advance . " " That ' s all right with me . " She peered at him sharply . " Going to be away a spell ? " " That long , maybe , " Jerry said stiffly . " I ' m just a curious old woman . People say I 'm evilly inclined . I drink too much . " She chuckled . " But I was an honest woman up to now . ' T is n't every woman was honest to a tanner for a husband . What are you up to ? " " There ' s work out at Irondequot . " " Thought of taking her along ? " " I do n't know what it ' s like out there . " " Well , I do n't , either . "  | She bent her head to her glass , then lifted her chin again to swallow . The illusion of the drinking old hen-turkey was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerry said , " If you ' re willing , I might as well pay you now . " " You do n't like to listen to an old woman . Nobody does that ' s young . I ' m not so old , my boy . I know a thing or two . I ' m not so old . Not by a half so old . " She chuckled . In the midst of the pleasant kitchen , Jerry thought of her there alone , growing graduallyinsensible  --  chuckling to herself . He pulled the money from his pocket . " I see that you ai n't told her . Well , you ' d better . She was ailing all through January . There ! Bite on that if you wo n't have my whiskey . " " What do you mean ? " She grinned . " Well , she 's a healthy girl . And you came home three days in January from your gallivanting . It looks to me it ' d happened once already . " Jerry stared at her . She winked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reconsider now ? " " I ca n't take her along . " " Oh no . " She watched him slyly . " I ' 11 look after her . She 's all right with me , young gallanter . You step off . " Her skinny hand at last accepted his money . He thought suddenly that she would wait , listen and wait , until she was sure she was alone before she hid it . People said she never banked her money . He went quickly out . It had grown darker in the yard . He stopped for a moment . He had not heard a thing . After waiting awhile he heard a wagon coming along the road . His eyes dimly made out a white horse . He thought , " It ' s not my business , " and went on to the cabin . Mary had lit a lamp there . He entered . He had business there.  |p295She  had put Polly into her cradle and was shoving it back in its dark corner . The child was already sound asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blond , curled knot of hair . " Mary " " Shh ! Do n't talk so loud . " He waited till they were both seated by the hearth . " Mary , how have you been ? " " Finely , thanks . " " Mary , do n't talk that way . " Her eyes met his accusingly . " Mrs. Peck ' s been talking . " He nodded . " Why did n't you tell me ? " But his voice was contrite . " I did n't know you wished to know . " " Mary ! " She softened to him . " Jerry , I ' m a bad , cross woman . I guess it just gets me so . You must n't mind . " She said again , " Being without her husband makes a woman strange maybe . " After another time she said , " I ' m grateful to you , Jerry . I love you , for a fact . " Then she said , almost laughing at them both , " I guess you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at your boots no longer . " His face reddened . " Yes , " said Mary . " You have got to go off again for a long spell . I ' 11 be good . " He nodded once more ; but he said , " Mary , you seem so strange from what you used to be . " " I guess we both are . " " You ' ve changed to me . " Her level forehead puckered slightly . When she looked up her eyes were bright with honesty . " Jerry , I do n't believe it . But yet , being so much alone hurts a pride in me . I brighten me all up when you 're to come back . But all the time I 've got it working in me to make you stay outside . As if I was a vengeful person , though I 'm not truly so . " " I do n't see . " " I guess we ' re different that way . " " I thought this cabin would be like what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem like yours . You said you wanted a little place . " " Yes , I did . But I saw us both in it , Jerry . " " Here we are . " He laughed a little . " And yet I feel outside of there . " His eyes were on the door . " Yes . You often seem so to me . Even when you 've held to me , I see your thoughts outside of there . " " I do n't plan it so . " They looked at each other . Again , with the firelight across her eyes , Jerry caught the ripple of the Hudson River . He heard the dock sounds . He saw her head against the Greenbush bank , all alone among those other redemptioners . " Mary , " he said . " Yes , Jerry . " " Maybe this is the last time I 've got to go away from you . The very last . Let 's pretend so . Let 's us pretend we are beginning right at the beginning . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time we went along the road . When Issachar Bennet picked us up . Do you recall him ? " She said , seriously , " Yes . I 'll try . But then we were together . I think it 's being left so much alone this second time . " As he watched her eyes he felt as if he saw a mantle closing down in them . He felt himself grow thin . He had no strength . There was a time in Uniontown when he put bacon in the smokehouse and the door blew shut behind him , enclosing him in fearful darkness . He beat upon the door with fists . They were so feeble against the heavy boards that no one heard him . It took him a long time to notice the smoke-hole . It made a spot of light upon the floor.  |p297When  his family finally discovered him , he was sitting in that spot of light . " I 've got to leave first thing to-morrow morning . " " I 'll make your travel dinner now , " said Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quick , she made good lunches . In the corner of the cabin he noticed a new coverlet that she was weaving . " That ? " she said in answer . " Oh , I have to have something to do . It 's easing to me , weaving is . " He drew a kind of comfort from her voice . He did not know how , nor see why . He felt himself like the little boy hammering at the smokehouse door . They spent the night in quiet . Just at dawn they rose together and Jerry dressed . It was a fine clear sunrise . Already the Irish were at work across the river ; he could see them clearly , armpit deep in the cold , watery muck . The skin on one 's bare buttocks was silver as a fish 's . " Good-bye . " Her kiss was cool . He could tell by her eyes that she had not slept . " Good-bye , Jerry . " " Hye ! Hello there , young man . " Jerry looked up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the time was a little before noon . He saw a bolster wagon , hooded , coming along behind four fine fat mares . They looked fresh and sleek , in spite of the hot sun , and their trace chains made a jingling . The driver who had hailed him was a plain-faced fellow ; but he had a ringing voice . " Morning , " Jerry said . The man drew up his team . " You seem to be passing my way , young man . Would you ride ? " " Surely , " Jerry grinned . " Stand on , then . I 'm aiming to get on a good piece before sundown . " As Jerry jumped over the wheel and sat on the broad seat , the driver whistled to his mares . Out in front of Jerry 's feet their backs looked fat as suet puddings . They had fancy harness , with dyed feather tufts and red horsehair tassels . He took another look at the driver . " Yes , sir , " he turned on Jerry suddenly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  height , heft , and coloring . Meet me , mister  --  Merwin Gandy . " When he talked his mouth shaped out each word with extraordinary largeness . Jerry could see his teeth , and his tongue , and if he chose he thought he might have looked all the way down to hardpan . " Jerry Fowler , eh ? " continued Mr. Gandy . " Fowler 's a good name . Shocks up well with Gandy . " He arched a judicious spit between the off mare 's legs . " You do n't meet up with them too often . Where are you heading ? Me , I 'm out for beyond Palmyra . Got my order four days back . Rounded up four beeves , killed and slaughtered , peeled and loaded them , and dug right out . I come from Oaks Old-Stand , that 's in Vienna township . Greatest beeving meadows in this country . Fat ? There ai n't no beeves in these United States a man can sink an arm in farther than our cattle . Gandy beeves . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along those mares . There ai n't one single straight line in the four of them . By God , they even bend their traces . That means horseflesh , young man . Same way with my hogs . You ought to see my hogs . That 's why I get prime prices . Folks call me talkative , but that ai n't so . Git , Lizabella . ( Named for my first daughter  --  a pretty mare , but devilish when she smells a stallion . ) Yes , we run to stoutness as a family , barring me . I 'm kind of medium only . But you 've got to leave off somewhere . Even the Lord , He had to borrow a rib , by God ! Where did you say that you was headed ? " They were rolling along at a brisk trot , and a bit of lather was rubbed out between the plump thighs of the wheel mares . The sweat smelled fat and strong . " That 's what I would call coincidental . Me , a medium man with four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall . Now , if that ai n't the strangest thing . Here , us two in this wide world ; why should we set out that way and meet up at this very place ? Why should I say , neighborly inclined ( back in Vienna township they call a Gandy neighborly ) , why should I say , Stand on ' , to you ? Because you was a likely-looking youngster ? No , that ai n't what it is . The whole thing 's a coincidence . That 's what the world turns on , seems as how . I told my wife that , when she announced me she was cornered . She said I was a twig . Merwin Gandy , if you ai n't a twig ! ' she says . And I told her that was what she said to me the morning after she was brided . Mostly in Vienna township womenfolkswill call all Gandys twigs . Not that I hold with nigger-pipple , bundling boys with girls , or topsy-turvy notions . I ' m a churchman , deacon , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been brooding all along the road , but now he could not help but smile . He asked , " Have you got quite a family , Mr. Gandy ? " Gandy arched another spit ; under his beard his cheeks collapsed like pricked balloons . He wiped his mouth with his medium hand . " My old girl piles them up on me for fair . Four girls , at this date instant , three boys , and something in the wind . " Jerry said , " I 'm not much of a family man myself . I 've got one girl ; but my wife is expecting something soon . " " The month ? " demanded Merwin Gandy . " I 'd put it down as sometime in October . " " October ! " Gandy bugled . " Did n't I say coincidence ? I ask you . My wife 's planning on her bedding for October ! By God , Fowler , let me shake your hand . All along , since you got on this wagon , I 've been thinking . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as offering a lad a lift . But not me . No , not Merwin Gandy . Come on here , Anna May ! ( Named for my aunt of the same name . ) Well , sir . There 's the coincidence complete . I wonder what it means for us . You here , me there . At Palmyra , now , I set you down . You here , me there . Maybe we 'll never see again or hear of hide nor hair of one another . That 's part of the coincidence . I get to thinking of these things and wonder what there 's into it . Now what do you think of this canal , hey ? " " It seems all right to me . " Gandy drew a breath and launched himself . The trace chains jingled through his voice . " It is . But it is changing this whole land . Look at Lyons  --  springing up like fountain water . We ' re heading for Palmyra  --  she 's growing stout . Time was when these-here lands was pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he herded to Niagara and take along a dozen boys . For why ? Because the Doanes and Tomblesons was scouting out the cattle money . Well , they 're gone . Roads did it , and the canal that 's coming is going to do it more . We used to see land-clearer 's smoke all round of us . They 've moved . The wood lots have a shape now . Why , you 'd hardly see a log house round Oaks Old-Stand now . And them along this road are mostly shingled . Trappers they have moved out westward . Most of them have even left the Purchase , as I hear tell . You ' d come upon their shanties handy to most every beaverfly . But now they 've fallen in . I know just one . It sets a way off'n this identical road . A feller , name of Lager , a most curious old coot , he used to trap it then . There was n't any road  --  this-here is new , you see . Lager 's logs , we called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a place myself . But he hid out there . It ' s got a butternut down in the ditch along the road . Not far from where you 're going , too . He moved out when he seen Geddes coming through the first time . Said the woods had smelled of men too strong for foxes . There 's coincidence again . Just last week I told a man about it . He preached in our meetinghouse . We fixed the price . He told me he made two deliveries . A dollar for a plain good sermon , and fifty cents was extra for a spray of hell-fire . Well , I paid him and he earned it . He had each last one of us sweating there for fair , and when you make a Gandy sweat , you 're getting somewhere . Well , I told him what I have been telling you ; and the queer thing was I ended up the same way . " Gandy turned his medium eye . Jerry bit : " Kind of a coincidence , was n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " boy , you are a twig . " It was a little after two when he released Jerry a mile beyond Palmyra . His last words were , " It 's got me going , our coincidence . I wonder what is into it . But I 'm a wondering man . Back inP 301 Vienna ... " But his mares wheeled him forward out of hearing . Jerry looked back . The road had crossed the course of the canal , again  --  it veered in a long curve to northward ; but the road went straight west through a rolling land , well wooded with low oak trees . And only for a little way he heard the work of diggers going forward : the shouts of men shoveling , the stamp of horses dragging scoops , the shriek of the wooden chain-drum of a stump-lifter , or the muffled thud of blasting powder where some poor devil of a contractorhad come upon a ledge of stone . Half the line from the marsh to Rochester had been contracted ; and work was well in hand . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through . In the bright sunlight , between him and the village , he saw the sites of locks eight and nine . A local carpenter was scratching his head over the fit of an iron casting in his timbers ; his helper chewed a languid cud ; and a mason was laying stone . Then Jerry turned into the woods , and their shadow passed over him . The road stretched forward through a dimness ; what light there was shut in between the levels of the tree leaves and the top of the scrub growth . " A man is caught by beauty " IT was quiet along the new post road . No tracks turned off to hidden farms . Though he had walked for an hour , he had met no travelers , nor heard any wheels . The fresh tire marks of a wagon that had passed on before him gave the only evidence that anyone besides himself had traveled the road this day . Even the woods were hushed . The mood that had clouded his face before Merwin Gandy overtook him now returned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he passed , unconscious even of the change that was taking place above the treetops . The hot green light that filtered through the new leaves began perceptibly to whiten , then grow cool . There was no sound of wind ;  | and if a leaf had stirred it would have startled him . His feet made the only sound , a steady thud , muffled by the light dust of the road . Then , all at once , he felt the sweat upon his face growing cold . He raised his eyes . Breathing had become difficult  --  as if in the lifeless sky a vaccum had been created and was drawing the air up through the trees . The light was dying and in the south a shadow pressed down on the woods . And then he saw that it was sweeping towards him through the trees . Far off , he heard muttering thunder ; and still farther off the whisper of rain . He came suddenly to himself . Oak woods offer scant shelter against rain . Nowhere within sight was any sign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shield him . But a little way ahead the darkening road turned downwardin a curve . He quickened his step . The woods were thicker here . In the growing darkness , a few beeches made a silver twilight . He glanced up once at a roll of cloud , black , high-piled , with a hungry forward licking of small tongues frayed out by the swollen wind it carried . The forest shook with the ominous low thunder that comes with hard rain . Beside the road he saw a tree lying in the ditch . A short , thick tree , its branches were lopped off along the sides . The axeman 's heavy blade had left clean cuts like shining faces . A tree like that would offer shelter underneath it if it were not in a ditch . But he ran for it , anyway . As he bent down to look under the stem , his eyes fell on the bark . " That 's a butternut , " he said aloud . Butternut , he thought ; there was something to remember about a butternut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It ' s got a butternut down in the ditch along the road .... Lager 's logs . " A Gandy would n't keep a Chester boar in it , maybe , but for Jerry Fowler it would offer better shelter than a fallen tree . Jerry looked along the road edge . He saw a little way forward where the fresh wagon tracks had halted , then turned over the ditch and up a slope of ground . A spring came down between round stones to meet the ditch . There had been an old track there in other years.  |p303It  was choked up with undergrowth , but the wagon had managed to draw through . Here and there a slim stem showed a scrape of bark . Jerry pressed forward . The cloud had rolled across the woods and the thunder in its heart was gathering frequency . The first shadow of blackness was passing on . Torn fragments of bluish-white cloud were racing under it . A grey wet light was being born , and far to south Jerry heard the rain take hold of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it carried straight up the slope to level ground and then wound in among the larger trees . Jerry began to run . He came suddenly into what had once been a small clearing . Along the woods ' edge the trees bent down , and then as their arms lifted again he saw the trees on the other side heel away . Great heavy drops struck into the dry earth and seemed to bounce . They left their marks in hollow rings . The wind was on the world . Lightning pitchforked over the clearing ; thunder swallowed the hot strike ; and in the echoes a tree crashed down . In the far corner of the clearing , a small cabin lifted scabrous walls . Beside the door there stood a wagon . Jerry shouted and ran for it . When he left the trees the wind pounced on his back . Behind him the woods roared with rain . Before he was halfway over , the sluices were unloosed upon his shoulders , and as he ran he heard the rain pass on across the world . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof of broken bark-sheathes . He pushed against the door . Its old latch was closed and there was no string . He knocked . Immediately it opened . A tall man held it as Jerry rushed in ; then leaned against it heavily . But the wind was like a foot thrust over the sill , and Jerry had to help him . The door went shut with a dull bang , and dust came powdering down . Jerry looked at the man . Seen once , a man could not forget the hatchet face , the humorous eyes enmeshed in wrinkles . He held his hand out . " Mr. Bennet ! Do you remember me ? "  |p304Issachar  Bennet wiped the rain from his face . " You do put me in mind of someone . " " Three years back , " suggested Jerry . " About this season . You won a bet off me . " " Now I recollect . " The thin face wrinkled up to smile . " I recollect the name  --  it 's Fowler . Jerry Fowler . I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's right , " said Jerry . " How did it turn out ? " Jerry said , " We did get married . We 've a girl . They 're living in Montezuma while I come out here to Irondequot . " Bennet beamed ; then he turned suddenly . " I 'd heard of this place from a talkative man in Oaks Old-Stand . I smelled the storm a-coming . " " Merwin Gandy . He told me this morning . " But the lean face had grown serious . " I found it out all right . But look what I found in it . " Jerry looked into the cabin . Scarce ten by ten , the floor was rubbled with the trash of years of desolation . The stick and clay chimney was crumbling . Even as Jerry looked , a chunk gave way under the rain . The rain and wind beat in the single window , fluttering the broken edges that had once been paper panes . Bennet had brought his horse inside , a small , black , flashy mare . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the open window and her tail tight tucked in under the wind . But her head was bent as if she understood the preacher 's words , and , as she eyed the corner in the shadow of the hearth , her sensitive ears kept pricking and falling back and pricking again . Old Lager , or whoever had last used the cabin , had made a bed of hemlock tips in the corner . They were dried out now and dusty ; but as Jerry stepped forward to see better , he made out a woman huddled on them . " She 's in bad shape , " Bennet whispered . " She was stunned when I came onto her . She 's been mishandled . " He had moved up behind Jerry 's shoulder ; and his voice spoke withp305a deep resonance that made Jerry turn . The amused eyes had grown sombre . " When a man travels round the way I do he sees a lot of queer things . But this is one of the queerest things I ever come across . " He stroked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her feet ! " He pointed suddenly . In the dustlike needles , Jerry made out rawhidethongs . He looked round at the Shaker . The old man nodded . " Some man has beaten her . All over . Yes  --  " a remnant of a twinkle fluttered his eyelids at Jerry 's expression . " I took her clothes off to see if anything was bad with her . She had n't any wounds , just marks of withes . Whoever it was he tied her up and left her  --  whether he wanted her to die , or whether he 's a-coming back , I could n't tell . Most like he wanted her to die . " " Why ? " " Well , she was here all last night anyway . " " How do you know ? " " There on the edge of her skirt . Where it ai n't tossed . A cobspiderused it for one corner of his web . Cob-spiders spin at night . " He paused , his face bent down in thought . A fine dust came drifting down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell of dry-rot . The mare 's black coat had lost its sheen . Jerry became aware of the thunder again ; it was rolling off to north of them . Through the stripped window he saw a silvery wet line rising over the trees . The straggling ends of the rain were passing them with fitful gusts . The air smelled leafy . " You know , Jerry , " Bennet was saying , " if that talkative man had n't felt obliged to tell me everything he knew in this world I 'd have driven through that storm , and she 'd have still been tied here . " His hand again caressed his chin . " A thing like that makes even me consider Providence . " He bent down suddenly beside the woman . " She 's just a girl , " he said gently . Jerry bent forward . Bennet had a bowl on the edge of the hearth . " Water and brandy , " he said.  |p3o6His  dry old hand crept with sensitive fingers under her cheek and turned up her face . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead . As Jerry watched , his cheeks grew slowly red . From her left temple across her nose and down her right cheek to the barely visible angle of her jaw , a welt showed purple . She was small-featured . Her nose was short and slightly arching ; her chin was close and round , with greater breadth than length ; her small lips , fully rounded , were curved as if she slept . She had black hair ; not the blue-black of an Indian 's hair , but inky as a crow 's wing . " Pretty hair . " Old Issachar pressed it back from the forehead . It was tight-curled there , damp . His free hand reached behind her shoulder and drew it forward like a rope . The ends were tangled from being lain on , rough with hemlock needles , with here and there a hairpin loosely skewering them . " Fine hair , " said Issachar . " It would fall down real easy . " He draped it over her shoulder and laid her back upon her side . Getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walked over to the window . " It would be a torture to her now to put her in a wagon , " he said . " We ca n't leave her here alone . We 've got to stay . Or I ought , anyways . How about you , are you due anywhere to-night ? " " Not ' specially . I 'm going to Irondequot . " " That is n't above an hour 's walking . You can get in there to-morrow . " " I 'll stay with you . " " The point is one of us has got to wrestle up some wood . " " I 'll go . " " That ai n't it . There is n't any handy to the cabin here . We 've got no axe . And anyway she ought to have some milk in a little while . One of us has got to get provisions  --  for ourselves as well as her . There ai n't sense in our going hungry . " " All right , IT get ahem . " Jerry stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . When Jerry turned he kept his eyes averted.  | " I was thinking , Jerry , suppose the warrior that did this-here to her comes back . I 'm an oldish man . " He looked comically at Jerry and began a feeble grin . " I 'd be plumb scared to death . I never was any good in a rough-and-tumble . " " Do n't you carry a pistol ? " " Yes , I do . But I 've never had a load for it . I 'd be frightened to let it off . That 's actual fact .... " He looked down along his lanky legs . " Now I guess you know the kind of man Ike Bennetis . " Waiting here in dark , " he muttered . The sky had cleared , but the sun was already going down . " I 'll stay , then , " Jerry said . " But she ought to have a fire . " He cast round the cabin . A couple of rafters had fallen in at the back end . He broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good dry wood . He rested them across the sill-log and jumped on them until he had convenient pieces . It took a minute only to start the shavings he made with his knife . The smoke bent and doubled before the chimney sucked the draught . " Thank the Lord it 's rained , " said Jerry . " It would n't take much to start that chimney burning , with the clay so loose . " The Shaker had observed all his proceedings with vastly relieved eyes . " I 'll be getting along , " he said . He caught the mare 's bridle . " Come on , Daisy . " Jerry went out with him to help him hitch . As he started to climb in the wagon , he said , " Oh , Jerry . I 've got some snake-oil salve laid up in bear fat . " He fished in a pack behind the seat . " I 'm peddling cures along the side for them that ca n't pay me for religion . " The good humor in his voice was restored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But this stuff 's good . I paid a shilling to a squaw near Buffalo for it for myself . Rub it in light , and keep on rubbing till the skin feels loose . " " Me rub it on her ? " " Surely . Better you than me . Ai n't you a married man ? " He chuckled , clucked up his mare , and turned her for the road.  |p308Jerry  watched him go . The sun had set , and looking into the west , he saw the afterglow like cool green water floating lilac clouds . A steamy breath of soaked leaves lifted through the woods . Somewhere a thrush was calling . He touched the fire up . Hearing its crackle , he could forget the cobwebbed walls . He thrust two sticks into the ground and draped the old blanket Issachar had left across them to get warm . Then he closed the door and dropped the latch in place . For an instant he stood facing the warped boards , his ears alert . He could hear no breathing over his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her eyes were closed . The arched brows were smooth and the thick , straight lashes brushed the cheeks . Her skin was without red ; but it had a velvety texture in the firelight . Seen in sleep her face was almost like a child 's . He glanced at the jar in his hand for a moment , distastefully , then looked back at her . Her eyes were open . Her eyes were black , like her hair , with a faint lustre , very large . As she looked at his embarrassed face , a little painful smile touched her mouth with a hint of coquetry . Then as she tried to move her head , her lower lip snapped in against her teeth , and Jerry heard her indrawn breath . He said , kneeling down beside her , " I ' m going to rub your back with salve . It 's going to ease a lot . Do you mind ? " She smiled a little . He spread the blanket on the hearth in double thickness . Then as carefully as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain in her body . But she was wordless , like some small hurt animal . He put her down upon the blanket on her face , and awkwardly bent over her . She said , " My dress is laced in front . " Her voice was barely above a whisper . He helped her onto her side , and her eyes looked up at him . They were looking into his with a total absence of abashment . " I do n't mind . "  |p309She  said it almost bubblingly , as if she found drollery even in pain . His fingers seemed stiff with large blunt ends , and their very carefulness was clumsy . She lay motionless under his touch , and sick though she was , her body gave him a sense of life . She was young , but she was no child . She was not beautiful by the points that he judged beauty by , but her duskiness was lovely . He kept his eyes resolutely on his hands , but in spite of him his sight would stray . At last he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . She shivered as he drew the dress back from her shoulders , worked her arms out of the sleeves and bared her slim back . " Who did this to you ? " She did not answer ; she had laid her cheek against the blanket . He felt the nerves spring under the skin as he spread on the salve . It reeked strongly in the heat , but it sank in as if the skin were hungry for it , and he thought under his hand he could feel the welts lie down . She made no sound till he was done ; but after a while her lids closed over her eyes , and she sighed . " It makes me feel so much easier , mister . " " My name ' s Jerry Fowler . " She was silent for a minute ; then she said , " Mine ' s Norah Sharon . " " Who did this ? " he asked again . " I ' m very grateful . " Her voice was low , upon the edge of drowsing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , " Who 's the old man that was here and gave me brandy ? " " His name ' s Issachar Bennet . He ' s gone for milk and things . So you can eat . " " I ' d like to drink a little milk . " " That ' s fine . Feeling any better ? " " Lots better . " " Do you want me to move you back ? " " No , it ' s nice here . " " Is there anything I could do to make you feel better ? "  | " If you could find a comb I ' d like my hair combed . " He had a carved bone comb of his own in his pocket and he fished it out . She was like a cat under the touch of it . Her head moved imperceptibly to meet a stroke in some spot that she cherished . It made her drowsy . By the time Jerry had untangled the ends and tied the rope with a thread , she was fast asleep . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knees , hearing his own heart beating , watching her quiet sleep . He could not keep his eyes from her ; they kept questing for her face . She was not beautiful , he told himself again . She was too small for beauty . The night became a still , clear time for thinking . But Jerry could not sort his thoughts . Whenever his eye fell on the sleeping figure , his brain became disturbed . He saw the curve of a shoulder into the small ribbed back , and he wondered how she came to be there , what man had brought her to this cabin , what his right over her had been . He felt his own heart thud against his chest . He saw the sweep of the black lashes on her cheek . The warmth of the fire brought her color back ; a clear bright red  --  it almost startled him to see it . He put one hand lightly against her cheek to see if she was fevered , and her left hand stirred in her sleep , creeping up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . He looked at his hand a while . Long ago his mother said he had the gift of handling things ; it was a gift in a man , like preaching or making money in the law . He wondered in his brain how the hand might be that had put those marks upon her back . So he heard , long afterwards when his firewood was getting low , the thresh of a wagon on the brushy trail . He went outside to meet it . Issachar Bennet 's mare was threading over the clearing . The Shaker shook himself when he climbed down . " It is the dreariest-looking place I ever saw , by moonlight . How is she , Jerry ? " " She ' s sleeping now . "  |p31IBennet  reached into his wagon . " Here ' s milk . " He handed over a cool jar . " If it ai n't buttered by the jouncing . Here ' s a smoked ham , small , the joint end . Here ' s corn meal and sugar and tea . It ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I ' 11 bring her in . She ' s used to sleeping with me outside of a barn and will act quiet . " The mare was dainty with her hoofs . She seemed to know a sleeper should not be disturbed . While Jerry unharnessed her , Bennet went over to the girl . " She does look better . She ai n't really badly hurt . Just sore . She ' 11 get righted quickly . " He came back to feed the mare , and then the two of them sat down on the floor at the girl 's feet . With their knives they whittled off ham to eat while waiting for a tin of tea to brew . " Did she come round , when I was gone ? " " Yes . " " She did n't tell you nothing ? " " No . She would n't answer who did it . " The Shaker examined her sleeping face . " It ' s a peculiar strange thing . Finding her so . Most likely she wo n't ever tell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how it come that Merwin Gandy should tell us both about this place . " Issachar Bennet looked up . His eyes twinkled like little bits of glass . " Do you think he done that ? Then you ought to see his wife . That man ' s hen-ridden for a rooster , Jerry . No , he told us of this place because it ' s one of the few little things he knows about . I stayed with him . Give him half a day and that man just begins repeating . It is a wonder to him to speak out like a man . " He shook his head . " Merwin Gandy can graft fat on animals . But he could n't do that thing . "  | The tin of tea put out a fragrance . " I ' 11 lace it with a thread of brandy , " Bennet said , " then we can talk a while . " Under the brandy the cabin seemed to close in with comfort . Bennet had brought an armful of split oak that burned with quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing . The old man had no interest in his work ; he wished to know of Mary , and the baby . " It makes me feel I started things . Adam you and Eve for her . I ought to make a garden . " Jerry said , " Where did you get that mare ? " " Oh , I got kind of tired of them bays I had . I drove a roan a while . I traded him for her one night down in Ohio . I do n't know whether she ' s Ohio bred . I never saw the man to ask him . " He had been wandering for three years , covering eight states and a territory . " I have n't been back in New Lebanon . The more I wander round , the less I consider being of a sect . I never took it serious . It is a pity , for I ' ve got the gift for preaching . Sometimes it makes me fearful . " He sighed . " All they want is to be told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I tell them all about me , only the way their minds consider such things . " He stared a while at the fire . " It ' s a peculiar thing , Jerry . You travel through the west and you see people settling down . At first ' they ' re far apart . They ' re neighborly and stand together . The Indian was a great thing for them . Now the Indian ' s gone and they have to look for devils . It ' s queer . " He sipped his tea . " As soon as they get money they set up a school . Later a church . But always the school first . It seems these people want to get to being gentryfied . Learning is a splendid thing if you can take it just for knowledge . But to them it means money , setting up above your neighbors . One year a man will go to help his neighbor , Joe , nine miles off . Next year that same man ' s in a town , incorporated under statute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backward man . He ' s still living under logs . ' And his wife says , I do feel sorry for Joe 's womenfolks , to have to work in darkness under paper windows . Why , she has n't had a petticoat in these three years . ' They feel sorry for them and they leave them be . " He nodded at the sleeping girl . " Now I do n't feel sorry for that girl , beyond the pain she ' s in . Most likely she ' s just caught herself in her own spinning . " Jerry said , " In an incorporated town the way you say , it could n'thappen to her . " " No . Maybe not . But she could raise a powerful harm against some other person . This way she just got caught . The man did it , and he ' s gone . He wo n't be even hanged . " " He ought to be . " " No doubt . But suppose he come back and you should rise up and kill him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At least you would n't have a lot of people all aroused to kill him with you . You 've never seen a public hanging , Jerry . " Jerry brooded . He felt the firelight against his hands . He thought it would have been a better thing if he had walked the storm out . Better for him , better for Mary . " Suppose , " said Bennet , stroking his thin chin , " suppose now you should get caught by her . I would n't blame you . Supposing you to think yourself in love with her . If I was younger I might be myself . She ' s got a sense to rouse a man . It is a natural thing . A man is caught by beauty , some man by a peach tree , some man by a horse , and some by women . That ' s what the Lord , supposing it is God , put into us . But it takes different ways . The pity is until we are too old for it , we generally do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you ever see it , you dig in and grab it . " His eye fell on the mare again and he laughed softly . " I wonder if the man that owned that mare saw any beauty in that hammer-headed roan I left him ? But he ' s a better traveler than she 'll ever be . And anyway the next time I feel called upon to deal , the next man will have her . She ' s dainty , is n't she ? "  | As he spoke , the girl woke up . She stirred , turned over , and her eyes were swimming with her drowse . " What did you say , mister ? " Bennet smiled . " Just a word . How are you feeling , missy ? " " Ever so much more easier . " " Would you like some milk ? " " Yes . " He warmed her a cup of it . Jerry watched the girl 's eyes take the old preacher in . A strange man for a preacher . Then her glance came round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was slyness in it , estimate , and the same strange sense of invitation . " Thank you , mister , " she was saying to Bennet . " What 's your name , missy ? " " Norah Sharon . " " That ' s a pretty name , " he said . " It seems to suit . " She was drinking her milk . When he spoke , she took her lipsfrom the cup and looked aside at Jerry . Jerry was just aware of her . He saw her tongue come out and lick aside a drop . She lowered her glance to the cup , and as her lips met the rim she smiled a little . The wrinkles at the corners of the preacher 's eyes were gathered up in nets . He rubbed his hands with a small , dry , whispering sound . " Have you got any friends out here ? " She shook her head . " Nowhere to go , no money ? " " No , mister . " Jerry 's heart began to beat . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' m on a preaching circuit . I wish I could helpyou . But strange people are close-questioning about their preachers . " He appeared to think . " Nowhere you could go back to ? " She said , " I left my home . I could n't stand it . " " What 'll we do with you ? " " Never mind me , " she said to Bennet . She spoke sturdily , but Jerry felt his pity for her rise.  | " What do you say , Jerry ? We ca n't just turn her loose . " Jerry spoke thickly . His face was sweating and he was ashamed of his utterance . " I ' 11 board her , if she needs it . " " You ca n't stick her in a working camp . " " Maybe Mann ' s Mill . I 've heard Mr. Bates say it was handy . " " You ca n't have a girl like her so close to workers . " Bennet clasped his knees . " Corbal ' s up the creek . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . He might board her . " You 'd rather be alone a spell , would n't you ? " he asked Norah . She nodded . " I 'd feel scared of him finding me again . " " Who is he ? " Jerry demanded for the third time . " I do n't know his name . " Bennet looked over her head at Jerry and shrugged . " You ' 11 never find that out , " he seemed to say . But she was undisturbed . She seemed content to take whatever came her way . Finishing her milk , she lay back again and closed her eyes . Bennet said , " We might as well all of us get some sleep . " He and Jerry took the dusty bed of needles . The girl was already sleeping . Jerry lay still . The firelight kept flowing over the recumbentfigure of the girl within reach of his hand . Her head was towards him . In the corner the mare drowsed with hanging nose . After a while , Bennet began to snore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He watched the girl . She stirred a little , and then her hand stole out and came upon his hand . The touch was warm and very dry ; and the blood stiffened in his veins . The mare turned her head , her eyes dull coals against the firelight . He could not sleep . The mare lay down carefully and quietly . Bennet snored on , and the fire died . Outside the cabin a barred owl hooted mournfully . But he had a feeling that a loneliness that he had lived with many months was lifting , that the hand in his had touched a nerve , and that it was not right he should feel glad . . . . In the morning , the girl said that she was able to ride . Her facep316was brighter . She was very quiet , between them on the seat ; and both of them were speechless in the early morning . The mare , stepping briskly , pitched her ears at roadside clumps , and tossed her bits . The wheels rolled smoothly down the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track . " This way turns up to Corbal 's . Mann 's is just beyond the woods . Listen . You can hear the men . " They could hear voices . " You ' 11 want to get in this morning , Jerry ? " " Maybe I 'd better . " " Then if you ' 11 pass the girl a couple of dollars , I 'll take her up . I ' 11 tell Corbal she ' s my niece and I ' m boarding her while I ' m on my circuit . He knows who I am  --  or thinks he does . " The girl smiled down at Jerry . Her eyes were soft . Bennet said , " I ' 11 tell Corbal you ' re a relative and keeping an eye on her . Maybe you can visit with her sometimes . " " Yes . " The old man chuckled . He spoke to the mare . The wheels spun . The girl looked back . Her eyes were speaking for her . Jerry watched till she was out of sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always judged a girl : she was too small . When Jerry came forth from the woods , he found the Irondequot Valley sloping downward from his feet . On the left of the road , Mann 's mill-dam stuck out of a sheer hillside ; it backed up water in a narrow lake along the edge of the hill . On the north shore was lower land . The mill itself was next to the wheel housing on the north end of the dam : a big over-shot wheel of eight-foot radius . The mill was built half in stone and half in wood . Jerry could not make out how far the pond extended . The dam , constructed of cribs and broken rock and earth , had a lift of twentyfeet , so the pond must reach much farther than his eye could carry . Leaving the road before he reached the bridge , he climbed the hill . It was heavily scrubbed with maple , birch , and hemlock ; but near the top the shrubbery thinned out ; and suddenly , in an open space , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A little way ahead , to mark the beginning of a northward curve , he saw another set . He followed them . As he went on , the ground rose on his right ; it was bushed over lightly there with blueberries and buffalo sod . He mounted with it , and in a little while he saw , standing on the apex of the hill , Bates and Myron Holley , the commissioner . At Jerry 's shout Bates turned round . He waved his hand and his face lit up . He touched the commissioner 's elbow . Myron Holley turned . Together they waited on Jerry 's approach . As he came up , his eye took in the course of the crossing ; instantlyhe felt a wave of admiration for Geddes , who , alone with one axeman and one rodsman back in 18og , had had the vision to find out this place . Bates shook his hand . " I ' m glad to see you , Fowler . I thought you might come yesterday . " " I nighted in the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Myron Holley said . He had a quiet , cultured voice , and calm brown eyes . It was the first time Jerry had met him face to face ; but next to Clinton , Wright , and Geddes , he admired this man 's work . With a single driver he had to cover over a hundred miles of digging , paying off the contractors , making judgments for farm damage , settling fifty-cent accounts to axemen , rodsmen , ploughmen , hearing the troubles of a man who laid a culvert and making out his advance , or spotting misappropriation of state funds and bringing in the magistrates . He nighted where night found him , in shanties , in a tent he carried on his wagon , making out his day 's accounts by candlelight , with a smoke pot on the table to ward off the bugs , accounts that ran from a **26;1818;TOOLONG contract down to a fourteen-cent spike-lifter . Three years after , the legislature would rise up in wrath because he could not tell them where thirty thousand dollars had gone ; truly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle over two million dollars in cash , of varying state currencies in shillings , fips , silver half-dollars , and local factory bills from seventy-five cents upwards ; but could n't a man keep ledgers , they demanded ? He told them that for two months in the spring he traveled on foot  --  carrying his cash in his hand satchel , with one man to bring his clothes and tent and able to keep only rough notes of expenditures ; but that , they said , was not the point : an honest man who handled public funds kept books . . . . But now Jerry saw a man already tired in his body . He said , " I consider this the biggest work the whole line will show . Bates has been arguing me out of wood , Mr. Fowler . I do n't need much convincing . " Bates , in his dry , matter-of-fact voice , said , " Yes , Jerry . Look here . Look over there . You ' re not an engineer , but you can tell how much wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trough to carry forty feet by four of water over there ? " Jerry looked down upon the crossing as if he looked down on a map . " The hill looks ninety feet to me , " he said . It dropped off sheer from his feet . Now he could see the course the canal would follow . The hill stuck out into the horseshoe pond like a lizard 's tongue . To west the ground sloped up again , almost to the hill 's level . " We ' re standing on a hundred feet , " said Bates . " But the bottom of the ditch is seventy-six feet over the pond level . Eighty feet in all . And west , there , the ground mounts up again to this level in twelve hundred feet . Near a quarter mile . " " How wide 's the pond water there ? " " Four chains and seven links from edge to edge . " Jerry thought . He said , " Water that length and height would have an awful outward thrust against the braces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  whoever drew me plans . " Holley sighed  | " I think the same . But I have got to convince them back in Albany . They passed over my head in ordering timbers . " Bates said , " We can use them other places . Now they ' ve spent that money for economy they may feel better towards us . They ' ve showed their will . " " What am Ito do ? " Jerry asked Bates . " Mann ' s done all his spring sawing . We 've had to rent the mill for summer to let down the water . We ' re going to build a stone culvert . After that , we ' 11 tell them . Then if they want wood they can send someone out to build it . They wo n't get any engineer . " " And me ? " said Jerry . " You ' re to lay a flooring , boy . You 've got to set in piles . I 've figured out embankment slope for that height . The floor has got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water if we make the arch full Roman . The piles are all stacked down there . " Next to the monumental stacks of gleaming , brand-new timbers , Jerry saw a great black heap of piling . " Most of them are twenty foot , " said Bates . " You 've got to pile in quicksand and I 've figured on eight hundred piles . But there are two hundred more in case it ' s bad . " He faced east . " Mann ' s opened up his sluice . " Jerry and Myron Holley looked down across the treetops . Mann 's dam made just a thread beyond the deep-blue pond , and his mill was a tiny box to look at . But below the dam a surge of coffee-colored water boiled away . " It will take two days , to get it down , " said Bates . " You ' ve got a piler ? " " Bemis . Roger Hunter has brought him in . " Jerry looked back at the culvert-site . Behind a clump of hemlocks stood a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grey spot that marked a wagon-hood . He made out Hunter 's odd-colored horses grazing alongside . " We might as well go down , " said Bates . " I ' ve got a boat to row across with . " Holley said good-bye.  | " My driver ' s down at Mann 's . I ' ve got to get back to pay up with Dancer Borden by to-morrow night . " He went away . Jerry looked out before he followed Bates . Miles and miles west he could see across the level upland . Rochester lay that way , the Genesee , and miles beyond was Erie . But he turned quickly south . There lay the end of Mann 's pond , and the creek coming in through flags . His eyes followed the course southward through a soft-wood forest . There was a clearing a half mile beyond , and in it he saw a little gristmill . Eastward the view was closed to him ... . In the shanty , Hunter was polishing his bells . He rose up eagerly as Jerry entered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you . " He shook hands powerfully . " When I got in last night I seen your tool box in the corner . And I thought I ' d wait . " His hard face shone , and he sat down again and occupied his strong hands with vigorous polishing . " I have n't seen you for a long time . " " That ' s right , I guess . We 've been right occupied in Rochester . They ' re trying to make stone stick in the Genesee above the falls . And I ' ve been hauling it for them . Jerry , when do you plan to come out there ? " Jerry smiled . " There ' s time enough . " " Not too much . Water will be in Montezuma soon . In two years more water will be in Albany , and long before that time boats will have hauled clear in to Rochester . " " That ' s time enough . " " Listen here , " said Hunter . " I used to think a pity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more when this got finished . Now I am pernickety as a filly brought to stud awaiting its completion . I 've spoke to Colonel Rochester , and he will back us up in a transportation company . Say , will you join in with me ? " He looked across . " There ' s no one I 'd like better . "  |p321Jerry  could not think of things ahead ; something in him was stirred ; a new nerve ripened . He said , " I 've got this place to set up first . " Well , you ' 11 have company for it . A suckish little runt . Bemis , you remember him ? But Jerry , I ' 11 hold out for you till next spring . Can you let me know then ? " " I ' 11 let you know then . " He felt Hunter eyeing him shrewdly . " If I ' d not known you was a married man , I ' d think you were girl-piney . Maybe you are at that . I wouldn ' t blame you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bemis swaggered in under his bowler hat . He passed Jerry an unfilled receipt for haulage of a piler . " Here , " he said . " Will you sign this ? " " I ' 11 do my best , " said Jerry . " Thanks , " said Bemis . Jerry filled the receipt and passed it over to Hunter . " What 's news back eastward ? " he asked . " They ' re making progress , " Bemis said . " Them southern delegatesdo n't know how us Americans can dig . You remember Weston ? " " The English engineer ? " " Yes , him . He said it would take two whole years to blast the rocks around Cohoes . We ' ve done it in eighty days . " Hunter gave Jerry a wink at Bemis 's " we . " But he said , " An Englishman 's all right . The only trouble with him is he has n't ever considered an Irishman . You put an Irishman against a stone mountain and give him plenty of blasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it scientific , but an Irishman would just bust loose . " He had fought himself to keep away ; but to-day with a south wind tossing out the trilliums up the bank , he would go . The track for the hammer was bolted together and was being raised on its angle braces . It squatted knee-deep in the slimy muck from which the water had drawn down , its sledges buried ; and Cosmo Turbe on his spiked boots climbed the steep of the track with the rope to carry the weight . He passed it over the pulley . Plute Sowersby , boot-deep in mud , caught the end and guided it round the winch-drum , turned the right-hand crank until the driver 's weight was taken up and its wheels caught on the iron tracks . Dripping wet upon the bank , his plump , smooth face mud-smeared , Bemis rubbed his hands together and stuffed himself with pride . " She ' s my own idea . I done her new this winter . A take-down piler especially built for this big ditch . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warningly for Jerry 's benefit . But Jerry was thinking with the wind against his face , " I ' d ought to go and see if she ' s all right . I ' m responsible for her . I ' d have gone up sooner but for starting things . I will go up to-night . " Plute was patting the crank . " I 've always hankered to get my fists on this . You and me will have a picnic , Cosmo . " The little man slid down the tracks , leaped off , and landed in the mud . He came up squeezing fistfuls of black slime . He held them out to Plute . " You poor bezabor , what do you think you have got there ? " Grinning widely , Cosmo opened his slimy hands . " What do you think you 've got , you poor dumb frog ? " " Picnic hands , " said Cosmo seriously . " Picnic hands ? My God , what are you talking of ? " " Well , " and Cosmo bashfully dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white stockings . " Bates was casting the sight for the two corner-piles . His rodsman steadied a striped stake on the upward line upon the hill . With his monster all complete , Bemis forgot his importance . He was hungry to feed it . He laid his bowler hat face down upon a tuft of grass and sprang into the muck . He floundered out to his vast engine , an impish figure , his pants moulded tightly over his solid little buttocks.  |p323Four  gangs laid hold of corner ropes and dragged the engine to face north . She crept forward inch by inch to where Plute now held the up-ended pile ; his great hands flattened like red lichens on the wood ; his shoulders bent and his mouth breathing audible prayers for speed . They inched the engine forward until the angle of the track came flush with the top of the pile , and Cosmo set on the angle cap that transferred the slam of the hammer into a vertical thrust against the pile-crown . He leaped into the well and took the left-hand crank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The paul tickled and the hammer climbed . Bemis with a mallet knocked up the paul . The hammer moved ; the rope slid faster than the eye could follow ; the drum gears roared ; there was a heavy thud and Plute was looking down at his crooked arms and the blisters on his palms . " By dog , " he whispered , " she went down three foot . " " She ' s set her tooth . Wind up them winches . " The gears began to rattle and the paul danced lightly . Once more Bemis tapped it up . The hammer fell like a bolt . This time the men holding the corner ropes felt the thud in the muck against their boot-soles ; and the driver automatically lifted over the blow and squatted down again a good foot backward . Plute took Cosmo 's place at the left winch . They sank her in a dozen drives . Two men held up the new pile on the line that Bates was calling . The driver sludged her way ahead . Her beetle jaws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with an appetite for hemlock . Cosmo patted her timbers . " Bite her , Josey . " Josey bit . But Jerry , passing Bates 's orders and figuring the cribbing , thought , " I ' d better not go up . I dass n't trust it . " And as the pile-driver thudded down , he seemed to hear old Issachar say , " I would n't blame you . Bates said , " That ' s old grass muck . It smells like ague. "  | " I take the candle " CORRAL 'S MILL was a tiny shack housing a single set of stones . A nameless brook running west into the Irondequot supplied power for its ten-foot wheel ; and a woods track of a quarter mile connected it with the Victor road . Jerry came upon it all at once . A turn round a balsam opened the tiny valley . A meadow full of swale grass bordered the brook with cowslips and the clean-edged blades of blue flag . The stream slid over a bed of moss and cress ; when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chest , and the water he sucked up was cold as snow . He splashed his face with water , and a trout sprang off as if some finger had released a trigger in it . Down the glade he heard the mutter of the running mill ; and when he had followed the road a little way , he saw its roof against the tamaracks , shaking over the drive of the trundle . The race was drinking ; just beyond it the buckets of the wheel caught frothy cupfuls . Jerry stood at the edge of the dam to listen to the noise of milling  --  the rush of the spillway , the sloshy creak of the wheel , the rumble of the trundle , and the mouthing roar of stones . His eyes swept over the clearing . There was a smoke in the house chimney . The door was open , letting a finger of sunlight into the kitchen , but he could see no moving dress . Behind the tamaracks a fretful dog was barking ; the sound came faintly over the mill din . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But nowhere could his eyes find what they searched for . So he stepped down over the shoulder of the dam to the mill door . Inside , a mist was powdering from the hopper . The upright timbers shook like trees in wind . The miller bent over the millspoutto let the flour dribble through his fingers . Now and then hep325rubbed it in his palms and blew upon it . Then his left hand touched the brayer lever . He did not hear Jerry 's entrance ; no sound could live in the running mill but that made  --  by the feasting stones . But when Jerry put his hand on the man 's elbow , he turned slowly . " My name is Jerry Fowler , " shouted Jerry . In all his face the miller 's still blue eyes alone had color . His cheeks were dusted , his beard was coated white on every hair . His beard opened to say , " Hey ? " He was without surprise . Jerry repeated his name . " Can you say if Norah Sharon ' s in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , shook his head , and slowly moved to the other side of the trough . His grey boot kicked the trundle lever . There came an instant diminution in the thunder of the mill . The dust rose thinner ; the trundle clacked emptily on its ratchet ; the timbers shook more easily ; only the wheel outside , relieved from work , began to gain a revolution . Silence beat in upon them , harder for Jerry to speak against than mill sounds . " Eh ? " roared the miller . " I ' m kind of hard of hearing . Speak out louder , mister . " Jerry bawled his question once more , conscious of the miller 's eyes on his strained mouth . The stones were falling off from their fullthroatedroar . The note rose up for a dramatic instant , then whimpered down . " You want to see the girl ? " shouted the miller . " Yes . " " You need n't get so hot about it . " The miller beat his sleeves out . " Most likely she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , can hear that engine beating where they ' re making the canal . " " Thanks . " " You 're Bennet 's nephewy ? " " Yes . " " You need n't look so hot . My name is Nathan Corbal . I was a boy myself once , queer as you may think it . So I ai n't surprised . Stay back for supper . " " Thanks , " Jerry said again . Corbal kicked the trundle lever over and the water laid its hand upon the mill , and the silence that had seemed so mastering a breath before was battered forth . The miller hoisted a sack and cast its contents into the hopper with a practised fling of his shoulder . He caught the flour from the spout . " This wheat smells colicsome to me , " he shouted . But Jerry had gone out . A footpath meandered along the brook bank ; and the grass that Jerry walked through reached halfway to his knees . The sun was warm against his face , and the air perfect in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and floated a misty veil over the small valley . The stream crept under the overhanging grass banks , occasionally offering reflection in the corner of a bend ; its current was like glass . It curved round the tamaracks and suddenly entered the dark water of the Irondequot ; and here the footpath turned north , mounting into the woods . Jerry came upon her in an open patch of fine pale woods-grass where honeysuckle and rue unfolded darker leaves . She was looking down at the running water of the creek . On the far bank , flags raised a palisade along the water , and gazing back at the girl a heron stood on tiptoe . They looked as if they had not moved for hours . But when Jerry stepped forth , the heron tilted forward . He lost his grace ; his wings became lugubrious , heavy , pulsing oars , and his reflection in the water , which had been so clear when he stood still , now broke across the eddies of the central current . The girl lifted her head to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profile , clear-cut against the leaves , the small arched nose , the dark eye absorbed in the bird 's flight . She was wearing the same dress , fitting her slim arms closely as she leaned back upon them with her hands in grass . He could find no words . Then she turned slowly to face him . Her lips bent quietly . Thep327heavy , deep-fringed lids sank slightly over her dark eyes , and her head bent . He sat down awkwardly beside her . " I could n't come up sooner , " he said at last . " I hope you 've been all right . " She lifted her eyes to his . " Mr. Corbal has been nice , and his wife too . " Her answer subtly conveyed a different meaning . " It must have been lonesome to you . " " A person feels quiet here . A person feels safe . " " Just the same , it must have been lonesome to you . " Her glance was slow , time-taking ; her voice half toneless . " Down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was the piler . " " It sounded powerful . Like a bittern . But it came all day long . " Jerry 's hands twitched on his knees . " It does get into one . " Her eyes dropped down before him . " Yes . It must be a powerful piece of work , " her voice went on . " And the queer old man that brought me here said you had charge of it . " " I ' m just building the culvert flooring . There ' s stonework to do after , and then the embankment . " " I would mightily like to see it sometime . " " There ' s nothing to see now , except a lot of men working in muck mud . " " What do you do ? " " Drive piles . " He felt a little prick of pleasure at her interest . But as he looked at her , his instinct veered away from work . Now , by an ironic twist , he saw that he would rather be away , lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw his life as Mary had desired . Himself alone , performing his own tillage , coming home . " Drive piles , " he repeated . " That ' s all . Then nail on wood . People will look at it after and say how fine the engineering is . " He listened to the creek.  |p328Norah  said , " I have n't told you thanks for what you 've done , Mr. Fowler . " Her eyes swept up from her hands to his face . And again she lowered the lids with that odd conveyance of humility and invitation . " I ' m very grateful to you . There are n't many men , I guess , would take such care of a strange girl . I take it very kind . " Jerry 's hands plucked strongly at the grass . He felt a power in his fingers ' ends . An impulse stirred him to tell her she might always count on him . " Sometimes , " he said , " I get tired of working on the same thing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon a married man , so far away . " " Who told you I was married ? " " Mr. Bennet said so . " " Well , I am . I 've got my wife in Montezuma and a baby . " Her hand made a little flutter through the grass . The fingers were pale , slender as new grass leaves . " I ' d feel sorry for a married man . " Jerry found his voice . He looked away for speaking . " You could be a comfort for me  --  if you did n't mind my coming here sometimes to see you . " " I ' d be glad to have you come . It seems I ' m grateful to you . " He watched the shadows growing under the flags , the purpling of the stream . A tanager , like a spark flung from the sunset , darted past their faces . The water sucked hungrily against the banks . The night stole coolly inward . To Jerry in the darkness came some understanding of the man who had bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him afraid ; for she was not afraid , but sat there waiting in her silence . She was not beautiful in the way he thought of beauty  --  she was so small ; but she put keenness in his senses to read her strength . In her slim body was a spark to start the forces moving  --  fires uniting on a single stick , the eddy joining separate streams , the thrust of wind beneath the snow . He was afraid . He said , " The dew ' s begun to form itself . "  | " I like the feeling of it on me . " In the gathered dusk , her face was like an orchid petal . Her dark eyes were large , and the lashes were shadows ; and as she looked at him he felt as if he looked into a well at night , his eyes swimming with the darkness , until he saw the reflection of stars on the water , but so far away he could not tell whether he looked up or down . He felt his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We ' d best go back to Corbal 's . " She made no answer . But when she rose to her feet , her body was light in lifting . Her hands fluttered against his sleeves like pale moths ; but when they touched his hands he felt them warm and dry , and the strength in them . Corbal 's wife was placing supper on the table . A squat little woman , with brown , wrinkled features . She did not speak to them ; it was as if she had not been aware of them at all . But the miller , with his hands red from washing , greeted them heartily . " Come and set , boy . Kin to Ike Bennet is always welcome here , be they he or she . There ' s lobbered milk for ye and cinnamon for sprinkling and corn pancake for sopping it . Lobbered milk is easy to a dusty throat . " He squared his elbows and ate noisily , breathing upon each mouthful . The girl occupied her place becomingly . She kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miller . Her appetite was frugal . Watchingher stolid brown face , Jerry wondered whether she carried Indian blood . It was a strange meal , taken so in utter silence . But the slovenly kept kitchen was cool and dry , and the door was tight against mosquitoes . When he was done , Corbal sighed and pushed himself away from table . " That wheat I ground to-day smelled colicsome . Bottom-land growing . I argued against Dan Ledyard many ' s the time . " He shook his head . " He ' 11 have an ailing family this winter . " He made the remark at his wife as if he expected no answer . He stroked his beard , patting out small clouds of mill dust . He did not look at either of them . " Any time you ' re wishful to come visiting , boy , you ' re welcome . " He stamped through a door . They heard his bed strings creak , his boots thud on the floor . A wooden clock ticked steadily . The woman gathered up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumped them in . She washed them stolidly . When she was done she looked at them . Her eyes were black and lustreless against the light . She said , " Good night , " with surprising clearness ; then she followed her husband . They had gone so suddenly that Jerry had had no decent chance to take his leave . He stared across at Norah . She was sitting at the table still , her hands folded in her lap . Her face was calm , her cheeks smooth , pink and white ; the blackness of her hair was almost stormy . Then she raised her eyes . Her small mouth smiled . " Just like that every night . First him , then her . " Jerry said , " She ' s strange-appearing . " " Yes . " The frankness of her eyes on his disturbed him . " But I ' ve gotten used to it . I suppose now it is my turn . I take the candle and go through that door . The stairs are built against the wall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spilling water hushed and roared . Looking at him , she laughed softly . " Good night , Mr. Fowler . Come again sometime . " She left him seated in the darkness . He sat there like a fool , staring at the dark space of the open door . He watched the candlelight creep after her up the stair wall . He saw the cracks in the plaster fade away . He heard her feet move overhead ; he heard them in her shoes ; and then he heard them bare . He swore at himself . Then he got up . He hesitated . His hands felt hot as they groped for his hat . " Mocking of me . Let her stay there . " His hand en/countered his hat brim . He fumbled for the door . He tried to go quietly that she might not hear him . " Leave out of here , you fool . Leave her be . She does n't know . " The cool was against his face . He closed the door behind him . The latch clacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was no candlelight upstairs . He strode out savagely . " Get back , you , Jerry Fowler , and do n't come back or you will be the Lord 's own fool . " He walked away . " You hold to be a decent man . Leave out of her . Blast her , if she mocked you . " The mill was quiet as an empty church ; the dew was heavy on the grass . " Go now , and do n't consider coming back . " He would go now ; but he knew too that he was only serving time . He was afraid . Day after day , the men at the crossing drove their piles . They had to sink a staging to work on , for the piler broke the mud crust and a man would lose his boots in quicksand . They drove two hundred piles . In June they drove two hundred more . The crowns stuck up through the muck like cobble-heads . The sun hung high in the blue sky over them , or they had rains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made miasmatic shimmers in the men 's eyes . They ate into the great stack of piles , dragging them one by one to the edge of what had been the pond with an old , chestfounderedhorse whose lungs rattled in the heat ; they dragged the piles out from solid ground by hand , rolling them through the muck with peavies , and staggered them up to feed to Josey 's beetle jaws . For days on end they seemed forgotten of the world . Mann had left to spend the summer in Canandaigua on the strength of the state 's rental of his mill . Even Bates had had to leave them . They had three cases of fever in the barrack ; and as the men did not get better , they used a Saturday and Sunday to set up a shanty on the brow of the hill where the men could lie looking down at the driving in the muck . They built the shanty out of the lighter timbers that had been stacked to build the ordered wooden aqueduct . A solid structure , it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embankment . The provision wagon came in once a week . But the driver always was anxious to get back again . Sometimes , though , he brought a paper in which they read that boats had come to Montezuma . They read about that for three weeks  --  it had made a deep impression on the editor . The first boats bore the canal commissioners and gentlemenand ladies , and a brass band in blue uniforms . As Bemis read it out to them , they watched the fireflies weaving patterns over the mud flats that had been the mill pond . Water-logged tree trunks and stumps , from whose roots the mud had shrunk in drying , sprawled in monstrous shapes that waited only for a devil 's word to rise and walk . A brass band ! Gentlemen and ladies ! When they came in at evening , they left their shoes outside the door and put their socks in a common tub to soak the mud out . Now and then one of them would make a fuss at mending clothes , for the cook had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew barbering and shaved their heads to make them easier to wash . They saw the shapes of each other 's heads as ivory images ; and all the shapes seemed wrong . There was no tavern in four miles ; so each man kept wage-whiskey in his leather bottle or Hessian wood flask hung on the wall above his bunk , and drank it lying there while Bemis read the paper . A brass band , gentlemen and ladies ! To amuse himself the cook put in a dozen hills of potatoes ; they sprouted quickly . Every day the cook would go out to see how much his potatoes had come up overnight . There was a patch of mallow just beyond the potatoes ; but he never saw the mallow bloom . A blister beetle came one morning out of nowhere to eat the potato vines ; and he brought it in to drown it . But Plute declared that only the most unmissionated cannibal would boil a living beetle in a pot ; he saved its life and kept it under a tumbler next the salt dish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . They whittled lines like sunbeams from the tumbler rim , and Plute with a watch kept time while they laid money on the lines . Whichever heap the beetle pointed to at the tenth minute took the pot . It was a slow game , drawn out like their nerves . . . . They fed the beetle on green leaves  --  until he began ailing . Cosmo Turbe slipped out while the cook was snoring and cut leaves from the potatoes , and for a while it lived on them . But in the end it died . Bugs came overland to infest their bedding . Bedbugs traveled an unconscionable way through wilderness . They got rides on animals ; but they always dropped off at the smell of human meat . Jerry ordered sage because he could find none growing round about , but it took two weeks to get it . The other men hunted out their bugs and passed them on to Bemis 's bed one evening while he tarred the piler . Bemis made easy pickings for a bug . Sometimes they wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Visiting somewheres , maybe . " " Where 's a man to visit here , I ' d like to know ? " " He ' s not a drinking man . " " Not enough to walk eight miles for plain corn liquor . " " We 've got better here , anyway . " " A girl , most likely . " " Where 's a girl , I ' d like to know ? " " Sometime , maybe , when I have got the time , I ' 11 find that out . " They pricked their ears . " It ai n't possible round here . " " A girl . Cosmo and Plute exchanged glances . " You ' re dumb crazy , Andrews . Fowler ' s married . " " What else would he sashay out that way for ? " " His wife ' s a handsome article , I tell you . " " She ' s two days ' walk away unless he rides . He ca n't get back to her . And he ' s been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with it ? " " It ' s hard upon a married man . " The speaker bent his thumbs back , each in turn , and snapped them forward . He had large hands ; in the palm of one an R was burned . It was an old scar , hardly visible , dull grey ; but when he used hot water for his washing , it stood out lividly . He was a runaway redemptioner ; in westward land few people questioned such . He got up slowly , sat him on his bunk , unlaced his boots . " Christ ! It was better breaking stone on the Cumberland . A man could find him a plantation nigger if he could dodge the dogs . " He pulled his shirt off . His red undershirt had stains under the arms , the color of logwood dye . His forearms bulged under their straight black hairing . He stretched himself and yawned ... . All day long Jerry would find his thoughts veering away to Corbal 's . There it seemed like a different earth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had cast loose the anchors . Once , he remembered , before he found his manhood , a camp-meeting had been held near Uniontown . As he walked , the fireflies brought back the scene to him : the torches redly waving , spewing their resinous smoke into the air ; the narrow redemption aisle that led to the exhorter 's pulpit  --  four empty rum kegs from his father 's farm for pillars . The men stood to the right , their faces lean , their hands half closed , their breathing like a steady wind when there was silence . It made a deep impression on a little boy to find men he had seen bending easily to many toils suddenly grown so wooden that their bodies stood like trees . Across the aisle the women 's figures were pliable as grass before the wind of the exhorter 's words ; and under the torches their eyes shone with the unfed fervor of their souls . Jerry remembered little of the afterspell , when the feelings were unleashed to the storms of preachment . Rather he recalled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hollow cheeks , the fine mobility of his eloquential mouth . He had said that the soul of every man or woman was like a boat with sails , and life was like the sea to sail it on , with a wind that blew away from Heaven . The strong soul rowed against the wind , but the weak soul sailed with it . The exhorter 's hands performed a period ; the meeting sighed in expectation of the agonies to come . Then he lifted his face to the sky ; his lean chest swelled ; with all his might he shouted , " Ai n't it so , Peter ? " The woods were breathless ; and from somewhere in the upper branches they heard the deep voice of Peter answering , " Yes , Brother Thompson , you have put it well . " Then the exhorter would begin again to work on their emotions ; and again , at the tantalizing instant , he withdrew his fervor , calling upon a saint : " What do you say to that , Paul ? " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . " Preacher Thompson had a speaking acquaintance with the saints . There was no question of it ; a person could see that he saw them  --  the gift was in his face . As he stole away , Jerry observed Saint Luke wetting his whistle with a bottle ; Saint Luke was in a tree , straddling a branch , and hugging the trunk to his breast , and Jerry thought that his buttocks stuck through his coat tails uncommonly like the buttocks of Preacher Thompson 's lay companion , Arnold Jones . But the picture the old exhorter had drawn of his soul remained with Jerry ; and now as he walked through Corbal 's meadow he felt it as a boat with sails . He entered the mill and touched the miller 's elbow ; and Corbal kicked out the trundle , shook his hand , and shouted against the silence , " Pleased to see you , boy . She said she would be down the meadow " ; or , " She ' s gone , I take it , gathering berries in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ' 11 find her by the creek . She likes it there . " He beat the dust from his loose sleeves and said , " Stay back for supper with us . " Jerry went forth as he had been directed , to find her waiting for him . As he sat and talked to her , the thought occurred to him that she was still awaiting . Her face was calm ; but the blood that moved so close under the dark skin was always ready at a word to blossom . Sometimes she seemed to him like earth too rich for the sowing of plain seed ; and again , her eyes were sad , as if she kept a secret self and it were hungry . She looked so fragile then that he felt that if he could take her in his hands she would bruise like a leaf of maidenhair ; the thought would leave him unprepared for her veering back into her mocking vein , when her small body became vibrantly provocative and her dark eyes tantalized him with a kind of dance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child ... .  | " Where were you born , Norah ? " he asked her one day . She hadbeen gathering late strawberries along the woods edge of the pasture . " I do n't know , Jerry , for a fact ; but I expect it was in the tavern onWood Creek . " " Wood Creek ? The one that passes Rome and runs into Oneida ? " She nodded . " Yes , it was a wild place . Just the tavern . The sign said Jackson 's Tavern . But my father 's name was Ferris . " " I ' ve heard of Jackson 's Tavern on Wood Creek . " " There 's only one , I guess . It tended to the Durham boaters . " Jerry nodded . " That must have been when the Inland Navigation Company was running its locks . " " I do n't know . Ma was terribly fearful of the Durham boaters . " " What was she like , Norah ? " " I guess she was a lot like me . " She took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A drop of red juice formed on her lower lip . She sucked it in , smiled , and offered Jerry the bite from the hull . " She hardly ever spoke . She never chided me for running in the woods . But when a Durham boat came up the creek , she ' d holler for me , if Ferris was n't there , and hide me in a closet . She served them with a shotgun . She was fearful of them . I do n't know why . " " I ' ve heard they were a chancy lot , " said Jerry . Norah shook her head to free her mouth of a bonnet ribbon curled up by the wind . " Some of them looked so , I guess . But some were young . " She munched her berries thoughtfully . " Ferris could never like me somehow . Maybe it was because I was afraid of him . It makes a man cruel if a woman ' s scared of him , I guess . He used to strop me sometimes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancied him . When I was thirteen and he once caught me bad for fair , though , it did n't seem to make a difference to him . " " What was your mother like , Norah ? "  | " She never talked to anybody much . Not even me . She was a silent person , Jerry . " " Where was she born ? " " I do n't know . I 've never heard it . " " It must have been a dreary place . " " It did get dull when the turnpikes opened up and boats got few . I used to be so scared when the boats came through . Ma hid me in under the roof ; but there was a knothole looking into the tap . I remember crawling out and watching boaters drink . It made me fearful to see Ma so fearful and I ' d hold my breath . But I was curious to see what they would look like . Once one looked up and met my eye . He was young and looked away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She sorted over the berries in her lap . " I mind when I was just a little girl a boat came down from Rome with gentry in it . One of them had a uniform , and one was very young and stood up straight . Ma talked to him a little . His name was Mr. Clinton , or something like it . They did n't sleep inside , but had a fire down beside the creek . " " When did you run away , Norah ? " " Oh , I do n't know . Some time ago . It was in spring and I had been out fishing in the woods . It seemed to me it was a shame to go back home . When I looked up and seen the tavern in the dark and Ferris in the tap awaiting for me , I just took his skiff and lit out down the creek . Then I landed and got out and walked south through the woods . I came out on a farm . There was a young surveyorthere ; and since then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes looked slantwise toward him . " Now I ' m here , " they seemed to tell him . Jerry fingered a loose callus in his hand . She sighed a little . " It scarcely seems as if I ' d been brought up . It seems there ' s only just one thing I know to do . And sometimes I feel sad . " Jerry 's heart hammered . " What do you like the most in all the world , Norah ? " She gave him her little tingling smile ; but suddenly her eyes dark- ened ; she put her bonnet back from her head and let the evening wind blow on her face . " I ' d like to hear a sermon . There 're no camp-meetings round about here , are there , Jerry ? " " I do n't know . " " I ' d like sometime to hear a meeting and an exhortation . The exhortation is the best there is to hear . " Her voice became abstract . " When there 's a powerful exhorter I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my toes . It ' s like what I suppose deliverance is to a woman . " Her voice broke down . " I 've never been gifted to confess myself . Jerry , have you ever confessed in public meeting ? " Her mouth was trembling and her eyelids uncertain : she looked ready to cry . " I always go if I 'm opportuned to it . Hoping . But it never comes . Jerry , I think if you could take me sometime , maybe I could . You 've been so good to me . You ' re a good man , Jerry . I have never felt so good toward anyone before . Maybe I could . " She put her hands on his knees . " Jerry , if one should hold hereabouts , would you take me to it ? " " Surely , Norah . If you want it . " He saw her black eyes melting . The wind was drawing from the south . It had a cool touch on the hot , dry meadow ; it combed the grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bells of columbines . It brought no clouds , but it was soft with rain . . . . " You had a key in your hand " SHE had strange ways . He never knew how next she would approach him . One day she asked him , " Jerry , what ' s the most beautiful thing you ever saw ? "  | He tried to think as they walked together along the creek . But she had ceased seeking his answer . She said : " The most beautiful thing I ever saw was when I ran away from home . I landed on the south shore of the creek at night , and walked all night till I was tired . I slept under a pine tree  --  and in the morning the sun woke me by heat upon my eyelids . I opened them and saw an apple tree blooming in the middle of the woods . " He said : " That must have been beautiful . " She was walking with bent head and her voice was soft . She said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm outhere by myself , listening to your piler striking down the valley , itcomes back to me . It was so still that morning that you could hardly trace a petal 's falling . Why do you suppose I think of it ? " He said : " I do n't know , Norah . " For a while she walked with her eyes lost . Then she lifted her face to his . She had to lift her chin to see his face . She said : " Can you think why , Jerry ? " He said : " No . " " But I know why , Jerry . I thought of it just now . " Her eyes were glad , like a child 's . " But I ' m not going to tell you , so do n't ask me , please . " " I wo n't ask it if you do n't wish it , Norah . " Her voice grew tender . " Thank you , Jerry . Very much . Because if you were set and minded to find out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ' s the first thing of my own I ' ve ever had .... " She was a strange girl , because she could not bear to be touched ; when they walked , even if they were out of sight of Corbal 's , she would not let him take her hand . But she would play around him with her words . " Jerry , how do you love me best ? " He flushed , as she stood off , tilting her face up at him . " You wo n't say , will you , Jerry ? "  | " Why do you want to know ? " She seemed to bubble at him , but her eyes were sly . " Do you want to know how I love you the best , Jerry ? " " How ? " She shook her head . " It ' s not a decent time to tell you . You ' re too slow . Why were you so slow with me , Jerry ? " He made no answer . " You looked at your two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't help it . Tell me that . " She shook her head again : " No , you 've told me by your face . " She came stealing up to him , standing quite close , on tiptoe . " Am I mean to pester you , Jerry ? Does it matter ? Us alone ? We have found some comfort . It ' s not wrong . " He said harshly : " Have you ever seen a mare , Norah ? " " Yes . She is afraid of being beautiful . She trembles . " " Yes . Did you ever see a doe who ' s heard an answer ? " " Yes , I ' ve seen a doe . . . . She is a humble thing . . . . It makesher meek . " " Or a vixen , all sleek , and knowing all there is ? " " No . I ' ve never seen a vixen , Jerry . " " Even the vixen does n't turn her head . " Her laughter pealed through the leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jerry , because I look at you ? " She looked into his lean , dark face . She saw his eyes grow harder . Her laughter softened , and she touched his hand . " Is it unbecoming , Jerry ? " .. . It surprised him to hear her sing . Her voice lost clearness when she sang ; it was husky then , and had unexpected depth . One day he found her alone . He had come up to Corbal 's on a Saturday afternoon when the piler needed greasing and the gang had struck off early . Corbals were away in Victor , and she was alone in the kitchen carding whole wool for the miller 's wife . He heard her voice when he came past the dam.  | " Why is red the rose 's dyeThat it may seem thy blushes ' hue ? All that ' s fair by love 's decree Has been made resembling thee . " The comb was idle in her hand , the fleece like a billowed cloud to rest her feet . " Why is falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? All that ' s fair ... " After that she sometimes sang for him . She liked soft songs that required a small range for her voice . " Just like love is yonder rose , Heavenly fragrance round it throws , Yet tears its dewy leaves disclose , And in the midst of briers it blows . " She was singing it to him . " And when rude hands the twin buds sever They die and they shall blossom never . Yet the thorns are sharp as ever , Yet the thorns are sharp as ever . " She let the carding comb drop into the fleece . Her wet eyes lifted to his . Sometimes she cried easily ; and at such times it seemed to him that he could trace more plainly where the welt had been laid on across her face . But to-day it had nearly vanished ; and when she said , " Jerry , do n't you know that that ' s what ' s going to happen to us  --  you a married man , and me ? " a queer little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to stay here ? She 's got along the way she wished without money up to this time . Why does she want to stay ? " But she said , " I feel like a different person here , Jerry . I feel so good that I feel bad . It ' s you make me feel different , I guess , because I never felt the same before , "  | He said , gruffly , " There ' s no need for feeling different . " " I do . I do , now , when you say that but wo n't look at me . " She took up the comb again and began idly carding . " Is it a sin ? It is ; but it 's a comfort to you . Is it a sin for me , then ? To repay you with comforting ? Have n't I brought you what you never had ? " Her little hands became savage on the fleece . " Then why ? " " I do n't know . I wish I did . It do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " It ' s in you . " She pointed her finger . " Stop it ! " he shouted . " Shut that everlasting clap , ca n't you ? I ca n't stand it . What difference does it make to you ? It never has . " She seemed to withdraw upon her stool . He got up and walked out of the door . He put his hands in his pockets and walked resolutely . " Jerry . " He would not look round . " Please , Jerry . " Breathlessly . Her feet were running after him along the grassy track . He would not hurry , nor would he slow . " Jerry , what ' ve I been saying ? It do n't count . There ' s me , is n't there ? Here . All of me , Jerry . " She was not beautiful , the way he had thought to look at beauty . She stood close under his chin with her head bent , her hands hanging , the palms of her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her skirt . The hair grew high on the back of her neck , from a little point , and the ends curled like grapevine tendrils . . . . Corbal looked back again at Norah . His stiff , square beard had been brushed free of flour for his trip to town . He wore his madderyellowlinsey shirt with the green worsted scarf for a belt ; and now he was downing his malt brew . They had had a stew of bass for their supper , done with leeks and pork and sour milk  --  a dish his wife knew . " No , " said Corbal . " I do n't know if there ever was a campmeetinghereabouts . " He squared his elbow to the table and lifted his pewter . " I do n't hold with public prayer . Religion is bad for a man ; it turbulates his blood , making it too hot for him ; it ' s like running stones too long without no wheat for them to bite on . If a man becomes interested in religion , pretty soon he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thins the blood in him like ague or the intermittentfever . There are such , but I ca n't stand for them . They feel the need of wheat like any stone , and look around for other people 's . No , I do n't know that there is going to be camp-meeting hereabouts . " He looked at the girl not unkindly . " Of course , " he said , " I would n't set myself against a preacherwedden . Not that I regard it ' s necessary . Me and my old lady there got joined without no minister . I just laid out some dollars in a pair of breeches for her pa , a length of French calico to suit her ma 's complexion , a Sutherland muskit , and a barrel of prime Devereux . We ' ve got along right good . " His wife was clearing up the supper table , her short , stolid figure heedless as a deaf woman 's . " With women , now , perhaps it ' s different . I ' m not a man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say . " He got up for his nightly passage to his room . He closed the door , sat on his bed , and threw his boots on the floor . The bed strings creaked . Coming up behind Norah , Mrs. Corbal touched her shoulder . It was so unexpected that Jerry as well as Norah jumped . Mrs. Corbal 's face was smiling down at them . She had an air of secret pride . She put her thumb against her breast and nodded at them . " Me  --  Christian woman . " " Oh , " said Norah . " Yes . " She nodded . " Camp-meeting comes next month . " Norah 's face lit up . " Where ? "  | The woman lowered her voice . " Corbal does n't like it . I go every year . Beyond Pittsford . This side Rochester . By Little Stone Brook crossing . In Henslow 's woods . " She smiled at them . Her broad , high cheek-bones made her face look moonish . " I go , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her bedroom door , her dark red-brown eyes were mystic . Norah said : " Oh , Jerry ! Can I go ? " " Why , yes . " " Will you take me ? " He said , " I do n't know how the work will be then . We are getting on . I ' m laying the flooring on the southward end . " " Promise me it will be done so you can go . " He smiled into her eyes . " I will if I can get away . " " I would n't want to take you off the work , if you did n't want to come , Jerry . But I want to go . Oh , I want to go . I feel it in me . As if I had a string to pull me . I can feel it even now . Already . " " We ' 11 go . " " Oh , Jerry , you ' re so good . " She moved over to the miller 's stool to sit beside him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She sat quite still ; but Jerry felt as if the palm in his were singing . " Jerry . " She whispered . " To me it ' s like your work for you . " " It looks as if it meant a lot more to you than my work does to me . " " It ' s similar . I feel it . As if I could do things if once I could confess . Maybe with you along I could . " He was glad to see her happy , but in himself he felt a staleness . " It ' s funny , Norah . But since I ' ve come here my work do n't stand for much with me . It seems I ' m sick of it . It does n't matter . " " It does . You will be rich by it . Men will look up at you . Men will say , when everything is done , He did that crossing . He made that lock . "  | " It does n't seem to matter any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do what I ' m told . Norah , I feel as if I ' m looking somewhere for something . Something in me is unloosed and questing . It seems as if I heard littler things , as if I could smell new smells . But I do n't care for working any more . I used to take a joy for feeling a hammer in my hand . " " You 've never shown me your work , Jerry . " " I ' 11 take you down on Monday if you want to see it . " " Monday afternoon . " " In the evening when the men are inside the shanty . " " I want to see it . I want to know every last thing you do , Jerry . . . . " " Jerry , when you are that way , I feel as if my hands had turned to vines . Have you ever cut a grapevine and seen the sap come out of it ? My fingers feel like every one a broken vine . " " It ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s early yet . Jerry , I could n't bear for us to part now . Rightful or wrongful , I could n't bear it . " " We do n't have to . " " We will soon . I can feel it . Jerry , to-night I thought you would n't ever come . I felt as if I walked in a strange town . And the watch found me and put me in the jail for vagranting . My body felt like vagranting . And they put me in the mill to make me humble and the jail matron beat me till I trod it . " " You were dreaming , Norah . " " Yes , it was a dream . I dreamed it . And then they took me out when I had trod the necessary hours . And my feet were sore . They put me into a cell , on the floor , and left me there . And I felt the time in my feet , the time of waiting . In the soles of my feet . I felt it mounting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air and light . But I did n't feel humble , for I heard you coming . And you opened the jail with a key , Jerry . You had a key in your hand and you turned it in the door and I smelled apple blossoms . " " It ' s time I went . "   " Do you ever smell the apple tree ? " " It does n't seem so . " " Jerry , did you ever lie in grass upon your back and watch clouds go over your head with the sunlight in the wind behind them ? " " Corbal will be getting up . " " Not yet , Jerry . Lie still . " " He will be wakening now . " " He never hears . His head is like grinding millstones . " " Mrs. Corbal , then . " " She does n't care . " " Norah , I 've got to go . I 've got a two-mile walk for work . " " There ' s time , Jerry . Lie back . Did a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jerry laughed . " No , not anyone at sunrise . " " I do n't mean that . With the sleep all white on your skin . " He forced himself to go . " Jerry . . . . " " The sun sets in the lap of God " " You must speak soft , Norah . " " Is that where you live ? " " Yes . In the barrack . The kitchen ' s on this end . " " And that 's where the men sleep ? " " Yes . You can see them through the window . Now let 's go down , if you want to look at the work . " " What are those , Jerry ? " " Those ? Oh , the piles . We 've drove eight hundred of them now . The driving 's nearly done . That ' s the engine . " " That big thing ? " " Yes . "  | Their shapes stole softly out on the plank floor of the crossing . Norah laid her hand against a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sniffed her fingers . He heard herbreath thin and shivery . " What 's on it ? It ' s all over it . " " Tar oil . We have to keep the tracks greased or there ' d be fire . " " It smells awful . " " I ' m sorry . I should have told you . " " I ' d like to see it work . I ' d like to see it driving down a pile . " Her voice was vibrant . She touched it again with her finger-tips . " It ' s in me , the sound of it . Driving all day long . I ' d like tosee it piling on a log . Driving it down . " " It ' s not much to see . " " The sound of it is hurtful . " " Stand back in the shadow , Norah . " " Why ? " " Quick . Unless you want to get found . " " What would happen ? " " Stand there . Do n't talk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grip tightened , till he felt her wince . A bar of light was put forth from the shanty as the door opened . A gust of voices came forward with it . One of the men was singing . " The dogs began to bark , And I peeped out to see , A handsome young man a-hunting ; But he was not hunting me . " They could not see who sang . But Jerry recognized the two figures in the doorway . " That ' s Andrews , " he whispered . " He ' s a redemptioner  --  runaway , I guess . " The two men stepped out into the edge of night and were lost . Norah was very still . Then she whispered , " Who 's the other one ? "  | " He ' s a cobbler . His name is Harley Falk . He made a pair of shoes for Cosmo Turbe . " " Oh . " " What are you shivering for ? " " It 's the damp . It must be hard to work in the damp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get sick of it . " " Shh . They ' re coming back . The cobbler ' s going away . See his white horse . " " Do you know him ? " " Shh . Softer , Jerry . No . " " What are you feared of ? You were bold enough two minutes past . " The voice of the man who was singing carried tonelessly towards them . He sang as if even his song made no difference . " Do you know that cobbler ? " Jerry asked suddenly . " No . " " Then what are you frightened of ? " " The head of the horse , Jerry . When he crossed the door . Did you see it ? The light in his eyes ? " " He 's a blind white horse . " " Yes . White ! " Her hand fluttered in his . They were still . Falk was in his wagon and he now drove it down the road beyond the barrack . Andrews walked beside the wheel . They stopped out of hearing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices came in snatches . " Find out , then , " said Falk . " I ' d like to know what he ' s doing . " " I 've already found out pretty well . There 's a girl at Corbal 's . " " Oh . What about her ? " " That ' s to ask . It ' s pretty plain , I 'd say . But I aim to get the particulars . " " Well , I ' m glad to know . You can have the particulars . " " Where are you going now ? " " Back to Montezuma. "  | " Well , it ' s your own business . " The wagon moved off down the road . One of its wheels needed greasing . Norah and Jerry by the piler , Andrews by the corner of the barrack , listened to its going . For a long time it seemed to make no progress through the darkness . Then the sound of it went out . Andrews moved slowly to the door . He lingered there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held their breaths . But at last a voice shouted :  --  " Shut that door , ca n't you ? You 've let in half the bugs in MonroeCounty . " He went in . " Let ' s go back , " Norah whispered . " Quick , Jerry . " " He ' s gone in . It ' s all right now . " " Jerry , come quick . " She urged him with her hands ; she was like a moth in the darknessbeating him with hands for wings . " Jerry , please . " He humored her ; but as they walked along the road , the warm summer air became bleak in his face . What was Harley Falk talking about ? There was something wrong with that man . He ' d scarcely noticed him round the barrack these last three days ; he never talked to him . " What does he want to know about me for ? " he thought . And then he remembered how he had warned Mary that he did n't like the cobbler . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to puzzle it ; but the road kept swimming up to meet him . " You acted just as if you knew him . " " I did n't . Honestly . I was afeared . " " But you were n't afraid when we went down . " " I was afeared when I saw his horse . The white eyes . They looked right at me . Jerry , I felt all naked in that horse 's eyes . " He laughed shortly . " Well , you ' re all right now . " They were coming out in Corbal 's meadow . The mill roof was frosted with a silver dew , the pond a looking-glass for stars . She drew a long breath.  |  " Yes . I feel safer here . With you along , Jerry . " She kept the path beside him , pressing against him . She turned her face below his shoulder and looked up . Her face was pointed by the starlight , her eyes dark . " What 's the matter , Jerry . You 're troubled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ' m sorry . " " Was he the man that left you in the cabin ? " He thought he could see even in the dimness the line across her face . " No . No . " She laughed . " I must have had a silly on me . And you are silly to mind it . Look . Corbals are asleep . " " No . I ' m going back . " " No , do n't . It ' s unhealthy there . " " I ' m going back . " " You act so strange . " " I feel queer . " " Oh , please come in . Come in and see me upstairs through the dark . " " No . " She pleaded silently . " Go on in , Norah . " She gave a little sigh . " Jerry , you ' re not mad with me ? You ' 11 still take me down to Henslow 's woods ? " " Yes , yes , yes . Anything . But go to bed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . He heard her light steps slowly mount to her room . Then he started back along the path . It was dark in the woods . The lights in the shanty were out when he came into the Irondequot Valley . He waited a moment beside the crossing frame , for he felt very tired . " Hello , Mr. Fowler . " A man moved out from the shadow of the kitchen end.  | " What are you doing up so late , Andrews ? " " Calomel night  --  against the ague . " He chuckled softly . " You look as if you ' d better have some . " " I ' ve not caught it . " " It ' s a fine night out , ai n't it ? When it gets late the bugs fly back into the woods . A man can take his comfort . " " It ' s a nice night . " Men were snoring in the barrack . A wave of human scent drew past Jerry . He stole across to his bunk and stretched himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turbe rise up on his elbow , watch Andrews enter , and nudge Plute . They whispered . Jerry thought , " Everyone talks secret here . " But he did n't care . " Mr. Bates , I want to get away . Ca n't you get someone else to finish here ? " " What ' s the matter , Fowler ? You ' 11 finish up next month . " " I ' m sick of it . " Mr. Bates looked at him dryly . " I guess we all get sick of it in spells . Four years of mauling through this country makes anybody sick . You 're no worse off than the rest of us . " " My wife ' s expecting , " Jerry said lamely . " I did n't know that , Jerry . When ? " Jerry hung his head . " October . " Bates laughed shortly . " That ' s time enough . It ' s your second , is n't it ? " " Yes , but . . . " " We 've all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A month at most . Hang on . Look here , boy . I could stay here if I had to , but that would keep me off the rest of my line . It would mean a month redoubled in time lost . Just because you got panicky . This thing is too damned ticklish for us to do that . They ' re feeling very chancy down in Albany . Especially now , because we 've got their agree/ment for an earth embankment . Stone 's ordered already . The southern tier of noodles are just waiting for a chance to stop us , now , God damn them ! " " Who ' s going to lay it up ? " " That perks you up , eh ? " " Who ? " " I do n't know . One man has given better figures than any we 've had . He ' s coming up here soon . If we 've got the flooring done it will encourage him . I think he 's some friend of Dancer Borden 's down in Galen . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated Jerry . " Listen . You think you 're getting a hard deal here . Think of old Geddes tramping through this country ten years ago . Wild woods most of it . But he cleared every foot of it for his levelsights . He wore a bucket on his back with a smudge in it to keep off the bugs . He did n't even have a tent . And you complain . Fowler , if you quit on me , I 'll spread it all around . " " Go ahead . What 's to prevent me walking right out any time ? " " Not a thing . Go on . Get out . " Jerry stared at the flooring he was laying . His arms felt dead . His wrists were overthick . His forehead bothered him as if his hatband had been cast in lead . His fists were like balls . But on the piler winch , Cosmo Turbe was bawling , " Active , Plute ! Real active ! " And Bemis stood with his hammer ready to tip up the paul . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . The shock came through the flooring against Jerry 's feet and jarred him to his teeth . But Bemis rubbed his hands and judged the inches . " Just a little way , boys . " They let the hammer fall a short one . " Dainty , " said Plute . " It ' s leveled dainty , Mr. Bemis . " And Bemis said with a kind of modest twitch of his important buttocks , " Shucks . I could drive a feather with her , without bend or break . " " I ' 11 stay , Mr. Bates . ' " Good boy .... "  | " I 've been away a considerable , ai n't I , Jerry ? " Issachar Bennet grinned at him . " You have n't changed horses anyway , " said Jerry . " No . I 've got fond of Daisy . Say , you do n't look very well . " " I feel queer , " Jerry admitted . " Well , come on up to Corbal 's to-night . " " Yes , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ? " " I 've been there right along . Too often , maybe . " Bennet sympathetically clacked his tongue . " She ' s fine , though . " Bennet looked out over the work . His hatchet face was wrinkled with distaste . " It ' s quite a job by the look of it , Jerry . " " I ' m sick to death of it . " " I do n't wonder . I could n't stand working in one place . I had to quit on my last congregation . Baptists . It ' s hard being Baptist .  --  keeping dry . " His eyes twinkled in the tiny wrinkles . " But I done so good I did n't think they ' d let me go until I promised to preachify at the camp-meeting . " " You 're going ? " " Well , I 've passed my word . The rest lies in the Lord . " " Norah is possessed to go . I said I ' d go along with her . " " We might travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s going to be a mighty time . " He gathered up the reins . " Well , I ' 11 push on , and you come up to-night . " Jerry quit work at sundown . The last pile was in and the cribbinglacked but a few timbers . It was good , stout workmanship . Old Josey had been hauled up on the bank with tackles , and now she lay collapsed ; as though with her last blow her soul had given out . He carried his tools to the barrack . The cook brought out his basin of hot water . He stripped himself and washed by the sunnyp354doorway . The men were sprawling on the ground , waiting for supper . " How much longer are we going to be here , Mr. Fowler ? " " Only a few days more . " Jerry lathered himself with the yellow bar and scrubbed his hands and face . He rubbed himself all over with a coarse towel . His skin felt dry and full of tiny pricks . " Plute ? " Plute looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I ' m going to be away over the Sunday . I put you in charge . Some of the men are going to get restless . " Plute grinned . " A couple of them might . Can I have Cosmo for my leftenant ? " " Anyone you like . " He smiled at Cosmo 's flat frog 's grin . He was getting fond of these two men . " What do you want us to do , Mr. Fowler ? " " There ' 11 be Josey to load on for Bemis . I do n't know where he ' s going with it , but he leaves to-morrow . Then stack the other piles . And after that you can dig out the earth on either side of the flooring . Level it flush with the floor level . You wo n't strike quicksand . " " Sure , " said Plute . The boys hate digging . But we ' 11 get it done in no time , wo n't we , Cosmo ? " Cosmo nodded . " Real active . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combed back his hair , and put his razor in his pocket . The men still sprawled before the door . " Oh , Plute , if Bates brings orders to move on the gang , you can let ' em go . Do n't argue with him . But you two might as well stay . " He walked along the track . An unearthly stillness in the evening woods bore down upon him . The cicadas had cut of their shrilling a little while ago ; but his ears still buzzed with them . He tried top355clear his head of dizziness . As he walked , all his senses stretched before him for the coolness of Corbal 's quiet valley . This was the kind of evening on which , if she felt kind , Norah would soothe and comfort him . He longed to get to her , but he could not hurry . And he wondered if Bennet 's being there would bother her . He felt himself that nothing in the world could bother him . He wondered if she would come to meet him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned down for the meadow , he lifted his eyes to see if she was sitting on the beech-tree stump . He saw her there . But she was not sitting . Small and birdlike she stood upon the stump , and two gentlemen on horseback were talking down at her . They had their hats in their hands . Jerry 's eyes took in the horses . They were blooded beasts , one bay , one black . They tossed their double bits and moved their forefeetlightly ; and the low slanting sunlight dappled their shining hides with leaf-marks . Jerry looked up at the men 's faces . One he had never seen ; but he who talked to Norah sat his beast with indolent grace . And in his oval face and possessive eyes Jerry ' s tired head found something familiar . Then the man laughed clearly , so that his horse moved under him and had to be reined back with a wrist of dovelike steel . But Jerry placed the laugh . " Go lightly , " it seemed to say . " Look about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightly . " He felt the blood in his face resenting Norah 's answering mirth . She laughed with a clear , light passion of excitement ; her small red lips opened ; her body seemed to lift and sway ; and Jerry saw the faintest flush in Dancer Borden 's olive cheek as he made a bow . Borden 's companion was a square-faced man with a rusty beard trimmed close . His cold discerning eyes spied Jerry first . His horse slid imperceptibly sidewise and he touched Borden 's elbow with a gloved forefinger . Dancer Borden and Norah turned together . Her face was flushed bright pink ; her mouth still quivered half demurely ; but her eyes were flashing black.  | " Oh , Jerry , I was waiting for you . " " I ' m a little late , " he said in a dull voice . But he looked at Dancer Borden . Borden 's eyes traveled from him to Norah and returned to him . He reached down to hold out a slim , gloved hand . " It ' s the carpenter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How are you , Fowler ? " Half the greeting seemed an explanation for his companion . Jerry looked over to the cold eyes and was surprised to find them understanding . " I ' ve seen your work . " He did not offer to shake hands . " It ' s good work . " That was all he said , but his eyes twitched toward Norah . Norah stood at Jerry 's side , and Dancer Borden gracefully curved his mount to face them both . " We were talking as we came along , " he explained . " And our horses chose this path before we noticed . This lady has been setting us right . " He made a bow . " Thank you . " He spoke to his companion . " We ought to move along , if you ' re going to meet Bates there to-night . " Both men doffed their hats again . Their little spurs stabbed at their horses . They cantered off  --  straight-backed ; one wore blue and one wore green . The dust rose up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold and green upon their flanks . Jerry felt Norah 's hand upon his wrist . " Oh , I ' m glad you 've come . " Her small face was lifted towards him . Her cheeks were glowing . Her eyes looked longer ; and the lids half veiled them . Her voice was vibrant . " I waited and waited and I thought you ' d never come , Jerry . " " Has Issachar Bennet got here ? " he asked heavily . " Yes . He came a little while past noon . He ' s been talking with Corbal . He 's a nice old man , I think . He ' s fond of you , Jerry . " " Did he tell you of the camp-meeting ? "  | " Yes . He said he was going down . He said he ' d take us . " She put her hands together before her dress , and her eyes sparkled . She had strange ways , he thought . " Oh , Jerry . I ' m so glad . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel tired , Jerry ? " Her voice was kind . His heart lifted a little . She would be kind . " Yes , I feel tired to-night . " " Let 's sit a while , here on the bridge . It ' s cool here and I like to sit close to the water when it ' s still this way . Look , Jerry , you can see the lizards swimming in the weeds . That red one , and there ' s one with spots like little gold currencies all over him . I ' ve heard that trout get spots from eating lizards . " The pond was glass-like . It did not feel the lightest wind ... . But the arrowheads along the shallows quivered in the water 's motion . " Are you awfully tired , Jerry ? " He mumbled , " I ' m kind of tired . " " Here , put your arm acrosss my shoulders . It gives you something to lean upon , small if it is . Jerry , I 've been thinking how good you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Underneath his arms , against his ribs , he could feel her shivering . " What are you trembling about ? " " Nothing , Jerry . I ' m not trembling . " " Yes , you are . " " Silly . " She slid her hand between their sides . " It ' s your own heart beating . " " It is n't me . " He felt again the small ecstatic shivering under his arm . " Why do you do it , Norah ? " She laughed softly , hanging her head and looking at the water . " I ' m excited . I keep thinking of camp-meeting , Jerry . You and me . Oh , it would please me so to be gifted with confession . Jerry , I can feel it pulling in me . Like a string I ' m led by . " She looked straight over the water to the west . The lower edge " Is that Scripture ? " " It ' s out of Jeremiah , the prophet . " " Well he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago did he say that thing , Ike ? " " A long time ago , Nathan . Three thousand years , maybe . " " To think of that ! Him way back in the Jerusalem-land , seeing me here . Me , Nathan Corbal , in the town of Victor , Monroe County , York State , in America . " He rubbed a dusty cloud out of his head . " He was a prophet all right . Now if he was in a camp-meeting , maybe I ' d go to it . " " They do n't come like that nowadays , Nathan . " " Well , he did n't say nothing about Anna , did he ? What she goes a-hunting after ? " " Not that I know of , Nathan . " " Well , that ' s it . For four days now , I ' ve got to eat cold vittles . I do n't mind that . It ' s cleaning of the dishes wears a man down , though . It puts a frailty in me just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made his nightly passage to his room . Bennet grinned at them . " It ' s just as well he never got to camp-meeting to hear his wife confess . " " Does she ? " asked Norah . " Oh , yes . She ' s got the gift . If I could exhort as powerful as she confesses , I ' d not be traipsing backwoods circuits . I ' d be setting in my coach in Albany or Philadelphia or even in Boston . " " I 've never been gifted to confess , " said Norah , earnestly . " It ' s a kind of habit once it starts . I would n't worry now if I was you . It seems to me a person will have to do it all over again once he ' s dead . " He grinned . " But Anna she ' 11 confess the most remarkable things . She will confess how she has lived in sin with Corbal . Things that would make him die to hear . Things that never got into his deaf head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 11 shake ; she 'll swound and then get up and scream she 's been bedfellow of the Devil . One time she did confess to murdering Nathan . That was so remarkable , we kept an eye on her and sent someone backp361here . He found Nathan crying here because he was lonesome for her . Of course we did n't let on . Exhorters get her now to lead the way . " His birdlike chuckle filled the room . " Norah . " He spoke softly . He would not wake her if she was asleep . A breeze drew through the tiny windows , filling the low-ceilinged room with the damp , cool breath of sifting rain . The eaves dripped slowly . He heard drops falling on the kitchen doorstone . First one drop ; then a pause ; then two in close succession . Drip  --  drip , drip . Over and over . The sound of the spillway lulled him . In the rain it was inarticulate , gentle , hushed . " Norah . " He had never thought before how easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , he could see faintly the curve the ceilingmade to meet the eaves . In Uniontown the room he and his older brother used to share had such a ceiling , bending down to the window-tops , so that the night air flowed in like a stream , level with one 's sleeping body . " Norah . " It seemed to Jerry that a scent of roses stole through the rain ; but there were no roses in Corbal 's valley . A wild rose likes light soil . He had seen them cover the cinder heaps beside blast furnaces . There were no roses anywhere near Corbal 's , but the scent was sweet . Thought of her was like a fragrance in his being . He could hardly stir for fear the fragrance would be gone . In all the weeks they had known each other , he had not felt so deeply moved as he was now . She had had the excitement of the afternoon to offer him . " Norah . " He could not bear to be alone . He lay still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drip , drip . There was no wind ; there was no sound of rain upon the roof . Drip  --  drip , drip.  |p362Gradually  he woke to a perception of the world asleep . He could not hear her breathing . He turned suddenly in the bed and put his hand between the blanket and the tick . Her place was empty . Drip  --  drip , drip . He felt of the tick , his finger-tips grown sensitive . It was still warm , and bit by bit he traced the shape her body had left in the feathers . " Norah . " He waited for her to return . He seemed to doze and wake and doze . Then , in a period when his senses were alert , he became aware that the fragrance of roses was a thing he must have dreamed . The room was empty and her place was growing cold . There was no sound in the house . No sound outside the window but the drip of the eaves ' drops on the kitchen stone . He put his bare feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his trousers and slid them on . His shirt felt damp and cool upon his back ; his shoes were stiff to his feet . He went down softly to the kitchen , stepped over the board that creaked , and listened . Through their closed doors he heard Corbal and the preacher sleeping evenly . But the kitchen door was open and the drops struck on the stone with little barbs of sound . " Norah , " he whispered . He was afraid . His heart was empty . His skull felt thin as paper from the pain inside his head . The rain was drifting on the valley . It made no earthly sound . It did not fall . It seemed to hang like a veil that he could put his hand against , that he could strike with his fist , that was too light to break . The water at the mill slid down with a hushed frail sound like laughter . " Do go lightly . " The filled buckets on the wheel caused it to sway and it creaked faintly on the spindle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round his voice . It muffled his lips . Jerry began to run.  |p363His  feet should know the track . He thought as he ran , " I ' ve traveled it often enough by dark to know it now . " He walked when he thought the corduroy was due ; and at the first stride it was there . It made him bitter . She could n't leave him now . It was not possible . She had been so set on going to camp-meeting . She wanted to confess . The urge was in her ; she said it pulled her like a string . She ' d said that if he went she thought she could confess . And he was going . He had promised her to go . She would not have run off ; it was not possible . Why , Dancer Borden could not have spoken half a dozen words to her before his friend . It was not possible . Something had happened to her . Sometimes she had gone outside at night to walk . Sometimes he had gone with her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road , and then she had come back . To-night , with the spirit of confession strong within her , she had wanted her time alone . She had walked down to the Victor road . But it was raining and she hated rain . Dew she loved ; but rain she could not bear . She would be cold to him when he came upon her . She would not speak as they walked back to Corbal 's . She would seem small , and chilled , and her being would be withdrawn where his blundering could not reach it . But his feet took him doggedly ahead . He must know . They sludged upward to the Victor road . He stood still there , listening . The rain drifted through the leaves . Its drip was hushed between the roots . There was no sound but the dry labor of his heart . A stick broke behind him . He whirled to meet two outthrust arms . Jerry smelled the man 's strong scent . The muck odor in his clothes was unmistakable . " I guessed you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in . The hands slipped up upon his shoulders . " Leave go , " said Jerry . The man swore.  | He dropped his hands and stepped back . " Who are you ? " The man spoke up surly . " What difference ? " " Andrews , are n't you ? " " What if I be ? " " What are you doing here ? " " What difference ? " " Tell me , blast you . " The man stepped forward . Jerry could see him looming in the rain . " Listen , cocky . I do n't take no more orders from you . I came here to meet a girl , see ? I ' ve had my eyes on her some time . " The rain stuck Jerry 's shirt against his shoulders . " Did you see her ? " he asked quietly . Andrews laughed shortly . " Not exactly to see her . She skun out of my hands . I do n't exactlyknow . I caught my toe on a God-damned root . I took out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My ankle smarted me . So I come back . I thought she ' d come back sometime . " " Which way did she go ? " " One way or another  --  how ' d I know ? " " Which way ? " Jerry 's voice rose . " How could I tell . My nose was in the dirt . " " Which way ? " Andrews laughed . " You go back home , cocky . She ' 11 come back . I 'll fetch her to you . " " Which way ? " " Go wipe yourself . " The white blur of his face reached over Jerry . Jerry knew that the face was grinning . As he stared up at it , his eyes drew in the features , the bright , small eyes and widening nostrils , the short brown beard . His fist closed in the darkness at his side . He struck at the face in the dark rain.  |p365The  tingling in his knuckles was real . He felt the jaw snap back from them and the squelch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He heard Andrews stroke his jaw and his breathing go deep . " I ' ve always wanted to trim you , cocky . I ' ve always aimed to give it to you sometime . " " Which way ? " " This way . " He saw the face come over him again and felt the hands reach out . Stepping back , he struck again , his right against the jaw , his left low down as he stepped in . He felt the man wince , and his elbow was struck up by a rising knee . He glanced aside ; his shoes slewed in the muddy road , skidding him round . Andrews laughed . " A spiteful little cocky , ai n't you ? " The sludge of boots came at him , slowly , carefully . The man limped a trifle from the twist he had had . But Jerry watched for the white blur of the face . He glanced upward under his brows to show his own as little as might be . His head was very clear . He missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell back gasping . Jerry stepped in . He sank two blows as low as he could guess , and as Andrews lunged he threw himself down and stretched his foot out . Andrews fell , and Jerry sprang up and kicked with all his might . His boot found solid flesh . Andrews made no sound . He got up slowly in the dark , but his breath rasped through his heard . He launched himself low down , his head catching Jerry 's thigh and spinning him off . The pain came dully , stiffening his leg . But Andrews was hampered by his weight in the slippery mud . Jerry did not jump on him as he kneeled . He slipped behind him , and as the man rose on his feet he said , " Which way ? " Andrews turned oxlike in his slow surprise to meet the blow with his mouth . Jerry could feel the hair over the lips , the lips themselves , and the teeth under them . He stepped back as Andrews spat . The woods were still . The rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first of all the Swales , had been put upon the market  --  " To be sold , " the notice read in the newsprint , " due to the Misfortunesof a Gentleman . " It was like John Swale to phrase the notice thus , for the only consolation left him was that he came of the Swales of Norwich . When Pierre Levesser called , and entered the paneled room which Richard Swale had built , John Swale did not rise from his chair , and did not bid him sit , because the Levessers were new . He listened , sitting motionless , as young Levesser spoke , watching the color in the young man 's olive face . Though John Swale 's world was narrow as a plank , he could measure a man by what he knew . " Sir , " said young Levesser , " I 'll be round with you as you 've been round with me . I want her because she has made me mad . I want her so I do not eat or sleep . She has that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " Young man , " John Swale answered , " you speak out very strong . " " Sir , " young Levesser replied , " I am only flesh and blood . And look you  --  who else with money would lead her to the church ? And she  --  she loves me too ! " " Young man , " John Swale answered , " it 's lust ! " " And yet , " said young Pierre , " she loves me  --  and that is that . " " Is it so ? " said old John Swale . " D' you think she 'll love the likes of you before a year 's gone by ? " Pierre Levesser drew out his handkerchief and passed it across his lips . " I think , " he said , " we understand each other  --  eh ? " pIOIJohn Swale sat looking at him , curious and cold , and he did not move a finger on the arms of his great chair . Who knows ? Perhaps Pierre Levesser guessed the hardness that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do not understand ? " he said . " Of course , I will be pleased to pay . " " Wait , " said old John Swale . " We 'll be more private , if you would close the door . " What they spoke of no one will ever know , but when they finished , the old man saw him out . Patience Swale was waiting in the garden , and she could not keep her eyes off young Pierre , and she touched him before he reached to kiss her hand . " Lust ! " the old man said . " Lust is never love . " " Father , " said Patience Swale , " what is it you are saying ? " " Richard shall have a ship , " the old man said . " I 'm saying that I sold you  --  and may the Lord have mercy on our souls ! And you , young man  --  I say it in all friendship . You do not know us . Mind you use her well . " There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have forgotten now . He sold her , knowing all the while that Levesser would not forget that money had passed between them . " Dearest , " said Pierre , " is it not a pity ? Your father says he will see very little of us after we are wed . " There is no doubt Hugh Penny loved her . Hugh Penny was the bond servant of Pierre Levesser , indenturedfor ten years , and it was fortunate for Hugh that he knew his place too well to break his silence . HepIO2loved her in the shy way of tongue-tied youth , for whom a smile was enough reward , and he may have loved her without knowing that he loved , for no mention of it crossed his lips , when he told of her to his grandchildren and they themselves never thought of it when they told in turn . It must have been well in the forenoon , for , though it was late September , Hugh Penny remembered the sun was high and warm on his back with the mild heat of autumn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the breeze , and the tern were circling , now gray , now white , as the wind took them . Their cries and the smell of drying cod from the frames by the river were mingling with the odor of phlox in the bed where Hugh was working , exactly as life was mixed with sweetness and with death . The Master loved his flowers . Many a time the Master would touch them gently with the tips of his thin fingers , and the Master could not bear to see them die . When the front door opened , Hugh knew that the Lady was standing there , and the air seemed warmer , once he knew . She would be gazing across the flower beds toward the river . He could fancy her in the carved frame of the front door , with the darkness of the hall behind her . The breeze would be playing at her dress , making her seem light and unsubstantial as a bird above the water ; the wind would be pulling at a strand of her hair , perhaps , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Joker ! " she was calling . " Here Joker , Joker , Joker ! Have you seen Joker , Hugh ? " On his knees among the phlox , Hugh looked up andp103rubbed his hands upon his leather breeches , and then he wiped his face upon his sleeve . " Sure , Madam , " he said . " Joker do be gone with the Master this hour now to the countinghouse . They 're loading the Michelle with rum . " " Ah , yes , " she said . " He loves his master , does n't Joker , Hugh ? " " Yes , Madam , " Hugh said , " it do be wonderful how Joker loves him . He follows right to his back , come rain or shine or day or night  --  watching for him when he walks along the planking , in case the Master might fall off . Ay , there 's a dog . " Her eyes were on him , pale and gray , and he saw that her face was pale that morning . Her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tranquil , and clear as an angel 's face . The Lady had changed since he had known her first , as every one changed when they entered the Master 's house . " Oh , Lady , " he wanted to say . " Oh , Lady , do n't I know ? Oh , Lady , he is sold to Satan and not for the likes of you  --  an angel lady . " The wind was blowing her hair , and blowing at her gray silk dress , and his voice was lost in his throat and in the crimson of his face . She was smiling at him , and in her eyes there was a light , kind and warm , like a candle in a window . " Yes , " she said . " Yes , Joker loves him . " That was all she said . She was not the one to talk , but somehow it seemed to Hugh that she had told him something . It did not seem so long ago that he had stood by that very door with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the wharf , when Mr. Levesser had brought her home . Her cloak had been about her , a light cloak and a hood . She had smiled as she stepped from the chaise and Mr. Levesser had smiled . He had been very elegant in his blue silk coat and his cane and his peruke . " The devil ! " said Mr. Levesser . " But your hand is cold ; you are not afraid ? " " No , " she said , " I am not afraid , Pierre . " His eyes were on her , wide and bright and staring . " So , " he said , " you are here at last . Hey ? Are you sure you do not fear ? " " No , " she said , " I am not afraid , Pierre . " And the Master had laughed in the way he laughed when he was pleased . " The devil ! " he said . " But this is so very fine ! You , Penny , it is you I address . Bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somehow it seemed that she was suddenly a child frightened of the dark . " Pierre , you are not going to  --  drink to-night ? " " Sacre ! " said the Master , and how he laughed and laughed . " Not too much  --  oh , no ! " Then all at once her voice was different , light and careless . " As you wish , " she said . " But before the servants  --  I did not know that you were coarse , Pierre . " It was like the Master , Hugh Penny knew , to wish all he owned afraid . That was all , a moment before the doorway , as the new chaise was being led off to the stable ; but in that moment Hugh Penny knew that she was a lady , as good as any he had seen at home across the seas. pI05Now every one knew Master and his ways  --  our town was too small for secrets then . Every one knew what Pierre Levesser was about down at the Walsings ' house , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he brought Nellie Walsing home with him to dine , that lady did not blench . Hugh heard him tell of it in the parlor , where the lady sat before her needlework , with all the silks and satins on the chairs , and china on the mantle as delicate as lace . " You will meet her , " said the Master , " as you would meet your sister . Yes ? She loves me , do you see ? " The lady laid her sewing down carefully on a little polished table . " Very well , " she said , " but there is one thing , Pierre . " " Ah ! " said Mr. Levesser . " So you choke upon it , eh ? Mind that I bought you . Mind that I paid with money . " A touch of pink was in her cheeks but that was all . There was never a falter in the coolness of her voice . " Please  --  not before the servants , Pierre , " she said . " To the devil with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " I only wish to say I do not care , because  --  Are you listening ? Do you flatter yourself ?  --  I do not love you . That 's been over long ago . " Now there was an odd thing , something you could scarce believe . It hurt the Master that she did not love him ; he was as perverse and strange as that . The blood ran to his face like a reddish-purple wave . And there she sat , hands folded on her lap , watching him and smiling.  | " Oh ? " he said . " But you 'll love me again , before I 'm through . Ah , yes , Madam , on your knees . " And then she laughed , a brittle little laugh like delicate breaking china . " Dear me , " she said , " you must have everything , Pierre . Bring your women to your house . I 've made my bed and I must lie in it . " And Mr. Levesser also laughed and bowed . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course Hugh Penny knew . Every one knew that the Swales were poor ; every one knew why Patience Swale had become his wife , when commerce was envelopinggentility and birth . He had bought her , the Master had , as surely as he ever bought a cargo of sound wine ; and the Master was sharp as a knife at trade and not afraid of risk . The Master had sailed the sea himself ; he knew ports and he knew agents and every danger of the sea . He had bought her , but there was something about her as unattainable as the image of an island upon water glassy calm , when the sails hang slack and the yards creak with the ocean roll . Words . . . Hugh Penny was one who heard them always  --  words , hot and crackling , like the sparks from a log of pine . Words , but the Master never raised his hand to strike . Often , sitting by the fire , hard-handed , stupid , Hugh Penny wondered what would be left for him to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " He heard the Master 's voice . He was listening and he was not ashamed . Out by the kitchen hearth , Joker , the water dog , had pricked up his earspI07at the sound of the voice and wagged his bushy tail so that it brushed the ashes on the bricks . " I tell you that I do not wish it . " " Do n't you ? " he heard the lady say . " But I 'll see him just the same , Pierre . Listen , only listen . I 'll not tell any tales , Pierre . Have I ever said a harsh word of you beyond this house ? I tell you that I 'm going . You know that he is ill . " " Not without me , " the Master said . " Not to that old man . We go like lovebirds , side by side , or not at all . You understand , Madame ? " " Yes , " she said , " but still I 'm going . " " I have explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Michelle is loading . After that we 'll go " " No , " she said , " I 'll go before , Pierre . " Then a chair was pushed back sharply . Hugh Penny heard it slide across the floor . Then he heard the Master 's voice as he had often heard it , shrill and unbridledas an angry child 's . " Damn your icy face ! " the Master shouted . " You 'll do what I say . Do you hear me speak ? " There was a pause and then the lady 's voice answered . " Put down your cane , " she said . " Put it down , Pierre . " ' There was another pause and Hugh Penny was on his feet , trembling outside the door , and then he heard her voice again . " I knew you would n't dare . No , Pierre , I 'll not be beaten . " " My dear , " the Master said , " you will be  --  across the back , just so . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just so . You will be beaten if you leave this house to see him . " " Nonsense , " said the lady ; " you would n't dare , Pierre . " Then the door opened . Mr. Levesser was in the kitchen , gazing at Hugh Penny . " Hey , " said Mr. Levesser , " what are you making here ? " " Polishing your boots , Master , " Penny answered , and a boot was in his hand . " Did you hear anything ? " the Master said . " No , sir , " Penny answered . " The house is that well built . Be you going out , sir ? " " Ay , " the Master said , " to the countinghouse . " " Will you want a light , sir ? " Penny asked . " It do be powerful dark , sir , down upon the wharf . " " No , " said the Master . " Where 's Joker ? Hey , Joker ! He 'll be light enough . I 'll keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want me to fetch you , sir ? " asked Penny , for he knew the Master 's ways . " It 's a narrow walk upon the wharf if you take a bit of liquor . " " Get to bed ! " the Master said . " Joker will see me home . I keep my hand upon his head , like this . Hey , Joker ! Joker knows the way . " The wind was blowing at her dress , making her seem light and airy like a cloud . She was pale but she was a part of the morning , as clear as the morning and the air . " Yes , " she said , " it 's wonderful how Joker loves him . " pI09 Still on his knees beside the bed of phlox , Hugh Penny cleared his throat . " Ay , Ma 'm , " he said ; " there 's no accounting for the ways of dogs or women either . " " Why , Hugh ! " She smiled . It was wonderful to see her smile ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that about her , Hugh Penny always said , that made you forget just who she was . " Your pardon , Ma 'm , " said Hugh . " I do n't know much of women , please ye . But I know dogs . Yes , Ma 'm . I was the underkeeper of kennels across the sea in Surrey . Dogs is odd and strange . They stick by men like women do . " She was listening ; it pleased him she was interested . She had stepped into the garden and was standing above him , so near that the hem of her dress nearly touched him . " Yes , Madam , " said Hugh ; " take Joker , Ma 'm . Now I 've been in this house three years , what with ups and downs . And now , with all respect , the Master is , what you might say , solitary . He do n't go to the tavern but to his countinghouse , do you see ? And there he sits by himself , mind , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every night by the countinghouse door , Ma 'm , just like he was last night , waiting to see the Master home . " " Truly ? " said the lady . " How does he see the Master home ? " Hugh knew that she was making play of him , but he did not care . She had picked a bit of phlox and held it to her face . " How ? " said Hugh . " It 's this way , Ma 'm . ThepII0countinghouse door opens alongside the wharf , right where the tide is running . There 's only a couple of planks between the door and the water . Sure , you know Master , Ma 'm , when he 's had a drop or two . I do n't mean offense . He may not be thinking of the water and there 's Joker . Joker , he keeps him alongside the warehouse . Joker barks and pushes at him . I 've seen it with these eyes . " Then Hugh saw she was not listening ; she was looking at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you this morning , Hugh ? " she asked . " Ay , Ma 'm , " said Hugh . " Why ? " she asked . Hugh Penny grinned . " For not taking the dead flowers out of this here bed . You see , Ma 'm , he hates to see flowers die . " " Yes , " she said , " he loves his flowers . Did he hurt thee , Hugh ? " " No , Ma 'm , " said Hugh , " not me . We bonded folk , we 're used to it . And I 'm as tough as a hickory tree by now , Ma 'm . " " Hugh , " she said , " take this to take the pain away . " He started ; she had dropped a piece of gold on the garden path before him . " Thank you kindly , Ma 'm , " he said . " I 'd take the stick ten times for the like of that . " " And now , " she said , " go fetch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . " Hugh got slowly to his feet and dusted off his leather breeches . " Ma 'm , " he said , " it ai n't my place to say it , but I would n't , were I you . "  | " Why ? " she asked , but she knew why . There was n't much that lady did n't know . Hugh lowered his voice . " Because he 'll beat you , Ma 'm , " he said , " the same as he beat me . I heard him , lady . I heard him last night at candle time . " " Hugh , " she said , " were you listening at the door ? " She was smiling at him , standing so near that he caught the smell of lavender and fine perfume from France . " Sure , lady , " he said . " I 'll not let him beat you . Mind you that , for you 're too fine a lady . " Then he caught his breath , because she had laid her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a hand as he had never felt . " There , you 're a good boy , Hugh , " she said . " Do n't worry ; he 'll not beat me . " Her hand had dropped away from his . " There are some things , " she said , " that are not done . Go in and fetch my cloak . " As they walked through the town , Hugh Penny strode three paces behind her , as a servant should , his eyes upon her back . It was good to see her walking ; she stepped so light and fast , and folks looked at her when she walked by in a way that made him proud to walk behind her . As they passed the tavern door , which the Scarlets kept , he heard some one speak softly . " Poor lady , " some one said . " Heaven pity her , poor lady . " Enoch Porter , the silversmith , came from his shop and bowed . " Good day to you , Madam Levesser , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " pII2 " Yes , " she said , " they are noble tankards , sir . " And Israel Lake , the carriage maker , bowed . " Your new chaise will be ready , Madam , before the week is out , " he said . Hugh Penny knew that they would not have spoken so two years before , but now she was wed to a man of wealth , the glitter of which was on her like the sun . As they left the town and walked along a wooded track , she paused and beckoned him beside her . " There , " she said , " it 's better here . I feel sad walking through the town . " " And sure , what would make you sad , Ma 'm ? " Hugh asked . " There 's none there that wo n't serve you . " " Because I have money , " she said , " and that is all . I see the house we used to own . " " What ? " said Hugh . " The Swale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " The Swales are n't what they used to be . " John Swale , the lady 's father , lived a mile from town on a bit of upland near the marshes , which he had lately bought , and Hugh knew whence the money had come to buy it . The house was at the end of the lane . Its southern windows looked across the marshes and the sea . " Come in , Hugh , " she said . " There 's no need to wait outside . " Her father was seated alone by the coals of an open fire in an old , high-backed , wicker-seated chair . Hugh could tell he was a gentleman , though his clothes were very plain . On his face was a light and ghostly stamp , such as Hugh Penny had seen on dying men.  | " You are better , sir ? " she asked , and bent and kissed him on the cheek . " Yes , " her father said , " better in the morning . " Then Hugh saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Are you happy , dear ? " he asked . " Yes , " she said , " very happy , Father . " The old man nodded and stared at the glowing coals . " You should n't have wed him , " he said . " I was bound to do it , " the lady said . " And I am very happy , Father . " " Yes , " the old man said and sighed ; " there was no money . When I remember  --  " " Hush , " she said . " There 's no reason to remember . " " Easy come , " the old man said , " and easy go . That 's been the way . " " I swear , " she said , " I 'm very happy . Have you heard from Richard ? " " No , " the old man said . " He 's still at sea . Read me from the Bible , daughter . It was kind of Pierre I.evesser to let you come . " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For a long while Hugh Penny sat in a darkened corner , far across the room . Now and then he saw the faces of the old man and the lady and now and then he heard their voices very low . There was something alike in those two faces , Hugh Penny always said : steady , cool and hard . " Daughter , " said the old man , " does he never use thee wrong ? " " No , " she said ; " set thy mind at peace , sir . " " No , " said the old man . " Richard would kill him when he came home . "  | " Pooh ! " she said and laughed . " Richard need never bother . " Hugh remembered the sound of that laugh later . When she called him , the shadows were growing slant , close to the early autumn dusk . The wind was rising , and it was coming on to rain . " Come , Hugh , " she said . " Put on thy hat ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and more than time , Hugh Penny knew . " Lord help her now , " he muttered . " He 'll know she 's been away . " The Master knew it , for the Master was on the doorstepwhen they reached the Master 's house . When he chose , he could hide his temper , so that you could hardly know that there was temper there . He was standing on his doorstep , Hugh remembered , looking out toward his wharf . There was a gale in the sky , rising steadily in the whistling of the southwest breeze . The Master was in his wine-colored satin coat , and his face had a dark look to it which Hugh always knew stood as a sign of trouble . The Master 's voice was soft and throaty , far too soft , Hugh knew . Joker , the water dog , was at the Master 's feet , wagging his tail at the sound of his master 's voice . " Penny , " said the Master , " how splendidly you have cleaned the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there you are , " he said to the lady . " Back from your little stroll , eh ? Come , let me help you with your cloak . And you , Penny , get to the kitchen ; the evening meal is ready . " Yes , the Master could be pleasant when he chose . Hugh could hear them before the dishes were clearedp115away and before the door was shut , speaking of this and that . He could hear the lady laugh and he could hear the Master laughing , but Hugh Penny knew the Master and he knew the Master 's way of waiting . When the other servants were gone , Hugh still sat in the kitchen , looking toward the door . The door opened some time later , Hugh did not know exactly when , and there was the Master smiling , with those large eyes of his wide and staring . " Joker , " he said , " here , Joker . Come in here . And you , Penny , get you gone to bed . " " Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he turned to go , he looked through the door . There were candles on the table and candles in the silver sconces on the wall . By their light he could see the lady sitting in a carvedbackchair , as quiet as a picture . " Good night to you , Hugh , " the lady said . " And many of them ! " said the Master . As the Master closed the door , there was a sharp , metallic sound which told Hugh that the bolt was drawn . And there Hugh stood in the kitchen , listening at the door , because he could not go away . " Pierre , " he heard the lady say , " what are you going to do ? " " Come , Joker , " said the Master . " Where 's my stick ? Ah , there it is . " " What are you going to do , Pierre ? " The lady 's voice was louder . There was a sound and a yelp and a sound and a yelp . 1 iugh 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog , my dear , " the Master said . " It will serve . It 's your turn now . "  | " You do n't dare , " he heard her voice , a little louder , but still level . " Do n't dare ? " the Master said . " Strip off that dress . I 'll not have it spoilt . " " Pierre , " the mistress said . " I 've married you and been a good wife . Take your hand from my shoulder . Do n't forget  --  there 're some things I 'll not stand . " The Master said something which Hugh Penny could not hear . There was a cry from the lady , a clatter of a chair and the crash of glass . " Fool ! " said the Master . " You 're weak as water . Hold still , my lady . Be patient like the dog . " And next minute Hugh Penny heard a sound which he knew well enough . It was the noise of the Master 's cane upon the lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master was a heavy crime in those days , but Hugh Penny forgot the danger . An instant later he found himself beating with his fist upon the panels of the door . He was shouting , " Leave that lady be ! " There was no answer . The lady did not cry out , not a single sound . And Hugh could hear the stick falling , falling , falling . A minute later  --  it could not have been more than a minute , though it seemed much longer  --  the Master stood before him , with his cane still in his hand . " Here ! " said the Master . " What mean you , beating on the door ? " For once Hugh Penny found his tongue . " You brute ! " he shouted . " Ah  --  you dirty brute ! " Then something , it must have been the Master'spI17cane , struck him on the head and Hugh Penny was sprawling on the kitchen floor . " That for you ! " the Master said . " Good night , ma belle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countinghouse , in case you 're feeling lonely . " When the Master opened the kitchen door , a gust of wind came in , which made the candles gutter ; the rain was coming with the wind and the night was black at pitch , but the Master did not heed it . As Hugh Penny struggled to his knees , he saw the Master stride into the black , with a look  --  Hugh Penny always said  --  as though he had got the better at last of something . Even Hugh Penny could see that the blows were somehow a victory , the fire from smolderingwords and looks , as sure as flame came up from a smoking tinder box . I high Penny could hear him laughing . " That for all the Swales , " the Master said , and then the door went slam and the kitchen was very still . At the same moment with the closing of the door , there was scurrying of feet ; Joker ran across the kitchen , whining , for he had seen the Master go . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Swales who had ordered freedmen whipped when the colony was new . Fifty years ago no man could have dreamed of such an act . Yet a Swale had been beaten by a commoner , while the wind was whistling by the house in the beginning of a southwest gale . It was a time for winds , for all the world was changing. 1 le got dizzily to his feet , hardly hearing Joker'spII8whining then , though it always seemed to him afterwardsthat the whining of that dog and the whistling of the wind were in back of everything . He walked softly toward the parlor , where the door was still ajar . " Madam ! " he called . " Madam ! " But there was no answer . He thought that she would cry or sob , as any woman should , not knowing what the Swales were made of then . In the parlor , one of those carved chairs had fallen over , a wineglass and a crystal decanter had fallen to the floor , with the wine run from it like blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him ; she was seated in another chair , leaning her head upon a table , pillowed in her arms , her slender fingers tightly clenched . Her dress was torn , leaving her back half bare , with red welts upon the soft white skin . " Madam , " said Hugh . " Ah , Lady , God help us all . " Then she looked up , that thin face as motionless as stone . Her eyes were wide but there were no tears in them . Hugh could see the marks where the little teeth had dug into the lower lip . Forgetting , seemingly , that her dress was torn , she looked up as though nothing at all had happened . " Why , Hugh , " she said , and he had never heard her voice so soft . " There 's blood upon thy face , Hugh . Did he beat thee too ? " " Madam , " said Hugh , " it 's nothing , Madam . I 'm as tough as a hickory tree , I am . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would have killed him for what he done to you . " " Good boy , " said the lady . " Good boy . But wep119must n't mind the Master . The Master 's very wild . " Then something was clawing against his leg ; it was Joker , wagging his tail and whining . The lady looked at him and sat up straight . " What does Joker want , Hugh ? " the lady said . As he answered , the wind went whistling through the eaves , and in spite of the closed windows , he could hear the roaring of the sea . " Sure , he wants to go to the countinghouse with the Master , Ma 'm . That 's where the Master 's gone . " " Yes , " said the lady , " that 's where the Master 's gone . Where are Pomp and the maids , Hugh ? " " Sure , Ma 'm , they 're sleeping in the ell . Rest you easy , Ma 'm , they did not hear a sound . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Joker , " said the lady , " come here , Joker . " But Joker did not come ; he kept running here and there about the room , sniffing , whining , looking at the lady , looking back at Hugh , raising himself on his hind legs toward the window where the rain was slapping . " Yes , Ma 'm , " said Hugh . And he wanted to talk of something else , so that he could forget the lady 's back . " Yes , Ma 'm , he do be wanting to get to the Master . I le knows it 's an ill night for the Master to be walking on the wharf . I 'll be letting him out , so that he can watch the Master , Ma 'm . Then I 'll get you a glass of spirits , if you please . " " No , " said the lady , " it 's too bad a night for Joker , I lugh . Tie him by the fire . " " But , Ma 'm  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tie him by the fire , " she said . " And sit up till thepI20Master comes . And give me a candle , Hugh . I am going to sleep . " " Yes , Ma 'm , " said Hugh . " I 'll tie him up . " The wind was coming to a fearful gale , so that it was like voices outside , all sorts of voices . It made him shiver sometimes , sitting by the kitchen fire , because with all the wind Joker kept on whining . Even when Hugh slapped him , he kept on whining . Sometimes , what with the rain and the wind , he could think he heard the Master 's steps coming toward the door , dancing and unsteady , but the Master never came . It must have been along toward morning , because outside , through the windows , it looked a little gray , when all at once he had a fright . He had not heard a sound except the wind , when all at once Joker gave a bark and Hugh Penny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in white , and beautiful , oh , beautiful . Her hair was down her back , brown hair which was almost gold . " Hugh , " she said , " bring me a cloak . I 'm cold . The wind keeps me awake , Hugh . Has the Master not come yet ? " " No , Ma 'm , he ai n't come yet . " " I wonder what can be keeping him , " the lady said . " Has he ever been so late ? " " No , Ma 'm , he ai n't , " said Hugh . Then the lady looked toward the gray in the windows and drew a deep breath . Then she looked at Joker and then at Hugh and drew another breath . " Hugh , " she said , " I 'll have some spirits now , a very little in a glass . I feel so very cold . " Hugh Penny was the one to open the front door when they brought the Master home . They broughtpI2Ihim on a shutter from the mud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , when they went to dig for shellfish at ebb tide . The Master 's clothes were thick with mud and bits of weed and stone , which made the Master seem more like a being from the sea than a man who had walked on land . The Master 's lips were twisted back and his eyes were open wide and staring up at Hugh , for all that he was dead . " Penny , " he seemed to say , " did you not let out the dog ? " They brought him to the great chamber and laid him on the bed , taking care first to move the coverlet away . The lady watched them , leaning against the wall with her arms crossed on her breast . " Hugh , " she said , " go with the men and give them spirits in the kitchen . " As the bearers of the Master tiptoed down the stairs , I lugh found himself turning back . The lady was standing by the chamber window , staring out toward the town , where the houses stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weathercocks upon them , shining golden . What she was staring at , Hugh Penny could not tell . " Will that be all , Madam ? " he said . " Yes , " she said , " that 's all . " " Will you watch with him alone , Ma 'm ? " Penny asked . " Yes , " she said , " I 'll be with him alone . " And then she paused , looking at the Master . " Wait , " she said . " Yes , Madam ? " said Hugh . " Bring up Joker , " said the lady . " Joker always loved him . "  |p125DANIEL  SWALE HAS LEFT A RECORD of when ships once crossed our bar at night , in defiance of the Crown . It was an old man'srecollections  --  one must remember that . Yet something of Daniel Swale is still left in the Swale house . On entering the room where Daniel Swale drank his wine , after he had left the sea , you could not help but feel a presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there till very recently , was the only one who was oblivious . Each evening after dinner , he would light his cheap cigar and stare placidly at the picture of Daniel Swale above the mantelpiece . It was a portrait of a lean man in a sea cloak , with wide , dark eyes . " Now there 's an old sea dog for you , " Dennis Swale would say , " and , just between you and me , he bought blacks off the Guinea coast . There 's the type to put fear in a forecastle . Why , when he was a child , he pulled a lion 's tail . " pI26He never saw that Daniel Swale was a man with a vision , who followed visions always . He never thought of Daniel Swale as sitting by his block-front desk in that very room , listening for old sounds that even then were dim . It was the time of the enforcing of the old " molasses act " , just before the Revolutionary War , which Daniel Swale described in his recollections , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swale 's library . " The door to Mr. Whistle 's private room was open "  --  the words were written in Daniel Swale 's flowing hand  --  " and I was not a fool , and I heard Mr. Whistle speak as follows , viz : " ' I 'll ship in French molasses duty free , as sure as I 'll have my rum watered on the Guinea coast , and it 's nobody 's affair , if you should ask me that . What 's trading for ? The ships must sail . ' " I asked Mr. Whistle , " wrote Daniel Swale , " to ship me as a boy . I came there with John Scarlet . It was before the Lion come to town . " Even as he wrote it , the lion was in his mind , minglingvaguely with the ships , and one can understand it , for the mainsprings had not rusted yet . There are boys in Haven 's End right now , who think the same thoughts , and you can hear their voices calling in the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling through the distance of our town , not the distance of its space but of its time ,  --  calling with an unchanging timbre . Mr. Whistle 's countingroom was empty . Outside , Mr. Whistle 's schooner Sally was lying by the wharf , high up in the water , for her cargo was all out ; andpI27the wind was blowing easterly . There would be rain by night . Hogsheads of molasses covered the wharf , and the air was full of flies . And over everything was a thick , sweet odor , heavy but not unpleasant , of molasses and of rum from the distillery . They were speaking in the private room , and Daniel knew the voices . One was Mr. Pringle 's , the Collector of the Port , and the other was the Reverend Ezra Dole 's , who was minister of the old First Church . " But I tell you , " the Collector was saying , " the Commissioner is coming . " " Let him come , " said Mr. Whistle . " He has n't seized a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the Reverend Dole . " Thomas Whistle , will you not consider me ? " " You 've put your pennies in , " said Mr. Whistle , " hut you do n't steer the ship . " All things seemed possible to Daniel , for he was very young , but even then he wondered what business a minister had on Mr. Whistle 's ' wharf . " Thomas Whistle  --  " said the Reverend Mr. Dole . " My dear sir , " said Mr. Whistle , " you should have thought before . Your name is down with mine as owner . " And the door opened , and out came Mr. Dole , with Mr. Pringle close upon his heels . As they passed through the ' countingroom , immersed in their own thoughts , their faces looked the same , though the Reverend Mr. Dole was large and heavy , all in black , and Mr. Pringle was thin and small , in a blue coat and nankeen breeches . It seemed as though a hand which had held their faces smooth and suave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sagging . The wrinkles about his eyes were deep and loose , and his mouth was hanging relaxed , like a man 's mouth in his sleep . Daniel Swale was the one who knocked at Mr. Whistle 's door , because Johnny Scarlet did not dare to knock , but once they were in Mr. Whistle 's room , they both stood silent , not knowing where to start . Mr. Whistle was the great man of our town , rich from the Indies and from the African Trade . Mr. Whistle was seated before a table . His coat and wig were off , hangingeach upon a peg . His face was very thin , like all the Whistles ' faces . His nose was sharp and pointed , and his lips were set in a downward curve . " Now what brings you in here , boys ? " Mr. Whistle said . Daniel shuffled his feet and twisted his hat between his hands . " Please , sir , " said Daniel , " do you wish to ship two cabin boys ? " " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " began Daniel , pointing , " is Johnny Scarlet  --  " " Yes , " said Mr. Whistle , " I know a Scarlet when I see one ,  --  and you 're a Swale , I 'll wager . Who 's your father , boy ? " And Daniel told him that it was Richard Swale , andhe remembered that Mr. Whistle pursed his lips . " Does your father know you 're here ? " he asked . " No , sir , " answered Daniel . " Well , " said Mr. Whistle , " he would n't like it , if he knew . Do you mean to run away ? "  | " I will , sir , if you 'll take me , " Daniel answered . " You , Scarlet , go see Captain Marigold and tell him that I sent you , " Mr. Whistle said . " And me , sir ? " asked Daniel Swale . Before he answered , Mr. Whistle crossed one knee above the other . " There 's kindliness in me , " said Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You have not got the strength . We do n't ship weak boys on a voyage  --  " In his humiliation it seemed to Daniel that his words were lodged fast in his throat . " Another boy 's thought broken , eh ? " Mr. Whistle said . " I know . Smash ' em ! Smash the lot of ' em as quickly as you can . Listen  --  there 's no justice in this world but strength . Come back when you can pull a rope . " " Will you take me , sir ? " asked Daniel Swale . " Will you take me , if I 'm strong ? " " Yes , " said Mr. Whistle . He never thought that he was changing the life of Daniel Swale or sending him on a quest among the shadows . There was a witch in Haven 's End then . Her name was Madam Haight , and Daniel knew her . All the childrenand slaves and bond servants knew Madam 1 bight . He had seen her often enough walking across the square , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a country woman 's bonnet and a billowing gown of rich green satin , patched with red . She had come by ship from Quebec , they said , after the latep130war , the wife of a British officer who had died on the Plains of Abraham ; but others said she was no wife . It was raining , Daniel remembered , when he reached Madam Haight 's house . It stood on the edge of the cedar swamp , where deer still wintered , a dwelling of a single room . " Come in , Dan Swale , " she said . He stood close to the threshold , shivering from the rain and wondering how she knew his name . Her hair was jet-black , streaked with gray , and her face was rough with whiskers like a man 's . The wind was blowing through cracks where the clapboarding had fallen . A row of dresses hung on pegs along the wall , all silk , but torn and soiled . " Come in , " she said . Now that he was on the threshold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Madam , " he began . But he could not finish . He could see the rafters heavy with bunches of dried twigs , and with roots like old hands , and in the darkness he saw a kettle upon the embers of the hearth . " Herbs , " she said , " herbs and roots , those be . The selectmen can not move me on , while the roots are growing . Yonder 's bay leaves and sweet fern , and the daisy root for deafness . The gentlemen and ladies come here and the doctors too . Sure , I know gentlemen and ladies , and I know the stars  --  " " Madam , " said Daniel Swale , " may I ask a question , if you please ? " " Sure , " she said . " I know questions and the answers to the Alpha and Omega . "  |p131Daniel  cleared his throat , but he could not ask the question which he wished . " Madam , " said Daniel Swale , " is it true you know the dark spirits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes were like dark water . " There are light ones and dark ones . I 've seen ' em both , " she said , " since I was pretty . " The rain was louder on the roof when she had finished speaking . Pomp , the black slave at home , had his spirits too . Daniel had heard him calling on them by rattling bones at night . The Reverend Mr. Dole himself confessed to spirits . Daniel had heard him when the church was still . " Oh , Lord , " Mr. Dole would pray , " save us from the tyrannies of unjust laws and save us from the Dark Spirits of the air . " " Sure , " the witch was saying , " you 'll not hear the spirits till you get old . What do you want , Dan Swale ? " " Madam , " said Daniel Swale . But he could not say it , for she was only like a poor old woman . " Speak out , " she said  --  " speak out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or health , and you 're too young for love . " " If you please , Madam , " he said , " I want strength , if you please , to go to sea . " And then she began to laugh . " Sure , " she said , " you wo n't need no strength .  --  The rain is over . Get on home . " I le never told where he had been . He would notp132have dared to tell , when his last hope was gone that night . " Wait , " the witch called to him , just as he turned to go , and he could see her in the shadows , laughing . " Wait , " she said , " I 'll tell ye . When next you see a lion , pluck two living hairs out of his tail , and those will make ye strong . " " But , Madam , " Daniel answered , for he could still be literal , " there are no lions here . " " No , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either , hereabouts . " Only the next morning , when he was standing in the square with Johnny Scarlet , he knew she was a real witch . There was no reason that they should have been there , unless it was pure destiny . It was high noon , and warm for early summer , and the river was flat calm , so that all the wharves and ships were double . Two ships were in from the Indies , with specie in their cabins , and you could hear the sailors singing , as they warped them up to Scarlet 's wharf . " Chi'lly , " you could hear their voices shouting , " Chi'lly . . . Chi'lly ! " Then a hand bell was ringing , jingle , jingle . It was the town crier , coming down the street past the shops with their swinging signs , and as he walked , he tolled his bell and shouted in a sing-song voice . " Hear ye ! Hear ye ! " he was shouting . " For those who be curious at the wonders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New George Inn , a lion new come from Barbary . A lion brought in from Africa . His cage is on a wain drawn by two yoke of oxen  --  a monstrous lion  --  " Daniel Swale never forgot the crier 's voice , echoing in the still , warm air . " A lion . A wondrous beast , the size of a calf and twenty times the weight . There be hair on his withers , and a shaggy mane , and the eyes and nose of a cat . I le is worth the examination of all the curious  --  for a shilling a head . A lion at the George Inn yard  --  a shilling for a sight you may never see again ! " It seemed to Daniel Swale that the square was suddcnlysilent and that he was standing all alone . Then the buildings and the square seemed very close , and the ships ' masts in the river were like towers . " John Scarlet , " he said , " have you a shilling ? " " Yes , " said Johnny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scarlet , " said Daniel Swale , " will you play me at chuck farthing ? I want to make a shilling . " " Why do you need a shilling ? " Johnny Scarlet asked . " To see the lion , " Daniel answered . " I need to see that lion . " There had been a trained pig before and two trained dogs , and once a dancing bear , but there had never been a lion . John Scarlet made a hole with his heel and marked a line four paces off . " Chuck , " he said . " What are you shivering at ? " " I 'm not shivering , " said Daniel Swale . He forgot that he was playing chuck farthing in the public square , pI34and all he saw was the brown ground and broad copper pieces in the dust , until a hand seized his collar and jerked him backward off his feet . And then he turned to see the Reverend Mr. Dole . There was no gentleness with children then , and Mr. Dole was earnest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it too ? " he said . " Pick up that filthy money . " As Daniel stooped to pick it up , Mr. Dole dropped his collar and seized him by the ear . " Eightpence , eightpence , " Mr. Dole was saying . " You 'll thank me when you 're older . The money must go to the poor , Daniel . It is not fit to keep . " Mr. Dole 's fingers were very strong . He had twisted the ears of other boys . The pain made Daniel wish to cry aloud . The tears were starting from his eyes , but even in his pain he thought of Mr. Whistle 's countinghouse . " Wait , " he said , " I wished to see the lion . " " Daniel , " said Mr. Dole . " Take that ! " Daniel took it , for there was nothing else to do . It was a blow and nothing more , and it was a time when blows were freely given , but that blow was different , though Daniel could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of grave humiliation , becauseDaniel knew that Mr. Dole would not have struck if he had been a strong boy . The air seemed filled with flashing lights . There was a taste of brimstone in his mouth , and all respect and decency were lost to him in a wave of hate . His foot lashed out before he thought , and he had committed sin . " You imp ! " shouted Mr. Dole.  | " Then give me back my eightpence ! " Daniel shouted back . There seemed to be a swarm of bees buzzing in his head , but he heard another voice . " Leave him , " some one was saying . " Leave him for the moment , Mr. Dole . " As Daniel looked up , he saw that two gentlemen were standing very near him . One was Mr. Whistle , very thin and tall , and beside him was a heavy , red -- faced gentleman , whom Daniel had never seen , dressed in a riding cloak and boots . " Yes , " he said , " leave down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " This is Mr. Dickey , " Mr. Whistle said , " who has come to see how our collector runs the port . " Mr. Dole 's face twitched and Daniel saw him dig his fingers against his palms . Mr. Dole did not answer , and Mr. Whistle cast a quick , hard glance at Mr. Dole . " Well , " said Mr. Dickey , " every one 's gone mad in this cursed country . It 's not so odd to find a minister breaking law . " " Sir , " said Mr. Dole ,  --  and Daniel saw that his cc was long and white . " Fifty years ago , you 'd be n the pillory for half that speech . " Mr. Whistle waved his hand , still looking hard at Mr. Dole . " I lush , Ezra , " he said . " Mr. Dickey , in this wild place where all of us have our wrongs , we have to live . I trust you 'll report them , Mr. Dickey , when you sail for home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish to heaven you were with me there and I 'd have you safe in Newgate. "  |p136Mr  . Whistle raised his eyebrows . " Sir , " he said , " you use harsh words . You say we have made a false declaration , but your collector , who carries His Majesty 's commission , has passed our cargo . " " And I tell you , " Mr. Dickey raised his voice , " the collector is a piece of all the rest of you . I tell you  --  do n't stop me while I speak  --  your schooner came in deep-laden from the Indies . You made declaration on five hogsheads of molasses . Do you take me for a fool ? There were twenty hogsheads in that hold , if there was one . Now where 's the rest ? " " Can you find it ? " Mr. Whistle asked . Mr. Dickey drew in his breath and turned to Mr. Dole . " Sir , " he said in a different tone , " this is no dealing for a minister . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you out . " " Mr. Dole gave me a small sum for a venture . I told you he knows nothing about molasses , " said Mr. Whistlevery quickly . " Thomas , " Mr. Dole said , " Thomas  --  " " Ezra , leave this to me , " said Mr. Whistle . " Mr. Dickey , your government does wrong to interfere with trade . We 've made this land , and there 'll be bloody revolution . " Mr. Dickey smiled and blinked . " D ' you think I 'm to be threatened by a lot of smugglers ? " he said . Mr. Whistle smiled also . " Whistle , " Mr. Dickey said at length , " will youp137open your warehouse doors , or will you have me smash them down ? " Mr. Whistle took another pinch of snuff . " May I ask , " he inquired , " just how you 're going to smash them ? " " Did you ever hear of a writ ? " asked Mr. Dickey . " I 've got one in my pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbed his chin , and he and Mr. Dickey stared at each other for another moment . " Thomas , " said Mr. Dole , " Thomas  --  " " Ah , " said Mr. Whistle , " one of those writs of assistance ? Who 'll help you , Mr. Dickey ? I can only think of one man with the courage in this whole town . " " So you 'll resist the law , will you ? " Mr. Dickey raised his voice again , until it rang across the square . " I 've a dozen troopers following . They 'll be here in town by night . " " My dear sir , " said Mr. Whistle , " there 's no use being round . I 've told you there were only five hogsheads in the hold . The rest were water casks for ballast . Is n't that enough ? " " And I say , " Mr. Dickey answered , " we 'll look at those water casks to-night , as soon as my men ride in . " There was always talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , and every boy there knew that rum and sugar and molasses made Haven 's End . The lines on Mr. Dole 's face were deeper , and he seemed almost ill , and then Daniel saw that Mr. Dole was looking at him strangely.  | " Get you home , boy , " said Mr. Dole . " I 'll report it to your father before the evening meal . " Then the bell of the town crier was ringing , and Daniel heard his voice above the other noise . " Hear ye ! Hear ye ! A Lion in the George Inn yard . . . " Mr. Whistle sighed , looking about the square . From a distance men were staring at them , standing in small groups and whispering . Daniel Swale thought nothing of it then . He only knew much later that he had witnessedan event of a turbulent time , that was destined to lead to the war of the Revolution . He was thinking of the lion , and he wanted to be strong . It was Pomp who told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black slave , and the story was that he had been a king , but Pomp was carrying a load of wood , like any other man , toward the kitchen door . " Master Dan , " he said , " the prayer man  --  he been here . " " Did he see my father ? " Daniel asked , " Is my father angry ? " Pomp showed his white teeth . They had been filed to points before he left the Guinea Coast , and there was a great hole in his flat nose from which had hung a ring . " Pomp , " said Daniel , " there 's a lion at the Inn . Tell me , Pomp , is it true that hairs from a lion 's tail will make you strong ? " Pomp showed his teeth again and scratched the matted hair upon his head . " Mebbe so , " he said , " black man no can tell . Whenp139I was boy like you  --  me , I had the lion claw from witch fella . Me  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front entry , he heard his father calling him from the parlor . It was a small room , which was simple and unpainted . The furniture was mostly oak , such as richer families had discarded for mahogany . Upon the wall by the chimney hung a steel cap and breastpiece , which his **26;1882;TOOLONG worn when he led a regiment in King Philip 's War . His father was standing by the window , in threadbare , snuff-colored clothes , and his Aunt I.evesser was there also , sitting in an old oak armchair . She had come to live with them after Daniel 's mother died . " Daniel , " said his father , " is it true you kicked our minister ? " Before he answered , he saw his aunt was looking at him with a half-smile on her lips , which seemed to tell one everything , yet nothing . " If you please , sir , " said Daniel , " he took my eightpenceand wrung me by the ear . " " Take off your coat , " his father said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was like his father , that even , melancholy justice , which stood above adversity and joy . Daniel always remembered him as he rose and took the rod , testing it in his heavy hands , without a change of feature . " Daniel , " he said , " Mr. Dole is an honest man . Come here and take your stripes . " Richard Swale laid the birch smartly a dozen times across Daniel 's shoulders , while Daniel held his breath . Though he felt the gross injustice , he could feel nop140resentment against his father for it , but instead a growing anger against the Reverend Mr. Dole . " Richard , " his aunt said , " you always strike too hard . " " There , " said his father . " Daniel , why were you so late in coming home ? " " If you please , sir , " said Daniel , " there 's a lion at the Inn . Please , sir , may I have a shilling to see the lion ? " His father walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clasped behind his back . Richard Swale always pondered over small things as though they were important . " And why do you wish to see a lion ? " " Fiddlesticks ! " said his aunt , " I 'll give the boy a shilling . " Richard Swale turned from the window and walked across the room and back . " Dan , " he said , " you 'll have no shilling , and you , Madam , you shall give none to him . You shall go to the minister instead , Daniel , and make him your apology . That will cost you nothing , and he shall be your lion . " Only long afterwards Daniel knew there was a similaritybetween his father and himself , the same harsh humor , the same unbending will . And that was when their wills clashed for the first time and the last . Daniel heard his own voice , thin and high , and it did not sound like his own . " I 'll not go , sir , " he said . " You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did him . " There was a long , dull silence . He could clearlyp141hear the thudding of the wood , which Pomp was piling by the kitchen door . The look on his father 's face was very strange , and his aunt was first to speak . " Why , " she said , " there 's still life in the Swales . " His father had laid his hand on a chair back . " Madam , " he said , " do you taunt me , because Iobey the law ? " Madam Levesser had risen . There was something in that room which Daniel could not see , but he could feel it in the silence . " Richard , " she said , " even the boy sees clearer . Will you send him to make apologies to an  --  informer , Richard Swale ? " " Daniel , " said his father , " leave the room . " And Daniel left , and he was glad to go , but even in the passage he heard his father speaking . " Madam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest man . If any one is an informer , it is I. Mr. Dole came here to ask me my advice . What was there for an honest man to give ? I told him to lodge information with authority . I told him to tell what he knows and be free of it  --  that the molasses will be moved to Mr. Whistle 's barn to-night . " That was how Daniel knew , and he knew that his father was an honest man . All at once he could see it very clearly . He could see why Mr. Whistle had taken his snuff and had smiled in the square that noon . There would be no molasses when they smashed his warehouse door , because he would move it after dark . He knew that Mr. Dole would tell , and that telling would be right , and yet his heart was beating faster.  |p142Then  he was standing in the dooryard , and the wind was blowing toward the trees , softly as it sometimes did toward evening , and , from where he stood , he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the ships , like a strange , small forest along the river bank . The new clock in the First Church was striking out the hour of seven when he turned and saw his father standing near him . " Daniel , " said his father , " Daniel  --  " Then he stopped as though he could not go on , and Daniel remembered how tall his father seemed and how the wind blew at his wig . " Daniel , " said his father , " will you go to Mr. Dole ? " " No , sir , " he said , " I will not . " His father stood looking toward the river , not a muscle moving on his face . " Daniel , " he said , " if you do not go , you will not be welcome in my house . " And Daniel knew his father spoke the truth , as surely as he knew that he could not go . The wind was blowing from the sea , as salt and bitter as the tears that filled his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " He knew his father loved him in a way , and his father laid a hand gently on his shoulder . " There , " he said , " that is better . " He did not know why Daniel wept . He did not know , because the Swales were endowed with a peculiar stubbornblindness . " That is better , Daniel , " said Richard Swale . " Let me know when you come back . "  |p143As  he turned and walked away , Daniel watched his father 's shadow on the grass . It was dark and very long and ugly . He was turning from the dooryard , when a thing happened which he was never to forget . " Daniel , " he heard some one calling , " stop a moment , Daniel . " It was his aunt who was calling . She was coming down the path , past a cluster of sumac bushes . " Daniel , " she whispered , and pressed something in his hand , " here 's thy shilling , Daniel . " Then suddenly her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet like running water , and that her arms were about him , and that she pressed him to her close ; and then he found himself sobbing , his head buried in her gray silk dress . " Poor Daniel , " she was saying . " We love bright things . " The George Inn stood on the main street , then some distance away from the shipping . It had the same simplicityof line as the older tavern by the water , but it was larger , with fine , panelled chambers and a high , carved doorway . Instead of one great room with a sanded floor , there was a ballroom where a fiddler sometimes played , and a parlor and a taproom which opened to the yard , where the Boston stage changed horses . On the street outside Daniel was surprised to see so many people , most of them mechanics and sailors . " Curse the Customs , " he heard some one saying . " Ay , " said a voice that Daniel knew . " Speak upp144and stand for your rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Captain Marigold who was speaking . CaptainMarigold was one of Mr. Whistle 's masters , a small , broad man in canvas breeches . His hair , already white , was done up in a clubbed eelskin , and the whiteness of his hair seemed to bring out all the sly wrinkles that surrounded the Captain 's eyes and mouth . " Sure , " said Captain Marigold . " Now there 's the bully boys . There 'll be rum enough when you finish up tonight . " Their voices were low ; they kept staring at the inn door as they spoke , but farther on at the Anchor Tavern , Daniel could hear other voices that were louder . Some one was shouting down the street : " Free trade and rum ! " Captain Marigold cocked his head to one side , andthe wrinkles deepened about the corners of his mouth . " Look lively , boys , " he called . " Here comes Mr.Whistle ! Give him a helping hand . " Sure enough , Mr. Whistle was walking down the street , bland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his right arm . " Marigold , " he said , " does everything go well ? " " Sure sir , " said Captain Marigold , " fine as silk . The boys are ready . " " Right , " said Mr. Whistle . " Then get moving . " And Daniel knew as sure as he was standing by the inn that they would move Mr. Whistle 's molasses from the warehouse as soon as it was dark , over to his barn . He was sure with some intuition of his own that Mr. Whistle did not know that Mr. Dole had told . Hisp145heart was beating wildly as he walked through the tavern door and turned into the taproom . It seemed to Daniel that he had never been so small and weak . Should he tell Mr. Whistle when his father had not told ? The taproom was already lighted by candles on every table . Two boys in white aprons were carrying bowls and pewter cups to all the gentlemen . William Scarlet , the owner of the inn , was in his apron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were seated , smoking long clay pipes , talking in low voices and staring across the room . Mr. Parlin was there and one of the Levessers , and Mr. Busk . " Look , " said Mr. Parlin . " Here comes one of Swale 's brats now . " " Ah ! " said Mr. Levesser . " Here 's a toast for him . Telltales  --  Tar ' em and roll ' em in a feather bed ! " Goodman Scarlet glanced across the room . " I beg you be more easy , " he said . " There 's trouble here enough . " Daniel followed his glance and saw that he was looking at a gentleman seated all alone , who was drinking placidly at a glass of flip . It was Mr. Dickey , whom Daniel had seen in the square . Mr. Dickey was still in his riding cloak and boots , and his look made Daniel sure that Mr. Dickey had been told . Mr. Dickey was only waiting until his troopers came . " Now , " said Goodman Scarlet , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you please , " said Daniel , " I 've come to see the lion . " Goodman Scarlet took his shilling.  | " Then get out and see him , " he said . Outside in the inn yard it was growing dusk , but four pine knots were lighted , so that any one could see . Some men stood about a great cage upon a heavy wain . The wheels of the wain were painted red and yellow . There was a cage upon the wain , like the Sabbath-breaker 's cage upon the square , and in the cage Daniel saw the lion . Now that he saw , he felt a disappointment , which was often to come upon him , when he saw the other wonders of the earth . The beast was nearer the size of a dog than a calf , and his coat was mangy . He was pacing back and forth inside his cage and staring out with sleepy eyes . " I warn you , " his owner was saying , a mangylookingman like the lion ; " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then some one began to laugh , but Daniel hardly heard , as he edged nearer . He knew that all his life was in the balance . For a moment he hesitated , close to the cage , where there was a sharp , unpleasant odor , like the smell of a thousand cats , and then he seemed to be as cold as ice . His eyes were on the beast 's tail that was moving softly , like a great rope cable frayed upon the end . He was as cold as death , but it seemed to him that something inside him made him move without his own volition , and he could never tell exactly what occurred . He heard the keeper shout , and then he heard a snarl that was like a clap of thunder . He had snatched for the lion 's tail between the bars , and next he was staggering backward . Some one had pulled him back.  |p147There  was a gash upon his arm . All at once his sleeve was red and moist , but he could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held a tuft of hair . The next he knew he was in the taproom , where they must have carried him , seated on a bench , leaning against the wall . It was as if a curtain were drawn from before his eyes . A roar of voices was about him , first blurred , then clearer , and Mr. Whistle 's face , and Goodman Scarlet 's and Mr. Levesser 's and Mr. Dickey 's were all staring at him . Some one was binding a cloth around his arm , and the lion 's owner was speaking . " I tell you , " he was saying , " he stepped straight up and tweaked his tail . " " Now ! " said Goodman Scarlet . " It 's what I tell you , gentlemen ; there 's a devil in them Swales . " " Give him a dram ! " said Mr. Dickey . " Why would he want to be pulling at a lion ? " " Ah , Mr. Dickey , " Mr. Whistle said , in that pleasantvoice of his , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're through with this . " " It 's what I tell you , gentlemen , " Scarlet repeated . " ' There 's a devil in them Swales . " " Here , " said Mr. Dickey . " What 's the noise outyonder ? Do I hear a wagon rolling in the street ? " " Mr. Dickey , " said Mr. Whistle , " I 'd advise younot to look for any wagon . It 's a hard walk to the door . " " Very well , " said Mr. Dickey ; " but may I add mytroopers will be coming ? " But Daniel Swale hardly listened . He was looking at his hand . It was still tight clenched , for all thep148blood upon it , and the lion 's hairs were in it , dripping with the blood . " Daniel , " said Scarlet , for he was a kindly man , " are you feeling better now ? " " Yes , thank you . " Daniel got to his feet . The floor seemed to move beneath him , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as though a burden had been lifted from him . He knew that the witch was right . The lion had made him strong . He remembered , not so long before , that he had sailed a small boat to the river mouth . He remembered how still she had been , dull and loggish , tied against the wharf , but she had been like a living thing , once he had pushed her free ; and now he had the same freedom . The lion had made him strong . His arms were the same ; his cheeks were thin , but he had dared to pull a lion 's tail . " Mr. Whistle , " he said , " may I see you in the private room ? " Then they were alone in a small white room . There was a table in the center , Daniel remembered , covered with cards . Though cards were forbidden by the law , every one knew that gentlemen played them every night . " Well , " said Mr. Whistle , " what is it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His head was light , but his thoughts were very clear . " Mr. Dole has told , sir , " Daniel said . " They know you are moving the molasses to your barn . They 'll seize it there to-night . " Mr. Whistle was looking at him , and as he looked , he reached to the table , took up a card and tore itpI49sharp in two . Daniel Swale looked back at Mr. Whistle . I le knew what he had done . He could never return to his father 's house . " Thanks , " said Mr. Whistle . He did not seem surprised . " I 'll move the molasses on . " " Please , sir , " said Daniel , " I 've been thinking you might do this : You can take the lion 's wain . It is in the yard here . It 's painted red and yellow . Draw out the wain , sir , and the lion 's cage . Leave the lion in your barn , and put the hogsheads on . They 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " May I ask , " said Mr. Whistle , " how you thought of that ? " " Please , sir , " said Daniel , " it came to me  --  when I pulled the lion 's tail . "  |p153HAVEN  'S END WAS LIKE A PIRATE'Srendezvous in 1778 . The list of its privateers , though incomplete , covers a dozen pages in the county records of the Revolutionary War . You can find the Charming Nancy with the rest . She was known chiefly because her crew , when prisoners , rose up and seized the Enterprise , of British privateering registry . She was named , one supposes , for some girl in Haven 's End , and was built in one of the river yards . A sloop , she was called , though the term is vague in that day of pinks and snows and other archaic rigs , and the classification of the merchant shipping is nearly impossible to follow ; but she was called a sloop , burden : eighty tons ; master : Daniel Swale ; owner : Messrs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Swales grew rich , when the Charming Nancy sailed . The Charming Nancy brought in the first money to Daniel Swale for the building of the brick Swale house on the ridge , and the Swalesp154are guarding what is left of that fortune still . That was when cannon lay before the warehouses , when every wharf had its prize ships , and when goods were up at auction almost daily . Any morning you could have heard the fife and drum calling for new crews . Whistle and Company made a million , before they took their losses ; and the Scarlets cleared four hundredthousand , before patriotism ceased to pay hard cash . And even now , little waves are lapping against the piling of the wharves , small , sparkling waves when the sun is bright and when the sky is blue above the marshes and the sand dunes . " Money , " they are saying , " money , money , money " ; but there 's no money in blue water now . And Haven 's End is cool and empty now , chill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the elm-lined street above the river , where the old square houses stand . It is a poverty so like the austerity of the first plantation that it is difficult sometimes to believe that our town once was rich enough to produce a culture of its own , drawn by itself from the sea . Only the houses are left to tell of that moment of its greatness , and now and then a bit of silver or a Chippendale chair . In the president 's office of the Ten Cents Savings Bank , Dennis Swale used to keep a heavy , dog-eared ledger that was the Charming Nancy 's log . Upon the battered calf cover was a round mark where Captain Daniel Swale had once set down his grog , and there were also little parallel cuts of a sharp knife blade , where Seth Scarlet had shaved off a twist of tobacco forp155his pipe , when those two shared the Charming Nancy 's cabin . There was no romantic reading in the pages . Daniel Swale , at the time he had reached his late twenties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harshness of that age , hovered the presence of a lonely man , self-reliant and aloof ; and over all that record of loss and gain and bloodshed was a simplicity close to greatness . There was an innocence between those lines that was almost gentle , and the vague imprint of a belief , close to the realm of mystical ,  --  the tranquil , unstained credulity of the man who dreams . On a stray leaf between the pages were the crew 's names , signed to the articles  --  the patient , trembling signatures of hard-handed illiterates ; blots and scratches , crosses . The Christian names were like a genealogy from the Old Testament . It was that strange piety of violence and godliness which no one but a Yankee could ever understand . " The crew , " wrote Daniel Swale , " is indifferent bad . " But there was another passage in that log . " We brought aboard the chest of specie . It will run to twenty thousand pounds . Also one sack of silver service , very good . Also brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeming she would be safer on our vessel than aboard a prize . " And then there was another passage , still more amazingfor a privateering log . It was written off one of those small West India islands which New Englanders in those days knew so well . " After dark , " it read , " putp156off in the longboat and back two hours later , married . Grog rationed to the crew . " And there was all that was left that was tangible of the love of Daniel Swale , which one may believe or not . But the pride of our town was in it and that unbridged gap between the Scarlets and the Swales . A broken heart was in it , and money that came easily and went fast . And a secret was in it , half spoken now and half forgotten , and a man 's honor and a family 's honor . They all lay in the pages of the Charming Nancy 's log . It happened this way , Job Willing said , when he was an old man and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known , for he was cabin boy in those days . They had changed the name of the George Tavern to the Liberty , but the gentlemen were the same harddrinking , genial gentlemen , ready to buy up a boy 's prize share , in whole or part , before he went aboard , at a price depending on the master and on the tonnage of the vessel . Down by the river they were working by lantern light , loading the Charming Nancy by Mr. Whistle 's wharf with her last supplies , and groups of men were standing listening in the dark , for the Charming Nancy was a fast sloop and Daniel was a lucky master . A mistingrain was beginning to fall and the night was very dark . " Boy , " said Captain Swale , " where are you , boy ? Go down to the cabin and fetch my cloak that 's lying on the chest . " The cabin was in disorder , because nothing was put to rights as yet ; the captain 's pistols and cutlass werep157on the table above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great folios of charts with inky covers , North and South America , Africa , the British Isles and France , and then the captain 's note and navigation books , and a heavy Bible and a volume of Milton 's poems . Opened , where he must have been reading , was the seaman 's " Vade Mecum " , London , 1744 , " Shewing how to prepare a Merchant Ship for a close fight by disposing of their Bulk-heads , Leaves , Coamings , Lookholes , etc . " At the foot of the companion ladder was a chest which must have just been left aboard by the new first officer , who would share the cabin . " Scarlet " , Job Willing could read in new red paint , upon the broad pine cover . The lockers were covered with the captain 's clothes and sea boots , but Job Willing found the cloak . " Will you have it on , sir ? " Job Willing asked . " No , " said the captain . " Follow me to the tavern , boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He walked up the street quickly , with his hat drawn over his eyes . He was a slender , nervous man , who appeared to pay no attention to the sounds and sights . " Good evening , sir , " said some one on the street . " Good luck go with you , sir . " The captain did not answer ; he did not turn his head . He was as proud and as close-mouthed as all the other Swales . He walked quickly toward the tavern , his hat pulled over his eyes , unconscious of the gentle rain . In the taproom it was very bright with candles ; a fire of birch logs had been newly lit and the air was full of the scent of birch smoke , sweet and oily . The taproom was filled with gentlemen , all talking ; owners and mer/chants , not masters , and the social difference was strong in those days between the master and the owner of a ship . In that company Job Willing felt out of place . The captain was standing very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see me , did you , Mr. Whistle ? " he asked . Then every one was turning , looking . The captain was not a handsome man ; he had the long Swale nose and their thin , hard mouth . His clothes were plain and drab ; with none of the embellishments of embroideryand lace that all the gentlemen wore who were seated at the tables . Mr. Whistle looked up and laid down his long clay pipe . He was an old man in those days , whose face was wan and wrinkled below his powdered wig . There were two strange gentlemen beside him , urbane and beautiful , whom job Willing had learned that afternoon were merchants from Boston and part owners in the CharmingNancy 's venture . " Ah , " said Mr. Whistle , " here he is , gentlemen . " One of the strangers stood up , young and well-proportioned , in a white satin waistcoat which was edged with bright gold braid . " So that 's the little fighting-cock ? " he said . The captain looked at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Mr. Whistle , " he 's as good a man as you could find . He 's been sailing for me ten years , mostly on the Guinea coast , and you know what that is , gentlemen . He 's the one to fight a ship . Manly and O'Brien are no better . " pI59 " And Swale his name is , is it ? " said the tall man . " Here 's at you , Captain . Come here . Sit down . " " Thanks , " said the captain , " I have not the time . " " Sit down , I tell you , " said the tall gentleman . And he reached forward , seizing the captain by the collar of his coat . " Take your hand off my coat , " said Captain Swale . " I tell you , take it off . " Mr. Whistle rose hastily , dusting the tobacco ash from his vest . " Mr. Jenks , " he said , " Captain Swale comes from an old family . We all have our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was older , with a mellow , booming voice . " The captain is a patriot , " he said . " To the devil with distinctions , when you meet a hero  --  yes , a hero . If I were young enough to strike a blow , I 'd be with you , Captain , working at the guns . " The captain shrugged his shoulders . " We 're not patriots , " he answered ; " we 're all in this for money . " " What ? " said the other gentleman . " What do you mean by that ? " And for the first time the captain smiled . " It 's money , " he said . " That 's what ships the crews , because men want money . " " Daniel , " said Mr. Whistle , " do n't you want it too ? " " That 's why I 'm going , " said Daniel Swale . " BecauseI want my own house up on the high street . I 'll have it and a coach , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Jenks . " I hope so . "  |p160The  captain looked down upon the floor and clasped his hands behind his back . " There 's no glory in it , " he answered . " That 's what I mean to say . We take the weak vessels and run from the strong . That 's the owner 's order . " " And now , " said Mr. Whistle , " is the crew aboard ? " " Yes , " said the captain , " a mangy crew . All the good ones are aboard the prison ships . " " Well , " said Mr. Whistle , " you 've sailed out with worse . And now about the mate , Daniel . We have a mate signed on for you . " " Who is he ? " asked the captain . Mr. Whistle coughed again . " It 's Seth Scarlet , " he said . The captain bit his lip . " Him ? " he asked . " You mean the landlord 's son ? " " Now , Daniel , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are hard to find . " " He drinks too much , " said Daniel Swale , " and talks too much . " " Now , Daniel , " said Mr. Whistle , " Mr. Scarlet wishes him to go and Mr. Scarlet is part owner . " " Very good , " said the captain . " Will he mind my orders ? " " Yes , " said Mr. Whistle . " You 'll find he is a good one . Knows the sea . And besides , it 's better he was gone because  --  " Mr. Whistle whispered something in the captain 's ear . " So he 's wenching again ? " said the captain . Mr. Whistle looked at Daniel Swale beneath his heavy brows . " Seth knows women , " said Mr. Whistle . " Sethp161knows when to run , and that 's the thing , believe me ,  --  to know when to run away . " The captain did not answer . It was clear he had no desire for the refreshment on the table . " Well , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving on this tide . " " He 's waiting here , " said Mr. Whistle . " Well , " said the captain , " bring him in . " And then Job Willing saw the new mate walk across the room , a red-faced , heavy-handed man , like all the Scarlets . I le was grinning and bowing like some one anxious to please . " So I 'm sailing with Danny , am I ? " he said . " Now there 's a rare one , gentlemen . I used to whip him when we were at school . " " Hold your tongue ! " the captain said . " Listen to him , " said Seth Scarlet . " We 've never pulled on the same rope yet , Danny Swale or me . " " Now come , " said Mr. Whistle . " You 're shipmates now . Fill the glasses up and here 's one to the cruise . " They stood about the table with glasses of Madeira in their hands , and just as they were about to drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elbow , for an instant later every one was looking at a stain upon the table where half the wine had spilled from Seth Scarlet 's glass . For a moment every one looked at each other , because times were uncertain and they were superstitious men ; and the captain spoke . " There 's the sign , " he said , " for an unlucky voyage . " They went to fight the British aboard a vessel of eighty tons , with sixty men as crew and an improvisedp162battery of twelve six-pounders , which were lashed beneathtarpaulins , behind ports cut in the bulwarks . They went to sea in a vessel scarcely more than a fishingsmack , and even that crew of gawky country boys , unversed in the subtleties of life , knew that the CharmingNancy was not large enough to hold a Scarlet and a Swale . Long before there was danger , there was trouble ; for the sea , in spite of all its space , was about them like bare , narrow walls , against which wills and wishes beat and gave back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality were bound to strain and creak in tune with the complaining of the CharmingNancy 's timbers . They were cooped up in the cabin aft , eating togetheroff a swinging table , sleeping each upon a mattressthrown upon a locker . There they were in a dismal , dripping place , with stands of cutlasses and small arms along unpainted bulkheads , in a space not more than eight by twelve feet , with a deck so low that Seth Scarlet struck his head if he stood upright . It was no place for a Scarlet and a Swale . Even the crew could tell that they were different breeds ; the captain cold , aloof , and Mr. Scarlet boisterous and friendly , like an ordinary man . If even the crew could guess it , Job Willing was the one who knew , because Job was the boy who brought the meals aft and who set the place to rights ; and a boy with sharp ears heard things which no one was meant to hear . Yet what he remembered afterwards was the silence of Daniel Swale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversationp163died , and the captain was left sitting staring at the wall ; or standing at the rail alone , looking at the sails . Even when he gave his orders , he was lonely , a thousand miles away . " Evening to you , Danny , " Mr. Scarlet said , when they sat down to table early on that cruise . " Seth , " the captain said , " it 's no matter here , but I 'll have you to call me Sir ' when we 're on deck . " " There you go , " said Mr. Scarlet ; " putting on airs , ai n't you ? " The captain made no answer . " You 're here to fight this ship , ai n't you ? " Mr. Scarlet said . " Not to bully me . " The captain stared over Mr. Scarlet 's head at the small-arms racks and drank his drink in silence . " D ' you hear me ? " Mr. Scarlet said . " My father 's part owner , so do n't you put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a skipper on a stinking nigger ship ?  --  you remember that . " The captain did not answer . " Damnation ! " Mr. Scarlet said . " Are n't you going to speak ? " And then he laughed , for he was not a man to stay angry long . " You 've got the manners , Dan . I have n't . But the Scarlets have the money . " " Yes , " the captain said . And he stared beyond Seth Scarlet at the wall . " Lord , " said Mr. Scarlet , " I 'd give a piece of it right now to know what 's on your mind . Are you alwaysthis way , never speaking , always thinking , Danny Swale ? " " Seth , " the captain said , " I 'll tell you this . The Swales will have money before I 'm through . "  | " And here 's to it , " said Mr. Swale . " Tip the glasses up . Here 's to money and the girls . " " Drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " you wo n't find any here . " Captain Swale would sit beneath the swinging lamp , writing in his log . " Clear weather , " he wrote , " fair , northwest breezes . Cleared ship for action twice . Crew indifferent poor . " " Boy ! " he shouted . " Boy  --  fetch out my blankets . What are you crying for , boy ? " " Nothing , if you please , sir , " Job Willing said . " No ? " said Captain Swale . " Do n't lie . You 're cryingto be back to Haven 's End . Do you mind the way the church bells ring ? " And all at once his voice was kind , and all at once the light was brighter , which had always played behind his face . " And you heard the fife and drum ? " he said . " Do n't be afraid of me . I was young when I first left . Tell me where you live , boy . I know Haven 's End . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote , as though it were an everyday affair . " Proved to be British brig Eclipse . Kingston to Halifax . Struck when we boarded after engagement of one glass . Lost fore topmast . Five killed  --  ten wounded . " That was all he wrote , but by the time they boarded , every one knew why seamen 's shares sold at a premium when Daniel Swale was captain . Daniel was the one who led them , with Seth Scarlet just behind him , but the fight was nearly over when the grappling hooks were thrown . The late afternoon sun beat on a deck cov/cred with blood and splinters , and a knot of men stood at the mainmast , but the rest had gone below . Daniel Swale was in his shirt sleeves , with a cutlass in his hand , but even then he seemed apart from all the rest , unshakenby the excitement of it , methodical , precise . " Daniel , " said Seth Scarlet , " it 's true what they say . You 're a great captain , Danny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll please to call me Sir ' on deck . Where 's the ship 's master ? Go down with him and see what 's in the cabin . " " Very good , sir , " said Seth Scarlet . " Well , it do n't make any difference . You know how to fight . " It was like a hundred affairs , up to then . Swale had been in enough before to know the whole routine . As Seth Scarlet and the master of the brig , a middle-aged man , who might have been a shopkeeper , moved away , Daniel Swale looked forward . The crew of the CharmingNancy were by the forecastle , where the prisoners were emerging one by one . " Stop there ! " shouted Daniel Swale . " Do n't take their money from their pockets . " " Huzzah for the captain ! " some one shouted . " Be silent forward , " roared out Captain Swale . And they obeyed him because they were afraid of him , and because the prize shares would be handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Charming Nancy was cast off . Already men were busy with repairs , when Seth Scarlet , came hack on deck . " Captain , " called Seth Scarlet , " will you please to step up here ? " He lowered his voice and his broad red face was puzzled . " There 's a woman in the cabin.  |p166Ho  , did you mind what you were saying ,  --  there 'd be no women here ? " To every man who lives there comes a moment sometimesof strange illumination , when all the world becomes a wish turned true , regardless of the truth . Seth Scarlet could not understand it , for he knew the type she was , that parody of stateliness , that unreserved complaisance which was old as time , when Babylon was young . It flashed between those two in a look of recognition . He knew what she was . She knew he knew . It was not for him to see the sublimity in Daniel Swale 's unworldliness . All he remembered was Daniel Swale in a dripping shirt , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek bones , staring at that lady from the sea . " By thunder ! " the captain of the Eclipse was saying . " Do n't take on so , Ma'am . They 'll use you right . " And then he lowered his voice . " Blimme ! " he murmured . " If you would n't think she 'd never seen a man . " The ship was rolling on a gentle sea and the dying sun was reflected from the water through the cabin windows in a fitful way , like the light of a faintly burning fire . That was how Daniel saw her first in that flickering , uncertain light , as stately as a vision , without the hollows in her cheeks , without the patient weariness in her eyes . The light played like a halo on that lady 's yellow hair , giving her a beauty like a white light against the hardness of . a thousand meager days . And there he stood staring at her , and no one guessed that he was staring at a wish of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her like a countryp167boy , for her dress was all blue satin , embroidered with little flowers in vines and sprays . And where could one find a standard for a lady such as she , when there was not her like in all of Haven 's End ? But the courtesy of Daniel Swale overcame the rudeness of staring . The silence was over in a moment . He took his eyes from her face and looked down at her hands , slender and white , with half a dozen rings . " Madam , " he said , " do not be afraid . " " No , " said Seth Scarlet , " you wait and see if we ai n't the bully boys . " " No , " said the master of Eclipse . " There , there , Ma'am . I told you when you shipped , times was uncertain-like . Why , look at this gentleman  --  if he is a Yankee , damn him , he wo n't let the crew lay a finger on you . There , there , Ma'am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice was as soft as though she sang a song , and she looked at Daniel Swale as though she could not understand him , and perhaps she never did . " Excuse me , sir ; I did n't mean to take on so . Are you a Yankee , sir ? " " Yes , Madam , " said Daniel Swale . And he bowed with a touch of color in his face . " And you , Master , will you give me your name and the papers ? " " Jenkins , " said the master , " Herbert Jenkins . And it was n't my fault the men would n't stand to it , once you come aboard . I done my best for the owners . The lady 's a passenger . " He looked at them and nodded . " None of my affair , except a passenger , passage paid for . Name , Denby  --  Honorable Amaryllis Denby , so she says . From the Jamaica station , bound to meet Sir Rodney Burke at Halifax . "  |p168Then  Seth Scarlet began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Honorable ? " he said . " Honorable , did you say ? " The lady looked at him with level eyes and turned her head . " Yes , " she answered , " Honorable . And Sir Rodney Burke 's my  --  uncle , if you have to know . " And then Seth Scarlet started . He was staring at Daniel Swale and there was no wonder that he could not understand . Daniel Swale was bowing again . " Madam , " he said . " I am very sorry . " " Thank you , sir , " she said , but she was looking at Seth Scarlet . " Will you have some refreshment while your man is pulling things about ? " " Thank you , Madam , " Daniel bowed again , " but we are pressed for time . Madam , we have no way to entertain a lady , but you will be safer with us than on a half-manned prize . If you will pack a box , it will be carried aboard . I  --  " he paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think of , like any other captain . " She looked at him and nodded very graciously . It all was like some fantastic play , when she nodded to Daniel Swale . " Well , " she said , " beggars ca n't be choosers , sir . " In the meanwhile Seth Scarlet stared , and moved about the cabin , looking here and there , but suddenly he paused and bent above a chest . " Here ! " he said . " There 's no manifest for this . What 's in it ? Where 's the key ? " Captain Jenkins frowned and cleared his throat . " Only personal gear , " he said . " That 's all . " " Is it so ? " said Seth Scarlet . " Now , do n't you trickp169us . Do n't we know you were in a convoy before the blow ? Open it up or we 'll smash it in . It 's what Goldilocks here said  --  beggars ca n't be choosers . " The captain drew a bag from his pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shout . " Danny ! " he said . " Blast us , but we 're rich men , Danny ! " There was no wonder that Daniel Swale 's eyes narrowedas he looked . The box was full of gold  --  more than he had ever seen or hoped to see . The light from the gold seemed to shine upon his face , and for a moment his lips trembled . " It 's specie , " said the master heavily . " I told them fools it was n't safe . Twenty thousand pounds of specie  --  and they would n't hold the deck . " And then , suddenly , his face sagged and his body sagged , and he bent his head above the table and began to weep . Daniel Swale drew in a breath that was almost like a sigh , and he , too , seemed shaken by some emotion . " Lock up that box , " he said . " Send four men down to get it . " Daniel Swale , himself , was smiling , once he came on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had a way of seeing everything at once , and already his mind was moving forward . Yet somehow , any one could tell that he had changed , because that cloak of loneliness had left him before some unknown spell . " Ah ! " said Seth . " But you 're a cool one , sir , and it 's manners all the time . It was all I could do not to bust out laughing , you bowing and scraping as though she was a lady . "  | " What ! " the captain said , " what do you mean by that ? " " No , " said Seth Scarlet . " What 's she doing on a trading brig , traveling all alone ? You 've been born long enough to know just what I mean . " Daniel Swale stared at him for a moment , and once he opened his lips , only to close them before he finally spoke . " I do n't , " he said , " and perhaps it 's just as well , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aboard , if you ca n't tell good blood when you see it . " Then Seth Scarlet must have known , because his broad , heavy mouth fell open , and his eyes grew wide . " Danny , " he said , " have you lost your wits ? " And then he stopped , because the look of Daniel Swale made him stony silent , and he stood as though he saw an amazing sight that lay beyond his furthest thoughts . He was staring at what stood behind the hardness and the silence . It was there where any one might see  --  the ignorance and the gentleness of Daniel Swale . She must have marveled too . He was beyond the realm of her sophistication and of the brilliance that shone from her , when she talked of this and that in London ; and she had seen it all . And she was beautiful , even to one who did not long for land , that lady from the sea . As she sat in the Charming Nancy 's cabin , it seemed like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no hope for Daniel Swale , and the end was very clear.  |p171They  put her in the cabin , all alone , and the officersslept forward with the crew . But they ate with her in the cabin of the same boiled , salt meat the crew ate , ending with pasty raisin pudding , washed down by rum and water . It was a marvelous picture , that cabin with the smoky , fish-oil lantern swaying overhead , the small arms rattlingin their racks and Amaryllis Denby with rings upon her fingers seated before a wooden trencher , while Seth Scarlet chewed his victuals savagely and Daniel Swale drank his rum and water . The captain never asked her how she came upon a trading brig , traveling alone in time of war , because he accepted her like the sunrise after a stormy night . It was marvelous to see the captain rise and bow . " Madam , " he said , " we will leave you now . No one will disturb you unless we sight a sail . " " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay and smoke your pipe . " " Ay , " said Seth Scarlet , " to be sure he 'll stay . " Even when he believed the innocence , he could not believe the chivalry of Daniel Swale . But Daniel Swale did not touch her ; he would as soon have touched an image of the Virgin . " Captain , " she said , " tell me who you are . " For a moment he looked at her diffidently . " I am a Yankee trader , Madam , " he said . " Mostlytoward the Guinea coast until the war began . But I'llbe a ship 's owner some day , unless I die . " She sat with her chin in the palm of her hand and for some reason he was not ill at ease when she gazed at him thoughtfully , with a wrinkle between her brows.  | " But you 're a gentleman , if you are a Yankee , " she said . " Not like that officer of yours ! " She shrugged her shoulders and made a face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at her for long . He could not forget that they were in the cabin all alone . " Madam , " he said , " I 've always bought and sold . I know the value of this and that , but the Swales are gentle people . We are the Swales from Norwich . " " Oh , " she said , " the Norwich Swales ? When I stayed at Dean Manor once , there was a Swale . " " Was there ? " said Daniel . " Was there now ? " And then he told her of the Swales at Haven 's End , of Colonel Richard Swale , who had led his regiment in King Philip 's War ; he told her of the great house that Colonel Swale had built , and of the Colonel 's steel cap and breastplate that hung above the chimney at home . If she was amused , she did not show it , because she had skill enough for that , but there must have been a transparency in him which amazed her from the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swales . " We 're poor now , " he said . " It 's a trading town . " All the while that lady seemed lost in some thought that puzzled her . She kept looking at him curiously from beneath half-lowered eyelids , as though she waited for something that did not happen , and finally she pointed at the chest upon the cabin floor . " And how much of that will you have ? " she asked . " Madam , " he answered , " I should have two thousandpounds when I get home . " And then he told her of Haven 's End , because her glance was kind . He told her of the marshes wherep173the wild fowl came in and of the sturgeon in the river . He told her of the sleigh rides on winter nights and of the dancing in the tavern . He told her of the great houses that were being built and of the prizes that were coming to the wharves and , as he spoke , he seemed to see the streets in a new glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all the while she listened , half perplexed , because she did not understand . " And are there any red Indians ? " she asked . " I thought the Americas were forests , always filled with Indians . Is it true that all the men sing psalms ? " " Madam , " said Daniel Swale , " the Indians come in , with deer and beaver pelts , but only a very few . Listen  --  you can hear the watch singing now , the Hundred and Third Psalm from the old music book . " And then they were silent , for he could think of nothing more to say , and all about them was the creaking of wood and all the noises of a ship at sea . And he felt that her eyes were on him , though he could not look . He could not look because of her nearnessand her helplessness and because the softness of her voice was temptation , though she was so fine a lady . " You 'll be a great man in your town , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Madam , " he said , " you have seen so many greater men . " " I am not so sure , " she said . " Good night to you , Captain Swale . " She held out her hand , covered with its rings of red stones and of green , and they flashed like firep174before his eyes . At the touch of her hand , as he bent over it , his blood was like fire . She seemed to be drawing him beyond himself , into a place of laughter and shining floors , where candles shone on diamonds and where there was an odor of lavender and roses . " Good night to you , Madam , " he said . " Captain Swale , " she answered , " you are a very gentle man . " When he was on deck , he stood for a long while looking at the sea , where the bows cut the black water into a feather of light . " Ah , Captain , " said Seth Scarlet , " will you be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Daniel Swale , " Ca n't you tell a lady when you see one ? " " Maybe not , " Seth Scarlet said , " but I 'll tell you one thing straight , and it 's bad , black luck for you . You love her , Danny Swale , and you 're the fool , not me . " Seth Scarlet was the one who needed more than a lady 's hand to kiss and Daniel Swale was the one who heard her scream . It was past midnight and black , rainy weather , when Seth Scarlet had the watch on deck . Daniel Swale was in the cabin in a moment , and there was the Lady Amaryllis Denby , white-faced , wide-eyed , struggling in Seth Scarlet 's arms . " You ! " said Daniel Swale . " Go up on deck . " Even in his anger , his voice was level , but Seth Scarlet must have known that anything might happen . Nevertheless , he tried to laugh in the absurdity of that moment. z75 " Danny , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see she likes it ? " " Go up on deck , " said Daniel Swale . But even then , Seth Scarlet tried , purely out of kindness , to tell him . There was no use , but still Seth Scarlet tried . " By thunder , " he cried , " do n't you see what she 's after ? She started screaming just to get you here . " Daniel Swale reached toward the arms rack . " Seth , " he said , and still his voice was level , " I do n't want trouble over this . I 'm being patient , Seth . " " Very good , " Seth Scarlet 's voice was thick . " Very good , sir , but do n't say I did n't put in my word  --  and you 'll be sorry until the day you die . " Daniel must have been the only one who did not know what was to follow , because , by then , it was as inevitable as time . Yet to the very end , he stumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 've been afraid of this . You must not blame him too much . Men are like that . It 's  --  the loneliness  --  " " Yes , " she answered . Her hands were trembling , as she twisted up her hair . " Yes , I know . " Daniel Swale cleared his throat . " Our course is close to the islands , " he said . " I can put you ashore , perhaps . I think you would be safer there , unless  --  " " Unless ? " she took up his word haltingly , and Daniel bowed his head . " I suppose you 'll laugh , " he answered , " because I 'm very plain . Will you forgive me ? I was about to say  --  unless we married . "  |p176There  was not a sound but the groaning of the Charming Nancy 's timbers in that eternal complaint of ships , a moaning , dirgelike sound , but the sweetness of her voice was what he heard . " I 'll make you a good wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . And next , before the thing seemed possible , her head was on his shoulder and her soft gold hair was on his coat . Although he was a trader , who knew short weights , he never asked her who she was . One can imagine what Seth Scarlet must have thought . He did not see the beauty of it or the sadness of it . When the longboat came from shore that night , Seth Scarlet watched it , grinning , and he bowed before her in a parody of pleasure . " My congratulations , Madam ! " he said . " You have found a good man . " And he turned to shake the captain by the hand . In the happiness that was upon him , how should Daniel have noticed that his lady 's face had blushed scarlet ? Her hand had closed tight on his , with a new ring on it of plain gold . Then Daniel Swale was laughing ; all his loneliness and all his repression were gone for a little time , lost in that dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lover 's thought . It was not for Daniel Swale to guess what she was , and he would have died sooner than believe it . And when he believed , he wished that he was dead , but it was too late to die . When His Majesty 's privateer Enterprise came upp177with the Charming Nancy after a six hours ' chase , Daniel Swale would have fought her , if his crew had stood up to fight , but they were only country boys , who were making their first cruise . They ran below at the first broadside , forcing Daniel Swale to strike , and the boats of the Enterprise brought them off , a frightened lot of boys , with Mills Prison staring them in the face . Daniel Swale , his lady , Seth Scarlet , the box of specie and the Charming Nancy 's log crossed in the last boat and Captain Bligh of the Enterprise received them on his deck . Captain Bligh , in his middle thirties , with puffy eyes and small , plump hands , was in dress uniform when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck . " Gad ! " said Captain Bligh . " So you did n't choose to fight your ship ? I 'd have fought , if I were you . Oh , gad , what have we here ? " He had seen Daniel Swale 's lady , but he did not remove his hat . " Gad ! " said CaptainBligh , " Now here 's a pleasant meeting . Damme , if it is n't Lady Amaryllis  --  and in a Yankee boat . Oh , Amaryllis , tell me , are n't you true to your first loves ? " Disgrace had made Daniel Swale silent until then , but anger gave him back his tongue . " Have you no courtesy , sir ? " he said . " The lady is my wife . " And then his face went white , for Captain Bligh was seized with a sudden fit of laughter . " Capital , " said Captain Bligh , " that 's capital . But it does not go with me . " " Sir , " said Daniel Swale , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be a fool , " said Captain Bligh . " She 's every/body 's wife . Damme , I know Lady Amaryllis , do n't I ? There 's no ensign in Portsmouth who does n't know her . " " Sir , " said Daniel Swale , " I tell you she 's my wife . " Captain Bligh 's mouth fell open . " Oh , good God , you did n't marry her now , not Amaryllis ? Amaryllis is an officer 's lady . Speak up and tell him , dear . " Daniel Swale took one look at her , and one look was enough , even for Daniel Swale . It seemed as though the words had dragged her in the dirt . She was not weeping ; instead her face was drawn into lines ugly and horrible , and her voice was a shrieking discord . " You beast ! " she cried . " You filthy beast , Bob Bligh . " Then Seth Scarlet began to laugh , although he should have known it was not a laughing matter . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you , Dan Swale . " Daniel Swale stood for a moment staring , while Seth Scarlet laughed and Captain Bligh began to laugh again , and then he must have forgotten where he was , for he jumped at the captain 's throat . It was so quick and unexpected that they fell to the deck together , but in an instant it was over . The second officer of the Enterprise ran up , fetching Daniel Swale a blow on the temple with a pistol butt , and Daniel Swale lay deathly white , face upward on the deck . " You beast ! " screamed Lady Amaryllis . " Oh , you beast ! " Captain Bligh was getting to his feet , dusting at his coat . " Put both these men in irons , " he said . " Iron them in the hold with their crew . Lady Amaryllis , shall you and I be sensible ? I would , if I were you . " I79When Daniel Swale opened his eyes , he was in the hold with the crew of the Charming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was leaning over him . " You 're alive , are you ? " Seth Scarlet said . " Yes , " said Daniel Swale , " yes , I 'm alive . " Then Seth Scarlet began to laugh , not because he was merry , but because his nerves were shaken . " The joke 's on you , " he said . " I wish you could have seen your face . The joke 's on you , Dan Swale . " Daniel sat up and his voice was very faint . " Laugh again and I 'll kill you , " he said . His head sank back against the planking . " I  --  " his voice was hardly more than a whisper , " I 'm going to take this ship . " Like all the other Scarlets from Haven 's End , Seth was plain and plodding . He could not know the tormentin the mind of Daniel Swale . " Dan , " he said , " you 've not got your senses back . You 're lying here with your head broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a little painted hussy that any man could see was no better than she should be ? Wait till they hear about it back at Haven 's End . Rememberyou 're in irons , Danny Swale . " Daniel Swale sat up again , weak in body and weak in voice , but it startled Seth Scarlet to hear him , because he could not understand the driving force of will , or the sublimation of stubbornness that was speaking in the dark . " These irons , " said Daniel Swale , " these irons , " and he shook them on his wrist . " We have better irons in the Guinea trade and I 've seen the black boys pick the locks . I 've seen them . I know how . "  | " Are you crazy ? " said Seth Scarlet . " Are you crazy , Danny Swale ? " " There 's a nail in my pocket , " Daniel Swale answered . " When my head is better , I can pick the locks . " Seth Scarlet stared at him in silence through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swayed by the contagion of that feeble voice . " If I get you free , " said Daniel Swale , " where do you want to go , men  --  to the prison or back to Haven 's End ? " Then , if they had never known it before , they felt his spirit , rising from the embers into flame . " Scarlet , " he asked , " did you see ? Where did she go ? " He was thinking of her still . " Lord , sir ! " said Seth Scarlet . He was swayed at last by the unreality of it . " She 's up there in the cabin . Now do n't take on . Just sit quiet , Captain . " " Is she ? " said the captain . " Is she so ? Now listen . Do what I tell you and I 'll have you out of this . D' you hear me ? I tell you I 'll get you out of this . . . " Long afterward , when Daniel Swale told of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination of audacityand luck , distilled from his imagination . He and his carpenter ripped off the hinges from the bulkheaddoor one night , which led to the cabin aft . They worked it back a foot , and Daniel Swale got through and pulled the bolts , and went for Captain Bligh . Captain Bligh went down without a moan , and , with the small arms in the cabin , all the rest was easy . Even when it ended , he did not seem to realizep181what they had done . He stood on the deck in the lantern light , staring at the dark . " Damn you for thieves ! " he shouted . " Do n't take their money from their pockets . Boy , serve out a round of grog . Mr. Scarlet ! Scarlet  --  are you there ? " " Aye , sir , " said Mr. Scarlet . " Give him a cheer now . Have you lost your tongues ? " " Stop your bellowing ! " That was the only answer the captain made . " Mr. Scarlet , set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't finished yet . " There was no wonder that Seth Scarlet could not understand ; it was the way always with the Starlets and the Swales . Captain Bligh still was dazed by the time Daniel Swale reached his cabin . One of his officers was tied there with him and two lay dead on deck . " Take out the other gentleman , " he said . " Where is the lady gone ? " " She 's here , confound her ! " groaned Captain Bligh . " She held a pistol on me . And so help me , I wish she 'd pulled the trigger , if you want to know . " Then Daniel Swale saw her , standing there , with all her airs gone , wide-eyed . He looked at her and back at Captain Bligh . " Untie him , Mr. Scarlet , if you please , " he said and rested his hand upon the cabin table . " It 's all right , my dear . It 's quite all right . " Though Daniel was never a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wound on his head was unwashedand black . " Captain Bligh , " he said.  | " Yes , " said Captain Bligh . " What do you want now ? " " When I saw you last , " said Daniel Swale , " you made some remarks on this lady , my wife . " " By gad , sir ! " said Captain Bligh . Seth Scarlet had untied him and he was on his feet . " I did not know she was your wife . " " But you know it now , " said Daniel Swale . " And we held different opinions , unless you 've changed your mind . I hold she is a lady of unblemished reputation . " " A what ? " said Captain Bligh . " A lady of unblemished reputation , " repeated Daniel Swale . " Do you agree with me ? " " I 'm damned if I agree ! " shouted Captain Bligh . " What the devil are you doing now ? Do you mean to kill me , sir ? " Daniel Swale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin table . " Captain Bligh , " he said , " take your place at the end of the table , please . Mr. Scarlet has not a handkerchief ; will you kindly lend him yours ? " " Yes , " said Captain Bligh . " What do you mean to do ? " " Sir , " said Daniel Swale , " we are sailing for Haven 's End . My wife shall be what I say she is when I reach there . When Mr. Scarlet here says three , we will reach across the table , take a weapon , cock and fire . " " Sir , it 's murder , " said Captain Bligh . And then the lady spoke . " Daniel , " she began . " My dear , " said Daniel Swale , " will you please be still . Mr. Scarlet , will you please count three and drop the handkerchief ? "  |p183Seth  Scarlet 's hand was trembling and his voice was as unsteady as his hand . " Daniel , " he said , " there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word . " " I 'll be damned if I will ! " shouted Captain Bligh . " She 's a common light of love . Count out and I 'll stick to it . " At the last number they both reached forward and straightened back , but as they did so the vessel gave a lurch . The lantern , swinging from overhead , wavered ; both men lost their balance , but Captain Bligh regained his first and fired . The cabin was a roar of noise and smoke and they both were standing by the cabin table , and Scarlet asked : " Are you all right , Daniel Swale ? " " Load the pistols , Mr. Scarlet , if you please , " Daniel said . He was leaning forward against the table , gripping it hard with both his hands . Captain Bligh had taken a step backward and his eyes were round . " Man ! " he said hoarsely . " Have n't you had enough ? " " No , " said Daniel Swale . " Load the pistols , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the smoke as though he saw a ghost . " Have I hit you , sir ? " he asked . Daniel Swale gazed back . And they all must have had a glimpse of what went on behind his eyes . " I 'm able to stand , " he answered , " and will go on with it . I 'll have my wife a lady if I 'm to take her home . " Then they must have understood , for his wish nop184longer seemed absurd . Though they might not have known it then , he was a sublimation of the Swales , with all their stupidity and with their stubbornness . All at once nothing seemed impossible , as Daniel Swale stood clutching at the table 's edge with his thin white hands . " My dear sir , " said Captain Bligh , and his manner changed without his own volition , " I was mistaken . I never knew your wife . She , as far as I 'm concerned , she 's as pure as the driven snow . " " Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see you understand . " " Certainly , " said Captain Bligh . " There will be no word spoken of it , not a word . If you 'd put it to me plain , there 'd have been no need to fight about it . " " Thank you , " said Daniel Swale . " And now , no doubt , you 'll beg the lady 's pardon . " " How ? " said Captain Bligh . " Must I do that ? " " If you please ! " said Daniel Swale . Then all three were looking at her , where she stood with the color back in her cheeks again . The words of Daniel Swale had made a change in her ; she was taller , more aloof , like a fine lady on a Gainsborough canvas . " Madam , " said Captain Bligh , " I mistook you for some one else , an unpardonable mistake , of course , but I ask your pardon .

" She 'll be a princess , if you say so , back at Haven 's End . " " Thank you , " said Daniel Swale . " Take Captain Bligh on deck . " Daniel Swale sank down upon a locker . Blood was dripping from his left sleeve , but he did not seem to notice ; he was staring at the cabin wall , watching some vision which his own thoughts made . Down on her knees beside him that lady was reaching for his hand . " Daniel , " she said . " Daniel . " " Yes , my dear , " he answered , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , " it 's true .

"  |p189IT  SEEMS ONLY A YEAR OR TWO AGOthat Washington Cuffy would be standing beside his hack to meet the evening train at Haven 's End . His hair was gray and kinky ; his old silk hat had faded to a rusty color , not unlike his face , and he was the end of one of those strange tales which are half alive in our town still . The fifties and the abolitionist era hovered uncertainlyabout him , and the Missouri Compromise and all the glowing periods of Webster and of Hayne . And there was something else , older by far than that . When the train came in , all the wrinkles in WashingtonCuffy 's cheeks and eyes would curl upward , each one in a smile , and up would go his hand to the brim of that preposterous hat in a gesture of the old regime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say , and his voice would be clear and deep like a bar of music . And there would be Dennis Swale , his eveningp190paper rolled like a diploma in his hand , stout and middle-aged . His face was growing identically like the face of Matthew Swale when he was old . The resemblancewas surprising , if you recalled the portrait in the dining room of the Swale house . The turned-up collar of Dennis ' overcoat was like the great white collar of Matthew Swale . The nose of Dennis Swale was the same long nose , sharp and slightly sinister . The mouth was the same , small and close ; the eyes the same , deep-set and keen . " Good evening , Washington , " Dennis Swale would say , and sometimes he would add , " so there you are . " And there they were upon the station platform beneath the smoky lamps , the son of Malachi Cuffy and the son of Matthew Swale . They must have recalledthe story , sometimes that white man and that black man , for the memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You could find the letter which Matthew Swale once wrote in the files of the old Gazette , December , 1852 . The Swale money , like other New England fortunes had turned from the sea to the cotton industry . It was natural that Matthew Swale should take a conservative stand , when the Fugitive Slave Act was passed a decade before the Rebellion . Whenever there was a conservative side in our town , one could always find a Swale . Sir : I am criticized for holding views contrary to the theories promulgated by certain abolitionists . Do those gentlemen  --  pI91I use the term with hesitation  --  forget that the production of cotton is founded upon the institution of slavery ? If that institution is the error of our forefathers , it is a necessary evil now . I paraphrase the words of a clergyman when I say that I should feel it my duty to turn from my door a fugitive slave , un f ed , unaided in any way , rather than set at naught the law of the land . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hard old man . " It never occurred to Dennis that he might be hard himself . " Yes , " Dennis Swale would say , and he would tell the story as accurately as an antiquarian , " I was too young to understand it , of course , but my brother Richard gave me the facts . It seems that a man named Scarlet headed the mob . They came up from those cabins by the railroad tracks , called Little Guinea . " And there was a strange name for you . All the pieces came together once you heard that name  --  Malachi , and the letter , and the face of Matthew Swale . Beside the railroad tracks , hidden from the older streets , you could see the unpainted houses of Little Guinea . They named it Little Guinea when there was a Guinea coast  --  but those were matters which one seldom speaks of and only the name is left to hint of a forgotten business . " Yes , " said Dennis Swale , " they came up from Little Guinea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " 192p192The Swale house must have been a fine place for a boy . It was becoming an old house , when Dennis ' brother Richard was young , and Richard Swale was old enough to die at Fredericksburg . When Richard told Dennis about it , Dennis was of an age when sights and sounds stay clear . Dennis could remember his brother 's uniform , with the state shield on its buttons , and the slope of Richard 's cap , and the hopeless look in Richard 's eyes . Richard must have known he would not see the house again . " You must n't mind the old man , " Richard said . " Why , damn it , you 'll miss his hiding you some day . This is a fine place for a boy . " The shadows of the Swale house and the peace of the gardens were like sounds to Richard Swale , and he was a part of it when he was a boy , as much as the elm trees on the lawn and the eagle on the cupola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that country was his own . All the narrow passageways were his , and the attic filled with discarded Chippendale and cowhide trunks , where the dust would dance in the sunbeams , never wholly still . " Forever poking in the attic , forever nosing in the passages , " Richard said to Dennis . " Brother , you ought to know . Do n't the hinges always squeak ? Do n't the halls grow very large at dusk ? And in the morning  --  there 's the time , the very early morning . . . . Lord , the old man was angry . . . and he was heartier then . " It was very early in the morning , Richard said , when he woke with a sense that time was moving fast ; and there he was in his trundle bed in his little room193p193that looked from under the cornice toward the river . I t was April , and down below  --  it seemed a long way down  --  the lawn was sodden and weary from the winter  --  and the air was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no long matter in those days when he was fourteen . In not much more than three minutes he was in his boots and breeches , and he was thinking  --  it seemed natural enough : " You 're going to the attic , " he was thinking . " You 've time to see the attic before the breakfast bell . " There was still a grayness in the hall , as though the night had not escaped as yet , and by the landing he could look over the balustrade down the three flights of flying staircase . He could hear his father 's voice and then the voices of the children from the nursery , but the attic was asleep , always , day and night , asleep . That morning was when Richard found those iron things in the faint , fresh light . He could remember the heavy coldness of them and the clinking of the chains , musical and soft , and all the morning went about them like a frame . They were in a pine chest , he remembered , the lid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there was a smell of camphor and old leather and unpainted wood . It was the sea chest of Captain Daniel Swale . Richardhad never ventured to open it before . First there were some volumes of charts , such as were in the library downstairs  --  giving directions for the African coast . The compass bearings on the maps were like the lines of a spider 's web , and profiles of the land194p194were like a child 's book of pictures , showing " The Ivory Coast , New Callabar and the Islands of FernandoPoo "  --  in the silence of the morning those names might have been of lands as distant as the moon . " When you see the highest of the cliffs , " Richard read , " with a crooked Tree appearing like an UmbrellaNE. by N. and NNE. from you , then you are not far from the shore in 17 and 15 Fathom of good sandy Ground . You 'll see also a great Forest beset round with Palm-Trees . From thence The Blacks will bring fresh water in pots . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the silence of the attic he had the strangest feeling . The words were like a voice  --  exactly like a voice . His hand , as he groped in the box , encountered something hard that rattled . He pulled and pulled again . As he did so , that smell of pine and camphor and decaying leather was all about him and in his hands were two chains . They were crossed like an X , fastened at the intersection , and at each extremity was an iron ring that locked . They clanked and rattled as he dragged them on the floor . A shaft of sunlight was coming through the window and the dust was swirling in the light in nervous little eddies . There was no sound , but all at once his heart had started to his throat , because he could have sworn there was something in the attic besides himself . His heart was in his throat and then the breakfast bell was ringing. 195p195His father was in the dining room , seated before the silver coffee urn , reading from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head up very straight ; his watch and fob were on the table , and he held his cup of coffee halfway to his lips . " You 're late , " said Matthew Swale . " Ca n't you hear ? Do they have to ring the bell fit to wake the dead to bring you down ? " " Father  --  " began Richard . " Sit down , " said Matthew Swale . " Breakfast 's gettingcold . " " Father , " said Richard , " what are these things ? " " What things ? " said Matthew Swale . And then he saw them . Richard was holding them up so that they were dangling against the background of the sideboard and the silver . There was a minute before his father spoke , or the time seemed as long as that . His father wiped his fingers with his napkin very carefully . " Where , " he said and stopped to clear his throat , " where did you come on that ? " " Up in the attic , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box . " His father wiped his lips with his napkin very carefully . " In a box ? " said Matthew Swale . " What box ? " Then his voice had dropped almost to a whisper . " Get up . Put ' em back where you found ' em , boy , before the servants see ' em . No , wait . Here comes your mother . Give those things to me . " I le snatched them out of Richard 's hand and tossed them clanking beneath the table.  | " Do n't mind what they were ; they were your greatgrandfather 's , " he said . " Did I tell you or did I not , not to meddle in the attic ? " " Yes , " said Richard . " Yes , you told me , sir . " His mother moved to the table in a rustling sound of silk . Her black , plaited hair made her look very pale , and you could imagine that she was floating on that rustling sound . She was poorly that morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had heard them say that very soon she would not come downstairs at all . " I 'm sorry , dear , " she said , " that I 'm too late to pour your coffee . " Matthew Swale looked at her without speaking , but she must have read his look . " Do n't worry , " she said . " I 'm feeling better . And you ca n't help it , if I 'm not . " " Ca n't I ? " said Matthew Swale . " Ca n't I ? Richard , pull back your mother 's chair . " She was laughing , and she seemed to draw away on the sound of her laughter until she was wiser than them all . " I wish to God , " said Matthew Swale , " you would n't laugh about it . " Her lips were still half parted in a smile , and , in that instant , she seemed very young . " Matthew , " she said , " I wish to God that other people knew that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had a way with him , because she had never been afraid . " It does n't matter , " he said slowly , " what other people think . "  | " I suppose , " she said , " that you know what they 're saying . " Before he answered , his father walked to the fireplace and back , with his quick , nervous stride . " It makes no difference what any one says , " he answered . " The only thing to do in these days is to stand by one 's conviction , and I 'll stand . " What he would stand for , Richard could not guess , but his mother must have known . " It makes no difference where one stands , " she said . " It 's all the same , as long as one is kind . " llis father did not answer , but all at once he did a startling thing . He lied . It was the first and only time that Richard heard him lie . He picked up the chains from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Richard noticed that his face flushed into a wintry pink . " The chain 's snapped on the hitching post , " he said . " I 'll have to get another . That 's the trouble with this house . It 's getting much too old . Everything keeps breaking . " " Matthew , " said Richard 's mother , " Matthew . " " Yes , " his father answered quickly . " Yes , what is it ? " " Pomp is ill , " she said , " down in Little Guinea . " " He 's getting old , " said Matthew Swale . " Everything'stoo old . Richard , come with me . " His mother turned ; her head was raised in a question before she spoke , and all sorts of words were in her eyes . The beauty that was leaving her and the strength that was leaving her were in her eyes.  | " What do you want with Richard ? " his mother asked . " I want to speak to him . That 's all , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and her shoulders shook with one of her noiseless fits of coughing . " What has he done wrong ? " " Nothing , " he said . " The boy 's all right . " " I 'm glad , " she said . " You must be gentle , Matthew , when I 'm not here to make you . " His father drew a deep breath as though he were about to speak , but the pantry door had opened before he could begin . Bridget , one of the Irish maids , was standing in the dining room , twisting at her apron . " If you please , sorr  --  if you please , there 's after being a big black man , a negur like , in the kitchen wants to see you . " " Well , what does he want ? " said Matthew Swale . " About caring for the horses , sorr , " said Bridget . " Pomp being took sick , sent him down . " " Send him to the library , " said Matthew Swale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door of the library softly . The chains were still in his hand , bundled in his napkin . Before he spoke , he strode over to his block-front secretary , tossed the bundle into the lower drawer , locked it and placed the key in his waistcoat pocket . " Richard , " he said . " Richard . " " Yes , sir , " Richard answered . " You 'll not tell your mother what you found . " " No , " said Richard . " No , I 'll not tell her , sir . " The colored man of whom Bridget had spoken came199p199into the library and closed the door behind him , brushingat his frayed , patched coat . The man was tall ; his skin was the same color as the black mahogany of the block-front desk , and it glistened in the light . His face was broad , the mouth like a scar , the nose flat , the eyes wide and melancholy . Negroes were not a strange sight and yet Richard alwaysremembered that the man seemed strange . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and something went stirring in Richard 's mind , and then he recollected what it was . " They come a great way aboard with little boats . " Matthew Swale stood beside the desk , looking the black man up and down . " Well , " said Matthew Swale , loudly as one speaks to a foreigner , " what do you want ? " The Negro shuffled his feet and moved his head and sighed . The door was just behind him , and on either side were cases filled with books , and then there was the portrait of Daniel Swale in his sea cloak , and pictures of two ships done in oil . The black man sighed again . " Pomp sent me , sah , " he said . " He say fo ' me to ' tend the hosses . " His voice was low and even when he finished speaking , it left an echo in the room . " Well , what 's your name ? " said Matthew Swale . " Malachi , sah , " the black man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Where do you come from ? " said Matthew Swale . " You do n't belong in town . " " From Virginia , sah , " said Malachi . " I done come from Virginia way . " 200 " Well , " said Matthew Swale . " What are you doing here ? " " Searchin ' fo ' work , sah , " said Malachi . He smiled , so that his face all turned to wrinkles . " I knows horses , I do . I 've driven for the quality . " " What quality ? " said Matthew Swale . " I'se ' ud rather not say , if yo ' please , sah , " Malachi Cuffy said . " Why ? " said Matthew Swale . " Sah ? " said Malachi . " You heard me , " said Matthew Swale . " Do you think I 'll hire a servant who wo n't say where he 's worked ? " " Sah , " said Malachi , " I 'm powerful good with horses . I be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and you 're a powerful good black liar . You tell Pomp from me not to send any more black tramps here . " " Yes , sah , " said Malachi . " Pomp , he done send me . Pomp , he says yo ' might help me , if yo ' please , sah . I come from very far . " " And they 're looking for you , " said Matthew Swale ; " I 'll wager that . " The black man did not move at first , but his expressionchanged and Richard remembered how it was . His eyes became sharp with a sudden glint of fear . His hand made a quick , spasmodic gesture and he shrank backward until his shoulders touched the door . " Please , sah , " he said . His voice was low and soft . " Be off with you , " said Matthew Swale . " Please , sail ! " the black man said , and Richard was ap20Ifrightened then . Malachi 's eyes were glowing . They were suddenly hard , intent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swale . Then he was gone . A moment before , he had been standing in front of the gray panels of the library door and next , though the door was closed , Richard could almost believe he saw him still , tall and black , with that strange light in his eyes . " Father , " said Richard , " what made him look like that ? " His father must have had the memory too , for he also stood looking at the door . " The man 's a runaway , " his father said . " And confoundedugly too . Go out . Your mother 's calling . " His mother was in the dining room , seated just as they had left her . When he came in , she gave her head a little shake and brushed quickly at her shawl . " Richard , " she said , " there 's a basket in the kitchen . Will you take it down to Pomp ? " " Yes , " said Richard . " Now ? " " It 's Saturday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , you know the house in Little Guinea . " Richard knew the house . As long as he could rememberanything , Pomp had been working at the harness and brushing down the horses as he sang beneath his breath . " Yes , I 'll go , " said Richard , but , as he turned , his mother called him back . " Richard , " his mother said , " did your father see that poor black man ? " Richard nodded. 202 " He 's gone , " he said . " Gone ? " said his mother . " I saw him in the hall . I wonder where he 's gone . " But how should Richard Swale have known ? " He was like a lost soul , " she said , " a poor lost soul , and he was frightened . I can tell , because I 'm frightenedtoo . There 's something  --  something terrible going to happen . Richard , I 'm afraid . " The Unseen Things were moving . Not the wind , but unseen things were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hurry . The sun was out in a soft blue sky . A northwest breeze , still bearing on it the sharpness of the winter , was making the river dark and rough , and making the puddles on the lawns and streets like little rippling seas . A row of muddy buggies was tied before the West India Store ; smoke curled from the chimney of the old distillery on the river street , and smoke was coming from the engine house of the new granite cotton mills . There was a humming from the mills , a new and restive sound . Old Mr. Nevins , who was preacher at the old First Church , was walking toward the main street . His long white hair made him very venerable ; his thoughts were so far away that he walked through the puddles , splashing as though he did not see them . " Where have you been , Richard Swale ? " Mr. Nevins asked . When Richard told him that he had been to Little Guinea , Mr. Nevins laid a hand upon his shoulder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the best of all . " The frost was oozing from the main street , leaving it all mud and ruts ; steam from wet shingles was curl-P203ing from the old First Church . A carriage had drawn up before the tavern ; a single man , a stranger , was standing on the porch , and a group of men were gathered on the sidewalk ten yards or so away . The strange thing was that Richard could hear their voices a long way off . " There 's trouble , " said Mr. Nevins . " I do believe there 's trouble . " The men on the sidewalk were staring at the tavern and their voices rose and fell with a curious intensity . A man in a tall beaver hat was speaking to them and Richard knew him well enough . It was Mr. William Scarlet , who owned the rigging lofts farther down the street  --  a heavy man , like all the Scarlet family , wearing a greatcoat buttoned to his throat . As Mr. Scarlet spoke , he would wipe his face with a red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out again . " William , " said Mr. Nevins , " what 's the matter ? " They all turned when they saw Mr. Nevins , as if they were glad to see him . " There 's matter enough , " Mr. Scarlet said . " A slave catcher 's come to town . " " Yes , " said one of the shipyard men , " and he 'd be a damned sight wiser if he was to get out again . " " Quiet , " said Mr. Nevins . " Speak more gently , friend . " He turned to Mr. Scarlet and a look passed between them . When that look passed between them , both their faces changed . " William , " said Mr. Nevins , " is there  --  " and his sentence ended with another glance .   " Yes , " said Mr. Scarlet . " Yes , a new colored man 's in town . You know where . And look on the porch ; there 's the one who 's after him , him in the black slouch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street . " As Mr. Nevins glanced toward the porch , you might have thought that the excitement pleased the stranger . His face beneath his whiskers and his drooping brown moustache was thin and yellowish . His eyes were yellowand unblinking and his voice was very smooth . He took a long cheroot from his mouth and spat at a knothole . " Wherefor 's all the noise ? " he asked . " It 's what I tell you . I 'm here to get a nigger , a low , no-account nigger . Holler , if you like . I 'll get him . " " Nigger catcher ! " some one shouted . " White trash , " said the stranger , " shut yore face ! " Mr. Nevins drew a key from the pocket of his coat . It was the key to the old First Church . " It 's time , " said Mr. Nevins . " Open up the door and toll the bell . " Then Mr. Scarlet made a sudden gesture and looked narrowly up the street . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm , " said Nevins . " I 'll speak to Matthew Swale . " Then Richard saw his father walking toward the tavern ; his head was stiff and unbending , supported by his great white collar . His gray beaver hat was freshly brushed and smooth ; the pin in his cravat , his watchchain and the top of his walking stick all glittered in the sun . The mechanics touched their hats and Mr.P205Scarlet looked ill at ease and mopped his forehead with his handkerchief . " Good morning , Matthew , " said Mr. Nevins . Matthew Swale bowed , but before he answered , the bell began to ring . " What 's wrong ? " he said . " Has some one died ? " " No , " said Mr. Nevins . " Since you ask , it 's a call . The time has come . " Mr. Nevins ' voice rose higher . The sound of the bell went pulsing through the blue like heartbeats , stirring all the sleep and all the peace of Haven 's End . " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 've known you and I 've known your father for fifty years . You wo n't see injustice done . There are officers here , looking for a poor black slave , and the bell is ringing for a signal . " " A signal ? " Matthew Swale said . " Do you mean to start a riot ? " A crowd was gathering in the street . A minute before the place had been empty , and now , before one noticed , it was filled until it seemed that all the town was there , shouting questions and elbowing toward the tavern steps . " Parson , " said Matthew Swale , " do you know what you 're doing ? " " Yes , " said Mr. Nevins , " and you 'll be with us , Matthew . " " No , I wo n't , " said Matthew Swale . " There 's one honest man in town . Who 's that on the porch ? " He was pointing to the stranger in the black felt hat . Mr. Scarlet stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Swale , " said Mr. Scarlet , " you leave himP206to us . Hey , " Mr. Scarlet 's voice rose to a shout , " do you see him , boys ? There 's a slave catcher in town ! " " Git him ! " some one shouted . " Ride him on a rail . " Then Matthew Swale 's voice also rose , harsh and clear above the ringing of the bell . " Stop that howling , " he shouted . " Do n't you know the law ? " Next there was a silence , and every one was staring . " Look ! " Richard heard some one mutter . " Yonder 's Matthew Swale . " " Do n't he lay it on , though ? " some one was muttering . " You might think he owned the town . " The noise of the bell was filling the air with a throb of excitement , until the air seemed full of angry waves . Matthew Swale walked up the steps , and every one was watching . " Good morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Swale , and I 'm at your service . " He glanced down at the sidewalk . " Do n't mind them , " he said . " Something like this was bound to happen , and cheap sentiment wo n't help it . " The man in the black felt hat stretched out a lanky hand . " Proud to make your acquaintance , sir , " he said , in that soft , smooth voice . " I 'm Joe Lacey , sir , from Calvert 's plantation , Mr. Calvert 's agent with full attorneypowers . I 've come to fetch a nigger back . " Mr. Swale did not appear to notice Mr. Lacey 's hand suspended indecisively between them . " Very good , " he said . " I 'll do what 's right , you understand . How do you know your man is here ? " P207Mr . Lacey spat over the porch rail . " Mister , " he said , " we traced him on from Boston . Niggers are powerful stupid ; I reckon I know , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like ? " said Matthew Swale . Mr. Lacey chewed on the end of his cheroot . " A big buck , powerful and prime , " he said . " Field hand purchased by Mr. Calvert in Mobile . Goes by the name of Malachi Cuffy , if he ai n't changed it . " Matthew Swale 's cane dropped from beneath his arm and clattered on the veranda boards . " Have you chanced to have seen him , sir ? " said Mr. Lacey . Richard 's father cleared his throat and then his words came harshly , loud enough for every one to hear . " He was at my house this morning , " Matthew answered . " He should be in Little Guinea now . " " Do n't you fret , sir , " said Mr. Lacey . " We know that . The marshal 's gone to fetch him . Heigh , now look yonder ! Here he comes . " There was a murmur in the street that was growing louder . Every one was turning , pushing , staring , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Half a dozen men were walking down the street , led by a heavy-bearded man who wore a badge upon his coat . A black man was in the center of that group and the eye clung to him , Richard always said , as though he stood alone . His shirt was in tatters ; the whites of his eyes were gleaming . The blood was running from a cut upon his temple and his hands were tied with rope . " It 's him , " shouted Mr. Lacey .   " And now , " shouted Mr. Swale , " there 's going to be trouble . Marshal , bring that man up here . " The sound in the street had risen until there was a roar . How it happened you could never tell ; first there was the knot of men walking down the street , and then the crowd was all about them in a rush of tossing hats and sticks . " Run ! " some one was shouting . " Run ! " It was old Mr. Nevins ' voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " By God ! " shouted Mr. Lacey . " He 's got away . Look there , he 's running yonder . " Sure enough , the black man was running up the street and Matthew Swale was watching . " Yes , " said Matthew Swale , " he 's got a pair of legs . " " Git the slave catcher , " the crowd was shouting . " Ride him on a rail . " " Do n't worry , " said Matthew Swale . " He 'll not run far ; they 'll take him up again . He 's tired ; he 's very tired . " " Fetch the slave catcher ! " they were shouting . " Ride him on a rail . " " I think , " said Matthew Swale , " you had better come to my house . You 'll be safer there . " He pushed his hat more firmly on his head and walked down the steps of the tavern porch . " Get back , " he said . " Get back . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why . " Shame ! " some one was shouting . " Shame on you , Mr. Swale . " At the head of the street , Matthew Swale stoppedp209to look behind him . Mr. Lacey 's breath was coming fast ; Mr. Lacey 's hands were trembling like his voice . " Damn ' em ! " he said . " Did you hear ' em ? They want to ride me on a rail . " But Matthew Swale still did not appear to hear . He was gazing at the crowd which was growing larger by the old First Church ; the mechanics were coming from the rigging lofts and the shops , and mill hands and shipwrights were walking from the river . " He 'll not run far , " said Matthew Swale . " The man was very tired and weak . " He sighed and looked at Mr. Lacey . " You can only do what you think is right in these days , " said Matthew Swale . " We all must stand by that . " " You 're a gentleman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said his father , " take Mr. Lacey to the guest room and bring him whisky . I 'm going back to town . We 'll have to find that man . " " Shame ! " some one had shouted . " Shame on you , Mr. Swale ! " But there was no shame upon him , even Richard could see that . It must have been after four when Matthew Swale got back home . Richard could remember , because the shadows were growing long , and the sunlight in the front hall was growing soft , as always in the afternoon , before the sun went down . As his father stood beside the table in the hall , taking off his coat , he seemed very tired . " Ah , " said Matthew Swale , " what are you doing here ? "  |p2I0  " I was waiting , sir , " said Richard . His father laid his cane beside his hat and looked sharply up and down the hall . " What the devil were you waiting for ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was true , he did not know . " Have they caught him , sir ? " " No , " his father said . " They saw him down at the Scarlet 's wharf and he broke clean away . Where 's that overseer ? Did you bring him back ? " " He 's in the guest room , " said Richard . " He 's got the whisky there . " " I 'll be bound he has , " said Matthew Swale . " Does your mother know he 's here ? " " No , " said Richard . " Mother 's in her room . " " Good , " his father said . " Has any one been asking for him ? " " No , " said Richard . " Nobody 's been here . " As he answered , he could imagine that his father was listening to some noise out in the street . " Well , they will be , " said Matthew Swale . " They 're coming . Come into the library . Do n't stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think . " His father was very much disturbed ; and his face was all sharp lines . Richard went back to a chair by the window and glanced out at the sodden lawn . His father was pacing quickly about the room but finally he sat before his desk and leaned his head upon his hands . " Father , " said Richard . " Be quiet , boy , " said Matthew Swale . " Be quiet , I want to think . " It was getting on toward dusk and there was not a sound except now and then a creaking noise in thep2IIfront hall and the rustling of the wind in the trees outside . There was the portrait of old Daniel Swale upon the wall ; his face seemed to sink back into the canvas but his eyes seemed brighter in the dusk . There seemed to be all sorts of people who moved about that room . You could almost imagine that all the other Swales were back in the Swale house , when the dusk was coming on , whispering of all sorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were saying , " Do n't be afraid . We 're here . " The blacks would come out in canoes to meet the ship . Richard could see them coming over violet water , through the dusk , against a coast line of dark , misty trees . He could almost hear their shouts as they came alongside the ships from Haven 's End . It did not seem strange when he looked up to see a black man there , because he seemed a part of all the shadows , an unseen thing grown real . He stood in the center of the library , as noiseless as a shadow , but he was alive ; Richard could see the gleam of his eyes and the rise and fall of his black skin beneath his torn , checked shirt . He was in a shirt and breeches , barefoot , with a blood clot on his cheek . Richard Swale remembered clutching at the arms of his chair and shutting his eyes , but when he looked again , the black man was still there , breathing noiselesslythrough his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " father . " And then his father saw him . Richard saw his father turn very slowly and saw his eyes grow wide and his face turn white as paper . Somehow some spell hadp2I2broken , when his father turned , and all the shadows vanished . Malachi Cuffy , the runaway slave , was standing in the library . As Matthew Swale moved , Malachi Cuffy moved also , and as he did so , Richard saw that he had a billet of wood in his hand . " White man , " he said softly , " white man . " Matthew Swale got up , holding the back of his chair , but he did not speak ; his face was still as white as paper , just as though he had seen a ghost . " White man , " said Malachi Cuffy , " do n't yo ' move . Yo ' done tole on me , did yo ' , white man ? " Then Matthew Swale found his voice , and it did not surprise Richard that he was not afraid . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd gone to get you before I told . How did you come here ? " As Malachi Cuffy answered , Richard could remember his white teeth shining through the dusk . " I come through the back window , " Malachi Cuffy said . " They 'll know that no one will help a poor nigger here . And white man , yo ' done told . " Richard always remembered how his father stood with his hands resting on the back of his chair and though his face was white , his voice was steady . " You 've been running a long way , " he said . " Yes , white man , " said Malachi , " I been running ; I been running . " " Put down that stick , " said Matthew Swale . " White man , " said Malachi , " do n't yo ' move . I 'll kill yo ' if yo ' move . " Matthew Swale was very quick . He must have knownp213all the while what he would do , and the chair he held was light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its upward arc landed clean on Malachi Cuffy 's jaw . There was a thud and a rattle of the chair , as the two men rolled together on the floor . Then Matthew Swale had his hands on Malachi 's throat and his knee on Malachi Cuffy 's chest . " Richard , " he was saying , " take this key and get the irons from the desk , and close the door . Do n't hurry ; there 's no need to hurry . The poor man 's weak as water . You could have knocked him down . " There was one thing besides , which his father said . Richard could remember it , though he was taken with a fit of trembling . " They work , " said Matthew Swale . " Now who would have thought they 'd work ? " Malachi Cuffy was sitting on the floor , with manacles on his wrists and ankles , and Matthew Swale was on his feet , and looking still as though he saw a ghost ; and the picture of Daniel Swale was staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although they were all alone . " This house is old , " his father said . " Lord , but it is old . Richard , fetch the brandy and wet that poor man 's lips . Take the brandy , black man ; do n't you be afraid . " Matthew Swale , himself , must have known the room was filled with other people , for he looked around him exactly as though he saw . Then Richard heard some one running down the stairs . " Mr. Swale , " some one was calling . " Mr. Swale. "  | " Here , " called Matthew Swale , " do n't shout like that . You 'll wake the dead . " Richard was the one who opened the library door , and there was Mr. Lacey , smelling strong of whisky . His hair was matted ; he was twisting his long hands together , and he did not appear to notice that anything was strange , because it was very clear that Mr. Lacey was afraid . " I seen ' em from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds coming up the street ! You wo n't let ' em take me , will you , Mr. Swale ? " " No , " said Matthew Swale . " Stay here and watch this man . " As though it was an everyday occurrence he walked into the hall and picked up his hat and cane . Even then , that experience must have been fresher in his mind than the news of the crowd upon the street , for he turned toward the library again and spoke out a thought , though there was no need to speak . " He wanted to kill me , " he said . " I 'd have done the same . " Then his voice was drowned out by the thundering of the eagle knocker on the front door . Matthew Swale opened it and walked out upon the granite steps . The first thing one felt , Richard said , was the imminence of danger that made the skin creep , and then one saw the crowd . They were filing through the gate of the high fence by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little noise . You could easily see their faces through the dusk . There must have been a hundred , enough at any rate to be beyond the grasp of ordinary thought.  |p215They  were talking in low voices , but they stopped when they saw Matthew Swale . Two men who must have knocked upon the door were standing on the gravel walk , Mr. Scarlet , mopping at his face , and Jonathan Hume , a foreman from the shipyard . Matthew Swale looked at the crowd and then at Mr. Scarlet and then at Jonathan Hume , seemingly getting it all in his mind as one might memorize a row of figures . " Well ? " he said . " Well ? " Mr. Scarlet mopped his face again , and Jonathan Hume thrust his hands in his jacket pockets . " Do n't you want to know what we 're here for ? " he inquired . " No , " said Matthew Swale , " but I 'll tell you this . I 'll give you two minutes to get off of my front lawn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It do n't do any good to talk like that , " he said . " Scarlet and me here , we 're heading the Vigilance Committee . " " Now , Mr. Swale , " said Mr. Scarlet , " we do n't want to make any trouble for you . " " You wo n't , " said Matthew Swale , and smiled . " When a pair like you heads anything . " Mr. Scarlet 's voice was thick . " I guess we 're just as good as you . " " Ah , " said Matthew , " did you come here to tell me that ? " " We came here to get that damn slave catcher . That 's why we 've come . Will you give him up or must we bust in to get him ? " It was clear that Matthew was growing angry , though he did not raise his voice . " So , it 's a mob , is it ? " he said.  | " A tar-and-feather mob . Get off with it , Mr. Hume . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're asked . " " Do n't you put on any airs now , " Mr. Scarlet said . " We 're just as good as you  --  you nigger catcher . " " Nigger catcher , " shouted some one . " That 's what Swale is , boys ! " Richard never dreamed what would happen next ; even when it had happened , the action seemed incredible . Matthew Swale had raised his cane and had struck Mr. Scarlet diagonally across the face . Mr. Scarletstaggered a step backwards ; involuntarily his hands went up . " There , " said Matthew Swale , " that 'll do for you . " Suddenly his voice rose to a shout . " Listen , you , " he shouted . " Hold your tongues and listen . The man in my house is acting according to the law . Do you understand what that means ? He 's in my house and he 'll stay in my house as long as I 'm in it . Now move off of my front lawn . " Then some one threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the air was filled with stones and the noise was suddenly terrible , indistinguishable , derisive , jeering . Every one upon the lawn was sneering at Matthew Swale . " Come on , " Mr. Hume was shouting . " Come and git him , boys . " And they were coming , swarming up the thirty yards of lawn . Richard could see them , black faces and white faces , crouching bodies , and awkward , shambling feet . " Richard , " Matthew Swale was saying , " go inside and lock the door . "  |p217The  time was too short for accurate impression , but it could not have been more than a few seconds after his father raised his cane when Richard was aware that his mother was on the doorstep . She had come there as illogically as a figure in a vision , but the sight of her was very clear , her white hooped skirt with little flowers printed on it , her shawl with the cameo pin . " Matthew , " she was saying , " what is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and very sweet , and next instant she lay on the doorstep in a rumple of white muslin , broken and without a word . And next , his father was kneeling over her , holding up her head . Somehow everything had stopped and there was only his father 's voice , breaking with a sob . " You cowards ! " he shouted . He was lifting her in his arms ; his back was to the lawn as he carried her through the doorway . Richard followed him , but when he turned and looked , just before he closed the door , there was no one on the lawn . Every one had gone ; they must have started leaving when they saw her fall . Richard remembered when she opened her eyes , though he could not tell how much time had elapsed . She was lying on her four-posted bed , covered with a Paisley shawl . There was a decanter of brandy upon the candle stand , and old Nora , the children 's nurse , was laying a hot towel on her head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter ? I should drink that brandy , if I were you . " Richard had never seen his father so . He was nearly ashamed or afraid to look long at his father 's face ; he could not tell which . Matthew Swale had been kneelingp218by the bed , but when she spoke , he got up slowly and drank the glass of brandy very quickly and then he wiped his eyes . " When I find the man who did this  --  " he began , but he stopped when she smiled at him , softly , mockingly , for she was never afraid of Matthew Swale . " It 's just as well I was there , " she said . " You could n't have stopped them . Could you , Matthew ? Matthew did not reply . The old lines were returning to his mouth and eyes , but he must have known that never in the world could he have stopped them . " It 's what I said , " she was still speaking . " None of them know that you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , because he himself had the same feelings ; yet perhaps his father never knew exactly what he said . " You ca n't help what 's inside you , " said Matthew Swale . " I have to do what I think is right . Do n't you understand ? I have to do what I think is right . " She sighed and turned her head . " I know , " she said . " Please do n't lecture , Matthew . The Swales always do what they think is right . It makes no difference , if one is kind . " " You 'd best be leaving now , sir , " Nora said . " You and the young master . The lady 's very tired . " Matthew Swale walked down the stairs very slowly . You could not tell what he was thinking , because the lines were back upon his face . The lamp in the hall was lighted and its yellow light went up and up into the blackness of the landings , making his shadow grotesquely long against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , " said Matthew Swale , and he opened the library door . There they were , just as he had left them . The black man was crouching on the floor , with his face buried in his hands , as Mr. Lacey sat watching him , smoking one of his cheroots . The air was very thick with the cigar smoke , thick enough to make you cough . " The marshal 's coming in a carriage , " said Matthew Swale , " to take you out of town . " " Well and good , sir , " said Mr. Lacey . " It ca n't be too quick for me , and once I get this black boy back  --  " And Mr. Lacey began to swear . Matthew Swale crossed the room toward Malachi and slapped him on the back . " Stand up , " he said . " I want to have a look at you . " " Yes , sah , " said Malachi . " Yes , sah . " " And how do you feel about it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back ? " Malachi looked at Mr. Lacey and looked away . " Yes , sah , " he said . " Ah , " said Mr. Lacey . " He 'd kill me if he could , the black  --  " And Mr. Lacey began to swear again . Matthew Swale placed his hands behind him and looked at Malachi and cleared his throat . " I stand for law and order , do you understand ? " he said . " I reckon , " said Mr. Lacey , " when I get back , I 'll tell ' em there are gentlemen in the North . " " Lacey , " said Matthew Swale , " I stand for doing what 's right , but I 've never seen a black man chased before . "  | " You ai n't a planter , sir , " said Mr. Lacey , and . he laughed . " But you know niggers , that 's what I 've been saying : These are gentle people , and they know niggers , and they 've got the fixings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swale , " we know them , and this one looks like a good strong hand . " " Ah , " said Mr. Lacey , " he 'll be prime when he gets the cussedness beat out of him . Yes , sir . " " Do you want to sell him ? " said Matthew Swale . Mr. Lacey started and took his cheroot from his mouth . " No , " said Mr. Lacey , " I ai n't his owner , sir . " " No , " said Matthew Swale . " But you have attorney powers . You have them in your pocket and fifteen hundreddollars is the top price of field hands now . " " Well , " said Mr. Lacey , " I do n't aim to sell . I did n't come on to sell no niggers . " " Very good , " said Matthew Swale . " You , Malachi , hold out your hands . Mr. Lacey , you do n't own these chains . My grandfather owned these . " " Here , now , " cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Matthew Swale began to smile . " I said , " he repeated , " that you do n't own the chains . He 's yours . Take him , if you want him . Richard , let us step outside . " " Here , now , " cried Mr. Lacey . " That ai n't right . " Matthew Swale stepped toward him . " Do n't tellme what 's right or wrong . There he is ; now take him . " " Here , now , " cried Mr. Lacey , " do n't go out . Don'tleave me with that nigger here . " " Perhaps , " said Matthew Swale , " you 'd rather sell ? "  |p22I  " Yes , " said Mr. Lacey . " Yes , I 'll sell . " " That 's better , " said Matthew Swale . " Richard , light the candle on my desk while I draw my check . Malachi , come over here . You 're my nigger now . "  |p225NEARLY  EVERY ONE IN HAVEN 'S END could tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dennis Swale himself would be the one to tell it best , you 'd think , until you tried to ask him . Dennis had that tight mouth of all the portraits in the old Swale house . Nothing could shake a word from Dennis Swale on such an affair as that , because the Swales were proud . Yet he must have known that everybody knew , because the story was too good to be forgotten . It had the harshness and the narrowness of a port which had lost its shipping . Though Haven 's End was growing very small and bare by then , the old currents still were running . The landmarks still exist , though it happened nearly forty years ago . The Swale mills were in it , and the granite buildings of the mills are by the river . The engines in the power house were made in ' 72 , when old Matthew Swale knew that shipping was finished ;  |p226and  not a spindle has turned for fifteen years , but they were moving , back in ' 93 . And the Deene place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its overgrown shrubbery , farther up the river , devoid of a graceful line , for there was no beauty in Haven 's End back in ' 93 . And the Penny Savings Bank was in it , a brownstonefacade among the old brick buildings on the street . You may have seen Dennis Swale , a pompous , dull , stout gentleman , walking in the evening past the stores down by the river , a long-nosed little man with a tight-shut mouth . The crowd in front of the ShoeShineParlor would stop its talk . Their voices would drop to a murmur involuntary and low , but if Dennis noticed , he never gave a sign . " Good evening , Mr. Swale , " some one would say , and Dennis would give a gracious nod , while every one stared after him , as he walked quickly by . Then there would be a silence , half constrained , as though every one had met with something odd and out of place . " Say , " some one would say , " he 's getting older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting older . Do n't he look old-fashioned , though ? Say , do you remember  --  " Something preposterous in his manner , which took for granted an unmerited superiority , gave him that archaic air . When Dennis ran for mayor against John Scarlet in the fall of ' 92 , you have the beginning of it , as much as anything in our town can begin , where the Colonial era kept rising from its grave . You can imagineDennis Swale speaking in his thin , harsh voice top227a sea of strangers who had never known a Swale . You can imagine the brass bands and the torches weaving down the street and what the mill hands said . Dennis had no sympathy for mill hands and they had none for him . You can imagine what John Scarlet said , waving his arms , shouting through the autumn night . Dennis Swale could never gain that common touch , which the Scarlets could not lose . John Scarlet ran a shoe shop after he sold the tavern and he could handle men . You could imagine him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fist , lost upon the sea of his own eloquence . His speech is still in the files of the old Gazette , ringing with a bitterness rising from the solid type . " Friends ,  --  I call you friends , because you know me and I know you . I know what you think and I know what you want . Does Mr. Swale know that ? No , friends , he do n't know anything and what 's more , he do n't care . " But he 's Mr. Swale , ' you say . Of course , Mr. Swale would never think of us . ' Now , who are the Swales ? Do n't be frightened ; I can tell you . There 's been a Scarlet in this town as long as there 's been a Swale . Who are they and what ? I ca n't think what  --  they 've lived so long on dead men 's money . They 've lived here on other people 's work , and the work of folks like you and me . And what have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is Mr. Swale here now ? I 'm not afraid to say it to his face . He 's nothing but a name . " Dennis was in the directors ' room in the Penny Bankp228when the last returns came . The gaslights flickered against the black-walnut woodwork and in the street outside a band was playing very badly . Mr. Deene was there , of course , being president of the bank in those days . He kept looking out the window at the torchlights ; he kept tapping on the sill and whistling through his teeth . " Dennis , " said Mr. Deene , " you ca n't compete with Scarlet . You ca n't swim against the tide . " Dennis sat in his chair , motionless and stony-faced . " It 's Scarlet 's fault , " he said , " that blackleg 's made them vote me down . " Then he rose with sharp , deep lines about his mouth . " Do you hear them yell ? " he said . " That 's Scarlet . I 'm not finished with Scarlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that same bland look ; the story goes that Alfred Deene was a handsome man , heavy and broad-shouldered , with dark , deep eyes and a high white forehead . Alfred Deene had the golden touch and he knew life as well as he knew money . Outside in the street there was a burst of cheering ; the noise made Dennis start . " There , " said some one , " there goes Scarlet now . " The gaslight flickered against the dark woodwork and flickered against the face of Alfred Deene , and one can imagine how he spoke when Dennis Swale was gone  --  with half-concealed amusement and halfconcealedcontempt . " Can you believe it ? " said Alfred Deene . " He thinks he 's living in the eighteenth century . He thinks he can hurt Scarlet . Can you imagine that ? " Then Adam Munn spoke up . He always said hep229never liked the smartness of Alfred Deene . He seemed to be speaking for a lost cause , for politeness , or for something that was leaving Haven 's End . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , I do n't know . There 's something in them Swales . " Though Alfred Deene did not answer , one could imagine what he was thinking behind his deep , still eyes . Alfred Deene could juggle figures and he could juggle facts ; he must have been thinking , even then , how he could juggle Dennis Swale . " Yes , " he said , " Scarlet 's made him mad and when a man 's mad he 's a fool . I do n't get mad ever . " There is silence now in the Penny Bank , except for the money talking ; the sound of the money rings behind the counters , hollow and secure , above the pains of life and death . The adding machines click with a sharp , staccato note , like machine guns in a front-line trench , followed by the rustling of treasury paper and the rippling of the silver , but all the rest was silence . Nevertheless , until a little while ago , Adam Munn used to sit behind the counter , working at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been there for a long time . He had grown thin and light and noiseless , like a genius of the place , and his voice would echo from the black-walnut carvings of the directors ' room , so that it sounded like the rustling of a sheaf of bonds . Mr. Munn would twist his eye-shade back and straighten his alpaca coat and stare at the photographs of the presidents on the wall , all hardfaced , whiskered men of an older generation , but all with a common stamp , like the members of a family . Adam Munn could pick their voices from his memoryp230as one picked music on a banjo 's strings . He could imitatetheir footsteps and their gestures with a mimicry more like an actor 's than a clerk 's , if the directors ' room was silent and the bank 's front door was closed . " Yes , " he would say , " in the big gold frame  --  there 's Denny Swale . It do n't seem so long that he was younger . Matters do n't move much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , is how it seems to me . " And he was right . Haven 's End was very slow . " Yes , " Adam Munn would say , " you can tell him from his nose . The Swales have always had long noses , as I 've heard tell  --  comical , like this  --  but he was n't president then , only a director , serving without pay . Alfred Deene was president back in ' 93 . No , his picture is n't on the wall . The slower the place , the quicker the time . It do n't seem so long ago that Mr. Deene left town  --  " And Adam Munn 's voice would go quavering and keen , turning the old secrets up which were a part of other secrets which one could feel but never know . " He walked right in here , " Adam Munn would say . " He was n't fat the way he is now , Mr. Dennis was n't , and you could n't tell what he was thinking , no more than you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly , like he owned the place  --  you know how the Swales do  --  and he sat down  --  like this  --  right where you 're sitting now , with his hat still on his head . And then he looked around the room , squinting up his eyes . " It was curious  --  when Adam Munn went on , he could make the whole scene real , because he had the actor 's gift . A sudden grimace , a quick turn of his wrist ,  |p231and  Adam Munn was Dennis Swale , and the directors ' room was filled with a new , tense stillness . " ' Give me a sheet of paper and a pen , ' was what he said , and now go fetch the gluepot , and paste that on the door . ' " And that was all that Dennis said . He was like all the Swales , without a sense of drama but with a code of manners , or an instinct , if you care to call it that . Adam Munn could remember the morning when Alfred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he piece it all together , even to imagining what both those men were thinking , so that all their words seemed finally like draughts on a checker-board , moving with a purpose , but meaningless , like most words , until hidden thought was clear . It was the year of the panic in 1893 , when the nation was tossing in its economic throes and when banks were falling down like ninepins . The noise of it reached even to Haven 's End in those days , carrying an uncertainty upon the air , which was very close to dread . It was a stormy morning , Adam Munn remembered , and the east wind was blowing hard , driving a cold gray rain , hissing upon the windowpanes of the office in the Swale mill . The hissing of the rain and the moaningof that wind were mingled with the humming of the cotton spindles , which made a sound so constant that it was like a background to all living . The private office was vibrant with that sound , even on that windy morning . Through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river , slate-gray and wintry , because the spring was coming late . Beside the river , like wreckage almost ,  |p232was  the lost endeavor of Haven 's End . The last of the wharves , right below the window , had degenerated to a coal pocket , and the rain could never wholly wash the soot from the sagging buildings around it . The roof and chimney of the old rum distillery , which had been closed ten years before , thrust themselves out of that blackness in sullen disrepair , and the gray piling and the rusting machinery of the disused shipyard were like a patch of forest blackened by some fire . The granite foundations of the Swale mills seemed to be standing on that wreckage , like a last endeavor of the town to cope with change , and even the Swale mills were growing old and dark . Adam was making entries in the private account books , standing in his shirt sleeves in front of the tall clerk 's desk , when Mr. Dennis called him . Adam could write with a beautiful hand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His figures and his letters had fishtails and shadings like a copperplate engraving ; but his pen shook when Mr. Dennis called . " Did you hear me , Munn ? " said Dennis Swale . " Just a minute , sir , " said Adam . " I made a blot upon the page . " Mr. Swale looked up quickly from his roll-top desk and straightened the purple folds of his cravat . " That 's the second time this week you 've blotted those accounts , " Mr. Dennis said . " I 'm sorry , sir , " said Adam . " It does no good to be sorry , " said Dennis Swale . " You 're lucky to be earning ten dollars a week . Comep233here and write down this notice . I want it pasted on the doors . " Adam Munn was angry . There was something steely and meager in Dennis Swale which was enough to stir one 's anger . " Ten dollars is n't much , " said Adam Munn . " It 's enough for these times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen men like you . " " No wonder every one leaves town , " said Adam Munn . " You 're the sort who makes ' em . " For a moment he could almost think that Dennis Swale was surprised at that . He looked at Adam Munn and then out of the window toward the river , which was flat and empty beneath the rain . " This place is good enough , " said Dennis Swale . " Leave it if you want to go away . " Mr. Dennis was looking at him and he was not angry . " But you wo n't , " he said . " I want you to bring the books to the house to-night at half-past seven o'clock . Now write down this notice . Are you ready ? " Dennis Swale cleared his throat ; he seemed to be listening to the humming of the mill . " Owing to uncertainbusiness conditions , " he said , " this mill will be closed , beginning to-morrow , March 10th , until further notice . Signed , Dennis Swale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors . " He turned away as though he had dictated an ordinary letter , but Adam Munn was startled . " Are things as bad as that ? " he asked . " Yes , " said Mr. Swale . " Copy out these notices . The wind 's freshening ; we 're going to have more rain . "  |p234It  must have been almost at that minute that Mr. Deene came in , and it was good to see him . Mr. Deene was always rich and easy ; he came in smoking a long cigar and smiling at Mr. Swale , but even when he smiled , his glance was steady and his face was a poker face . In spite of his frankness , you had a baffled feeling always ; you could not tell what was going on behind his eyes . He slapped his hat on the table by the letter press , sat down and twisted his heavy watch chain around his fingers . " Have you seen the wires from New York ? " he said . Mr. Dennis leaned back in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , " he said , " I 'm glad I 'm not playing the market . Deene , are you all right ? " " Yes , " said Mr. Deene , " yes , I 'm all right . Look at me . Do I look worried ? " " No , " said Dennis Swale , " nothing ever worries you . I wonder how you do it , Deene . Nothing ever worries you . What do you want ? I 'm busy . " Alfred Deene began to laugh and flipped the ash from his cigar . " How do you know I want anything ? " Then Adam Munn remembered a look that passed between them , a wordless , watchful look , as though they both were thinking of something which they did not say . " Because you 're always wanting something , " Mr. Dennis said . " You 're the kind who never goes anywhere unless there 's something he wants . " Mr. Deene laughed again , but his eyes were veryp235blank and there was something happening which Adam did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twinge of dread and a suspicion of Mr. Deene ; he was watching every move which Mr. Dennis made , as he sat there smoking his cigar . All at once , Adam Munn could tell that Mr. Deene was sharp , with a sharpness that Mr. Dennis would never match . " Dennis , " he said , " you 're sharp , I always said you were sharp . So you 're going to close your mill ? " " Who told you that ? " There was a pause for a moment ; there was not a sound except the hissing of the rain upon the window . " Scarlet , " said Alfred Deene . " Scarlet told me that . " There was a sharp creak from Mr. Dennis ' chair . " He did , did he ? " Mr. Dennis said . Mr. Deene was watching all the while , behind his blank , clear eyes . " Yes , " he said ; and Scarlet said , It is n't right . You ought to think about your help , ' he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should I think of them ? " he asked . " They 've never thought of me . " " Swale , " said Mr. Deene very softly , " are you still angry , Swale ? " " Yes , " said Mr. Dennis . " He 's the one who made them hate me . Yes , I wo n't forget . " " No , " said Mr. Deene , " I thought you would n't . " He smiled and leaned forward , so that his voice was very low . " I 've got two notes on Scarlet 's shoe shop . They 're falling due to-morrow and I 'll sell ' em to you cheap . I wo n't take ' em up again . There is n't a bank in the State that will take ' em up to-morrow . " Mr. Dennis ' voice was steady but he was leaning forward too.  | " Due to-morrow , eh ? " said Mr. Dennis . " Yes , " he said , " and I wo n't take them up . Did you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're drawing out deposits . There 's a line of women on the sidewalk , waiting in the rain . I wo n't renew . " Mr. Deene leaned farther forward . " He ca n't meet them , Swale . " Dennis Swale was not pleasant to look at , though his expression had not changed . Suddenly all the narrow harshness of our town was written on his face , a fanatical , unreasoning harshness . Adam Munn stood staring over his account book ; he did not dare to move , because he knew that he was watching something that he was not meant to see . " What do you want beside the cash ? " said Dennis Swale . " Put your cards on the table . Do n't keep them up your sleeve . You want something , Deene . " Mr. Deene sat motionless , watching Dennis Swale . " Listen , " he said . " The bank 's all right , as right as rain . " And as he spoke , the rain went swish against the window . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is n't our kind , Swale , and you 're a director in the Penny Bank . " " Yes , " said Mr. Dennis , " a Swale 's been a director since 1849 . " Then , suddenly , they both looked up , startled , though Adam Munn could have sworn he had not made a sound . Suddenly their eyes were on Adam , Mr. Dennis ' startled , Mr. Deene 's bland and opaque . " Munn , " said Mr. Dennis , " go out and wait in the other room . " Then Adam Munn was standing in the outer officep237by the door , and all at once he noticed that his forehead was very moist . Though the door was a blank pine panel , he still could see Dennis Swale and the face of Mr. Deene , and he still could see Mr. Deene 's forefinger twisting at his watch chain . There he was in the private office , twisting Dennis Swale around his finger . And Mr. Dennis never knew . " Munn . " It was Mr. Dennis calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There they were by Mr. Dennis ' desk , seated side by side . Mr. Dennis was looking at a paper lined with figures ; he folded it , as Adam Munn came in , and passed it back to Mr. Deene . " Munn , " he said , " take this down . Are you ready ?  --  As a director of the Penny Bank , I have examined the figures , and to the best of my belief , the bank is sound .  --  All right , bring it here . I 'll sign it . " Mr. Deene rose slowly from his chair and took his hat . " Thanks , " he said . " I wo n't forget this , Swale . " And probably he never did . Adam Munn could always remember him standing in his newly pressed clothes , tall and handsome , looking down at Dennis Swale , smiling . Though one could not read his thought , Alfred Deene must have been laughing inside himself , laughing at his own despair , in his knowledge that he was fighting grimly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one more day of grace . " Good-by , Dennis , " said Alfred Deene . " They may not like you , but they know you tell the truth . " Dennis Swale looked up at Adam Munn , but he could not meet his eyes ; it was conscience , Adam knew.  | " Keep this to yourself , " said Dennis Swale . " Yes , " said Adam Munn , " I 'm not a talker . " " No , " said Mr. Dennis , " you 're not a talker . Whatthe devil are you waiting for ? " " Mr. Swale , sir , " Adam cleared his throat , surprised at his own voice . " You had n't ought to have signed that , Mr. Swale . " " Signed what ? " said Mr. Dennis . " What the devil do you mean ? " " Mr. Swale , " said Adam Munn , and he forgot to be afraid of Dennis Swale , " do n't you see he was fooling you ? You should n't have signed that about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deene is . Twice as slick as you . He  --  he 's fooled you somehow , Mr. Swale . " " Stop your talk ! " said Mr. Dennis . " Get back there to your books . " And Mr. Dennis turned , looking through the window across the street , and Adam Munn knew what he was watching ; he was looking at Scarlet 's shoe shop , dripping in the rain . Tom Low had come in from the outer office ; he was shifting nervously from one foot to the other , because , in spite of all his talk , he was afraid of Dennis Swale . " Well , what is it ? " Mr. Dennis said . " Mr. Scarlet 's out here , sir . " Tom swallowed in his nervousness , as Mr. Dennis stared at him . " Mr. John Scarlet from the shoe shop . He wants to see you right away . " " Scarlet , " said Mr. Dennis , " Scarlet ? The town is full of Scarlets . Why do n't you show him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solid , red-faced man with bushy hair , and he looked embarrassed , likep239the clerk almost , when he stood in the center of the office . " Hullo , Scarlet , " said Mr. Dennis , " what 's the matter now ? " " Mr. Swale , " said Mr. Scarlet , " I sort of thought I 'd come in here , Mr. Swale , because there has always been Swales and Scarlets in this town , and we 've got to do what 's fair . " " Yes , " said Mr. Dennis , " yes , of course . " Now Adam did not know what to think when he saw them standing there . There was a significance about it , without relation to the time and place , as John Scarlet must have known , when he said that there had always been a Scarlet and a Swale . You had a feeling , Adam said , that they could not help what they said next . They were like the figures in his ledger in black ink and in red , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ink , always truthful , yet in a contradiction which never struck a balance . Somehow , as Adam saw them , his mind went back to endless pages of red and black and black and red , mingling with all the days and nights which had passed over Haven 's End . " Now it 's this way , " Mr. Scarlet said . Mr. Scarlet was a good man and not afraid to speak his mind . " I see you 're going to close the mill . Could n't you carry it for a week or so ? I 'm keeping the shoe shop going , running at a loss . " Mr. Dennis seemed surprised ; he looked at John Scarlet with an added interest . " And why , are you doing that ? " he asked . " Look here . " Mr. Scarlet also seemed surprised . " Are n't you worried about your help ? "  | " My help ? " said Mr. Dennis . " What about the help ? " " What are they going to do ? That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . " Mr. Dennis was always dull . " I 've made plans , in case there 's trouble . " Mr. Scarlet drew out his handkerchief and wiped his forehead , and for a moment he seemed at a loss for anything to answer . " Say , " said Mr. Scarlet , " listen . You do n't grasp what I 'm trying to say . You 've got to think about these people , have n't you ? They 're human , like you and me . You 're responsible for these  --  these fellers , Mr. Swale . It ai n't right , now is it , to throw ' em out without a bit of notice ? " A flash of light came over Mr. Dennis ; Adam could see it come . " Look here . " Suddenly Mr. Dennis ' face was a cold , light pink . " Are you coming here , telling me what to do ? Are you telling me what 's right or wrong ? Is that it ? This is my mill , Scarlet , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you attend to yours . " " Now here , now , " said Mr. Scarlet , in a louder tone . " That ai n't no way to talk , Swale . You get off your high horse , Swale . I 've come here the way any decent party would , to talk things over . It ai n't right  --  that 's all . " Mr. Dennis rose from his swivel chair , and Adam hurried from behind his desk , because Mr. Dennis had an ugly look . " Confound your impertinence , " Mr. Dennis said . " Do you think I care a continental what people like you think ? " " No , " said Mr. Scarlet . " That 's right , you do n't ;  |p241but  I guess I 'm just as good as you . You do n't care if men are dying starving , so long as you 're all right ; and every one knows that . You 're a hard man , like your father . The whole tribe of you is hard , but you keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skunk . You 're a skinflint , for all your airs , and I 'll say it to your face . " There was a silence broken by the humming of the mill and by the splashing of the rain . Mr. Dennis drew a deep , sharp breath and touched his purple cravat softly with his finger tips , and Adam knew if Mr. Scarlet tried a hundred years , he could not look like Dennis Swale . He was beyond the anger of Mr. Scarlet 's voice , in some land of his own . A thousand men with sweatingbrows , a century of shadows had built that land . " Scarlet , " said Mr. Swale , " listen to me , Scarlet . " Adam Munn set down his pen because his hand was shaking . Mr. Dennis ' fingers were moving over his purple cravat and he had begun to smile . It was almost like a play , the end of which Adam knew already . " You 've made me into  --  what did you say ?  --  a skunk . You 've interpreted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongue . Yes , you 've got a nasty tongue , and I 've sat here and taken your lashing . Did you think I was always going to take it ? Were you such a fool as that ? You 've been meddling with my affairs . I 'll meddle with yours now . I bought your notes from Mr. Deene this morning . They 're due to-morrow noon . " Mr. Scarlet passed his hand across his forehead . " He sold me , did he ? Deene did that ? " " Yes , " said Mr. Swale , " Deene did that . Can youp243fist , Scarlet . There 's been scene enough . Munn , show Mr. Scarlet out . He 'll be leaving now . " For a moment , Mr. Scarlet stared at him openmouthed , without an answer . He seemed bewildered , bereft of anything to answer . " Here now ! " cried Mr. Scarlet . " Do n't tell me you do n't know ! " " Munn , " said Mr. Swale , " show Mr. Scarlet out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back . He was standing , staring at the worn pine floor , his lips as tight as though they had been sewed together , breathing through his long , thin nose . 1 le could not keep his hands still ; his fingers were clenching and unclenching , long , graceful fingers like the hands of all the Swales . " Damn his insolence ! " said Mr. Dennis . " I should have horsewhipped that man . Post those notices on the door and bring the books at half-past seven to-night . Munn , I am going home . " Then Adam Munn was running after him . " Mr. Swale , " he was calling , " you 've forgotten your coat and hat . It 's raining , Mr. Swale . " There was no doubt that it was raining ; the wind had shifted to the northeast and the streets were runningwater , but Dennis Swale did not answer ; he was walking through the mill yards , past the picket gates , with a quick , nervous stride , bare-headed in the rain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once the wind shifted to the northeast and the rain was coming down ; even now , on a stormy , blowy day , one still has that sensation  --  that our town stands aloof and small , beyond the aid of all the land behind it.  |p242raise  ten thousand dollars by to-morrow morning , Scarlet ? Think ! Think hard ! Will you keep your shop going and owe me ten thousand dollars ? Think hard , Scarlet . " " Ah , " said Mr. Scarlet , " you 're laughing at me , are you ? " " Yes , " said Mr. Swale , " I 'm laughing at you and everybody like you . You 've laughed at me long enough . But why discuss it , Scarlet ? You would n't understand . " " Do n't I ? " said Mr. Scarlet . " I understand , all right . I understand the way you got them notes , because you wrote a piece saying the bank was sound . Deceiving people when a bank is going busted ! All for personal spite ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I thank the Lord that made me that I 'm not like you . If I 've said anything about you , I 've said it right , and I 'll say it again about a man who knows a bank is going busted . " " Just a minute , " said Dennis Swale . " What bank ? " " The Penny Savings Bank ! " roared Mr. Scarlet , " And everybody knows it , the same as you ! " Dennis Swale sat down again and shrugged his shoulders . " Scarlet , " he said , and his voice was almost pleasant , " I suppose it takes all sorts to make a world . You and I are different sorts . I regret that there are more of you than me . I do n't like you , nor you me , and there 's no reason that you should . I 've never liked you , nor what you stand for . I do n't like demagogues . Did you ever hear the word ? That 's what you are . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marble wall , and you belong in mud  --  but I never knew until now you were a liar . Do n't double up yourp244Haven 's End was small and drab and weary when the rain was coming down ; the mist of the rains cut off the hills behind the river and the marshes and the mud flats , leaving only the streets and the houses entirely alone . There was a railroad in those days and a telegraph and even several telephones , but none of these made a difference in the northeast wind ; the houses were small and sodden in their dampness , and the streets seemed narrower , and a futility was over everything as the rain came down in sheets . Adam Munn could feel the sadness because the town was going down ; all about the mills the streets were lined with slack , small houses , crowding against larger dwellings , which were falling to decay . The streets were filled with strange voices , speaking in foreign tongues . The tide of emigration had left swarthy faces , rising like the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Munn hated the sight of them , regarding them with sharp distrust , as every one did who was sprung from native stock . " Look at ' em , " said Adam Munn . " They 're reading the signs on the door . " The mill yard was filled with men and women , standing in the rain ; they were talking in a babel of voices , wholly meaningless , raised in volatile excitement . " Look at ' em jabbering like a lot of monkeys , " muttered Adam Munn . There was a shuffling and stamping in the outer office and a pounding on the door . When Adam Munn opened it , Michael Towhig , the foreman of the lower spinning room , was standing on the threshold , and behind him were half a dozen men in overalls andp245ragged shirts , whitened by the cotton dust . They stared at the office , inarticulate and bereft of speech , all except Michael Towhig , who cleared his throat and wiped his hands on the side of his breeches . " Where 's the boss ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Swale ? " " Sure , " said Michael Towhig , " sure , I 'm after meaning Swale . Is he gone ? Ai n't he the dirty sneak ? What we want to know is , is it true the mill is clos-ing ? " " That 's no way to talk , " said Adam . " It 's Mr. Swale 's mill ; he can do what he wants with it . You saw the signs  --  of course the mill is closing . " " Ah , " said Michael Towhig , " and so he run away , did he , without looking us in the face ? How do we cat without work ? Suppose you tell me that . " " Boys , " said Adam Munn , " I ca n't tell you that , and do n't you yell at me , Mike . I 'm not Mr. Swale . I do n't own the mill . " " Ah , " said Michael Towhig , " ai n't he the dirty sneak ? Is n't he up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with his pair of horses and his nigger to drive him , living on dead men 's money , so he is ? He did n't build this mill , did he ? " " Oh , shut up ! " said Adam Munn . " What 's the use in yelling ? Times are bad , and I guess they 're bad for rich men too . Work somewhere else , if you want to . The mill is closing up . " " Sure , " said Michael Towhig . " He 'll laugh to see us starving , setting there behind his two horses . All right , if he ai n't here , we 'll go to his house to-night to see him , and I guess he 'll see us there , "  |p246When  they were gone , Adam Munn could hear their footsteps still and the voices in the yard were louder . Yet in spite of the voices , there was a silence . The engines of the mill had stopped , the spindles had stopped turning , and the mill was closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inevitable , had stopped it as one might stop the ticking of a clock . Suddenlythe absence of that background of noise was ominous . Adam Munn glanced out the window quickly , at the rows of mill hands moving slowly down the street . All the street was filled with voices , now that the mill had closed . Adam Munn hurried through the office toward the spinning rooms , already gray and ghostly in the dusk . " Where 's the watchman ? " he shouted . " Where 's Joe Lynch ? " And then Joe Lynch came toward him in dripping oilskins , with a lantern in his hand . Joe Lynch 's face was shining wet from the rain . Joe was a steady man , as hard as nails , standing six feet two . " Did you hear ' em ? " Joe Lynch said . " The boys are getting ugly . " " Joe , " said Adam Munn , " go out and find a dozen men . There 're plenty out of work . And lock the gates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't you worry , Mr. Munn , " he said . " I 've got two dozen men already and they 're all fixed . Mr. Swale sent down word . Two dozen boys , all sworn in by the sheriff . Swale 's a hard man , Mr. Munn . " " Yes , " said Adam . The spinning room was growingp247darker ; the machinery stood before the windows , heavy and grotesque against the squares of fading light . Adam Munn had never been inside of the Swale house , for until that day no one had ever asked him in , and any one could tell it was no place to go without asking . Already it was part of the past , as frigid in its gentility as Dennis Swale , inhospitable , aloof . Its brick walls , its white cornices and cupola , its lawn with the white , festooned fence before it , made it something for the village boys to look at , even when Adam Munn was a boy . He could remember the feeling that the Swale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sheltering different people from those he knew . lie could remember , even when he was a boy , a feeling of pride and distaste when he looked at it , distaste for the aloofness of the Swales and of pride that there should be such people in the town . Back in the nineties it was already a place to show to strangers . " It 's the Swale house , " one would say . " Old Captain Daniel built it one hundred years ago , out of privateering money . They say it 's elegant inside . " And now that the rain was falling , as Adam Munn walked up the street , wrapped in his oilskin coat , it seemed to him that the Swale house was larger than it had ever been before . It was an enormous shadow among the elm trees on its lawn ; the shutters were drawn already , so that only a few cracks of light showed through , and its very darkness made it larger . It was larger than the tavern , it was larger than the Whistle house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It gave Adam Munn the feeling that he was going to a strange place , not to a haunted house ,  |p248but  to something which gave an impression as intangible as that , as he stood beneath the porch and raised the eagle knocker on the Swale front door . He had been in a hurry , until he raised the knocker , but as it came down with a hollow sound beneath his hand , that sound was almost like a voice admonishing and stern . " Mind your manners ! " it seemed to say . " There are only gentlemen here . " As he stood upon the porch in the dripping rain , the sound seemed all around him still ; it seemed to have roused other sounds , restive and half discernible . The rain was spattering against the bricks , the wind was moving through the trees , but there were other sounds . A white-haired , old Irish woman in a white apron opened the front door . It was Bridget O'Rourke , and though he had seen her often on her way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorway . " What do you want ? " she said . Before he answered , Adam found himself staring curiously at the hall . A lamp was standing on the table with a long gold mirror behind it but , even in the lamplight , the hall was dim . A broad white staircase curved upwards into the shadows , and there were pictures on the wall of men and women in peculiar , old-fashioned dress . And there was a musty smell , a strange odor of age , such as one encountered always in old houses . " What do you want ? " said Bridget . " I want to see Mr. Swale , " Adam answered . " You ca n't see him now , " said Bridget . " Mr. Swale is at his dinner . " The Swales had dinner in the evening , when all the rest had supper at Haven 's End.  |p249Adam  Munn looked at the hall again , and the faces in the pictures were staring at him , blankly , coldly , following him with their eyes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tell him it 's about the mill . " Then he was standing alone in the hall , with the door closed behind him , dripping wet , with his hat on his head dripping on the carpet . It was a queer place , the Swale hall , once the front door was closed . He seemed to be away from everything he knew , once the front door was closed . There were all sorts of sounds which he knew came from the wind and rain outside , but the sounds were different in the house . There were creaking noises like footsteps , and down the hall on the left he could hear the rattling of dishes . Then Bridget O'Rourke was back ; she seemed like one of the pictures as she came hurrying toward him , dim in the faint lamplight . " Mr. Swale will see you , " she said . " Take off your coat and wipe your feet upon the mat . He 's in the dining room , this way . " The dining room was very large and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all in colors . There was a sideboard along the wall , with silver upon it that shone in the light of two high candlesticks . In the center of the room was a round table , covered with a great white cloth , all white and silver , and there Mr. Dennis and Mrs. Swale were sitting , turning toward him as he walked through the door . Mrs. Swale was all billows and ruffles , like something very fine and delicate . Mrs. Swale was very rich , the story went . She was one of the Prydes from Philadel/phia , and Munn had seen her often in her carriage , but she was different seated at the table . She was as beautiful as the silver , as delicate as the china plates . You might touch her , Adam thought , and you would break her . But she was looking at him kindly , not the way that Mr. Dennis looked . " You 're early , Munn , " said Mr. Dennis . " I said half-past seven , did n't I ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've come about the mill . " Mr. Dennis reached for a decanter of claret and filled his glass . " Go into the library and wait . Bridget , show him to the library . " Then Mrs. Swale spoke and she was different and her voice was kind . " Bridget , " said Mrs. Swale , " set a place for Mr. Munn ; he 's hungry . Sit down , Mr. Munn . " " Thank you , Ma'am , " said Adam . His face was growing hot . " I can get along all right . " " Nonsense , " said Mrs. Swale . " Dennis , pass the claret to Mr. Munn . " Mr. Dennis did not answer ; he passed the claret over and he and the lady looked at each other across the table . And Mr. Dennis frowned and the lady smiled . " What 's the matter with the mill ? " she asked . " The men are angry , Ma'am , " said Adam , " because the mill is closing down . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his napkin on the table . " I thought they would , " he said . " Let ' em come . I 'll fix ' em . Thank you , Munn . Excuse me if I 'm rude . I 'm feeling very tired . "  | " It 's the stock market , " said Mrs. Swale ; and she laughed . " Never have anything to do with the stock market , Mr. Munn . Dennis , do you know , just the other day Alfred Deene was telling me  --  " " Suppose , " said Mr. Dennis , " we do n't speak of Alfred Deene . " " Why , Dennis ? " said Mrs. Swale , and she laughed again . " Why should n't Alfred tell me ? I suppose he can come here , if I want him . " That was all she said , but there was something more . And Adam Munn had sense enough to know it . He saw their glances meet again , and suddenly Mr. Dennis ' face grew red , and suddenly he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here behind my back , does he ? " said Mr. Dennis . " I thought he did . " " Dennis , " said Mrs. Swale , " please not now . " And she glanced at Adam Munn . Dennis Swale rose , though his dinner was half finished , and his face looked grey and wooden , like a very bad painting . And Adam Munn felt an embarrassmentwhich had nothing to do with his threadbare coat or the way in which he held his silver fork . " Munn , " said Mr. Dennis , " come into the library . Bridget , bring the brandy and cigars into the library . " And he walked out to the hall with Adam Munn behind him . There was something physical and distinct about it ; it seemed as though a crack had appeared in a blank , smooth wall , involuntarily showing something that was secret . For a sharp and quivering instant , Adam Munn had seen behind the facade of the Swales that night , and the Swales would never be the same to himp252again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great front door ; he had seen behind the glitter of the silver and the gestures and the modulated voice . The hardness of Mr. Dennis had not hidden it , nor the careless beauty of Mrs. Dennis , with her lace and her pearls and her fan . The staid silence of the house was breaking , and Dennis Swale was a man just like himself , a plain man with a restless wife . Once they were in the library , Mr. Dennis closed the door . Great shelves of dark-backed books made his face seem very white . Everything was dark in there , in spite of two lights and the dying embers of an open fire ; there was dark mahogany furniture and wine-red , damask curtains and dark pictures on the wall and dark , faded prints . It was all as dark as something in Dennis Swale . He was thinking of John Scarlet still . " Scarlet put ' em up to it , " he said . " All right . Let ' em come . " Mr. Dennis drank down his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigar was between his teeth , one could imagine it was a bit in the mouth of a stubborn horse . Mr. Dennis bowed his head and walked toward the fireplace with his quick , springy step . " Munn , " he said , " I 'm asking you a favor . Will you please keep quiet about what you heard ? My tongue slipped , Munn . " " About what , sir ? " asked Adam Munn , but , even when he asked , he knew it did no good to lie . Dennis Swale glanced at him and as their glances met , he could see right behind Dennis ' eyes , right into Dennis Swale . " Do n't be an ass , " said Mr. Dennis.  | " You 're clever , Munn . And any fool can put two and two together . I mean , " he lowered his voice , " about Mr. Alfred Deene . " " No , sir , " said Adam Munn . " I 'm not the talking kind . " Mr. Dennis drew in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There are some things one does n't talk about , you see , " he said . " I believe in good high fences , Munn . There 's something in a name . " It must have been hard for Mr. Dennis to say as much as that , because Mr. Dennis was a proud man . He was proud , but after all he was a man like everybody else . " And now , " said Mr. Dennis , " what 's this about the mill ? You say some hands are coming up to see me ? Well , Scarlet put ' em up to it . " " It 's a deputation , sir , " said Adam Munn . " They want to ask you not to close the mill and throw them out of work . I  --  well , I ca n't hardly blame them . " Mr. Dennis smiled and leaned against the corner of the mantlepiece . " And what good do they think it will do to ask me ? Do you think I 'll give Scarlet satisfaction ? Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Do they think they own the place ? I suppose they think I 'm made of money . Do they think I 'll throw it in the street ? " " Just the same , " said Adam Munn , " I 'd treat them square , if I were you . It is n't as though you could n't afford it . It would n't hurt you with anybody to treat them right . Maybe you do n't know , sir , what everybody'ssaying. "  |p254Mr  . Dennis threw his cigar in the fire ; there was a splutter of sparks from the embers where it fell . " Why , confound you ! Do you think I care what people think ? " Some barrier had broken down between them . Adam Munn was not afraid of Dennis then . " Yes , " he said , " I used to think you did n't . You 're biting off your nose to spite Scarlet 's face  --  that 's all . " " Why , Munn , " said Mr. Swale . " Why , Munn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Listen , " said Adam Munn . " Here they 're coming now . " " Why , damn their insolence ! " said Dennis Swale . Outside there was a sound of voices and there was a knocking on the door . And he looked toward the hallway with a sharp-lined face . There was a noise of voices outside , loud and foreign  --  such as the Swale house had never heard . The mountain had moved to Mohammed . The whole Swale mill had moved from the river up the street , and forces were moving with it which no one like Mr. Swale could understand . Somethingwas stirring in those voices that was clear and strong , though one could not catch the meaning . Yet , waiting in the library , Adam Munn could grasp it vaguely . Mass was moving against privilege , in its endless , restless way , and there was a justce about it as clearly defined as the laws of gravity and time and space . Two old forces were in conflict and the plebeians were moving against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " light another of those lamps . I 'll see the men in here . " Adam 's fingers trembled as he lit the lamp , becausep255there was something ominous hovering over all that place , and the injustice and the hardness of the Swales and their cruelty were coming home to roost . It was the end of something which had started long ago . Yet the room was different in the added light . Suddenly there was something in it untouchable , like the sublimation of some thought . Mr. Dennis himself , with his long nose and his sideboards and his long , thin hands , was suddenly good to look at . " All right , " said Mr. Dennis , " show them in . " Though there were only five of them , they seemed to fill the room , as they stood dripping with rain . First there was Michael Towhig , staring curiously at the books , and then there was a Frenchman named Bill Trudeau , and behind them an Italian and two swarthy Portuguese . There was something in the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and touched the back of one of the chairs and others shuffled their feet softly on the carpet . " What do you want ? " said Dennis Swale . He stepped away from the fireplace to look at them incuriously . " Stop wiping your feet on my carpet and tell me what you want . What 's the matter ? Have you lost your tongues ? " Michael Towhig cleared his throat and rubbed the back of his hand across his nose . " Mr. Swale , " he said , " are you going to close the mill ? " " You saw the sign , " said Dennis Swale . " Mr. Swale , " said Michael Towhig , " what right have you got to keep the poor out of work ? That 's what I want to know . "  | " Towhig , " said Mr. Dennis , " ask Mr. Scarlet that . He 'll be more interested than I am . I 'm not under any obligation to you . I 'll give you work when there is work , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ah ! " It was Trudeau speaking . " You get nothing out of him . Ah , shut up and come away . " " You give us work , " said Michael Towhig , " or you watch your mills . That 's all . " " So that 's it , is it ? " Mr. Dennis lighted another of his cigars . " So that 's Scarlet 's idea too ? Now listen to me and keep your voices down . I know how to deal with you . I 'm ready for you . Who asked you to come here ? I did n't . You 've got money in the savings bank . Why do n't you live on that ? Now go out quietly . There wo n't be trouble here . " " Wo n't there ? " Mr. Towhig 's voice became a shout . " Be gob , we 'll burn your damned old mill . " " Try it , " said Mr. Dennis . " But let me tell you this , for your own good . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm no friend of yours . I 've got men and shotguns waiting for you to try it , and I have a dozen men in the kitchen waiting to put you out of this house . Do you want me to call them ? Or will you go without it ? " Michael Towhig rubbed his hand across his face in a slow , bewildered way . " Mr. Swale , " he said , " have n't you any heart ? Mr. Scarlet ai n't laying off his men . " " No , " said Mr. Dennis , " but I 'm not Scarlet  --  nor do I do what Scarlet wants . Suppose you remember that . " There was a bewilderment on those men that was amusing , almost , as they gazed at Dennis Swale.  |p257Obviously  , it had never occurred to them that he might meet force with force . They stood with their mouths half gaping and their heavy red hands half open at their sides , pathetic in their amazement and simplicity . And Dennis Swale looked at them with the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They all were Scarlets to him then . " So now you 're whistling down the wind ? " he said . " First you come to bully me , and when you ca n't do that , you beg . What 's the matter with you men ? " And for the moment Dennis himself looked puzzled . " I 've treated you fairly and it never helped me . Get out and go home quietly . " " What I tell you ? " It was Trudeau speaking again excitedly . " I say it does no good . Come on , get out . " " Mr. Swale , " said Michael Towhig , " have n't you any heart ? " " Munn , " said Dennis Swale , " will you show these men out , please ? " Adam Munn could remember what happened next as clearly as if it were the night before . The library door was open to the hall . He could remember looking toward it when there was a gust of wind that set the lamps to flickering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whoever it was had been running , for there was a sound of sharp-drawn breaths . " Who 's that ? " shouted Dennis . " Shut the door . " " Mr. Swale , " some one was calling . " Is that you , Mr. Swale ? " Then Adam Munn saw who it was . It was Mr. Alex Brill , the cashier of the Penny Bank . Mr. Brill wasp258generally a thin , neat man , but now he was hatless and dishevelled by the wind . His breath was coming in sharp gasps , and he reached toward the wall to steady himself . The thing that Adam remembered best were the faces , for the whole room seemed filled with strange , staring faces . " Brill , " said Dennis Swale , " whatever is the matter ? " " It 's the bank . " Mr. Brill seemed to forget that they were not alone . " I 've just been to the bank and now I 've come up here . " That was all that Mr. Brill said , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all at once his face went white , but he kept his voice on an even key . " Sit down , " he said . " Suppose you have been to the bank . What makes you look like that ? " " I swear , " said Mr. Brill , " I swear it was n't my fault . " " What was n't your fault ? " said Dennis Swale . " Ca n't you pull yourself together ? " Mr. Brill was not built to stand great strain ; he was a quiet , accurate , easy man and nothing more , and something had broken him , and it robbed him of his poise and of his judgment . It was startling to see him in his chair , wide-eyed and motionless , stunned by something in his mind . " I knew he was speculating , " said Mr. Brill . " Of course , I knew that much . " " Oh ! " said Mr. Dennis . " Who was speculating ? " " Him , " said Mr. Brill . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my God ! We ca n't open up to-morrow . " " How 's that ? " Michael Towhig had been listeningp259and already any one could guess what had happened . " Has the bank gone busted ? " " Mr. Swale , " said Mr. Brill , " the assets have been twisted . There is n't  --  there is n't  --  " " Where 's Deene ? " said Dennis Swale . " Has he killed himself ? " " No , " said Mr. Brill , " he 's took the train and gone . " " That 's not so , " said Dennis Swale . " I saw him myself this morning . " " He got a telegram , " said Mr. Brill . " He 's took the train and gone . " Dennis Swale stood up straighter , but he seemed cloaked in a most preposterous stupidity ; he was going over something very slowly , step by step . " But he told me this morning everything was all right , " said Dennis Swale . " Did he ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on you , is n't it ? Ha , ha , ha ! " And Mr. Brill began to laugh and laugh , doubling himself over like a knife . " Stop it , " said Dennis Swale . " Will you stop that noise ? " " Ha , ha ! " shouted Mr. Brill . " That 's one on you , all right . " " Will some one take this man out ? Wo n't some one take him somewhere ? " Then he stopped ; he was staring at something and everybody turned . Even Mr. Brill turned in his chair . Mrs. Swale was in the library and it was no place for Mrs. Swale . She was like a little china ornament , in her evening dress , and her pink and white face was as petulant as a child 's . " Dennis , " she said , " do we have to have all thisp260shouting ? I ca n't imagine what 's got into you . Whateverare these men ? Whatever is the matter ? " " My dear , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Dennis , " said Mrs. Swale , " I wo n't be spoken to like that . " " Oh , damnation ! " said Mr. Dennis . " Do n't you see your being here only makes things worse ? " " Why , Dennis , " cried Mrs. Swale , " why , Dennis , how dare you swear ? " Suddenly she was a silly little woman , as silly as a doll , and as incongruous as a doll , and strangely enough , Mr. Towhig was the man who grasped the situation and took the matter in his hands . " Sure , Ma'am , " said Mr. Towhig , " this ai n't no place for a pretty lady now . The bank has busted and Mr. Deene has gone away . " " Gone away ? " Her voice was tremulous and faint . " Mr. Deene has gone away ? " " He 's run away , " said Dennis Swale . " Run like a coward , if you want to know . " " And he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hush , " said Dennis Swale . " Why should he tell you ?  --  Call one of the maids . The lady 's fainted . " Mr. Dennis had sprung forward and had caughther in his arms . " Come on , " said Michael Towhig . " Come on , boys . Seeing a lady 's present , I wo n't say what I was going to say . Come on , boys . He 's getting paid enough . " Dennis Swale did not answer and perhaps he never heard ; he was gazing at his wife 's white face and he never turned his head.  |p261Adam  's mother was the one who asked him , when Adam got back home . The Munns lived in one of those white frame houses facing the river , near the mill . Like old Mrs. Munn , it all was very neat . The mantle ornaments were dusted , standing exactly so . The lamp burned brightly behind its globe of painted flowers . There was a flowered tapestry carpet and chromos on the wall . Years afterwards , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same straight , even line . " Adam , " said Mrs. Munn . She was like an old witch of a woman then , wraithlike , querulous , as Adam was to grow in time . " What 's been keeping you ? What 's that they tell me down the street ? Adam , has the bank gone busted ? " " Yes , " said Adam Munn . He remembered he was very tired . It was after his supper hour and there would be no supper for him , since he was not on time . Mrs. Munn set down her knitting and her false teeth gave a click , like the snapping of a metal box . " I want to know , " she said . " He said the bank was sound . " " Yes , " said Adam Munn , " yes , he said it . " Mrs. Munn 's teeth went snap again . She had known adversity too long to let it stun her , and she was not the sort to start in weeping . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More fool me , to trust them Swales . Sly , that 's what he is . He did it for his own good , like as not . Go out to the well and fetch a pail of water ; there wo n't be a new pump in the kitchen now . " " No , " said Adam Munn , " he would n't have done that . "  | " You 're simple , like your father , " said Mrs. Munn . " Them Swales are always sly . " " I do n't know , " said Adam . " I do n't know ; there 's something in them Swales . " She treated him still like a little boy . He was in his attic room beneath the eaves , listening to the rain , but for a long while he could not sleep , and when he slept it was not like sleeping . All night , he seemed to hear the rain like pattering , hurried feet , and now and then the bell from the old First Church was ringing through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And in his mind , as though he still were there , was the Swale hall and the library and the faces of the Swales , longnosed , arrogant in their gilt frames  --  Swales in black coats , Swales in blue coats , Swales in ruffles , Swales in strange cravats . Then , all at once , he was awake ; the room was gray and cold , and his mother was knocking on the door . " Wake up ! " she said . " Get up . Swale 's black man 's calling for you . " Malachi Cuffy , the black Swale coachman , was standing in the sitting room , tall and grave in his black coat , holding his high silk hat . " Mr. Adam , " he said , " Master Dennis wants you . He wants you right away . " " Where ? " said Adam . " At the mill ? " " At the big house , " said Malachi . " He wants you right away . " It seemed to Adam Munn that there must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rain had stopped , but the morning was cold and gray , and from the ground and from the river a cold gray mist wasp263rising . The Swale house was very still ; so that he could hear the drops of moisture falling from the elms , splash on the sodden lawn . The hall was very silent , so that one spoke in whispers . Mr. Dennis was in the dining room , but he had not touched his breakfast . He was like a man who had stared death in the face and who had watched death take its course . Yet his voice was as sharp and harsh as ever . His collar was white and stiff . His cravat was carefully tied with a moonstone pin stuck in it . " Munn , " he said , " I 'm going to the bank . Would you mind coming too ? " " No , " said Adam , " I 'll come if you want me . " " Thanks , " said Mr. Dennis . " There 's no one else to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hat and stick . " He did not speak for a long time as they walked down the street . Though Adam tried , he could not tell what Dennis Swale was thinking . His cane went snap upon the brick walk and he held his head up straight . Adam Munn did not speak , because he felt a curious sort of awe . Dennis Swale seemed far away , different from everything in Haven 's End , very lonely and set apart and thinking , always thinking . Only once did he look at Adam Munn with a quick , sharp look . " You 're right , " he said . " Deene fooled me . " " It is n't your fault , " said Adam . " You 're not anywaysto blame . " " I said the bank was sound , " said Dennis Swale . The street outside the bank was full of people standingsilent , staring at the brownstone walls . There werep264men in overalls and women with shawls about their heads . Their faces all were stamped with the same bewilderedlook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left in Haven 's End . " Look at them , " said Mr. Dennis . " I said the bank was sound . " " Lookit , " some one was calling . " Lookit ; here comes Swale . " Then he could imagine every one was looking as Dennis Swale walked down the street . There was a whispering and the shuffling of a hundred feet , but every one was looking , and it seemed to Adam Munn that there was nothing strange in that , for Haven 's End had always watched the Swales . Staring straight before him , Mr. Dennis moved along and every one stepped back . They must have also had that feeling that Dennis Swale was different from the rest . Mr. Dennis did not seem to be aware that they were looking ; he walked up the brownstone steps and brought his cane down on the bank 's closed door . " Lookit , " some one was saying , " Swale is going in . Lookit , there goes Swale . " Mr. Brill was the one who opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . The shades of the banking room were drawn ; there were no clerks behind the desks . There was a different sort of silence in that bank from any that Adam had ever known . The lack of sound was heavy as a load upon one 's shoulders ; the marble squares of the floor before the counter , still unmoppedfrom the day before , showed a muddy blur of footsteps , with bits of crumpled paper lying all about.  |p265On  the bars of the teller 's cage a notice had been pasted . Mr. Dennis thrust his head forward to read it through the shadows . " As a director of the Penny Bank , I have examined the figures , and to the best of my belief the Bank is sound . " And underneath it he could see the harsh angles of his signature . " Take that thing down , " said Dennis . " There 's no further use for that . " Then he turned to the directors ' room , with Adam Munn walking by his elbow . There were half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Boston had come already and was calling for the books . The other directors of the bank were there , most of them small tradesmen . The merchants had changed to small tradesmenwith the decline of Haven 's End . " Good morning ! " said some one , and then some one else spoke up . " Good morning , Mr. Swale . " Mr. Dennis nodded and stepped to the round table with its thick green baize and sat down on one of the ornate armchairs . Then he looked around the room very slowly , aware , perhaps , that every one was waiting for him to speak , but he did not say a word . " It 's a black morning , " said Mr. Brill , " for all of us , Mr. Swale . " Mr. Dennis turned to Adam Munn . " Get me a piece of paper and a pen , " he said . And then he sat stiffly with his eyes on nothing . " Mr. Swale , " said some one , " do you want to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dennis , " I do n't want to see it now . "  |p266He  picked up the pen and dipped it in the ink . " This is a damned bad pen , " he said . " Do you want another one ? " asked Adam . " No , " said Mr. Dennis , " this will do , but it 's a damned bad pen . " He must have known exactly what he was to write , for his pen moved without a pause , once he started writing . When he had finished , he tossed the pen on the table and pushed back his chair . " You can read that if you like , " he said . " Brill , get a pot of glue and paste that on the door . " Then every one leaned forward . Years later , Adam Munn could close his eyes and still see how the paper looked . It was a piece of heavy ruled foolscap , he remembered ; it lay askew upon the green baize table , among cigar ashes and memorandum slips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row of spears . " Having said this bank is sound , " it read , and the writing was as uncompromising as Mr. Dennis ' voice , " I guarantee to the full extent of my resources that every depositor will be paid . " " You see it , " said Mr. Dennis . " You can witness that I wrote it . All right , put it on the door . " He had written it as though it were a simple letter , and everything had been so simple that what he had done seemed to dawn on everybody slowly . " But , see here ! " It was Mr. Savory , the bank 's attorney , who broke the silence . " There 's no need for you to do a thing like that . You 're no wise liable , Mr. Swale . A bank director serving without pay is no wise liable . " Mr. Dennis turned and nodded and he even smiled  | " Thanks , " he said , " but I know when I 'm liable withoutgoing to the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brill . " You do n't know what you 're doing . You do n't know what the assets and liabilities are . " Mr. Dennis raised his eyebrows . " What 's that got to do with it ? " he inquired . " This is my affair and I 'm not asking what you think . I said this bank was sound . Well , it will stay sound if I can make it , and I want every one to know it . Get that notice on the door . " He looked around the room again sharply , almost arrogantly . " I wanted witnesses . I do n't care a continentalwhat you think . " Then some one was speaking in a hushed , awestrickenvoice . " I did n't know , " some one was saying , " there was any one like that in town . " Dennis Swale reached for his hat and gloves . " Do n't be a fool , " he said . " Come on , Munn . There 's nothing else to do . " It was curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; all the obstinacy of the Swales seemed altered into something fine . All at once , everybodyknew that there was no one like the Swales left in Haven 's End . " What 's that noise ? " said Dennis Swale . There was a shouting in the street . " They 're cheering , " said Adam Munn . " Ai n't they got a right to cheer ? " " Who ? " said Dennis Swale . " For me ? " " Yes , " said Adam Munn , " for you . " Then he was out on the steps in the gray , harsh light ,  |p268but  everything seemed different ; an invisible wave seemed to rise to meet him , so that he paused for a moment before he walked down the steps . " There 's Swale , " some one was shouting . " Hooray for Mr. Swale ! " Then they all were cheering ; people were running from the shops ; the street was full of noise . The thing that Adam Munn remembered best was the look in Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised or even pleased that every one was cheering ; he seemed to take it quite for granted that every one should cheer a Swale in the streets of Haven 's End . It was surprising , even then , that no one tried to touch him , that no one tried to shake his hand . He was still apart from every one as he walked down the steps , unique , beyond the common thought . " God bless you , Mr. Swale , " some one was shouting . And Dennis nodded once and stepped out on the street , waving his cane before him . His manner no longer seemed preposterous and everything seemed in its place , all orderly and fitting . They were down the steps and on the street when there was another sound ; the bell from the First Church was ringing , tolling out the hour , and the bell was like a voice above the other voices . " Swale , " it was saying slowly , " Swale , Swale , Swale . " And then a strange thing happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every one was moving back as Dennis Swale walked on , except one man , who stood before him until Dennis finally stopped . He and Mr. Scarlet were standing face to face , there in the street . Dennis Swale looked up at Mr. Scarlet andp269tucked his cane beneath his arm . Mr. Scarlet raised his hat ; he was holding it in his hand . " Mr. Swale , " he was calling , " wait a minute , Mr. Swale . " Dennis Swale looked up . In the sound of all the voices , the lines of his face seemed gone ; he seemed young and almost kindly as he glanced at Mr. Scarlet . " Mr. Swale , " said Mr. Scarlet , " I did n't know there was a man alive who would do a thing like that ! " " Do n't be a fool , " said Dennis Swale . " It was the only thing to do . " Noblesse oblige . John Scarlet had never heard of that , but he must have seen the sense of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen it as every one saw it , rising bright above the dullness of the town . It always seemed to Adam Munn that the thing that Dennis Swale did next was inevitable , beyond his own volition . Mr. Dennis drew a paper from his pocket . " Now this , " he said ; " there 's this . . . " Mr. Scarlet looked quickly at the paper and back at Dennis Swale . It was like Dennis Swale to remember even at a time like that . He was holding the notes of John Scarlet in his fingers . They had been in his pocket all the while . " Now these , " said Mr. Dennis . " I was just coming down to ask you  --  " " I 'm not begging , " John Scarlet said . " You 've got me , Mr. Swale . " " Yes , " said Dennis , and he nodded very slowly , " and I do n't want it . It 's . . . Listen to them , Scarlet . "  |p270Was  it all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Swale ? " Scarlet , " said Mr. Dennis , " take this and pay it up next year . There 's no reason for this now . " " Here , " said Mr. Scarlet , " wait a minute . I do n't understand . " Dennis Swale was smiling in a way which would have been insufferable half an hour before . John Scarlet was standing before him , with his hat grasped in his hand . " Do n't you ? " said Mr. Swale . " There 's no reason that you should . Have I ever asked you or any one to understand ? " Tom SwaletC SNOfS . iINIlINLS "  |p273EVERY  ONE IN OUR TOWN KNEW TOMSwale . There is something in the echo of the name in our town still , though it is lost among all the other echoes whispering on the wind . Suppose you walked down Middle Street , past the old distillery to the river , where the waves are slapping against the soft swirl of the tide . Let it be the time toward sundown , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the river , in a mellow golden light , and suppose you stood on the piling of the wharves and shouted out the name  --  Tom Swale  --  the sound would not be strange . It would fall in peaceful order upon all the other sounds that have stirred the air of Haven 's End . " Tom ! Tom Swale ! " You can remember how old Dennis Swale used to call him in his harsh , flat voice . It was not so long ago . It was down by the old yard where the Swales built the wooden chasers in Nineteen Seventeen , the last of the wooden ships that came outp274of Haven 's End . You can see the last unfinished hull still standing in the blocks , already gray and weathered , just as they left it when the war was over . " Tom ! Tom Swale ! " Perhaps you can remember the old man 's voice above the hammering , for Haven 's End in those days was stirring from its sleep . " Get down off that scaffolding ! Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tom , " some one would say , " your old man 's call-ing . " Then Tom would look up quickly . His face was as sharp as his father 's face . He had the same long nose , high cheeks and narrow mouth of all the Swales , but his eyes were different . They seemed always to be looking toward the distance at things one did not see . " Yes , " he said , " I hear him . He 's afraid I 'm going to die and then there would n't be a Swale . " Then Tom Swale would laugh . His narrow lips would draw apart and his whole face would change until any one could feel his amusement at absurdity . He was laughing at a vanity that must have been in him too , laughing at the town and the Swale house on the ridge above the river . And he was laughing at an old man 's fear , secure in that illusion of immortality which is never lost to youth . There used to be a garish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotting , which would bring the whole thing back . It was like a ruined buildingwhen you saw it in the dusk , poignant , lonely , like all the vanished hopes which the river bank had seen since the shipping had died out , and Haven 's End had grown small and narrow . It lay like the last effortp275of the Swales , their last fling , like our town 's last fling against a changing time . The sight of it would bring back that glimmer of excitement just before the war , when Dennis Swale was making money out of wooden ships , and when the tide of money turned back to Haven 's End . And Dennis was the one who turned the tide . Any one could tell you that . He was already old in that restive time , when values toppled and wages rose , but he thought of wooden ships . . . . The yard was like a great house falling to decay , and right beside the rusted , barbed-iron fence the Scarlet shoe shop stood , freshly painted like something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building , like the Scarlets in our town . A sign was reared in front of it in clear black letters , so that you could see it across that lonely yard , and that sign was like the ending of a story , as patently New England as the white houses and the elms . " John Scarlet , " it said . " Shoes and Findings . " Old Dennis Swale used to stare at it when the hammersand the saws were going . That sign represented the new commercialism , since everything was going into signs . " Findings ? " Dennis Swale once said . " What are findings , I 'd like to know ? " And then he smiled and gave his head a shake . " A trade word , " he said . That was the strange part about it . He never seemed to think that he was in trade himself ; and that was like the Swales . The shipyard was always something more than that . " Findings ! " said Dennis Swale and then he laughed . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nothing strange about his laughing , because the Swales had laughed at Scarlets since our town began . The Scarlets were rich in those days , and they were solid people , but when Dennis spoke , you had a picture of old John Scarlet and young John Scarlet with bended backs , grubbing for their findings , the last of grubbing generations . And there you had the story standing straight before you , like all the stories of our town , with all the hopes of Dennis Swale rotting in the dark and the name of Scarlet black and clear , and you could almost hear the echo of Dennis ' voice . " Tom ! " he was calling . " Ca n't you hear , Tom Swale ? " Sue Swale was the one to tell you , if you knew her . Susan was Tom 's sister , and in a way to blame . She had been in the Swale House as long as she could remember , and she could see it through her father 's eyes . When you saw her in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when one stepped in out of the summer sun , you could imagine her stepping from some shadowy chaos of all the other Swales who had walked that hall , and she alone seemed real . " The house is awfully old , " she said . " You understand it when you live here . " You could understand it when she told you . It was not like one of those museum houses , because the Swales were there . She could show you the rusty cut-andthrustsword which Colonel Richard Swale had worn when he led a company in King Philip 's War . She could show you the silver in the dining room which Swalep277privateers had taken . She could show you the paintings of the Swale ships , heavy Federalist vessels , with every rope and spar in accurate proportion ; but , when she showed them , all those things seemed to come together into an austere , vague shape . There was something in it which made her sad , as though she knew her own inadequacy . Yet she could put it all together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house and shrug her shoulders at it ,  --  pretty , awkward shoulders . " You see , " Sue said , " that I do n't matter . There had to be a man to keep it all together . Now , let 's go out . I 'll tell you all about it out of doors . " She could sometimes think that they were never grown , she and her brother Tom . Whenever she began to think back , there would be Sue Swale and Tom , walking down the street in the hot summer sun . Her dress would be white and starched , with lace upon it . Tom would be in an Eton collar , and the wind would be always blowing the straight part from his hair . Then there would be the voices , half hushed and half derisive . " Lookit , there 's the Swale kids ! " They were always different from the rest of Haven 's End . Dennis Swale could never see that he was standing for a worn-out custom , but Sue Swale must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She could see how the Victorian world was cracking before the war sent it galley-west . " Are you laughing ? " Sue Swale said . " I do n't blame you laughing . We 're preposterous . The whole thing was preposterous ,  --  little , small-town people livingp278in a house out of repair and acting as if we were important . And we were n't nice . We were nasty . . . . But Father believed in it . It 's queer how things grow real , if some one just believes enough . " Yes , Susan could piece it all together , perhaps because she hated pompous make-believe . She was not the heir to the make-believe . She was not the one her father watched , but his voice was always chiming with her thoughts . " Tom , keep the safety lock on that duck gun . . . . If it 's blowing in the harbor , do n't you take that boat outside . Do you think I want you drowned ? " On a long walk beside the marshes she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all back , when it blew at her short tweed skirt and set the strands of hair blowing across her forehead . As she looked across the marshes toward the sand dunes , her lips would twist upward , not exactly in a smile . " Yes , " she said , " do you believe in premonition ? I do , sometimes . Father always was afraid . There were the things he stood for . There had to be a Swale . " Then all the rest would come back to her  --  the voices and the faces that once had stirred her thoughts . . . . " Father , " she was saying , " what 's the matter ? " And there would be old Dennis Swale , standing in the library in his woolen dressing gown , looking out the window toward the black and quiet street . " Nothing , " he was saying , " but I ca n't sleep . You 'll find out when you 're old . " And Susan knew that all the things he stood for werep279moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but old voices . Then there would be candlelight . John Scarlet told her that much . A candle would be burning on a damp board among the smells of moldy earth . Tom Swale would be standing , muddy but somehow clean in that dim yellow light , looking at John Scarlet 's red , perspiringface . " What time do you make it ? " John Scarlet was saying . " How long before zero ? " Then Tom Swale was looking at him . She could imagine just how he looked . " Five minutes , " Tom Swale was saying . " You better set your watch . See you later , John . " " Where ? " John Scarlet said . " Good Lord ! " Tom Swale was saying . " How should I know where ? " Sue could not have been sixteen in those days before the war disturbed the peace of Haven 's End , but she could remember exactly how it was , because it always seemed like yesterday . It was June ; Sue Swale could remember June , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . The sun was coming through the curtains of her bedroom window , bringing the shadows of leaves which danced upon the curtains of her little four-posted bed . The sunlight glanced from the mirror on her dressing table and back to her dark , brown hair , making it almost golden as she combed it . She remembered looking at the mirror with a sudden , sharp surprise at the brightness of her eyes and the straightness of her lips . It was as though she had never seen her face all those other mornings.  | " Why , Sue , " she said , " you 're beautiful ! " It was not strange that she remembered , since it was the first time that she knew . It was the first time she understood why John Scarlet had stared at her as though she had been a stranger , when he met her on the street , and perhaps one should begin with that . She had been walking down the street when John Scarlet came around the corner just by the old First Church . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haven 's End , that he was the son of old John Scarlet who owned the shoe factory by the river  --  a solid , red-faced boy with heavy hands . " Hello , " he said , " I did n't know you , Sue . " " Hello , " she said , " you ought to . " Then something made her smile and pause . Why was it that she smiled ? John Scarlet was in a blue serge suit such as the town boys wore , but she did not smile at that . " Yes , I ought to , " John Scarlet said . His voice had a singsong drawl , very slow and quiet , " but I never thought  --  " " What about ? " she said . The sun was moving on the old brick walk . She remembered exactly how the leaves made patterns on it that never stayed the same because the wind was blowing . " I never thought , " John Scarlet said , " you looked like you do now . " " Did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " I 've got my boat out . I 'll take you out to-morrow , if you 'd like to go . " " Yes , " she said , " I 'd like it . "  |p281And  that was all  --  his voice and her voice speaking words . She could say them over , one by one . There was a sort of peace in remembering exactly how they went , a gentleness and a kindness which she had never known , without a touch of pretense , without a flash of fire , and she knew why he asked her , now that she saw her face . That was all , but everything seemed new . There was a simplicity about it which she could never quite forget . He had nearly said that she was beautiful , and it did not seem strange . Wide , patient eyes which looked at her and quietly looked away , steady shoulders , fresh color in his cheeks . . . . " I do n't care , " she said . " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love him . " " Sue , " she heard her brother 's voice outside the door . " Sue , are you up yet ? " Tom Swale was in his bathrobe with a wet towel around his head . " Why , Sue , " he said , " you 're damn good-looking . I never thought of that . " " Did n't you ? " said Sue . " Do you want me to get you something ? " " Yes , give me a glass of water . I came in to say good morning . What are you dressed up for ? What are you doing to your hair ? " " Nothing , " said Sue . " Where were you last night ? " Tom waved his arm vaguely . " Here and there , " he said . " Tom . " Sue felt her voice grow hushed ; she always felt an awe at the things Tom had seen and done . " Tom , were you  --  "  | " Yes . Have n't you got eyes ? And do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You need n't say that , " said Sue . " You know I do n't tell . " " That 's right , " said Tom . He sat down on the edge of her bed and swung his feet slowly back and forth . " I 'll tell you something else . There 's hell to pay in Mexico . There 's going to be a war . " " Tom ! " She started from her dressing table . " You 're not going , are you ? " She remembered how Tom swung his legs back and forth and crossed his hands behind his head . " Why not ? " he said . " But , Tom , " she said . " Tom , you must n't go . " " Think I 'll get killed , do n't you ? Well , who 's going to stop me going ? " " Father is , " said Sue . For a moment Tom Swale did not answer . His eyes opened wider and he unwound the towel from his head . Some water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , thin nose . " Sue , " said Tom , " my head is aching fit to bust . We 've got to stick together , Sue . " Then they were down in the dining room . The coffee urn was boiling ; the windows were open so that there was a smell of fresh grass and coffee . Dennis Swale was seated by the coffee urn , reading his morning mail . Everything in that room seemed curiously his own . It was always so in the whole house , when Dennis Swale was there . The carpet , unchanged for twenty years , was worn into little paths , the block-print wallpaper ofp283ships and lighthouses was dingy , half the brasses had fallen from the sideboard , two Chippendale chairs had broken backs , but when Dennis Swale was in the room , everything was complete . " Well , " said Dennis , " well . " He never said good morning ; she always remembered that . " Pour out the coffee , Sue , " he said . " Tom , where were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Tom . " And drunk , " said Dennis Swale . " Yes , sir , " said Tom . There was no good to lie . " That 's right , " said Dennis Swale , " do n't lie . " His face was the same as always , but somehow he was different ; " Tom , " he said , " I 've bought the old shipyard . What do you think of that ? " " Sir , " said Tom , " what did you do that for ? " " The old shipyard ? " said Sue . " Why , there 's nothing there . " " Be quiet , Sue , " said Dennis Swale . " I 'm talking to your brother . I 've bought the yard and I 'm going to build a ship . Tom , you 're going there this morning . " " A ship ? " said Tom . He was staring across the table . " What kind of a ship ? " " A wooden ship , a schooner , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " but why ? " Dennis Swale leaned back in his chair , as though he had said nothing strange . " To make money , " said Dennis Swale . " Now I know what I 'm talking about . There 's enough tonnage being sunk to make a market for wooden ships . Your greatgrandfatherbuilt them , and you 're going to buildp284them . Hurry with your breakfast ; we 're going to go there now . " " But , look , " said Tom , " I do n't know how . " " No , " said Dennis , " but you 're going to learn . I did n't think it would ever happen . There 'll be ships on the river again . " The coffee was boiling with little puffs of steam and , all at once , everything seemed changing when he spoke , and Susan could tell that he had been thinking of the idea for weeks and months , turning it in his mind until it seemed already done . Dennis looked across the table straight at Tom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " we 're going to lay one down . They can laugh if they want to , but they 'll see there 's money in it . And shipping 's an essential industry . Hurry with your breakfast , Tom . " She remembered , when Tom sat looking , that his eyes were dark and puzzled . " All right , " said Tom . " But if there 's a war , I 'm going to it just the same . " Dennis Swale set down his coffee cup . " Well , you 're not , " he said . He did not raise his voice . " You 're the only son I 've got . That 's why I 'm going into shipping , one of the reasons why . They wo n't call shipyard workers out . I 've looked into that . " " Look here , " said Tom . " I knew there was somethingfunny about this . You ca n't fix everything  --  " Dennis Swale drew in his breath . There was something in his face which made Tom look away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shout at me . You 're staying here , " he said . " Some one has to live here after I am gone . "  |p285There  was no trace of emotion in the way he said it , but Sue could understand . There were so many things her father could never say ; all his thoughts were on Tom Swale . " But I might go to war and live , " said Tom . " Did you ever think of that ? " " No , " said Dennis Swale . " But why ? " said Tom . " Wo n't you tell me why ? " " Because I 'm afraid , " said Dennis Swale . " God help me , I 'm afraid . " In the silence which followed , they could hear the click of cart wheels or the sound of a motor horn on the street , and then the bell of the First Church was ringing , tolling out the hour of nine . Tom 's face had grown red and so had her father 's face , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had happened of which they were both ashamed . It was an amazing thing , but like him . It never seemed strange to her that her father started shipbuilding to keep his son from war . " Give me some coffee , Sue , " said Dennis Swale . And then the doorbell rang , and Sue tried not to start . " Who 's that ? " said Dennis Swale . " A young man , sir , " the maid said . " He wants to see Miss Susan . " Susan felt her face grow hot because her father 's eyes were on her . " A young man ? " her father said . " What young man ? " " It 's Mr. Scarlet , sir . Young Mr. Scarlet , whose father owns the shoe shop . "  |p286Dennis  Swale pushed back his chair . His forehead was broken in little furrows . " What does he want ? " her father said . Susan looked up at him and looked away , now that her turn had come . " He wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got his catboat out . " " Sailing ? " said Tom . Dennis Swale sat looking at her ; his forehead still in lines . " You were n't going to go ? " he asked . " Yes , " she said , " I said I 'd go . " " What 's that ? " said Tom . " You said you 'd go ? " " Be quiet , " her father said . There was a footstep in the hall and then John Scarlet was standing near the window in the sun . His hat was in his hand and his face was very red , and Dennis Swale was looking at him , rubbing his hands softly one against the other . As John Scarlet stood there in the dining room , Susan felt as though an iron door had slammed ; she had never thought of John Scarlet standing in their house . John Scarlet had looked well enough in his blue suit by the church , but in the Swale house he was different , suddenly ill at ease ; his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing by the window . She had never felt so sorry for any one as she did for him . He was not like them and he must have known it , for his voice sounded husky when he spoke . " Good morning , Sue , " he said . " Good morning , Mr. Swale . Good morning , Tom . "  | " Morning , John , " said Tom . " Where did you get that tie ? " John Scarlet put his hand up to his collar ; his tie was a flaming red , exactly like his face , and suddenly it seemed to Sue that Tom and Dennis Swale were just alike ; their faces had the same look , half-surprised and half-amused , hard , sharp , watchful masks , staring at John Scarlet with cool , unblinking eyes . " Well , " said Dennis Swale , " I understand you 've asked my daughter to go sailing . " " Yes , sir , " said John Scarlet . " Yes , leastways I thought she might like to go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice light wind . " Dennis Swale glanced out the window and shook his head . " The wind 's too high , " he said . " Thank you for asking her . I 'm sorry she ca n't go . " John Scarlet must have known what Dennis meant , because the Starlets were not fools . " I can handle a boat , " he said . " Certainly , " said Dennis Swale , " but  --  we 're obliged to you for asking . " " John , " said Sue , " I 'm sorry . " " Oh , that 's all right , " said John . " I 'd  --  better be going now . " " I 'll see you out , " said Tom . As Tom closed the door behind them , Sue felt her heart beat faster and her breath was coming fast . It was as though something terrible had happened , though Tom had only closed the door . Her father was looking at her sharply . " Sue , " he said , " will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite all right ; I have nothing against him ,  |p288but  we 're different from the Scarlets . Do you under-stand ? " " Yes , " she said , " I understand . " " Not that the Scarlets are n't all right , " said Dennis Swale , " not that his father is n't admirable . He 's richer than I am , if you want to put it that way . The Scarlets are an old family . They 've been here as long as we have , if you want to look at records , and we 've always known the Scarlets . It is n't exactly that . It 's back-ground . " He made a gesture with his hand , a single , sweeping gesture , but Susan could always remember it because it made a picture . It was the silver on the sideboard and the steaming coffee urn and the mahogany of the side chairs and the tallness of the room , against simple , homely chairs and tables . It was the smoothness of their father 's hand and the precision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was austere , steely beauty standing against plenty . " It 's the way we 're made , " he said . " You 'll see it sometime . " " Yes , " said Susan Swale . " Yes , " said Dennis , " you saw him in this room . You saw him beside Tom . I am glad you saw him here . " " Yes , " said Susan Swale . The door had opened and Tom was back . " Tom , " said Dennis , " did you see him out ? " " Yes , " said Tom . " He 's gone . " " That 's right , " said Dennis Swale . " What is it , Sue ? " For Susan was standing up and suddenly her voice had broken , and she forgot to be afraid.  | " You 're both unkind , " she said . " That 's what you are  --  unkind . You did n't need  --  " " That will do , " said Dennis Swale . " Susan , go upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking down the hall , she heard her father 's voice again . " What 's getting into everybody ? Has the girl gone crazy too ? " Her mother was sitting up in bed , wrapped in blue brocade and lace , with her breakfast tray across her knees . Susan wondered sometime if she would grow to look like her mother , if her hair and her eyes would also take on the dullness of unpolished glass , if her cheeks and her lips would droop into the same thin lines . " Sue , " said her mother , " you 're too young to knot your hair like that . Do n't forget you 're not grown up . " But Susan knew it was not true ; her mother was gazing at her in a cool , unfriendly way , as she might at another , better-looking woman , and Sue was betterlooking ; something told her that . " Has your father had his breakfast ? " " Yes , Mamma . " Her mother sighed and looked down at her hands , white and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother said , " I think your father is a little mad . Did he tell you ? He 's taking all the money he has left to build a ship . " " Yes , Mamma . " " Sue , " her mother said , " please close that window and carry down my tray . Sue , when you get married , mind you find a man who does n't stand for something . Do you know what I mean ? "  | " Yes , Mamma . " " I think , " her mother said , " I think that every one who stands for something is a little mad . Take your father , Sue . He plays his life just as I play solitaire . He makes his rules and follows them . It has nothing to do with life . It is n't living ; it 's playing . " " Yes , Mamma , " said Sue . Sue always remembered what her mother said becauseeverything that happened afterward was exactly like a game which had started in the house that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether they wished or not , according to unwritten rule . The Swales were in it and the Scarlets were in it too , and the Scarlets had their own pride . They were not the forgetting kind . She and Tom were walking down a rutted road that afternoon , leading from the pastures toward the marshes in back of the Parlin Farm . Tom 's two English setters were quartering before them through the grass , and she could turn her head and see the town , standing by the river . The wind was blowing fresh from the open water , making the air as clear and bright as though there had been a rain , and she could see the Swale house on the high ground , with all the other houses rising toward it . Though it was a long way off , the line of it was clear , and the distance made it seem perfect and unobtainable , not like their house at all . Tom was walking with his quick , nervous step , kickingat the tufts of grass . " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's no use snapping at the old man like that . "  | " I do n't care , " cried Sue . " You were nasty . Both of you . You had n't any right  --  " " No right ? " said Tom . " Are you crazy ? You ca n't go out with Scarlet , and he should have had the sense to know it . It is n't  --  do n't you see ? " " Hush ! " said Sue , and she caught her breath . " Here 's John Scarlet now . " He was coming toward them , walking down the lane with a heavy step , but when he saw them he stopped , though he was a long way off . He stopped and waited while they came walking toward him . " I 've been waiting for you , " John Scarlet said . " Tell your sister to go home . " " I wo n't , " said Sue . " John , what are you going to do ? " She had never seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Scarlet 's heavy face . " I 'm going to lick your brother , if you want to know , " John Scarlet said . " You go back , Sue , if you do n't want to see it . So , I 'm not good enough to take your sister out ? Take off your coat , Tom Swale . " Beside John Scarlet , Tom looked very slim as he took off his coat . " Sue , hold the dogs , " he said . " You might have picked some other time . " " I watched you in the hall , " John Scarlet said . " I 'll show you , Tom . " And then Tom Swale began to laugh , with his coat still dangling on his arm , and Sue remembered that she could hear the waves across the marshes beating on the outer beach . " John , " Tom Swale began , " wo n't you listen to me first ? "  |p292It  must have been the laughter which made John Scarlet blind , for he struck Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jaw . He struck Tom so that his body crumpled forward , and Tom lay on the grass flat upon his face ; and then John was standing , looking at Tom stupidly , wide-eyed and open-mouthed . It all had happened so quickly that Sue could not believe it . First Tom Swale was laughing , and then he was on his face , clutching at the grass . Next a strange thing happened . Before she could move a step , John Scarlet was on his knees , lifting up Tom Swale . " Tom , " he was saying , " I did n't mean to hit you then . You laughed ; it made me mad . " John Scarlet placed his arm behind Tom 's back and pulled him up , while Sue stood staring at them without the power to move . There was something immense about the scene which held her in a spell , for somehow the whole town was in it and hundreds of unspokenmatters . She could always remember their two faces close together , John Scarlet 's heavy with pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindly face  --  and Tom 's was like a marble mask . In that moment the blood and life was out of it , leaving only a delicacy and peace . " Sue , " John Scarlet said , " so help me , I did n't mean to hit him then . The way he laughed , the way he laughed . " Then Sue heard herself speaking in a hushed , strange voice . " He always laughs like that . "  | " Yes , " John Scarlet said , " he 's always laughed like that at me . Tom , I did n't mean to hit you . Tom , are you all right ? " The fixed , staring look had left Tom 's eyes . He shook his head and blinked and struggled to his feet . " I never had a chance , " said Tom . " Are n't you ready to go on ? " " No , " John Scarlet said , " I ca n't fight now . " Tom stepped toward him unsteadily and then he stopped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , " said John Scarlet , " I mean I wo n't . Tom , I wish that I was dead . " Tom brushed the dirt from his shirt and Sue could see his hands were trembling . " All right , " he said . " Later will be better . I 'll see you later . But , no matter what happens , it wo n't make any difference . " " Yes , " said John Scarlet . " Yes , I see . " He was looking at them both in a puzzled way , as though he had never known them . " John , " Sue Swale spoke suddenly because the spell had left her . " You must n't fight again . " " No , " said John , " I wo n't . It wo n't do any good . " " Oh , yes , you will , " Tom Swale said . " We 've got to finish this . " But John Scarlet must have seen that there was something hopeless , because he shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it wo n't finish , ever . " Tom put on his coat and nodded . It was the strangest thing , Sue could remember , that she was sorry for John Scarlet . His strength had broken on something hard ,  |p294where  strength could be no help . The hardness of her father was in Tom Swale , though he had not struck a blow . " Come , " he said , " let 's be going , Sue . I 'll see you later , John . " As they walked on up the road , Sue looked back once and there was John Scarlet standing in the grass , with drooping shoulders and listless hands , staring at their backs . But Tom Swale did not look . She glanced at him timidly , afraid to speak . All his thoughts were struggling , narrowing his eyes , twitching at the corners of his mouth . " We ca n't leave off like this , " he said . " Sue , do n't tell the old man , will you ? I 'd hate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , " said Sue . But her father guessed it , because her father 's eyes were sharp and Tom 's face was red and swollen . He was sitting in the library looking at his paper when he heard them in the hall . " Come in here . Is that you , Tom ? " he asked . There always seemed to be a dusk in the library , even when the lamp was lit ; the rows of old leather books were sinking backward into shadows which the lamplightnever reached . The portraits on the wall were all in shadow , and her father , Sue remembered , seemed half shadow , as he sat in his leather armchair , staring at them both . " Tom , what 's the matter with your face ? " " Nothing , " said Tom . " You 've been fighting Scarlet . That 's the matter , " answered Dennis Swale . Sue remembered that she felt no surprise ; it was asp295though the shadows in the room had told him . And then the bell of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open window in slow , strong waves . Sue loved to hear the sound ; it always brought her back to lonely nights when she was very little . " Swale , " the church bell seemed to say , " Swale , Swale , Swale . " " Yes , " said Tom , " we started fighting but I have n't finished yet . " " And do n't you finish . " There was a loud rattling sound ; her father had crushed the evening paper in his hands . " He 's too big for you . Do you understand ? Do you think I want you killed ? " Tom walked to the table and lighted a cigarette ; the flame of the match struck him exactly as the lamplight struck his father 's face , and once again they were just alike , long-nosed , thin-lipped , staring at each other from the shadows . " Mind you , " said Dennis Swale . " I 'll tell you when you have to fight . " " What 's the news ? " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the dark ; then she saw his shoulders stiffen , as though he saw something coming toward him from the corner of the room . " It looks like war , " he said . " Of course it does , " said Tom . " We 'll get in it some-time . " Then Dennis Swale was staring at the carpet . " But you wo n't go , " he said . " Mind you  --  I can stop you . Tom , the carpet 's old . I want you to get a new one whenp296I 'm gone . And I want you to paint the stairs and have the elm cut down . " " Yes , sir , " said Tom Swale . That was nearly a year before the war , but the thought was with him always that Tom Swale was going to die . Any one can tell you about war time at Haven 's End ; it was a fine time in a way , because the town was all awake . There seemed to be echoes from all sorts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haven 's End had grown rich when there was fighting . It had always been a matter of shipping and , though the open sea seemed very far away , the ships were coming back . Any one can tell you how it was , once the yards were going ; men were coming from the back country ; the stores were lighted long after dark each night . Sue could remember walking with her father down the street in Nineteen Seventeen while every one stood watching . " That 's him , " she heard them say . " That 's Swale ; he 's the one who owns the yard . " The windows of the house in those days were always full of light . There were strange men coming from the city ; the telephone was always ringing . She remembered what her father said one night , because it showed what he had been thinking all the time . " They thought I was crazy , " he said . " And now you can sell anything that floats . It 's always that way in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money in ,  |p297when  he built this house . There 'll be money for you , Tom , before this thing 's through . " He was doing it all for Tom , but he must have known that something was moving nearer , the faster the yards were growing . She could tell by the way he looked at Tom , half startled , as though he had been afraid that Tom would not be there . The thing that Sue remembered was that hammering and the shrieking sound of saws , rising harshly like the sea-birds ' cries , and the smell of fresh wood by the river . The smell of wood and all the sounds blended curiously together , making thoughts rise in a sudden , great , formless shape . There would be the yard by the river , surrounded by old warehouses with blank , broken windows , gray with their rotting shingles and clapboards , staring at the open water where the wharves once stood . But the shipyard was all new ; the wood was so fresh that it was hardly seasoned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swale house stood , and then there were the elm trees budding in the spring , and the tower of the old First Church above the roofs , with the weathercock upon it almost golden in the sun . Out on the river the waves were dancing , glittering , like diamonds shaken on a deep , blue cloth . It was all like something that had happened long ago , Sue Swale always said , though it was only April , Nineteen Seventeen . Tom Swale was just beside her , looking at the river , and Dennis Swale was standing by himself , listening to the shrieking of the saws , when a voice made Susan turn . It was old Mr. Scarlet , who owned the shoe shop.  |p298He  was walking toward them with a hurried step . He must have seen them from his office window . " Mr. Swale ! " he was calling . " Mr. Swale ! " As Dennis Swale turned around , it always seemed to Susan that he had a startled look ; she sometimes thought that Dennis had known what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet it . Mr. Scarlet took off his brown felt hat . " Good afternoon , Miss Swale , " he said , and Susan felt her face grow hot under Mr. Scarlet 's look . He seemed to be saying just as clearly as though he spoke , " So my son is n't good enough for you ? " " Hullo , " her father said . " What is it , Scarlet ? " " Have you seen the paper ? " Mr. Scarlet said . " No , " said Dennis . " What ? " Mr. Scarlet mopped his forehead ; he looked tired before he spoke . " We 've gone into the war , " he said . " I thought I 'd come to tell you . " Mr. Scarlet had pitched his voice almost to a shout to make it heard above the noise of sawing , but somehow , as he spoke , the noise seemed blotted out . They both must have known what the other thought ,  --  old John Scarlet and Dennis Swale . " Well , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to fight . " " All right , " said Mr. Scarlet , and he looked inquiringlyat Dennis . " There 's no harm in my telling you , is there ? I just came to ask what we were going to do . " Sue saw her father 's forehead gather into little lines , and then his lips moved upward . " Is there any reason , " he asked , " why we should do the same ? "  | " Well , " said Mr. Scarlet . " Now there 's you and me , and we stand for something in this town . We 've got to set an example ; we 've got to do what 's right . " Her father 's scowl made his whole face sharp and narrow , and black as thunder . " Do I understand , " said Dennis Swale , " you 've come here to tell me the right thing to do ? " " Now , Mr. Swale , " said Mr. Scarlet , " there 's no need to get so hot . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all . Now we 've got sons . " " Yes , " said Dennis Swale , " and my son is staying here . This is an essential industry . He 'll have his orders to stay on . " Mr. Scarlet mopped his forehead again . " I know , " he said . " I do n't blame you , but I ask you , is it right ? Should n't we be examples , Mr. Swale ? " " Damnation ! " shouted Dennis Swale , and the blackness in his face leaped into his speech . " What are you here to preach at me for ? I 've only got one son . " Mr. Scarlet thrust out his jaw and stepped towards Dennis Swale . " I guess my son 's as good as yours , " he said . " You may not think so , but he means as much to me . " " Scarlet , " said Dennis Swale , and his voice was shaking , " if you want to kill him , go ahead . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at Tom Swale , as though the same thought had impelled them . Tom did not appear to have heard the talk . He was looking at the river where the gulls were circling by the harbor buoys , and , somehow , he seemed light and unsub/stantial . Something in his slimness , something in the way he looked , made Susan Swale afraid . " You mean , " John Scarlet 's voice grew louder , " you mean you 'll make a slacker of him ? Is that right , Mr. Swale ? " There was a buzzing from the saw , like a sound of tearing cloth ; it seemed to be tearing at Dennis Swale , for his lips moved with the sound . " Damn your impertinence ! " he shouted . " What right have you got to libel me ? Now wait a minute . Do n't you speak . I 'm not afraid of what you think or of what anybody thinks . My son 's more useful here than dying in a ditch . And he 'll stay here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swale and mopped his forehead again . " My boy 's as good as he is , " he said . " John 's worth three of him . " Then Sue felt a hand upon her arm ; it was Tom and he had heard . " Let 's get out of here , " he said . " Did you see the look on the old man 's face ? Sue , the old man 's afraid . " " But , Tom , " said Sue , " where are you going ? What are you going to do ? " " Be quiet , " said Tom . " I know what . You 've buried me already , but I 'm not dead yet . " Then Tom walked on in silence , until they were at the foot of the main street , which ended in the cobbled square , where the town well and the whipping post once stood . " I 'll go alone , " said Tom . " I 'll see you later , Sue . " Old brick rows of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that square . Though they had been converted into shops with new plate-glass windows , you could always feel that the present and the past were clashing , and the present seemed unstable , not the past . In front of the ShoeShineParlor a group of men were gathered , and Tom Swale was walking toward them , straight across the street . As Sue stood watching , her heart gave a sudden leap . John Scarlet was standing by the Shoe-Shine Parlor in that group of men , and they were already speaking , and Tom must have seen him first . " Hi , Tom ! " some one said . And then an older man was saying , " Good evening , Mr. Swale . " Tom nodded and walked toward them with his quick , nervous step . " Who 's got a drum ? " he said . " John Scarlet , can you beat a drum ? " " What do you want a drum for ? " Sue heard John Scarlet asking , in his deep , singsong voice . " Because there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tom ? " she heard John Scarlet 's voice . " What do you want a drum for ? " " Because we 're going , " she heard her brother saying . " Come on . Who is n't going to wait until he 's drafted ? Who 's going to this war ? "  |p305OSSIP  STILL KEEPS RUNNING SOFTLYin our town , like the tide about the pilings ofthe old wharves on a misty summer night , and it has that importance of trivial affairs in a lonely place , where continuity stretches back and back into matters which should have been forgotten . Now , just a little while ago , every one knew Johnny Scarlet was sweet on Susan Swale , when he got back from France , except old Dennis Swale . Every one knew Sue and Johnny Scarlet met by the river 's edge at dusk , but no one dared tell old Dennis that . Johnny Scarlet was a good boy , and the Swale house was growing slovenly and its drive was full of weeds , but any one could tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going with a Swale . They could tell you that it was n't right , if they could n't tell you why . " Lookit , " some one used to whisper . " Here they come ! " There they would come walking down the street ,  |p306John  Scarlet 's broad shoulders moving easily with his shortened stride , his red face heavy and serious and plebeian , like all the Scarlets ' faces ; and Sue Swale would be beside him with slender waist and slender hands . Beside John Scarlet any one could see the delicacy and breeding of three hundred years of Swales . Her face seemed molded by adroit , painstaking hands into a still perfection . No Scarlet ever had that half smile on his lips ; no Scarlet 's eyes would ever have her level , careless glance as she looked straight before her and spoke in a low , clear voice . Somehow one could tell that he had never touched her , that he always looked at her as he did then . In the narrowness of Haven 's End , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from unseen things , gentle , but forbidding . " You must n't touch , " the whispers said . " A Scarlet must n't touch a Swale . " You could see half the story once you saw those two together . All the pretense of Dennis Swale walked beside them , and all his cold dislike of novelty and change . All the grimness of the Swales seemed to stride beside them in the gentle evening light . " Say , " some one used to whisper , " what would the old man say ? " Jeff Pingree was the one who could tell you about it best , if you cared to hear , because Jeff Pingree was the Swale 's counselor at law . He could go back to the beginning , if you cared to give him time ; to the Swale and Scarlet grants on the first plantation . " Yes , sir , " Jeff Pingree said , and his lanky hands would twitch in odd , eccentric gestures . " It wasn'tp307right , you understand . The Swales and the Scarlets have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been plain , and the Swales were never like that . I hope you understand . " And Jeff would look out his office window to the main street and put his feet upon his desk . Jeff had seen the Scarlets coming up through the heat of the postwar boom ; he had seen the Scarlets buy the corners on the main street and throw the common pasture into house lots ; he had seen the Scarlets change the tavern to catch the motor trade . " Mark my words , " Jeff Pingree used to say . " It was n't right , that 's all . There 's order and there 's precedent , just as there is in law . The Swales are n't what they used to be , because the times have changed . He was the sort who lives in the past . There 's some who do n't keep in step with things as they get older , and all Dennis had to think of was the Swales . He was getting queer  --  but it made you sort of sorry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , because the queerness of old Dennis was like the eccentricity of our town , withdrawninto its past , now that it was small . There was an illusion of old greatness and a spurious importance in half-forgotten things . Once you heard old Dennis turning over reminiscences about this and that , in those days when he grew garrulous , you could believe the Swales were great , if only from the certainty of the old man 's belief . There was a contagion in it , like the wind from the marshes ; and , curiously , the obsession of Dennis Swale struck to the root of living matters and all the little struggles of our town became immense ,  |p308though  the Scarlets were real and the Swales were makebelieve . Leaning back with the tips of his fingers together , as though he were dealing with a matter of great importance , Jeff could trace the controversy of the Scarlets and the Swales . There was the trolley line upon the main street , and who said this and who said that , and the permit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the motor traffic through the street along the ridge , and the cutting of the big elm , down on India Lane . Yet all those little details would rise and take a shape , and make a cloudy picture of two contending wills , until those details made a world , like a greater world outside , and Haven 's End became an amazing place , exactly like a world . " Yes , sir , " Jeff Pingree used to say , " it would have been different , if it was n't Dennis Swale . His mind was set about the Scarlets  --  set , you understand ; and what with Dennis thinking . . . Some one had to tell him . I was the one who told . " It happened in Jeff 's office up one flight of stairs to the south of Water Square . Dennis Swale , with his close-cropped white hair , stout about the waist but thin in the face , with a sinking look to his cheeks and a thinness to his hands , was seated stiffly , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set like plaster with all sorts of little lines around it  --  the thin , tight mouth of all the Swales . It was after five in the afternoon and the sun was coming through the dusty windows of Jeff Pingree 's office . On the shelves by the wall above the Acts of the General Court were six record boxes marked D. Swale Estate , and throughp309the dirty window the whole length of the street was visible , beginning with the Shoe-Shine Parlor and the stores , up to the brick walks to the Penny Bank , and thence to the head of the street where the Swale house stood . " I tell you they wo n't get it , " Dennis Swale was saying . " They want the motor traffic past my house so it 'll pass their inn . They do n't care about anything as long as they make money . That 's what it always is with them , but they wo n't get it  --  do you hear ? " " Now , Dennis , " Jeff Pingree said , " you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scarlets want it  --  " " Confound ' em ! " shouted Dennis Swale . " They want the automobiles past my house  --  do you understand ? Past my house . It 's the young one . He 's worse than all the rest , but the whole tribe 's just the same . Have you ever seen them do a decent thing ? Cheap as dirt  --  everything here 's cheap now . I tell you they want a roaring motor highway through the center of this town so they can make money . They want it past my house . And  --  do you think I 'll stand for that ? " " Wait a minute , " Jeff Pingree said , " have you spoken to Johnny Scarlet ? Maybe if you spoke to him , perhaps he 'd change his mind . " " Have you lost your head ? " said Dennis Swale . " Do you think I 'll ask favors of the Scarlets ? " " Wait a minute , " Jeff Pingree said . Dennis turned toward him quickly , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes were suddenly narrow . " There 's something I want to tell you . It 's worse than any road  --  and everybody knows it , Dennis , or else I would n't say  --  "  |p310Dennis  Swale was leaning forward , listening . Jeff could hear the old repeater watch ticking in his waistcoat , and it seemed as though all of Haven 's End were changing . " Dennis , " Jeff Pingree said , " Sue 's sweet on Johnny Scarlet . Being your only child , I think you ought to know . " Dennis did not move ; his very immobility was startling , because it spoke of all the things which he might do . " Pingree , " said Dennis Swale , " How do you know that ? " " Look out the window , " Jeff Pingree said . " They 're walking down the street . " Dennis Swale rose slowly and leaned on Jeff Pingree 's desk as he stared through the dusky glass , and sure enough , they were walking down the street . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could imagine all the other Swales and Scarlets walking down the street behind Johnny Scarlet and Susan Swale ; and Dennis must have seen them too . " Open that window , " he said . Jeff Pingree turned and stared at him . Dennis had not raised his voice , but it was not like Dennis ' voice that spoke . " Open up that window , " said Dennis Swale . " I want to speak to Sue . " Jeff Pingree gave the sash a jerk . And then it went creaking upward and a gust of wind blew at the papers on the desk and sent them rattling on the floor . " Sue , " called Dennis Swale , " come up here for a minute . "  | " Say , " said Jeff Pingree quickly , " that 's no way to do . Do n't talk to her like that . " " Sue , " called Dennis Swale , " come up here for a minute . " Sue Swale must have known what was coming , because her lips were shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a silk dress with flowers on it . The wind from the open window blew it softly so that it seemed like the drapery on a statue . It blew against her brown silk stockings and blew against her hair . " Sit down , " said Dennis Swale . " You might as well have nothing on as that confounded dress . " " Might I ? " said Sue Swale . " Did you want to tell me that ? " " Now here , " said Jeff Pingree , " it 's just the way things are . It is n't Sue 's fault she 's good to look at . " Sue turned toward him and smiled , and there was no doubt that she was good to look at then . She was above all coldness , warm and gay with a secret knowledge , once she smiled . Dennis leaned forward . He had never taken his eyes from her once the office door had closed . All his days were hard upon him , little , narrow days . All his face spoke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that . There was a strength in the very smallness of his thoughts , as though his will had been tempered by undeviating years , until it was a blind and arrogant faith . The fire of a belief was burning in him , hot beneath the coldness of his cheeks . " You 're too good-looking , " said Dennis . " You get that from your mother 's side . I saw you out the win-dow. "  |p312Then  there was a faint pink in her cheeks , exactly like the pink in Dennis ' face . " Say , " said Jeff Pingree , " maybe I 'd better be going . " " No , " said Dennis , " no , you do n't . Sue , I saw you with John Scarlet . Is there anything between him and you ? " Jeff was used to faces changing when questions were asked sharply . The light from a flame seemed to flicker across her face , but she did not turn her head away . Dennis Swale hitched forward in his chair . " You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between you and Scarlet , Sue ? " " Nothing , " she said . " Why should there be ? What 's the matter , Father ? " Her voice made Jeff turn quickly . Dennis ' cheeks had grown brick-red and his eyes were glazed and staring . " Father , " cried Sue Swale . " What 's the matter , Father ? Do n't you "  --  suddenly her voice had broken  --  " do n't you know I love you ? I would n't hurt you , dear . " " Pingree , " said Dennis Swale  --  his voice was hoarse and thick  --  " get me a glass of water . You lied then , Sue . I saw it in your face . " " Do n't ! " cried Sue . " Father , please do n't look like that ! " " Give me that water , " said Dennis Swale . Then Jeff Pingree remembered that his own glance met Susan Swale 's . Though they did not speak , they might as well have spoken , because her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It would kill him ! " she was saying , just as plainly as though she had spoken , and they both had seen it , Jeff and Sue . It had been there for a moment in that room ; for a moment among the voices and sounds from the street outside , the shadow of Death had been beside them , touching Dennis Swale . And again her eyes were speaking , deep and dark against the stillness of her face . " It would kill him , " they were saying . " It would kill him , if he knew ! " Dennis leaned his head against the wall , and the ugly red was draining from his cheeks , leaving them sickly . It was the first time that Jeff Pingree had seen him look so old . " Father , " Sue was saying , " why do you hate him so ? " And when old Dennis answered , everything he said was true . At first his words came slowly . " Are you listening to me , Sue ? When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape . They are not cloudy to me the way they are to you . They get etched out in your mind . They wake you up at night when you get old . They touch you with their hands . It 's an idea  --  do you understand me ?  --  not a person that I dislike . Do n't think I have n't eyes . This town is changing . Is that any reason I should change ? We 've stood for something here that 's sinkingdown . Once we were Haven 's End , and it 's the Scarlets now . They are changing it to suit themselves . I 've seen them put their hands on everything . Do you think I want a Scarlet walking in my hall and looking at my portraits ? "  | " Father ! " cried Sue . " Do n't get so excited ! Father , please  --  there 's nothing  --  " " Yes , " old Dennis said , " you think that it is nothing . Is it nothing to try to be what we used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the name of Swale turning into Scarlet ? " " Here now , " Jeff Pingree said . " Dennis , it do n't do any good  --  " " Do n't you stop me , Pingree , " old Dennis said . " I 've got a right to speak , if it 's the last thing I ever say , and I wish it was the last , with a Scarlet reaching for my house . Are you listening , Sue ? You say it 's nothing . Your mother says it 's nothing . Dennis , ' she said this morning , you 're living on illusion . Who are you , Dennis Swale ? ' Well , an old fool ca n't change . Are you listening to me ? " " Yes , " said Sue , " I 'm listening . Father  --  please  --  " Dennis pulled himself out of his chair , and leaned on his gold-headed cane . " Then listen to this , " he said . " I want your promise . You 're through with Scarlet , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't have it , do you hear me ? I 've got other plans . " She must have seen death on him , just as Jeff Pingreesaw . There was a silence broken by Dennis ' heavy breathing . " Do n't look like that ! " cried Sue . " Did you hear me ? Do you promise ? " shouted DennisSwale . " Yes , " said Sue , " I promise . Please do n't look like that . " Dennis squared his shoulders and sat down.  | " Good , " he said . " You wo n't break your word . I thought you 'd understand . " Jeff Pingree remembered that he was frightened . Once the thing was over , he could see it all more clearly . He had bent her to his will as though he had laid his hands upon her . He had played upon her sympathy and her habit of obedience without a thought . " Sue , " said Dennis , " they say I 'm hard , and I suppose I am , when I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swale house after I am gone . " Dennis cleared his throat and tapped his cane upon the floor . He had no idea that his wish was fantastic , because it was too much a part of all his eccentricity . " I 've been thinking , " said Dennis . " There is n't much left for me now but thought . There 's a connection of ours , an Arthur Swale living in New York . I 've taken the liberty of writing him  --  " " Do you know him ? " asked Sue Swale . " I 've taken the liberty of writing him , " said Dennis , " asking his son to visit us . He may be here any time . " " Any time ? " asked Sue with a strange note in her voice . " Yes , any time , " answered old Dennis . " There 's one thing , " said Sue Swale . " When I promised , I did n't say  --  " And then her face turned red . A heavy step was on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing in the doorway , holding his new straw hat . He looked at Dennis Swale and smiled , though he must have known what Dennis thought . Beneath the eyes of Dennis Swale his ease was falling from him , as it always did . His heavy fingers moved **31;1910;TOOLONG by chuckling mysteriously and interrupting with the assertion that she for one was convinced that he was the Lost Dauphin . The other two daughters of the Colonel , Greataunt Esther and Greataunt Susan , both married building contractors who had come into the new country to make their fortunes . Neither of them made a fortune . Indeed , talent and even desire for making money never appeared in any member of Johnny 's family nor in any of those who had married into it . In none of them was there either shrewdnessor its more sordid twin , thrift . If any of them came into money it was spent at once , as if having it in hand made them uneasy . With all of theta living well was a necessity , and it was always possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich country where there were not too many people . Yet comfort bordering on luxury constantly devoured income and earnings . The greatuncles and great aunts had a good time in life , all save perhaps Greataunt Jane , who was the richest of the lot . Greataunt Susan was a small woman very like Johnny 's grandmother , and the nearest to her in affection of all the sisters . She alone of them all could ever have been called thrifty , but I think she was moved less by actual thrift than by the fact that the idea of thrift gave her an excuse to keep all sorts of budgets and ledgers and diaries . She had a passion for detail and for writing down the purchase of a spool of thread or a quart of peas . In the end , despite all the paraphernalia , she appeared to have made no economies and died no richer than the others , save that she . left behind piles of ledgers and account-books . It may have been that she found satisfaction in knowing where her money went . She and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding , and went olf to live in the northern part of the State ; but absence and matrimony made no difference to them in the attractions for the Farm and the hospitality of the Colonel , and they were forever returning on long visits , making the long journey partly by train , partly by coach , and sometimes , in a pinch , even on horseback . Both husbands died before Johnny was born and theyp101left behind them no legend . I think they must have been dull feb lows and that their dullness was the reason for the long visits made by Susan and Esther in the gayer atmosphere of the Farm and the more worldly one of Trefusis Castle . Both men were employers , but they knew their business thoroughly , and if workmen failed them they were able to build a well or construct a whole house with their own hands . The family saw very little of them and thought of them as indistinguishable . Usually they were referred to as a pair , like a music-hall team . The family always spoke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three great aunts preserved until the end of their lives an intense intimacy , constantly visiting one another , criticizing one another 's households , and suggesting reforms in the upbringing of one another 's children and the discipline of one another 's husbands . And in those days visits were not made with an overnight bag . They were accompanied by large trunks of tin or cowhide and they lasted for weeks and sometimes for months . The Colonel 's daughters were powerful women , and all save Maria long survived their husbands . There were times when beyond all doubt their intimacy and their passionate interest in one another 's affairs became too intense to be borne , and then there followed bickerings and scenes and hurt feelings and sudden departures in a flurry , followed by the most complicated intrigues in which each sought to win the support of the other sisters . And then quite suddenlythere would be a dramatic reconciliation with tears and emotion , and the little comedy would begin all over again . There was in their blood a strange hankering for the dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke out in the most absurd quarrels . Life never seemed passionate or dramatic enough to satisfy them . When Johnny was a child and they were old ladies , in little black bonnets and spriggled black and purple dresses , the drama still continued endlessly . Johnny 's mother was their favorite niece and one of them was forever calling to enlist her sympathy against the others . Johnny 's grandmother was the least dramatic of the three ,  |p102|perha|ps  because she found enough drama in the responsibilities of her great family and husband and the care of the garden and kitchen , and so she suffered appeals from them all and became the center of their intrigues . As far back as Johnny could remember , Greataunt Esther  --  the Mrs. Widcome who had upset Jamie on his first visit  --  was blind from cataract ; but despite her blindness she was the jolliest of the three . Like her brother Jacob , she had a quality of puckish mischief . Her face was rather broad , with an expression of great brightness and charm , and out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her old-fashioned false teeth she regarded as an indignity , for , even blind , she was vain of her appearance . They were constantly displayingthemselves in a double row of tombstones when she laughed . She was a master gossip with a novelist 's sense of a good story and a rich streak of humorous malice and mockery , and if she found one or two scraps of good scandal she did not hesitate to reconstruct the missing parts , either motives or actions or results or all three , embroidering the whole tale with a lavish imagination and a sense of the classic unities . Her gossip usually lacked an air of authenticity because it was too good and too artistically complete . More than once when one of her sisters trapped her in a falsehood concocted for the sake of art , she laughed and , admitting her embroidery , said , " Well , it might have happened that way , " or , " Well , it ought to have been like that . " She was no realist and had a romantic 's proper scorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tragedy of her life ( her husband and children all died before her , leaving her blind and alone in the world ) bore in the end a philosophy which consoled her . Certainly she possessed the detachment without which no philosophercan exist . Shut in behind her blindness , she regarded the world , her sisters , perhaps even her own husband and children and herself , as parts of a spectacle . But she was a mischievous philosopher , and now , looking hack upon the memory of her sprightly figure , I think that she may have been quietly the instigator of most of those dramas which perpetually disturbed and embellishedp103the lives of the sisters . I suspect that she sat back and enjoyed them more than any of the others . In her old age she shared a house with her widowed sister Susan ( an idea of the mock-thrifty Susan , who saw an added pleasure in keeping ledgers and budgets and diaries for two rather than one ) , and I think that she sometimes tormented the slower-witted sister , for now and then one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baggage and sometimes a bird or two , would suddenly arrive to stop for an indefinite period , with one of the other sisters or with Johnny 's mother . The visit was always accompanied by the public announcement that either Esther or Susan , according to the identity of the visitor , had become insufferable , and that the visitor was only remaining until she could arrange to set up an independent establishment . Always in the end there was a reconciliation and the two aunts settled down together once more until there was a new explosion . It went on indefinitely and I fancy that they became so charmed by the drama and so accustomed to it that it was impossible to do without it . Greataunt Susan died first and Greataunt Esther followed her within four months . The visits of the blind Greataunt Esther were always welcome . She had a sense of fun which children appreciated and she could play the piano and had an endless number of stories about her childhoodand the Indians who at that time still escaped from reservations and wandered across the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their morals and traditions gone the way of their hunting-ground . Now and then they set upon some lonely farmer and tomahawked the whole family . That much is history , but most of Greataunt Esther 's stories were , I am afraid , gravely apocalyptic , though none the less exciting . She did , however , remember well that strange figure of Western Reserve history known as Johnny Appleseed . He existed . He was no invention of Greataunt Esther . He lives in the traditions of the whole Western Reserve  --  a voice crying in the wilderness , unkempt , unshorn , and unwashed , a demented fellow who in the Palestine of two thousand years ago would have been honored as a prophet.  |p104Like  John the Baptist , he lived on locusts and wild honey , clothed in the skins of wild animals and bits of cast-off clothing . He wandered from settlement to settlement and cabin to cabin , preachingand singing , never staying more than a night . Winter and summer were alike to him . Ile gained his name from his habit of planting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by streams and on the edge of virgin forests , the seeds of apples which settlers had brought from the East . When the trees they brought with them began to bear , he begged for the seeds of their first fruit , and the Colonel and his family used , half-humorously , to save the seeds of the apples they ate in the long winter evenings and put them into a paler bag to give to Johnny Appleseed when he came in one night at sunset to sleep in the mows of the great barn . Wherever he went he planted , too , the fennel , esteemed as a cure for the fever and ague which rose to attack the settlers ' families when their plows turned for the first time the rich black virgin loam of all that fertile country . His whole existence was a fabric of delusions , and among them was the belief that he had befriended the king of France , Louis XVII , the child of Marie Antoinette . For his life had crossed now and then the path of another life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up among the Indians and known only as Lazare . The younger man was handsome , too handsome , indeed , ever to have been a Bourbon , and no one knew anything of his origin save that he had been left among the Indians as a scatterwittedchild of ten or twelve . In the simple life among the Indians he had recovered his wits and remembered a little of his early life , such details as vast gardens and big mirrored rooms and mobs with torches . In Canada and in the Western Reserve he became famous as the Lost Dauphin , and a committee of Royalists came all the way from England to see him , but the Duchesse d'Angouleme and Louis Philippe ( perhaps for good reasons of his own ) repudiated him , and at last he disappeared again into the world of Indians and trappers with an apathy and a talent for obscurity which were perhaps a better claim to Bourbon blood than all the nightmare memories ofp105his childhood . But for a time he was a romantic figure , and there were certainly many strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was shut up to die in die Temple . SometimesJohnny Appleseed and the Dauphin wandered through the Western Reserve together , a strange , incongruous couple , living peacefully with Indians or whites , sleeping at night in the open or in the mows of a barn . Johnny 's Greataunt Esther always said that she had seen the Lost Dauphin , but I think that was one of her stories , for he vanished into obscurity soon after she was born . But true or not , her story was a good one . She made him a handsome , glamorous figure , a lost romantic prince , and although she began in mockery she came in the end to believe , like many others of her day , that he was the Lost Dauphin , cheated of his inheritance by the son of the wily Egalite . A hundred years have passed since Lazare vanished into obscurity , but no one has ever proven that Greataunt Esther was wrong . He may have been the Dauphin . No doubt she believed that he should have been for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lay down one night to sleep in a thicket and never wakened again . He was , in his way , the prophet of the New Country . He preached always that it was the promised land and that one day would be the richest spot on God 's green earth . He was vindicated , but centuries sooner than he had believed . His legend lingered after him , and in one of the pretty parks of the Town there is a little obelisk raised to his memory . But there are other monuments , too , for in the hedgerows here and there all over Ohio and Indiana there still linger ancient apple trees , old , rotten , worm-eaten , hollowed by flickers and woodpeckers , sometimes blackened by the smoke of factories , grown from the seeds thrust into the rich earth more than a century ago by Johnny 's crazy hand . And on hot summer days when one can see the corn pushing its tall tassels upward , the smell of fennel is everywhere . The two great centers of family hospitality were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rugsP106and pictures and statuary her husband had collected in the East or in Europe during the middle of the nineteenth century . Christmas dinner was always held at the Farm , and New Year 's dinner at Trefusis Castle . It is difficult to imagine two houses more different , the one rambling and of an architecture without style or any charm save that subtle but powerful one acquired by houses which have grown without forethought , out of necessity ; the other was pretentiousand constructed in the oddest of styles . At the Farm the furniture was worn and shabby and nondescript and placed where it was most useful and convenient . It was always being moved about from room to room , according to the demands of necessity . In Trefusis Castle there was an immense long drawing-room , a small drawing-room , a vast hall , a sun parlor , and a library . In the drawing-room each piece of furniture had its place . At the tall Gothic windows , ornamented by little inset panes of blue and red glass , there were enormous curtains of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gilt cord . In the gardens and the surroundings there was , too , a difference . At the Farm , Maria 's flowers merged almost imperceptibly into the big vegetable garden , and here and there in the lawn grew clumps of flowering shrubs . At Trefusis Castle , one entered through a gateway of wrought-iron and gilt , to approach the red brick house with its ornate roof-line and Gothic windows and big chimneys , by an avenue of clipped Norway spruce with niches cut into it to shelter classic statues made of cast iron and washed each spring with white lime . There were avenues and trellises , and behind the house , the big stables grown over with wistaria and ampelopsis . Everything was pruned and clipped and formal . Both places had a fascination and a charm , the one real and earthy and human , the other romantic and literary and in its gloom a little Gothic . The Farm Johnny loved as a child . Trefusis Castle he did not love , but it fascinated him because he felt that the great world outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , must be like this ; and when he went there to spend the day amid the strange hodge-podge of beautiful and ugly things  --  the thingsp107of the eighteenth and early nineteenth century all mixed up with the heavy horrors of the mid-nineteenth -- he used to pretend to himselfsecretly that all the uncles and aunts and cousins were persons of fashion and distinction and importance . Long afterward he discovered that such persons were not very different and frequently enough less interesting than those who sat in the big dining-room hung with pictures of birds and fish at Trefusis Castle . There was no gaiety in Greataunt Jane 's big house . There were mountains of food , a wonderful Swiss music-box that played twenty tunes , and the stables with the nigger boys , and among the six daughters there was one , years older than Johnny , who had as much charm as any woman he ever encountered . She was a beautiful , willful girl with the most gracious manners , and she had ideas of the independence of women far beyond her time and generation . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died he had left her rich in her own right , and from that day she led her own life , spending years in Europe and even going alone to the Orient . In those days her behavior created a scandal in the Town , but I fancy she never gave the disapproval of the Town much thought . She led rather the life of a man . She had both the recklessness of her father , the Doctor , and the pride and independence of her mother , Greataunt Jane . She came to no bad end and late in life she married an Englishman and settled down to being the best of wives and the happiest . Sometimes she was in Europe on the occasion of the great New Year 's dinners , and sometimes she was present , and her presence made the most enormous difference . I think that all through his childhood Johnny was in love with her , not alone because she was charming and beautiful and kind , but also because she knew what the great world was like . She had been everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room changed . The conversation grew more lively and Greataunt Jane 's temper grew better . Johnny , watching her , grew fascinated , tongue-tied , and silent , and when she spoke to him he blushed and could think of nothing to say , and he never knew that when she was an old woman he would still , in his deepestp108heart , be aware of her charm and good nature and poise and her soft voice as a standard by which to measure all other women . When she was absent the New Year 's dinner was inclined to be a pompous affair , with much citing in silence and a long period of coma after dinner in the drawing room . Of the other daughters , one suffered from melancholia , and one early in life acquired a religious mania . It was altogether a strange household in which one felt forever , even long alter the Doctor 's death , his presence and the sinister shadow of the unhappiness of Greataunt Jane 's marriage . I think that the greatest tragedy lay in the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had only loved her as much as his philandering and reckless nature would allow ; and that was not enough . At last , late in the afternoon after a great hubbub over wraps , the family was packed into sleighs to drive through the winter dusk down the avenue of Norway spruce and through the iron grill into the sordid streets lined with humble houses . For by the time Johnny was old enough to register impressions of the life about him the mills and factories had already come to the marshes and Trefusis Castle and the park around it stood isolated from the respectable part of Town . The railroad passed just beyond the iron fence , and the smoke and soot of scores of chimneys drifted over the garden . All round it were the houses of the mill-workers , abandoned respectable houses belonging to another day , used now as rookeries and falling into ruin , or cheap new dwellings surrounded by patches of yellow clay . Leaving the park , that bleak area always gave Johnny an odd , indescribable sensation of uneasiness and fear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sat embattled side by side . Through the pretentious wrought-iron gateway , the eighteenth century looked out upon the twentieth . Indeed , by the time Johnny was ten years old the new had entirely surrounded the Strawberry IIi11 Gothic house , so that it was in a state of siege . But Greataunt Jane refused to surrender . This was her house and in it she would stay until she died . But the presence of the mills and the sordid houses and the looks of the dark alien faces peering from windows as the sleighs drovep109over the dirty snow did nothing to make the New Year 's day any gayer . Greatuncle Jacob , who married the daughter of the banker , begot nine children by his first wife before she died . She must have been a woman of small personality or perhaps , due to the arrival of nine children in twelve years , she had neither the time nor the energy to assert herself , for no legend of her survived in the family and Johnny never heard her spoken of , so that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greatuncle Jacob had been generated spontaneously . Most of her offspring seemed to have inherited a little of her talent for obscurity . They were sober , earnest , and quiet , good citizens in an inconspicuous fashion , rather like plump birds whose protective coloring made them indistinguishable from their background . But in that great , sprawling family one needed eccentricitiesand extravagance of character in order to be noticed at all , and Uncle Jacob 's children seemed the proper children of a banker 's daughter , conservative and sound and perfectly unexceptional . To Johnny they never quite seemed to belong to his family , and he had to pinch himself and think twice before he recognized Josephine and Andrew , Harry and Margaret , and all the others and their children as his own cousins . They appeared at family funerals and weddings and then retired again into the solid respectable houses which they occupied . Greatuncle Jacob was not only blessed in his first wife by an abundance of children , but by a fortune , as well , which permitted him to live in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stoop near the center of the Town , and to keep horses and continue experimenting with his fantastic inventions . He did not , as the Colonel feared , go over to bankers and the Hamiltonian party after his marriage . Indeed , neither politics nor banking interested him at Al , and after a few years of pretense at working in his **27;1943;TOOLONG he gave it up altogether and abandoned himself simply to the delights of living . Like his blind sister Esther , he took what Jamie , the good citizen ,  |p110considered  " a light view of life . " He had a great deal of the terrifyingMrs . Widcome 's spirit of mockery , but very little of the gall with which it was sometimes mingled . Ile had an airy , fantastic spirit which marked him as the child of the giddy Susan , and an overwhelmingcuriosity and interest in everything in life  --  the weather , his children , the affairs of his neighbors , the stray clog in the street and the color of the eyes of a new-born baby . Despite the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his days were crowded , and no day was ever long enough to encompass all the delights that were to be explored . I lc inherited all the enormous curiosity of the Colonel without any of the Colonel 's capacity for intellectual organization . In its place , lie had the frivolity of his mother Susan , with none of her vanity . Ile had no sense of responsibility , and when his first wife died even turned over his accounts and the housekeeping to the offspring who were still children . Perhaps his own giddiness made them sober , for he always remained more their child than their father . Even them he looked upon , I think , as acts of God for which he was duly thankful to nature for having made the task of begetting them a perfectly pleasant affair . Yet these sober children were far more fortunate in their father than most children , for his faults were charming , human , and comicaland more delightful than the virtues of duller parents . Of all the Colonel 's children , the spirit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mocking , survived purely in him alone . All the others , even Greataunt Jane , were tainted by the sober earnestness of the nineteenth . Yet he was in himself a link with the twentieth , for in the clever , superficial brain were born a half dozen contributions to the age of the machine . If genius follows that dullest of definitions  --  an infinite capacity for taking pains -- then Greatuncle Jacob had none of the quality which characterized earnest and impassioned inventors like Edison . He did not plod . His inventions came as inspirations . And he was no business man . He was invariably swindled out of all the profits  --  for his bicycle brake , his cash-carrier , his primitive elevator , his patent rocker ; yet I think he was entertained even by the intrica/ties of the swindling process of which he himself was the victim . He was , altogether , a horrible example of another adage  --  that money will take care of itself and that the first thing in life is to enjoy it . Fifty years after his death there still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cast iron with which Greatuncle Jacob planned to solve the problem of perpetual motion . It was placed there with the greatest secrecy one summer day before an audience of three  --  old Jamie , Dr. Trefusis , and the inventor himself . Before starting the machine Greatuncle Jacob warned Jamie and the Doctor to select each one a solid oak as protection , for once the machine was started , he warned them , it would go faster and faster until it flew to pieces . Cautiously they peered out from behind their trees while Greatuncle Jacob approached the machine in a gingerly way and set it in motion with a few turns of a crank . Then he too ran for shelter , and while the three men watched , the governor of the machine turned more and more slowly until at last it stopped . Again and again Greatuncle Jacob started it , each time with less caution and more contempt , and again and again it revolved slowly to a dead stop . When at last he felt he had given it a fair trial he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing is a fake ! " Late in life he married a second time , a lady far more sprightly than his first wife . She was large and plain , with great intelligence and cultivation and a Rabelaisian sense of humor ; and Greatuncle Jacob , who never took much notice of the banker 's daughter , could go nowhere without her . They never had any children , but she made a good stepmother to Jacob 's large family , who found her more entertaining than their own mother had ever been . The two of them knew everyone in the County , because there was no one , however ( lull or horrible , who failed to arouse curiosity and interest in the hearts of Jacob and Malvina . Sometimes their speech and their jokes scandalized more sober and respectable members of society , but they had no enemies , and as they grew older most people in the County came to refer to them behind their backs , and with a kindly respect , as " Jacob and Malvina " as if , they , like " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Together in a trap behind two horses they exploredp112the whole County , stopping wherever fancy dictated for dinner , and always they were welcome . He had qualities and a gift for friendship which would have been golden treasure to any politician , but with them went none of the politician 's insincerity nor the suspicions which the antics of the politicians aroused in the hearts of intelligent men and women . Everybody in the County knew tluu Jacob MacDougalhad no ambitions and wanted nothing of than but their friendship and a good tittle . In that sober country and that serious community he was it waster all his life , careless and good-humored and irresponsible , and he should have brought down upon his head the condemnor ion and contempt of the world in which he lived , but somehow he did not . People respected him without quite knowing why . I le was a relief to a dull life where the only other variations for most citizens were camp-meetings and torchlight processions . Among the friends of Jacob and Malvina was a queer old woman with the lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the highroad within sight of the Colonel 's Farm . When Jacob was thirty she was already an old woman . Although she was a spinster and unprotected , she demanded of her nephew on whose land she lived , a home of her own , and he gave her a little house of two rooms where she lived surrounded by goats and rabbits , chickens , , three or four mongrel dogs , and a cow . She had come from Laneashireas a girl and always spoke with a Lancashire accent which to half the County was a foreign tongue . By some of the ignorant and superstitious she was regarded as a witch , but she must have been a very strange witch , for , excepting her appearance , there was nothing in the least sinister about her . On the contrary , she was a clown and had a broad , low sense of humor . In her younger days when doctors were scarce she had beer , a midwife and she knew all sorts of strange remedies for rheumatism and brain fever , congestionand fever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of herbs for the concoction of her brews  --  plants with lovely names like hyssop and rampion , thyme and marjoram . She shared Greatuncle Jacob 's sense of the absurd and thep113ridiculous , and it formed a bond which bound together an old woman and a young man in a preposterous friendship . In her little house she used to sit and watch for the passing of Greatuncle Jacob along the Onara Turnpike on his way to the Farm , and when she saw his wagonette and black horses coming over the distant hills she quickly donned her best clothes , scrambled down the high bank covered with sweet clover , and was waiting by the roadside when he arrived . They had an absurd game , begun by accident , which went on endlessly . Across the sides of the wagonette , behind the driver 's seat , Uncle Jacob placed a fitted board which he used when there were more passengers than the wagonette could hold properly . On this Anne Condon , in her best clothes and bonnet , would seat herself with great dignity , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to follow . Then cracking the whip , Jacob would set off at full speed up the road as if to show her how line his horses were ( he always drove at full speed as if going to a fire ) . The board seat was insecure at best , and with the jolting of the swiftly-moving wagonette it sometimes slipped its fastenings and gave way , depositing Anne Condon in her best clothes unceremoniouslyupon the floor . The game consisted of seeing whether Anne Condon could keep her seat or whether Greatuncle Jacob could succeed by fast driving and seeking the worst places in the road in jolting her to the floor . She always hailed him , whether he was hound toward the Farm or toward the Town . At the Farm she was always welcome , for when she and Jacob arrived together an epidemic of practical jokes broke out at once , jokes which the sober Jamie did his best to appreciate and enjoy . They always knew , on the arrival of Anne Condon , by the state of her clothes and the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game . On the way to the Farm she nearly always lost , for locust roots in the bumpity lane and the planks of the bridge over the brook provided Herculean jolts which Greatuncle Jacob unfairly took at full speed . Usually old Anne arrived at the top of the hill laughing , clinging wildly to the sides of the wagonette , and attempting to adjust her bonnet at the same time . The only visitsp114she ever made , save as an herb doctor and midwife , were to the Farm with Uncle Jacob . She must have been an exceedingly limber old lady , for when she played her rough-and-tumble game she was well past sixty and she never appeared to suffer any ill effects . She swore freely and magnificently with a line vocabulary which came out of eighteenth-century Lancashire . One day Greatuncle Jacob passed the little hut and Anne Condon did not appear . On his way hack to the Town she still did not appear , and outside the door her great mongrel sheep-dog sat on his haunches , his nose in the air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bed . She had died in her sleep . Fifty years later her little house , abandoned since her death , still stood on the high bank covered with sweet clover and rugosa roses . It slowly fell into bits and returned to the earth , for no one ever took the trouble to pull it down . Long afterward , when the Town had become the City and the fields of Job Condon 's farm had been broken up by a real estate allotment , there were still traces of an old garden lost among Weeds and rubbish  --  patches of periwinkle , wild fennel , and here and there an herb , gone wild , and some scraggly roses.  | When Johnny was born the Town was no longer a village and not yet a city . It lay somewhere between in that dishevelled , disorganized period of growth where hovels stood side by side with pretentious new buildings and empty building lots littered with rubbish and weeds spread their desolation beside the newly built palaces of merchants and manufacturers . It was the desolation of a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new arose from the ruins of the old and there was no time for clearing away the debris of progress . The square which Jamie saw when he looked out of the window of the Weiler House in 1852 had gone the way of the log houses set in the clearing in the forest . Where the old brick Court House with its seemly white columns once stood there was a new one , vast , ugly , and monstrous , with a cheap tin cupola surmounted by a figure of Justice , which the Town knew cynically was worth $1o,000 and had cost five hundred thousand . The old trees still filled the center of he square , but in their shade rose a fountain surmounted by the cast-iron figure of a soldier in the uniform of the Union Army . At one corner of the square , opposite the new Court House , stood the old Presbyterian church , long since abandoned , its auditorium occupied by a bustling firm of plumbers , its basement by the Court House saloon . On the third side stood the bright new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the site of Silas Bentham 's " Great Bazaar . Household Goods , Hardware and Miscllany . " The old houses built in the style of Salem or Germantown had long since vanished , and in place of their marble stoops and oriel windows there were rows of shops and banks and the mosquelikestructure which sheltered the Pentland Daily Gazette . The oldp116charm and beauty of the square had gone and the bright newness of a modern square had not yet come to take its place . The whole facade was an odd hodge-podge of architectural styles and building materials , ranging from the sold simplicity of the disemboweled old church to the rantings in stone of the rococo Court House . Farmers still weighed their hay on the scales before the Court House door and the hitching-rails still surrounded the little park . Sometimes in the big space before the Court house a carnival company raised its tents and a high diver regarded the figure of Justice face to face before plunging into the tank below . Lions howled , and once a female leopard tamer was mauled for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lodge . In the middle of one side of the square there was still a building called the Weiler House , the third generation descended from the log cabin in which the Colonel had spent his first night in the new country . It was built of soot-stained yellow brick , with an ugly roof and a facade designed and ornamented in the Byzantine manner with enormous plate-glass windows . The proprietor was the grandsonof the first Weiler , but he was as different from the first innkeeperas the new hotel was different from Weiler 's Tavern . The rooms of the new hotel were uniform as to painting and decoration , and each was equipped with all sorts of modern comforts , which somehow made them less comfortable than the old rooms with their gigantic beds and feather puffs had been . The blankets were dead pancakes , and no longer did the host come to your room at night with a pan filled with coals to warm your bed , and no longer did he pass from table to table in the dining-room to see that the food was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table by impudent waitresses , who removed them without interest or comment if they were left untouched . The Weiler I louse had a poolroom and cigarstoreon one side , and it was the Mecca of traveling salesmen in that part of the State . In the evening they sat on the piazza , smoking cheap cigars and telling dirty stories and making comments on the women who passed along the sidewalks . There was a word for them . " Drummers " were a part of the changing pattern and they fittedp117admirably into the strange , muddled , tasteless facade of the square . They were the small vulgar forerunners of the New Day that was dawning when they would no longer be " drummers , " but highpoweredsalesmen . The time was not far off when they would be . regarded as the heroes of a new crusade whose goal was to sell things to people who did not want them and could never pay for them . No longer did the presence of the farmers dominate the square . Their hay-wagons still stood in line before the Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigs " were still tied at the hitchingrailswhile the women shopped and the men drank beer in the Court House saloon , but they were lost now among the citizens of the Town and among the dark people who came up out of The Flats on Saturday nights to stare in the shop windows . The dark people were strangers and spoke an alien tongue . The men had ferocious black mustachios and sometimes their faces were blackened by soot and smoke . And the women wore dozens of petticoats and on Saturday nights wore bright shawls over their heads . They brought a sinister brightness with them into a country which had never known multiple petticoats and brilliant shawls . They were the first peasants to come into that world , but they no longer tilled the earth ; they worked in the swarming factories and mills which had covered the marshes . The dark people and the " drummers " and the mills were all a part of the New Day . No one in the Town , save Greataunt Jane , any longer spoke of the marshes or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long since been drained and Toby 's Run induced to follow a straight and orderly channel , save in the spring of the year , when it suddenly went wild and flooded the cellars of the old houses in the lower streets , carrying garbage and sewage everywhere . The brook in which the Delaware chief had found a drunken death was now only an open sewer . The marshes had gone and the Flats had taken their place . No longer did Greataunt Jane sit isolated in Trefusis Castle mocking those who speculated in real estate and boomed the Town . In the end they had won and the evidence of their victory layp118all about her . She might have the cast-iron statues whitewashed once a week , but they were still streaked with soot . The trees of the park , suffocated by smoke , had begun to die , and sometimes at Trefusis Castle one did not see the sun until long after noon . In the upper part of the Town , along Elm Street and Maple Avenue , the wooden sidewalks were gone and the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made great tunnels of shade and the Virginia creeper and ampelopsis had climbed to the top of the tall spire on the Congregational church . Near the center of the Town the old New England houses still stood , set bark a little from the street , but the trees were no longer saplings and the lilacs and syringas hid the windows of the first floor . Those houses had a look of having been there forever , and to Johnny it seemed that nothing could possibly be older than their cold , rather grim facades , nothing unless it was Trefusis Castle . And the people who lived in them seemed all to be old women who were widows . Sometimes they came to call on your mother , sometimes you encountered them opening the front gates of their dooryards , solid , respectable , prosperous , clad in durable black or purple , living lives in which there was never any change . They were the daughters and the widows of the first men who came into the new country and prospered . They were the relics of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their generations all the men seemed to die soon after middle age , but the women went on forever . A mile from the square , in a part of the Town which had been open country in the ' seventies stood the only " property " which rivaled in size and splendor the house of Dr. Trefusis . It stood in the middle of a park , with stables and outbuildings and a crescentshapedavenue bordered by buckeye trees . But it had neither quaintnessnor beauty nor charm . It was built during the Grant Administrationand , like it , was uncompromisingly ugly . Johnny 's grandfather and his father always asserted that it was built from the profits made during the looting of New Orleans . How else , they asked , could such a house have been built by a man who began his career a little while before as a penniless lawyer ? Why should hep119have been any different from the other looting friends of Grant 's ? Why should he , too , not have shared in the profits of the Republican Party during the Reconstruction ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scoundrels like Jay Gould and Jim Fiske and Old Drew and Oakes Ames ? But Old Jamie was a Mugwump and Johnny 's father was a Democratand they may have been prejudiced . It was a big square house with a square cupola and a heavy bracketed piazza and a vast lawn ornamented with iron dogs and deer , each surrounded in summer by a hard bed of brilliant begonias or geraniums or salvias . The house was painted an ugly chocolate brown , and from the street the whole place seemed done in hard colors , like a bad oleograph . For some reason even the trees and grass appeared to be an unnatural , hard emerald green . Centuries could not have endowed the place with quaintness or charm . It was uncompromisingly ugly , and although it might stand for centuries , no one could imagine it having ever been occupied by anyone more romantic than pigeon-breasted " statesmen " wearing frock-coats and beards . It belonged to the period of the Reconstruction and was foreverstamped by it . The house belonged to the brother of William Tecumseh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South to the sea . The owner lived always in Washington , and his whole life was spent in politics . He was responsible for a great many of the banking laws passed during the ' eighties and the ' nineties , and he knew how to promote tariffs which helped overgrown " infant industries . " He made a great fortune , but when he died he left nothing to the Town which he had called his home . For a long time after his death the gaunt ugly house remained , an empty and pompous eyesore , but when at last it was pulled down and the csl ite broken up into building lots , all trace of John Sherman and John Sherman 's Place vanished from the Town which all his life he had used as a political convenience . There were some in the Town who sarcasticallyregarded the disappearance of the chocolate-brown house as regrettable , for it would have made a splendid monument , in all itsp120tasteless and pretentious ugliness , to the era out of which it was born . Over it hung the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " public-be-damned " Vanderbilt , who had contempt for the common people whose judgment Jamie and the Colonel honored and believed that the country should be ruled by men who knew how to make money . When Johnny was a small boy the Sherman Place still existed and the house was inhabited by an ill-tempered caretaker and his wife , whose only diversion was the pursuit of small boys who climbed the fences to steal the grapes and apples and pears that grew on John Sherman 's land . For Johnny the raids held a special excitement because he was never quite sure that he might not be pursued by the devil himself . Out of all the fierce political arguments he had overheard he had come to believe that John Sherman and the devil were one and the same . Beyond the Sherman Place there were no old houses and the street belonged to the New Era . The houses stood side by side , each surrounded by a big lawn planted with shrubs and sapling trees , for few of the houses were more than a dozen years old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of granite and sandstone , each surrounded not by fields and forest and mountains , but by a tiny strip of carefully watered lawn , the bastard offspring of strange matings of styles which took place in the brains of the architects of the day . Unlike the worn , dignified old houses near the center of the Town and the rambling old white house at the Farm which . had an air of belonging to the earth itself , they were boastful houses conceived by childish minds and executed in children 's blocks . They made a fantasticcollection in which Tudor and Byzantine ornamentation bedeckedthe same doorways , and vast sheets of plate glass destroyed all privacy and revealed the inmates like goldfish in a bowl . Plate glass was a sign of prestige . It was expensive , and the larger the windows the more prosperous the inhabitant of the house . One or two of the houses  --  the least offensive of all  --  were born of no style whatever ,  |p121but  were simply the efforts of small-town architects to create something which had never existed before  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange openings mid fantastic doorways , all massed in a frozen agitation . These new houses were built of coal and railroads , politics and public contracts , like that which set the absurd **28;1972;TOOLONG tin gazebo atop the monstrousCourt House on the square . just as the john Sherman Place was a monument to the Reconstruction , so were most of these houses monuments to the era of McKinley and Hanna , Aldrich and Foraker . The strange mongrel fortresses were the strongholds of men who lived by the faith that any man was a fool not to make as much money as possible , no matter how he made it . In them dwelt a band of men who sought to become the new aristocracy of the country , men like Bentham , the peddler , who carried his background , his tradition , his responsibilities , his ideals in a pack . Mostly they were common , undistinguished men , differing from their fellows only in their shrewdness , which all too often slipped over the borderland into the realm of the unscrupulous and the criminal  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privilege in a democracy . On the corner of the street opposite the Sherman Place stood the turreted red sandstone palazzo of Senator Bentham , the grandson of the peddler . It had vast sheets of plate glass which were the largest in the Town and a vast Byzantine piazza ornamented with rubber plants and Aspidistras . He still owned the dry-goods store which had descended from " Bentham 's Great Bazaar . Household Goods , Hardwareand Miscellany , " but he allowed others to run it and scarcely ever entered its doors . He had a business much greater than that . it was politics . He could deliver votes and bully lawmakers. and he came more and more to live in Washington , where he had a house with even bigger windows of plate glass . He was descended from those men who long ago met in Essex County to lay the foundations of New England fortunes by swindling the veterans of the Revoluionout of their rewards .  |p122The  house where Johnny was born stood on the edge of the Sherman Place . It was built in the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It occupied the center of a town lot seventy-five feet wide and a hundred feet long , raised above the level of the street on a bank six or seven feet high . It was tall and narrow and had a slate roof . Once it had been painted a gaudy yellow and white which gave it a kind of bedizened gaiety like an ugly woman too much painted , but by the time Johnny was born it was slate gray because that was a color which ( lid not show the ravages of the soot which sometimes drifted from the Flats into the " decent " part of Town . For ornamentation it had a great deal of bracketing and tiny gables growing at random out of the steep roof . Like the house of John Sherman , no amount of age could have made it any lovelier . The only softening influences were the masses of clematis and honeysuckle and old-fashioned roses called Baltimore Belles which cowered much of the offensive jig-saw work and bound it to the earth . The roses grew in clusters and were pinkish white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes eaten both by birds and children . The lot was divided by the house into a front and a back yard , and at one side there was a carriage drive which led to the stables , which were happily painted red . The front porch was so overgrown with a tangle of flowering vines that one could sit there all day watching the passers-by without ever being seen . The back porch was partly closed in , and in hot weather was used as a kitchen , and beyond it there was an arbor covered with Concord and Niagara grapes which never ripened , because the children ate them all before their time . Beyond the arbor there was a big rose-garden and borders given over to flowers , and at last a vegetable-garden . Here and there stood fruit trees , one of sweet cherries which , like the grapes , were never allowed to ripen . There were pears and peaches , and against the red barn a tree which bore enormous red plums . In October there always stood beneath the grape-arbor a whole hogshead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be drawn upon by Johnny 's family and half the neighborhood until it had turned hard and Johnny'sp123mother emptied into it the remains of last year 's vinegar and had it put away in the cellar . Before it turned , gallons of it went down the throats of neighborhood children who at night preyed upon the hogsheadarmed with bits of rubber tubing . The inside of the house should have been as ugly as the outside , but it had beauty , the kind of beauty which comes to a house which has been lived in for years by a hospitable , noisy , and happy family . There was little in it of value , and even that little was never spared nor allowed to interfere with the enjoyment and hard living . There were many . things which were monstrously ugly , not because there had been any special bad taste employed in its choice , but because the taste at the end of the nineteenth century was monstrously bad over all of Europe and America , and so a modest family in a small city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the furniture had been chosen by Johnny 's parents , but a great deal of it was made up of wedding gifts and inheritances and odds and ends left behind from time to time by Johnny 's migratory uncles and aunts . Due to their restlessness and adventures , the furniture was always in a state of flux . All of them sought to leave as much as possible with Johnny 's parents in order to save storage costs , and usually there was enough furniture for a house and a family three times as large as Johnny 's . In all the strange assortment there was not one piece with the grace of eighteenth century or the heavy elegance of the early nineteenth . As in the architecture of the John Sherman Place , the ugly times were reflected in the ugliness of the furniture . It was only when old Jamie came to live with the family , bringing with him the Colonel 's Chair and cherry bed and one or two tables , that any beautiful furniture found its way into the house . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to the upper rooms . Beneath its curve stood a strange fat-bellied piece of furniture known as the " hall seat , " which for some reason guarded all the family photographs and daguerreotypes within its abdomen . Beside it hung a mirror left behind permanently by one of the wanderingaunts who found its cumbersome gold-and-black curlicues too fragile to stand the rigors of her endless travels.  |p124On  the right of the hall was the parlor , a room which , contrary to all custom of the time and the country , was in constant use , due , I think , to the fact that there were always so many people in the house that there was an overflow from the other rooms . It had a figured green Axminster carpet and elegant dark-red wall paper heavily embossed with a design in gold . But the furniture achieved perhaps the greatest peak of elegance known to the civilized world . It was intensely individualistic , the conception of some workman who held all styles and periods in indiscriminate admiration and sought to combine the more elegant points of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mahogany " suite " and the chairs had the appearance of very fat elderly women suffering from arthritis who had tiny feet and ankles of which they were excessively proud . The most agitated rococo in the same room with those chairs would have seemed of a delicate and classic purity . There was a mantelpiecein golden oak with a mirror above and a gas grate below in which the flames licked a waterfall of asbestos and gave off phosphorescentcolors . And in one corner there was a huge engraving in a wide red plush frame ( a wedding gift ) of a young woman in nondescript peasant 's costume in the foreground resting a jug of water on a stile . In the distance appeared the towers and spires of a town which greatly resembled Oxford . The picture was called " A Dream of the Future , " although what the title meant Johnny had no idea . The problem tormented for years , and long after the house had been sold and the picture had disappeared he would wake up in the night and suddenly remember it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the end of the hall was the dining-room , which was furnished in a gold oak suite very nearly as eccentric as the parlor chairs . It had yellow wall paper , and at the top of the wall was pasted a frieze of Japanese irises which had been cut from a horticultural catalogue left behind by the husband of Aunt Bertha , who for a brief period had worked for a company of bulb and seed growers . The irises were twice their natural size and exquisitely painted in water-color on rice paper by some Japanese craftsman . They were cut out andp125pasted on the wall by Johnny 's older sister in a sudden burst of creative expression , and they were always a source of uneasiness to Johnny 's mother , who knew their value and feared that their rightfulowner might some day track them down and claim them . The dining-room had an air of gaiety about it , due , I think , to the fact that it had a bow window and an open fireplace which gave it a charm the other more " modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn room which adjoined the diningroom , and in it , closed in a vast bookcase , were all the hooks upon which Johnny and his brother and sister fed as children . They ranged in rows  --  all the writings of Dickens and Thackeray , George Eliot and Walter Scott , Fenimore Cooper and Trollope . All the solid Victorians were there , each with his great shelf of achievement , the joy and wonder of childhood and early adolescence . And there was Ridpath 's History of the World with the most fascinating pictures of life in prehistoric times , the Battle of Marathon and the Baptism of Clovis , and four immensely heavy volumes profusely illustrated called Characters from Fiction , Poetry and the Drama . This was a kind of encyclopaedia of literary characters , and its delights were inexhaustibleif somewhat patchy . It , too , had wonderful pictures . There was " Boadicea and Her Daughters " and " Meg Merriles Before Her Cave " and " Jane Shore Driven from London . " It was a singularly comfortable room , worn and cheerful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , horribly bored , sometimes went vaguely over his accounts , and at which his mother was forever writing letters to her wandering sisters and brothers . Off it there was a big room with a bow window and a huge tin bathtub , so large that a child could swim in it . When Johnny was ten years old , a modern bathroom was installed abovestairs and the old bat broom was converted into an alcove off the living-room and ornamented by innumerable copies of Gibson pictures made and offered by an admirerto Johnny 's older sister . But the kitchen was the most important room in the house . In it were cooked the puddings , the pies , the cakes , the waffles , and the pancakes which filled the table meal after meal . The cuisine was ap126purely traditional one , preserved and carried on through generations . Because Johnny 's mother had lived for years in the same house with her mother-in-law she knew all the dishes which had come down from Elvira van Essen , as well as all those which she knew as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each generation- and each marriage new recipes had been added to those already established , and there were many , too , which came into the family through the Negroes who from the days of the Underground Railroadhad always been friendly with the family of old Jamie Ferguson . So there were dishes which had come remotely from Holland and the Rhine country , from Scotland and Shropshire , from Maryland and New England and the far South . Some of them were so special that after Johnny left home be never again encountered them . Johnny 's mother was an excellent cook and , like all good cooks , had a passion for the art . It was her greatest means of expression . She came of a family which had always been accustomed only to the best of fowls and finest of cuts and the most succulent of vegetables and fruits , for they came from the family 's own barnyards and gardens and orchards . In the richness of the bounty , only the best parts of the sheep and pig and beef were eaten . The rest was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dogs . It was a family in which the tradition persisted that in hard times one might wear shabby clothes in a pinch , but one could never go withoutgood food . In the kitchen , even at the most precarious financial moments which in Johnny 's family came all too often , there was never any economy . At prosperous moments , when it was possible to have a servant or two , Johnny 's mother concocted the more important dishes and surveyed the cooking of the others . When there were no servants , she did it all herself . In her kitchen there was always a crock filled with cookies to be raided l ) y the children who came to play in the back yard , and there were always slices of pie and cake which might be stolen between meals . In the kitchen took place the great family rite of making Christmas candy , which must have been German in origin and come down from the Rhineland country through the vanp127Essens . It was a business which continued for days before Christmas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole of a large family , but for friends as well . Most of the recipes had been handed down for generations , and although from time to time experiments were made , the new candies were almost always rejected in the end . A good many of them had as ingredients the hickory-nuts and black walnuts of the countryside , which the children gathered on brilliant October afternoons on long excursions across country . Somehow , perhaps from out of the old wilderness tradition , wild nuts were never looked upon as private property in the County . Few farmers protested at trespassers who came to gather nuts . If the owner objected , he was regarded as cranky and eccentric . At the Farm there was never any question of driving away strangers who came to gather nuts and mushrooms unless they came too near to the farmhouse and violated the privacy which old Jamie cherished . It was only when the dark people came to the Flats that the old generosity came to end , for with them the manners changed . Fences were cut , songbirds were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when one by one the old farms began to pass into the hands of Czech and Silesian peasants , every nut and mushroom was gathered and sent off to market , and the old expeditions came to an end forever . Abovestairs in the house where Johnny was born there were a half-dozen rooms . One belonged to his parents and one to his sister and one to his brother and himself . There was the " spare room " and the " sewing-room "  --  a big room at the back of the house which was a fine place to play on rainy days . Opposite it there was a smaller room which was occupied by a servant during periods of prosperity , and when the day of servants passed altogether , it was occupied by Johnny 's Grandfather Willingdon . But of all the house the attic and the cellar were the parts full of enchantment for the children . The house was gabled , and each gable made a nook in the roof of the attic which might be used as a wigwamor a fortress . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bits of old clothing which could be used for dressingp128up . It was a dark place and there were corners where the mice scuttered about which were full of mystery and horror . In the middle of it there was a vast square tank of zinc used as a reservoir for rain water and when anyone belowstairs turned a tap the tank gave out sinister gurgling sounds which seemed mysterious and supernatural . If one stood on an old trunk one could peer over the edge into black water which seemed as bottomless as the subterranean pits of Pelleas and Melisande . Paradoxically , there was nothing dark or sinister about the cellar . In winter and in had weather the children gathered there after school . It was divided into two parts by a stone wall and on one side was the furnace-room , and on the other the cold room where meats and vegetables and canned fruit were kept . The cold room was a dark , damp place with a little trench along the walls , which was nearly always full of water which seeped in from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the countryside . There were great bins filled with potatoes and Hubbard squash and apples , and from the beams hung hams and flitches of bacon which had been cured according to family recipes in old Jamie 's smokehouse at the Farm . In the center stood an instrument of torture and boredom known as The Pump . It forced the rain water from the cistern in the garden to the tank in the attic , and when Johnny and his brother grew old enough it was their task to keep the tank filled . This meant pumping half an hour at least four times a week , and a hatred for the Pump darkened all their childhood . The furnace-room was quite a different place , warm , dry , and friendly . In it there was a moldiest and a workbench and great boxes and bags of butternuts and hickory-nuts and black walnuts which the children cracked with hammers from the toolchest and ate all during the long winters . ' lime was always a supply of fresh , clean pine wood put in by Mr. Willingdon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Johnny 's own products were invariably ships  --  rowboats , sailing-boats , liners , and battleships . Even as a child there was in him a desire to escape the Town and see the world , and somehow the ships gave him satisfaction . Launched in a pool or in a gutterp129or even in the vast zinc bathtub , they magically grew into full size . The gutter became a vast river and the bathtub a shoreless sea . In the furnace-room the dogs had a corner to themselves behind the clumsy hot-air furnace where it was always warm . There was a long procession of them . Sometimes there were three or four and never were there less than two . There were two collies and a bulldog , a hound , and a nondescript animal called Tuck . None of them ever knew leash or muzzle . They ran free wherever they chose over all the Town , but almost always they stayed in the company of the neighborhood children , taking part in all the games , barking and wagging their tails , going on swimming expeditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took place in spring and autumn up and down hill across country . One or two of them came to tragic ends . Two were poisoned and one , a puppy , was run over by Stuhldreher 's delivery wagon . Most of them died quietly of old age , but not the least of them was ever forgotten . There was Schwartz and Laddie , Budge and Champ , Dash and Wilfred ( named after a remote family cousin whom he resembled ) . Each guarded forever , long after his death , his own charm and individuality , and no other dog ever took the place even of Tuck , the shabbiest and worst bred of the lot , who looked like an overgrown beagle , but had long hair like a collie . Beyond the Sherman Place there was an expanse of land where once there had been farms , but by the time Johnny was born the land had , long since been bought up by speculators and turned into building lots . But the boom had come too soon and the whole expanse , crisscrossed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the goldenrod and the elderberry bushes and the burdock were remnants of old orchards or an old brick farmhouseor the new modest wooden house of a shopkeeper . On one side of the road which led through the expanse toward the Farm rich men from the fantastic houses on Elm Street and Maple Avenut were constructing a golf-links , one of the first in all that part of the country . It was a modest affair , but in a curious way it was linkedp130with the turreted houses . Their owners had begun by wanting to live grandly . The golf-links were the next step . They wanted to learn how to play as gentlemen and rich men should do . Besides , it was a good investment . It carried implications of wealth and credit and leisure . Beyond the wasteland and the golf-links were the parks . There were South Park and Middle Park and Casino Park , and they came into existence through the efforts of old General Vandervelde , who fought for them at a time when booming cities were disposed to think more of profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three sections of the original forest , with streams of water running through them . They were filled with oak and beech and maple trees , and in spring and early summer the earth beneath the trees was covered with spring beauties and violets and wood anemones . In those days there were no automobiles , and on a hot summer night when the corn grew and ripened in the ( lamp tropical heat it was the custom to harness the horses and drive out to the parks . Linder the great trees there were tables and benches , and on some nights all of them were filled with families who had come to spend the long summer twilight in the open air . There were always plenty of children with whom you might play prisoner's-base and hide-andseek . Sometimes you were allowed to play late , and then sometimes in the darkness you came across couples lying in the grass and the night filled you with awe for something you did not understand . No one ever picnicked in Middle Park where the monument to Johnny Appleseed raised its modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Park and Casino Park . South Park had its own special and undefiled rustic charm , but as one grew older its sylvan attractions faded before the more worldly glory of Casino Park . Here there was a casino  --  a rambling wooden building with a theater abovestairs and a huge ice-cream parlor below . And close at hand there was a ferris wheel and a scenic railway and a swimming-pool . In those days the Town was still small enough for one to know almost everyone who frequented Casino Park . In the theater there was always a stock company which performed most of the old-fashioned playsand some of the newer melodramas . One could see " Fast Lynne " and " Camille , " " The Adventuress , " and a strange Biblical piece called " Salome " which had nothing to do with the preciositics of Oscar Wilde and was regarded as a " spectacle . " The actors lived in cheap boarding-houses in the Town and one had the added glamour of knowing them by sight and seeing them both in real life and on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least past the age when all save themselves knew there was no longer any hope of playing on Broadway . They were a queer tatteredcrew , rather like those immortal troupers , the Crummles . As a child Johnny had felt awe and affection for them , and as he grew older the awe lessened but the affection increased . There was always a " juvenile " well past forty who on the street appeared to be an old man , but on the stage became miraculously rejuvenated by thick applications of " hero flush , " and there was an ingenue , likewise rather battered by her long experience with life , who invariably had the most astonishing peroxide golden hair and wore high buttoned shoes of glace kid . And there was the " heavy man " and the " heavy woman " and the " character man " and the " character woman , " who had already known long , rich careers as juvenile and ingenues . By the time they attained character parts they appeared older than God . At the first performance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mary Garden , created a scandal by doing " The Dance of the Seven Veils . " Johnny was taken to the perform , ance as a treat by Greataunt Jane , who believed the piece to be a kind of religious mystery , and as such indeed it had been advertised , No hint of the dance had been given out until the program was distributedamong the audience . In it there appeared the legend , " The Dance of the Seven Veils will be danced by Miss Lilli ( le Lisle , who created the role of Salome at the first world performance in the Newark ( N. J. ) Opera House . " Newark , I suppose , was as near as they dared to aspire to Broadway . One by one Miss Lilli de Lisle cast aside the seven veils , appearing at the end clad in a flesh-pink union suit over which she wore a kind of corset cover ornamented with passementerie and a long skirt made of fringe . After letters of prof ' kp132appeared in the local papers and the subject was mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a management eager to preserve the reputation of the Casino as " a family theater . " But Greataunt Jane was indignant over the protests . To Johnny 's mother she said , " Why , she showed nothing at all , not even a pimple . At her age she could n't afford to show anything . I could have done as well myself . " And for days Johnny was haunted by a vision of GreatauntJane clad in a pink union suit with a corset cover of passementerie . There were no picture houses and the Casino Stock Company did a thriving business . The bast seats cost thirty-five cents , and the poorest but ten . The sides of the theater had enormous shutters which opened outward , thus permitting you to sit in the open air on those hot , still Middle-Western nights . But this form of ventilation had one great disadvantage . It lay in the fact that the tracks of the Baltimore and Ohio railroad ran past the Casino at a distance of less than a hundred yards , and when a long freight-train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dialogue had to be suspended , so that on the stage one had the effect of , a moving picture suddenly arrested . One night in the course of a melodrama the evening-freight chose to arrive at a moment during the big scene of the play when the " heavy , " having been double crossed by the " heavy woman , " was throttling her . She lay across a sofa with her head toward the audience , her hennamahoganyhair flowing loose , while the villain knelt on her stomach , choking her . The " heavy " had gotten " into the part , " and rather than spoil his effect by suspending the action he continued throttling her until the train had passed . It was a long freight-train and he must have shaken her for fifteen minutes , his face streaming with perspiration ( for she was heavy not only in her art , but in her physique ) before he was able to toss her aside , exhausted and black and blue , with the cry , " Never cross my path again unless you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment it would have been difficult to imagine . But to a small boy none of this seemed ridiculous and to a small nineteenth-century romantic like Johnny who all his life foundp133glamour and charm in any actor no matter how bad he was , the " heavy " might have gone on strangling the " heavy woman " while all the freight-trains in America groaned up the long hill , and the scene could never have been ridiculous . But , alas ! there was in the family of old Jamie and Johnny 's mother a shadowy Calvinist distrust of the stage and everything which had to do with it . They went to the theater , but they sat there uneasily , faintly suspicious of everyone from the star of the piece down to the man who sold tickets at the door of the Soldier 's and Sailor 's Memo , rial Opera House . In that family there had never been bohemian tradi tion . Actors had no homes and therefore were not responsible citizens . And indeed among those who played year after year above the noise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be made against such accusations . They had not the discretion which must accompany intrigues in a smallish city . Always from the middle of the summer on there was a small crop of scandals centering about the Casino Stock Company . The character man got drunk . The juvenile and the " heavy woman " were living in sin . Usually eight or nine months after the Casino had closed and the trees of the park were bare of leaves , one or two stage-struck girls who lived on the wrong side of the railroad tracks had babies by one of the troupe , and once one of the respectable families on Elm Street was shattered when the middle-aged mother conceived a passion for the man who played " The Little Minister " and eloped with him . He was a singularly repulsive fellow ; with a stomach , a big nose , and enormous calves which he displayed in silk stockings in " The Little Minister . " ( It was one of the plays considered pure enough for Johnny to witness . ) After the elopement there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny overheard . Eavesdropping , he heard a middle-aged friend of his mother 's say , " I ca n't sec what she saw in him . He was too virile looking , " and from that day the word virile always meant to Johnny huge calves , a big nose , and a stomach . Because of the family feelings toward actors they became doubly exciting to Johnny , so that if ever he encountered any of the stock company in the street he could not resist following them at a distancep134for blocks , sometimes even waiting outside shops until they reappeared . He did not know what he expected of them  --  perhaps that they would suddenly display horns and hoofs and a tail . It may have been that the fascination arose from the restlessness and hunger to see what lay beyond the borders of the ' Town . Actors traveled . They had no fixed homes . They had been everywhere . They knew the world . Actors fascinated Johnny as a little boy and they never ceased to fascinate him . Much later in life he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the professions none contained people so human , so generous , so preposterous and so lovable . The " artistes " in the poor defeated troupes which played in the Casino while the freight-trains passed were very like a good many of the great and successful ones . They were all geniuses and a little vain , good-natured and easy-going , egotistical and fantastic , and although most of them had no talent whatever , the theater was a living place to them and something to which they sacrificed fortune and respectability and a settled , comfortable life . It was a good ideal , but one not much understoodin a world where success or defeat and even life itself was often enough a simple , uncomplicated affair of outward sexual respectabilityand dollars and cents ; Yet those troupers were able to create something for which the stolid audience was hungry  --  an excitement and gaiety and glamour which was never to be found among the battlemented houses of Maple Avenue and Elm Street . In the Town , twenty-five cents was a good deal of money for a small boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be thought of twice , especially in a family which knew moments when twenty-five cents was a considerable sum ; so for Johnny there was never any danger of becoming satiated with the drama . But on the nights when Johnny had no spending-money or the play was considered improper , it was possible to stand outside the theater and listen to the dialogue , especially the dialogue of the most exciting parts which were either thundered or uttered in prodigious stage whispers . He would stand beside the gold-fish pond littered with old newspapers and torn and empty cracker-jack boxes , listening to the heroine denouncing the villain . For the rest of his life he remembered exactly how the gravelp135looked underfoot and how the water trickled into the pool and the spots on the mottled trunk of the old sycamore tree which rose high above the Casino roof , while he stood listening to the rantings of the villain hurrying to finish his speech before the arrival of the evening freight-train . At the tables in Casino Park there were always dozens of other families , and sometimes there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night . On most of the tables there were big steins of beer , but never were there any on the table occupied by Johnny 's family , for his mother was the daughter of the first Prohibitionistin the County . When the twilight was gone people played by the light of the arc lamps . It was all neighborly and everybody knew everybody else . There was something Germanic and gemiitlich about it all . A little way from the Casino there was a tiny artificial lake with swans , and a little island with a Belvedere , and the greatest possible treat was to rent a boat and row about the lake , a journey which took at most ten minutes . But time had nothing to do with the excursion ; one was on the water and on the water anything might happen . The water in that silly little lake eventually reached the ocean by way of the Ohio and the Mississippi , and the ocean meant escape and adventure . The lake itself was never much of a success , for every two or three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was where that great institution known as a family reunion took place . It was , I think , an affair which belonged especiallyto the people of the country beyond the Appalachians , for it served to reunite , every few years , all the descendants of the original families who had come across the mountains a hundred years earlier . They came , the descendants , from all parts of the County and the State , and sometimes whole prosperous families returned from the Far West on the occasion of the tribal gathering . The festivities began early in the morning and continued far into the night with masses of pie and cake , roast turkey and ice crcatn , and afterward in the Town newspapers there was always a long account of the speeches and the singing and the reading of the family records , with a corn/plete list of all those who attended . Sometimes the singing had a great wild beauty . Sometimes a very old lady would stand up at the table beneath the trees to sing , in a cracked voice , a whole collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . As a child Johnny sometimes stood on the outskirts of these vast family gatherings , wishing that he belonged to a family which had such merry gargantuan conventions once every few years . His father'sfamily never had much taste for keeping up family ties . His father and grandfather Willingdon were , in different ways , both passionate individualists -- -cold toward ties of the blood and soft toward their friends from the world about them . And his mother 's family always had the farm to go to . At the Farm there was a perpetual reunion , but in the eyes of a child it lacked , by its very usualness , the pomp and ceremony of those vast tribal gatherings in Casino Park . The parks have lost their place in the sun . No longer does the old air of festivity exist . The stock company no longer suspends the action of " East Lynne " while the B. &; O. freight-train passes by , and the vast family reunions are almost a thing of the past . If anyone frequents the parks now it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whose children , brought up upon the anemic movies , will never know the glories of the Casino Stock Company whose actors were on view in the daytime on Main Street . Beyond the parks one entered the open country with a sense of freedom and escape . It was not very wild country . The fields were all neatly hedged and fenced , and in Johnny 's childhood the farmhousesalong the road were still fairly prosperous in appearance and well painted . Here and there on the rolling landscape there was a hillside still covered with a patch of forest left uncleared out of the first wilderness . It was not very wild country , but here there was room to breathe . Here there were no untidy vacant lots and crowded houses . There was no smoke or soot or any sound of rolling-mills . Once you had passed the parks you were in the open country . You were free !  |p137Johnny  knew each farm along the road which led at the end to his grandfather 's house . He knew them as they were and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has happened to them since , One crossed a little valley through which ran the brook called Toby 's Run . Beyond the bridge there was a hedge of osage orange which , long left untended , grew high above the top of the buggy and dropped by the roadside enormous green oranges which the children gathered to play with . Then one crossed the Baltimore and Ohio tracks , a haunted spot at night because a whole family returningfrom a Fourth of July celebration had been killed there and because an old woman called Janes , returning to her farm , had once been robbed and beaten by the tramps who hid in the ragged hedge of osage orange . At the top of the hill just beyond stood the farmhouse of the Ernsts . He was an immigrant from Germany . He had come over when a boy and he was at that time perhaps the only farmer of foreign birth in all the County . As such , he was always regarded as a little strange . He never exchanged visits , perhaps because no one wanted him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sometimes one saw him in the distance in passing , at work repairing a fence or clearing a fence row . His wife one never saw save from a long way off working in the bright peasant 's garden which she had created about the ugly house . I do not think there were many festivitiesin the lip es of the Ernsts , nor much that was bright . They were the first to bring with them into the County the peasant traditionsof Europe , and the first who rose at daylight to work until ( lark , the first to cultivate every inch of fence row and to plant fruit trees and berries in every inch of available space . I think that toward the end he was disliked because he worked so hard and was prosperous , while in the shadow of the growing factories in the Town the old native farmers fell slowly into bankruptcy . Just beyond the Ernsts , on the opposite side of the road , stood the house of the widow Mills , and the contrast between the two places could not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brick and covered with flowering vines , and it stood back from thep138road , with a wide garden in front which was filled with syringas and lilacs , weigelia and laburnums , and in summer against the brick wall of the house in neat rows stood pot after pot of geraniums and heliotrope and begonias which in winter she kept inside . It was as English as any place could have been  --  a house and garden which one might have found in Sussex instead of in the Middle West . An orchard surrounded die whole house , and under the drooping boughs bees hummed about a dozen hives . The widow Mills ' sons did the farming and at that time they were still prosperous . She was a small , rather withered wotn ; ul with bright blue eyes and a  --  hard mouth , and she lived very much to herself in the way of people who have a Dassionate love for flowers and trees and gardens and spend all their days among them . Occasionally when Johnny 's grandmother passed she would come out of the orchard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk with Maria Ferguson about the better days which had passed and to make bitter comments about their neighbors . Farther along there was the township schoolhouse , long disappeared , and then one came to the house of " the Peckham girls . " When Johnny was a child they were already old maids past fifty , but in the family they were always known as " the Peckham girls . " They were called Mary and Martha and were very different in appearance and personality . Their father had been a great friend of old Jamie 's and so Johnny 's family rarely passed the Peckham place without stopping to exchange gossip . Martha was a little birdlike woman with a merry face covered with fine wrinkles , and in the division of duties she it was who ran the house and had charge of the chickens and bees and pigeons . Of the two , Mary was vastly more imposing . She was a big , handsome , mannish woman who dressed severely and walked with a slight limp . She managed the farm labor and sold all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been . They belonged purely to the old tradition and so neither of them did any work about the place save in the house and garden . There was no peasant in them . The Peckham place was in the tradition neither of the Ernsts nor of the Mills , but belonged to the ' eighties . The house and barn were always kept brightly painted and in excellent repair ,  |p139so  that , although they were at least forty years old when Johnny first knew them , they still had an air of neat old-maidish newness . Every tree and shrub was meticulously pruned and there was never a blade of grass out of place . The whole house and garden and barnyardhad the air of a chromo . But Mary Peckham had trouble finding labor , for the tradition got about that she was stiff-necked and much too exacting . Yet she had a prevailing charm and a good sense of humor . For Johnny she had a special fascination because she was the first person he had ever seen with one blue eye and one brown . Beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locust trees , and came to the little hollow where the yellow-and-white cottage of the Lunts ' sat with an orchard on one side and a barn and horse-pond on the other . It was the horse pond which Johnny envied the Lunts , because at the Farm there was no pond where you could sail boats , but only the swift-running brook . All the Lunts were old . Johnny never knew how many of them there were . The youngest generation had all gone off to Town , and as the carriage drove past the Lunts place one had the impression of thin old people peering out of the doors and windows at the sound of hoofbeats on the road . Usually old Mrs. Lunts came out and stood on the little piazza , staring wistfully at the passers-by . No one knew how old she was , but she must have been one of the early settlers in the County . I think that in her old age she was lonely . Sometimes she smiled and nodded and sometimes she gave no sign of recognitionat all . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her chin and nose very nearly touched each other . She always stood with one thin hand wrapped in her clean apron and the other pressed against her thin lips . She gave the feeling of an old woman who was awaiting some one . She was so very old that it may only have been death she was awaiting . Beyond the Lunts ' came the twin farms of the Condons . They were owned by two brothers , the nephews of old Anne Condon , who long ago had gone bumping along the road in Greatuncle Jacob 's buckboard . Her deserted little house still stood on its high bank by the roadside , half-buried in a tangle of flowers and vines . Frankp140Condon , the older brother , never married and always lived alone in a low brick house lost in a thicket of sassafras trees . He quarreled with his brother and with all his neighbors , and as he grew older he no longer cultivated his farm but let the fields disappear under waves of goldenrod . In passing one sometimes caught a terrifying glimpse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the branches of the sassafras trees which surrounded the house . Children ran past the place when they came to that part of the road . People said he had been disappointed iii love as a young man and that he never recoveredfrom the shock . A few mangy chickens scratched about the door , but what he ate always remained a mystery . He died at last with only his dog in the house . It was the howling of his dog and the fact that for three ( lays no smoke came from his chimney which led his brother to enter the house for the first time in thirty years . He died in his sleep . One crossed the tracks of the Erie Railroad and on the tracks one caught a faint distant glimpse of the Farm with the big low white house pressed close against the hill beneath the dark Norway spruce . At sight of it the children grew restless , squirming and begging to be let down from the buggy . Sometimes they ran beside it and sometimes in summer they ran across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at the end there was a whole life which was different from the prosaic life of the Town , a life filled with exciting adventurewhich centered about Maria standing at the gate in the whitewashedpicket fence to greet her grandchildren . For a child it was a fascinating journey made with impatience . to reach the end , and in his impatience and his childishness Johnny never saw the signs of change which were taking place day by day before his eyes . He did not know , like his grandfather , old Jamie , that not one of the farms along the way , save that of the Peckham girls , was what it had been ( luring his youth and middle-age . Johnny never saw that some of the houses were in need of paint and that here and there a fence had been patched once too often . Nor did he notice that there were almost no young people and that as soon as the children grew up they disappeared , nor that there were no longerp141any good " hired men , " but only wastrels and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the Town to spend the money on drink or to disappear forever . And as he could not sec inside the farmhouses , he knew nothing of the mortgages made again and again in the hope that next year they would be paid off , nor of the falling prices of cattle and grain and the rising prices of clothing and farm machinery and furniture and all the things manufactured and marketed by business men . Week after week Johnny made the journey to the Farm , and week after week , year after year , life grew a little harder for the farmer and the farms changed a little always for the worse . In the Town , the church was still a force which concerned itself with preaching and missionaries and made no pretense at being " modern . " The preacher did not attempt to be just another business man , and simple faith had not yet been compromised . Religion was religion . Philosophy was something else and no one had attempted to make the lion and the lamb lie down together . The church was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profound influence upon family life . The Strawberry Festival which took place under the trees of the Congregational churchyard , the weekly high teas of the Missionary Society , the Quarterly Supper of the Ladies Aid Society organized to pay off the church debt , were events in which every solid respectable family took part . It was about the church that the Town organized itself socially . When a good citizen died , the obituaries always said that " he had been a practicing Christian and a lifelong member of the church . " The country club had not yet been born . The social layers into which the Town settled were smaller but no less complexly organized than those of London or Paris or New York . It was society in petto with all the banal and classic prejudices and virtues , mockeries and successes . In the Town Proust could have found all the Guermantes and Charluses and Swarms . One could have found Odette and Albertine . There were Democrats and Republicans and a little handful of Socialists , Jeffersonians and Hamiltonians , Rooseveltians , Bryanites , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bonapartists , Radicals and partisans of the Third Republic ; and the shades of political opinion were felt sometimes openly , sometimes subtly in the social contacts and ambitions , for ever among the " self-made men " and the " business men " there was a faint social itch , which in their wives broke out often enough into an angry rash . Each church had its place in the scheme , and one 's affiliation with this sect or that made one 's success difficult or easy . Now and then a Baptist or a Methodist family became members of the Congregationalchurch for the " sake of the children , " and more often when parents chose to remain faithful to a less fashionable sect the childrenbecame Presbyterians or Congregationalists or Episcopalians . Just as the Town itself was a transplanted New England town with secondary Scottish characteristics , so the Congregational church was the church , with the Presbyterian a close second . The Episcopal church came into importance with the rise of the turreted baronial houses when , mysteriously , the wealthy , finding its conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worship the God of the privileged . But there was always something faintly vulgar about it , something which had the odor of great wealth recently acquired , often enough by methods that were none too scrupulous . To the old citizens it was always spoken of as the church which belonged to the " new people . " The Town , if questioned , would have professed to be what it had started out to be  --  a Republican and Democratic community , free of snobbery or ideas that any man or woman was better than another ; but no one ever questioned the Town , and certainly no one ever discussed without self-consciousness such a thing as one 's position in society . Yet the thing existed . One was aware that being a Baptist was a handicap and that Lutherans were excellent citizens but never lived on Park Avenue or were seen at fashionable weddings or funerals . It was better to live on the wrong side of the railroad tracks and be a friend of the Congregationalists than to live in a house filled with plate glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimesgreat wealth could be of help , but even wealth was useless ifp143you had an accent . There were a thousand other complications lying beneath the surface of a hypocritical simplicity . Nearly all the old families lived in the big houses near the center of the Town , where they dwelt entranced , living off incomes which each year grew a little smaller , just as each new generation seemed to grow a little less vigorous and capable . The whole scene was forever changing and families were always at some stage of the progress from shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves . The picture was classic to the point of banality . And alone on the wrong side of the railroad tracks in Trefusis Castle , surrounded by mills and factories , Czechoslovakians and immigrant Italians , the local Duchesse de Guermantes , Greataunt Jane , dwelt intrenched amid her prejudices and contempt . People sometimes mocked her and her old-fashioned ideas and furniture . She had nearly all the qualifications . She was rich . She had a big house . She was a Congregationalist and belonged to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrong side of the tracks . But she had a standard of her own which was both older and newer than that of the crude world spread upon the hills about her , a standard that was eternal . She did not ask people whether they were rich or poor , whether they lived on the right or the wrong side of the railroad tracks , or whether they were Congregationalistsor Roman Catholics . She demanded only that they be intelligent or distinguished or entertaining . She was rich . The exact amount of her wealth troubled the Town , but no one ever knew until she died , and left almost nothing , how rich she had been  --  not even her own lawyer ever knew . The mills pounded , the soot gradually killed her trees and stifled her flowers , the aliens stared at her when she drove in or out her big wrought-iron gates , but she stood her ground and remained in the saddle to the end , a daughter of the Colonel who had known civilization so well he had sickened of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muskrat 's home in the middle of a swamp and still have dominated the community . The Congregational church was new when o1 ( 1 Jamie had come to the County , but by the time Johnny was born it had almost a look of antiquity . Its bricks were weathered and more than half hidden byp144ivy and ampelopsis and Virginia creeper , and the trees whose big branches brushed the big Gothic windows were enormous . Children  --  even children to whom sermons were tiresome  --  loved it , and it must have given Johnny a great deal of pleasure , for as he grew older he came to think of it more and more frequently and to feel a desire to recover somehow some of the beauty and simplicity of the life which centered about it . When he thought of it , he saw it nearly always on a bright June day with the congregation gathered on the long wide flight of stone steps , gossiping before returning home to roast beef and the Sunday newspapers . His earliest memory was of what was called " the primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed his first assault upon another individual . It was a large square room with the tiny chairs arranged in a circle intercepted by two thrones , on one of which sat Mrs. Mack , who taught the infants ' class for forty years . On the other sat her adjutant , a pretty , faded old maid called Miss Hallowell . If one behaved well , one was given the privilege of sitting once a month beside one or the other . To sit on the right hand of Mrs. Mack was to sit on the right hand of God . At one end of the room were enormous Gothic windows , and on the other three walls hung enormousand brilliant oleographs from the Old Testament . There were the scene of " Jacob and the Heavenly Ladder , " " The Arrival of Sheba " to visit Solomon , with Sheba borne in a litter upon the shoulders of six stalwarts who were neither black nor Hebraic , but resembled young Germans on a walking-tour , and " The Return from the Promised Land , " with Joshua in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of a Nonesuch apple . Beside them , the most gigantic Homburg grapes were no bigger than currants . From her throne at one side of the circle Mrs. Mack told biblical stories . From her throne on the opposite side Miss Hallowell , who had a powerful voice , led the piping sopranos in singing " Jesus Loves Me " and other childish hymns , and outside the circle , rather with the air of animal-trainers , lingered two or three young women whose duty it was to suppress quarrels , quiet tears , and now and then remove a child to the lavatory near by . One of the assistants-playedp145the piano , and when at the close her powerful hands struck a chord all the children rose and marched twice about the circle to the accompaniment of " Onward , Christian Soldiers . " It was during the singing of " Jesus Loves Me " that Johnny committed his assault . The victim was a little boy called Bennett who had sanely hair and was mean and a bully , and the assault came at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being allowed to sit on the right hand of Mrs. Mack . Chance on this Sunday morning placed Johnny and the little Bennett boy side by side in the infants ' circle . Throughout the Bible stories Johnny , plot , ting , struggled with murderous desire , and with the hymn-singing inspiration came . Johnny had a handful of pennies destined to save heathen souls in China and a pair of woolen gloves , and placing the pennies in a finger of one of the gloves , he constructed a murderous blackjack . The assault was the matter of a second . While the Bennett boy sang " Jesus Loves Me " very loudly in order to display his devotion , Johnny got in two or three blows , and then the singing turned into loud wails and Johnny was snatched from his chair by one of the animal-trainers and imprisoned in the lavatory . Behind him Bedlam broke loose , for the smaller children , frightened by the screams of the Bennett boy , began , one after another , to scream , and in order to drown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piano . It did no good . The noise penetrated to other rooms and one by one older children , old gentlemen and ladies , mothers and fathers , flocked into " the primary room , " until at last it was filled with a confusion of parents comforting their children , of aunts and uncles spiriting their nieces and nephews to safety and old ladies all talking at once . In his lavatory prison Johnny sulked alone and forgotten . It was the greatest scandal ever created in the Sunday school and never again did Johnny sit on the right hand of Mrs. Mack , but on that day he achieved the greatest fame he was ever to know in the Town . Most of the entertainment to be had in the Town came through the church . Besides the festivals and missionary teas and Ladies Aid suppers there was always a vast entertainment on Christmas Eve ,  |p146when  all the congregation and Sunday school were present and there were net stockings filled with poisonous dyed candies for all the children . And there were always tableaux and perhaps a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velvet suits recited " The Soldier of Algiers " or sang " Good King Wencelas " in voices trembling with fright or brazen with the confidence of " a " show-off . " Occasionally the church even undertook theatrical entertainments for the benefit of the ( ; hunch Debt or the suffering heathen in far-off China and Africa . When Johnny was three or four years old there was a great fashion for staging " Gibson pictures " as tableaux , and while he was st i l I too young to protest he was chosen to take the role of Cupid , which he enacted modestly clad in a union suit . The fashionlasted several years , so that each year there was a new series to be presented . There was great rivalry in the congregation among the pretty girls who sought to pose in the more attractive scenes . Fortunately , when Johnny was five he had the measles and emerged a thin , lanky child with an overlarge head . His lugubrious appearance unfitted him for the role of Cupid and a plumper and more rosy child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " A Christmas Carol , " in a costume made of black muslin draped with old pump chains to which books had been tied . And once he played the name part in " The Private Secretary " and gave a performance so vile that he was nearly asked to withdraw from the cast on the morning of the performance . And once he played in German in a piece called " Karl Hat Zahnschcncryen , " the lines of which he remembered for years afterward , so great was the mingled vanity and horror at appearing before the public in a foreign tongue . Those premature appearances as Cupid gave him a fixation which to the end of his life forced him to look even upon such harmless entertainment as charades with horror . To a child the church itself seemed a vast place , especially at night when after church suppers in the big basement below , the children escaped their parents and ran upstairs to play in the darkness of the big auditorium . This was not easy to do , for there was always thep147sexton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be avoided . His name was Henry Krebs and he was German by origin , spoke with a German accent , and had a hl , rk heard and a thunderous bass voice . Immediately after the supper was finished belowstairs , he began to prowl about , casting suspicious Mack eyes in the direction of every group of children . I think he enjoyed t he game , but he never gave any sign of it , maintaining always the grimmest of faces and the most savage look in the black eyes . He could have sat for a portrait of any fairy-tale ogre . The game was to escape h i s vigil and run upstairs into the vast darkness of the auditorium , the big halls , the belfry attic , and the organ-room . In these parts of the church there were never any lights , and save in the auditorium , where the faint light of the Town itself came through the big Gothic windows , they were black as the depths of Hades . By that time it was an old church long since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and funerals , and in a curious way I think the children were aware of these memories and that the vague consciousness of them made the nocturnal ramblings profoundlyexciting . Only the brave ones ever penetrated the morbid depths of the organ-loft , a vast cavern of a place filled with treadles and pipes , and only the most daring ever climbed the ladder into the belfry where the pigeons lived . In the hall there was a great double stairway where on Sundays parents and children descended sedately from the services abovestairs . In the darkness these stairways took on a different aspect , for they had rails of polished mahogany which for sliding were a delight , and here after the church suppers the children congregated to slide until interrupted by a bellow from Henry Krebs , at which they scattered like mice into ( lark corners to wait until they heard him grumbling to himself , pass them by on a patrol , which rarely ended in the region of any of the miscreants . As the children grew older , the dark auditorium became also a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darkness of a high pew . I know much courting took place there , and more than one proposal . It was curious that this church , Congregational , Anglo-Saxon , set.  |p148down  on the eastern borders of the Middle West , should have had so much the character of a church in an Italian village . There was no more mysticism about it than there is about an Italian church . It was the center of social and family life . Its entertainments were communal entertainments , and if children thought of God at all it was as rather a pleasant old man , much as Italian children think of Him . In it took place weddings and funerals and festivals and even courting &; There was none of the mysticism one finds in the church of Spain or the chill to ; ! milky of the Church of England or the hysterical atmosphere of revivalist churches . It drew its character more perhaps from the community than from any tradition or ritual , for as its name implies , the Congregational sect is an intensely individualistic one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creeds . There was , therefore , no stamp upon it of an organization of bishops handing down laws received second hand from God himself , and so the character of its individual churches has always veered from an intellectualism which was almost Unitarian to the hysteria of the reforming evangelical churches . It must have been a superior community with more than the average share of good American qualities and less than its share of the bad ones . As a small child Johnny overheard whisperings of various scandals which only later became wholly clear to him . There was the story of a servant coming unexpectedly into the study of the Parish House to find the clergyman holding on his lap in a tight embrace one of the most respectable old maids of the congregation . Looking back upon it long afterward , Johnny found something infinitely pathetic in the picture of a clergyman of nearly sixty , a figure set up by society not only as a model but as a spiritual healer , making love to a dowdy old maid of forty-five who had just lost the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The story got about . The clergyman protested to the deacons who came for an explanation that he was only consoling Miss Wilkes , which may well have been true , but in the end the situation grew out of hand and the clergyman 's position impossible , and he leftp149under a cloud . He was an old man . I do not know what became of him . I think Miss Wilkes rather enjoyed the scandal . At any rate , she came to church brazenly as regularly as before , and for the rest . of her life she could cherish the knowledge that not only had she been attractive to at least one man , but that all the cont ; regat ion and most of the Town knew it . There was another clergyman who was asked to leave because he married eighteen months after his wife died , a fact which his deacons and some of his congregation felt called upon to denounce as fleshly and undignified in a man who was supposed to be all soul and no body , especially since the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scandal between one of the deacons and the female leader of the choir , which everyone , due perhaps to the character of the lovers involved , treated as a comic episode . The deacon was a dandy in a small-town way  --  middle-aged , plump , and given to wearing white waistcoats . His plump figure passed the pew of Johnny 's family when he carried the collection plate on Sundays , his pink , shiny double chin pinched by the starched points of his collar . He was never seen without a flower in his buttonhole . The inamorata was a gaunt horse-faced woman of forty-five who had a booming contralto voice which was the loudest Johnny ever heard . At prayer-meetings , at Sunday school , in church , it always boomed out full and clear like the roaring of the sea , leading the way for more timid voices to follow . Their sin was discovered by a stable boy at the John Sherman Place , who for reasons which have never been quite clear found himself one June night in a buckeye tree above their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable boy , delighted , told all the Town . And there was the scandal of the Presbyterian elder who was caught in the back room of Mrs. Mallop 's millinery shop . I n those ( lays there was always something glamorous and wicked about small-s own milliners . Certainly there was a succession of them in the Town , sometimes two in business at once , and always they seemed to be " widows " and always they suffered from suspicion . As a small boy the house of Mrs. Mallop and her sister in the millinery trade heldp150for Johnny the same exciting awe and mystery as the row of shutteredhouses in the Flats which were always being open or suppressed , according to the moral tone of the community , but which were always there . To the end of his days Johnny will always think of milliners as a little fast . By the time Johnny was born the " hired girl " had gone the way of the " hired man . " No longer did she occupy the old position of frontier equality with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the table after she had carried in the food . No longer was she married , perhaps to a neighboring farmer , in the house of her employer . If she existed any longer it was as a servant who had little more than a servant 's dignity and a little more than a servant 's intimacy with the family for which she worked . The old easy manner of democracy was gone save on distant farms and small villages where among eccentric old people it still lingered , cherished rebelliouslyas something precious . The Town wanted to grow up . It wanted to be like the East . It felt , a little self-consciously , that there was something vulgar about the institution . In the big houses , the very expression " hired girl " began to go out of fashion . It was more " refined " to speak of servants . But it was not only that the attitude of the employer had changed ; the quality of the " hired girl , " like that of the " hired man , " had fallen into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had come , intelligent , independent , and ambitious , over the mountains to make their way in a new world filled with opportunities ; they were of a different sort now , more often than not shiftless , ignorant , ill-educated , and resentful . The grandchildren of those first " hired girls " and " hired men " who came from the East now paid young men and women to work for them , but the relationship had undergone a change . Very few among them were any longer of American stock , and although the immigrantgirls and men went often enough by the old name , the name no longer meant anything . Domestic service , like manual labor , had fallen into disrepute among Americans , and if the " hired girl " was an immigrant , the whole relationship was hopelessly different , forp151all the community looked upon immigrants as a race apart . The immigrant , on his side would have been uncomfortable in the old relationship , even if it had been possible for him to conceive it . Of all the procession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room over the kitchen before Grandfather Willingdon rune to live there , only one was American . She was perhaps the last servant of American lineage in the whole County , and something of the old democratic friendliness persisted in her relations with Johnny 's family . She was a daughter of a farmer who had fallen upon evil days and she was a tall , thin girl with dark hair and eyes and a heart-shaped face . She had a long thin neck and resembled one of the women of Modigliani . For the children she was a great friend , and in Johnny 's mother she confided everything which happened to her and from her she sought advice whenever a problem arose . She stayed with Johnny 's family longer than any " hired girl " who came to work in the Third Street house , and in the end she left only to be married to a young man who presented himself to Johnny 's mother before he asked Mary herself . They were married in Johnny 's house and went to live in Pennsylvania , and long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend a two-day visit . She had weak lungs and until she was married was threatened with tuberculosis , against which she dosed herself with a ferocious concoction known as " skunk oil " which she kept on the sill of the kitchen window . Its smell more than fulfilled the implications of its name , and how Mary Crane was ever able to swallow it remained one of the family mysteries . It may have been that the skunk oil was psychologicalin its effect , but whether it was the oil or matrimony which cured Mary 's lungs no one ever knew . When she returned to visit the family she was cured and resembled a Rubens rather than a Modigliani . Out of all the girls who passed through the little room , only Mary Crane " fitted " into the family . Behind her lay the same blood , the same traditions , the same standards . When you talked with Mary Crane there were no gaps in the understanding , no moments when it one side or the other there was bewilderment and sometimesp152even resentment . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of farmers to go down before the hopeless conditions of the New Day , the Millennium of Prosperity . She was the last of the " hired girls . " All the rest were servants , and none of them could have fitted into the Colonel 's dream of an agricultural democracy . The stuff for Utopias was not in them , nor was the fault their own as individuals . The other girls came from the Town itself , from those parts so remote , spread out in the shadow of Trefusis Castle , over the marshes and the surrounding terra firma . They were the new parts of the Town and they went by two or three names . There were the Flats , the Syndicate , and the Additions , and their nucleus was the area taken over by factories , blast furnaces , and rolling-mills . The Flats were the oldest of them all . They covered the area of the marshes and the bordering flatland , where , among the furnaces and mill yards there still lingered a few old houses built half a centuryearlier by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise and smoke became intolerable . Most of them were ugly wooden houses with vast piazzas , and the passing of the years and increasing neglect had not made them any more beautiful . Long ago they had been painted in " wearing " shades of chocolate brown or slate gray , and over these dead colors the rain and soot had superimposed long streaks of black . When the owners deserted them they were converted into rookeries for immigrants and never painted again . Dining-rooms and parlors were divided by partitions into cubicles , and houses which once sheltered families of nine or ten in the old heavy elegance of the nineteenth century now sheltered fifty or sixty men , women , and children living in the industrial squalor of the early twentieth . On Whitmore Street four of them in a row had been changed into brothels . They had a sinister fascination for Johnny , and sometimes in summer , when he drove through the Flats on his way to Trefusis Castle , he saw slatternly women clad in flowered wrappers , rocking and screaming at one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to know many kinds of ugliness , but none that was more uncompromising and abandoned than he hideousnessp153of the Flats . Long ago the old shade trees had died in that atmosphere of soot and carbon dioxide , but instead of being cut down and mercifully removed from sight , they remained to contribute their share to the desolation . In the old dooryards behind the rotting wooden fences , the grass turned yellow and died , until where once there had been a green lawn there was only trampled patches of yellow clay littered with old newspapers , tin cans , and even garbage . Whatever sanitary arrangements had once existed soon became clogged and abandoned , and the immigrant tenants , pleased to he free of such civilized affectations , set up makeshift privies in the desolate back gardens . Once , on his way to visit Greataunt Jane , during an epidemic of typhoid fever , Johnny passed through streets where the sewage and bedpans of the ancient rookeries had been dumped into the open gutters . Sometimes in the spring , behind one of the rotting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cluster of sickly blossoms . Occasionally certain women of the Town , moved by indignation , set about cleaning up the district . The brothels were suppressed for a few weeks and the dooryards were cleared of their litter , but beneath the surface everything remained the same , and in a month or two the brothels opened once more and the dooryards looked as dreary as ever . The courageous women had no votes and they had no business men to support them . The business men were too busy . It was the moment when America 's prosperity was moving toward its peak and it did not matter what happened to the animal population which was being imported by shiploads to make wheels turn and fill the pockets of the men who were building turreted houses on the other side of the Town , as far as possible from the Flats ; nor did it matter to those other men who had gone to the East to live in palaces furnished by picture dealers and to buy what they wanted in Washington . Privilege was everything . The class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . Even the panic of 1907 did not jar their sense of infallibility for long . There were always excuses to be found for clay feet . They are still finding them . The Syndicate was a part of the Town which lay beyond the Flatsp154to the north on the side of the open country . It got its name from a syndicate of citizens who with the rise of the mills bought up a dozen farms and made rudimentary streets which were no more than paths of mud , and built match-box rookeries to house the newly arrived immigrants . The whole affair was a speculation contrived with the smallest possible investment , to yield the largest possible return , and the objects of the exploitation were the mass of workmenarriving each ( lay and each week from the old country . The usual procedure was to rent a house to a steady worker who had already been in the country for a few years and spoke a little English . So long as the rent was paid  --  and a good fat rent it was , too  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tenant in his turn took in boarders , as many as he could squeeze into the dwelling , setting up mattresses side by side on the floors and even in the cupboards . Nearly always the lodgers worked in shifts , so that the same beds were occupied at night by one set of workers and during the day by another . At one period two of these houses came into the possession of ' Johnny 's father for a short time and Johnny was allowed to go with him occasionally to collect the rents . The tenants knew that the owner objected to overcrowding and always they kept some member of the family on watch throughout the day on which the rent was due . 1 When Johnny and his father arrived they sometimes saw a whole procession of men moving out of the back door of the house to disappear among the neighboring dwellings . When they entered there was every sign of bustle and excitement and one caught glimpses of mattresses stuffed hastily into cupboards or tossed down the cellar steps out of sight , and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just finished ten or twelve hours of grueling work had been roused from sleep and hurried out of sight . There was no time lost by them in dressing and undressing . In all the district there was perhaps not more than one woman to ' every fifteen men . From time to time the Town brothels were eitherclosed entirely in some transient wave of reform or closed against immigrant workmen upon the grounds that their presence excitedp155disorder , so that in the depths of their oppression even the most fundamental of human functions was stifled as far as it was possible . It did not matter that they slept in filth and were overworked and underpaid ; it did not matter that sometimes a single woman was the mistress of a half dozen men or that children were debauched and perversion common enough . It did not matter , because all these things were hidden . One could not hide brothels . The surface must he bright and moral , regardless of natural and human needs . Nothing must interfere with the business of making money . One must keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fundamentalprinciples . The Town was , after all , the child of New England . Johnny 's clearest memory of the Syndicate was of arriving with his father one winter evening after sundown to find one of the houses in immense confusion . In the darkness the lodger on guard had failed to notice the approach of the owner , and as Johnny and his father entered the house other lodgers were climbing out of windows and doors . The only ones left undisturbed were a dozen who had come in off the day shift at the mills and were round a table eating supper . They were all dark men , of every age , with enormous melancholy eyes . They were unshaven and covered with sweat and soot , and the smell in the room was nauseating . The whole supper was an enormous common bowl of soup filled with bread from which they all dipped with huge ladles , sucking the soup with loud animal noises . Johnny was only nine or ten years old at the time aid the sight of them terrified him . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women and children had all been massacred a few years earlier . It is tragic to return from the fields to find that your wives and children have been massacred , but ' l am not certain that men Johnny saw seated around the table had exchanged their old life for a heater one . Even in the new country they saw their wives and childrenstarve in time of strike . They saw them beaten and shot . For a Russian serf , either under the Tsarist regime or under the worst conditions of Soviet rule , life was scarcely more miserable than forp156the immigrant workman in " free " America during its great industrialgrowth . It would , I think , be impossible for men to have lived under worse conditions of oppression , economic , political , or spirit. , ual , than the immigrants of the Flats and the Syndicate . They died of epidemics and overwork , but it did not matter , because ships hurried back and forth across the Atlantic bringing fresh loads of fodder to be fed to mills and factories . The spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was even higher . It was , I think , almost one hundred per cent . The Town , the County , the State , the whole nat ion were destined to pay for the spiritual slaughter , and neither Johnny nor Johnny 's children will live to see the end of the retribution . But it did not matter then  --  the business men were making money and because they made money the shopkeepers ' tills were full each evening . That was the important thing . That was why men like Aldrich and Lodge and Smoot sat in Washington making certain that no one should interfere with the business men . The privileged ruled and took the profits . Men like Frick grew rich and filled houses with Fragonards and Vermeers . Business bribed and stole and corrupted . One dared not interfere with business and prosperity . Neither Johnny nor his father , nor old Jamie , in his indignation , understood the spectacle , because they knew nothing about " business " and there had never been any " business men " in their family . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed , too , because it was beyond the comprehension or credulity of any simple man . It was not until Johnny was grown and had left the Town forever that he came to understand it and to see that it was a strange compound of dishonesty and sharp dealing , of stupidity and ruthlessness and bribery , shot through with rare occasional flashes of genius . For half his life he stood in awe of big business , thinking that big-business men had some quality or genius which set them ahead of other men . It was only when he began to grow middle-aged that he understood the whole picture and saw that a man needed only mild shrewdness , vitality , and a lack of scruples to have succeeded in. that new world where every element contributed to help him . Luckp157was on his side , and opportunity and a government which he owned . Perhaps the American people , preferring wealth to decency , were his greatest allies . When he was forty Johnny knew that what he had seen in the Flats was only a tiny corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the mean instincts of the unscrupulous village shopkeeper . But Johnny never forgot for the rest of his life the Flats and their tragic inhabitants , nor the look in the eyes of those haunted , exploited Bulgarians ladling soup greedily out of the bowl in the middle of the table . Since the less than a hundred years had passed . The black slavery which troubled the old philosopher and his son-in-law Jamie was gone forever , but something else had taken its place , worse in the fundamental greed of its motives . Old Jamie himself thought the slaves had been happier and better treated than the workers in the mills . The people in the Flats were untouchables and so one never saw them . They never entered the life of that comfortable prosperous world save as a dim , distant cloud upon the horizon which was always there , menacing , like the cloud which threatens all the day given over to a picnic . But above them , of a higher caste , were the Jews and the Germans and the Irish whose children one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in politics sometimes crossed the paths of the Brahmins in the old houses beneath the elms or the Bunyas who lived in the monstrosities beyond the Sherman Place . In that changing world there was no prejudice against Jews . One sat beside them in school and sometimes they came to supper and id-ten enough to play in the vacant lots or in the skeletons of houses in the process of construction . If you were aware of anything which set the Jews apart from yourself , it was a difference in tradition , for the rich , colorful , sensual tradition of the Jews was doubly exotic against the thin , meagre background of that transplanted New Englandtown . As a child , Johnny knew that the Jews observed Saturdayp158as their Sunday and that on Friday nights some of them placed candles in the window , and he knew , too , that in one or two of the Jewish houses which he entered there was a richness which elsewhere one seldom encountered  --  a richness of food , of custom , of music , of books , of hospitality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thrift , of barrenness which was so prevalent in the Town , even in the houses of men as rich as the peddler Bentham 's grandson . When one went to play in a Jewish house one found it filled to overflowing with warmth and kindliness . One never left without receiving a gift , sometimes a worn toy to which you had taken a fancy , sometimes a bouquet of flowers for your mother , sometimes a piece of apfelstrIu/el , still warm from the oven and richscentedwith spices . In the plate-glass , fake Byzantine pretentiousness of the Bentham house , there was an atmosphere of desolation , a kind of life in death which in childhood Johnny could not have analyzed even if he had attempted it . At the Benthams , the furniture was never worn or scratched and it always sat in the same place . The shades were drawn in mid-summer " to save the carpets . " You could not play boisterously for fear of damaging the chairs . Long afterward he came to understand what it was that blighted that whole household . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in his pack from New England as surely as he had brought bone buttons and " fine silk for gentlemen 's waistcoats . " Long afterwardJohnny found it again in New England houses , again and again  --  meanness and thrift , security and fear . It was never like that in a Jewish household . There was another difference of which he was aware  --  that Jewish children did not play as wildly as the other children in the Town . They were always a little shy and self-conscious , as if they were afraid of putting themselves forward or were oppressed by an indefinablemelancholy , as if nine hundred years had passed since they had been able to play like other children . If there was no prejudice against Jews , there was an immense one against Roman Catholics , and under that head were lumped all the Irish , for in that world you were not considered Irish , no matter what ' . '  |p159blood  you might have , if you were not a Roman Catholic . An Irish Roman Catholic was something to be feared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunken and disorderly and the Roman Catholics were all servants of the Pope and traitors to every country which gave them shelter . The feeling permeated the whole life of the Town . As a small boy Johnny encountered it in the livery stables , the **25;2002;TOOLONG , the police station  --  wherever idle citizens gathered to chat . And now and then as a boy , he found lying about in livery stables copies of a newspaper called The Menace which was filled with stories of rapes by Roman Catholic priests and whole illegitimate families born to nuns . It was a paper which served , I suspect , a double purpose  --  that of providing an unlimited amount of salacious reading under the virtuous guise of an attack upon the Scarlet woman of Rome . There was no Roman Catholic church in the Town until the Irish came in with the railroads . The first edifice was a simple enough structure , a mere shack , replaced by a brick structure , but during Johnny 's childhood , the Catholics built an enormous handsomeRomanesque structure of Indiana limestone which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of worship . I think that most of the ignorant and prejudiced citizens of the Town looked upon St. Vincent 's as an affront and a piece of arrogance and their resentment gave rise to an outburst of feeling and to new sets of incredible and dirty stories . It was said that there was a secret passage connecting the house of the priest with the convent a block away , so that he might visit the nuns at his convenience , and that the cellar of the church was filled with arms to be used when the Pope gave the signal for an uprising which was to subdue the whole country and bring it beneath his power . There would have been in these stories the fantastic humor which ; ouches the preposterous but for the fact that hundreds and even housands of people in the County really believed them . When Johnny was a small boy the murders and violence , often enough justified , of the Molly Maguires , were still only a little way off and over the Flats there still hung the shadow of brutal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Mollies and members of a fiercely anti-Catholic organization called the American Protective Association . For Johnny the stories had a sinister and foreign character which made the dark alleys and the houses where the crimes had occurred seem doubly fearsome . Those assassinations and mob attacks , secret and often cowardly , seemed as unreal and as exotic as the dark stories of Renaissance Italy which he sometimes read , terrified , by candlelight in the sewing room . It was all very puzzling to a boy who was a grandson of the bluff and straightforward Jamie , for the old Scot , with all his hatred of priests , never forgot that even Roman Catholics were human . Johnny puzzled his head too in a desperate effort to reconcile families like the O'Sheas and the Siegfrieds with the livery stable tales of plots and rapes and assassinations . The O'Sheas , he knew , because Esmond O'Shea was a Democrat and one of his father 's stoutest henchmen in the wards on the wrong side of the Town where the Irish lived . They were a family whose beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Heaven for all the crimes attributed to Roman Catholics at the most rabid conferences held under the sycamore trees in front of Robinson 's livery stable . Esmond O'Shea himself was a man of forty , with black hair and blue eyes , spare and finely built with a mouth which curled up at the corners . Around his bright eyes there were little crows feet which came from much laughing . He had very beautiful hands of which he was proud and a laugh which passed through a room like an epidemic . He had come to America as a boy and when he was twentytwohe sent to Cork for his two younger sisters . Esmond had married when he was twenty-one and by the time he was forty he had eight children . About a visit to the O'Sheas there was all the quality of a lark and for Johnny there was no better treat than the privilege of driving across Town on a summer evening to call on Esmond O'Shea and talk politics . The O'Shea children were allowed to stay up late and only went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at " Run-sheep-Run " or " Duck on Rock " up and down the block underp161the street lights . Sometimes one of Esmond 's sisters came in for the evening and brought her children . There was a merry happy-goluckyair about the household which Johnny never encountered elsewherein the Town . The O'Sheas , like his own people , were poor but it never seemed to trouble them , perhaps because , living in the wrong part of Town , they had no appearances to keep up and no pretenses to make . Beneath the lack of respect for material success which colored the whole life in Johnny 's family , there was always the desperate , tragi-comic strain of gentility . The O'Sheas simply enjoyed life and let the Devil take the hind-most . They were not brought up to gentility , yet they had charming manners and all the generosity of the reckless . But underneath their gaiety and their wildness there lay tragedy , for the whole family was touched by tuberculosis . The mother was already dead and the oldest son could do no work . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Catholic cemetery . The O'Sheas , from Esmond who was one of his father 's best friends , to little Michael , who was six when Johnny was ten , were hard indeed to reconcile with the stories of Catholics which appeared in The Menace . For Johnny they provideddelights so ecstatic that when at last he left them to return to the right part of Town for his own respectable bed , he was overcome on the way home by a profound feeling of melancholy and depression . At ten years old he did not understand it , but when he was a man he looked back upon that indefinable deflation of the spirit and understood that it was born of envy and of a feeling which no child who grew up in the shadow of New England and Scotch Calvinism would ever escape  --  the feeling that there was something wrong and sinful in enjoying oneself too hilariously . The O'Sheas , even in the shadow of death , never knew that feeling . The Siegfrieds also lived in a wrong part of Town but not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their quarter was merely nondescript and colorless , neither fantastic and spectacular like the houses of the newly rich nor mysterious and sinister like the Flats . Nobody from the right part of Town ever knew exactly who the people were who lived out by the cemetery nor how they gainedp162their living . They were simply a vague amorphous mass , all save the . Siegfrieds who occupied an enormous house with a big lawn on which there were cast iron fountains and grottos made of cement with imitation stalactites covered with moss and tiny ferns . When Johnny was a boy they were rich and still possessed the profits of an oil business which was squeezed out of existence by the lawless operations of the pious Rockefeller octopus . It was a business built up by Johann Siegfried ; after the had come from Germany during the troubles of Forty Eight and the loss of it broke his heart , for he was very proud of leaving come to America a penniless revolutionary student , to make his own way up to wealth . He died of it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big house with their children . The Siegfrieds had two great handicaps in the society of the Town . They were Roman Catholics and they lived out by the cemetery and save for music Johnny might never have known them , for they did not meddle in politics . Wherever music was concerned the Siegfrieds were not to be ignored . They it was  --  Louis Siegfried and his old maid sister Bertha  --  who provided most of the guarantee fund wheneverany good musician or orchestra came to the Town . And in that world music had a hard struggle , for it was in the blood of few of those who dwelt in the turreted houses . Slowly as they raised themselves a little above the peddler stage , they came to see that a taste for music was a sign of civilization and more than that , that it was a social asset , and then their pockets were loosened a little ; but when Johnny was having his introduction to Mozart and Brahms , music was left to the Siegfrieds and a few people without money like poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a good piano . The inside of the Sicgfrieds ' house was different from that of any other house in the Town . There were tapestries and a great deal of carved wooden furniture and oil paintings , very sentimental most of them but very beautiful to Johnny 's eye , of South German meadows blue with cornflowers and peasant girls and cattle standing in pools . It was a heavy richness which was strange in the Town , even in ap163house like Trefusis Castle . And in the parlor there were two superb grand pianos , at one of which Johnny 's sister sometimes played symphonies and concertos with Johann or Bertha Siegfried at the other . When Johnny was old enough he was allowed sometimes to go to the Siegfrieds in the evenings to listen to the musk . All the Siegfrieds , including the children who were old enough , played two or three instruments and among them with the aid of Johnny 's sister they were able to arrange trios and quartets and quintets . Very often they came to play in the Willingdon 's small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was still too small to go out in the evenings , went to sleep to the quartets of Schumann , Mozart and Brahms and sometimes , an experience even more wonderful , he was wakened slowly in the night by the sounds of the music belowstairs , coming distantly to his bedroom . Then he would lie awake , listening , in the magical realm between consciousness and slumber , with the agreeable melancholy pleasure of imagining that he had died in his sleep and was awakening in Paradise . Sometimes , if he did not fall asleep again too quickly , he became a spectator at his own death and funeral , seeing himself lying in his coffin with his face washed and an angelic smile already on his lips . And he watched his aunts and uncles and the neighbors as they walked past and heard them say , " He looks as if he had just fallen asleep . Perhaps he 's better off than the rest of us . Think of all the trouble he 's missed , " and , " Probably he 's with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said he had bad table manners and his mother would be sorry for all the times she had punished him . Unconsolable and dressed all in black , she would say , " If I 'd only known that God meant to take him from us so soon , I 'd have let him go to the round house or go swimming or anything . " Sometimes under the stimulationof Mozart or Brahms the scenes at the funeral became so moving that even Johnny found a lump in his throat and tears in his eyes . Music and drowsiness provided a wonderful release to the imagination . There was a double pleasure in going to the Siegfrieds ' great house overlooking the cemetery , for there was not only the mystical pleas/ure of the music but there was also the material one of a big South German supper of cold meat , sardines , sandwiches , sausages , sweets , beer and cider . The Siegfrieds were a handsome family , big in the Wagnerian way . Louis Siegfried who was middle-aged had brown eyes and blonde hair and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Brahms was his hero . Miss Bertha , who was a spinster of thirty-eight and always dressed in black with a high collar held up by whale bones , thought Brahms alternately too academic and too overwhelmingly emotional . She had a theory that as a man he had not lived enough and so the emotions he suppressed sometimes gut out of hand and ran away with him in his music . She preferred the more stern and ordered beauties of Bach and in her more emotional moments the pure , lovely baroque of Mozart . Mrs. Brandt , the married sister , was a romantic and loved Schumann . It was the Siegfrieds who set Johnny 's feet on the paths which long afterward led him to Munich and Salzburg and Vienna and it was the Siegfrieds who helped him to understand the ultimate glories of German music . It was perhaps due to them that almost all other music would forever sound thin and artificial and trivial by comparison . They were a charming and sympathetic family , as different from the O'Sheas as it was possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface and brilliant and that of the Siegfrieds had to be explored . Perhaps of the two it was the more profound and lasting . The charm of the O'Shea family left nothing behind once you were out of their presence . The charm and the memories of the Siegfrieds , their music and their heavy suppers , was destined to endure forever . Long afterward when Johnny had passed by and finished with adolescent cynicism , he came to guard and cherish even their sentimentality . The " hired girls " for all the Town came out of the Flats and the Syndicate bearing unpronounceable names and still sometimes clad in innumerable petticoats . They spoke little English and could be had for a few dollars a month , and the sudden change from thep165squalor of the Flats even to the comfort of a modest lower middleclasshouse worked strange results . When first they came they were dirty as they had to be , and surly , which vas not surprisinsr . And some of them were dishonest , having already imbibed a little of that lawless philosophy which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly from the idea that in this new " free " country small dishonesties would go unpunished , and a little , perhaps , from what they had heard of the lives of the men who owned the mills and factories . Once a week they returned to the Fiats to spend an hour or two with their families , and on these occasions they bore off in the pockets of their voluminous petticoats eggs and sugar and delicacies which had no place in the meals of the dreadful rookeries . Sometimes they even made off with valuable articles which later they attempted to sell . Some of them did it with a kind of wide-eyed innocence , and were astonished and hurt when they were sent away or threatened with punishment , and always they had excuses . A silver pitcher was scratched or a tablecloth had been darned and therefore no one who lived in a fine house could have any use for them . Nearly always they took away , like magpies , articles that were less useful than dazzling . In the Town they were an institution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or more of them  --  clumsy , hulky peasant girls with great legs and arms , cowlike and rather stupid , wellmeaningbut undependable , and often enough without morals of any kind . Frequently in their direct , animal simplicity they came into conflict with the standards of those solid middle-class houses , filled with families of Methodists and Baptists so fanatically strict that they would not suffer the melancholy strains of a concertina played on the back porch after nightfall by some lover come up from the Flats into the respectable part of the Town to court one of the " hired girls . " Frequently they were cruelly treated and made to sleep in cupboards or in the cellar , for in a good many households " Hunkies " and " Polaks " were regarded as a little less worthy of comfort than the family dog . On one occasion Johnny 's mother becameinvolved in a neighborhood feud because she dared to rescue ap164Czechoslovak girl called Eppa who for weeks had been sleeping on a piece of carpet on the back porch of one of the near-by churchgoingladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class of " hired girl " by being too soft with them .

But even Johnny 's mother , who was good and generous and armed with her father 's fathomless capacity for moral indignation , never felt quite the same toward these immigrant girls as she felt toward the girls like Mary Crane or the Negresses who were so much a part of the Town life and were looked upon always with affection .

The roots of the lawlessnessin the big turreted houses were embedded in greed . There was in the Town another sort of servant , more numerousp168than the vanishing " hired girls " of American stock , but infinitely less common than the immigrant girls from the Flats . These were the Negresses who had abilities and a character and position all their own . There were a great many of them , the children and grandchildrenof the escaped slaves who had swarmed through the County in the days when old Jamie and Job Finney and ( ; reataunt Martha were " conductors " on the " Underground Railroad . " On the eve of the Civil War a good many of them had stayed in the Town , protected by abolitional sentiment , troubling to go no farther ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the place , returned from Canada . In this town which had never known slavery there was a whole colony of Negroes with its own shops , its own music , its own social life , and its own African Methodist Episcopal church . To the white population the colony bore a relation wholly different from that which existed between the two races in the South or between those in communities like Harlem which grew up out of the great northward emigration of Negroes in the ' nineties and the early part of the twentieth century . The tradition of slavery had never existed . On the contrary , this essentially New England community had been trained to look upon the Negro as a fellow citizen liberated from bondage . There lingered much of the old sentimental , slightly hysterical , humanitarian spirit of the abolitionists , and the Negroes themselves by their very character roused a feeling of affection which the alien immigrants never knew . In the days of Reconstruction , when the Republicans waved the bloody shirt up and down the State , politicians had even been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a white man and that some of them were superior . By the time Johnny was born , no politicianany longer made such statements , and there had entered into the relationship between the two races a patronizing sense of goodnaturedsuperiority on the part of the whites . The little colony on Otis Avenue had been there for nearly half a century and their history had been a peaceful one . There was no case of miscegenation and there had never been the faintest suspicion of an attack upon a white woman and only one or two cases of quarrels between menp169of the two races . A bad nigger called Tom Scott had murdered an old couple named Barnes for their money which gossip had it was hidden in their house . He was hanged in the jailyard in the year 1874 . But four white men had been hanged in the same jailyard for similar crimes . The little colony had become not only a part of the Town , but in a curious way necessary to it . It was a part of the life and the color of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the War of the Secession there was a close bond with the Negro colony which had persisted through two or three generations . At Trefusis Castle the stables were always full of nigger boys of all ages . Most of the men supported their families by working as butlers or gardeners or coachmen , and the women worked sometimes as laundresses and caterers and " accommodators , " but the Negroes who worked regularly as domestic servants were a rarity . One saw them everywhere and some among them became close friends . There were : t half-dozen who fixed themselves in the memory of Johnny forever . Aunty Walker was rich and had a house with a big garden outside the Negro quarter on Elm Street . She had money made out of a catering business which had engaged her energies for forty years until she retired at last , a capitalist , to live upon her income . She was an octoroon who must have been handsome in her youth , with the slow , beautiful animal charm which many octoroons possess . With her the charm had persisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw her she had countless wrinkles and grizzled hair . She had great intelligence and during a lifetime of hard work had educated herself by reading in her spare time , and like old Jamie , whose education had been cut short in his youth , she had a reverenceamounting to awe for books . For the merry and undignified antics of the other Negroes who were members of the African Methodist Church she had an attitude of good-natured condescension . She herself was the only colored member of the important and fashionable Congregational Church . The Civil War is a long way off now and the passion which moved the Abolitionists has faded , so that it is difficult any longer to understand that there was a time when the members of thatp170church regarded the presence of Aunty Walker in their midst as a sign of grace and honor and distinction . She had her own pew and on the occasion of the great church suppers it was Aunty Walker , experienced as a cateress , who took charge of the hi ; kitchen with its rows of spotless pans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood managing such affairs and I think she regarded her task as the hit she might contribute toward the work of the Kingdom of I leaven . She was amiable and gentle , with a loud laugh which one could hear all the way from the kitchen to the distant assembly-room , and from her the white women of the church took their orders . She had no children and no relatives , having lost all trace of her family during the confusion which followed the Civil War , but she had a passion for children and spoiled them when they went into the church kitchen before the hour for serving supper . She fed them with bits of cake and even dishes of ice cream passed with a secret chuckle out of the back window while mothers and aunts were not looking . When she died she left all her little fortune to establish a library for the children of the Sunday school , uniting in this final act her love for children and her reverence for books . Her picture , an enormous enlarged photograph taken when she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framed in oldfashionedgilt , almost the last reminder of the days when to be a Congregationalist was to be an Abolitionist , almost the only memento of the days when the Town and the County were bitterly divided into Abolitionists and Copperheads . So long as the church exists the picture will hang there and Aunty Walker will be remembered by the Children 's Library , which each year grows a little larger on the benefice of the little fortune she left a long time ago . It was due to Aunty Walker that Johnny discovered at the age of eight or nine the limitless beauty of the Greek and Norse Mythologies and later the sober splendor of Plutarch 's Lives . The library and Aunty Walker and the First Congregational Church were profoundly Americanand profoundly New England . And there was Miss America , who was a beauty specialist longp171before the days of Elizabeth Arden and I-lcicna Rubenstein . She was a tiny , very black Negress with an enormous mouth and a wide smile which revealed two rows of shining gold teeth . ' these and her fine kinky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washed the hair and massaged the faces of the ladies in the Town , and one might meet her on the streets at any hour of the day , accompanied by her mongrel terrier , hurrying along on her short legs and carrying a little bag which contained her toilet preparations . She was always hurrying , for she was in great demand not alone , I suspect , for her services as manicurist and shampooer , but for her talents as a gossip . She was the Saint Simon of the Town and always brought with her a long catalogue of news and gossip which she had collectedon her rounds . She knew everybody and everything which had happened in the Town and she always had more details , sometimes , I suspect , fictional , than anyone else . She carried about with her the faint aroma of a witch doctor , for her creams and lotions were concocted of herbs and simples according to secret formulas which could not have been dragged from her by wild horses . What her name really was , or whether she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor did anyone else . Howevershe came by it , she was christened long before the days of internationalbeauty contests . On her rounds she was always accompanied by a dog as black and as merrily ugly as herself . It must have been of a fabulous age , for , so far back as anyone could remember , she never had any other . When Miss America arrived in the house life became a little more exciting . When there was a wedding of importance , the bride was given into the hands of Miss America to he shampooed and manicured and made ready for the sacrifice . It was Miss America who helped the bride into her wedding dress , pinning it in here , letting it out there , standing off to survey the product of her skill , flashing her wide grin of ebony and gold while she made clucking sounds of admiration . Miss America was supposed to understand " chic , " and for forty years she groomed every bride in the Town and went with her in the cab to the church . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was respectably married without the expert aid of Miss America . But best of all was Big Mary . She was as huge a Negress as Miss America was small . She was taller than the six feet two inches of Johnny 's father , and she was generous in her proportions . She must have weighed nearly three hundred pounds . She was a black Venus Genetrix , for she was a handsome woman and had countless children and grandchildren , so many that it was impossible to know them all or to keep their individualities separate . Some of them were named for Greek divinities , and in his childhood Johnny played with two pig-tailed goddesses called Juno and Athena . Big Mary and her capable daughters never worked out regularly . They belonged to the aristocratic and expensive category of domestic servants known as " accommodators . " Whenever a servant left or there was need of extra help at a funeral or a wedding or a family reunion Big Mary and her daughters were called upon , and they came good-humoredly but with a certain amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed , but no amount of money could bribe them to sink from the level of " accommodators " to that of ordinary servant . With her childrenand grandchildren Big Mary constituted a whole catering establishment . They were all excellent cooks and laundresses and as good in one sort of crisis as in another , but best of all they were all big , strong , good-natured sensible women whose presence added gaiety to the household whether the occasion of their ministration was a wedding or a funeral . Her daughters went wherever they were summoned , but Big Mary as she grew older chose her places and would go only to the families for whom she had a fancy . Luckily , she had a fancy for Johnny 's mother , and so whenever there was a funeral or a wedding she would come in and take charge . She was not an economical servant , for she cooked in the lavish manner and tradition of the old South and herself had a gargantuan appetite which needed a whole chicken at a meal to satisfy it , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which meant that when her work was finished she had a right to carry home with her all the vegetables and fruitand potatoes she could " tote . " As she was a big woman of enormous physical strength , I think that perhaps she held the record of all time for " totage . " When she came to work she arrived in clean gingham with a clean bandana tied around her head , and her arrival meant that so long as she stayed the family would feast upon delicious and indigestibledelicacies covering the whole range of the . Southern kitchen . But for the children the range of her delights was not confinedmerely to food . She had an inexhaustible collection of songs , stories , and legends which she poured out lavishly while she worked . Unlike most cooks , she did not banish the children from her kitchen ; on the contrary , she welcomed them , and as long as he lives Johnny will remember the big kitchen filled with children eating cookies and listening to Big Mary talk or sing while she mashed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen became an enchanted place . It was always said that Big Mary was the child of a Negress slave and a plantation owner , but Big Mary never gave out any hint as to her descent , although she did admit owning six hundred acres of land on the borders of West Virginia and a whole village from which she drew rents . But she was an absentee landlord and never visited her property . She need not have worked , but she did so , I think , out of primitive wisdom and a liking for a contact with human affairs . She understood the value of things in life and appreciatedthe happiness which came out of her own peculiar position , a position in which she was honored and respected . She knew , I think , that the position grew out of the old Abolitionist traditions of the Town , and that her relation to the white people of the Town was a peculiar one , which could never exist in the South nor in the cities to which the " new niggers " were migrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's family intimately , being associated in all its major joys and sorrows . I think there was nothing which one concealed from Big Mary , for , unlike Miss America , she was not a gossip . And she was aware that there were occasions when her advice was sought , and that her wisdom and experience had a value . X173p174But she stood in this position not alone to one family which would have implied a kind of servitude , but to half a dozen . Johnny went to school for the first time when he was not yet six years old . It was a big budding , square and built of red brick and only a few years old , for it was one of the monuments of the growth and progress of the Town . It was a simple building , neither ugly nor beautiful , but it had an engaging look such as many plain women have . It was the Fourth Ward school and in the scale of the Town growing snobbery the Fourth Ward meant something . It was in the Fourth Ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expression " important family " came to mean " rich family , " or perhaps more exactly " successful family , " for the word " success " had come to have but a single shade of meaning . It meant " rich . " But the Fourth Ward was not only the most prosperous one . It was on the right side of the railroad tracks and as far removed as possible from the Hunkies and Polaks , the smoke and the filth of the Flats . It included the John Sherman Place and those rows of turreted structures being erected constantly by the newly successful . It was the district which became more and more " the place to live . " But when Johnny was a small boy , there was still strength in the old democratic tradition and everybody went to the grade schools and the high schools . Fashionable boarding-schools and rich Eastern colleges , if they were ever spoken of at all , were still regarded a little as institutions of some foreign country . The commercial-industrial ' junto was still feeling its way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rather half-baked . No one had begun to talloudly of the valuable contacts in business and society which a boy , might make while attending an Eastern boarding-school or college , Education had not yet come to be looked upon largely as a stepping stone to new opportunities for selling bonds and making financial alliances . One was not likely to go to college unless he went seeking an education . Already there were signs of a change . There were boys who went to college because they were good football-players , .  |p175and  others who went because it would be a help in business , and even one or two , like the great-grandson of Bentham , the peddler , who were sent by parents who were looking toward Washington and the East and thought it a good thing for their son to meet the sons of other " important " people like themselves . But on the whole young men usually went to college in order to lay up for themselves a treasure or to fortify themselves against whatever disappointments and tragedies life might bring . The idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large part of the Town long criticised Greataunt Jane with bitterness because she sent her six daughters to the East and later to Paris , where they learned to speak French and paint watercolorsof bowls of fruit and flowers . As a child of that world one played alike with the children of the rich and of the laundress and the immigrant gardener and sometimes with the grandchildren of black Big Mary . That much remained of the Colonel 's democratic dream , but that little was already fading . In a little time when wealth grew a little more self-conscious there would be an effort by rich men and their wives to segregate their children . They would seek to make them believe that because they were born rich they were also horn of a superior caste , and in the attempt they would surround them with the trappings of aristocracy , with motors and antique furniture and pictures bought from shrewd dealers , and so bring on the first step in the famous American progression from shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves . All too often there would be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which make a shabby enough disguise . In Johnny 's childhood the men , and especially the women , who lived in the ugly houses along Maple Avenue were already growing restless and uneasy because so much money set them apart so little from the people on the wrong side of the railroad tracks . But the Fourth Ward was still a fairly democratic American community , following directly the line of an old and honorable tradition , and still almost uncorrupted by a desire to imitate the East and Europe . It was still a small world which sought to imitate no other and was still content to stand upon its own.  |p176If  Johnny had been a supernaturally clever child he would have found all about him on the playground of the Maple Avenue school the seeds of the change which was to come so quickly . They were the children who played with him day after day when classes were finished . They existed already in the brains of the spinsters who taught them and in the parents to whom they returned after school hours . Surrounding the schoolhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass was worn away by the feet of the children playing at recess time . On school days beneath the trees there was much shouting and screaming and laughter , and one might have stood watching the spectacle thinking all sorts of sentimental banaliticsabout youth and children and gaiety . The surface looked all right . It was only underneath that one came upon the rottenness , the cruelty , and the heartbreak . Long afterward , when Johnny had come to know many kinds of cruelty in the world , he never discovered any worse than he had found on the playground which surrounded the Maple Avenue school . Because he was awkward and shy and bad at games he came in for a good share of it himself , but what he suffered was nothing by the side of some of the others . He came of an old and respectable and outwardly prosperous family , and so he was never an outsider and the hardships he suffered were nothing extraordinary and did him no harm . There were times when his father was poorer than the German gardener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but few ever suspected it because his family was a thoroughly middle-class family and long ago had learned the American game of pretending to be richer than it was , even though the effort was at times desperate . Only once did Johnny know what it was like to be tortured on account of his poverty . It occurred one morning when he appeared at school in a pair of trousers cut down for him by his mother from an old pair of his father 's . They would have passed unnoticed save that instead of buttoning down the front they buttonedat the side . One boy made the discovery , and then another and another , until at last , in a corner of the school yard , he was stir/rounded by a mob of boys jeering at his homemade pants . There was more in their attack than the mere savagery of schoolboys . Somewherein their childish minds they were aware that not only was poverty a disgrace , but that poverty in one of their own kind was an unthinkable crime . Johnny never wore the pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torture which a dozen other children went through day after day in that school yard . Once or twice he defended one of the children when their torture rl went beyond endurance , but on the whole he accepted it and did Ij not at all understand what lay at the roots of it . Thirty years after he began to understand that what he witnessed was not simply a manifestation of childish cruelty which might have happened in any nation at any time ; he came to understand that it was American . IL was something which these children had picked up at home from i heir own fathers and sometimes from their own mothers . It was die shadow of a philosophy which often enough took the place of religion . It was the principal motive of existence in a good many of those families who sent their children to the Maple Avenue school . One had to be successful , no matter how success was achieved . One must make money , no matter how one came by it . The only hell was poverty and lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home those children were accustomed to hearing their parents j speak with reverence of Judge Wyant because he was rich , although they must have known that at the same time he was guilty of enough crimes to have kept him in prison for a lifetime . Bentham , the grandson of the peddler , who everyone knew was guilty of bribery and fraud and even perhaps of murder , was looked upon cynically as a clever fellow who knew how to get on in the world . The boys who played at recess under the maple trees of the Fourth Wardhoolhouse were a generation which was growing up to believe that Christ was the first business man and that God must be a banker or A broker . Their religion was profit and prosperity and for it they would be willing to sacrifice every other principle . Most of them never got beyond being members of Rotary Clubs and optimistic ( toasters in the Chamber of Commerce . In their small way they wereP178destined to go on and on , poorer in this life than the sons of the laundress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altar of wealth and privilege , flattered and oily , if one of the high priests deigned to drop them a word of recognition . It was not only the children in rags and cast-off shoes who suffered , but the immigrant children as well . If a child came to school who spoke with an accent he was set upon at once and tormented by all sorts of cruelties . Luckily , since the Fourth Ward was the " right place " to live , there were very few immigrant children in the school , but sometimes , since the dozen who went there were poor as well as foreign , they suffered from a double dose of cruelty . There was one boy called Herman who wore cast-off clothes and shoes given him indiscriminately by more prosperous families . They seldom fitted him and sometimes they were ragged at the elbows .. Most of one winter he had to wear a pair of women 's shoes with pearl buttons , run down at the heels , and these were seized upon as a special incentiveto torment . The small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , but when classes were over they followed him home , running all the way and pelting him with sticks or snowballs . Herman was guilty of no crime save t hat he was poor , and that because he could not speak English without an accent he did not conform . What has become of him I do not know , but he had every reason and every right to become an Anarchist- , a Communist , a Bolshevist . Perhaps he has become one and is still being pelted by little boys whose bodies have grown up and whose minds remain still capable of school-yard brutalities . They are st ill chasing Herman . In the day of the Colonel and even in old Jamie 's prime nonconformityhad never been a crime . Indeed , eccentricity had been admired and individuality encouraged . Men and women passed through middle age and grew old , mellowed in the possession of their own particular flavor . But by the time Johnny was born , nonconformitywas coming to be regarded as a dangerous thing . A person who behaved in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectable , was a danger not only to the State , but to Prosperity , which was far more important . Even a man who disclosedp181politicians . When I think of it now , it seems to me that more good would have been done if , instead of all the lies we were taught and the parrotings we were put through , there had been a large sign hung in each schoolroom with the words of Dr. Johnson , " Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel . " Certainly the loudest patriots in the world of Johnny 's childhood were also the greatest scoundrels . And the political bosses and the big business men who honored the flag and shouted the loudest at gatherings of veterans were at that moment stealing from the people at whom they shouted , sweating and red-faced , in shirt-sleeve oratory . The men , like Grandfather Willingdon 's friend , General Vandervelde , who had given his whole life to the welfare of his fellow citizens , never spoke of patriotism at all , or if they did so it was with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the incident of the pants occurred and he understood for the first time that his family was poor . All poverty is relative , and unless a man stands naked before his God there is always another man in the world who has fewer possessions . And so Johnny 's family was much better off than hundreds of others in the Town , but it suffered from perhaps the worst of all povertics -- the variety known as genteel . There were times when the family was even affluent , but most of the time Johnny 's parents had much less money than the people of their own small world . They lived well and were never without one horse and sometimes two or three in the stables , but in order to keep up a front it was necessary to deny themselves things which their friends had as a matter of course , and to make petty economies and makeshifts which were unceasingly annoying . Most of it was done in secret , but sometimes one of the family got caught out , as in the case of the homemade breeches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have kept up a bluff except that in that Town and in the then existing state of civilization in America it would have been impossible to have done otherwise . I think that if Alexander Hamilton had looked ahead he would have had the American dollar stamped with the motto , " Nothing succeeds like success . " It lies at the root of the average American 's incapacity top182understand and appreciate life , of his habit of living always to the . limit of his income and often beyond it . It lies , I think , at the root of the American passion for speculation , and for the abysmal helplessnessof the American in a financial depression  --  the American who does not own his own home , although he has his automobile  --  the American without enough saved to support his family for six months . One has to keep . up a false front , and a good many Americans worry themselves into the grave struggling to . maintain that bogus facade . And so Johnny 's family were always pretending to the world that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so bad when he was small , but as he grew older he became more and more aware o the strain . I think it was his mother who bore most of the burden of worry on her strong shoulders , for she was one of those made to worry and who , seeing a responsibility in the distance , ran to meet it and place it on her own shoulders . Her whole life was spent in , anticipation of calamity or in the expectancy of some stroke of : fortune which would make them all rich forever . Johnny 's father . was inclined to take things calmly ; at least one never saw any sign of the vagaries of life disturbing him , unless it was in the wild out  --  bursts of temper which sometimes seized him . The horror of tha respectable poverty colored all of Johnny 's childhood and left upo him marks which he was never able to destroy . As a man he camtolive from clay to day in horror of being poor , but at the same time : he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so in a wild effort to destroy those childhood impressions ; and h. acquired a horror of borrowing , and a terrible self-consciousness abou money which made it impossible for him to bargain , so that h always came out worst in every deal he ever undertook , and cool . never ask for the payment of a loan he had made . Even to talk al-mu money was painful to him.  | WHEN Johnny was seven years old he saw his grandfather Willingdonfor the first time . There had been a good deal of mystery before the old man actually appeared . It began with a letter which arrived one morning and was opened by Johnny 's father , who read it through to himself once , then twice , and handed it silently to his wife . She did not read it twice . She did not even read it through to the end , but tossed it into the middle of the breakfast table and said , " It 's come at last . " For the moment they said nothing more on the subject nor did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said he must be off to the office , but in the days which followed Johnny overheard them talking now and then and heard his mother say , " I ' suppose he can have Mary 's room , " for Mary Crane had just been married and because the family fortunes had gone into one of the periodic doldrums no " hired girl " had been engaged in her place . His father said , " Yes , I think that will suit him best . " And Johnny was left floundering in curiosity . For days he tried to imagine what his Grandfather Willingdon was like , but he could not make any progress with the puzzle , because he knew nothing at all about him .. No one had ever spoke of him . Johnny only knew that he was always traveling in some remote part of the earth and that two or three times a year a letter came addressed to his father in minute handwriting , and that sometimes the letter had foreign stamps on it . The last cite had come from San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was difficult to imagine Grandpa Willingdon because there was something about Grandpa Ferguson , some vigor of personality , whichin the way . For Johnny Old Jamie seemed the model of all grandfathers and whenever he tried to think what Grandpa Willing/don might be like , the figure of that huge muscular old man of eighty somehow obscured and blurred the picture . And then one morning Grandpa Willingdon arrived in the most unexpected of ways . The station express wagon from Thompson 's livery-stable stopped before the house laden with three big wooden boxes and a tin trunk , and on the wagon seat beside Ind Thompson rode a tall lean old maul with a pepper-and-salt beard . He was dressed rather like a preacher , in shabby black clothes and a wide-rimmed hat of black felt , with brilliant grim eyes which were so deep a blue that they appeared to he black . He was Grandpa Willingdon , the son of the Methodist and the Congregationalist , the child of Thomas and Marianna Willingdon . He had came home to die . The trunk was carried up into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxes were unpacked under the arbor in the back yard . They contained nothing but books , and whether they had accompanied the old man on his wanderings or whether they had been kept somewhere in storage no one ever discovered . Shelves were built in his room and they were carried up and put in order by the old man himself . They were to be his only companions for the rest of his life . It was not easy to receive him into the midst of that noisy family . The first greetings were cold and awkward , but the awkwardness never wore away even after the family had long grown accustomed to his presence . He was the strangest of strangers , but even if he had lived all his life in the ugly house , I think the relationship would have been no different . Johnny 's mother had seen him but once , and Johnny 's father had not seen him for seventeen years , but his strangenessarose not so much from his long absence and the mystery which surrounded him , as from the character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which appeared to incase him like a shroud of ice . It was ice which did not even melt in the ardor of a family which long ago had capitulated to the domination of that other grandfather , old Jamie.  |p185He  asked that he might have his meals in his room , and Johnny 's mother did not protest , for after he had had a half dozen meals with t lie family , she was delighted at the prospect of never having him again enter the dining-room . It was like having a ghost at the table . I le sat there cold and silent , save that once or twice during the meal he opened his thin lips to utter some bitter remark which chilled all the others as if a door had opened suddenly and a blast of icy air had come up out of some subterranean place . Arguments and even quarrels were frequent enough at the table , especially when the aunts and uncles were " visiting , " but they were hot-headed and wordy and usually concerned with politics , and suddenly they would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would return as if nothing had ever happened . But of cold bitterness and cynicism there had been none , for it was a family in which there were no doubts nor any talent for satire . The presence of Grandpa Willingdon was wrong , and even Johnny 's small brother felt it , although he could not possibly have understood it , and twice burst into tears for no reason at all , only calling out amid his wails , " I 'm frightened. ! I 'm frightened ! " while the old man glared fiercely at him . He came to be known as " The Old Man , " not only in the Town but in the family as well . There was , I think , nothing of disrespect i n the title . It was somehow appropriate and inevitable , like the names of Toby 's Run and Trefusis Castle . He was very straight and very lean and brittle and spry . Yet one had the impression that he was immensely ancient and had always been so , like the prophets of the Old Testament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having been young or gay . One could not imagine what it would have been like to hear him laugh . It would , I think , have been terrifying . If there was any shadow of contempt in the title " The Old Man , " it lay in the mystery which always surrounded him and in the knowledge that he had never worked at anything . In the opinion id the Town , the neighborhood , and even the family , a life withoutwork was a damned life . It was the old sin for which Dr. Trefusis had never been forgiven . From the day he arrived , eccentrically , upon the seat of the bag/gage-wagon instead of a cab , he was accepted by Johnny 's parents as a cross to be borne . He had written to announce that he was returning to make his home with them , inclosing no address which would have allowed a protest . There was nothing to be done . It was unthinkable that he should have been sent into an asylum , and impossible to have paid for his lodging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found who would support , at any price , the perpetual i hill of his personality and his strange disordered habits of life . BLit in the end the family came to accept him , and in the exile of his room above the kitchen , he became a part of the establishment . But there grew up about him a protective wall of tissue , such as the flesh builds up about foreign matter lodged within it . In that noisy overflowing house he was forever isolated . The children came to accept him as a phenomenon which had intrudedsuddenly within the borders of their existence . Blindly they felt his strangeness . They knew that he was old , but also that he was different from the other old people they knew . He was not like the great aunts who were always visiting , and he was as different as it was possible to be from Grandpa Ferguson . And after a time they came no longer to notice him any more than if he had been a new chimney on the house . It was only when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring at them that the old terror seized then . For none of them save Johnny did he ever show the faintest interest or affection . Johnny was the exception , and Johnny it was who carried his meals up the narrow dark back stairs and lighted his kerosene lamp at dusk . And slowly in Johnny there grew , up an impression and a memory of The Old Man which was destinednever to leave him . It was of a room smelling of kerosene and apples and dusty books and old age , and in the midst of it the squeaking of the rocking-chair in which The Old Man sat as the darkness fell and he waited for Johnny to light his lamp . He had a faint liking for Johnny , which embarrassed and troubled the boy , for it was not pleasant to have a ghost touch your head or ask you what you had learned in school . He responded , politely as he could , for he was well brought up , as a grandchild of old Jamie'sp187had to be , but there were times when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spite of everything , shrink away a little . And as he grew older he became dimly aware of something pitiful in the groping efforts of the lonely old man with the bitter brilliant eyes which made him ashamed that his body rebelled as if from death itself . As a child Johnny had no great curiosity about Grandpa Willingdon , nor any impulse to inquire into the reasons for the bitter loneliness of the old man , nor for his own feeling of distaste and even horror . But The Old Man became a part of him forever , fixed in his memory with a vividness which his agreeable memories of old Jamie never approached .. It was only after he was grown and had children of his own and there were moments when he felt The Old Man in his blood , that he began to wonder about him and to understand him a little through his own self . Twenty years after The Old Man died , he came to live again with a strange vividness in the memory and even in the blood of Johnny . It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other grandchildren because even then , on the evenings when Johnny climbed the dark stairs of " the back way " to light his lamp , he had been aware that in Johnny alone he would live on . In him mingled the hot blood of Jorge and Elvira van Essen and the cold sensuality of Thomas Willingdon , the New England emigrant , and it may have been that in his veins the two bloods con. -l ; ealed . He was the son whom the passionate Marianna had overwhelmedwith love , setting him against his father , pouring out upon him the affection for which she had no other outlet . She it was who kept his very soul in subjection all through his childhood and adolescence , using whatever means she found at hand . For she belonged to the unscrupulous women of the nineteenth century who , denied suffrage and divorce and sometimes even the rights of property , found weapons of their own to gain what they wanted in life . Like them , she could faint at will and summon to her aid the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intrigues ,  |p188even  setting her husband and her children against one another . She was capable of raising a hurricane of emotion which wore the nerves of others to rags and filled the whole house with unhappiness for days but somehow left her miraculously untouched , standing in the center of the storm , a martyr and a saint . But fate had sent her the one husband who was able to ride untouched and serene through tears and screams , through fainting-fits and hysterics , to emerge perfectlycalm and wholly cold with the remark , " Mrs. Willingdon has had another attack , " or " You had better go in and look after your mother ; she is beside herself again . " It was a hurricane wasting itself against a wall of flint , and when at last , baffled and furious , she gave up all hope of ever dominating her husband , she turned to her sort . When she began her attack he was a soft , rather timid boy , and - in the end she succeeded only in turning him into the flint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to die at last he was aman of sixty-five , but she had done something to him for which he never forgave her . He had the news of her approaching death in SanFrancisco and could have returned , but he wrote coldly that the journey was too long and , anyway , she might be dead before he arrived . But while he was still a boy he had loved her passionately , so deeply that he existed only in relation to her . He thought her the . most beautiful woman in the world and the most charming . He knew , like herself , that she was martyred , and he hated his father who lived in the same house , cold and aloof , untouched by th. emotional tempests which were forever sweeping over him . Marianna was a primitive woman , and her instinct must have been to save he son for herself and to keep him bound to her for as long as she , lived . She called him " My boy " with a glow of affection and tears in her eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to be despised and that girls were evil creatures with only on thought in their minds . Out of her Methodism and her own baffled passions she led him to believe that whatever had to do with love or sex was filthy . There was only one life which was pure and good.  |p189And  so , under her spell , he went off when he was seventeen to a Methodist seminary to become a preacher . He was a handsome youth , looking very like his father , the handsomeNew Englander with a head like a Greek bust , and in the picture taken the day he set out for the seminary the face is of a boy who knew nothing of the world . It is the face of a frail , emotionalboy of seventeen , touched by a look of unearthly purity and asceticism . It was the first time the two had ever been separated , and they wrote each other every day long emotional letters , his touched by naive religious sentiments and hers filled with insidious emotional phrases . She urged him " never to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up her life for him " and to remember that " in her sad persecuted existence he was all that she had in life . " A half dozen times during the first awful year of their separation she left home without warning and made him hysterical visits drenched with emotion . The second year at the seminary was easier for him , but he still remained dependent upon Marianna . One could see it in the letters which Johnny found long after The Old Man was dead . They were filled with doubts and timidity and homesickness , and here and there , most terrible of all , there were the faintest insinuations of his doubts of God Himself ; but Marianna , possessive , affectionate , determined , overwhelmed him with new outbursts , and for a little while the doubts would vanish , stifled more by her violence than by any change of belief . And then in the third year he discovered a friend . It was another boy come up from a farm to be a preacher like himself , and slowly he began to discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty of a companion in whom one could confide , who understood one 's doubts and fears and the very terrors of life itself . It was the first friend he had ever had , and into the friendship he poured .111 the emotion which slowly he had come to withhold more and more from the overpowering Marianna ; for as he had begun to doubt in God he had begun to doubt in her as well . Slowly as he grew used to the separation he began to doubt that she was infallible , that shep190was saintly , even that she was a noble martyr . He lived away from home now . He saw perhaps that other mothers were different . Now that he had tasted freedom , the world began to open up before him . The name of the friend was Chauncey Knox , and presently they took a room together in the house of the professor of theology , a man named Roscoe Bates . It was then that Marianna grew suspicious . Perhaps she felt from the tone of his letters that he was slipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which she lived , the coolness that crept into the words set down with a certain perfunctoriness that turned them mysteriously into formulas . Once more she descended upon the seminary and did her best to destroy the friendship which she suspectedwas weaning her son from her . And for a time she succeeded , but Thomas , the son , had caught a glimpse of other horizons and there must have been in him , even as a boy , something of his father 's quiet craftiness and of his mother 's overwhelming willfulness , for quietly he returned to his friend . He returned in secret . So passed the year , and presently the time for his ordination as a preacher drew near , and Marianna came once more to the seminary and his deception was uncovered . There was a fresh hurricane , more terrible than any which had gone before . There were wild tears and reproaches , and the storm fell alike upon the son and upon his friend . What she said no one will ever know , but three days later Chauncey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past the seminary . Her son Thomas was ordained a preacher , but he never preached a sermon and Marianna lost him forever . He disappeared , and for more than two years there was no news of him , and then one day he returned quietly and went to work reading law in the office of a friend of his father 's . Thomas Willingdonknew that his son had returned , but it was a week before Mariannadiscovered it . She wrote to him and came to see him at the law office , but he would not return , and when she threatened to create another storm he walked out of the room as he had seen his father do so many times . Marianna went home and took to her bed , wher she remained until her twin sister , the tiny , capable , **25;2029;TOOLONG , left her farm and business and fourteen children and routed her out . A year after he returned to the Town young Thomas married a girl called Ellen Winchell , the daughter of a man of English descent who kept a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding , and as the last words of the ceremony were being spoken she fainted ( lead away and had to be carried to the " spare room " and fanned and fed with blackberry cordial . But neither her husband nor her son came near her , and in the end she recovered her senses and ate a hearty dinner . The bride was a handsome girl with dark hair and eyes , modest and possessed of a strong character and a quiet philosophy of resignation , two weapons of which she had great need in the years that were to follow . She had been brought up simply by her father , the chemist , who was a quiet fellow given to experiments with a bent toward science rather than shopkeeping . I think she must have been deeply in love with her morose , emotionally unstable young husband , and that it was a love which endured through all the long years of their married life . It survived neglect and long absences and coldness . She had a faithful heart . Her trials began a little more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned her and his law studies and disappeared into the West . From time to time she received a letter from him , but she was never able to write him , because he never sent any address . Sometimes the letters came from California , sometimes from New Mexico , sometimes from Nevada , and in none of them was there any hint of his returning home . She returned to live with her father in the big brick house of which the drug store occupied the ground floor , and the burden of her support fell upon her father and old Thomas Willingdon . Eight months after her husband disappeared a son was born . He was five years old when his father returned suddenly and learned of his existence . He had a way of disappearing and returning thus . It happened a half dozen times during Ellen 's life . She would find a note andp192discover that he had gone away , and then , after three or for years had passed , the bell at the door of the drug store would ring one evening and Ellen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fine in need of medicines , and there she would find her husband . Heywould come in and eat supper and return to her bed without comment on his absence , as if he had never been away at all . There was no . questionof divorce and I ( 10 not think she would have divorced him even , if she had lived in a day when divorce was a conventional affair . She never questioned him about his long absences and he rarely spoke of them , so that she never really knew where he had been or what he had been doing . It appeared to have troubled Ellen 's father no more than herself . Ile was a vague old gentleman and scarcely noticed whether his son-in-law was in the house or not . On his first return he remained nearly a year , and then one evening , on the eve of the Civil War , there was a note left on the dining-room table and he was gone again . This time he went to Montana , where he fought Indians and prospected for copper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high mountains . He had a mule and a pick and a shovel and a big pack filled mostly with books . He never discovered any rich mines , although vaguely he staked out a few claims of which he afterward lost the papers . But I do not think that it was gold or copper that he really sought . No man , to the misfortune of his family , ever held wealth in less esteem . Gold and copper were simply excuses for solitude , without which he could not have lived . It was during the second absence that Johnny 's father was born . The Civil War was over and Johnny 's father was four years old when the wanderer returned again , took off his hat , and sat down to supper to find that he had two sons instead of one . His sons knew him scarcely at all , for out of their whole youth , he spent altogether not more than two or three years in the house with them , and even when he was at home he remained remote and showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him in his youth and manhood which his wife alone knew and understood , some sympathy , some occasional burst of warmth ,  |p193which  was revealed to her alone . She stood by him , and when het father died she kept on the drug store as a means of supporting her two children . The business gradually failed , and when Johnny 's father was fourteen she sold what remained of it . And when that money was gone , Johnny 's father at eighteen went to work in a bank . Old Thomas Willingdon helped them , but the elder son was no aid . At nineteen he too had gone off to see the world . Ellen , who was Johnny 's grandmother Willingdon , died before he was born . One day when she had pains she refused to send for the doctor and took some strong physic . She had appendicitis and the physic killed her when she was still a strong woman of sixty . Her pictures are those of a woman with a fine , good-humored face who never made any attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were married , they went to live with her because there was not enough money for two households , and mother-in-law and daughter-in-law dwelt together in peace and deep affection until Ellen died . And Johnny 's mother was no weak , small woman without a character of her own . But she adored her mother-in-law . All his life The Old Man was unhappy save perhaps for those times when he escaped into utter solitude . He was , I think , incapable of giving or receiving warmth . Something at some time had hurt him , so profoundly that from then onward until he died he was afraid of being hurt and so withdrew more and more into himself . He possessed a profoundly emotional nature and the character to control it , and always he was driven , I suspect , by a horror of unbridled emotionalism . The scenes and quarrels and swoonings of Marianna left a mark on all her children , and the memory of them left her son frozen forever , incapable of showing any feeling . Her two daughters died as old maids in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of her son Thomas was more complex than that of her daughters . Somewhere , deep beneath the icy surface , there flowed the currents of her own hot blood and of old Thomas Willingdon 's , old sensuality . But for them there was no outlet and their flames burnt themselves out at last in the furnaces of a fierce interior life.  |p194In  the end , I think he found that the only means of enduring life lay in utter detachment from it . He had not the blessings of a man of action , never having known that curious animal vitality which drove old Jamie to create and achieve , to breed and to mingle with his fellow men , leaving him no time in the day 's short span for morbid introspection . Whatever joys and sorrows he knew , occurred not in the market places , but in the fastnesses of his own soul , concealed there so proudly and so profoundlythat none could ever divine when he was happy or sorrowful . And so he became as detached physically and spiritually from the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . Johnny 's mother , who was for all the world like her father , old Jamie , had a contempt for him which he in his turn reciprocated . For years they lived in the same house , hating each other with an inevitability which was Greek and classic . To her his worst vice was what she called his laziness . Herself all that was positive and active , she could not fathom the paralysis of a tormented divided soul ; nor could she ever forgive him his detachment or the profound mystery which prevented him from ever doing a constructive action in all his existence . She did not understand that laziness was not his vice , but a paralyzing cynicism , nor that his aloofness was not a thing of his own choice , but imposed upon him tragically against his will . His soul , I think , existed in a perpetual state of interrogation  --  a ceaseless questioning of the value or the reason for everything about him . It was a soul which was profoundly sick , and his hysterical wanderings were born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as from his fellow creatures . He lived to be eighty-three years old , and save for a few illumined , mysterious moments , life was forever intolerableto him . He had in all his life , so far as Johnny ever knew , only one close friend . This was a man of his own age , the most distinguished man in all the Town and County , perhaps even in all the State . He wa a General Vandervelde , a man of Dutch ancestry who had sery both in the Mexican War and in the War of Secession . He was tall man , very straight and military in appearance , yet by nature tp195much of a gentleman to have acquired the brutal manners and gaucheries of the usual professional soldier . His blue eyes were merry and his beard the whitest Johnny ever saw on an old gentleman . His complexion was very fair and pink . In Johnny 's memory he remainsas the cleanest , merriest old man he ever saw . Like the Colonel , he belonged more to the eighteenth century than to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good things of life , his poise and detachment , his humor and charm , his tolerance and the extraordinary distinction of appearance , were all in direct antagonism to the sour respectability and bad taste which colored so much of the community and the century in which he lived . He brought to the Town and the County a distinction which was rare in that time and place . Throughout the years that The Old Man lived with Johnny 's family the old General came three times a week to climb the dark stairs of the " back way " to the room above the kitchen . He walked with a stick , very straight , his white beard blowing over his spotless shirt front . His carriage was very different from that of The Old Man . He moved with the dignity and assurance of a man who had ( lone his duty and earned the respect of his neighbors and his nation , a man who knew exactly what he believed and in his rationalism felt the earth solid and fine beneath his feet . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , morose , sentimental , Gothic temperament of The Old Man , his friend . It was a strange friendship which must have had its roots in the liking of the two men for books and for interminable philosophic discussions . In the room above the kitchen the two would remain closeted , talking and smoking and eating apples for hours on end . The General also lived to an immense age and died a few weeks after The Old Man . I should like to believe in heaven if only to know that they are now sitting somewhere together smoking and talking philosophy . I think the General understood the lonely Old Man who lived surrounded by books , in exile from all the Town and even from his own family . In the end , as he grew older , Johnny came to understand him ap196little , for there were moments , unwanted and even terrifying , when he felt creeping over him a strange weariness of the world , a hunger for solitude , and a desire to hide away like a hermit in the desert . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and questioning and hated cynicism and bitterness , and a sense of disappointment and disillusionment with all the world about him . It was like a horrible disease which Johnny carne to light whenever he felt it stealing over him , for he had memories both of The Old Man and his grandfatherJamie and he knew that the man who had lived by action was the happy one of the two . In his old age , The Old Man had been bitter and tragic , yet one felt that there were things he knew which none of the others had ever imagined . llcltind the burning eyes and that air of immense age one suspected that it was better never to penetrate . It was perhapsthat quality which made his presence in any group of people disturbing and gave you the feeling , when the brilliant eyes looked at you , that he saw through all the defenses and hypocrisies and knew you at once completely , with all your sins and vices , petty dishonesties and evil thoughts . There was something intolerable in the gaze of The Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born understanding too much , and out of his own bitter sufferingsI think he came in the end to know things of men and women which they themselves dared not to face . A little while after The Old Man came to live in the slate-gray house , Greataunt Sapphira , his mother 's twin sister , had her hun- , dredth birthday and all the descendants were invited to the first reunion of the descendants of Jorge and Elvira to be held since the days when Elvira , as an old lady , gathered her sons and daughters and grandchildren about her in the big house at van Essen 's mills . She had been dead now more than half a century and her daughter Sapphira was the oldest living member of the family . At the age of a hundred , this old lady herself addressed letters of invitation to the heads of each of the now countless branches of the family . And so a Letter in Sapphira 's tremulous , scratchy handwriting came to Thep197Old Man , who was past eighty , asking him and his sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Oswego County on the old lady 's birthday in June . But Thomas Willingdon had finished with traveling . I lis wanderingswere at an end and he had come home to die , and not hing could stir him from the security and solitude of that room above the kitchen . In his son 's family one of the periodical financial crises was in progress , and it was therefore impossible that all of them should make the long journey into the southern part of the State . So after a conference it was decided that Johnny and his father should be sent , one to represent the fourth and the other the fifth generation to have been born since Jorge and Elvira came into the new country . It was Johnny 's first long train journey , and the excitement was so great that during all the hot journey he was sick . They arrived in Williamsburg to find that in the small town every hotel and boarding-house was already filled with the descendants of Jorge and Elvira , and in the end they threw themselves upon the hospitality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overflowing and at length they were given a room in the stables which was usually occupied by one of the farmhands . It was a small room built of fresh unpainted pine and it smelled of horses and harness and soap , and when one wakened in the morning one looked out over a paddock filled with colts and yearlings . For a small boy it was a room finer than any palace . For Johnny 's father , with his passion for horses , it was paradise . Together , father and son , fed the colts sugar and examined the brood mares and rubbed the sleek withers of the two big stallions , Jereboam and Achilles . There were horses everywhere . One saw them , one felt them , one smelled them  --  big fine Morgan stallions and mares and colts . The old lady still lived on the farm to which she had come as a bride more than eighty years before . To arrive at the farmhouse one turned in off the highroad from Williamsburg through an archway on which was painted in golden letters Spring Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of maple trees between pastures where mares and foals of all sizes looked up and galloped wildlyp198round as one drove past . At Spring Hill Farm they had bred Morgan hors , s since the stock came into existence . There were always a score or more colts of various ages , two stallions , and a dozen brood mares . The horses which drew the carriage of the old lady on the rare occasions when she left t he farm were always the pick of the stable . The house , like that built by the Colonel , was large and rambling and white , and stood on a slight rise in the land . At the foot of the slope the big cool spring welled up to water the pastures and give the place its name . In the beginning its waters had been forced up the hill into the house by an old-fashioned ram , but the old lady , believing in progress , was always interested in the latest inventions and had long since had installed a gasoline engine to take the place of the ram . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far too prosperous and modern . The fences were all of wood , and big barns and stables were painted a cheery banal red . At each corner of the cowbarn stood the first silos in all the State . Sapphira was a rich old lady . From the days when she had run beside the wagon train along the trail from Maryland , collecting bluejayfeathers and bright stones in a cloth bag , she had gone on acquiringpossessions . In her youth and in her prime it was her shrewdness and energy operating through a bewhiskered Victorian husband which had built up the stock farm and guided all manner of shrewd speculations and wise investments . And when he died of pneumonia , caught at sixty-seven from driving all night in a sleet storm , she carried on . After his death it became apparent that he had never really counted at all save as the begetter of Sapphira 's fourteen children . Sapphira , everyone saw , had always been the real source of brains and shrewdness , for she not only kept the fortune which she had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to add to it . For nearly forty years she had been a widow and for nearly forty years she had continued to grow richer and richer . On the day . of the reunion there were four enormous long tables placed on the lawn beneath the trees and all of them were filled with the descendants of Jorge and Elvira van Essen . In all there were more than fifteen hundred , but a few hundreds of them had been unablep199to attend . Some lived in California , and some in Washington and Oregon , and some in Europe , and one greatgrandson with a family of five was consul in Singapore . There were Patersons and Butterworths , Wallingdons and van Essens , Joneses and MacDonalds , mostly modest , sober citizens ranging from one who was a blacksmith to the old lady 's eldest son , Eben , who had been a Congressman , and her grandson who was a State Senator . Of her own descendants there were one hundred and eighty-six and some of them had not been able to come . Jorge and Elvira , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . In that new country they had left enough descendants to populate a town . For the feast there were three barbecued oxen and five lambs , as well as countless chickens , roasted with sweet corn and potatoes in the ashes of a fire which consumed several whole trees . There were cider and beer and cold water from the spring-house , and scores of pies . Sapphira 's daughters and granddaughters and **25;2056;TOOLONG their relatives . There was even . a great-great-grandchildof eleven who had a place beside that kept for old Sapphira at the head of the most important table . Under the trees and about the fires gathered uncles and aunts , cousins and nephews and nieces , children and grandchildren and greatgrandchildren who had never encountered one another before . There were some who until that moment had not known of the existence of the others . They gossiped and chatted and exchanged stories and planned visits which in the end were never made . Only one person present knew who they all were or that they existed at all . He was Eben , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself eighty-two years old . The family was his hobby and he had a great ledger in which he had all the descendants filed and ticketed neatly . At last , when everything was ready and the oxen and sheep roasted to a turn , old Sapphira , accompanied by her son Eben , came out of the house . She was a tiny old woman , who looked scarcely bigger than a bird . She was dressed in purple ( for she detested black ) and wore a bonnetp200covered with sequins and ornamented with ostrich tips . As she came out of the door and moved across the lawn , the news of her arrival was whispered from group to group under the trees and a silence fell like the shadow of a cloud over the whole big lawn , as one by one and in little groups the descendants of Jorge and Elvira van Essen turned toward her . As Johnny turned he was overcome suddenly by awe , almost by terror , at the " sight of anyone so old , and slipped his hand into that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old lady 's very spry for a hundred , " and another cousin murmured , " But for her a hundred and eighty-two of us would n't be here . " Some one laughed nervously , and then out of the silence some one cheered in a far corner of the yard and the cheer spread from group to group . The 0l*1 lady , as if surprised , turned and stood leaning on her stick , looking about her . Then slowly she understood and her ancient face softened . She smiled and , raising her stick with the friendliness of one sure of her importance and accustomed to authority , she shook it in a gesture of greeting to all the descendants of Jorge and Elvira . Some one started " Auld Lang Syne , " and when the singing was finished everyone moved toward the tables . But there were even more descendants than the Honorable Eben had counted upon ; and some of the lesser ones had to eat their dinners sitting on the grass beneath the trees , because there was no place for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Sapphira took her leave and retired to the parlor to receive certain chosen members of the family . She asked for her nephew , Thomas Willingdon , and when she was told that The Old Man had not come , she sent for Johnny and his father and together they went in to speak to her . She sat in a big armchair , rather like an elderly bird in a nest , smoking a pipe now because her son Eben no longer allowed her to smoke cigars . Lately she had become absent-minded and some- ' times left them , lighted , here and there about the house . There was something hard about the old lady which frightened Johnny , and he held back shyly . As they crossed the room her sopp201Eben , who sat beside her , shouted , " Here 's Thomas 's son and grandson , " and a look of understanding came into the ( lark old eyes . For a moment she regarded the pair standing before her , up and down , as if they were children , and then said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Johnny 's father explained that The 01 ( 1 Mon was too ill to come to Spring Hill Farm . It was a lie and the old lady knew it . She said , " Well , I never expected him to come , anyway . He never put himself out for anybody . He always was queer . " Then she took Johnny 's hand and said , " You 've never seen anybody so old , have you , lad ? " But when Johnny tried to speak , he could find no words , and the old lady said , impatiently , " What 's the matter ? Cat got your tongue ? " " No . " " Well , it 's all right , " and turning toward Johnny 's father , she asked , " Do you remember my father , Jorge ? " James Willingdon said that Old Jorge had died long before he was born . " Aye , that 's true , " said the old lady . " I forgot you were one of the youngsters . " Then , dismissing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas he should have come . Yes , I 've got it right now , You 're ' the grandson of my sister Marianna . Marianna always was a fool ! " It was the first and last time Johnny ever saw Sapphira who had run beside the wagon train coming over the mountains from Maryland . She had borne fourteen children , all of whom were healthy and lived to great ages . She played the piano and sang and smoked cigars . She had built up a fat fortune and refused ever to leave the farm to which she had come as a girl . In all her life she never weighed more than ninety-eight pounds . She lived for four more years , and to the end she treated her son Eben , who was eighty-six when she died , as if he had never grown up . Besides The Old Man there were two other grandchildren of Jorge and l lvira in the Town who did not go to ' the reunion at Sapphira 's Both of them were old maids . Indeed , they were more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ago they had reached thep202age when neither virginity nor sex had anything to do with them . To Johnny it seemed that they had been there forever . He was aware always that in some way they were related to him , but no one in the family ever thought of addressing them as Cousin Zenobia or Cousin Susan . Perhaps it was because they were , both of them , caricatures of women , and so were unconsciously regarded by the family as creationsof a God with a talent somewhat like that of Dickens . They were always spoken of as Zenobia van Essen and Susan Wilkes , as if the family had washed its hands of them . Zenobia van Essen lived in a house outside the Town which stood in the shadow of the hard gray walls of the State Prison  --  a house which was very much like the Castle of Mr. Wemmick in Great Expectations . It was a miniature house with countless tiny gables and turrets and castellations , with doors which seemed scarcely large enough to pass through . Surrounding it was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of flowers gone wild . Honeysuckle , wistaria , and eglantine climbed over the whole cottage , devouring the jig-saw bracketing . In the corner of the garden there was a miniature ravine shaded by huge willow trees , and at the bottom of it there was a deep cold spring . An ornamental wooden fence , also in the process of being devoured by honeysuckle and trumpet vine , surrounded the place , and at a little distance from the house there was a gazebo in which Zenobia sometimes sat in hot weather . Chickens and turkeys and ducks wandered about the doorstep , and exotic ducks and geese with strange-colored feathers and tufted heads swam on the miniature pond below the spring . Whole families of cats slept in the sun by the doorstep . Instead of the cannon and the moat which Mr. Wemmick used as defenses against invasion , Zenobia van Essen had an old white horse , which was far more effective . He had never known saddle or harness and had passed his whole life comfortably guarding Zenobia 's property as a watch-dog . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears hack and teeth bared , to attack . At a word from Zenobia his whole aspect would change and he would turn into an amiable old dobbin and wander off to nibble the grass and the flowers . But Zenobia seldom gave the word of restraint , P203for as she grew more and more ancient she also became more and more solitary . The old horse was called Robin . The garden of Zenobia van Essen was an island in the thousand acres and more of the land used by the prison for a farm which was worked by the prisoners . Long before Johnny was born the State had condemned Zenobia 's little piece of land and ordered her to move out of her cottage , but the State did not know Zenobia . She stood on her rights as a citizen and an individual and for months she refused to leave the place for fear that she would return to find it in the process of being pulled down . She began a series of lawsuits which dragged on for years , and in the end the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to remain in the midst of the prison farm , with only convicts for neighbors . She had a reputation for being the stubbornest woman in the County and there was nothing which she enjoyed so much as complicated interminable battles in the courts . When Johnny first saw her she was already an old woman well past seventy , tall , vigorous , straight , and dressed in the fashion of the early ' eighties . She had brilliant black eyes and her hair was still black , although whether she dyed it or not Johnny never knew . She was a distant cousin of Johnny 's father 's because she was the child of Jacob van Essen , the son of Jorge and Elvira , who had married the granddaughter of a Wyandot Chief . In Zenobia the Indian blood returned in full flower . She had a bronze skin and high cheek bones and always walked like an Indian , as if she wore moccasins instead of shoes . None of the family ever did very much about their relationship to Zenobia because she was an extremely uncomfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hat and the less one was noticed by her the better . She always wore a purple dress with a hustle and a skirt so long that it appeared to be a train , a large plumed hat with a veil which she wore thrown hack from her face , and lace mitts . So long as Johnny knew her , she never had any other costume . In it she walked the two miles from her cottage to the Town , never troubling to lift the train , but allowing its ruffles to swish behind her in the dust , an eccentricity which always gave herp204the air of a tragedy queen . As she walked along the road on a hot summer morning her ruffles raised as much dust as a flock of sheep . There was something in her carriage , the proud turn of her head , and her old-fashioned clothes which was very like the Carolus Duran portrait of Sarah Bernhardt . Over her eccentric figure and the fantastic little cottage hung an aura of genuine melodrama . Zenobia , as a young girl , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . Also she was handsome . And when her father died and her younger brothers and sisters went to live with uncles and aunts , Zenobia refused to leave the lonely cottage and sometimes , to the scandal of the community , received there unprotected the suitors who came to woo her for her looks and her fortune . Not all of them were welcome , and sometimes she had trouble in ridding herself of the undesirable ones . One of these , a young man called Zachariah Betts , showed an unusual ardor . He would not be dismissed , and when she would no longer open the door to him he came at night to wander about the garden , calling out his admiration and attempting now and then to force the shutters . If he had had greater powers of penetrating the character of Zenobia , he would have abandoned her and sought some other heiress , for Zenobia , even as a girl , had no great gift of patience , and after a time the visits of the ardent Mr. Betts began to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she heard him trying the shutters and calling out to her amorously from the garden , and , her patience at an end , she shouted that if he did not go away she would fire her pistol through the window . Still Mr. Betts lingered , begging her to let him in , until at last the exasperated Zenobia took aim and fired through the shutters from which the sound of her suitor 's pleadings had come . She was troubled no more that night , and in the morning she discovered the reason . Outside in the flower-bed under the window she found Mr. Betts lying dead . There was a trial and Zenobia would have no lawyer . She defended herself and was acquitted , but afterward she refused all suitors , and after Mr. Betts 's experience none of them attempted to force their attentions upon her . The trial seemed to have given her a liking forp205he courts , and after that she took up the study of law and installed .1 whole library of law books in the cottage . In all her suits later in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end she came to know he law better than a good many of the lawyers in the Town . In a way her tragedy was that of a woman born at the wrong time . She had intelligence and independence and great force of character , but in her day and situation there was nothing left for her to do but become an eccentric and to end her life as the prey of small boys who came to the cottage to torment her and the old white horse . Of about the same age was Susan Wilkes , who was the , daughter of another of Jorge and Elvira 's children . She was a leading Congregationalistand all her life was troubled by transcendental yearnings and plans for the reform , but more especially , I think , for the refinementof mankind . In appearance she was not the typical reformer of her day . There was nothing of Carrie Nation about her . On the contrary , she had an air of meekness and Christian humility which was utterly deceptive . Behind it lurked a will of Bessemer steel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bulldog . She was a leading member of the Anti-Saloon League , the Women 's Christian Temperance Union , the Anti-Tobacco League , and half a dozen other organizations . She was of the breed of Frances Willard and Mary Baker Eddy . She had a horror of untidiness and of germs , and it troubled her , I think , that her fellowmen should be gross and untidy . Her horror of drink was founded less upon moral grounds than upon the fact that occasionally a citizen returning from a spree was sick on the sidewalk before her house , and she condemned tobacco less because of its depraving influence than because of the cigar butts which vulgar men left about . On a big elm tree before her door she had a carefully painted sign put up which read , " Please do not spit or leave cigar hints on my sidewalk , " with the result that many citizens who had no desire to spit at all managed to do so as they passed her house , and others cherished cigar butts all day long in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the evening . In her horror of germs she used to go twice a year into all the schoolrooms ( a favorP206granted her because she was rich and was also somewhat feared even by tough politicians ) in order to lecture the children upon the peril of communicating germs to their interiors by touching their faces with their hands . She was a strange figure with a long thin neck which curved upwardand outward , and she had a little the look of a secretary-bird . Johnny knew her for years and he never observed the slightest change in her costufne . Always she wore a long skirt of black material as durable as iron , a shirtwaist , and a shawl thrown round her shoulders . She never wore a hat and when it rained or snowed she drew the shawl over her head . Her skirts were made exactly the same , back , sides and front , with an elastic at the top , so that as the portions on which she sat wore out she could turn them around . It may have been that : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or that she was born in a skirt  --  a phenomenon which , considering her refinement and modesty , was not impossible . She was given to rather flowery language , and on the sign which she placed over the gate to her orchard was not the familiar " No Trespassing , " but , " These are not public ways . " She had a brother much younger than herself whom she guarded as closely as her own canaries , but somehow at some moment when she was not watching him he must have put his hand to his face , for a germ entered his body and he was stricken with a long illness from which he died . He was a deacon of the church and on the day of his death members of the congregation telephoned Susan for news of him . She herself answered all the telephone calls . All hope had been abandoned , but instead of saying simply that her brother was dying , she replied , " Mr. Wilkes is just passing through the gates . " Johnny entered her house but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy by his mother , and out of the visit he carried only the memory of a huge bust of Napoleon , more than twice life-size , which dominated a long drawing-room stuffed to capacity with furniture . Why Miss Susan Wilkes had chosen Napoleon for her hero Johnny never understood . She was very penurious and it may have been that she inherited the bust and kept it because she could not bear top209waste or throw away anything . She saved the cards left by the people who called upon her , and when she ret tinned their calls she brought the cards with her so that they might use them again . She lived to be nearly a hundred , and when she died she disappointedher relatives by dividing her fortune among the AntiSaloonLeague , the Anti-Tobacco League , , and a home for dogs and cats which was to be called by the terms of her will , The Susan Wilkes Cat and Dog Hostel and Asylum . How she was able to reconcile her hatred for germs with her solicitude for cats Johnny was never able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture and in the name she chose for the animal home , It was as if she appreciated her own flavor and was determined that it should go on after she died .   ONE of Johnny 's earliest memories was like those of " The Dauphin , " of mobs and torches . It was it cold clear November night and he had been in his bed for hours when slowly he wakened out of a confused dream to hear the barking of dohs and the shouts of men and the sound of a brass band . Outside in the street there was a fire and scores of torches and flares whose light filled the bedroom . He was eight or nine years old and too big a boy to cry , so he pulled the bedclothes over his head and lay there , hiding and comforting his younger brother , until the door opened and his mother came in . She told Johnny to put on his flannel dressing-gown , and wrapping his brother in a blanket she took them in to another room to lock out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was filled with men and dogs . In the street they had built a great fire . A band , the players recruited here and there , played " Hail to the Chief " discordantly . Men shouted and dogs barked and fought . It was a terrifying spectacle in spite of its friendliness . They had come only to congratulate James Willingdonon his election as County Treasurer . It was one of the rare elections when the Democrats had won , and they wanted him to buy them a barrel of beer so that they might continue the celebration . In all the Town and the County and the State , there was nothing of such palpitating interest as politics . Kings might be assassinated , wars occur , ships sink at sea , and whole cities like San Francisco fall into ruin overnight , but none of these things really touched that rich Middle Western country very profoundly . One talked of them for a day or two and then forgot them . Europe and China and South America were equally remote . It was politics , always politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eve of an election ,  |p209families  were divided by strife , brothers ceased to speak to each other . In the school yard enemies became friends for a few weeks because they came from Democratic families , and friends became enemies be , cause their fathers belonged to opposing parties . Every small boy bedeckedhis coat with rows of celluloid buttons bearing the images of his party 's candidates from the President to the County Sheriff . There were fist fights and black eyes , and on election night the children were allowed to stay up till midnight to hear the first returns . In that Middle Western County one breathed politics . From childhood one knew about party bosses and the sanctity of one 's own party and the corruptness of the other ; for there were only two parties . On the wrong side of the railroad tracks a little cluster of German Socialists held a meeting now and then , and in the Flats and the Syndicate there were perhaps half a dozen Anarchists and Syndicalists , but none of these counted . Their candidates did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few of them were citizens . They did not matter . One was a Democrat or a Republican . In Johnny 's childhood the parties were evenly divided in local elections and one never knew for certain which side would win . It was inevitable that such an atmosphere should produce weak Presidents like McKinley and Harding , dictatorslike Hanna , and cheap bosses like Cox and Harry Daugherty . It was inevitable that the politics of that County should always have a tremendous influence for evil as well as for good , in Washington and at any national convention . Every schoolboy was an apprentice at politics . By the time he was old enough to vote he knew all the tricks . Although Johnny 's father was elected to office two or three times and all his life remained a small political figure with a devoted following , he was a failure in politics . He was a handsome new , gentle and simple , with a charm and an honesty which led many men to support whatever he undertook , but he had one great failing . Ie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary in a political life that was highly organized and all too frequently dominated by unscrupulous bosses or business men seeking privilegesin return for money . The reproach was never made againstp210him that he was dishonest or even sharp , accusations brought often enough during the heat of a political fight against every candidate . The politicians had small use for him because he was too honest . Sometimes they said , as if it were a reproach , that he did not know how to make money , and in the eyes of certain citizens that was the worst fault of all . He would have liked a gift of a million or two dollars from the blue , but he had no talent for making it . The fundamental fault was that he was simple in all his tastes and had no very great passion for money . If he had had the million or two , he would scarcely have lived differently , save perhaps that he would have had a stableful of trotting-horses . All his life Johnny heard Americans say that they could not imagine a life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a statement which , upon examination later in life , seemed to reveal a singular poverty of spirit and imagination in a world so filled with possibilities of diversion , enjoyment , and even service . His father was one of those who , without the necessity for work , could have made for himself a full , rich life . The gift was born not of the complexity of his nature , but rather of its simplicity , for his tastes were for the fundamentalthings of existence  --  for land , for animals , for his children , and for the endless enjoyment of friendly contact with his fellowmen . He was a philosopher and had a deep romantic love of nature which , except for a few rare moments in his existence , was tragically unsatisfied . These things all made him a friend to the farmer , and although he failed on the one occasion when he turned to the land , his friends and his political following was always among the men who cultivated the soil . His earliest memory was of sitting among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen women of the Town , come in to seek the advice of his calm and sensible mother , discussed the chances of Morgan 's Raiders , who were burning their way north , descending upon them . Nearly all of the men were at the war and the women talked wildly of organizing the old men and the boys into a militia of defense . The Old Man , then a young man , was P211somewhere in Idaho , prospecting and helping to fight Indians . But the Raiders never reached the Town , because the wild and gallant Morgan was defeated and captured in the battle of Buffington 's Island . From the time he was a child until he was forty James Willingdon was forced by necessity to undertake work which he did not like . As a boy he worked in the failing chemist 's shop which had belonged to his grandfather , and when that was sold he went to work in a bank , and although he rose to be cashier and director , he never had any talent or liking for either shopkeeping or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he escaped and never returned . Although he had none of the Colonel 's blood in his veins , he was in his tastes and character very like the old philosopher . In life , however , they had fared differently , for the Colonel had been born well-off with every opportunity for satisfying his tastes and desires , and Johnny 's father had been born poor , with the necessity of work . ing to provide for others , for his mother and father and even at times for his own brother , for his own wife and children , and for relatives who were forever coming to him for aid . It was a necessity from which he did not escape until he was old and his own children grown and gone away . Because he was always too friendly and too generous he was forever lending money which was never returned to him . He was a gentle man with fair hair and very bright blue eyes . In him the almost pure Willingdon English blood , come down through New England , asserted itself . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the broad fleshiness which some , how seemed to claim most of those descended from the first settlers About the corners of his eyes there were crow's-feet which came of good humor , but as he grew older little lines came about the corners of his mouth and a shadow of bitterness into his laugh . They came , I think , from the long , slow process of disillusionment . He had begun by liking and trusting all his fellow men , but at the end , I think , he only trusted those who were simple and without worldly ambition . Like a good many fathers and sons , James Willingdon and his  |p212son  Johnny were shy with each other , although the shyness disappeared as Johnny grew older and wiser and came to understand that much of it arose out of the long contact of a sensitive personality with insensitive and sometimes brutal people . Ile was shy because he was afraid of being hurt and unwilling to expose himself to abuse and ridicule . There was a great deal of poetry in his nature and in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ella Wheeler Wilcox , James Whitcomb Riley and Edgar Guest . Living with him day after clay , one had the feeling that circumstance and a hard life had suppressed something fundamental in his nature . It was only when one saw him in the country talking endlessly with the farmers or in those moments when he would escape from the Town to wander over the fields , that one felt he was himself , fullgrown , unhampered , and happy . He was content to run for hours across snow-covered fields , followinghis dogs in pursuit of some rabbit which they never caught , or to sit all day in the shadow of a willow , catching suckers and sunfish and silversides . The blood of his ancestors from the English country-. side was strong in him . He should have been born in England , for in England there was a place for him . In that Middle Western County in his youth there was really none . Yet he was a man without resentment . The scornful , acid bitternessof his father , " The Old Man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never touched him . I do not think that it ever occurred to him that there was anything at fault in the materialistic world about him . If he did not fit , he assumed that the fault was his , believing that he should have adjusted himself somehow to a society for which he was unsuited . Because Johnny shared his liking for nature , it was on their expeditionsinto the country that the shyness between father and son was dissipated . It was not that they talked much . Sometimes they must have ridden side by side in a buggy or sat fishing together for hours with scarcely a word spoken between them . It was unnecessary to speak , for if a swallow skimmed low or a kingfisher darted over the water in a flash of gold and blue , they both saw it and they knewP213that they felt the same about it . If the wild iris were especially vivid or the willows a superb green , it was not necessary for one to tell the other . I Ls delight at catching a half-pound sunfish was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tarpon-fishing of Florida or the salmon-fishing of Nova Scotia , but I doubt that they would have given him more excitement than the fishing below the darn at van Essen 's mill . Sometimes Johnny and his father went alone on , these expeditions , but he liked best the great family excursions which took place on holidays and sometimes on Sundays . On those occasions the whole family rose at dawn , taking a vast lunch prepared the day before , and set out in a surrey with two horses and never less than two dogs . Sometimes the goal was a spot along the Black Fork where the fishing slowly became ruined by the contamination of factories ; and sometimes the family went to Onara or to Belleville , villages where there were fishing streams . But the favorite spot was van Essen 's mill where Jorge and Elvira had settled long ago . It no longer belonged to the fmily , for it was sold in Thomas Willingdon 's old age , and The Old Man 's share of the money had long since been spent during his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood , reflected in the waters of the mill dam . They were built of sandstone from a quarry in the hill beyond the flat land of the valley , and with the passing of a hundred years the red stone had lost its first rich brightness and was tawny and stained with moss and lichen where it was not hidden by ivy and Virginia creeper . Along the edge of the stream beneath the willowsgrew great clumps of blue and yellow wild iris and wax-leaved buttercups . The land all about was low-lying and damp and in the fields near by the corn grew twice as high as a tall man . Its ribbons of leaves were the deep rich green of corn which grows under a hot sun in rich , black , deep soil . The sight of it so rich and flourishinggave one a deep feeling of pleasure . Below the darn among the water-lilies , the fishing was excellent . Part of the big house was closed , and the farmer who lived there chose the rooms which gave on the river . He was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottomland had to work hard to stave off mortgages . He and his wife were friendly to Johnny 's family because the house had been built by Jorge and Elvira . The mill was nearly always silent . Its vast granaries were empty and here and there among the cobwebs there were still traces of flour milled years before . By the time Johnny was born , farmers no longer came there to have their flour ground from their own wheat . They sold the wheat and bought the flour in the Town , and the vast difference in the price which they received for their wheat and paid for their flour lay the roots of one aspect of their constantly increasingtroubles . The old-fashioned machinery was kept oiled because it had a certain value and because the farmer who owned it stubbornly cherished a hope that some day the big millstones would once more grind out flour for half the County . The expeditions in other directions each had their particular charm , especially the one to Onara , where one drove through the village into a countryside of wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roadside and follow all day the banks of a meanderingstream , fishing hole after hole under the willows . It was a landscapesoft and green like toe loveliest English countryside . At that time there was no such thing as private fishing . In all the County there was only one stream owned by a club of which Uncle Harry was a member . Men went there to eat and drink well , and fish from a clear green river filled with sinuous weeds . The stream sprang , full born , cold and clear as crystal , from out of the ground where it had traveled hidden away for two hundred miles or more through limestone caverns . The streams , like the nut trees , belonged to everyone and a fisherman could wander where he would , unmolestedby farmers crying , " Trespasser ! " Only a few miles from the Town one found lonely and remote country hidden away along lanes bordered by witchhazel and elderbushes and wild iris where streams of water ran singing secretly beneath the arched willows . In the end the automobile destroyed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the aroma of wilderness . With horses it took two hours to travel the ten miles . TwoP151hours in a motor now only brings one through half a dozen towns and villages , all situated in time ( which , alter all , has become distance ) side by side . There is no longer any wilderness between . Van 1 ? ssen 's mill is only half an hour from the ' Gown and the pretty village of Onara a mere twenty minutes . In a few years the whole County shrunk to a third of its old size . Mystery and adventure , even for children , disappeared . And the automobiles , filled with maraudingparties who tear blossoms from trees and steal fruit from the orchards , have put an end to the old freedom to roam . Where once you could wander where you pleased there are now " No trespassing " signs everywhere , and farmers on the watch for thieves and vandals . In those days , so near and yet so remote , the villages had a special charm of their own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly disappeared . A hundred years earlier they had been settlements begun here and there in fertile spots along an Indian trail by the side of a little stream , and within half a century their whole destinies had been changed by railroads . Ilere and there a village had luck and remained a small market town and shipping center , but most of them were passed by , left to loneliness and decay as the new generation deserted them for towns which had the fortune to be blessed by a railroad . By the time Johnny was old enough to visit them , the forgotten ones were half-deserted and the old New England clapboard houses stood with windows broken , doors ajar , and shutters hanging from their hinges . The orchards had been abandoned to goldenrod and the lilacs had grown into jungles , and here and there against the rotting picket fences lingered the remnants of an old flower-garden  --  a few hollyhocks standing like sentinels , a clump of purple campanulas , and a little patch of bleeding-heart slowly being choked to death by fennel . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , and they sat in the doorways or in the sun and pottered about the old gardens . One had the impression of a world in which everyone was old . In the square or at the crossroads there was always a watering-trough made from a hollow log and overgrown with damp moss beneath a clump of willows . P216Always it was cold , clear spring water which ran from the rotting wooden pipes , and there on a hot summer day one got down from the buggy to drink with the horses . When the old people died the houses in which they had lived all their lives died with them , for they had no value . There was no one to buy them or rent diem , and in some of the villages only two or three old men and women lingered on , surrounded by empty , decaying houses , haunted by the ghosts of the past , until they too died and there was no one . At Onara t here was one house more terrible and sinister than any of the others because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house no one had lived in it for fifty years . It stood on a low hill beside the brook , a little apart from the rest of the village , surrounded by old apple trees and heaven trees and a thicket of candleberry , bushes gone wild . A locust tree grew straight through the roof like a sword piercing a heart . It was said to be haunted , and no one , I think , ever had the courage to disprove the story , for there was something strangely terrifying in the atmosphere of the place even in the daylight of a hot summer afternoon . Once it had been owned by a man named Billings , who lived there alone with his daughter , a girl of nineteen . She loved one of the village boys , but her father , an eccentric man , would not allow her to see him . His harshness accomplished nothing , for one day he found that his daughter was having a baby and she confessed to him that her lover was the father . In a fit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , terrified , he did not leave the body for days . At last , after placing it in a box he hid it under a bed and ran to the lonely house of a farmer in the valley three miles away . There he confessed the crime and disappeared , never to be heard of again . From that day on no one ever lived in the house . It had no owner . Even when it was put up for sale for the taxes , no one bought it . I do not know whether the old house is standing , but I know that the rest of the village has been changed . Now it is only twenty minutes from the Town by a wide road of cement and it has been reborn , settled this second time not by frontiersmen , but by men andp217women who work in the shops and offices and mills of a town which , only a hundred years ago , was half a clay removed from it by a journey through a forest over rough trails . Most of the old houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by old Jamie and his friends has disappeared . There are new houses and some of the old ones have been done over , and at the corner where the watering-trough stood beneath the clump of willows there is a filling station and an ice-cream parlor . Johnny 's father would have liked fine horses , but since he rarely had any money he had to satisfy himself with the best he could get . He knew all the famous trotting-horses and would drive any distance to see a race . He had an adoration for two famous trotters called Maud S. and Dan Patch . The horses he could afford to buy or acquire by trading always had something the matter with them . All of them had the makings of racehorses , but each of them had some illness or was hard-mouthed or possessed a devil 's temper . He always hoped miraculously to cure them of their faults and win a great race with one of them , but I do not remember that any of them ever grew any better for all the care he took with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a race . When they were ill he sent them to pasture at the Farm , and if they were hard-mouthed or ill-tempered , lie tried to cure them himself and sometimes he allowed his sons to try it . He was forever buying and selling and trading and his strange assortment of horses were the greatest pleasure of his life . The able-bodied horses his family used as carriage and saddle horses , so that the only horses Johnny knew as a boy were the ones with hard mouths and bad tempers . In the carriage they would balk or run away , and sometimes Johnny 's mother , tried beyond enduranceby her means of transportation , made scenes and demanded a decent animal to drive . At last she won out and horse called Sunny Jim became her special property . He was a docile , intelligent horse and perfectly sound , but he had so strange a build that buyers regarded him with mirth and suspicion . He had the small head and arching neck of an Arab . In the shoulders he was hack , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children used him as a saddle horse , but none of the children really wanted to ride him , for there was no fun in it . By the time Sunny Jim came into the family the children had acquired a strong taste in horses and Jim seemed a boring , pedantic animal of no interest whatever . Much more fun was a hard-mouthed , long-legged Kentucky running-horsewho would go splendidly until he became bored and decided that the nil Anent had come to return to the stable . Then he would stop abruptly , hurling you forward onto his neck , and begin a series of remarkable backings . If you were able to keep your scat , this performance would sometimes continue for five or ten minutes , and then suddenly , as if he were the sweetest-tempered horse in the world , he would canter off with a comic air of perfect amiability . In one of the fields at the Farm , Johnny and his brother constructedhurdles from fence rails and endeavored to teach this strange assortment of horses to jump . Sometimes they succeeded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dislocated shoulder which he was able to dislocate at will for the rest of his life . And on the calf of his right leg he bore forever the scars of a vicious bite given him by a horse who decided he was tired of jumping and simply turned his head and bit his rider . And once the long-legged Kentucky horse , galloping at top speed along a country road through the wood after dark , slipped and did a perfect somersault , with Johnny underneath , bursting the girth and losing the saddle blanket forever . And there was the day when , driving home with his father behind a team which he had been able to buy cheaply for some mysterious reason , the team suddenly revealed the secret by clenching the bits between their teeth and running off . The mad lark continued for two miles , finally ending in the destruction of a hundred feet of wire fence and a buggy smashed to splinters . Johnny 's father landed on his head , unconscious , and Johnny found himself , a boy of ten , careening down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body had disappeared . Not knowing what else to do , he clung on until the team smashed a gate and came to a stop . Because of this passion for horses and because he was in and outP219of politics James Willingdon knew all the drivers and owners and trainers in the State , and with him Johnny came , as a small boy , to know them along with dozens of horse-dealers and livery-stable proprietors . The livery stable has vanished and I can not think of any difference so symbolic of the change of the times as the difference between a livery stable and a garage . The divergence in tempo between the two institutions is perhaps the greatest of all , for about the livery stable there was always an air of leisure and sleepiness . The proprietor and the stable boys always appeared to be dozing in their chairs when there was nothing else to do . Either they slept or gambled at cards and dice . For a small boy the livery stable was a cavern of enchantment , filled with the odors of horses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was always a bitch and a litter of puppies somewhere about , and a fat sleek cat or two to keep away the rats which lurked in the mows among the cobwebs . And there was something about a livery stable which molded the character of the proprietor and the stablemen , giving them a picturesquecharacter and a poetic flow of indelicate language . In a livery stable a small boy could learn about life in a fine , free , Rabelaisian manner . Perhaps there was something mellow in the leisurely life which livery men led . To Johnny it seemed that the livery-stable men never worked , but always sat with chairs tilted back in the shade of the big elm and sycamore trees and in winter about the big iron stove , drinking coffee and gambling with a greasy pack of cards . They were not always clean and more often than not they smelled of the stables . Most of them chewed tobacco and were great spitters , but they were always good-natured and they possessed the lazy wit and the racy humor which goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stables Johnny learned the facts of life and it was not a bad way of learning , because the attitude toward it all was big and hearty , and if minds dwelt upon sex a trifle too much , how could it have been otherwise when there was so little else to occupy them ? In most families , livery stables were regarded as dens of idleness and iniquity where all manner of vices were to be acquired and boys were forbidden by their church-going elders to hang aboutp220them . In Johnny 's family , perhaps because of his father 's passion for horses and racing-men , there were no restraints placed upon the frequentingof livery stables , and whatever he picked up there was more wholesome and less vicious than much that was whispered about in the locker-rooms of the Young Men 's Christian Association . I think Johnny and his brother must have known every livery stable in the Town and the County , and more than once , driving across country with his father during a political campaign , Johnny , i spent nights , wrapped in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ii- the big mows or on a cot by the big iron stove . There were three great stables which always filled Johnny with wonder and delight . Not far from his house stood Painter 's Stables in an alley lined with enormous sycamore trees . It was a great center of gossip and it supplied cabs for weddings and funerals . If there was a murder in Town one heard of it at Painter 's in all its gruesomedetails . At Painter 's there was always an immense amount of information regarding the amorous propensities of certain whited sepulchers among the citizenry . If a son of a deacon was arrested in the Railroad Hotel with a waitress and gave a false name in police court , the whole story was known at Painter 's as soon as it happened . There are no more horses there and the stable itself has been pulled down . With it have gone those wonderful , dark , smelly conveyances known as cabs which conveyed the citizenry with dignity to and from funerals and weddings . Gone with them is much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small child there was always great excitement in the house when one of those dark , upholsteredcabs arrived at the front door and the family set out for the station to visit Greataunt Esther or Greataunt Susan . Something of the mystery of death clung to those pompous old hacks , accumulatinga little more with each successive funeral . They smelled faintly of death just as they smelled faintly of ammonia . They were exciting . Wilmerding 's Ten Cent Barn stood a block from the Court House , near the center of the Town . It was a vast structure of wood built soon after the Civil War and it survived long after the buildings of the same era had been pulled down all around it . In winter and inp221bad weather when farmers could not leave their teams at the hitchingrailon the square , they went to Wilmerding 's , where for ten cents they could stable the horses for the whole day . It was built with huge sawn beams and had four floors , with wide steep ramps leading from one to another , so that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building . On Saturdays and market days in bad wcat her it was filled , and in the big room near the entrance there was always a little group of farmers discussing crops , prices , and politics . It was a place much frequented by Johnny 's father when he represented the farmers of the County in public office . Then there was a vast livery stable called " Grimses " where twice a month a great horse-fair took place , attended by horse-dealers and farmers from the surrounding counties . In the vast open space , littered with tanbark under the high roof , there was a constant procession of stallions and mares and geldings , Percherons and Clydes , Morgans and hacks and trotting-horses , all prancing and neighing and stepping nervously as if they were on springs , while Joe Burns , the auctioneer , a thin man with a roaring voice , who looked like Uncle Sam , stood in his pulpit beside the tanbark , calling for bids . Johnny 's father was always there , watching and hoping for a bargain , and sometimes his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Farm , were placed on sale . At one end of the big barn there was a lunch-counter where one bought hot dogs and ham sandwichesand baked beans and beer and hot coffee , and when Johnny 's father was afraid of missing a bargain , he and Johnny would eat there , but more frequently they went to the Crescent House , a couple of blocks away , where they had lunch sitting on high stools at a counter . The Crescent House was one of the relics of the past , for it had been built in the days when the Irish descended on the countryside to construct the railroads across the rich Middle West . It had been built in haste and it was a huge square box of a building without a vestige of ornamentation . Because it stood at the crossing of the Erie and Pennsylvania lines and there were always locomotives on the siding beneath its windows , it was given a coat of liver-colored paintP222every few years . It was a shade unaffected by the soot . Before the door there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half suffocated by the smoke , and from the big glass windows of the lunchroom one had a view of Trefusis Castle sitting on its hill above the Flats . It still served as a hotel frequented by firemen and engineers and brakemen who ended their runs in the Town , but no longer was there the wild drinking and gambling and occasional shootings which colored its early clays . It had the best food in Town and there were epicures v ho came all the way to the Flats to sit at its lunchcounter . It was owned and run by Mrs. Sten , a fat , solid woman who had entered its doors for the first time as a waitress during the Irish invasion and when the invasion ended she came by virtue of her talents as a cook , to own it . When Johnny was a child Mrs. Sten was already a rich and handsome old lady living in a fine brick house with big plate-glass windows , in the most fashionable part of Maple Avenue . She never entertained anyone in the big house and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day in order to see that the food was always as good as it should be . The rest of the time she sat in a rocking-chair at the plate-glass window , half concealed by an enormous , . Boston fern , watching the ' Town go past her house . To go to the Crescent House was always an occasion of festival , for Johnny 's father allowed him to eat the things children are not allowed to eat  --  great slices of cake and pieces of Mrs. Sten 's famous lemon pie . There were things to be had at that lunch-counter , such things as oyster stew and fried chicken , which Parisian gourmets have never known . For Johnny the company was as exciting as the food . Soldiers and policemen never fascinated him , for in the Town the only men who ever became soldiers were black sheep or boys who were stupid and good for nothing , and there was no special glamour about policemen when you knew every one of them by name . The heroes of Johnny 's childhood were the engineers and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pennsylvania and the Baltimore and Ohio through the Town on their way from the West to New York . To Johnny locomotives were the most beautiful things in the world , P223not only because of their power and their strength and the beauty of their lines , but because they were the engines which could take you out of the Town into the World . He knew every type of locomotive from the doddering old switch engines to the great Moguls which pulled the Erie freights up the long hill toward the West and the big high-wheeled greyhounds which drew the eight-thirty-seven , the only train which did not stop in the Town , over the rails of the Pennsylvania from Chicago to New York . When he was old enough to go off by himself he spent nearly every Saturday afternoon in the Pennsylvania yards where the big engines came in off the lines to the roundhouse to be examined and repaired . He never told his mother or father that the roundhouse was his destination , for he knew he would be forbidden to go there on account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the yards by watchmen , but always he returned , until at last he made the acquaintance of the railroad detectives and the men who worked in the repair shops and they no longer objected . I think they looked upon Johnny 's obsession as a joke and presently they came to considerhim as one of themselves . He shared their lunches , so excited by the honor on the first occasion that afterward he was sick ; and presently he was allowed to go where he pleased , wandering over the whole yards in and out and under trains . Nothing ever happened to him and he was as happy as it was possible to be . He was content to sit on a greasy stool for hours , simply watching the repair men at work , and nothing gave him such excitement as to see one of the huge locomotives , oiled , repaired , and ready for the line , start off from the roundhouse as easily and as smoothly as a toy . There was a beauty in it which was indescribable and which for Johnny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yards until after dark , and then slowly out of the fog and steam and smoke the signal lights would begin to appear here and there , ruby and yellow , mauve and green , like jewels , and then when a long train with all the windows lighted slipped past , a lump would come into Johnny 's throat . And always he said to himself , " Some day I shall get aboard one of those trainsp224and go off and travel and travel and see everything and at last find the place where I want to live forever . " When he was grown Johnny traveled and traveled , but he never found the place , or perhaps he found too many places . But great locomotives , like great ships , remained for him the most exciting and beautiful things in the world . They helped him in a strange way to understand the restlessness of The Old Man who had been a mystery to him all through his childhood . James Willingdon left the bank for politics when two of the political bosses in the northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a great future for him . Three things , I think , led them to believe that he was the material they sought  --  his charm , his easy-going ways , and his wide acquaintance among the farmers . The Republicans already had such a man  --  handsome , simple , and willing to compromise . He came from the next county and already he had done much to help the " party , " which meant that he voted as he was told by men who seldom held any office but stood in the wings , prompting and directing the performers . His name was Warren Gamaliel Harding . The Democratic Party no longer held to its old-fashioned principles . In it too there were men who believed in tariffs and believed that " business " should be helped now and then discreetly and judiciously . But the men who sought out James Willingdon failed to count upon his what they later called eccentricity and pigheadedness . They did not understand that " honesty " meant one thing to him and another to themselves , nor that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either by money or by the political honors which could be bestowed through the mechanical operation of a political machine which was not above making bargains with the opposite party . Nor did they comprehend a man who never allowed ambition to become an obsession , and saw success and money not as the whole of life , but only as a part of it . It was , in their opinion , simply mad for a man to prefer respect for himself to money and renown . He was elected at once , and no sooner was he seated in his officeP225in the big Court House than certain rich men carne to him separately and in groups to demand reductions upon the valuations of the mills and factories and houses which they owned . It was scarcely a shame . less procedure because the question of shame was not involved . They had supported him and given money toward the expenses of his election , and now that he had won they were entitled to the.r rewards . It was all a part of the game of politics and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were asking . Not very many of the citizens who elected Johnny 's father could even have defined the word " ethics . " The Republicans had had their innings and had their properties undertaxed , and now it was the turn of the men who had succeeded in driving them from influence . A poor man had no chance of having his taxes reduced , but the rich man who contributed to the party fund could have what he wanted . It was simply a question of " business . " Why should anyone drag in a question of honesty in government ? The contributions were investments and now the men who made them had a right to a return . Subtly the government itself was being taken over by business men . subt1v government was being put on the level of shopkeeping . It was a rule winch worked in Washington as well as in a moderatesizedtown in ' the Middle West . They had plenty of Senators like Aldrich and Hale and Payne and Foraker and Hanna who saw the point clearly and made no trouble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping themselves as well . When Johnny 's father refused to lower tax assessments and alter valuations his career was doomed . He liked politics , but he was not a politician in the meaning imposed upon the word by the New Era . His supporters , bewildered , stormed and fumed and argued , and one of them , himself a judge of the Court of Appeals , sat tip all one night trying to make him see that times had changed and that politics had to be " practical " if business was to go ahead and prosperity bless the country . When his term of office came to an end James Willingdon stubbornlyrefused to disappear from the picture . There was a fight within the party organization and again he was nominated and elected . TheP226farmers were behind him and in the Town there were old-timers who believed it was better to have him in office than a Republican . At least , if he were elected it would keep the Republicans out of the benefits . But it was the last time he succeeded and his career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the administration of County offices became a scandal , there was a wave of reform and 3 half-dozen men went to prison . But they were only the good-natured agreeable " men who had been placed in office because they " understood " politics . Among them were none of the business men . Somehowin American life bribe-giving had come to be accepted as conventional . Bribe-taking was a different matter , but not very much different. ' l he " agreeable " man from the next county had a great success within the Republican Party , rising from office to office , without ever making trouble for anyone until at last Senators Lodge and Penrose and a Republican boss named Harry M. Daugherty arranged for him to be nominated and elected as President . In the end he died suddenly because there was nothing else for him to do . But the rule son held . hone of the bribe-givers went to jail . It was n't quite possible to send a big business man to prison , when the government was no longer government , but only a business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still curiosities , and as most of the villages and all of the farms could not be reached by train , the electioneering had to be done in a buggy behind a team of horses . Sometimes it was a dreary business and Johnny 's father took him along on the trips and for Johnny each trip was a fresh adventure . He saw new country and new farms and occasionally a village he had never known before , and always the heaviest campaigning took place in the month of October when the days were brilliant and the nights frosty and clear . The trees had turned to brilliant reds and yellows and purples , and the corn was being shocked in the fields . Johnny always went with his father on Saturdaysand Sundays and on week days when he had been good at his lessons and was allowed a day or two of holiday . Together fatherP227and son covered the whole country and in the end Johnny came to know every road and lane and stream and to visit every farm . They always set out in the early morning just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to get a good start on the long journey . Warmly dressed , they sat covered with a horse blanket and an old buffalo robe , the last of its kind , rather mangy , with great patches where the hair had been worn off and the hide showed through ; and when they had passed the last house on the outskirts of the Town an intoxicating sense of delight swept through them . With each mile the country grew less familiar . There were new pastures and woods , new brooks and farmhouses , new valleys and hills Johnny had never seen before , all illumined by the brilliant October light . The trees and houses cast the long blue shadows of early morning . At each farm they stopped to chat for a while . Sometimes the men had already begun the winter plowing and were in the fields , and sometimes they were husking corn from the fodder-shocks . Johnny and his father always took a hand in the work . Sometimes they assisted at hog ringings and butchering . They husked corn , carted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and held the milk-pail while the greedy calves buried their heads up to the eyes in the warm foaming milk . They did a hundred things which were fascinating to a small boy , and at noon they were always invited to stay for dinner at the farm they were visiting when the clock struck the hour . Usually there was a delay , and Johnny and his father always knew that it had occurred because the farmer 's wife was making a special effort for visitors and was piling the table high with food . They were enormous meals at which Johnny was allowed to gorge himself , for what is the digestion of a small boy weighed against the votes to be won by pleasing the farmer 's wife ? The more they ate the more popular they were . Until Johnny was twenty-five he had recurrent indigestion caused , I think , partly by the gorgings of pie and cake which took place at the Crescent House on the day of the horse-fair , and partly because he had been made a political sacrifice in his childhood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pork with mashed potatoes and fried sweet potatoes , beans and turnips , cole slaw , sweet corn , pie , cake and coffee . But what Johnny liked best were the arrays of fatal side dishes like small bird-baths by which your plate was surrounded . These were filled with lima beans and dried corn , piccalilli and succotash and gherkins and dozens *f other things which have been forgotten . I think the tradition of side dishes found its way into the Middle West from Germany by way of the Pennsylvania Dutch country . After that early training Johnny never learned to like one thing served at a time in the French manner . Later in life nothing , it seemed to Johnny , could be more unappetizing than a few string beans set down in barren loneliness on a large , cold , white plate . But then , he was feasting in those days in a land of plenty and not in a thrifty country where a green vegetable is regarded as a luxury . When the lunch was finished the two always sat a spell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's father and his host talked politics and farming . They made their departure at the moment James Willingdon thought tactful . After dinner they continued the journey from farm to farm until nightfall , and if they were not too far away from home they returned for the night , but more frequently they stayed at a farmhouse or at a village hotel and sometimes at the livery stable . It was a wonderful moment when Johnny 's father said , " I do n't think we 'll try to get back tonight . " Whenever there was a family reunion or a " homecoming " Johnny and his father were present . A " homecoming " was a celebration given by one of the villages for the sons and daughters who had gone away to live in the cities . A great many returned , and on the occasion there were barrels of free beer and cider in the square and oxen and sheep were roasted whole , over huge fires . The fire department gave an exhibition and the local band a concert , and the old people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had returned , amusing themselves until far into the night . But the next day they went away again and the dying villages were left to the old people . P229In THE midst of the campaigning and political uproar The Old Man sat aloof in his room over the kitchen , taking no part in any of it . Sometimes he must have been drawn into discussing politics with his friend , the General , for the General , like old Jamie , had a crusader 's spirit and he spent much of his time trying to kindle a feeling of indignation against the mockery of government which surrounded him ; but he was alone , like Canute ordering the waves to conic no farther . He died before the worst of the Ohio gangs was elevated to Washington . The Old Man probably mocked him if he discussed politics at all. , He was older than any of them , not only in years , but in cynical wisdom . Beside him the General and old Jamie were little boys full of faith . It was as if The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all those who surrounded him were crude , enthusiastic , optimistic , and unmoral , believing only in one faith  --  the inevitable success and prosperity of the United States in general and the State of Ohio in particular . In the midst of all the political hubbub there was something Godlike in his detachment and cynicism . Old Jamie never remained aloof and found satisfaction only where the fight was most fierce . He fought until he was too feeble and childish to fight any longer . Once he had been a Republican because he was an Abolitionist , but by nature and principle he had always been a Jeffersonian Democrat , and once he left the Republican Party for good and found himself allied with the party which professed to follow the teachings of Jefferson , he felt freer and more happy . When Johnny was born the battle was no longer over Secession and Abolition , but a struggle between farmer and industrialist , the county and the city . He must have known that he fought on the losing side , but , P230like a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on fighting gallantly . On the other side there was power , wealth , dishonor , corruption , tariffs , and all the instruments of great manufacturers and bankers , many of whom , in another time and in another country , would have been judged criminals . But in the ' nineties and the beginning of the twentieth century there was no one to judge them save a few conscientious men within the RepublicanParty and the mass of Americans belonging still to a dying tradition who saw political power slipping farther and farther from them . It was the epoch , too , of jingoism and fantastic talk of an American Empire . Out of it all carne the " Populist " Party and the " Granges " and the free-silver movement and other efforts to help the farmers . Old Jamie was one of the first Populists and he organized the Patrons of Husbandry in his county to fight against the thievery of the railroads . The opposition brought out its time-worn weapons and denounced all Grangers as " enemies of society " and above all else of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words " Red " and " Bolshevist " to cast about carelessly in the direction of anyone who threatened the strongholds of money and privilege . The menace of the " Grangers " was pitifully small . What could a million and a half citizens accomplish against the interests intrenched in Washington and the State Capitols where legislators were always in the market to sell their services ? In some of the Western states which were purely agricultural the Grange did succeed in passing laws establishing railroad rates , and the cry went up from the big men of the New Era that this was Socialism , which was the worst word they could think of at that time . But that was an era of despair when few citizens , I think , ever hoped that men like Rockefeller could be made to behave decently and that men like Fall would ever be brought to justice . The Patrons of Husbandry faded into obscurity as a political force , and in the County , where it still remained alive for a time as an organization , it came to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets among the farmers . No oneP231objected to farmers meeting to discuss such harmless subjects as grafting and the cinch-bug . And it endured as a social organization serving to bring together once or twice at great picnics the farmers and their families . When Johnny left the County forever , the old Grange Hall was still standing , but no one had come there for years and the roof was falling in . The old farmers had gone , and with them their tradition , and in their place there were only immigrant peasant farmers who had never heard of the West , the frontier or Jefferson or the Patrons of Husbandry . It was always the name of Bryan which caused the greatest rows on the occasions of big family dinners . On the subject of Bryan there was an impregnable alliance between Johnny 's father and old Jamie , for James Willingdon was an unregenerate Democrat who would vote for anything which was not Republican , and old Jamie was a Mugwump and regarded Bryan at the beginning of his career as a kind of Messiah come into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two held the fort against most of the others in the family . Old Jamie believed in the Populist Party as he believed in the Grange , and although he had doubts about free silver he was willing to give it a try ; at that time things could not have been much worse and any change might turn out to be an improvement . He had no faith in the mystical omnipotence of bankers and felt that they knew no more about economics than preachers knew about God . He could virtually recite the whole of the Cross of Gold speech in his great chesty voice , and he respected the young Bryan for one quality which he himself possessed  --  that of placing faith and conscience and ideals , however faulty their dictates , above bargaining and compromise . And he believed that Bryan , even as a thinker , was superior to most of those who in one way or another ruled the country . Bryan 's sincerity , he would shout , was no mean quality in a country cursed with damned pussy-footing , pocket-picking politicians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's limitations would forever prevent him from really achieving anything , he never confessed his doubts in the presence of his Republican sons . Bryan raised the only standardabout which the farmers and the last of the frontiersmen couldP231rally . Johnny 's father , having once worked in a bank , privately thought Bryan 's free-silver platform dangerous , but in the presence of the enemy he never admitted his distrust . On the contrary , he unscrupulously used his banker 's patter to confuse and confound his less technically informed brothers-in-law and prove that free silver was salvation . However upright may have been the public political principles of old Jamie and James Willingdon , in a family political argument they became crafty and unscrupulous and used any weapon which came to hand . In a family political quarrel , quarter was neither asked nor received . Old Jamie 's children , all save the youngest who died when he was twenty , were big men and women with great chests and bosoms and stentorian voices , and a political argument about the patriarch 's groaning table quickly became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often than not the debaters placed faith in the loudest voice rather than the best argument . As a child Johnny grew impatient at never being able to speak or , if he spoke , to be heard . In the heat of those arguments the requests , the desires , even the bodies of the grandchildren were trampled under foot . So far as Johnny could see or remember no one of the debaters ever had his convictions altered in the least . They were a very American family , endowed with a goodly share of hysteria . Passions ran high and logic and facts counted for little . Prejudices always won out when at last , overcome one by one with the drowsiness which follows overeating , or exhausted by the violence of the argument , the discussion finally died away and each one of them remained as fixed in his original beliefs as when it all began . But a fine time was had by all . Sometimes the heat of the discussion attained too high a degree and one of the brothers or sisters became personal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise and leave the table angrily with the superior manner of one finding the discussion beneath his intellectuallevel . Immediately he would be followed in a body by the women seeking peace and reconciliation ; but the ensuing conference , like so many others of infinitely greater importance to the world , would end only in spreading trouble , for Aunt Ruby would assertP233that her husband , Uncle Herbert , had been insulted and was perfectlyright in leaving the table , and at that remark Johnny 's mother would say that Uncle Herbert was a fool and that he had been quite wrong in all he said , and the other women would take sides , and so it would begin all over again . The peace conference carne to nothing because each of them demanded peace and victory without concession , and each woman had the conviction that her husband was really a great statesman whose talents had not been recognized and that all the others were merely fools . All those uncles and aunts were as unlimited in prejudice as in vitality , and in the spectacle they created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him later on the peculiar , quality of American life . They were intelligent , exceedingly healthy , passionate people of colossal vitality , scarcely educated at all in the classical sense , but full of practical education . One is tempted to say that they possessed Yankee common sense , but on examinationone discovers quickly that this was not true . One was misled by the solidity of their physical appearance . They all looked , like most Americans , as if they should have had common sense , but the fact was that they had very little and that at heart they were incurably romantic , all of them , and Johnny 's mother most of all . Common sense , thrift , practical qualities , despite legends to the contrary , do not go with frontiersmen , and they were all children by blood , tradition , and experience of the frontier . If the men who conquered the wilderness of America had been thrifty and cautious shopkeepers , they would never have adventured into the wilderness . If they had had common sense and been interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they would not have been forced , like so many ( le . frauded Revolutionary veterans , to seek salvation in the hardships of the frontier . The qualities of vitality and endurance , of resourcefulnessand romance , they had in abundance . Of the shopkeeper or the settled peasant there was nothing in them . Few things could ba farther apart than the European peasant and the American farmer of old Jamie 's day . It never occurred to any of those uncles and aunts to take a shopP234or a piece of land and stick to it for the rest of their lives , building up a small fortune through solid economies . They were always seeking the end of the rainbow and all of them died or will die some day in the belief that one day they will strike it rich . And so they were possessed of an undisciplined restlessness which drove them from place to place , from adventure to adventure , from one undertakingto another in all parts of the country . If one thing failed , they abandoned it and set out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the faintest attachment to any house or piece of land . They married and some of them brought into the world large families , but even seven or eight children did not succeed in settling them . The disease of wandering continued with all of them until long after middle age , when at last , one by one , they settled , most of them in the Far West where there still remained a sense of space , of freedom , and of adventure . Uncle John once wrote to Johnny 's mother from the mountains of Oregon , " You should come out here and let your children grow up where there is still elbow room and where they wo n't grow up just like everybody else . " Uncle John married a woman who had one child after another , so easily that the aunts said when her pains came on that it was impossible to get her to a bed before the child was born . She was a strong woman and she gave birth to ten strong children , all of whom grew up to be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Considering the life they led as children , they had need to be vigorous . As a child Johnny envied them , for they seemed to him to lead the most romantic adventurous life , always traveling , never remaininglong in one spot . Between adventures they returned to the Farm , sometimes with one parent and sometimes with both , to pass an interim in the house of old Jamie until some new plan was undertaken . When they arrived the character of the big farmhouse was changed and for the time of their visit the sacred parlor was defiled by being made into a bedroom to shelter two or three of them . It was no simple problem to feed and shelter twelve people who descended upon you without a word of warning , but Johnny 's grandparentsaccepted the erratic visitations without complaint and evenP235with pleasure , for I think they would have liked it if all their children and grandchildren had remained with them on the Farm until they ( lied . The arrival of Uncle John 's family always meant delight to the other grandchildren , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children to play with . Their mother , Aunt HIlda , was a romantic woman and consequently a rather slatternly housekeeper , and she brought with her to Jamie 's and Maria 's house not only the burden of her family but of her incorrigible untidiness as well . Perhapsif she had been able to lead a more settled life she would have been a greater success as a housekeeper . There was much to be said in her defense against the perpetual criticism of the energetic sisters-in-law to whom she was a scandal . Her children suffered from her romantic nature , for they were all named after characters in the novels of Walter Scott . One was called Rob Roy , and another Rowena . The children of Uncle John were the only descendants of the Colonel who carried out the pioneer tradition to the very end . They all settled at last in the State of Washington , where they married farmers or established themselves as farmers , all save two sons who became engineers and gave up their lives to building roads and dams and subduing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Canada , living the year round in the open on horseback . Sometimes in the East and in Europe , filled with a hunger for a country " where there is still elbow room , " Johnny as a man felt an obscure envy of them and experienced a sense of having taken a wrong turning somewhere long ago when he was too young to know better . The second uncle , Harry , was a great sport and the blood of the family . He was the biggest of seven big brothers and sisters , both in height and in girth , of a boisterous and Rabelaisian personality , and of them all Johnny 's memory of him always remained the clearest . He too led a roving life , but in a financial way he was always more successful than the others . It seemed to Johnny that he had been everywhere and had seen everything , and he had a gift for telling the stories of his adventures and describing the wonders he hadp236seen to the stay-at-homes of the family . The news that Uncle Harry was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family life , for he was one of those personalities who on entering a room seemed to bring into it a curious current of vitality which charged all the others present . Even the children , who understood nothing of " personality , " were aware that here was some one who " lived " in a large way . Johnny 's mother and his aunts were intensely respectable women , critical of any laxity of morals on the part of others , but with them it appeared that Uncle Harry was hors de concours . They knew he was gay , they knew he had lived with actresses , but it seemed to make no difference . It was as if men like Uncle Harry had a special power even over respectable women which set them apart in a privileged class . 1 do not know how it was that he alone of all the children in a respectable Presbyterian family should have escaped a consciousness of sin . But he had none . He just lived . It gave him a great charm and an attraction for others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the old Colonel who came out from Maryland , bringing the end of the eighteenth century with him . But he had , too , the colossal vigor and physique of old Jamie . Uncle Harry liked rather flashy clothes and dressed with the exuberanceof one who enjoyed life and found satisfaction in being a big handsome fellow . Johnny 's clearest memories of him were always associated with his arrivals , when the children ran to the door to meet him and receive the extravagant presents he always brought in his big valise of crocodile skin . Coming up the path to the slate-gray house , you could hear his shouted greetings before he reached the door . In winter he wore a brown derby hat and a yellow covert-cloth box coat which ended just above his knees . He liked fancy cravats and wore a big diamond pin in his tie and a diamond ring on his big carefully kept hands . He ate enormously and smoked excellent cigars , and the aroma of tobacco smoke was inevitably associated with the memory of him . Despite or perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother of Johnny 's mother , and I think that part of the reason for her devotion to him lay in the vague glamour which he had for a woman who by circumstance and a rigid sensep271of duty was condemned to a routine humdrum existence in a small town . Of all her family she was the only one who did not roam and sec the world . As Johnny grew a little older he became aware that there was a scandal about Uncle Harry which the children were not permitted to know and which was discussed only in mysterious whispers . Sometimes the children overheard their elders talking about somebodycalled Eva who had something to do with Uncle Harry . The mysterious Eva was always spoken of in tones of condemnation and scorn . Then one day Johnny discovered what the scandal was . Uncle Harry was divorced ! When Johnny was much older he learned the whole commonplace story . Eva was a pretty woman and Uncle Harry was always leaving her alone in Indianapolis , in order to go to San Francisco or New York . One day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stained with macassar oil ! " ( as Johnny 's aunts described them scornfully ) in Eva 's bedroom . In the bosom of Johnny 's mother and her sisters there was no forgiveness for Eva nor any charity regarding her sin on the grounds that her husband himself was " gay " and left her much alone . To them it was simply unthinkable that any woman could have been unfaithful to the handsome Harry . For a long time Uncle Harry was the manager for his brother Robert , who was first amateur and then professional sprinting champion in the world of bicycle-racing . It was before the days of automobile-racing and baseball and a bicycle champion was as much a hero as Babe Ruth . Together the brothers traveled all over the United States making century runs and winning sprinting-races , Johnny 's memory of Uncle Robert was dim save for the fact that he was handsome and an athlete and that when he returned to the Town , celebrations and receptions were given in his honor . It was his melodramatic death and the effect it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallery of uncles and aunts . He was killed in a railroad accident worthy of the great moving-picture spectacles , when the train on which he was traveling from San Franciscoplunged , during a wild thunderstorm , through a washed-outP238bridge into the bottom of a ravine two hundred feet below . The children were told none of the details directly , but , overhearing them , they pieced them together from sentences and phrases picked up here and there until the parts reconstructed themselves into a whole which was fantastically picturesque and dramatic . Johnny re-created the whole scene in his imagination with such vividness that thirty years afterward he still had a perfect picture in his memory of a place which had never existed but which he could describe in detail . It was a deep canyon , narrow and dark , with a black rushing torrent flowing at the bottom , and at the top , a narrow arched bridge which gave way , crumbling , to drop a whole train of sleeping passengersinto the dark waters below . He remembered Uncle Harry saying , " If only Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet toward the engine , he would be alive today . " Uncle Robert 's body was found in the berth where he died in his sleep . His neck was broken from the shock of having been thrown against the end of the berth . Otherwise he was uninjured . The speech of Uncle Harry haunted Johnny ever afterward , deranging every voyage he ever made on a night train . Always he debated whether or not he should change the berth and sleep with his feet toward the engine . And always , thinking , " If I do n't do it just this once , something will happen , " he changed the pillow and bed clothes in order to go to bed traveling feet first . Uncle Robert was a champion and he was handsome , and a good many women tried to marry him , but in the end he married a beauty , one of two sisters famed for their looks in the San Francisco of their day . They were the daughters of a man named Hackenschmidtwho came from Germany during the troubles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he opened the most spectacularbazaar and jewelry shop the world had ever seen . It had nuggets and bars of gold and real jewels set into the wall , and in the great days of California Hackenschmidt did a huge business selling diamonds to gamblers and men who came down from the mountains with great bags of gold dust . One of the sisters was blond and the other brunette , and they were inseparable . It was said that peopleP239turned in the street to look at them , and that strangers were told that they had not seen all the wonders of San Francisco until they had seen the Hackenschmidt sisters . Both of them had clothes from Paris and dressed always in the latest fashion , long before the new styles had reached American small towns . There still exists a wedding picture with the two sisters , Greta , whom Uncle Robert married , and her sister Jo , both dressed in the height of fashion with enormous sleeves and tiny waists and aigrettes in their hair . Aunt Greta was looked upon by Johnny 's mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but even this was nothing to the sin of having married Uncle Robert , the baby of the family . So the visits of Aunt Greta to the Willingdon household were always marked by a certain coldness , which she either failed to notice or ignored . It was whispered among the aunts that she was horribly extravagant and made dreadful hysterical scenes , behaving altogether like a professional beauty and ruining the life of Uncle Robert . I think the powerful aunts were as unjust to her as they were to the romantic , untidy Aunt Hilda . She was beautiful with a quality of brilliance in her beauty which made her seem hard , and undoubtedly , because she was a spoiled beauty , there were times when she seemed selfish and imperious , but I can not see why she should have married Johnny 's Uncle Robert , save for love , because she could have done far better for herself . She was accused of " putting on airs " and of deliberately trying to shock the people of the Town when she came on a visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conscious one , she must be forgiven . She came from San Francisco at a time when San Francisco was perhaps the most civilized and fascinating city in America , where conformity was considered mediocrity and extravagant individualism was encouragedand applauded . Grown up overnight of citizens from every country in the world , San Francisco had a wild , reckless , and generouscharacter of its own , far removed from the desiccated propriety of Boston or the English mold which New York society attempted to ape . And out of this colorful background Aunt Greta stepped into the midst of a solid Scotch family in a community molded by New England tradition , to find herself surrounded by the hostilityP240of disapproving sisters-in-law . It was a community wherein the mention of physical love was commonly regarded as shameful , wherein respectable women were supposed to submit themselves with distasteto the desires of their husbands , and a woman who found pleasure in love was no better than a trollop . To all this Aunt Greta , who was a South German and a San Franciscan , would never have subscribed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or with a horrifying directness , she let the women know of her passion for the handsome Uncle Robert . The sister Jo was more beautiful than Aunt Greta . She was dark and tall , with a superb figure , and looked rather like Anna Held . Once or twice she accompanied Aunt Greta on a visit . Johnny always remembered lice as she was at Uncle Robert 's funeral , seated in dazzling contrast beside her blond sister , both of them dressed in black clothes which were denounced as " freakish and undignified " because they were smart . A little black veil covered her eyes and the tip of her upturned nose . When they appeared on the streets of the Town they never failed to create a small sensation . Women gathered disapprovingly to stare after them and whisper , like hens when a hawk appears in the skies overhead . I think they both enjoyed the excitement , for neither of them was above liking to attract attention . Afterward Jo became an actress and died a tragic death when she slipped on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tub of scalding water . There was a full page in the magazine section of the Chicago Record-Herald , with the story of her life and her love affairs and pictures showing her beauty . Aunt Greta 's colorful life began in San Francisco . After Uncle Robert died she came back once or twice to visit Johnny 's mother , and then no more was heard of her . She simply disappeared and whether she was dead or alive no member of the family knew for nearly thirty years . Then after she had almost been forgotten Johnny 's mother went into a shop on Fifth Avenue to buy a hat , and the saleswoman who came toward her was Aunt Greta . She was no longer rich , and what had happened to her during all those years.  |p241save  that she had married again , no one ever discovered . At fifty she was handsome and as smartly dressed as ever , hut all the luxury which surrounded her in her youth had vanished forever . It . was not dreams of New York which fascinated Johnny in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Uncle Robert knew every big city in the country , but for them there was only one which stood apart from . all the others by its glitter and charm and color . Uncle Harry looked upon New York as a rather drab provincial town by the side of San Francisco , and I suspect he was right . New York , whether it was the New York of Henry James or of O. Henry and Madison Square Garden ( which was probably the one Uncle Harry knew best ) , must have been a stuffy place beside San Francisco . New York , the uncles said , had nothing which could equal the picturesqueness of the Barbary Coast , or the brilliance of the Cliff House or the luxury of the Palace Hotel , nor was there a single restaurant , even Delmonico 's , in New York which could compare with any one of a half dozen in San Francisco . As a child Johnny longed to go to San Francisco as a Calvinist longs to go to heaven . The Cliff House with its sea food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carriages drawn by high-stepping horses and filled with beautiful women , seemed to him the apotheosis of all that was worldly and beautiful and exciting . When he went there for the first time twentyfiveyears later , on a sentimental visit , nothing remained but the sea lions . In place of the high-stepping horses there were only a few dreary taxicabs . The Barbary Coast had vanished and Chinatown was a cluster of tourist shops . Most of the famous restaurants were gone , slowly throttled by prohibition . Yet something remained  --  something which had the softness and the color of a city which was not American . In the south of California there was a great boom city , born of the New Era , but nothing could have been more different in charm or beauty or tradition . Aunt Ruby was a big , powerful woman who married a little man and dominated him for the rest of his life . He was a quiet , docileP242fellow and would have liked , I think , to settle down in a corner and remain there , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so he was dragged and buffeted hack and forth , up and down around the whole of the United States until Aunt Ruby felt she had seen and experienced all she desired and settled down at last in Oregon . In all their restless life he was never given time to establish himself anywhere , for Aunt Ruby was always seeking the foot of the rainbow and had n't the patience to stick with any economic experimentlong enough for it to prove either successful or unsuccessful . Hers was a nature which demanded either immediate success or the excitement of travel and adventure . As she never achieved immediate success , her life was given up entirely to travel . It always seemed to Johnny that somehow the sexes had become confused in the case of Aunt Ruby and Uncle Herbert . She should have been dressed in trousers and he in petticoats . It was a happy marriage and finally burned itself out into the peaceful companionship of old age . Aunt Ruby 's husband scarcely ever spoke without glancing deferentially at her as if to ask for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no opinions which were not pale shadows of her own violent prejudices . I think that he was one of those feeble men who would always have been timid and wretched without some powerful woman to make his decisions , order his life , and arrange his day for him . The relationshipused to puzzle Johnny ; he was only a child then and knew nothing of theories of sexual compensation . Aunt Annie was a slightly paler edition of Johnny 's mother , Ellen , and Aunt Ruby . She married a tall , lanky man who was the proprietorof a comfortable small hotel in one of the few prosperous villages of the County . He had inherited the hotel from his father and would have been content to die there . It was a charming old building of brick which stood on the edge of a little river where the fishing was good , and he asked only to be left in peace to look after the needs of his guests and fish from the terrace when he had nothing else to do , which was a great part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of leading so dull a- life , and after a fees years she persuaded him to sell the hotel , and she , too , accompaniedP243by her husband , took to the road looking for the end of the rainbow . She , too , led him over all the Middle West and the West . She never found any pot of gold , but in the end , after middle age , she settled in southern California , where he promptly died , worn out , I think , Irons constant traveling and the companionship of so vital a woman . Johnny 's mother , like many Scotswomen , had a fair complexion , blue eyes , and black hair , and like the rest of her family she was built upon magnificent lines . She was one of those people who in this world appear to collect responsibilities as a sheep collects burrs , and from the time she was a child it was always to her that Johnny 's grandmother , Maria , looked for aid in everything . She was a middle child in the family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sisters , even the ones who were older than herself . Even in the cradle there must have been something about her which caused the others to unload burdens and responsibilities on her . She must have suffered countless hours of boredom during her life listening to the confidences of other women , more vain and silly than herself , who sought her advice and sympathy and insisted upon telling her all their real troubles and a great many which did not exist at all . Yet I think that her nature would have been cramped and starved without confidences and responsibilities and burdens , for in a way , as Johnny 's tither used to say in a rare outburst of acidity , she went out looking 1 or them . She was the one in Maria 's family who helped with the housekeepingand gardening and in the dairy and cared for the younger children , and when old Jamie found that , in the changing times , it was impossible economically to provide the education he desired for all his eight children , it was his daughter Ellen whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be spared the least . She had always a passionate love for music , but there was never either the time or the money for her to have lessons , and so , while her sisters who had no taste for music were given lessons , she patiently taught herself to play a few tunes on the melodeon in the dark parlor , She married young and the wedding photograph shows her dressed in a tight barque with innumerable tiny buttons following the flow/ing lines of an ample figure . She wears a pert bustle and a bang falling to her eyes . She and James Willingdon married for love , since neither of them was rich and there was no other possible reason . He had only his salary as a bank cashier out of which he supported his parents and sometimes helped his brother , who was a wild fellow and uncertain support for a wife and large family . By her marriage Ellen Ferguson escaped none of the responsibilities and burdens of her early life ; she only took on a new set which added their weight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very little money she shared a big house with her mother-in-law and with The Old Man on the occasions when he deigned to return from his wanderings on a visit . When , at last , she had a house of her own , it was an ex tremely rare occasion when she had it all to herself and her family . Almostat once it became a sort of hotel for relatives , aunts and uncles and cousins who were in financial troubles , greataunts who had losttheir husbands or quarreled with one another , cousins come back to pay a visit to the home town . Whenever there was a wedding or a funeral in the family it took place in her house . The great aunts came upon visits which extended themselves for months . When one of the family was ill he or she came to stay with her until he had recovered or died . There were times when the situation must have been unendurable , most of all for Johnny 's father , but in the patience of his nature he never complained , and in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a magnet . She had not the heart to send the relatives on their way , and if she had , I think , something would have been missingfrom her existence . Her hospitality was her way of expression and she always lived her own destiny to the full . James Willingdon was certainly not a rich man and he had no gift for money making , but whatever he attempted to save was eaten up by relatives , his own and his wife 's . Money , either in its abundance or in its scarcity , did not trouble him very profoundly , but I think there must have been times when he was driven to distraction by the interference and the unasked advice of great aunts and sisters-in-law and cousins . His wife'sP245fancily was not one to hold its tongue or to exercise tact in any circumstance , and I know that if Johnny 's parents had taken one-half the advice offered them upon the upbringing of their children , their offspring would have ended in a madhouse . All her life Johnny 's mother had a colossal strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more often than not burned itself out without accomplishing very much . A proper education , or some hard training which would have taught her to think straight and to control her emotions and organize her great powers of intelligence and energy , would have changed the whole course of her existence and made her perhaps a happier woman . She found satisfaction in her children , but she was an ambitious woman and suffered all her life from a sense of bafflement . She did not even have the satisfaction of achieving her ambitions vicariously , like old Sapphira , through her husband ; for the life of James Willingdon moved in a , slower rhythm , so gentle and placid that at times she grew ill from the accumulated exasperation of attempting to spur his worldly ambitions . It was unthinkable in her day and with her background that she should have gone into business , yet that was where she belonged . She could , like the old Sapphira , have managed her household and brought up her family and still have run a business with more energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother and wife . For thirty years she gave her life to her husband and children . She protected them , cared for them , made sacrifices for them , sometimes bitter sacrifices . Occasionally she spoiled them and nearly always she allowed herself to be trampled upon by them , although in this again I think that her nature demanded it . She was less like a bird defendingher nestlings than a lioness protecting her cubs . Her own children were unspeakably brilliant and good and clever and all other children were inferior beings . She was a great primitive force , like a thunderstorm . There were times when in the intensity of her devotion she threatened to devour her children without ever having the least consciousness of what she was doing ; and if any one of them had been lessP179corruption in the government was often enough regarded as unbalancedand dangerous . Certainly he had no chance whatever in politics . The religion of Business required conformity , else how was the country to prosper ? And in a good many houses in the Fourth Ward there was at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Colonel nor that of old Jamie , nor that of Thomas Jefferson , but strident and bullying . The War with Spain had just been won . The Spanish fleets were beneath fathoms of water at Santiago and in Manila Bay . Everythingwas " bully " with the colonel of the Rough Riders , and Senator Lodge was weaving a mesh of chicanery and bad faith to force the American people into a wild career of imperialism . It was a crude decade and not a very pretty one , and perhaps the boys in the school yard were no worse than their elders . Certainly there were plenty of models about on whom to pattern their behavior . Perhaps there were in the Town too many of those dark people imported from Poland and the Mediterranean to work in the factories and the mills . Perhaps America had indigestion from trying to swallow too much cheap labor . Perhaps here and there there were citizens who were sometimes frightened . Every schoolboy knew that it was the immigrantswho made strikes and hurt business . They all knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But none of these reasons made the lot of Herman any easier . Long afterward , when Johnny 's own children went to school in foreign countries , they were received in a kindly fashion and were neither mocked for their accent nor for their manners . Long afterwardin those same countries Johnny was forced , until he was weary of it , to defend American children against accusations of atrocious manners and American business men against accusations of brutality , ruthlessness , and sharp dealing ; and at last , thinking of these things , it seemed to him that the trail of those accusations led back over the years to the school yard of the Fourth Ward school . It was not , he thought , that American business men were any worse than those of other countries . Often enough they were more honorable , and even when brutal more straightforward , than the others . It wasp180rather that America itself , from the children in the school yard to the greatest of the bankers , was , above all the others , a nation dominated by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor the other has ever made good manners , or fineness of thought or of feeling . In that Laurel Avenue school Johnny was taught an incredible number of lies about the War of the Revolution , about the War of 1812 , about the Mexican War , about the Spanish-American War . All redskins were cruel savages who preyed upon innocent , generous , well -- meaning settlers . All British were oppressors and tyrants . Very little attention was directed toward the achievements of which Americans might well be proud . It was as if all the energy of those men who outlined the history books was expended in glossing over the depredationsand dishonest acts of the American government , so that little was left to discern and describe the more gracious achievements . Johnny was taught that the Spanish were a decadent race addicted to the most fiendish cruelty , that the Spanish-American War was one of pure altruism , that the imperialist manipulations of men like Lodge and Roosevelt were motivated only by Christian charity . He was even taught that there was no virtue in the Southern states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half the Southerners were the direct descendants of Simon Legree and the rest of Benedict Arnold . Once a month , at the behest of some female crank , each class of children was called upon to stand and , placing one hand over the heart , and then raising the right hand , to parrot in piping voices , " I give my heart and my head and my hand to my country . " There was also something idiotic about my country right or wrong , but that , fortunately , Johnny forgot . I do not know what good this special piece of asininity was to accomplish , but I suppose it was to fill the budding citizens with a blind enthusiasm for a government ( and so for themselves ) regardless of its folly , its corruption and hypocrisy . There was even an effort made to make us believe that the President was a sacrosanctcreature , incapable of wrong , yet at home Johnny had heard of McKinley and Hanna and he knew that his own State had produced a whole crop of feeble Presidents and crooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per agreement . He had warned me that if he did n't answer it would mean that he was sleeping with someone , probably his Georgia cunt . Anyway , there he was , tucked away comfortably , but with an air of weariness as usual . He wakes up cursing himself , or cursing the job , or cursing life . He wakes up utterly bored and discomfited , chagrined to think that he did not die overnight . I sit down by the window and give him what encouragementI can . It is tedious work . One has to actually coax him out of bed . Mornings  --  he means by mornings anywherebetween one and five p.m.  --  mornings , as I say , he gives himself up to reveries . Mostly it is about the past he dreams . About his " cunts . " He endeavors to recall how they felt , what they said to him at certain critical moments , where he laid them , and so on . And as he lies there , grinning and cursing , he manipulates his fingers in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convey the impression that his disgust is too great for words . Over the bedstead hangs a douche bag which he keeps for emergencies  --  forthe virgins whom he tracks down like a sleuth . Even after he has slept with one of these mythical creatures he will still refer to her as a virgin , and almost never by name . " My virgin , " he will say , just as he says " my Georgia cunt . " When he goes to the toilet he says : " If my Georgia cunt calls tell her to wait . Say I said so . And listen , you can have her if you like . I 'm tired of her . " He takes a squint at the weather and heaves a deepp101sigh . If it 's rainy he says : " God damn this fucking climate , it makes one morbid . " And if the sun is shining brightly he says : " God damn that fucking sun , it makes you blind ! " As he starts to shave he suddenly remembers that there is no clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're too stingy to give you a clean towel every day ! " No matter what he does or where he goes things are out of joint . Either it 's the fucking country or the fucking job , or else it 's some fucking cunt who 's put him on the blink . " My teeth are all rotten , " he says , gargling his throat . " It 's the fucking bread they give you to eat here . " He opens his mouth wide and pulls his lower lip down . " See that ? Pulled out six teeth yesterday . Soon I 'll have to get another plate . That 's what you get working for a living . When I was on the bum I had all my teeth , my eyes were bright and clear . Look at me now ! It 's a wonder I can make a cunt any more . Jesus , what I 'd like is to find some rich cunt  --  like that cute little prick , Carl . Did he ever show you the letters she sends him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't tell me her name , the bastard . . . he 's afraid I might take her away from him . " He gargles his throat again and then takes a long look at the cavities . " You 're lucky , " he says ruefully . " You 've got friends , at least . I have n't anybody , except that cute little prick who drives me bats about his rich cunt . " " Listen , " he says , " do you happen to know a cunt by the name of Norma ? She hangs around the Dame all day . I think she 's queer . I had her up here yesterday , tickling her ass . She would n't let me do a thing . I had her on the bed . . . . I even had her drawers off ... and then I got disgusted . Jesus , I ca n't bother struggling that way any more . It is n't worth it . Either they do or they do n't  --  it 's foolish to waste time wrestling with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there may be a dozen cunts on the terrasse just dying to be laid . It 's a fact . They all come over here to get laid . They think it 's sinful here . . . the poor boobs ! Some of these schoolteachers from out West , they 're honestly virgins . . . I mean it ! They sit around on their can all day thinking about it . You do n't have to work over them very much . They 're dying for it . I had a married woman the other day who told me she had n't had a lay for six months . Can you imagine that ? Jesus , she was hot ! I thought she 'd tear the cock off me . And groaning all the time . " Do you ? Do you ? " She kept saying that all the time , like she was nuts . And do you know what that bitch wanted to do ? She wanted to move in here . Imagine that ! Asking me if I. loved her . I did n't even know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't want to . The married ones ! Christ , if you saw all the married cunts I bring up here you 'd never have any more illusions . They 're worse than the ; virgins , the married ones . They do n't wait for you to start things  --  they fish it out for you themselves . And then they talk about love afterwards . It 's disgusting . I tell you , I 'm actually beginning to hate cunt ! " I le looks out the window again . It 's drizzling . It 's been drizzling this way for the last five days . " Are we going to the Dome , Joe ? " I call him Joe because he calls me Joe . When Carl is with us he is Joe too . Everybody is Joe because it 's easier that way . It 's also a pleasant reminder not to take yourself too seriously . Anyway , Joe does n't want to go to the Dome  --  he owes too much money there . He wants to go to the Coupole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But it 's raining , Joe . " " I know , but what the hell ! I 've got to have my constitutional . I 've got to wash the dirt out of my belly . " p 103When he says this I have the impression that the whole world is wrapped up there inside his belly , and that it 's rotting there . As he 's putting on his things he falls back again into a semi-comatose state . He stands there with one arm in his coat sleeve and his hat on assways and he begins to dream aloud  --  about the Riviera , about the sun , about lazing one 's life away . " All I ask of life , " he says , " is a bunch of books , a bunch of dreams , and a bunch of cunt . " As he mumbles this meditatively he looks at me with the softest , the most insidious smile . " Do you like that smile ? " he says . And then disgustedly  --  " Jesus , if I could only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Only a rich cunt can save me now , " he says with an air of utmost weariness . " One gets tired of chasing after new cunts all the time . It gets mechanical . The trouble is , you see , I ca n't fall in love . I 'm too much of an egoist . Women only help me to dream , that 's all . It 's a vice , like drink or opium . I 've got to have a new one every day ; if I do n't I get morbid . I think too much . Sometimes I 'm amazed at myself , how quick I pull it off  --  and how little it really means . I do it automatically like . Sometimes I 'm not thinking about a woman at all , but suddenly I notice a woman looking at me and then , bango ! it starts all over again . Before I know what I 'm doing I 've got her up to the room . I do n't even remember what I say to them . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pat on the ass , and before I know what it 's all about it 's over . It 's like a dream . . . . Do you know what I mean ? " He has n't much use for the French girls . Ca n't stand them . " Either they want money or they want you to marry them . At bottom they 're all whores . I 'd rather wrestle with a virgin , " he says . " They give you a little illusion . They put up a fight at least . " Just the same , as we glance over the terrasse there is hardly a whore in sight whom he has n't fucked at some time or other . Standing at the bar he points them out to mc , one by one , goes over them anatomically , describes their good points and their bad . " They 're all frigid , " he says . And then begins to mold his hands , thinking of the nice , juicy virgins who are just dying for it . In the midst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ariii excitedly , he points to a whale of a woman who is just lowering herself into a seat . " There 's my Danish cunt , " he grunts . " See that ass ? Danish . How that woman loves it ! She just begs me for it . Come over here . . . look at her now , from the side ! Look at that ass , will you ? It 's enormous . I tell you , when she climbs over me I can hardly get my arms around it . It blots out the whole world . She makes me feel like a little bug crawling inside her . I do n't know why I fall for her  --  I suppose it 's that ass . Its so incongruous like . And the creases in it ! You ca n't forget an ass like that . It 's a fact . . . a solid fact . ' I he others , they may bore you , or they may give you a moment 's illusion , but this one  --  with her ass ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . it 's like going to bed with a monument on top of you . " The Danish cunt seems to have electrified him . He 's lost all his sluggishness now . His eyes are popping out of his head . And of course one thing reminds him of another . I le wants to get out of the fucking hotel because the noise bothers him . He wants to write a book too so as to have something to occupy his mind . But then the goddamned job stands in the way . " It takes it out of you , that fucking job ! I do n't want to write about Montparnasse . . . . I want to write my life , my thoughts . I want to get the dirt out of my belly . . . . Listen , get that one over there ! I had her a long time ago . She used to be downp105near Les Halles . A funny bitch . She lay on the edge of the bed and pulled her dress up . Ever try it that way ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She just lay back and played with her hat while I slugged away at her . And when I come she says sort of bored like  --  Are you through ? ' Like it did n't make any difference at all . Of course , it does n't make any difference , I know that goddamnwell . . . but the cold-blooded way she had . . . I sort of liked it . . . it was fascinating , you know ? When she goes to wipe herself she begins to sing . Going out of the hotel she was still singing . Did n't even say Au revoir ! Walks off swinging her hat and humming to herself like . That 's a whore for you ! A good lay though . I think I liked her better than my virgin . There 's something depraved about screwing a woman who does n't give a fuck about it . It heats your blood .... " And then , after a moment 's meditation  --  " Can you imagine what she 'd be like if she had any feelings ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you to come to the Club with me tomorrow afternoon . . . there 's a dance on . " " I ca n't tomorrow , Joe . I promised to help Carl out .... " " Listen , forget that prick ! I want you to do me a favor . It 's like this "  --  he commences to mold his hands again . " I 've got a cunt lined up . . . she promised to stay with me on my night off . But I 'm not positive about her yet . She 's got a mother , you see ... some shit of a painter , she chews my ear off every time I see her . I think the truth is , the mother 's jealous . I do n't think she 'd mind so much if I gave her a lay first . You know how it is . . . . Anyway , I thought maybe you would n't mind taking the mother ... she 's not so bad . . . if I had n't seen the daughter I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fresh like , you know what I mean ?

And besides , I want you to help me find a room . You know I 'm helpless . Find me a room in a quiet street , somewhere near here . I 've got to stay around here . . . I 've got credit here .

Jesus , I 've had the book out for three weeks now and I have n't looked at it . You sort of rot here . Would you believe it , I 've never been to the Louvre  --  nor the ComedieFrancaisc . Is it worth going to those joints ? Still , it sort of takes your mind off things , I suppose . What do you do with yourself all day ? Do n't you get bored ? What do you do for a lay ? Listen . . . come here ! Do n't run away yet ... I 'm lonely . Do you know something  --  if this keeps up another year I 'll go nuts . I 've got to get out of this fucking country . There 's nothing for me here . I know it 's lousy now , in America , but just the same . . . . You go queer over here . . . all these cheap shits sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of them is worth a stinking damn . They 're all failures  --  that 's why they come over here . Listen , Joe , do n't you ever get homesick ? You 're a funny guy . . . you seem to like it over here . What do you see in it ? . . . I wish you 'd tell me . Ip107wish to Christ I could stop thinking about myself . I 'm all twisted up inside . . . it 's like a knot in there . . . . Listen , I know I 'm boring the shit out of you , but I 've got to talk to someone . I ca n't talk to those guys upstairs . . . you know what those bastards are like . . . they all take a byline . And Carl , the little prick , he 's so goddamned selfish . I 'm an egotist , but I 'm not selfish . There 's a difference . I 'm a neurotic , I guess . I ca n't stop thinking about myself . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . I simply ca n't think about anything else , that 's all . If I could fall in love with a woman that might help some . But I ca n't find a woman who interests me . I 'm in a mess , you can see that ca n't you ? What do you advise me to do ? What would you do in my place ? Listen , I do n't want to hold you back any longer , but wake me up tomorrow  --  at onethirty  --  will you ? I 'll give you something extra if you 'll shine my shoes . And listen , if you 've got an extra shirt , a clean one , bring it along , will you ? Shit , I 'm grinding my balls off on that job , and it does n't even give me a clean shirt . They 've got us over here like a bunch of niggers . Ah , well , shit ! I 'm going to take a walk ... wash the dirt out of my belly . Do n't forget , tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on , this correspondence with the rich cunt , Irene . Recently I 've been reporting to Carl every day in order to bring the affair to a head , because as far as Irene is concerned this thing could go on indefinitely . In the last few days there 's been a perfect avalanche of letters exchanged ; the last letter we dispatched was almost forty pages long , and written in three languages . It was a potpourri , the last letter  --  tag ends of old novels , slices from the Sunday supplement , reconstructed versions of old letters to Llona and Tania , garbled transliterations of Rabelais and Petronius  --  in short , we exhausted ourselves . Finally Irene decides to come out of her shell . Finally a letter arrives giving a rendezvous at her hotel . Carl is pissing in his pants . It 's one thing to write letters to a woman you do n't know ; it 's another thing entirely to call on her and make love to her . At the last moment he 's quaking so that I almost fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out of the taxi in front of her hotel he 's trembling so much that I have to walk him around the block first . He 's already had two Pernods , but they have n't made the slightest impression on hint . ' The sight of the hotel itself is enough to crush him : it 's a pretentious place with one of those huge empty lobbies in which Englishwomen sit for hours with a blank look . I n order to make sure that he would n't run away I stood by while the porter telephoned to announcehint . Irene was there , and she was waiting for him . As he got into the lift he threw me a last despairing glance , one of those mute appeals which a dog makes when you put a noose around its neck . Going through the revolving door I thought of Van Norden .... I go back to the hotel and wait for a telephone call . He 's only got an hour 's time and he 's promised to let me know the results before going to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent her . I try to imagine the situation as it actually is , but it 's beyond me . Her letters are much better than ours  --  they 're sincere , that 's plain . By now they 've sized each other up . I wonder if he 's still pissing in his pants . The telephone rings . His voice sounds queer , squeaky , as though he were frightened and jubilant at the same time . He asks me to substitute for him at the office . " Tell the bastard anything ! Tell him I 'm dying .... " " Listen , Carl . . . can you tell me ... ? " " Hello ! Are you Henry Miller ? " It 's a woman 's voice.  |p109It  's Irene . She 's saying hello to me . Her voice sounds beautiful over the phone . . . beautiful . For a moment I 'm in a perfect panic . I do n't know what to say to her . I 'd like to say : " Listen , Irene , I think you are beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like to say one true thing to her , no matter how silly it would sound , because now that I hear her voice everything is changed . But before I can gather my wits Carl is on the phone again and he 's saying in that queer squeaky voice : " She likes you , Joe . I told her all about you .... " At the office I have to hold copy for Van Norden . ' When it comes time for the break he pulls me aside . He looks glum and ravaged . " So he 's dying , is he , the little prick ? Listen , what 's the lowdown on this ? " " I think he went to see his rich cunt , " I answer calmly . " What ! You mean he called on her ? " He seems beside himself . " Listen , where does she live ? ' What 's her name ? " I pretend ignorance . " Listen , " he says , " you 're a decent guy . Why the hell do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In order to appease him I promise finally that I 'll tell him everything as soon as I get the details from Carl . I can hardly wait myself until I see Carl . Around noon next day I knock at his door . He 's up alreadyand lathering his beard . Ca n't tell a thing from the expression on his face . Ca n't even tell whether he 's going to tell me the truth . The sun is streaming in through the open window , the birds are chirping , and yet somehow , why it is I do n't know , the room seems more barren and poverty-stricken than ever . The floor is slathered with lather , and on the rack there are the two dirty towels which are never changed . And somehow Carl is n't changed either , and that puzzles me more than anything.  | This morning the whole world ought to be changed , for bad or good , but changed , radically changed . And yet Carl is standing there lathering his face and not a single detail is altered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed , " he says . " You 're going to hear everything . . . but wait first .. . wait a little . " He commences to lather his face again , and then to hone his razor . I Ie even remarks about the water ... no hot water again . " Listen , Carl , I 'm on tenterhooks . You can torture me afterward , if you like , but tell me now , tell me one thing . . . was it good or bad ? " He turns away from the mirror with brush in hand and gives me a strange smile . " Wait ! I 'm going to tell you everything .... " " That means it was a failure . " " No , " he says , drawing out his words . " It was n't a failure , and it was n't a success either . . . . By the way , did you fix it up for me at the office ? What did you tell them ? " I sec it 's no use trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good and ready he 'll tell me . Not before . I lie back on the bed , silent as a clam . He goes on shaving . Suddenly , apropos of nothing at all , he begins to talk  --  disconnectedly at first , and then more and more clearly , emphatically , resolutely . It 's a struggle to get it out , but he seems determined to relate everything ; he acts as if he were getting something off his conscience . He even reminds me of the look he gave me as he was going up the elevator shaft . Ile dwells on that lingeringly , as though to imply that everything were contained in that last moment , as though , if he had the power to alter things , he would never have put foot outside the elevator . She was in her dressing sack when he called . There was a bucket of champagne on the dresser . The room wasP111rather dark and her voice was lovely . He gives me all the details about the room , the champagne , how the garcon opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressing sack rustled when she came forward to greet him  --  he tells me everything but what I want to hear . It was about eight when he called on her . At eightthirtyhe was nervous , thinking about the job . " It was about nine when I called you , was n't it ? " he says . " Yes , about that . " " I was nervous , see .... " " I know that . Go on . . . . " I do n't know whether to believe him or not , especially after those letters we concocted . I do n't even know whether I 've heard him accurately , because what he 's telling me sounds utterly fantastic . And yet it sounds true too , knowing the sort of guy he is . And then I remember his voice over the telephone , that strange mixture of fright and jubilation . But why is n't he more jubilantnow ? He keeps smiling all the time , smiling like a rosy little bedbug that has had its fill . " It was nine o'clock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you up , was n't it ? " I nod my head wearily . Yes , it was nine o'clock . He is certain now that it was nine o'clock because he remembers having taken out his watch . Anyway , when he looked at his watch again it was ten o'clock . At ten o'clock she was lying on the divan with her boobies in her hands . That 's the way he gives it to me  --  in driblets . At eleven o'clock it was all settled ; they were going to run away , to Borneo . Fuck the husband ! She never loved him anyway . She would never have written the first letter if the husband was n't old and passionless . " And then she says to me : But listen , dear , how do you know you wo n't get tired of me ? ' "  |p112At  this I burst out laughing . This sounds preposterous to me , I ca n't help it . " And you said ? " " What did you expect me to say ? I said : How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then he describes to me what happened after that , how he bent down and kissed her breasts , and how , after he had kissed them fervidly , he stuffed them back into her corsage , or whatever it is they call these things . And after that another coupe of champagne . Around midnight the garcon arrives with beer and sandwiches  --  caviar sandwiches . And all the while , so he says , he has been dying to take a leak . He had one hard on , but it faded out . All the while his bladder is fit to burst , but he imagines , the cute little prick that he is , that the situation calls for delicacy . At one-thirty she 's for hiring a carriage and driving through the Bois . He has only one thought in his head  --  how to take a leak ? " I love you . . . I adore you , " he says . " I 'll go anywhere you say  --  Istanbul , Singapore , Honolulu . Only I must go now . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells me all this in his dirty little room , with the sun pouring in and the birds chirping away like mad . I do n't yet know whether she was beautiful or not . He does n't know himself , the imbecile . He rather thinks she was n't . The room was dark and then there was the champagne and his nerves all frazzled . " But you ought to know something about her  --  if this is n't all a goddamned lie ! " " Wait a minute , " he says . " Wait . . . let me think ! No , she was n't beautiful . I 'm sure of that now . She had a streak of gray hair over her forehead ... I remember that . But that would n't be so had  --  I had almost forgotten it you see . No , it was her arms  --  they were thin . . . theyp113were thin and brittle . " He begins to pace back and forth .  --  Suddenly he stops dead . " If she were only ten years younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years younger I might overlook the streak of gray hair . . . and even the brittle arms . But she 's too old . You see , with a cunt like that every year counts now . She wo n't be just one year older next year  --  she 'll be ten years older . Another year hence and she 'll be twenty years older . And I 'll be getting younger looking all the time  --  at least for another five years . . . . " " But how did it end ? " I interrupt . " That 's just it . . . it did n't end . I promised to see her Tuesday around five o'clock . That 's bad , you know ! There were lines in her face which will look much worse in daylight . I suppose she wants me to fuck her Tuesday . Fucking in the daytime  --  you do n't do it with a cunt like that . Especially in a hotel like that . I 'd rather do it on my night off ... but Tuesday 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I promised her a letter in the meantime . How am I going to write her a letter now ? I have n't anything to say .... Shit ! If only she were ten years younger . Do you think I should go with her . . . to Borneo or wherever it is she wants to take me ? What would I do with a rich cunt like that on my hands ? I do n't know how to shoot . I am afraid of guns and all that sort of thing . Besides , she 'll be wanting me to fuck her night and day . . . nothing but hunting and fucking all the time . . . I ca n't do it ! " " Maybe it wo n't be so bad as you think . She 'll buy you ties and all sorts of things .... " " Maybe you 'll come along with us , eh ? I told her allabout you .... " " Did you tell her I was poor ? Did you tell her I needed things ? " " I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p114if  she were just a few years younger . She said she was turning forty . That means fifty or sixty . It 's like fucking your own mother . . . you ca n't do it . . . it 's impossible . " " But she must have had some attractiveness . . . you were kissing her breasts , you said . " " Kissing her breasts  --  what 's that ? Besides it was dark , I 'm telling you . " Putting on his pants a button falls off . " Look at that , will you . It 's falling apart , the goddamned suit . I 've worn it for seven years now .... I never paid for it either . It was a good suit once , but it stinks now . And that cunt would buy me suits too , all I wanted most likely . But that 's what I do n't like , having a woman shell out for me . I never did that in my life . That 's your idea . I 'd rather live alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? What 's wrong with it ? It 's a damned sight better than her room , is n't it ? I do n't like her fine hotel . I 'm against hotels like that . I told her so . She said she did n't care where she lived . . . said she 'd come and live with me if I wanted her to . Can you picture her moving in here with her big trunks and her hatboxes and all that crap she drags around with her ? She has too many things  --  too many dresses and bottles and all that . It 's like a clinic , her room . If she gets a little scratch on her finger it 's serious . And then she has to be massaged and her hair has to be waved and she must n't eat this and she must n't eat that . Listen , Joe , she 'd be all right if she were just a little younger . You can forgive a young cunt anything . A young cunt does n't have to have any brains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But an old cunt , even if she 's brilliant , even if she 's the most charming woman in the world , nothing makes any difference . A young cunt is an investment ; an old cunt is a dead loss . All they can do for you is buy you things . But that does n't put meat on their arms or juice between the legs . SheP115is n't bad , Irene . In fact , I think you 'd like her . With you it 's different . You do n't have to fuck her . You can afford to like her . Maybe you would n't like all those dresses and the bottles and what not , but you could be tolerant . She would n't bore you , that I can tell you . She 's even interesting , I might say . But she 's withered . Her breasts are all right yet  --  but her arms ! I told her I 'd bring you around some day . I talked a lot about you . . . . I did n't know what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially when she 's dressed . I do n't know .... " " Listen , she 's rich , you say ? I 'll like her ! I do n't care how old she is , so long as she 's not a hag .... " " She 's not a hag ! What are you talking about ? She 's charming , I tell you . She talks well . She looks well too .. . only her arms .... " " All right , if that 's how it is , I 'll fuck her  --  if you do n't want to . Tell her that . Be subtle about it , though . With a woman like that you 've got to do things slowly . You bring me around and let things work out for themselves . Praise the shit out of me . Act jealous like .... Shit , maybe we 'll fuck her together . . . and we 'll go places and we 'll eat together . . . and we 'll drive and hunt and wear nice things . If she wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know how to shoot either , but that does n't matter . She does n't care about that either . She just wants to be fucked that 's all . You 're talking about her arms all the time . You do n't have to look at her arms all the time , do you ? Look at this bedspread ! Look at the mirror ! Do you call this living ? Do you want to go on being delicate and live like a louse all your life ? You ca n't even pay your hotel bill . . . and you 've got a job too . This is no way to live . I do n't care if she 's seventy years old  --  it 's better than this . . . . " " Listen , Joe , you fuck her for me . . . then every- thing 'll be fine . Maybe I 'll fuck her once in a while too .. . on my night off . It 's four days now since I 've had a good shit . There 's something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You 've got the piles , that 's what . " " My hair 's falling out too . . . and I ought to see the dentist . I feel as though I were falling apart . I told her what a good guy you are . . . . You 'll do things for me , eh ? You 're not too delicate , ch ? If we go to Borneo I wo n't have hemorrhoids any more . Maybe I 'll develop something else . . . something worse . . . fever perhaps . . . or cholera . Shit , it 's better to die of a good disease like that than to piss your life away on a newspaper with grapes up your ass and buttons falling off your pants . I 'd like to be rich , even if it were only for a week , and then go to a hospital with a good disease , a fatal one , and have flowers in the room and nurses dancing around and telegrams coming . I hey take good care of you if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they comb your hair for you . Shit , I know all that . Maybe I 'd be lucky and not die at all . Maybe I 'd be a cripple all my life . . . maybe I 'd be paralyzed and have to sit in a wheelchair . But then I 'd be taken care of just the same . . . even if I had no more money . If you 're an invalid  --  a real one  --  they do n't let you starve . And you get a clean bed to lie in . . . and they change the towels every day . This way nobody gives a fuck about you , especially if you have a job . They think a man should be happy if he 's got a job . What would you rather do  --  be a cripple all your life , or have a job . . . or marry a rich cunt ? You 'd rather marry a rich cunt , I can see that . You only think about food . But supposing you married her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that happens sometimes  --  what would you do then ? You 'd be at her mercy . You 'd have to eat out of her hand , like a little poodle dog . You 'd like that , would you ? P117Or maybe you do n't think of those things ? 1 think of everything . I think of the suits I 'd pick out and the places I 'd like to go to , but I also think of the other thing . That 's the important thing . What good are the fancy tics and the fine suits if you ca n't get a hard on any more ? You could n't even betray her  --  because she 'd be on your heels all the time . No , the best thing would be to marry her and then get a disease right away . Only not syphilis . Cholera , let 's say , or yellow fever . So that if a miracle did happen and your life was spared you 'd be a cripple for the rest of your days . Then you would n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to worry about the rent either . She 'd probably buy you a fine wheelchair with rubber tires and all sorts of levers and what not . You might even be able to use your hands  --  I mean enough to be able to write . Or you could have a secretary , for that matter . That 's it  --  that 's the best solution for a writer . What does a guy want with his arms and legs ? He does n't need arms and legs to write with . He needs security .. . peace . . . protection . All those heroes who parade in wheelchairs  --  it 's too bad they 're not writers . If you could only be sure , when you go to war , that you 'd have only your legs blown off . . . if you could be sure of that I 'd say let 's have a war tomorrow . I would n't give a fuck about the medals  --  they could keep the medals . All I 'd want is a good wheelchair and three meals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read , those pricks . " The following day , at one-thirty , I call on Van Norden . It 's his day off , or rather his night off . He has left word with Carl that I am to help him move today . I find him in a state of unusual depression . He has n't slept a wink all night , he tells me . There 's something on his mind , something that 's eating him up . It is n't long before I discover what it is ; he 's been waiting impatiently for me to arrive in order to spill it . " That guy , " he begins , meaning Carl , " that guy 's an artist . He described every detail minutely . He told it to me with such accuracy that I know it 's all a goddamned lie ... but I ca n't dismiss it from my mind . You know how my mind works ! " He interrupts himself to inquire if Carl has told me the whole story . There is n't the least suspicion in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him another . He seems to think that the story was invented expressly to torture him . I le does n't seem to mind so much that it 's a fabrication . It 's the " images " as he says , which Carl left in his mind , that get him . The images are real , even if the whole story is false . And besides , the fact that there actuallyis a rich cunt on the scene and that Carl actually paid her a visit , that 's undeniable . What actually happenedis secondary ; he takes it for granted that Carl put the hoots to her . But what drives him desperate is the thought that what Carl has described to him might have been possible . " It 's just like that guy , " he says , " to tell me he put it to her six or seven times . I know that 's a lot of shit and I do n't mind that so much , but when he tells me that she hired a carriage and drove him out to the Bois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blanket , that 's too much . I suppose he told you about the chauffeur waiting respectfully . . . and listen , did he tell you how the engine purred all the time ? Jesus , he built that up wonderfully . It 's just like him to think of a detail like that . . . it 's one of those little details which makes a thing psychologically real . . . you ca n't get it out of your head afterward . And he tells it to me so smoothly , so naturally . . . . I wonder , did he think it up in advance or did it just pop out of hisp119head like that , spontaneously ? He 's such a cute little liar you ca n't walk away from him . . . it 's like he 's writing you a letter , one of those flowerpots that he makes overnight . I do n't understand how a guy can write such letters . . . I do n't get the mentality behind it . . . it 's a form of rnasturbation. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have an opportunity to venture an opinion , or even to laugh in his face , Van Norden goes on with his monologue . " Listen , I suppose he told you everything . . . did he tell you how he stood on the balcony in the moonlight and kissed her ? That sounds banal when you repeat it , but the way that guy describes it . . . I can just see the little prick standing there with the woman in his arms and already he 's writing another letter to her , another flowerpot about the roof tops and all that crap he steals from his French authors . That guy never says a thing that 's original , I found that out . You have to get a clue like ... find out whom he 's been reading lately . . . and it 's hard to do that because he 's so damned secretive . Listen , if I did n't know that you went there with him , I would n't believe that the woman existed . A guy like that could write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . he 's so damned tiny , so frail , so romantic looking , that women fall for him now and then . . . they sort of adopt him . . . they feel sorry for him , I guess . And some cunts like to receive flowerpots . . . it makes them feel important . . . . But this woman 's an intelligent woman , so he says . You ought to know . . . you 've seen her letters . What do you suppose a woman like that saw in him ? I can understand her fallingfor the letters . . . but how do you suppose she felt when she saw him ? " But listen , all that 's beside the point . What I 'm getting at is the way he tells it to me . You know how he em- broiders things . . . well , after that scene on the balcony  --  he gives me that like an hors d'oeuvre , you know  --  after that , so he says , they went inside and he unbuttoned her pajamas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shitting me about that ? " " No , no ! You 're giving it to me exactly as he told me . Go ahead . . . " " After that "  --  here Van Norden has to smile himself  --  " afterthat , mind you , he tells me how she sat in the chair with her legs up . . . not a stitch on . . . and he 's sitting on the floor looking up at her , telling her how beautifulshe looks . . . did he tell you that she looked like a Matisse ? . . . Wait a minute . . . I 'd like to remember exactly what he said . He had some cute little phrase there about an odalisque . . . what the hell 's an odalisque anyway ? I le said it in French , that 's why it 's hard to remember the fucking thing . . . but it sounded good . It sounded just like the sort of thing he might say . And she probably thought it was original with him . . . I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen , all this is nothing .. . I make allowance for his imagination . It 's what happened after that that drives me crazy . All night long I 've been tossing about , playing with these images he left in my mind . I ca n't get it out of my head . It sounds so real to me that if it did n't happen I could strangle the bastard . A guy has no right to invent things like that . Or else he 's diseased .... " What I 'm getting at is that moment when , he says , he got down on his knees and with those two skinny fingers of his he spread her cunt open . You remember that ? He says she was sitting there with her legs dangling over the arms of the chair and suddenly , he says , he got an inspiration . This was after he had given her a couple of lays already . . . after he had made that little spiel aboutp121Matisse . He gets down on his knees  --  get this !  --  and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , mind you ... he opens the little petals . . . squish-squish . . . just like that . A sticky little sound . . . almost inaudible . Squish-squish ! Jesus , I 've been hearing it all night long ! And then he says  --  as if that were n't enough for me  --  then he tells me he buried his head in her muff . And when he did that , so help me Christ , if she did n't swing her legs around his neck and lock him there . That finished me ! Imagine it ! Imagine a fine , sensitive woman like that swinging her legs around his neck ! There 's something poisonous about it . It 's so fantastic that it sounds convincing . If he had only told me about the champagne and the ride in the Bois and even that scene on the balcony I could have dismissedit . But this thing is so incredible that it does n't sound like a lie any more . I ca n't believe that he ever read anything like that anywhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea into his head unless there was some truth in it . With a little prick like that , you know , anythingcan happen . He may not have fucked her at all , but she may have let him diddle her . . . you never know with these rich cunts what they might expect you to do . . . . " When he finally pulls himself out of bed and starts to shave the afternoon is already well advanced . I 've finally succeeded in switching his mind to other things , to the moving principally . The maid comes in to see if he 's ready  --  he 's supposed to have vacated the room by noon . He 's just in the act of slipping into his trousers . I 'm a little surprised that he does n't excuse himself , or turn away . Seeing him standing there nonchalantly buttoning his fly as he gives her orders I begin to titter . " Do n't mind her , " he says , throwing her a look of supreme contempt , " she 's just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you like . She wo n't say anything . " And then addressing her , in Eng- lish , he says . " Come here , you bitch , put your hand on this ! " At this I ca n't restrain myself any longer . I burst out laughing , a fit of hysterical laughter which infects the maid also , though she does n't know what it 's all about . The maid commences to take down the pictures and the photographs , mostly of himself , which line the walls . " You , " he says , jerking his thumb , " come here ! Here 's something to remember me by "  --  ripping a photograph off the wall  --  " when I go you can wipe your ass with it . See , " he says , turning to me , " she 's a dumb bitch . She would n't look any more intelligent if I said it in French . " The maid stands there with her mouth open ; she is evidentlyconvinced that he is cracked . " Hey ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hearing . " Hey , you ! Yes , you ! Like this ... ! " and he takes the photograph , his own photograph , and wipes his ass with it . " Comore ca ! Savvy ? You 've got to draw pictures for her , " he says , thrusting his lower lip forward in absolute disgust . I Ic watches her helplessly as she throws his things into the big valises . " Here , put these in too , " he says , handing her a toothbrush and the douche bag . Half of his belongingsare lying on the floor . The valises are crammed full and there is nowhere to put the paintings and the books and the bottles that are half empty . " Sit down a minute , " he says . " We 've got plenty of time . We 've got to think this thing out . If you had n't come around I 'd never have gotten out of here . You see how helpless I am . Do n't let me forget to take the bulbs out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me too . They expect you to live like pigs , these bastards . " The maid has gone downstairs to get some twine . . . . " Wait till you see . . . she 'll charge me for the twine even if it 's only three sous . They would n't sew a button on your pants here without chargingfor it . The lousy , dirty scroungers ! " He takes a bottlep 12 3of Calvados from the mantelpiece and nods to me to grab the other . " No use carrying these to the new place . Let 's finish them off now . But do n't give her a drink ! That bastard , I would n't leave her a piece of toilet paper . I 'd like to ruin the joint before I go . Listen . . . piss on the floor , if you like . I wish I could take a crap in the bureau drawer . " He feels so utterly disgusted with himself and everything else that he does n't know what to do by way of venting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle in his hand and pulling back the covers he sprinkles Calvados over the mattress . Not content with that he digs his heel into the mattress . Unfortunately there 's no mud on his heels . Finally he takes the sheet and cleans his shoes with it . " That 'll give them something to do , " he mutters vengefully . Then , taking a good swig , he throws his head back and gargles his throat , and after he 's gargled it good and proper he spits it out on the mirror . " There , you cheap bastards ! Wipe that off when I go ! " He walks back and forth mumbling to himself . Seeing his torn socks lying on the floor he picks them up and tears them to bits . The paintings enrage him too . He picks one up  --  a portrait of himself done by some Lesbian he knew and he puts his foot through it . " That bitch ! You know what she had the nerve to ask me ? She asked me to turn over my cunts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave me a sou for writing her up . She thought I honestly admired her work . I would n't have gotten that painting out of her if I had n't promised to fix her up with that cunt from Minnesota . She was nuts about her . . . used to follow us around like a dog in heat . . . we could n't get rid of the bitch ! She bothered the life out of me . I got so that I was almost afraid to bring a cunt up here for fear that she 'd bust in on me . I used to creep up here like a burglar and lock the door behind me as soon as I got inside . . . . SheP124and that Georgia cunt  --  they drive me nuts . The one is always in heat and the other is always hungry . I hate fuckinga woman who 's hungry . It 's like you push a feed inside her and then you push it out again . . . . Jesus , that reminds me of something . . . where did I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever have those things ? It 's worse than having a dose . And I do n't know where I got them from either . I 've had so many women up here in the last week or so I 've lost track of them . Funny too , because they all smelled so fresh . But you know how it is .... The maid has piled his things up on the sidewalk . The patron looks on with a surly air . When everything has been loaded into the taxi there is only room for one of us inside . As soon as we commence to roll Van Norden gets our a newspaper and starts bundling up his pots and pans ; in the new place all cooking is strictly forbidden . By the time we reach our destination all his luggage has come undone ; it would n't be quite so embarrassing if the madamhad not stuck her head out of the doorway just as we rolled up . " My God ! " she exclaims , " what in the devil is all this ? What does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can think of nothing more to say than " C'est nnoi . . . c'est moi , madame ! " And turning to me hemumbles savagely : " That cluck ! Did you notice her face ? She 's going to make it hard for me . " The hotel lies back of a dingy passage and forms a rectanglevery much on the order of a modern penitentiary . The bureau is large and gloomy , despite the brilliant reflectionsfrom the tile walls . There are bird cages hanging in the windows and little enamel signs everywhere beggingthe guests in an obsolete language not to do this and not to forget that . It is almost immaculately clean but absolutely poverty-stricken , threadbare , woebe-p 125gone . The upholstered chairs are held together with wired thongs ; they remind one unpleasantly of the electric chair . The room he is going to occupy is on the fifth floor . As we climb the stairs Van Nordcn informsme that Maupassant once lived here . And in the same breath remarks that there is a peculiar odor in the hall . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment gazing at the tenants across the court . It is getting toward dinner time and people are straggling back to their rooms with that weary , dejected air which comes from earning a living honestly . Most of the windowsare wide open : the dingy rooms have the appearance of so many yawning mouths . The occupants of the rooms are yawning too , or else scratching themselves . They move about listlessly and apparently without much purpose ; they might just as well be lunatics . As we turn down the corridor toward room 57 , a door suddenly opens in front of us and an old hag with matted hair and the eyes of a maniac peers out . She startles us so that we stand transfixed . For a full minute the three of us stand there powerless to move or even to make an intelligentgesture . Back of the old hag I can see a kitchen table and on it lies a baby all undressed , a puny little brat no bigger than a plucked chicken . Finally the old one picks up a slop pail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand aside to let her pass and as the door closes behind her the baby lets out a piercing scream . It is room 56 , and between 56 and 57 is the toilet where the old hag is emptying her slops . Ever since we have mounted the stairs Van Norden has kept silence . But his looks are eloquent . When he opens the door of 57 I have for a fleeting moment the sensation of going mad . A huge mirror covered with green gauze and tipped at an angle of 45 degrees hangs directly op- posite the entrance over a baby carriage which is filled with books . Van Norden does n't even crack a smile ; insteadhe walks nonchalantly over to the baby carriage and picking up a book begins to skim it through , much as a man would enter the public library and go unthinkingly to the rack nearest to hand . And perhaps this would not seem so ludicrous to me if I had not espied at the same time a pair of handle bars resting in the corner . They look so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozing there for years , that suddenly it seems to me as if we had been standing in this room , in exactly this position , for an incalculably long time , that it was a pose we had struck in a dream from which we never emerged , a dream which the least gesture , the wink of an eye even , will shatter . But more remarkable still is the remembrancethat suddenly floats up of an actual dream which occurred only the other night , a dream in which I saw Van Norden in just such a corner as is occupied now by the handle bars , only instead of the handle bars there was a woman crouching with her legs drawn up . I see him standing over the woman with that alert , eager look in his cyc which comes when he wants something badly . The street in which this is going on is blurred  --  only the angle made by the two walls is clear , and the cowering figure of the woman . I can see him going at her in that quick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on about him , determined only to have his way . And a look in his eyes as though to say  --  " you can kill me afterwards , but just let me get it in . . . I 've got to get it in ! " And there he is , bent over her , their heads knocking against the wall , he has such a tremendous erection that it 's simply impossible to get it in her . Suddenly , with that disgusted air which he knows so well how to summon , he picks himself up and adjusts his clothes . He is about to walk away when sud-P127denly he notices that his penis is lying on the sidewalk . It is about the size of a sawed-off broomstick . He picks it up nonchalantly and slings it under his arm . As he walks off I notice two huge bulbs , like tulip bulbs , dangling from the end of the broomstick , and I can hear him muttering to himself " flowerpots . . . flowerpots . " The garcon arrives panting and sweating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marches in and , walking straight up to Van Norden , she takes the book out of his hand , thrusts it in the baby carriage , and , without saying a word , wheels the baby carriage into the hallway . " This is a bughouse , " says Van Norden , smiling distressedly . It is such a faint , indescribable smile that for a moment the dream feeling comes back and it seems to me that we are standing at the end of a long corridor at the end of which is a corrugated mirror . And down this corridor , swinging his distress like a dingy lantern , Van Norden staggers , staggers in and out as here and there a door opens and a hand yanks him in or a hoof pushes him out . And the further off he wanders the more lugubrious is his distress ; he wears it like a lantern which the cyclists hold between their teeth on a night when the pavement is wet and slippery . In and out of the dingy rooms he wanders , and when he sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is only a toothbrush inside . In every room there is a mirror before which he stands attentivelyand chews his rage , and from the constant chewing , from the grumbling and mumbling and the muttering and cursing his jaws have gotten unhinged and they sag badly and , when he rubs his beard , pieces of his jaw crumble away and he 's so disgusted with himself that he stamps on his own jaw , grinds it to bits with his big heels . P128Meanwhile the luggage is being hauled in . And things begin to look crazier even than before  --  particularly when he attaches his exerciser to the bedstead and begins his Sandow exercises . " I like this place , " he says , smiling at the garcon . He takes his coat and vest off . The garcon is watching him with a puzzled air ; he has a valise in one hand and the douche bag in the other . I 'm standing apart in the antechamber holding the mirror with the green gauze . Not a single object seems to possess a practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vestibule to a barn . It is exactly the same sort of sensation which I get when I enter the Comedie-Francaise or the PalaisRoyalTheatre ; it is a world of bric-a-brac , of trap doors , of arms and busts and waxed floors , of candelabras and men in armor , of statues without eyes and love letters lying in glass cases . Something is going on , but it makes no sense ; it 's like finishing the half-empty bottle of Calvadosbecause there 's no room in the valise . Climbing up the stairs , as I said a moment ago , he had men ' ioned the fact that Maupassant used to live here . The coincidence seems to have made an impression upon him . I lc would like to believe that it was in this very room that Maupassant gave birth to some of those gruesome tales on which his reputation rests . " They lived like pigs , those poor bastards , " he says . We are sitting at the round table in a pair of comfortable old armchairs that have been trussed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so close indeed that we can put our feet on it . The armoire stands in a corner behind us , also convenientlywithin reach . Van Norden has emptied his dirty wash on the table ; we sit there with our feet buried in his dirty socks and shirts and smoke contentedly . The sordidnessof the place seems to have worked a spell on him : he is content here . When I get up to switch on the light hep129suggests that we play a game of cards before going out to eat . And so we sit there by the window , with the dirty wash strewn over the floor and the Sandow exerciser hanging from the chandelier , and we play a few rounds of two-handed pinochle . Van Norden has put away his pipe and packed a wad of snuff on the underside of his lower lip . Now and then he spits out of the window , big healthy gobs of brown juice which resound with a smack on the pavement below . He seems content now . " In America , " he says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this . Even when I was on the burn I slept in better rooms than this . But here it seems natural  --  it 's like the books you read . If I ever go back there I 'll forget all about this life , just like you forget a bad dream . I 'll probablytake up the old life again just where I left off . . . if I ever get back . Sometimes I lie in bed dreaming about the past and it 's so vivid to me that I have to shake myself in order to realize where I am . Especially when I have a woman beside me ; a woman can set me off better than anything . That 's all I want of them  --  to forget myself . Sometimes I get so lost in my reveries that I ca n't remember the name of the cunt or where I picked her up . That 's funny , eh ? It 's good to have a fresh warm body beside you when you wake up in the morning . It gives you a clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they start pulling that mushy crap about love et cetera . Why do all these cunts talk about love so much , can you tell me that ? A good lay is n't enough for them apparently . . . theywant your soul too .... " Now this word soul , which pops up frequently in Van Norden 's soliloquies , used to have a droll effect upon me at first . Whenever I heard the word soul from his lips I would get hysterical ; somehow it seemed like a false coin , more particularly because it was usually accompanied by a gob of brown juice which left a trickle down the corner of his mouth . And as I never hesitated to laugh in his face it happened invariably that when this little word bobbed up Van Norden would pause just long enough for me to burst into a cackle and then , as if nothing had happened , he would resume his monologue , repeating the word more and more frequently and each time with a more caressing emphasis . It was the soul of him that women were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has explained it over and over again , but he comes back to it afresh each time like a paranoiac to his obsession . In a sense Van Norden is mad , of that I 'm convinced . His one fear is to he left alone , and this fear is so deep and so persistent that even when he is on top of a woman , even when he has welded himself to her , he can not escapethe prison which he has created for himself . " I try all sorts of things , " he explains to me . " I even count sometimes , or I begin to think of a problem in philosophy , but it does n't work . It 's like I 'm two people , and one of them is watching me all the time . I get so goddamned mad at myself that I could kill myself . . . and in a way , that 's what I do every time I have an orgasm . For one second like I obliterate myself . There 's not even one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even the cunt . It 's like receiving communion . Honest , I mean that . Fora few seconds afterward I have a fine spiritual glow . . . and maybe it would continue that way indefinitely  --  how can you tell ?  --  if it were n't for the fact that there 's a woman beside you and then the douche bag and the water running .. . all those little details that make you desperately selfconscious , desperately lonely . And for that one moment of freedom you have to listen to all that love crap . . . it drives me nuts sometimes . . . I want to kick them out immediately . . . I do now and then . But that does n't keepP131them away . They like it , in fact . The less you notice them the more they chase after you . There 's something perverseabout women . . . they 're all masochists at heart . " " But what is it you want of a woman , then ? " I demand . He begins to mold his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When eventually he succeedsin stammering out a few broken phrases it 's with the conviction that behind his words lies an overwhelmingfutility . " I want to be able to surrender myself to a woman , " he blurts out . " I want her to take me out of myself . But to do that , she 's got to be better than I am ; she 's got to have a mind , not just a cunt . She 's got to make me believe that I need her , that I ca n't live without her . Find me a cunt like that , will you ? If you could do that I 'd give you my job . I would n't care then what happened to me : I would n't need a job or friends or books or anything . If she could only make me believe that there was something more important on earth than myself . Jesus , I hate myself ! But I hate these bastardly cunts even more  --  because they 're none of them any good . " You think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows how little you know about me . I know I 'm a great guy ... . I would n't have these problems if there were n't something to me . But what eats me up is that I ca n't express myself . People think I 'm a cunt-chaser . That 's how shallow they are , these high brows who sit on the terrasse all day chewing the psychologic cud . . . . That 's not so bad , ehpsychologiccud ? Write it down for me . I 'll use it in my column next week . . . . By the way , did you ever read Stekel ? Is he any good ? It looks like nothing but case histories to me . I wish to Christ I could get up enough nerve to visit an analyst . . . a good one , I mean . I do n't want to see these little shysters with goatees and frock coats , like your friend Boris . How do you manage top132tolerate those guys ? Do n't they bore you stiff ? You talk to anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe you 're right . I wish I were n't so damned critical . But these dirty little Jews who hang around the Dome , Jesus , they give me the creeps . They sound just like textbooks . If I could talk to you every day maybe I could get things off my chest . You 're a good listener . I know you do n't give a damn about me , but you 're patient . And you do n't have any theories to exploit . I suppose you put it all down afterward in that notebook of yours . Listen , I do n't mind what you say about me , but do n't make me out to be a cunt-chaser  --  it 's too simple . Some day I 'll write a book about myself , about my thoughts . I do n't mean just a piece of introspective analysis . . . I mean that I 'll lay myself down on the operating table and I 'll expose my whole guts . . . every goddamned thing . Has anybody ever done that before ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sound naif ? " l'ni smiling because whenever we touch on the subject of this book which he is going to write some day things assume an incongruous aspect . He has only to say " my hook " and immediately the world shrinks to the private dimensions of Van Norden and Co . The book must be absolutely original , absolutely perfect . That is why , among other things , it is impossible for him to get started on it . As soon as he gets an idea he begins to question it . He remembers that Dostoevski used it , or Hamsun , or somebodyelse . " I 'm not saying that I want to be better than them , but I want to be different , " he explains . And so , instead of tackling his book , he reads one author after anotherin order to make absolutely certain that he is not going to tread on their private property . And the more he reads the more disdainful he becomes . None of them are satisfying ; none of them arrive at that degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgetting completely that he has not written as much as a chapter he talks about them condescendingly , quite as though there existed a shelf of books bearing his name , books which everyone is familiar with and the titles of which it is therefore superfluous to mention . Though he has never overtly lied about this fact , nevertheless it is obvious that the people whom he buttonholes in order to air his private philosophy , his criticism , and his grievances , take it for granted that behind his loose remarks there stands a solid body of work . Especially the young and foolish virgins whom he lures to his room on the pretext of reading to them his poems , or on the still better pretext of asking their advice . Without the least feeling of guilt or selfconsciousnesshe will hand them a piece of soiled paper on which he has scribbled a few lines  --  the basis of a new poem , as he puts it  --  and with absolute seriousness demandof them an honest expression of opinion . As they usually have nothing to give by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the utter senselessness of the lines , Van Norden seizes the occasion to expound to them his view of art , a view , needless to say , which is spontaneouslycreated to suit the event . So expert has he becomein this role that the transition from Ezra Pound 's cantos to the bed is made as simply and naturally as a modulationfrom one key to another ; in fact , if it were not made there would be a discord , which is what happens now and then when he makes a mistake as regards those nitwits whom he refers to as " push-overs . " Naturally , constituted as he is , it is with reluctance that he refers to these fatal errors of judgment . But when he does bring himself to confess to an error of this kind it is with absolutefrankness ; in fact , he seems to derive a perverse pleasure in dwelling upon his inaptitude . There is one woman ,  |p134for  example , whom he has been trying to make for almost ten years now  --  first in America , and finally here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex with whom he has a cordial , friendly relationship . They seem not only to like each other , but to understand each other . At first it seemed to me that if he could really make this creature his problem might be solved . All the elements for a successful union were there  --  except the fundamental one . Bessie was almost as unusual in her way as himself . She had as littleconcern about giving herself to a man as she has about the dessert which follows the meal . Usually she singled out the object of her choice and made the proposition herself . She was not bad-looking , nor could one say that she was good-looking either . She had a fine body , that was the chief thing  --  and she liked it , as they say . " I'Itcy were so chummy , these two , that sometimes , in order to gratify her curiosity ( and also in the vain hope of inspiring her by his prowess ) , Van Norden would arrangeto hide her in his closet during one of his seances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiding place and they would discuss the matter casually , that is to say , with an almost total indifference to everything except " technique . " Technique was one of her favorite terms , at least in those discussions which I was privileged to enjoy . " What 's wrong with my technique ? " he would say . And Bessie would answer : " You 're too crude . If you ever expect to make me you 've got to become more subtle . " There was such a perfect understanding between them , as I say , that often when I called for Van Norden at onethirty , I would find Bessie sitting on the bed , the covers thrown back and Van Norden inviting her to stroke his penis . . . " just a few silken strokes , " he would say , " so as I 'll have the courage to get up . " Or else he would urgeP135her to blow on it , or failing that , he would grab hold of himself and shake it like a dinner bell , the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never make this bitch , " he would say . " She has no respect for me . That 's what I get for taking her into my confidence . " And then abruptly he might add : " What do you make of that blonde I showed you yesterday ? " Talking to Bessie , of course . And Bessiewould jeer at him , telling him he had no taste . " Aw , do n't give me that line , " he would say . And then playfully , perhaps for the thousandth time , because by now it had become a standing joke between them  --  " Listen , Bessie , what about a quick lay ? Just one little lay . . . no . " And when this had passed off in the usual manner he would add , in the same tone : " Well , what about him ? Why do n't you give him a lay ? " The whole point about Bessie was that she could n't , or just would n't , regard herself as a lay . She talked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was passionate about things , even a little thing like a lay . She had to put her soul into it . " I get passionate too sometimes , " Van Norden would say . " Oh , you , " says Bessie . " You 're just a worn-out satyr . You do n't know the meaning of passion . When you get an erection you think you 're passionate . " " All right , maybe it 's not passion . . . but you ca n't get passionate without having an erection , that 's true is n't it ? " All this about Bessie , and the other women whom he drags to his room day in and out , occupies my thoughts as we walk to the restaurant . I have adjusted myself so well to his monologues that without interrupting my own reveries I make whatever comment is required automaticalIv , the moment I hear his voice die out . It is a duct , and like most duets moreover in that one listens attentively only for the signal which announces the advent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night off , and as I have promised to keep him company , I have already dulled myself to his queries . I know that before the evening is over I shall be thoroughly exhausted ; if I am lucky , that is , if I can worm a few francs out of hint on some pretext or other , I will duck him the moment he goes to the toilet . But he knows my propensity for slipping away , and , instead of being insulted , he simply provides against the possibility by guarding his sous . If I ask him for money to buy cigarettes he insists on going with me to purchase them . He will not be left alone , not for a second . Even when he has succeeded in grabbing off a woman , even then he is terrified to be left alone with her . If it were possible he would have me sit in the room while he puts on the performance . It would be like asking me to wait while he took a shave . On his night off Van Norden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket , a circumstance which does not prevent him from making a touch whenever he encounters a prospect . " Hello , " he says , " give me twenty francs . . . I need it . " He has a way of looking panic-stricken at the same time . And if he meets with a rebuff he becomes insulting . " Well , you can buy a drink at least . " And when he gets his drink he says more graciously  --  " Listengive me five francs then . . . give me two francs .... " We go from bar to bar looking for a little excitement and always accumulating a few more francs . At the Coupole we stumble into a drunk from the newspaper . One of the upstairs guys . There 's just been an accident at the office , he informs us . One of the proofreadersfell down the elevator shaft . Not expected to live . At first Van Norden is shocked , deeply shocked . But when he learns that it was Peckover , the Englishman , he looks relieved . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's better 7off dead than alive . He just got his false teeth the other day too .... " The allusion to the false teeth moves the man upstairs to tears . He relates in a slobbery way a little incident connected with the accident . He is upset about it , more upset about this little incident than about the catastrophe itself . It seems that Peckover , when he hit the bottom of the shaft , regained consciousness before anyone could reach him . Despite the fact that his legs were broken and his ribs busted , he had managed to rise to all fours and grope about for his false teeth . In the ambulance he was crying out in his delirium for the teeth he had lost . The incident was pathetic and ludicrous at the same time . The guy from upstairs hardly knew whether to laugh or to weep as he related it . It was a delicate moment because with a drunk like that , one false move and he 'd crash a bottle over your skull . He had never been particularly friendly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely ever set foot in the proofreading department : there was an invisiblewall like between the guys upstairs and the guys down below . But now , since he had felt the touch of death , he wanted to display his comradeship . He wanted to weep , if possible , to show that he was a regular guy . And Joe and I , who knew Peckover well and who knew also that he was n't worth a good goddamn , even a few tears , we felt annoyed with this drunken sentimentality . We wanted to tell him so too , but with a guy like that you ca n't afford to be honest ; you have to buy a wreath and go to the funeral and pretend that you 're miserable . And you have to congratulate him too for the delicate obituary he 's written . He 'll be carrying his delicate little obituary around with him for months , praising the shit out of himself for the way he handled the situation . We felt all that , Joe and I , without saying a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a murderous , silent contempt . And as soon as we could break away we did so ; we left him there at the bar blubbering to himself over his Pernod . Once out of his sight we began to laugh hysterically . The false teeth ! No matter what we said about the poor devil , and we said some good things about him too , we always came back to the false teeth . There are people in this world who cut such a grotesque figure that even death renders them ridiculous . And the more horrible the death the more ridiculous they seem . It 's no use trying to invest the end with a little dignity  --  you have to be a liar and a hypocrite to discover anything tragic in their going . And since we did n't have to put on a false front we could laugh about the incident to our heart 's content . We laughed all night about it , and in between times we vented our scorn and disgust for the guys upstairs , the fatheads who were trying to persuade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow and that his death was a catastrophe . All sorts of funny recollections came to our minds  --  the semicolonsthat he overlooked and for which they bawled the piss out of him . They made his life miserable with their fucking little semicolons and the fractions which he alwaysgot wrong . They were even going to fire him once because he came to work with a boozy breath . They despisedhim because he always looked so miserable and because he had eczema and dandruff . He was just a nobody , as far as they were concerned , but , now that he was dead , they would all chip in lustily and buy him a huge wreath and they 'd put his name in big type in the obituary column . Anything to throw a little reflection on themselves ; they 'd make him out to be a big shit if they could . But unfortunately , with Peckover , there was little they couldP 139invent about him . He was a zero , and even the fact that he was dead would n't add a cipher to his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Joe . " You may get his job . And if you have any luck , maybe you 'll fall down the elevator shaft and break your neck too . We 'll buy you a nice wreath , I promise you that . " Toward dawn we 're sitting on the terrasse of the Dome . We 've forgotten about poor Peckover long ago . We 've had a little excitement at the Bal Negre and Joe 's mind has slipped back to the eternal preoccupation : cunt . It 's at this hour , when his night off is almost concluded , that his restlessness mounts to a fever pitch . He thinks of the women he passed up earlier in the evening and of the steady ones he might have had for the asking , if it were n't that he was fed up with them . He is reminded inevitably of his Georgia cunt  --  she 's been hounding him lately , begginghim to take her in , at least until she can find herself a job . " I do n't mind giving her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but I could n't take her on as a steady thing ... she 'd ruin it for my other cunts . " What gripes him most about her is that she does n't put on any flesh . " It 's like taking a skeleton to bed with you , " he says . " The other night I took her on  --  out of pity  --  and what do you think the crazy hitch , had done to herself ? She had shaved it clean ... not a speck of hair on it . Did you ever have a woman who shaved her twat ? It 's repulsive , ai n't it ? And it 's funny , too . Sort of mad like . It does n't look like a twat any more : it 's like a dead clam or something . " He describesto me how , his curiosity aroused , he got out of bed and searched for his flashlight . " I made her hold it open and I trained the flashlight on it . You should have seen me . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that 1 forgot all about her . I never in my life looked at a cuntP140so seriously . You 'd imagine I 'd never seen one before . And the more I looked at it the less interesting it became . It only goes to show you there 's nothing to it after all , especially when it 's shaved . It 's the hair that makes it mysterious . That 's why a statue leaves you cold . Only once I saw a real cunt on a statue  --  that was by Rodin . You ought to sec it some time . . . she has her legs spread wide apart . . . . I do n't think there was any head on it . Just a cunt you might say . Jesus , it looked ghastly . The thing is this  --  they all look alike . When you look at them with their clothes on you imagine all sorts of things : you give them an individuality like , which they have n't got , of course . There 's just a crack there between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't even look at it half the time . You know it 's there and all you think about is getting your ramrod inside ; it 's as though your penis did the thinking for you . It 's an illusion ! You get all burned up about nothing . . . about a crack with hair on it , or without hair . It 's so absolutely meaningless that it fascinated me to look at it . I must have studied it for ten minutes or more . When you look at it that way , sort of detached like , you get funny notions in your head . All that mystery about sex and then you discover that it 's nothing  --  just a blank . Would n't it be funny if you found a harmonica inside . . . or a calendar ? But there 's nothing there . . . nothing at all . It 's disgusting . It almost drove me mad . . . . Listen , do you know what I did afterwards ? I gave her a quick lay and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up a book and I read . You can get something out of a book , even a bad book . . . but a cunt , it 's just sheer loss of time . . . . " It just so happened that as he was concluding his speech a whore gave us the eye . Without the slightest transitionP141he says to me abruptly : " Would you like to give her a tumble ? It wo n't cost much . . . she 'll take the two of us on . " And without waiting for a reply he staggers to his feet and goes over to her . In a few minutes he comes back . " It 's all fixed , " he says . " Finish your beer . She 's hungry . There 's nothing doing any more at this hour . . . she 'll take the both of us for fifteen francs . We 'll go to my room . . . it 'll be cheaper . " On the way to the hotel the girl is shivering so that we have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather gentle sort of creature and not at all bad to look at . She evidently knows Van Norden , knows there 's nothing to expect from him but the fifteen francs . " You have n't got any dough , " he says , mumbling to me under his breath . As I have n't a centime in my pocket I do n't quite see the point of this , until he bursts out : " For Christ 's sake , remember that we 're broke . Do n't get tenderhearted when we get upstairs . She 's going to ask you for a little extra  --  I know this cunt ! I could get her for ten francs , if I wanted to . There 's no use spoiling them .... " " Il est mechant , celui-lc , " she says to me , gathering the drift of his remarks in her dull way . " Non , it n'est pas mechant , it est tres gentil . " She shakes her head laughingly . " Je le connais biers , ce type . " And then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back rent and the baby in the country . But she does n't overdo it . She knows that our ears are stopped ; but the misery is there inside her , like a stone , and there 's no room for any other thoughts . She is n't trying to make an appeal to our sympathies  --  she 's just shifting this big weight inside her from one place to another . I rather like her . I hope to Christ she has n't got a disease .... In the room she goes about her preparations mechani-P142cally . " There is n't a crust of bread about by any chance ? " she inquires , as she squats over the bidet . Van Norden laughs at this . " Here , take a drink , " he says , shoving a bottle at her . She does n't want anything to drink ; her stomach 's already on the bum , she complains . " That 's just a line with her , " says Van Norden . " Do n't let her work on your sympathies . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . How the hell can you get up any passion when you 've got a starving cunt on your hands ? " Precisely ! We have n't any passion either of us . And as for her , one might as well expect her to produce a diamondnecklace as to show a spark of passion . But there 's the fifteen francs and something has to be done about it . It 's like a state of war : the moment the condition is precipatcdnobody thinks about anything but peace , about getting it over with . And yet nobody has the courage to lay down his arms , to say , " I 'm fed up with it . . . I 'm through . " No , there 's fifteen francs somewhere , which nobody gives a damn about any more and which nobody is going to get in the end anyhow , but the fifteen francs is like the primal cause of things and rather than listen to one 's own voice , rather than walk out on the primal cause , one surrenders to the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one feels the more heroically does he behave , until a day when the bottom drops out and suddenly all the guns are silenced and the stretcher-bearers pick up the maimed and bleedingheroes and pin medals on their chest . Then one has the rest of his life to think about the fifteen francs . One has n't any eyes or arms or legs , but he has the consolation of dreaming for the rest of his days about the fifteen francs which everybody has forgotten . It 's exactly like a state of war  --  I ca n't get it out of myp143head . The way she works over me , to blow a spark of passion into me , makes me think what a damned poor soldier I 'd be if I was ever silly enough to be trapped like this and dragged to the front . I know for my part that I 'd surrender everything , honor included , in order to get out of the mess . I have n't any stomach for it , and that 's all there is to it . But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I do n't want to fight about it she 's going to make me fight . But you ca n't put fight into a man 's guts if he has n't any fight in him . There are some of us so cowardlythat you ca n't ever make heroes of us , not even if you frighten us to death . We know too much , maybe . There are some of us who do n't live in the moment , who live a little ahead , or a little behind . My mind is on the peace treaty all the time . I ca n't forget that it was the fifteen francs which started all the trouble . Fifteen francs ! What does fifteen francs mean to me , particularly since it 's not my fifteen francs ? Van Norden seems to have a more normal attitude about it . He does n't care a rap about the fifteen francs either now ; it 's the situation itself which intrigues him . It seems to call for a show of mettle  --  his manhood is involved . The fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's something more involved  --  not just manhoodperhaps , but will . It 's like a man in the trenches again : he does n't know any more why he should go on living , because if he escapes now he 'll only be caught later , but he goes on just the same , and even though he has the soul of a cockroach and has admitted as much to himself , give him a gun or a knife or even just his bare nails , and he 'll go on slaughtering and slaughtering , he 'd slaughter a million men rather than stop and ask himself why . As I watch Van Norden tackle her , it seems to me that I 'm looking at a machine whose cogs have slipped . Left to themselves , they could go on this way forever , grindingand slipping , without ever anything happening . Until a hand shuts the motor off . The sight of them coupled like a pair of goats without the least spark of passion , grinding and grinding away for no reason except the fifteen francs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inhumanone of satisfying my curiosity . The girl is lying on the edge of the bed and Van Norden is bent over her like a satyr with his two feet solidly planted on the floor . I am sitting on a chair behind him , watching their movementswith a cool , scientific detachment ; it does n't matter to me if it should last forever . It 's like watching one of those crazy machines which throw the newspaper out , millions and billions and trillions of them with their meaninglessheadlines . The machine seems more sensible , crazy as it is , and more fascinating to watch , than the human beings and the events which produced it . My interest in Van Norden and the girl is nil ; if I could sit like this and watch every single performance going on at this minute all over the world my interest would be even less than nil . I would n't be able to differentiate between this phenomenonand the rain falling or a volcano erupting . As long as that spark of passion is missing there is no human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch . And these two are like a machine which has slipped its cogs . It needs the touch of a human hand to set it right . It needs a mechanic . I get down on my knees behind Van Norden and I examinethe machine more attentively . The girl throws her head on one side and gives me a despairing look . " It 's no use , " she says . " It 's impossible . " Upon which Van Nordensets to work with renewed energy , just like an old billy goat . He 's such an obstinate cuss that he 'll break hisP 145horns rather than give up . And he 's getting sore now because I 'm tickling him in the rump . " For God 's sake , Joe , give it up ! You 'll kill the poor girl . " " Leave me alone , " he grunts . " I almost got it in that time . " The posture and the determined way in which he blurts this out suddenly bring to my mind , for the second time , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though that broomstick , which he had so nonchalantly slung under his arm , as he walked away , is lost forever . It is like the sequel to the dream  --  the same Van Norden , but minus the primal cause . He 's like a hero come back from the war , a poor maimed bastard living out the reality of his dreams . Wherever he sits himself the chair collapses ; whatever door he enters the room is empty ; whatever he puts in his mouth leaves a bad taste . Everything is just the same as it was before ; the elements are unchanged , the dream is no different than the reality . Only , between the time he went to sleep and the time he woke up , his body was stolen . He 's like a machine throwing out newspapers , millions and billions of them every day , and the front page is loaded with catastrophes , with riots , murders , explosions , collisions , but he does n't feel anything . If somebody does n't turn the switch off he 'll never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die if your own proper body has been stolen . You can get over a cunt and work away like a billy goat until eternity ; you can go to the trenches and be blown to bits ; nothing will create that spark of passion if there is n't the intervention of a human hand . Somebody has to put his hand into the machine and let it be wrenched off if the cogs are to mesh again . Somebodyhas to do this without hope of reward , without concernover the fifteen francs ; somebody whose chest is so thin that a medal would make him hunchbacked . And somebody has to throw a feed into a starving cunt without fear of pushing it out again . Otherwise this show 'll go on forever . There 's no way out of the mess ... . After sucking the boss 's ass for a whole week  --  it 's the thing to do here  --  I managed to land Peckover 's job . He died all right , the poor devil , a few hours after he hit the bottom of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a fine funeral , with solemn mass , huge wreaths , and everything . Tout compris . And after the ceremonies they regaled themselves , the upstairs guys , at a bistro . It was too bad Peckover could n't have had just a little snack  --  he would have appreciated it so much to sit with the men upstairs and hear his own name mentioned so frequently . I must say , right at the start , that I have n't a thing to complain about . It 's like being in a lunatic asylum , with permission to masturbate for the rest of your life . The world is brought right under my nose and all that is requestedof me is to punctuate the calamities . There is nothing in which these slick guys upstairs do not put their fingers : no joy , no misery passes unnoticed . They live among the hard facts of life , reality , as it is called . It is the reality of a swamp and they are the frogs who have nothing better to do than to croak . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , priest , doctor , politician , newspaperman  --  these are the quacks who have their fingers on the pulse of the world . A constant atmosphereof calamity . It 's marvelous . It 's as if the barometer never changed , as if the flag were always at half-mast . One can see now how the idea of heaven takes hold of men 's consciousness , how it gains ground even when all the props have been knocked from under it . There must be another world beside this swamp in which everything is dumped pell-mell . It 's hard to imagine what it can be like , P147this heaven that men dream about . A frog 's heaven , no doubt . Miasma , scum , pond lilies , stagnant water . Sit on a lily pad unmolested and croak all day . Something like that , I imagine . They have a wonderful therapeutic effect upon me , these catastrophes which I proofread . Imagine a state of perfect immunity , a charmed existence , a life of absolute security in the midst of poison bacilli . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faminenor collisions nor wars nor revolutions . I am inoculatedagainst every disease , every calamity , every sorrow and misery . It 's the culmination of a life of fortitude . Seated at my little niche all the poisons which the world gives off each day pass through my hands . Not even a fingernail gets stained . I am absolutely immune . I am even better off than a laboratory attendant , because there are no bad odors here , just the smell of lead burning . The world can blow up  --  I 'll be here just the same to put in a comma or a semicolon . I may even touch a little overtime , for with an event like that there 's bound to be a final extra . When the world blows up and the final edition has gone to press the proofreaders will quietly gather up all commas , semicolons , hyphens , asterisks , brackets , parentheses , periods , exclamation marks , etc. and put them in a little box over the editorial chair . Comme fatout est regle . . None of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They grumble all the time , they have ambitions , they want to show their pride and spleen . A good proofreader has no ambitions , no pride , no spleen . A good proofreader is a little like God Almighty , he 's in the world but not of it . He 's for Sundays only . Sunday is his night off . On Sundays he steps down from his pedestaland shows his ass to the faithful . Once a week he listens in on all the private grief and misery of the world ; it 's enough to last him for the rest of the week . The rest of the week he remains in the frozen winter marshes , an absolute , an impeccable absolute , with only a vaccination mark to distinguish him from the immense void . The greatest calamity for a proofreader is the threat of losing his job . When we get together in the break the question that sends a shiver down our spines is : what 'll you do if you lose your jot ) ? For the man in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the supreme terror is the possibility of a world without horses . To tell him that it is disgusting to spend one 's life shoveling up hot turds is a piece of imbecility . A man can get to love shit if his livelihood depends on it , if his happiness is involved . This life which , if I were still a man with pride , honor , ambition and so forth , would seem like the bottom rung of degradation , I welcome now , as an invalid welcomes death . It 's a negative reality , just like death  --  a sort of heaven without the pain and terror of dying . In this chthonian world the only thing of importance is orthographyand punctuation . It does n't matter what the nature of the calamity is , only whether it is spelled right . Everything is on one level , whether it be the latest fashion for evening gowns , a new battleship , a plague , a high explosive , an astronomic discovery , a bank run , a railroad wreck , a bull market , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assassination , or what .

To the Hindoo Agha Mir , Madam Scheer ( formerly Miss Esteve ) writes saying she is quite satisfied with his work . " I was married June 6th and I thank you .

In the same edition I notice a headline announcingthat " the universe is expanding so fast it may burst " and underneath it is the photograph of a splitting headache . And then there is a spiel about the pearl , signed Tecla . The oyster produces both , he informs all and sundry . Both the " wild " or Oriental pearl , and the " cultured " pearl . On the same day , at the Cathedral of Trier , the Germans are exhibiting the Coat of Christ ; it 's the first time it 's been taken out of the moth balls in forty-two years . Nothing said about the pants and vest . In Salzburg , also the same day , two mice were born in a man 's stomach , believe it or not .

" And whenever there is an explosion in a coal mine  --  a British coal mine  --  notice please that the King and Queen always send their condolences promptly , by telegraph . And they always attend the important races , though the other day , according to the copy , it was at the Derby , I believe , " heavy rains began to fall , much to the surprise of the King and Queen . " More heart-rending , however , is an item like this : " It is claimed in Italy that the persecutions are not against the Church , but neverthelessthey are conducted against the most exquisite parts of the Church . It is claimed that they arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very heart and eyes of the Pope . " I had to travel precisely all around the world to find just such a comfortable , agreeable niche as this . It seems incrediblealmost . How could I have foreseen , in America , with all those firecrackers they put up your ass to give you pep and courage , that the ideal position for a man of my temperament was to look for orthographic mistakes ? Over there you think of nothing but becoming President of the United States some day . Potentially every man is Presidential timber . Here it 's different . Here every man is potentially a zero . If you become something or somebodyit is an accident , a miracle . The chances are a thousandto one that you will never leave your native village . The chances are a thousand to one that you 'll have your legs shot off or your eyes blown out . Unless the miracle happens and you find yourself a general or a rear admiral . Rut it 's just because the chances are all against you , just because there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . Day by day . No yesterdays and no tomorrows . The barometernever changes , the flag is always at half-mast . You wear a piece of black crepe on your arm , you have a little ribbon in your buttonhole , and , if you are lucky enough to afford it , you buy yourself a pair of artificial lightweight limbs , aluminum preferably . Which does notP151prevent you from enjoying an aperitif or looking at the animals in the zoo or flirting with the vultures who sail up and down the boulevards always on the alert for fresh carrion . Time passes . If you 're a stranger and your papers are in order you can expose yourself to infection without fear of being contaminated . It is better , if possible , to have a proofreader 's job . Corneae fa , tout s'arrange . That means , that if you happen to be strolling home at three in the morning and you are intercepted by the bicycle cops , you can snap your fingers at them . In the morning , when the market is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centimes apiece . A proofreader does n't get up usually until noon , or a little after . It 's well to choose a hotel near a cinema , because if you have a tendency to oversleep the bells will wake you up in time for the matinee . Or if you ca n't find a hotel near a cinema , choose one near a cemetery , it comes to the same thing . Above all , never despair . Ii ne faut jamais desesperer . Which is what I try to din into Carl and Van Norden every night . A world without hope , but no despair . It 's as though I had been converted to a new religion , as though I were making an annual novena every night to Our Lady of Solace . I ca n't imagine what there would be to gain if I were made editor of the paper , or even Presidentof the United States . I 'm up a blind alley , and it 's cosy and comfortable . With a piece of copy in my hand I listen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the tinkle of the linotype machines , as if there were a thousand silver bracelets passing through a wringer ; now and then a rat scurries past our feet or a cockroach descends the wall in front of us , moving ninthly and gingerly on his delicate legs . The events of the day are slid under your nose , quietly , unostentatiously , with , now and then , a by-line to mark the presence of ap152human hand , an ego , a touch of vanity . The procession passes serenely , like a cortege entering the cemetery gates . The paper under the copy desk is so thick that it almost feels like a carpet with a soft nap . Under Van Norden 's desk it is stained with brown juice . Around eleven o'clock the peanut vendor arrives , a half-wit of an Armenian who is also content with his lot in life . Now and then I get a cablegram from Mona saying that she 's arriving on the next boat . " Letter following , " it always says . It 's been going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her name in the list of boat arrivals , nor does the garcon ever bring me a letter on a silver platter . I have n't any more expectations in that direction either . If she ever does arrive she can look for me downstairs , just behind the lavatory . She 'll probably tell me right away that it 's unsanitary . That 's the first thing that strikes an American woman about Europe  --  that it 's unsanitary . Impossible for them to conceive of a paradise without modern plumbing . If they find a bedbug they want to write a letter immediately to the chamber of commerce . I low am I ever going to explain to her that I 'm contented here ? She 'll say I 've become a degenerate . I know her line from beginning to end . She 'll want to look for a studio with a garden attached  --  and a bathtub to be sure . She wants to be poor in a romantic way . I know her . But I 'm prepared for her this time . There are days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get off the beaten path and think about her hungrily . Now and then , despite my grim satisfaction , I get to thinking about another way of life , get to wondering if it would make a difference having a young , restless creature by my side . The trouble is I can hardly remember what she looks like , nor even how it feels to have my arms around her . Everything that belongs to the past seems to have fallen 3into the sea ; I have memories , but the images have lost their vividness , they seem dead and desultory , like timebittenmummies stuck in a quagmire . If I try to recall my life in New York I get a few splintered fragments , nightmarishand covered with verdigris . It seems as if my own proper existence had come to an end somewhere , just where exactly I ca n't make out . I 'm not an American any more , nor a New Yorker , and even less a European , or a Parisian . I have n't any allegiance , any responsibilities , any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm neither for nor against . I 'm a neutral . When we walk home of a night , the three of us , it often happens after the first spasms of disgust that we get to talking about the condition of things with that enthusiasm which only those who bear no active part in life can muster . What seems strange to me sometimes , when I crawl into bed , is that all this enthusiasm is engendered just to kill time , just to annihilate the three-quarters of an hour which it requires to walk from the office to Montparnasse . We might have the most brilliant , the most feasible ideas for the amelioration of this or that , but there is no vehicle to hitch them to . And what is more strange is that the absence of any relationship between ideas and living causes us no anguish , no discomfort . We have become so adjusted that , if tomorrow we were ordered to walk on our hands , we would do so without the slightest protest . Provided , of course , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched our pay regularly . Otherwise nothing matters . Nothing . We have become Orientalized . We have become coolies , white-collar coolies , silenced by a handful of rice each day . A special feature in American skulls , I was reading the other day , is the presence of the epactal bone , or os Incae , in the occiput . The presence of this bone , so the savant went on to say , is due to a per-P154sistence of the transverse occipital suture which is usually closed in fetal life . Hence it is a sign of arrested developmentand indicative of an inferior race . " The average cubicalcapacity of the American skull , " so he went on to say , " falls below that of the white , and rises above that of the black race . Taking both sexes , the Parisians of today have a cranial capacity of 1,448 cubic centimeters ; the Negroes 1,344 centimeters ; the American Indians 1,376 . " From all of which I deduce nothing because I am an American and not an Indian . But it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an os Incae , for example . It does n't disturb his theory at all to admit that single examplesof Indian skulls have yielded the extraordinary capacity of 1,920 cubic centimeters , a cranial capacity not exceeded in any other race . What I note with satisfactionis that the Parisians , of both sexes , seem to have a normal cranial capacity . The transverse occipital suture is evident Iv not so persistent with them . They know how to enjoy an aperitif and they do n't worry if the houses are unpainted . There 's nothing extraordinary about their skulls , so far as cranial indices go . There must be some other explanation for the art of living which they have brought to such a degree of perfection . At Monsieur Paul 's , the bistro across the way , there is a back room reserved for the newspapermen where we can cat on credit . It is a pleasant little room with sawdust on the floor and flies in season and out . When I say that it is reserved for the newspapermen I do n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary , it means that we have the privilege of associating with the whores and pimps who form the more substantial element of MonsierPaul 's clientle . The arrangement suits the guys upstairs to a T , because they 're always on the lookout for tail , and even those who have a steady little French girlP155are not averse to making a switch now and then . The principal thing is not to get a dose ; at times it would seem as if an epidemic had swept the office , or perhaps it might be explained by the fact that they all sleep with the same woman . Anyhow , it 's gratifying to observe how miserablethey can look when they are obliged to sit beside a pimp who , despite the little hardships of his profession , lives a life of luxury by comparison . I 'm thinking particularly now of one tall , blonde fellow who delivers the Havas messages by bicycle . He is always a little late for his meal , always perspiring profusely and his face covered with grime . He has a fine , awkward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and making a beeline for the sink which is just between the toilet and the kitchen . As he wipes his face he gives the edibles a quick inspection ; if he sees a nice steak lying on the slab he picks it up and sniffs it , or he will dip the ladle into the big pot and try a mouthful of soup . He 's like a line bloodhound , his nose to the ground all the time . The preliminaries over , having made peepee and blown his nose vigorously , he walks nonchalantly over to his wench and gives her a big , smacking kiss together with an affec-t ionate pat on the rump . Her , the wench , I 've never seen look anything but immaculate  --  even at three a.m. , after an evening 's work . She looks exactly as if she had just stepped out of a Turkish bath . It 's a pleasure to look at such healthy brutes , to see such repose , such affection , such appetite as they display . It 's the evening meal I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before enteringupon her duties . In a little while she will be obliged to take leave of her big blonde brute , to flop somewhere on the boulevard and sip her digestif . If the job is irksome or wearing or exhaustive , she certainly does n't show it . When the big fellow arrives , hungry as a wolf , she puts her arms around him and kisses him hungrily  --  his eyes , nose , cheeks , hair , the back of his neck . . . she 'd kiss his ass if it could be done publicly . She 's grateful to him , that 's evident . She 's no wage slave . All through the meal she laughs convulsively . You would n't think she had a care in the world . And now and then , by way of affection , she gives him a resounding slap in the face , such a whack as would knock a proofreader spinning . They do n't scent to be aware of anything but themselves and the food that they pack away in shovelsful . Such perfect contentment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norden crazy to watch them . Especially when she slips her hand in the big fellow'sfly and caresses it , to which he generally responds by grabbing her teat and squeezing it playfully . " I'here is another couple who arrive usually about the same tulle and they behave just like two married people . they have their spats , they wash their linen in public and after they 've made things disagreeable for themselves and everybody else , after threats and curses and reproachesand recriminations , they make up for it by billingand cooing , just like a pair of turtle doves . Lucienne , as he calls her , is a heavy platinum blonde with a cruel , saturnine air . She has a full underlip which she chews venomously when her temper runs away with her . And a cold , beady eye , a sort of faded china blue , which makes him sweat when she fixes him with it . But she 's a good sort , Iucienne , despite the condor-like profile which she presents to us when the squabbling begins . Her bag is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out cautiously , it is only because she does n't want to encourage him in his bad habits . He has a weak character ; that is , if one takes Lucienne 's tirades seriously . He will spend fifty francs of an evening while waiting for her to get through . Whenp 157the waitress comes to take his order he has no appetite . " Ah , you 're not hungry again ! " growls Lucienne . " Humpf ! You were waiting for me , I suppose , on the Faubourg Montmartre . You had a good time , I hope , while I slaved for you . Speak , imbecile , where were you ? " When she flares up like that , when she gets enraged , he looks up at her timidly and then , as if he had decided that silence was the best course , he lets his head drop and he fiddles with his napkin . But this little gesture , which she knows so well and which of course is secretly pleasing to her because she is convinced now that he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , imbecile ! " she shrieks . And with a squeaky , timid little voice he explains to her woefully that while waiting for her he got so hungry that he was obliged to stop off for a sandwich and a glass of beer . It was just enough to ruin his appetite  --  hesays it dolefully , though it 's apparent that food just now is the least of his worries . " But "  --  and he tries to make his voice sound more convincing  --  " I was waiting for you all the time , " he blurts out . " Liar ! " she screams . " Liar ! Ah , fortunately , I too am a liar . . . a good liar . You make me ill with your petty little lies . Why do n't you tell me a big lie ? " He hangs his head again and absent-mindedly he gathers a few crumbs and puts them to his mouth . Whereuponshe slaps his hand . " Do n't do that ! You make me tired . You 're such an imbecile . Liar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am a liar too , but I am not an imbecile . " In a little while , however , they are sitting close together , their hands locked , and she is murmuring softly : " Ah , my little rabbit , it is hard to leave you now . Come here , kiss mc ! What are you going to do this evening ? Tell mc the truth , my little one . . . . I am sorry that I have such an ugly temper . " He kisses her timidly , just like a littlep158bunny with long pink ears ; gives her a little peck on the lips as if he were nibbling a cabbage leaf . And at the same time his bright round eyes fall caressingly on her purse which is lying open beside her on the bench . He is only waiting for the moment when he can graciously give her the slip ; he is itching to get away , to sit down in some quiet cafe on the Ruc du Faubourg Montmartre . I know him , the innocent little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rabbit . And 1 know what a devil 's street is the Faubourg Montmartre with its brass plates and rubber goods , the lights twinkling all night and sex running through the street like a sewer . To walk from the Rue Lafayette to the boulevard is like running the gauntlet ; they attach themselves to you like barnacles , they eat into you like ants , they coax , wheedle , cajole , implore , beseech , they try it out in German , English , Spanish , they show you their torn hearts and their busted shoes , and long after you 've chopped the tentacles away , long after the fizz and sizzle has died out , the fragrance of the lavabo clings to your nostrils  --  it is the odor of the Parfum de Danse whose effectiveness is guaranteed only for a distance of twenty centimeters . One could piss away a whole lifetime in that little stretch between the boulevard and the Rue Lafayette . Every bar is alive , throbbing , the dice loaded ; the cashiers are perched like vultures on their high stools and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no equivalent in the Banque de France for the blood money that passes currency here , the money that glistens with human sweat , that passes like a forest fire from hand to hand and leaves behind it a smoke and stench . A man who can walk through the Faubourg Montmartre at night without panting or sweating , without a prayer or a curse on his lips , a man like that has no balls , and if he has , then he ought to be castrated . P159Supposing the timid little rabbit does spend fifty francs of an evening while waiting for his Lucienne ? Supposinghe does get hungry and buy a sandwich and a glass of beer , or stop and chat with somebody else 's trollop ? You think he ought to be weary of that round night after night ? You think it ought to weigh on him , oppress him , bore him to death ? You do n't think that a pimp is inhuman , I hope ? A pimp has his private grief and misery too , do n't you forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner every night with a pair of white dogs and watch them piddle . Perhaps he would like it if , when he opened the door , he would see her there reading the Paris-Soir , her eyes already a little heavy with sleep . Perhaps it is n't so wonderful , when he bends over his Lucienne , to taste another man 's breath . Better maybe to have only three francs in your pocket and a pair of white dogs that piddle on the corner than to taste those bruised lips . Bet you , when she squeezes him tight , when she begs for that little package of love which only he knows how to deliver , bet you he fights like a thousand devils to pump it up , to wipe out that regiment that has marched between her legs . Maybe when he takes her body and practices a new tune , maybe it is n't all passion and curiosity with him , but a fight in the dark , a fight single-handed against the army that rushed the gates , the army that walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a devouring hunger that not even a Rudolph Valentino could appease . When I listen to the reproaches that are leveled against a girl like Lucienne , when I hear her being denigrated or despised because she is cold and mercenary , because she is too mechanical , or because she 's in too great a hurry , or because this or because that , I say to myself , hold on there bozo , not so fast ! Rememberthat you 're far back in the procession ; remember that a whole army corps has laid siege to her , that she 's been laid waste , plundered and pillaged . I say to myself , listen , bozo , do n't begrudge the fifty francs you hand her because you know her pimp is pissing it away in the FaubourgMontmartre . It 's her money and her pimp . It 's blood money . It 's money that 'll never be taken out of circulation because there 's nothing in the Banque de France to redeem it with . That 's how I think about it often when I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untangling the cables from Chicago , London and Montreal . In between the rubber and silk markets and the Winnipeg grains there oozes a little of the fizz and sizzle of the Faubourg Montmartre . When the bonds go weak and spongy and the pivotals balk and the volatiles effervesce , when the grain market slips and slides and the bulls commenceto roar , when every fucking calamity , every ad , every sport item and fashion article , every boat arrival , every travelogue , every tag of gossip has been punctuated , checked , revised , pegged and wrung through the silver bracelets , when I hear the front page being hammeredinto whack and see the frogs dancing around like drunken squibs , I think of Lucienne sailing down the boulevard with her wings outstretched , a huge silver condorsuspended over the sluggish tide of traffic , a strange bird from the tips of the Andes with a rose-white belly and a tenacious little knob . Sometimes I walk home alone and I follow her through the dark streets , follow her through the court of the Louvre , over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fents and slits , the somnolence , the drugged whiteness , the grill of the Luxembourg , the tangled boughs , the snores and groans , the green slats , the strum and tinkle , the points of the stars , P161the spangles , the jetties , the blue and white striped awningsthat she brushed with the tips of her wings . In the blue of an electric dawn the peanut shells look wan and crumpled ; along the beach at Montparnasse the water lilies bend and break . When the tide is on the ebb and only a few syphilitic mermaids are left stranded in the muck , the Dome looks like a shooting gallery that 's been struck by a cyclone . Everything is slowly dribbling back to the sewer . For about an hour there is a deathlike calm during which the vomit is mopped up . Suddenly the trees begin to screech . From one end of the boulevard to the other a demented song rises up . It is like the signal that announces the close of the exchange . What hopes there were are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last bagful of urine . The day is sneaking in like a leper ... . One of the things to guard against when you work nights is not to break your schedule ; if you do n't get to bed before the birds begin to screech it 's useless to go to bed at all . This morning , having nothing better to do , I visited the Jardin des Plantes . Marvelous pelicans here from Chapultepec and peacocks with studded fans that look at you with silly eyes . Suddenly it began to rain . Returning to Montparnasse in the bus I noticed a little French woman opposite me who sat stiff and erect as if she were getting ready to preen herself . She sat on the edge of the seat as if she feared to crush her gorgeous tail . Marvelous , I thought , if suddenly she shook herself and from her derriere there sprung open a huge studded fan with long silken plumes . At the Cafe de 1'Avenue , where I stop for a bite , a woman with a swollen stomach tries to interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to a room with her and while away an hour or two . It is the first time I have ever been propositioned by a pregnant woman : I am almost tempted to try it . As soon as the baby is born and handed over to the authorities she will go back to her trade , she says . She makes hats . Observing that my interest is waning she takes my hand and puts it on her abdomen . I feel somethingstirring inside . It takes my appetite away . I have never seen a place like Paris for varieties of sexual provender . As soon as a woman loses a front tooth or an eye or a leg she goes on the loose . In America she 'd starve to death if she had nothing to recommend her but a mutilation . Here it is different . A missing tooth or a nose eaten away or a fallen womb , any misfortune that aggravatesthe natural homeliness of the female , seems to be regarded as an added spice , a stimulant for the jaded appetitesof the male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar to the big cities , the world of men and women whose last drop of juice has been squeezed out by the machine  --  the martyrs of modern progress . It is this mass of bones and collar buttons which the painter finds so difficult to put flesh on . It is only later , in the afternoon , when I find myself in an art gallery on the Rue de Seze , surrounded by the men and women of Matisse , that I am drawn back again to the proper precincts of the human world . On the threshold of that big hall whose walls are now ablaze , I pause a moment to recover from the shock which one experiences when the habitual gray of the world is rent asunder and the color of life splashes forth in song and poem . I find myself in a world so natural , so complete , that I am lost . I have the sensation of being immersed in the very plexus of life , focal from whatever place , position or attitude I take my stance . Lost as when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seated in the dining room of thatP163enormous world of Balbec , I caught for the first time the profound meaning of those interior stills which manifest their presence through the exorcism of sight and touch . Standing on the threshold of that world which Matisse has created I re-experienced the power of that revelation which had permitted Proust to so deform the picture of life that only those who , like himself , are sensible to the alchemy of sound and sense , are capable of transforming the negative reality of life into the substantial and significantoutlines of art . Only those who can admit the light into their gizzards can translate what is there in the heart . Vividly now I recall how the glint and sparkle of light caroming from the massive chandeliers splintered and ran blood , flecking the tips of the waves that beat monotonouslyon the dull gold outside the windows . On the beach , masts and chimneys interlaced , and like a fuliginous shadow the figure of Albertine gliding through the surf , fusing into the mysterious quick and prism of a protoplasmicrealm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the close of day , pain rising like a mist from the earth , sorrow closing in , shuttering the endless vista of sea and sky . Two waxen hands lying listlessly on the bedspread and along the pale veins the fluted murmur of a shell repeating the legend of its birth . In every poem by Matisse there is the history of a particle of human flesh which refused the consummation of death . The whole run of flesh , from hair to nails , expressesthe miracle of breathing , as if the inner eye , in its thirst for a greater reality , had converted the pores of the flesh into hungry seeing mouths . By whatever vision one passes there is the odor and the sound of voyage . It is impossible to gaze at even a corner of his dreams without feeling the lift of the wave and the cool of flying spray . He stands at the helm peering with steady blue eyes intoP164the portfolio of time . Into what distant corners has he not thrown his long , slanting gaze ? Looking down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cordilleras falling away into the Pacific , the history of the Diaspora done in vellum , shutters fluting the froufrou of the beach , the piano curving like a conch , corollas giving out diapasons of light , chameleons squirming under the book press , seraglios expiring in oceans of dust , music issuinglike fire from the hidden chromosphere of pain , spore and madreporc fructifying the earth , navels vomitingtheir bright spawn of anguish . . . . He is a bright sage , a dancing seer who , with a sweep of the brush , removes the ugly scaffold to which the body of man is chained by the incontrovertible facts of life . He it is , if any man today possesses the gift , who knows where to dissolve the humanfigure , who has the courage to sacrifice an harmoniousline in order to detect the rhythm and murmur of the blood , who takes the light that has been refracted inside him and lets it flood the keyboard of color . Behind the minutiae , the chaos , the mockery of life , he detects the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigment of space . No searching for formulae , no crucifixion of ideas , no compulsion other than to create . Even as the world goes to smash there is one man who remains at the core , who becomes more solidly fixed and anchored , more centrifugal as the process of dissolutionquickens . More and more the world resembles an entomologist 's dream . The earth is moving out of its orbit , the axis has shifted ; from the north the snow blows down in huge knife-blue drifts . A new ice age is setting in , the transversesutures are closing up and everywhere throughout the corn belt the fetal world is dying , turning to dead mastoid . Inch by inch the deltas are drying out and thep165river beds are smooth as glass . A new day is dawning , a metallurgical day , when the earth shall clink with showersof bright yellow ore . As the thermometer drops , the form of the world grows blurred ; osmosis there still is , and here and there articulation , but at the periphery the veins are all varicose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun bleeds like a broken rectum . At the very hub of this wheel which is falling apart , is Matisse . And he will keep on rolling until everything that has gone to make up the wheel has disintegrated . He has already rolled over a goodly portion of the globe , over Persia and India and China , and like a magnet he has attached to himself microscopic particles from Kurd , Baluchistan , Timbuktu , Somaliland , Angkor , Tierra del Fuego . The odalisques he has studded with malachite and jasper , their flesh veiled with a thousand eyes , perfumed eyes dipped in the sperm of whales . Wherever a breeze stirs there are breasts as cool as jelly , white pigeons come to flutter and rut in the ice-blue veins of the Himalayas . The wallpaper with which the men of science have covered the world of reality is falling to tatters . The grand whorehouse which they have made of life requires no decoration ; it is essential only that the drains function adequately . Beauty , that feline beauty which has us by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new reality it is first necessary to dismantle the drains , to lay open the gangrened ducts which compose the genitourinarysystem that supplies the excreta of art . The odor of the day is permanganate and formaldehyde . The drains are clogged with strangled embryos . The world of Matisse is still beautiful in an old-fashionedbedroom way . There is not a ball bearing in evidence , nor a boiler plate , nor a piston , nor a monkey wrench . It is the same old world that went gaily to the Bois in the pastoral days of wine and fornication . I find it soothing and refreshing to move amongst these creatureswith live , breathing pores whose background is stable and solid as light itself . I feel it poignantly when I walk along the Boulevard de la Madeleine and the whores rustle beside me , when just to glance at them causes me to tremble . Is it because they are exotic or well-nourished ? No , it is rare to find a beautiful woman along the Boulevardde la Madeleine . But in Matisse , in the exploration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world which demands only the presence of the female to crystallize the most fugitive aspirations . To come upon a woman offeringherself outside a urinal , where there are advertised cigarette papers , rum , acrobats , horse races , where the heavy foliage of the trees breaks the heavy mass of walls and roofs , is an experience that begins where the boundariesof the known world leave off . In the evening now and then , skirting the cemetery walls , I stumble upon the phantom odalisques of Matisse fastened to the trees , their tangled manes drenched with sap . A few feet away , removedby incalculable eons of time , lies the prone and mummy-swathed ghost of Baudelaire , of a whole world that will belch no more . In the dusky corners of cafes are men and women with hands locked , their loins slatherflecked ; nearby stands the garcon with his apron full of sous , waiting patiently for the entr'acte in order to fall upon his wife and gouge her . Even as the world falls apart the Paris that belongs to Matisse shudders with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a stagnant sperm , the trees tangled like hair . On its wobbly axle the wheel rolls steadily downhill ; there are no brakes , no ball bearings , no balloon tires . The wheel is falling apart , but the revolution is intact ... .  |p167Out  of a clear sky there comes one day a letter from Boris whom I have not seen for months and months . It is a strange document and I do n't pretend to understand it all clearly . " What happened between us  --  at any rate , as far as I go  --  is that you touched me , touched my life , that is , at the one point where I am still alive : my death . By the emotional flow I went through another immersion . I lived again , alive . No longer by reminiscence , as I do with others , but alive . " That 's how it began . Not a word of greeting , no date , no address . Written in a thin , pompous scrawl on ruled paper torn out of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like me or not  --  deep down I rather think you hate me  --  you are very close to me . By you I know how I died : I see myself dying again : I am dying . That is something . More than to be dead simply . That may be the reason why I am so afraid to see you : you may have played the trick on me , and died . Things happen so fast nowadays . " I 'm reading it over , line by line , standing by the stones . It sounds nutty to me , all this palaver about life and death and things happening so fast . Nothing is happening that I can see , except the usual calamities on the front page . He 's been living all by himself for the last six months , tucked away in a cheap little room  --  probably holding telepathic communication with Cronstadt . He talks about the line falling back , the sector evacuated , and so on and so forth , as though he were dug into a trench and writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat on when he sat down to pen this missive , and he probablyp168rubbed his hands a few times as he used to do when a customer was calling to rent the apartment . " The reason I wanted you to commit suicide . . . " he begins again . At that I burst out laughing . He used to walk up and down with one hand stuck in the tail flap of his frock coat at the Villa Borghese , or at Cronstadt 's  --  wherever there was deck space , as it were  --  and reel off this nonsense about living and dying to his heart 's content . I never understooda word of it , I must confess , but it was a good show and , being a Gentile , I was naturally interested in what went on in that menagerie of a brainpan . Sometimes he would lie on his couch full length , exhausted by the surge of ideas that swept through his noodle . His feet just grazed the bookrack where he kept his Plato and Spinoza  --  he could n't understand why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made them sound interesting , though what it was all about I had n't the least idea . Sometimes I would glance at a volume furtively , to check up on these wild ideas which he imputed to them  --  but the connection was frail , tenuous . He had a language all his own , Boris , that is , when I had him alone ; but when I listened to Cronstadt it seemed to me that Boris had plagiarized his wonderful ideas . They talked a sort of higher mathematics , these two . Nothing of flesh and blood ever crept in ; it was weird , ghostly , ghoulishly abstract . When they got on to the dying business it sounded a little more concrete : after all , a cleaver or a meat ax has to have a handle . I enjoyed those sessions immensely . It was the first time in my life that death had ever seemed fascinating to me  --  all these abstract deaths which involved a bloodless sort of agony . Now and then they would compliment me on being alive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They made me feel that I was alive in the nineteenth century , a sort of atavistic remnant , a romantic shred , ap169soulful Pithecanthropus erectus . Boris especially seemed to get a great kick out of touching me ; he wanted me to be alive so that he could die to his heart 's content . You would think that all those millions in the street were nothing but dead cows the way he looked at me and touched me . But the letter . . . I 'm forgetting the letter ... . " The reason why I wanted you to commit suicide that evening at the Cronstadts ' , when Moldorf became God , was that I was very close to you then . Perhaps closer than I shall ever be . And I was afraid , terribly afraid , that some day you 'd go back on me , die on my hands . And I would be left high and dry with my idea of you simply , and nothing to sustain it . I should never forgive you for that . " Perhaps you can visualize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not clear what his idea of me was , or at any rate , it 's clear that I was just pure idea , an idea that kept itself alive without food . He never attached much importance , Boris , to the food problem . He tried to nourish me with ideas . Everything was idea . Just the same , when he had his heart set on renting the apartment , he would n't forget to put a new washer in the toilet . Anyway , he did n't want me to die on his hands . " You must be life for me to the very end , " so he writes . " That is the only way in which you can sustain my idea of you . Because you have gotten , as you see , tied up with something so vital to me , I do not think I shall ever shake you off . Nor do I wish to . I want you to live more vitally every day , as I am dead . That is why , when I speak of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's hard to talk of one 's self so intimately . " You would imagine perhaps that he was anxious to see me , or that he would like to know what I was doing  --  but no , not a line about the concrete or the personal , except in this living-dying language , nothing but this little message from the trenches , this whiff of poison gas to apprise all and sundry that the war was still on . I sometimes ask myselfhow it happens that I attract nothing but crackbrained individuals , neurasthenics , neurotics , psychopaths  --  and Jews especially . There must be something in a healthy Gentile that excites the Jewish mind , like when he sees sour black bread . There was Moldorf , for example , who had made himself God , according to Boris and Cronstadt . He positively hated me , the little viper  --  yet he could n't stay away from me . I le came round regularly for his little dose of insults  --  it was like a tonic to him . In the beginning , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was paying me to listen to him . And though I never displayed much sympathy l knew how to be silent when it involved a meal and a little pin money . After a while , however , seeingwhat a masochist he was , I permitted myself to laugh in his face now and then ; that was like a whip for him , it made the grief and agony gush forth with renewed vigor . And perhaps everything would have gone smoothly between us if he had not felt it his duty to protect Tania . But Tania being a Jewess , that brought up a moral question . He wanted me to stick to Mlle. Claude for whom , I must admit , I had a genuine affection . He even gave me money occasionally to sleep with her . Until he realized that I was a hopeless lecher . I mention Tania now because she 's just got back from Russia  --  just a few days ago . Sylvester remained behind to worm his way into a job . He 's given up literature entirely . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to go back there with her , to the Crimea preferably , and start a new life . We had a fine drinking bout up in Carl 's room the other day discussing the possibilities . I wanted to know what I could do for a living back there  --  if I could be a proofreader , for example . She said I did n't need to worry about what I would do  --  theyp171would find a job for me as long as I was earnest and sincere . I tried to look earnest , but I only succeeded in looking pathetic . They do n't want to see sad faces in Russia ; they want you to be cheerful , enthusiastic , lighthearted , optimistic . It sounded very much like America to me . I was n't born with this kind of enthusiasm . I did n't let on to her , of course , but secretly I was praying to be left alone , to go back to my little niche , and to stay there until the war breaks . All this hocus-pocus about Russia disturbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tania , that we finished almost a half dozen bottles of vin ordinaire . Carl was jumping about like a cockroach . He has just enough Jew in him to lose his head over an idea like Russia . Nothing would do but to marry us off  --  immediately . " Hitch up ! " he says , " you have nothing to lose ! " And then he pretends to run a little errand so that we can pull off a fast one . And while she wanted it all right , Tania , still that Russia business had gotten so solidly planted in her skull that she pissed the interval away chewing my ear off , which made me somewhat grumpy and ill at ease . Anyway , we had to think about eating and getting to the office , so we piled into a taxi on the Boulevard EdgarQuinet , just a stone 's throw away from the cemetery , and off we whizzed . It was just a nice hour to spin through Paris in an open cab , and the wine rolling around in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carl was sitting opposite us , on the strapontin , his face as red as a beet . He was happy , the poor bastard , thinking what a glorious new life he would lead on the other side of Europe . And at the same time he felt a bit wistful , too  --  I could see that . He did n't really want to leave Paris , any more than I did . Paris had n't been good to him , any more than it had to me , or to anybody , for that matter , but when you 've suffered and endured things here it 's then that Paris takes hold of you , grabs you by the balls , you might say , like some lovesick bitch who 'd rather die than let you get out of her hands . That 's how it looked to him , I could see that . Rolling over the Seine he had a big foolish grin on his face and he looked around at the buildings and the statues as though he were seeing them in a dream . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had my hand in Tania 's bosom and I was squeezing her tittics with all my might and I noticed the water under the bridges and the barges and Notre-Dame down below , just like the post cards show it , and I was thinking drunkenly to myself that 's how one gets fucked , but I was sly about it too and I knew I would n't ever trade all this whirling about my head for Russia or heaven or anything on earth . It was a fine afternoon , I was thinking to myself , and soon we 'd be pushing a feed down our bellies and what could we order as a specialtreat , some good heavy wine that would drown out all this Russia business . With a woman like Tania , full of sap and everything , they do n't give a damn what happens to you once they get an idea in their heads . Let them go far enough and they 'll pull the pants off you , right in the taxi . It was grand though , milling through the traffic , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sewer inside us , especially when we swung into the Rue Laffitte which is just wide enough to frame the little temple at the end of the street and above it the SacreCccur , a kind of exotic jumble of architecture , a lucid French idea that gouges right through your drunkenness and leaves you swimming helplessly in the past , in a fluid dream that makes you wide awake and yet does n't jar your nerves . With Tania back on the scene , a steady job , the drunken talk about Russia , the walks home at night , and Paris in full summer , life seems to lift its head a littlep 17 3higher . That 's why perhaps , a letter such as Boris sent me seems absolutely cockeyed . Most every day I meet Tania around five o'clock , to have a Porto with her , as she calls it . I let her take me to places I 've never seen before , the swell bars around the Champs-Elysees where the sound of jazz and baby voices crooning seems to soak right through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these pulpy , sappy strains pursue you , come floating into the cabinet through the ventilators and make life all soap and iridescent bubbles . And whether it 's becauseSylvester is away and she feels free now , or whatever it is , Tania certainly tries to behave like an angel . " You treated me lousy just before I went away , " she says to me one day . " Why did you want to act that way ? I never did anything to hurt you , did I ? " We were getting sentimental , what with the soft lights and that creamy , mahogany music seeping through the place . It was getting near time to go to work and we had n't eaten yet . The stubs were lying there in front of us  --  six francs , fourfifty , seven francs , two-fifty  --  I was counting them up mechanically and wondering too at the same time if I would like it better being a bartender . Often like that , when she was talking to me , gushing about Russia , the future , love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking about the most irrelevant things , about shining shoes or being a lavatory attendant , particularly I suppose because it was so cosy in these joints that she dragged me to and it never occurred to me that I 'd be stone sober and perhaps old and bent . . . no , I imagined always that the future , however modest , would be in just this sort of ambiance , with the same tunes playing through my head and the glasses clinking and behind every shapely ass a trail of perfume a yard wide that would take the stink out of life , even downstairs in the lavabo.  | The strange thing is it never spoiled me trotting around to the swell bars with her like that . It was hard to leave her , certainly . I used to lead her around to the porch of a church near the office and standing there in the dark we 'd take a last embrace , she whispering to me " Jesus , what am I going to do now ? " She wanted me to quit the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did n't even care about Russia any more , just so long as we were together . But the moment I left her my head cleared . It was another kind of music , not so croony but good just the same , which greeted my cars when I pushed through the swingingdoor . And another kind of perfume , not just a yard wide , but omnipresent , a sort of sweat and patchouli that seemed to come from the machines . Coming in with a skinful , as I usually did , it was like dropping suddenly to a low altitude . Generally I made a beeline for the toilet  --  that braced me up rather . It was a little cooler there , or else the sound of water running made it seem so . It was always a cold douche , the toilet . It was real . Before you got inside you had to pass a line of Frenchmen peeling off their clothes . Ugh ! but they stank , those devils ! And they were well paid for it , too . But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some with beards , most of them pale , skinny rats with lead in their veins . Inside the toilet you could take an inventory of their idle thoughts . The walls were crowded with sketches and epithets , all of them jocosely obscene , easy to understand , and on the whole rather jolly and sympathetic . It must have required a ladder to reach certain spots , but I suppose it was worth while doing it even looking at it from just the psychological viewpoint . Sometimes , as I stood there taking a leak , I wondered what an impression it would make on those swell dames whom I observed passing in and out of the beautiful lavatories onp175the Champs-Elysees . I wondered if they would carry their tails so high if they could see what was thought of an ass here . In their world , no doubt , everything was gauze and velvet  --  or they made you think so with the fine scents they gave out , swishing past you . Some of them had n't always been such fine ladies either ; some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertise their trade . And maybe , when they were left alone with themselves , when they talked out loud in the privacy of their boudoirs , maybe some strange things fell out of their mouths too ; because in that world , just as in every world , the greater part of what happens is just muck and filth , sordid as any garbage can , only they are lucky enough to be able to put covers over the can . As I say , that afternoon life with Tania never had any bad effect upon me . Once in a while I 'd get too much of a skinful and I 'd have to stick my finger down my throat  --  because it 's hard to read proof when you 're not all there . It requires more concentration to detect a missing comma than to epitomize Nietzsche 's philosophy . You can be brilliant sometimes , when you 're drunk , but brilliance is out of place in the proofreading department . Dates , fractions , semicolons  --  these are the things that count . And these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mind is all ablaze . Now and then I made some bad blunders , and if it were n't that I had learned how to kiss the boss 's ass , I would have been fired , that 's certain . I even got a letter one day from the big mogul upstairs , a guy I never even met , so high up he was , and between a few sarcastic phrases about my more than ordinary intelligence , he hinted pretty plainly that I 'd better learn my place and toe the mark or there 'd be what 's what to pay . Frankly , that scared the shit out of me . After that I never used a polysyllabic word in conversation ; in fact , I hardlyp176ever opened my trap all night . I played the high-grade moron , which is what they wanted of us . Now and then , to sort of flatter the boss , I 'd go up to him and ask politely what such and such a word might mean . He liked that . He was a sort of dictionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer he guzzled during the break  --  and he made his own private breaks too , seeing as how he was running the show  --  you could never trip him up on a date or a definition . He was born to the job . My only regret was that I knew too much . It leaked out now and then , despite all the precautions I took . If I happened to come to work with a book under my arm this boss of ours would notice it , and if it were a good book it made him venomous . But I never did anything intentionally to displease him ; I liked the job too well to put a noose around my neck . Just the same it 's hard to talk to a man when you have nothing in common with him ; you betray yourself , even if you use only monosyllabic words . He knew goddamnwell , the boss , that I did n't take the least bit of interestin his yarns ; and yet , explain it how you will , it gave him pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of dates and historical events . It was his way of taking revenge , I suppose . The result was that I developed a bit of a neurosis . As soon as I hit the air I became extravagant . It would n't matter what the subject of conversation happened to be , as we started back to Montparnasse in the early morning , I 'd soon turn the fire hose on it , squelch it , in order to trot out my perverted dreams . I liked best talking about those things which none of us knew anything about . I had cultivateda mild sort of insanity , echolalia , I think it 's called . All the tag ends of a night 's proofing danced on the tip of my tongue . Dalmatia  --  I had held copy on an ad for that beautiful jeweled resort . All right , Dalmatia . Youp177take a train and in the morning your pores are perspiring and the grapes are bursting their skins . I could reel it off about Dalmatia from the grand boulevard to Cardinal Mazarin 's palace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even know where it is on the map , and I do n't want to know ever , but at three in the morning with all that lead in your veins and your clothes saturated with sweat and patchouli and the clink of bracelets passing through the wringer and those beer yarns that I was braced for , little things like geography , costume , speech , architecture do n't mean a goddamnthing . Dalmatia belongs to a certain hour of the night when those high gongs are snuffed out and the court of the Louvre seems so wonderfully ridiculous that you feel like weeping for no reason at all , just because it 's so beautifully silent , so empty , so totally unlike the front page and the guys upstairs rolling the dice . With that little piece of Dalmatia resting on my throbbing nerves like a cold knife blade I could experience the most wonderful sensations of voyage . And the funny thing is again that I could travel all around the globe but America would never enter my mind ; it was even further lost than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some mysterious attachment , whereas with America I felt nothing at all . Now and then , it 's true , I did think of Mona , not as of a person in a definite aura of time and space , but separately , detached , as though she had blown up into a great cloudlike form that blotted out the past . I could n't allow myself to think about her very long ; if I had I would have jumped off the bridge . It 's strange . I had become so reconciled to this life without her , and yet if I thought about her only for a minute it was enough to pierce the bone and marrow of my contentment and shove me back again into the agonizing gutter of my wretched past . For seven years I went about , day and night , with only one thing on my mind  --  her . Were there a Christian so faithful to his God as I was to her we would all be Jesus Christs today . Day and night I thought of her , even when I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midst of things , sometimes when I feel that I am absolutely free of it all , suddenly , in rounding a corner perhaps , there will bob up a little square , a few trees and a bench , a deserted spot where we stood and had it out , where we drove each other crazy with bitter , jealous scenes . Always some deserted spot , like the Place de 1'Estrapade , for example , or those dingy , mournful streets off the Mosque or along that open tomb of an Avenue do Bretcuil which at ten o'clock in the evening is so silent , so dead , that it makes one think of murder or suicide , anything that might create a vestige of human drama . When I realize that she is gone , perhaps gone forever , a great void opens up and I feel that I am falling , falling , falling into deep , black space . And this is worse than tears , deeper than regret or pain or sorrow ; it is the abyss into which Satan was plunged . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of human voice or human touch of hand . I low many thousand times , in walking through the streets at night , have I wondered if the day would ever come again when she would be at my side : all those yearninglooks I bestowed on the buildings and statues , I had looked at them so hungrily , so desperately , that by now my thoughts must have become a part of the very buildingsand statues , they must be saturated with my anguish . I could not help but reflect also that when we had walked side by side through these mournful , dingy streets now so saturated with my dream and longing , she had observed nothing , felt nothing : they were like any other streets to her , a little more sordid perhaps , and that is all . Shep179would n't remember that at a certain corner I had stopped to pick up her hairpin , or that , when I bent down to tie her laces , I remarked the spot on which her foot had rested and that it would remain there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole Latin civilizationwiped out forever and ever . Walking down the Rue Lhomond one night in a fit of unusual anguish and desolation , certain things were revealed to me with poignant clarity . Whether it was that I had so often walked this street in bitterness and despair or whether it was the remembrance of a phrase which she had dropped one night as we stood at the Place LucienHerrI do not know . " Why do n't you show me that Paris , " she said , " that you have written about ? " One thing I know , that at the recollection of these words I suddenly realized the impossibility of ever revealing to her that Paris which I had gotten to know , the Paris whose arrondissements are undefined , a Paris that has never existedexcept by virtue of my loneliness , my hunger for her . Such a huge Paris ! It would take a lifetime to explore it again . This Paris , to which I alone had the key , hardly lends itself to a tour , even with the best of intentions ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has to be experienced each day in a thousand different forms of torture , a Paris that grows inside you like a cancer , and grows and grows until you are eaten away by it . Stumbling down the Rue Mouffetard , with these reflectionsstirring in my brain , I recalled another strange item out of the past , out of that guidebook whose leaves she had asked me to turn but which , because the covers were so heavy , I then found impossible to pry open . For no reason at all  --  because at the moment my thoughts were occupied with Salavin in whose sacred precincts I was now meandering  --  for no reason at all , I say , there came to mind the recollection of a day when , inspired by the plaque which I passed day in and day out , I impusively entered the Pension Orfila and asked to see the room Strindberg had occupied . Up to that time nothing very terrible had befallen me , though I had already lost all my worldly possessions and had known what it was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police . Up to then I had not found a single friend in Paris , a circumstance which was not so much depressing as bewildering , for wherever I have roamed in this world the easiest thing for me to discover has been a friend . But in reality , nothingvery terrible had happened to me yet . One can live without friends , as one can live without love , or even without money , that supposed sine qua non . One can live in Paris  --  I discovered that !  --  on just grief and anguish . A bitter nourishment  --  perhaps the best there is for certain people . At any rate , I had not yet come to the end of my rope . I was only flirting with disaster . I had time and sentimentenough to spare to peep into other people 's lives , to daily with the dead stuff of romance which , however morbid it may be , when it is wrapped between the covers of a book , seems deliciously remote and anonymous . As I was leaving the place I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though I were saying to myself " Not yet , the Pension Orfila ! " Since then , of course , I have learned what every madmanin Paris discovers sooner or later ; that there are no ready-made infernos for the tormented . It seems to me I understand a little better now why she took such huge delight in reading Strindberg . I can see her looking up from her book after reading a delicious passage , and , with tears of laughter in her eyes , saying to me : " You 're just as mad as he was . . . you want to be punished ! " What a delight that must be to the sadist whenp181she discovers her own proper masochist ! When she bites herself , as it were , to test the sharpness of her teeth . In those days , when I first knew her , she was saturated with Strindberg . That wild carnival of maggots which he reveled in , that eternal duel of the sexes , that spiderish ferocity which had endeared him to the sodden oafs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We came together in a dance of death and so quickly was I sucked down into the vortex that when I came to the surfaceagain I could not recognize the world . When I found myself loose the music had ceased ; the carnival was over and I had been picked clean ... . After leaving the Pension Orfila that afternoon I went to the library and there , after bathing in the Ganges and pondering over the signs of the zodiac , I began to reflect on the meaning of that inferno which Strindberg had so mercilessly depicted . And , as I ruminated , it began to grow clear to me , the mystery of his pilgrimage , the flight which the poet makes over the face of the earth and then , as if he had been ordained to re-enact a lost drama , the heroic descent to the very bowels of the earth , the dark and fearsome sojourn in the belly of the whale , the bloody struggle to liberate himself , to emerge clean of the past , a bright , gory sun god @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystery to me any longer why he and others ( Dante , Rabelais , Van Gogh , etc. , etc. ) had made their pilgrimage to Paris . I understood then why it is that Paris attracts the tortured , the hallucinated , the great maniacs of love . I understood why it is that here , at the very hub of the wheel , one can embrace the most fantastic , the most impossibletheories , without finding them in the least strange ; it is here that one reads again the books of his youth and the enigmas take on new meanings , one for every white hair . One walks the streets knowing that hep182is mad , possessed , because it is only too obvious that these cold , indifferent faces are the visages of one 's keepers . Here all boundaries fade away and the world reveals itself for the mad slaughterhouse that it is . The treadmill stretches away to infinitude , the hatches are closed down tight , logic runs rampant , with bloody cleaver flashing . The air is chill and stagnant , the language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save death . A blind alley at the end of which is a scaffold . An eternal city , Paris ! More eternal than Rome , more splendorous than Nineveh . The very navel of the world to which , like a blind and faltering idiot , one crawls back on hands and knees . And like a cork that has drifted to the dead center of the ocean , one floats here in the scum and wrack of the seas , listless , hopeless , heedless even of a passing Columbus . The cradles of civilization are the putrid sinks of the world , the charnel house to which the stinking wombs confide their bloody packages of flesh and bone . The streets were my refuge . And no man can understand the glamor of the streets until he is obliged to take refuge in them , until he has become a straw that is tossed here and there by every zephyr that blows . One passes along a street on a wintry day and , seeing a dog for sale , one is moved to tears . While across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hut that calls itself " Hotel du " hombcau des Lapins . " That makes one laugh , laugh fit to die . Until one notices that there are hotels everywhere , for rabbits , dogs , lice , emperors , cabinet ministers , pawnbrokers , horse knackers , and so on . And almost every other one is an " Hotel de 1'Avenir . " Which makes one more hysterical still . So many hotels of the future ! No hotels in the past participle , no subjunctive modes , no conjunctivitis . Everything is hoary , grisly ,  |p183bristling  with merriment , swollen with the future , like a gumboil . Drunk with this lecherous eczema of the future , I stagger over to the Place Violet , the colors all mauve and slate , the doorways so low that only dwarfs and goblins could hobble in ; over the dull cranium of Zola the chimneys are belching pure coke , while the Madonna of Sandwiches listens with cabbage ears to the bubbling of the gas tanks , those beautiful bloated toads which squat by the roadside . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day a woman addressed her puppy in the apocalyptic language of the slaughterhouse , and the little bitch , she understood what this greasy slut of a midwife was saying . How that depressed me ! More even than the sight of those whimpering curs that were being sold on the Rue Brancion , because it was not the dogs which filled me so with pity , but the huge iron railing , those rusty spikes which seemed to stand between me and my rightful life . In the pleasant little lane near the Abattoirde Vaugirard ( Abattoir Hippophagique ) , which is called the Rue des Perichaux , I had noticed here and there signs of blood . Just as Strindberg in his madness had recognizedomens and portents in the very flagging of the Pension Orfila , so , as I wandered aimlessly through this muddy lane bespattered with blood , fragments of the past detached themselves and floated listlessly before my eyes , taunting me with the direst forebodings . I saw my own blood being spilled , the muddy road stained with it , as far back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One is ejected into the world like a dirty little mummy ; the roads are slippery with blood and no one knows why it should be so . Each one is traveling his own way and , though the earth be rotting with good things , there is no time to pluck the fruits ; the procession scrambles toward the exit sign , and such a panic is there , such a sweat to escape , that the weak and the helpless are trampled into the mud and their cries are unheard . My world of human beings had perished ; I was utterly alone in the world and for friends I had the streets , and the streets spoke to me in that sad , bitter language compoundedof human misery , yearning , regret , failure , wasted effort . Passing under the viaduct along the Rue Broca , one night after I had been informed that Mona was ill and starving , I suddenly recalled that it was here in the squalor and gloom of this sunken street , terrorized perhaps by a premonition of the future , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begged me to promise that I would never leave her , never , no matter what happened . And , only a few days later , I stood on the platform of the ( arc St. Lazare and I watched the train pull out , the train that was bearing her away ; she was leaning out of the window , just as she had leaned out of the window when I left her in New York , and there was that same , sad , inscrutable smile on her face , that last-minute look which is intended to convey so much , but which is only a mask that is twisted by a vacant smile . Only a few days before , she had clung to me desperately and then something happened , something which is not even clear to me now , and of her own volition she boarded the train and she was looking at me again with that sad , enigmatic smile which baffles me , which is unjust , unnatural , which I distrust with all my soul . And now it is I , standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her , who cling to her desperately and there is that same inexplicable smile on my lips , the mask that I have clamped down over my grief . I can stand here and smile vacantly , and no matter how fervid my prayers , no matter how desperate my longing , there is an ocean between us ; there she will stayp185and starve , and here I shall walk from one street to the next , the hot tears scalding my face . It is that sort of cruelty which is embedded in the streets ; it is that which stares out from the walls and terrifiesus when suddenly we respond to a nameless fear , when suddenly our souls are invaded by a sickening panic . It is that which gives the lampposts their ghoulish twists , which makes them beckon to us and lure us to their stranglinggrip ; it is that which makes certain houses appear like the guardians of secret crimes and their blind windows like the empty sockets of eyes that have seen too much . It is that sort of thing , written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flee when overhead I suddenlysee inscribed " Impasse Satan . " That which makes me shudder when at the very entrance to the Mosque I observe that it is written : " Mondays and Thursdays tuberculosis ; Wednesdays and Fridays syphilis . " In every Metro station there are grinning skulls that greet you with " De f endez-vous contre la syphilis ! " Wherever there arewalls , there are posters with bright venomous crabs heralding the approach of cancer . No matter where you go , no matter what you touch , there is cancer and syphilis . It is written in the sky ; it flames and dances , like an evil portent . It has eaten into our souls and we are nothing but a dead thing like the moon.  |p186I  think it was the Fourth of July when they took the chair from under my ass again . Not a word of warning . One of the big muck-a-mucks from the other side of the water had decided to make economies ; cutting down on proofreaders and helpless little dactylos enabled him to pay the expenses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Ritz . After paying what little debts I had accumulated among the linotype operatorsand a goodwill token at the bistro across the way , in order to preserve my credit , there was scarcely anythingleft out of my final pay . I had to notify the patron of the hotel that I would be leaving ; I did n't tell him why because he 'd have worried about his measly two hundred francs . " What 'll you do if you lose your job ? " That was the phrase that rang in my ears continually . Ca y est maintenant ! Ausgespielt ! Nothing to do but to get down into the street again , walk , hang around , sit on benches , kill time . By now , of course , my face was familiar in Montparnasse ; for a while I could pretend that I was still working on the paper . That would make it a little easier to bum a breakfast or a dinner . It was summertime and the touristswere pouring in . I had schemes up my sleeve formulcting them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wouldn'tstarve , that 's one thing . If I should do nothing else but concentrate on food that would prevent me from falling to pieces . For a week or two I could still go to Monsieur Paul 's and have a square meal every evening ; he wouldn'tp187know whether I was working or not . The main thing is to eat . Trust to Providence for the rest ! Naturally , I kept my ears open for anything that sounded like a little dough . And I cultivated a whole new set of acquaintances  --  bores whom I had sedulously avoided heretofore , drunks whom I loathed , artists who had a little money , Guggenheim-prize men , etc . It 's not hard to make friends when you squat on a terrasse twelve hours a day . You get to know every sot in Montparnasse . They cling to you like lice , even if you have nothing to offer them but your ears . Now that I had lost my job Carl and Van Norden had a new phrase for me : " What if your wife should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two mouths to feed , instead of one . I 'd have a companion in misery . And , if she had n't lost her good looks , I 'd probably do better in double harnessthan alone : the world never permits a good-looking woman to starve . Tania I could n't depend on to do much for me ; she was sending money to Sylvester . I had thought at first that she might let me share her room , but she was afraid of compromising herself ; besides , she had to be nice to her boss . The first people to turn to when you 're down and out are the Jews . I had three of them on my hands almost at once . Sympathetic souls . One of them was a retired fur merchant who had an itch to see his name in the papers ; he proposed that I write a series of articles under his name for a Jewish daily in New York . I had to scout around the Dome and the Coupole searching for prominentJews . The first man I picked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word of English . I had to write about the theory of shock from the diagrams he left on the paper napkins ; I had to describe the movements of the astral bodies and demolish the **25;2116;TOOLONG at the same time . All for twenty-five francs . When I saw my articles in the newspaper I could n't read them ; but they looked impressive , just the same , especially with the pseudonym of the fur merchant attached . I did a lot of pseudonymous writing during this period . When the big new whorehouse opened up on the BoulevardEdgar-Quinet , I got a little rake-off , for writing the pamphlets . That is to say , a bottle of champagne and a free fuck in one of the Egyptian rooms . If I succeeded in bringing a client I was to get my commission , just like Kepi got his in the old days . One night I brought Van Norden ; he was going to let me earn a little money by enjoying himself upstairs . But when the madame learned that he was a newspaperman she would n't hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of champagne again and a free fuck . I got nothing out of it . As a matter of fact , I had to write the story for him because he could n't think how to get round the subject without mentioning the kind of place it was . One thing after another like that . I was getting fucked good and proper . The worst job of all was a thesis I undertook to write for a deaf and dumb psychologist . A treatise on the care of crippled children . My head was full of diseases and braces and workbenches and fresh air theories ; it took about six weeks off and on , and then , to rub it in , I had to proofread the goddamned thing . It was in French , such a French as I 've never in my life seen or heard . But it brought me in a good breakfast every day , an American breakfast , with orange juice , oatmeal , cream , coffee , now and then ham and eggs for a change . It was the only period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decent breakfast , thanks to the crippled children of Rockaway Beach , the East Side , and all the coves and inlets bordering on these sore points.  |p189Then  one day I fell in with a photographer ; he was making a collection of the slimy joints of Paris for some degenerate in Munich . He wanted to know if I would pose for him with my pants down , and in other ways . I thought of those skinny little runts , who look like bellhopsand messenger boys , that one sees on pornographic post cards in little bookshop windows occasionally , the mysterious phantoms who inhabit the Rue de la Lune and other malodorous quarters of the city . I did n't like very much the idea of advertising my physiog in the company of these elite . But , since I was assured that the photographswere for a strictly private collection , and since it was destined for Munich , I gave my consent . When you 're not in your home town you can permit yourself little liberties , particularly for such a worthy motive as earning your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so squeamish , come to think of it , even in New York . There were nights when I was so damned desperate , back there , that I had to go out right in my own neighborhood and panhandle . We did n't go to the show places familiar to the tourists , but to the little joints where the atmosphere was more congenial , where we could play a game of cards in the afternoon before getting down to work . He was a good companion , the photographer . He knew the city inside out , the walls particularly ; he talked to me about Goethe often , and the days of the Hohenstaufen , and the massacreof the Jews during the reign of the Black Death . Interesting subjects , and always related in some obscure way to the things he was doing . He had ideas for scenarios too , astounding ideas , but nobody had the courage to executethem . The sight of a horse , split open like a saloon door , would inspire him to talk of Dante or Leonardo da Vinci or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump into a cab and rush me to the TrocaderoMuseum , in order to point out a skull or a mummy that had fascinated him . We explored the 5th , the 13th , the 19th and the 20th arrondissements thoroughly . Our favorite resting places were lugubrious little spots such as the Place Nationale , Place des Peupliers , Place de la Contrescarpe , Place Paul-Verlaine . Many of these places were already familiar to mc , but all of them I now saw in a differentlight owing to the rare flavor of his conversation . If today I should happen to stroll down the Rue du Chateau-des-Rcnticrs , for example , inhaling the fetid stench of the hospital beds with which the 13th arrondissementreeks , my nostrils would undoubtedly expand with pleasure , because , compounded with that odor of stale piss and formaldehyde , there would be the odors of our imaginative voyages through the charnel house of Europe which the Black Death had created . Through him I got to know a spiritual-minded individualnamed Kruger , who was a sculptor and painter . Kruger took a shine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible to get away from him once he discovered that I was willing to listen to his " esoteric " ideas . There are people in this world for whom the word " esoteric " seems to act as a divine ichor . Like " settled " for Herr Peeperkornof the Magic Mountain . Kruger was one of those saints who have gone wrong , a masochist , an anal type whose law is scrupulousness , rectitude and conscientiousness , who on an off day would knock a man 's teeth down his throat without a qualm . He seemed to think I was ripe to move on to another plane , " a higher plane , " as he put it . I was ready to move on to any plane he designated , providedthat one did n't eat less or drink less . He chewed my head off about the " thrcadsoul , " the " causal body , " " ablation , " the Upanishads , Plotinus , Krishnamurti , " thep191Karmic vestiture of the soul , " " the nirvanic consciousness , " all that flapdoodle which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plague . Sometimes he would go into a trance and talk about his previous incarnations , how he imagined them to be , at least . Or he would relate his dreams which , so far as I could see , were thoroughly insipid , prosaic , hardly worth even the attention of a Freudian , but , for him , there were vast esoteric marvels hidden in their depths which I had to aid him to decipher . He had turned himself inside out , like a coat whose nap is worn off . Little by little , as I gained his confidence , I wormed my way into his heart . I had him at such a point that he would come running after me , in the street , to inquire if he could lend me a few francs . He wanted to hold me together in order to survive the transition to a higher plane . I acted like a pear that is ripening on the tree . Now and then I had relapses and I would confess my need for more earthly nourishment  --  a visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew he repaired in weak momentswhen the demands of the flesh had become too vehement . As a painter he was nil ; as a sculptor less than nil . He was a good housekeeper , that I 'll say for him . And an economical one to boot . Nothing went to waste , not even the paper that the meat was wrapped in . Friday nights he threw open his studio to his fellow artists ; there was alwaysplenty to drink and good sandwiches , and if by chance there was anything left over I would come round the next day to polish it off . Back of the Bal Bullier was another studio I got into the habit of frequenting  --  the studio of Mark Swift . If he was not a genius he was certainly an eccentric , this caustic Irishman . He had for a model a Jewess whom he hadp192been living with for years ; he was now tired of her and was searching for a pretext to get rid of her . But as he had eaten up the dowry which she had originally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to disembarrass himself of her without making restitution . The simplest thing was to so antagonize her that she would choose starvation rather than support his cruelties . She was rather a fine person , his mistress ; the worst that one could say against her was that she had lost her shape , and her ability to support him any longer . She was a painter herself and , among those who professed to know , it was said that she had far more talent than he . But no matter how miserable he made life for her she was just ; she would never allow anyone to say that he was not a great painter . It was because he really has genius , she said , that he was such a rotten individual . One never saw her canvases on the wall  --  only his . Her things were stuck away in the kitchen . Once it happened , in my presence , that someone insisted on seeing her work . The result was painful . " You see this figure , " said Swift , pointing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man standing in the doorway there is just about to go out for a leak . He wo n't be able to find his way back because his head is on wrong . . . . Now take that nude over there . . . . It was all right until she started to paint the cunt . I do n't know what she was thinking about , but she made it so big that her brush slipped and she could n't get it out again . " By way of showing us what a nude ought to be like he hauls out a huge canvas which he had recently completed . It was a picture of her , a splendid piece of vengeanceinspired by a guilty conscience . The work of a madman  --  vicious , petty , malign , brilliant . You had the feeling that he had spied on her through the keyhole , that he had caught her in an off moment , when she was pick/ing her nose absent-mindedly , or scratching her ass . She sat there on the horsehair sofa , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it might as well have been the anterior lobe of the pineal gland . Back of her ran the zigzag stairs leading to the balcony ; they were covered with a bilious-green carpet , such a green as could only emanate from a universe that had been pooped out . The most prominent thing was her buttocks , which were lopsided and full of scabs ; she seemed to have slightly raised her ass from the sofa , as if to let a loud fart . Her face he had idealized : it looked sweet and virginal , pure as a cough drop . But her bosom was distended , swollenwith sewer gas ; she seemed to be swimming in a menstrualsea , an enlarged fetus with the dull , syrupy look of an angel . Nevertheless one could n't help but like him . He was an indefatigable worker , a man who had n't a single thought in his head but paint . And cunning as a lynx withal . It was he who put it into my head to cultivate the friendship of Fillmore , a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the little group that surrounded Kruger and Swift . " Let him help you , " he said . " He does n't know what to do with his money . " When one spends what he has on himself , when one has a thoroughly good time with his own money , people are apt to say " he does n't know what to do with his money . " For my part , I do n't see any better use to which one can put money . About such individuals one ca n't say that they 're generous or stingy . They put money into circulation  --  that 's the principal thing . Fillmore knew that his days in France were limited ; he was determined to enjoy them . And as one always enjoys himself better in the company of a friend it was only natural that he should turn to one like myself , who had plenty of time on his hands , for that companionship which he needed . People said he was a bore , and so he was , I suppose , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with worse things than being bored . After all , despite the fact that he talked incessantly , and usually about himself or the authors whom he admired slavishly  --  such birds as AnatoleFrance and Joseph Conrad  --  he nevertheless made my nights interesting in other ways . He liked to dance , he liked good wines , and he liked women . That he liked Byron also , and Victor I lugo , one could forgive ; he was only a few years out of college and he had plenty of time ahead of him to be cured of such tastes . What he had that I liked was a sense of adventure . We got even better acquainted , more intimate , I might say , due to a peculiar incident that occurred during my brief sojourn with Kruger . It happened just after the arrival of Collins , a sailor whom Fillmore had got to know on the way over from America . The three of us used to meet regularly on the terrasse of the Rotonde before goingto dinner . It was always Pernod , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base , as it were , for the wine and beer and fines , etc. , which had to be guzzled afterward . All ( luring Collins 's stay in Paris I lived like a duke ; nothing but fowl and good vintages and desserts that I had n't even heard of before . A month of this regimenand I should have been obliged to go to Baden-Baden or Vichy or Aix-les-Bains . Meanwhile Kruger was puttingme up at his studio . I was getting to be a nuisance because I never showed up before three a.m. and it was difficult to rout me out of bed before noon . Overtly Kruger never uttered a word of reproach but his manner indicated plainly enough that I was becoming a bum . One day I was taken ill . The rich diet was taking effect upon me . I do n't know what ailed me , but I could n't getp195out of bed . I had lost all my stamina , and with it whatever courage I possessed . Kruger had to look after me , had to make broths for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him , more particularly because he was just on the verge of giving an important exhibition at his studio , a private showing to some wealthy connoisseurs from whom he was expecting aid . The cot on which I lay was in the studio ; there was no other room to put me in . The morning of the day he was to give his exhibition , Kruger awoke thoroughly disgruntled . If I had been able to stand on my feet I know he would have given me a clout in the jaw and kicked me out . But I was prostrate , and weak as a cat . He tried to coax me out of bed , with the idea of locking me up in the kitchen upon the arrival of his visitors . I realized that I was making a mess of it for him . People ca n't look at pictures and statues with enthusiasmwhen a man is dying before their eyes . Kruger honestly thought I was dying . So did I. That 's why , despitemy feelings of guilt , I could n't muster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipped to the American Hospital . I wanted to die there , comfortably , right in the studio ; I did n't want to be urged to get up and find a better place to die in . I did n't care where I died , really , so long as it was n't necessary to get up . When he heard me talk this way Kruger became alarmed . Worse than having a sick man in his studio should the visitors arrive , was to have a dead man . That would completely ruin his prospects , slim as they were . He did n't put it that wav to me , of course , but I could see from his agitation that that was what worried him . And that made me stubborn . I refused to let him call the hospital . I refused to let him call a doctor . I refused everything.  | He got so angry with me finally that , despite my protestations , he began to dress me . I was too weak to resist . All I could do was to murmur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was warm outdoors I was shivering like a dog . After he had completely dressed me he flung an overcoat over me and slipped outside to telephone . " I wo n't go ! I wo n't go ! " I kept saying but he simply slammed the door on me . He came back in a few minutes and , without addressing a word to me , busied himself about the studio . Last minute preparations . In a little while there was a knock on the door . It was Fillmore . Collins was waiting downstairs , he informed me . The two of them , Fillmore and Kruger , slipped their arms under me and hoisted me to my feet . As they dragged me to the elevator Kruger softened up . " It 's for your own good , " he said . " And besides , it would n't be fair to mc . You know what a struggle I 've had all these years . You ought to think about me too . " He was actually on the point of tears . Wretched and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . He was considerably older than I , and even though he was a rotten painter , a rotten artist all the way through , he deserved a break  --  at least once in a lifetime . " I do n't hold it against you , " I muttered . " I understand how it is . " " You know I always liked you , " he responded . " When you get better you can come back here again ... you can stay as long as you like . " " Sure , I know . . . . I 'm not going to croak yet , " I managed to get out . Somehow , when I saw Collins down below my spirits revived . If ever any one seemed to be thoroughly alive , healthy , joyous , magnanimous , it was he . He picked mep197up as if I were a doll and laid me out on the seat of the cab  --  gently too , which I appreciated after the way Kruger had manhandled me . When we drove up to the hotel  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of a discussion with the proprietor , during which I lay stretched out on the sofa in the bureau . I could hear Collins saying to the patron that it was nothing . . . just a little breakdown . . . be all right in a few days . I saw him put a crisp bill in the man 's hands and then , turning swiftly and lithely , he came back to where I was and said : " Come on , buck up ! Do n't let him think you 're croaking . " And with that , he yanked me to my feet and , bracing me with one arm , escorted me to the elevator . Do n't let him think you 're croaking ! Obviously it was bad taste to die on people 's hands . One should die in the bosom of his family , in private , as it were . His words were encouraging . I began to see it all as a bad joke . Upstairs , with the door closed , they undressed me and put me between the sheets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " said Collins warmly . " You 'll put me in a hole .... Besides , what the hell 's the matter with you ? Ca n't stand good living ? Keep your chin up ! You 'll be eating a porterhouse steak in a day or two . You think you 're ill ! Wait , by Jesus until you get a dose of syphilis ! That 's something to make you worry .... " And he began to relate , in a humorous way , his trip down the Yangtze Kiang , with hair falling out and teeth rotting away . In the feeble state that I was in , the yarn that he spun had an extraordinary soothing effectupon me . It took me completely out of myself . He had guts , this guy . Perhaps he put it on a bit thick , for my benefit , but I was n't listening to him critically at the moment . I was all ears and eyes . I saw the dirty yellow mouth of the river , the lights going up at Hankow , the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gorges and the rapids flaming with the sulfurous breath of the dragon . What a story ! The coolies swarming around the boat each day , dredging for the garbage that was flung overboard , Tom Slattery rising up on his deathbedto take a last look at the lights of Hankow , the beautifulEurasian who lay in a dark room and filled his veins with poison , the monotony of blue jackets and yellow faces , millions and millions of them hollowed out by famine , ravaged by disease , subsisting on rats and dogs and roots , chewing the grass off the earth , devouring their own children . It was hard to imagine that this man 's body had once been a mass of sores , that he had been shunned like a leper ; his voice was so quiet and gentle , it was as though his spirit had been cleansed by all the suffering he had endured . As he reached for his drink his face grew more and more soft and his words actually seemed to caress me . And all the while China hanging over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crumbling to dust like a huge dinosaur , yet preserving to the very end the glamor , the enchantment , the mystery , the cruelty of her hoary legends . I could no longer follow his story ; my mind had slipped back to a Fourth of July when I bought my first package of firecrackers and with it the long pieces of punk which break so easily , the punk that you blow on to get a good red glow , the punk whose smell sticks to your fingers for days and makes you dream of strange things . The Fourth of July the streets are littered with bright red paper stamped with black and gold figures and everywhere there are tiny firecrackers which have the most curious intestines ; packages and packages of them , all strung together by their thin , flat , little gutstrings , the color of humanbrains . All day long there is the smell of powder andp199punk and the gold dust from the bright red wrappers sticks to your fingers . One never thinks of China , but it is there all the time on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itchy ; and long afterward , when you have forgottenalmost what a firecracker smells like , you wake up one day with gold leaf choking you and the broken pieces of punk waft back their pungent odor and the bright red wrappers give you a nostalgia for a people and a soil you have never known , but which is in your blood , mysteriously there in your blood , like the sense of time or space , a fugitive , constant value to which you turn more and more as you get old , which you try to seize with your mind , but ineffectually , because in everything Chinese there is wisdom and mystery and you can never grasp it with two hands or with your mind but you must let it rub off , let it stick to your fingers , let it slowly infiltrateyour veins . A few weeks later , upon receipt of a pressing invitation from Collins who had returned to Le Havre , Fillmore and I boarded the train one morning , prepared to spend the weekend with him . It was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were in fine fettle , drinking Anjou all the way to the coast . Collins had given us the address of a bar where we were to meet ; it was a place called Jimmie 's Bar , which everyone in Le Havre was supposed to know . We got into an open barouche at the station and started on a brisk trot for the rendezvous ; there was still a half bottle of Anjou left which we polished off as we rode along . Le Havre looked gay , sunny ; the air was bracing , with that strong salty tang which almost made me homesickfor New York . There were masts and hulls cropping up everywhere , bright bits of bunting , big open squares and high-ceilinged cafes such as one only sees in the provinces . A fine impression immediately ; the city was welcomingus with open arms . Before we ever reached the bar we saw Collins coming down the street on a trot , heading for the station , no doubt , and a little late as usual . Fillmore immediately suggested a Pernod ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing and spitting , drunk already from the sunshineand the salt sea air . Collins seemed undecided about the Pernod at first . Ile had a little dose of clap , he informedus . Nothing very serious  --  " a strain " most likely . He showed us a bottle he had in his pocket  --  " Venetienne " it was called , if I remember rightly . The sailors ' remedy for clap . We stopped off at a restaurant to have a little snack before repairing to Jimmie 's place . It was a huge tavern with big , smoky rafters and tables creaking with food . We drank copiously of the wines that Collins recommended . Then we sat down on a terrasse and had coffee and liqueurs . Collins was talking about the Baron de Charlus , a man after his own heart , he said . For almost a year now he had been staying at Le Havre , going through the money that he had accumulated during his bootleggingdays . His tastes were simple  --  food , drink , women and books . And a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still talking about the Baron de Charlus when we arrived at Jimmie 's Bar . It was late in the afternoon and the place was just beginning to fill up . Jimmie was there , his face red as a beet , and beside him was his spouse , a fine buxom Frenchwoman with glittering eyes . We were given a marvelous reception all around . There were Pernods in front of us again , the gramophone was shrieking , people were jabbering away in English and French and Dutch and Norwegian and Spanish , andp201Jimmie and his wife , both of them looking very brisk and dapper , were slapping and kissing each other heartily and raising their glasses and clinking them  --  altogether such a bubble and blabber of merriment that you felt like pulling off your clothes and doing a war dance . The women at the bar had gathered around like flies . If we were friends of Collins that meant we were rich . It did n't matter that we had come in our old clothes ; all Anglais dressed like that . I had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , since I was the guest of honor . Nevertheless I felt somewhat embarrassed with two stunning-looking whores hanging on my arms waiting for me to order something . I decided to take the bull by the horns . You could n't tell any more which drinks were on the house and which were to be paid for . I had to be a gentleman , even if I did n't have a sou in my pocket . Yvette  --  that was Jimmie 's wife  --  was extraordinarily gracious and friendly with us . She was preparing a little spread in our honor . It would take a little while yet . We were not to get too drunk  --  she wanted us to enjoy the meal . The gramophone was going like wild and Fillmore had begun to dance with a beautiful mulatto who had on a tight velvet dress that revealed all her charms . Collins slipped over to my side and whispered a few words about the girl at my side . " The madame will invite her to dinner , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was an exwhorewho owned a beautiful home on the outskirts of the city . The mistress of a sea captain now . He was away and there was nothing to fear . " If she likes you she 'll inviteyou to stay with her , " he added . That was enough for me . I turned at once to Marcelle and began to flatter the ass off her . We stood at the corner of the bar , pretending to dance , and mauled each other ferociously . Jimmie gave me a big horse-wink and nod- ded his head approvingly . She was a lascivious bitch , this Marcelle , and pleasant at the same time . She soon got rid of the other girl , I noticed , and then we settled down for a long and intimate conversation which was interrupted unfortunately by the announcement that dinner was ready . There were about twenty of us at the table , and Marcelleand I were placed at one end opposite Jimmie and his wife . It began with the popping of champagne corks and was quickly followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I played with each other under the table . When it came my turn to stand up and deliver a few words I had to hold the napkin in front of me . It was painful and exhilarating at the same time . I had to cut the speech very short because Marcelle was tickling me in the crotch all the while . The dinner lasted until almost midnight . I was looking forward to spending the night with Marcelle in that beautifulhome up on the cliff . But it was not to be . Collins had planned to show us about and I could n't very well refuse . " Do n't worry about her , " he said . " You 'll have a bellyful of it before you leave . Tell her to wait here for you until we get back . " She was a bit peeved at this , Marcelle , but when we informed her that we had several days ahead of us she brightened up . When we got outdoors Fillmore very solemnly took us by the arm and said he had a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , what is it ? " said Collins cheerfully . " Spit it out ! " Fillmore could n't spit it out like that , all at once . He hemmed and hawed and finally he blurted out  --  " Well , when I went to the closet just a minute ago I noticed something .... "  | " Then you 've got it ! " said Collins triumphantly , and with that he flourished the bottle of " Venetienne . " " Do n't go to a doctor , " he added venomously . " They 'll bleed you to death , the greedy bastards . And do n't stop drinking either . That 's all hooey . Take this twice a day .. . shake it well before using . And nothing 's worse than worry , do you understand ? Come on now . I 'll give you a syringe and some permanganate when we get back . " And so we started out into the night , down toward the waterfront where there was the sound of music and shouts and drunken oaths , Collins talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy he had fallen in love with , and the devil 's time he had to get out of the scrape when the parents got wise to it . From that he switched back to the Baron de Charlus and then to Kurtz who had gone up the river and got lost . His favorite theme . I liked the way Collins moved against this background of literaturecontinuously ; it was like a millionaire who never stepped out of his Rolls Royce . There was no intermediaterealm for him between reality and ideas . When we entered the whorehouse on the Quai Voltaire , after he had flung himself on the divan and rung for girls and for drinks , he was still paddling up the river with Kurtz , and only when the girls had flopped on the bed beside him and stuffed his mouth with kisses did he cease his divagations . Then , as if he had suddenly realized where he was , he turned to the old mother who ran the place and gave her an eloquent spiel about his two friends who had come down from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a dozen girls in the room , all naked and all beautiful to look at , I must say . They hopped about like birds while the three of us tried to maintain a conversation with the grandmother . Finally the latter excused herself and told us to make ourselves at home . I was altogetherp204taken in by her , so sweet and amiable she was , so thoroughlygentle and maternal . And what manners ! If she had been a little younger I would have made overtures to her . Certainly you would not have thought that we were in a " den of vice , " as it is called . Anyway we stayed there an hour or so , and as I was the only one in condition to enjoy the privileges of the house , Collins and Fillmore remained downstairs chatteringwith the girls . When I returned I found the two of them stretched out on the bed ; the girls had formed a semicircle about the bed and were singing with the most angelic voices the chorus of Roses in Picardy . We were sentimentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swiftly steered us to a rough joint which was packed with drunken sailors on shore leave and there we sat awhile enjoying the homosexual rout that was in full swing . When we sallied out we had to pass through the red-light district where there were more grandmothers with shawls about their necks sitting on the doorsteps fanning themselves and nodding pleasantlyto the passers-by . All such good-looking , kindly souls , as if they were keeping guard over a nursery . Little groups of sailors came swinging along and pushed their way noisily inside the gaudy joints . Sex everywhere : it was slopping over , a neap tide that swept the props from under the city . We piddled along at the edge of the basin where everything was jumbled and tangled ; you had the impression that all these ships , these trawlers and yachts and schooners and barges , had been blown ashore by a violent storm . In the space of forty-eight hours so many things had happened that it seemed as if we had been in Le Havre a month or more . We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be back on the job . We spentp205Sunday drinking and carousing , clap or no clap . That afternoon Collins confided to us that he was thinking of returning to his ranch in Idaho ; he had n't been home for eight years and he wanted to have a look at the mountains again before making another voyage East . We were sitting in a whorehouse at the time , waiting for a girl to appear ; he had promised to slip her some cocaine . He was fed up with Le Havre , he told us . Too many vultures hanging around his neck . Besides , Jimmie 's wife had fallenin love with him and she was making things hot for him with her jealous fits . There was a scene almost every night . She had been on her good behavior since we arrived , but it would n't last , he promised us . She was particularlyjealous of a Russian girl who came to the bar now and then when she got tight . A troublemaker . On top of it all he was desperately in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first day . " A boy can break your heart , " he said . " He 's so damned beautiful ! And so cruel ! " We had to laugh at this . It sounded preposterous . But Collins was in earnest . Around midnight Sunday Fillmore and I retired ; we had been given a room upstairs over the bar . It was sultry as the devil , not a breath of air stirring . Through the open windows we could hear them shouting downstairs and the gramophone going continually . All of a sudden a storm broke  --  a regular cloudburst . And between the thunderclaps and the squalls that lashed the windowpanesthere came to our ears the sound of another storm raging downstairs at the bar . It sounded frightfully close and sinister ; the women were shrieking at the tops of their lungs , bottles were crashing , tables were upset and there was that familiar , nauseating thud that the human body makes when it crashes to the floor . About six o'clock Collins stuck his head in the door.  | His face was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had a big grin on his face . " Just as I told you , " he said . " She broke loose last night . Suppose you heard the racket ? " We got dressed quickly and went downstairs to say good-bye to Jimmie . The place was completely demolished , not a bottle left standing , not a chair that was n't broken . The mirror and the show window were smashed to bits . Jimmie was malting himself an eggnog . On the way to the station we pieced the story together . The Russian girl had dropped in after we toddled off to bed and Yvette had insulted her promptly , without even waiting for an excuse . They had commenced to pull each other 's hair and in the midst of it a big Swede had stepped in and given the Russian girl a sound slap in the jaw  --  to bring her to her senses . That started the fireworks . Collins wanted to know what right this big stiff had to interfere in a private quarrel . He got a poke in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him flying to the other end of the bar . " Serves you right ! " screamed Yvette , taking advantage of the occasion to swing a bottle at the Russian girl 's head . And at that moment the thunderstorm broke loose . For a while there was a regular pandemonium , the women all hysterical and hungry to seize the opportunity to pay off private grudges . Nothing like a nice barroom brawl . . . so easy to stick a knife in a man 's back or club him with a bottle when he 's lying under a table . The poor Swede found himself in a hornet 's nest ; everyone in the place hated him , particularly his shipmates . They wanted to see him done in . And so they locked the door and pushingthe tables aside they made a little space in front of the bar where the two of them could have it out . And they had it out ! They had to carry the poor devil to the hospitalwhen it was over . Collins had come off rather lucky  --  nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of joint , a bloody nose and a black eye . Just a few scratches , as he put it . But if he ever signed up with that Swede he was going to murder him . It was n't finished yet . He promised us that . And that was n't the end of the fracas either . After that Yvette had to go out and get liquored up at another bar . She had been insulted and she was going to put an end to things . And so she hires a taxi and orders the driver to ride out to the edge of the cliff overlooking the water . She was going to kill herself , that 's what she was going to do . But then she was so drunk that when she tumbled out of the cab she began to weep and before any one could stop her she had begun to peel her clothes off . The driver brought her home that way , half-naked , and when Jimmiesaw the condition she was in he was so furious with her that he took his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she liked it , the bitch that she was . " Do it some more ! " she begged , down on her knees as she was and clutching him around the legs with her two arms . But Jimmie had enough of it . " You 're a dirty old sow ! " he said and with his foot he gave her a shove in the guts that took the wind out of her  --  and a bit of her sexy nonsense too . It was high time we were leaving . The city looked differentin the early morning light . The last thing we talked about , as we stood there waiting for the train to pull out , was Idaho . The three of us were Americans . We came from different places , each of us , but we had something in common  --  a whole lot , I might say . We were getting sentimental , as Americans do when it comes time to part . We were getting quite foolish about the cows and sheep and the big open spaces where men are men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along instead of the train we 'd have hopped aboard and said good-bye to it all . But Collins was never to see America again , as I learned later ; and Fillmore . . . well , Fillmore had to take his punishmenttoo , in a way that none of us could have suspected then . It 's best to keep America just like that , always in the background , a sort of picture post card which you look at in a weak moment . Like that , you imagine it 's always there waiting for you , unchanged , unspoiled , a big patrioticopen space with cows and sheep and tenderhearted men ready to bugger everything in sight , man , woman or beast . It does n't exist , America . It 's a name you give to an abstract idea ... .  |p209Paris  is like a whore . From a distance she seems ravishing , you ca n't wait until you have her in your arms . And five minutes later you feel empty , disgusted with yourself . You feel tricked . I returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ francs , which Collins had shoved in my pocket just as I was boarding the train . It was enough to pay for a room and at least a week 's good rations . It was more than I had had in my hands at one time for several years . I felt elated , as though perhaps a new life was opening before me . I wanted to conserve it too , so I looked up a cheap hotel over a bakery on the Rue du Chateau , just off the Rue de Vanves , a place that Eugene had pointed out to me once . A few yards away was the bridge that spans the Montparnasse tracks . A familiar quarter . I could have had a room for a hundred francs a month , a room without any conveniences to be sure  --  without even a window  --  and perhaps I would have taken it , just to be sure of a place to flop for a while , had it not been for the fact that in order to reach this room I would have been obliged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The thought of passing his bed every night had a most depressingeffect upon me . I decided to look elsewhere . I went over to the Rue Cels , just behind the cemetery , and I looked at a sort of rat trap there with balconies running around the courtyard . There were birdcages suspended from the balcony too , all along the lower tier . A cheerful sight perhaps , but to me it seemed like the public ward in a hospital . The proprietor did n't seem to have all his wits either . I decided to wait for the night , to have a goodp210look around , and then choose some attractive little joint in a quiet side street . At dinnertime I spent fifteen francs for a meal , just about twice the amount I had planned to allot myself . That made me so wretched that I would n't allow myself to sit down for a coffee , even despite the fact that it had begun to drizzle . No , I would walk about a bit and then go quietly to bed , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to husband my resources this way . I had never in my life done it ; it was n't in my nature . Finally it began to come down in bucketsful . I was glad . That would give me the excuse I needed to duck somewhere and stretch my legs out . It was still too early to go to bed . I began to quicken my pace , heading back toward the Boulevard Raspail . Suddenly a woman comes up to me and stops me , right in the pouring rain . She wants to know what time it is . I told her I did n't have a watch . And then she bursts out , just like this : " Oh , my good sir , do you speak English by chance ? " I nod my head . It 's coming down in torrents now . " Perhaps , my dear good man , you would be so kind as to take me to a cafe . It is raining so and I have n't the money to sit down anywhere . You will excuse me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind face . . . I knew you were English right away . " And with this she smiles at me , a strange , half-demented smile . " Perhaps you could give me a little advice , dear sir . I am all alone in the world . . . my God , it is terrible to have no money . . . . " This " dear sir " and " kind sir " and " my good man , " etc. , had me on the verge of hysteria . I felt sorry for her and yet I had to laugh . I did laugh . I laughed right in her face . And then she laughed too , a weird , high-pitched laugh , off key , an altogether unexpected piece of cachinnation . I caught her by the arm and we made a bolt for it to the nearest cafe . She was still giggling when we enteredp211the bistro . " My dear good sir , " she began again , " perhaps you think I am not telling you the truth . I am a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only "  --  and here she gave me that wan , broken smile again  --  " only I am so misfortunate as not to have a place to sit down . " At this I began to laugh again . I could n't help it  --  the phrases she used , the strange accent , the crazy hat she had on , that demented smile ... . " Listen , " I interrupted , " what nationality are you ? " " I 'm English , " she replied . " That is , I was born in Poland , but my father is Irish . " So that makes you English ? " " Yes , " she said , and she began to giggle again , sheepishly , and with a pretense of being coy . " I suppose you know a nice little hotel where you could take me ? " I said this , not because I had any intention of going with her , but just to spare her the usual preliminaries . " Oh , my dear sir , " she said , as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sure you do n't mean that ! I 'm not that kind of a girl . You were joking with me , I can see that . You 're so good . . . you have such a kind face . I would not dare to speak to a Frenchman as I did to you . They insult you right away .... " She went on in this vein for some time . I wanted to break away from her . But she did n't want to be left alone . She was afraid  --  her papers were not in order . Would n't I be good enough to walk her to her hotel ? Perhaps I could " lend " her fifteen or twenty francs , to quiet the patron ? I walked her to the hotel where she said she was stopping and I put a fifty franc bill in her hand . Either she was very clever , or very innocent it 's hard to tell sometimes  --  but , at any rate , she wanted me to wait until she ran to the bistro for change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she seized my hand impulsively and raised it to her lips . I was flabbergasted . I felt like giving her every damned thing I had . That touched me , that crazy little gesture . I thought to myself , it 's good to be rich once in a while , just to get a new thrill like that . Just the same , I did n't lose my head . Fifty francs ! That was quite enough to squander on a rainy night . As I walked off she waved to me with that crazy little bonnet which she did n't know how to wear . It was as though we were old playmates . I felt foolish and giddy . " My dear kind sir .. . you have such a gentle face . . . you are so good , etc . " I felt like a saint . When you feel all puffed up inside it is n't so easy to go to bed right away . You feel as though you ought to atone for such unexpected bursts of goodness . Passing the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; women with bare backs and ropes of pearls choking them  --  or so it looked  --  were wiggling their beautiful bottoms at me . Walked right up to the bar and ordered a coupe of champagne . When the music stopped , a beautiful blonde  --  she looked like a Norwegian  --  took a seat right beside me . The place was n't as crowded or as gay as it had appeared from outside . There were only a half dozen couples in the place  --  they must have all been dancing at once . I ordered another coupe of champagne in order not to let my courage dribble away . When I got up to dance with the blonde there was no one on the floor but us . Any other time I would have been self-conscious , but the champagne and the way she clung to me , the dimmed lights and the solid feeling of security which the few hundred francs gave me , well . . . . We had another dance together , a sort of private exhibition , and then we fell into conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it started . I thought possibly she had had too much to drink , so I pretended not to be concerned . And meanwhile I was looking around to see if there was anyp213other timber available . But the place was thoroughly deserted . The thing to do when you 're trapped is to breeze  --  at once . If you do n't , you 're lost . What retained me , oddly enough , was the thought of paying for a hat check a second time . One always lets himself in for it because of a trifle . The reason she was weeping , I discovered soon enough , was because she had just buried her child . She was n't Norwegian either , but French , and a midwife to boot . A chic midwife , I must say , even with the tears running down her face . I asked her if a little drink would help to console her , whereupon she very promptly ordered a whisky and tossed it off in the wink of an eye . " Would you like another ? " I suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotten , so terribly dejected . She thought she would like a package of Camels too . " No , wait a minute , " she said , " I think I 'd rather have les Pall Mall . " Have what you like , I thought , but stop weeping , for Christ 's sake , it gives me the willies . I jerked her to her feet for another dance . On her feet she seemed to be another person . Maybe grief makes one more lecherous , I do n't know . I murmured something about breaking away . " Where to ? " she said eagerly . " Oh , anywhere . Some quiet place where we can talk . " I went to the toilet and counted the money over again . I hid the hundred franc notes in my fob pocket and kept a fifty franc note and the loose change in my trousers pocket . I went back to the bar determined to talk turkey . She made it easier for me because she herself introducedthe subject . She was in difficulties . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but her mother was home , ill , very ill , and there was the doctor to pay and medicine to be bought , and so on and so forth . I did n't believe a word of it , of course . And since I had to find a hotel forp214myself , I suggested that she come along with me and stay the night . A little economy there , I thought to myself . But she would n't do that . She insisted on going home , said she had an apartment to herself  --  and besides she had to look after her mother . On reflection I decided that it would be still cheaper sleeping at her place , so I said yes and let 's go immediately . Before going , however , I decidedit was best to let her know just how I stood , so that there would n't be any squawking at the last minute . I thought she was going to faint when I told her how much I had in my pocket . " The likes of it ! " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a scene ... . Undaunted , however , I stood my ground . " Very well , then , I 'll leave you , " I said quietly . " Perhaps I 've made a mistake . " " I should say you have ! " she exclaimed , but clutching me by the sleeve at the same time . " Ecoute , cheri ... sois raisonnable ! " When I heard that all my confidence was restored . 1 knew that it would be merely a question of promising her a little extra and everything would be O.K. " All right , " I said wearily , " I 'll be nice to you , you 'll see . " " You were lying to me , then ? " she said . " Yes , " I smiled , " I was just lying .... " Before I had even put my hat on she had hailed a cab . I heard her give the Boulevard de Clichy for an address . That was more than the price of room , I thought to myself . Oh well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . I do n't know how it started any more but soon she was raving to me about Henry Bordeaux . I have yet to meet a whore who does n't know of I leery Bordeaux ! But this one was genuinely inspired ; her language was beautiful now , so tender , so discerning , that I was debating how much to give her . It seemed to me that I had heard her say  --   | " quand it n'y aura plus de temps . " It sounded like that , anyway . In the state I was in , a phrase like that was worth a hundred francs . I wondered if it was her own or if she had pulled it from Henry Bordeaux . Little matter . It was just the right phrase with which to roll up to the foot of Montmartre . " Good evening , mother , " I was saying to myself , " daughter and I will look after you  --  quand it n'y aura plus de temps ! " She was going to show me her diploma , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once the door had closed behind us . Distracted . Wringing her hands and striking Sarah Bernhardt poses , half undressed too , and pausing between times to urge me to hurry , to get undressed , to do this and do that . Finally , when she had stripped down and was poking about with a chemise in her hand , searching for her kimono , I caught hold of her and gave her a good squeeze . She had a look of anguish on her face when I released her . " My God ! My God ! I must go downstairs and have a look at mother ! " she exclaimed . " You can take a bath if you like , cheri . There ! I 'll be back in a few minutes . " At the door I embraced her again . I was in my underclothes and I had a tremendous erection . Somehow all this anguish and excitement , all the grief and histrionics , only whetted my appetite . Perhaps she was just going downstairs to quiet her maquereau . I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drama which I would read about in the morning paper . I gave the place a quick inspection . There were two rooms and a bath , not badly furnished . Rather coquettish . There was her diploma on the wall  --  " first class , " as they all read . And there was the photograph of a child , a little girl with beautiful locks , on the dresser . I put the water on for a bath , and then I changed my mind . If something were to happen and I were found in the tub . . . I did n't like the idea . I paced back and forth , getting more and more uneasyas the minutes rolled by . When she returned she was even more upset than before . " She 's going to die . . . she 's going to die ! " she kept wailing . For a moment I was almost on the point of leaving . How the hell can you climb over a woman when her mother 's dying downstairs , perhaps right beneath you ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half determined to get what I had come for . As we stood thus she murmured , as if in real distress , her need for the money I had promised her . It was for " maman . " Shit , I did n't have the heart to haggle about a few francs at the moment . I walked over to the chair where my clothes were lying and I wiggled a hundred franc note out of my fob pocket , carefully keeping my back turned to her just the same . And , as a further precaution , I placed my pants on the side of the bed where I knew I was going to flop . The hundred francs was n't altogether satisfactory to her , but I could see from the feeble way that she protested that it was quite enough . Then , with an energy that astonishedme , she flung off her kimono and jumped into bed . As soon as I had put my arms around her and pulled her to me she reached for the switch and out went the lights . She embraced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do when they get you in bed . She was getting me frightfully roused with her carrying on ; that business of turning out the lights was a new one to me .. . it seemed like the real thing . But I was suspicious too , and as soon as I could manage conveniently I put my hands out to feel if my trousers were still there on the chair . I thought we were settled for the night . The bed felt very comfortable , softer than the average hotel bed  --  and the sheets were clean , I had noticed that . If only she would n't squirm so ! You would think she had n't sleptp217with a man for a month . I wanted to stretch it out . I wanted full value for my hundred francs . But she was mumbling all sorts of things in that crazy bed language which goes to your blood even more rapidly when it 's in the dark . I was putting up a stiff fight , but it was impossiblewith her groaning and gasping going on , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , c'est bon ! Oh , oh ! Vite , vite , cheri ! " I tried to count but it was like a fire alarm going off . " Vite , cheri ! " and this time she gave such a gasping shudder that bango ! I heard the stars chimingand there was my hundred francs gone and the fifty that I had forgotten all about and the lights were on again and with the same alacrity that she had bounced into bed she was bouncing out again and grunting and squealing like an old sow . I lay back and puffed a cigarette , gazing ruefully at my pants the while ; they were terribly wrinkled . In a moment she was back again , wrapping the kimonoaround her , and telling me in that agitated way which was getting on my nerves that I should make myselfat home . " I 'm going downstairs to see mother , " she said . " Mais faites comme chez vous , cheri . Je reviens tout de suite . " After a quarter of an hour had passed I began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read through a letterthat was lying on the table . It was nothing of any account  --  alove letter . In the bathroom I examined all the bottles on the shelf ; she had everything a woman requires to make herself smell beautiful . I was still hoping that she would come back and give me another fifty francs ' worth . But time dragged on and there was no sign of her . I began to grow alarmed . Perhaps there was someone dyingdownstairs . Absent-mindedly , out of a sense of selfpreservation , I suppose , I began to put my things on . As 1 was buckling my belt it came to me like a flash how shep218had stuffed the hundred franc note into her purse . In the excitement of the moment she had thrust the purse in the wardrobe , on the upper shelf . I remembered the gesture she made  --  standing on her tiptoes and reaching for the shelf . It did n't take me a minute to open the wardrobe and feel around for the purse . It was still there . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snugly between the silk coverlets . I put the purse back just as it was , slipped into my coat and shoes , and then I went to the landing and listened intently . I could n't hear a sound . Where she had gone to , Christ only knows . In a jiffy I was back at the wardrobe and fumbling with her purse . I pocketed the hundred francs and all the loose change besides . Then , closing the door silently , I tiptoed down the stairs and when once I had hit the street I walked just as fast as my legs would carry me . At the Cafe Boudon I stopped for a bite . The whores there having a gay time pelting a fat man who had fallen asleep over his meal . He was sound asleep ; snoring , in fact , and yet his jaws were working away mechanically . The place was in an uproar . There were shouts of " All aboard ! " and then a concertedbanging of knives and forks . He opened his eyes for a moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his chest . I put the hundred franc bill carefully away in my fob pocket and counted the change . The din around me was increasing and I had difficulty to recall exactly whether I had seen " first-class " on her diploma or not . It bothered me . About her mother I did n't give a damn . I hoped she had croaked by now . It would be strange if what she had said were true . Too good to believe . Vite chcri ... vite , vite ! And the other half-wit with her " my good sir " and " you have such a kind face " ! I wondered if she had really taken a room in that hotel we stopped by.  |p219It  was along the close of summer when Fillmore invited me to come and live with him . He had a studio apartment overlooking the cavalry barracks just off the Place Dupleix . We had seen a lot of each other since the little trip to Le Havre . If it had n't been for Fillmore I do n't know where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would have asked you long before , " he said , " if it had n't been for that little bitch Jackie . I did n't know how to get her off my hands . " I had to smile . It was always like that with Fillmore . I le had a genius for attracting homeless bitches . Anyway , Jackie had finally cleared out of her own accord . The rainy season was coming on , the long , dreary stretch of grease and fog and squirts of rain that make you damp and miserable . An execrable place in the winter , Paris ! A climate that eats into your soul , that leaves you bare as the Labrador coast . I noticed with some anxiety that the only means of heating the place was the little stove in the studio . However , it was still comfortable . And the view from the studio window was superb . In the morning Fillmore would shake me roughly and leave a ten franc note on the pillow . As soon as he had gone I would settle back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till noon . There was nothing pressing , except to finish the book , and that did n't worry me much because I was already convinced that nobody would accept it anyway . Nevertheless , Fillmore was much impressed by it . When he arrived in the evening with a bottle under his arm the first thing he did was to go to the table and seep220how many pages I had knocked off . At first I enjoyed this show of enthusiasm but later , when I was running dry , it made me devilishly uneasy to see him poking around , searching for the pages that were supposed to trickle out of me like water from a tap . When there was nothing to show I felt exactly like some bitch whom he had harbored . He used to say about Jackie , I remembered  --  " it would have been all right if only she had slipped me a piece of ass once in a while . " If I had been a woman I would have been only too glad to slip him a piece of ass : it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he expected . Nevertheless , he tried to make me feel at ease . There was always plenty of food and wine , and now and then he would insist that I accompany him to a dancing . He was fond of going to a nigger joint on the Rue d'Odessa where there was a good-looking mulatto who used to come home with us occasionally . The one thing that bothered him was that he could n't find a French girl who liked to drink . " l'hcy were all too sober to satisfy him  --  Hc liked to bring a woman back to the studio and guzzle it with her before getting down to business . He also liked to have her think that he was an artist . As the man from whom he had rented the place was a painter , it was not difficult to create an impression ; the canvases which we had found in the armoire were soon stuck about the place and one of the unfinished ones conspicuously mounted on the easel . Unfortunately they were all of a surrealistic quality and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a concierge and a cabinet minister there is not much difference in taste where picturesare concerned . It was a matter of great relief to Fillmorewhen Mark Swift began to visit us regularly with the intention of doing my portrait . Fillmore had a greatp221admiration for Swift . He was a genius , he said . And though there was something ferocious about everything he tackled nevertheless when he painted a man or an objectyou could recognize it for what it was . At Swift 's request I had begun to grow a beard . The shape of my skull , he said , required a beard . I had to sit by the window with the Eiffel Tower in back of me because he wanted the Eiffel Tower in the picture too . He also wanted the typewriter in the picture . Kruger got the habit of dropping in too about this time ; he maintained that Swift knew nothing about painting . It exasperated him to see things out of proportion . He believed in Nature'slaws , implicitly . Swift did n't give a fuck about Nature ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyway , there was Swift 's portrait of me stuck on the easel now , and though everything was out of proportion , even a cabinet minister could see that it was a human head , a man with a beard . The concierge , indeed , began to take a great interest in the picture ; she thought the likenesswas striking . And she liked the idea of showing the F , iffel Tower in the background . Things rolled along this way peacefully for about a month or more . The neighborhood appealed to me , particularlyat night when the full squalor and lugubriousnessof it made itself felt . The little Place , so charming and tranquil at twilight , could assume the most dismal , sinister character when darkness came on . There was that long , high wall covering one side of the barracks against which there was always a couple embracing each other furtively  --  often in the rain . A depressing sight to see two lovers squeezed against a prison wall under a gloomy street light : as if they had been driven right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also depressing . On a rainy day I used to stand by the windowp222and look down on the activity below , quite as if it were something going on on another planet . It seemed incomprehensible to me . Everything done according to schedule , but a schedule that must have been devised by a lunatic . There they were , floundering around in the mud , the bugles blowing , the horses charging  --  all within four walls . A sham battle . A lot of tin soldiers who had n't the least interest in learning how to kill or how to polish their boots or currycomb the horses . Utterly ridiculous the whole thing , but part of the scheme of things . When they had nothing to do they looked even more ridiculous ; they scratched themselves , they walked about with their hands in their pockets , they looked up at the sky . And when an officer came along they clicked their heels and saluted . A madhouse , it seemed to me . Even the horses looked silly . And then sometimes the artillery was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parade and people stood and gaped and admired the fine uniforms . To inc they always looked like an army corps in retreat ; something shabby , bedraggled , crestfallen about them , their uniforms too big for their bodies , all the alertness , which as individuals they possess to such a remarkable degree , gone now . When the sun came out , however , things looked different. ' rime was a ray of hope in their eyes , they walked more elastically , they showed a little enthusiasm . Then the color of things peeped out graciously and there was that fuss and bustle so characteristic of the French ; at the bistro on the corner they chattered gaily over their drinks and the officers seemed more human , more French , I might say . When the sun comes out , any spot in Paris can look beautiful ; and if there is a bistro with an awning rolled down , a few tables on the sidewalk and colored drinks in the glasses , then people look altogether human.  |p223And  they are human  --  the finest people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so indolent , so carefree ! It 's a crime to herd such a people into barracks , to put them through exercises , to grade them into privates and sergeants and colonels and what not . As I say , things were rolling along smoothly . Now and then Carl came along with a job for me , travel articles which he hated to do himself . They only paid fifty francs a piece , but they were easy to do because I had only to consult the back issues and revamp the old articles . People only read these things when they were sitting on a toilet or killing time in a waiting room . The principal thing was to keep the adjectives well furbished  --  the rest was a matter of dates and statistics . If it was an important article the head of the department signed it himself ; he was a half-wit who could n't speak any language well , but who knew how to find fault . If he found a paragraph that seemed to him well written he would say  --  " Now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's beautiful . You have my permission to use it in your book . " These beautiful paragraphs we sometimes lifted from the encyclopaedia or an old guide book . Some of them Carl did put into his hook  --  they had a surrealistic character . Then one evening , after I had been out for a walk , I open the door and a woman springs out of the bedroom . " So you 're the writer ! " she exclaims at once , and she looks at my beard as if to corroborate her impression . " What a horrid beard ! " she says . " I think you people must be crazy around here . " Fillmore is trailing after her with a blanket in his hand . " She 's a princess , " he says , smacking his lips as if he had just tasted some rare caviar . The two of them were dressed for the street ; I could n't understand what they were doing with the bedclothes . And then it occurred to me immediately that Fillmore must have dragged her into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always did that with a new woman , especially if she was a Francaise . " No tickee , no shirtee ! " that 's what was stitched on the laundry bag , and somehowFillmore had an obsession for explaining this motto to every female who arrived . But this dame was not a Francaise  --  he made that clear to me at once . She was Russian  --  and a princess , no less . He was bubbling over with excitement , like a child that has just found a new toy . " She speaks five languages ! " he said , obviously overwhelmed by such an accomplishment . " Non , four ! " she corrected promptly . " Well , four then . . . . Anyway , she 's a damned intelligentgirl . You ought to hear her speak . " The princess was nervous  --  she kept scratching her thigh and rubbing her nose . " Why does he want to make his bed now ? " she asked me abruptly . " Does he think he will get me that way ? He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a Russian restaurant and he danced like a nigger . " She wiggled her bottom to illustrate . " And he talks too much . Too loud . He talks nonsense . " She swished about the room , examining the paintings and the books , keeping her chin well up all the time but scratching herself intermittently . Now and then she wheeled around like a battleship and delivered a broadside . Fillmore kept following her about with a bottlein one hand and a glass in the other . " Stop following me like that ! " she exclaimed . " And have n't you anything to drink but this ? Ca n't you get a bottle of champagne ? I must have some champagne . My nerves ! My nerves ! " Fillmore tries to whisper a few words in my ear . " An actress . . . a movie star . . . some guy jilted her and she ca n't get over it . . . . I 'm going to get her cockeyed .... "  | " I 'll clear out then , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shout . " Why do you whisper like that ? " she cried , stamping her foot . " Do n't you know that 's not polite ? And you , I thought you were going to take me out ? I must get drunk tonight , I have told you that already . " " Yes , yes , " said Fillmore , " we 're going in a minute . I just want another drink . " " You 're a pig ! " she yelled . " But you 're a nice boy too . Only you 're loud . You have no manners . " She turned to me . " Can I trust him to behave himself ? I must get drunk tonight but I do n't want him to disgrace me . Maybe I will come back here afterward . I would like to talk to you . You seem more intelligent . " As they were leaving the princess shook my hand cordiallyand promised to come for dinner some evening  --  " when I will be sober , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along  --  or a countess , at least . We change the sheets every Saturday . " About three in the morning Fillmore staggers in .. . alone . Lit up like an ocean liner , and making a noise like a blind man with his cracked cane . Tap , tap , tap , down the weary lane . . . . " Going straight to bed , " he says , as he marches past me . " Tell you all about it tomorrow . " He goes inside to his room and throws back the covers . I hear him groaning  --  " what a woman ! what a woman ! " In a second he 's out again , with his hat on and the cracked cane in his hand . " I knew something like that was going to happen . She 's crazy ! " He rummages around in the kitchen a while and then comes back to the studio with a bottle of Anjou . I have to sit up and down a glass with him . As far as I can piece the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Champs Elysees where he had dropped off for a drink on his way home . As usual at that hour the terrasse was crowded with buzzards . This one was sitting right on the aisle with a pile of saucers in front of her ; she was getting drunk quietly all by herself when Fillmore happened along and caught her eye . " I 'm drunk , " she giggled , " wo n't you sit down ? " And then , as though it were the most natural thing in the world to do , she began right off the bat with the yarn about her movie director , how he had given her the go-by and how she had thrown herself in the Seine and so forth and so on . She could n't remember any more which bridge it was , only that there was a crowd around when they fished her out of the water . Besides , she did n't see what difference it made which bridge she threw herself from  --  why did he ask such questions ? She was laughing hysterically about it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  she wanted to dance . Seeing him hesitate she opens her bag impulsively and pulls out a hundred franc note . The next moment , however , she decided that a hundred francs would n't go very far . " I lavc n't you any money at all ? " she said . No , he had n't very much in his pocket , but he had a checkbook at home . So they made a dash for the checkbook and then , of course , I had to happen in just as he was explaining to her the " No tickee , no shirtee " business . On the way home they had stopped off at the Poisson d'Or for a little snack which she had washed down with a few vodkas . She was in her clement there with everyone kissing her hand and murmuring Princesse , Princesse . Drunk as she was , she managed to collect her dignity . " Do n't wiggle your behind like that ! " she kept saying , as they danced . It was Fillmore 's idea , when he brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since she was such an intelligent girl and so erratic , he had decided to put up with her whims and postpone the grand event . He had even visualizedthe prospect of running across another princess and bringing the two of them back . When they started out for the evening , therefore , he was in a good humor and prepared , if necessary , to spend a few hundred francs on her . After all , one does n't run across a princess every day . This time she dragged him to another place , a place where she was still better known and where there would be no trouble in cashing a check , as she said . Everybody was in evening clothes and there was more spine-breaking , hand-kissing nonsense as the waiter escorted them to a table . In the middle of a dance she suddenly walks off the floor , with tears in her eyes . " What 's the matter ? " he said , " what did I do this time ? " And instinctively he put his hand to his backside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's nothing , " she said . " You did n't do anything . Come , you 're a nice boy , " and with that she drags him on to the floor again and begins to dance with abandon . " But what 's the matter with you ? " he murmured . " It 's nothing , " she repeated . " I saw somebody , that 's all . " And then , with a sudden spurt of anger  --  " why do you get me drunk ? Do n't you know it makes me crazy ? " " Have you got a check ? " she says . " We must get out of here . " She called the waiter over and whispered to him in Russian . " Is it a good check ? " she asked , when the waiter had disappeared . And then , impulsively : " Wait for me downstairs in the cloakroom . I must telephone somebody . " After the waiter had brought the change Fillmore sauntered leisurely downstairs to the cloakroom to wait for her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and smacking his lips in anticipation of the caviar to come . Five minutes passed . Ten minutes . Still whistlingsoftly . When twenty minutes had gone by and still no princess he at last grew suspicious . The cloakroom attendant said that she had left long ago . He dashed outside . There was a nigger in livery standing there with a big grin on his face . Did the nigger know where she had breezed to ? Nigger grins . Nigger says : " Ah heerd Coupole , dassall sir ! " At the Coupole , downstairs , he finds her sitting in front of a cocktail with a dreamy , trancelike expression on her face . She smiles when she sees him . " Was that a decent thing to do , " he says , " to run away like that ? You might have told me that you did n't like me .... She flared up at this , got theatrical about it . And after a lot of gushing she commenced to whine and slobber . " I 'm crazy , " she blubbered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to sleep with you , and I do n't want to sleep with you . " And then she began to rave about her lover , the movie director whom she had seen on the dance floor . That 's why she had to run away from the place . That 's why she took drugs and got drunk every night . That 's why she threw herself in the Seine . She babbled on this way about how crazy she was and then suddenly she had an idea . " Let 's go to Bricktop 's ! " There was a man there whom she knew ... he had promised her a job once . She was certain he would help her . " What 's it going to cost ? " asked Fillmore cautiously . It would cost a lot , she let him know that immediately . " But listen , if you take me to Bricktop 's , I promise to gohome with you . " She was honest enough to add that itmight cost him five or six hundred francs . " But I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am . There is n't anotherwomen like me in all Paris .... " " That 's what you think ! " His Yankee blood was coming to the fore . " But I do n't see it . I do n't see that you 're worth anything . You 're just a poor crazy son-of-a-bitch . Frankly , I 'd rather give fifty francs to some poor French girl ; at least they give you something in return . " She hit the ceiling when he mentioned the French girls . " Do n't talk to me about those women ! I hate them ! They 're stupid . . . they 're ugly . . . they 're mercenary . Stop it , I tell you ! " In a moment she had subsided again . She was on a new tack . " Darling , " she murmured , " you do n't know what I look like when I 'm undressed . I 'm beautiful ! " And she held her breasts with her two hands . But Fillmore remained unimpressed . " You 're a bitch ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few hundred francs on you , but you 're crazy . You have n't even washed your face . Your breath stinks . I do n't give a damn whether you 're a princess or not . . . I do n't want any of your high-assed Russian variety . You ought to get out in the street and hustle for it . You 're no better than any little French girl . You 're not as good . I would n't piss away another sou on you . You ought to go to America  --  that 's the place for a bloodsucking leech like you .... " She did n't seem to be at all put out by this speech . " I think you 're just a little afraid of me , " she said . " Afraid of you ? Of you ? " " You 're just a little boy , " she said . " You have no manners . When you know me better you will talk differently . . . . Why do n't you try to be nice ? If you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I will be at the Rond-Point tomorrow between five and seven . I like you . "  | " I do n't intend to be at the Rond-Point tomorrow , or any other night ! I do n't want to see you again . . . ever . I 'm through with you . I 'm going out and find myself a nice little French girl . You can go to hell ! " She looked at him and smiled wearily . " That 's what you say now . But wait ! Wait until you 've slept with me . You do n't know yet what a beautiful body I have . You think the French girls know how to make love . . . wait ! I will make you crazy about me . I like you . Only you 're uncivilized . You 're just a boy . You talk too much . . . . " " You 're crazy , " said Fillmore . " I would n't fall for you if you were the last woman on earth . Go home and wash your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks . In a few days , however , the princess was installed . She 's a genuine princess , of that we 're pretty certain . But she has the clap . Anyway , life is far from dull here . Fillmorehas bronchitis , the princess , as I was saying , has the clap , and I have the piles . Just exchanged six empty bottlesat the Russian epicene across the way . Not a drop went down my gullet . No meat , no wine , no rich game , no women . Only fruit and paraffin oil , arnica drops and adrenalin ointment . And not a chair in the joint that 's comfortable enough . Right now , looking at the princess , I 'm propped up like a pasha . Pasha ! That reminds me of her name : Macha . Does n't sound so damned aristocratic to me . Reminds me of The Living Corpse . At first I thought it was going to be embarrassing , a menage d trois , but not at all . I thought when I saw her move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I should have to find another place , but Fillmore soon gave me to understand that he was only putting her up until she got on her feet . With a woman like her I do n't know what an expression like that means ; as far as I can see she 's been standing on her head all her life . She says the revolutionp231drove her out of Russia , but I 'm sure if it had n't been the revolution it would have been something else . She 's under the impression that she 's a great actress ; we never contradict her in anything she says because it 's time wasted . Fillmore finds her amusing . When he leaves for the office in the morning he drops ten francs on her pillow and ten francs on mine ; at night the three of us go to the Russian restaurant down below . The neighborhood is full of Russians and Macha has already found a place where she can run up a little credit . Naturally ten francs a day is n't anything for a princess ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she needs a complete new wardrobe in order to get a job in the movies again . She has nothing to do now except to kill time . She 's putting on fat . This morning I had quite a fright . After I had washed my face I grabbed her towel by mistake . We ca n't seem to train her to put her towel on the right hook . And when I bawled her out for it she answered smoothly : " My dear , if one can become blind from that I would have been blind years ago . " And then there 's the toilet , which we all have to use . I try speaking to her in a fatherly way about the toilet seat . " Oh zut ! " she says . " If you are so afraid I 'll go to a cafe . " But it 's not necessary to do that , I explain . Just use ordinaryprecautions . " Tut tut ! " she says , " I wo n't sit down then . . . I 'll stand up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would n't come across because she had the monthlies . For eight days that lasted . We were beginning to think she was faking it . But no , she was n't faking . One day , when I was trying to put the place in order , I found some cotton batting under the bed and it was stained with blood . With her everything goes under the bed : orange peel , wadding , corks , empty bottles , scissors , used condoms , books , pillows . . . . She makes the bed only when it 's time to retire . Most of the time she lies abed reading her Russian papers . " My dear , " she says to me , " if it were n't for my papers I would n't get out of bed at all . " That 's it precisely ! Nothing but Russian newspapers . Not a scratch of toilet paper around  --  nothing but Russian newspapers with which to wipe your ass . Anyway , speaking of her idiosyncrasies , after the menstrual flow was over , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat around her belt , still she would n't come across . Pretended that she only liked women . To take on a man she had to first be properly stimulated . Wanted us to take her to a bawdy house where they put on the dog and man act . Or better still , she said , would be Leda and the swan : the flapping of the wings excited her terribly . One night , to test her out , we accompanied her to a place that she suggested . But before we had a chance to broach the subject to the madam , a drunken Englishman , who was sitting at the next table , fell into a conversation with us . He had already been upstairs twice but he wanted another try at it . He had only about twenty francs in his pocket , and not knowing any French , he asked us if we would help him to bargain with the girl he had his eye on . I-Iappened she was a Negress , a powerful wench from Martinique , and beautiful as a panther . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to accept the Englishman 's remaining sous , Fillmore had to promise to go with her himself soon as she got through with the Englishman . The princess looked on , heard everything that was said , and then got on her high horse . She was insulted . " Well , " said Fillmore , " you wanted some excitement  --  you can watch me do it ! " She didn'tp233want to watch him  --  she wanted to watch a drake . " Well , by Jesus , " he said , " I 'm as good as a drake any day .. . maybe a little better . " Like that , one word led to another , and finally the only way we could appease her was to call one of the girls over and let them tickle each other ... When Fillmore came back with the Negress her eyes were smoldering . I could see from the way Fillmore looked at her that she must have given an unusual performanceand I began to feel lecherous myself . Fillmore must have sensed how I felt , and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , for suddenly he pulled a hundred franc note out of his pocket and slapping it in front of me , he said : " Look here , you probably need a lay more than any of us . Take that and pick someone out for yourself . " Somehow that gesture endeared him more to me than anything he had ever done for me , and he had done considerable . I accepted the money in the spirit it was given and promptly signaled to the Negress to get ready for another lay . That enraged the princess more than anything , it appeared . She wanted to know if there was n't anyone in the place good enough for us except this Negress . I told her bluntly NO . And it was so  --  the Negress was the queen of the harem . You had only to look at her to get an erection . Her eyes seemed to be swimming in sperm . She was drunk with all the demands made upon her . She could n't walk straight any more  --  at least , it seemed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind her I could n't resist the temptation to slide my hand up her crotch ; we continued up the stairs that way , she looking back at me with a cheerful smile and wiggling her ass a bit when it tickled her too much . It was a good session all around . Everyone was happy . Macha seemed to be in a good mood too . And so the next evening , after she had had her ration of champagne and caviar , after she had given us another chapter out of the history of her life , Fillmore went to work on her . It seemed as though he was going to get his reward at last . She had ceased to put up a fight any more . She lay back with her legs apart and she let him fool around and fool around and then , just as he was climbing over her , just as he was going to slip it in , she informs him nonchalantly that she has a dose of clap . He rolled off her like a log . I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he used on special occasions , and in a few moments he was standing by my bed with a towel in his hands and saying  --  " can you beat that ? that son-of-a-bitch of a princess has the clap ! " He seemed pretty well scared about it . The princess meanwhile was munching an apple and calling for her Russian newspapers . It was quite a joke to her . " There are worse things than that , " she said , lying there in her bed and talking to us through the open door . Finally Fillmore began to see it as a joke too and opening another bottle of Anjou he poured out a drink for himself and quaffed it down . It was only about one in the morning and so he sat there talking to me for a while . He was n't going to be put off by a thing like that , he told me . Of course , he had to be careful . . . there was the old dose which had come on in Le Havre . He could n't remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk he forgot to wash himself . It was n't anything very terrible , but you never knew what might develop later . He did n't want any one massaging his prostate gland . No , that he did n't relish . The first dose he ever got was at college . Did n't know whether the girl had given it to him or he to the girl ; there was so much funny work going on about the campus you did n't know whom to believe . Nearly all the coeds had been knocked up some time or other . Too damned ignorant . . . even the profs werep235ignorant . One of the profs had himself castrated , so the rumor went ... . Anyway , the next night he decided to risk it  --  with a condom . Not much risk in that , unless it breaks . He had bought himself some of the long fish skin variety  --  they were the most reliable , he assured me . But then , that did n't work either . She was too tight . " Jesus , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How do you make that out ? Somebody got inside her all right to give her that dose . He must have been abnormally small . " So , one thing after another failing , he just gave it up altogether . They lie there now like brother and sister , with incestuous dreams . Says Macha , in her philosophic way : " In Russia it often happens that a man sleeps with a woman without touching her . They can go on that way for weeks and weeks and never think anything about it . Until paff ! once he touches her . . . paff ! pall ! After that it 's paff , paff , paff ! " All efforts are concentrated now on getting Macha into shape . Fillmore thinks if he cures her of the clap she may loosen up . A strange idea . So he 's bought her a douche bag , a stock of permanganate , a whirling syringe and other little things which were recommended to him by a Hungarian doctor , a little quack of an abortionist over near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a sixteen-year-old girl once and she had introduced him to the Hungarian ; and then after that the boss had a beautifulchancre and it was the Hungarian again . That 's how one gets acquainted in Paris  --  genito-urinary friendships . Anyway , under our strict supervision , Macha is taking care of herself . The other night , though , we were in a quandary for a while . She stuck the suppository inside her and then she could n't find the string attached to it . " Myp236God ! " she was yelling , " where is that string ? My God ! I ca n't find the string ! " " Did you look under the bed ? " said Fillmore . Finally she quieted down . But only for a few minutes . The next thing was : " My God ! I 'm bleeding again . I just had my period and now there are gouttes again . It must be that cheap champagne you buy . My God , do you want me to bleed to death ? " She comes out with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to look dignifiedas usual . " My whole life is just like that , " she says . " I 'm a neurasthenic . The whole day running around and at night I 'm drunk again . When I came to Paris I was still an innocent girl . I read only Villon and Baudelaire . But as I had then 300,000 Swiss francs in the bank I was crazy to enjoy myself , because in Russia they were always strict with me . And as I was even more beautiful then than I am now . I had all the men falling at my feet . " Here she hitched up the slack which had accumulated around her belt . " You must n't think I had a stomach like that when I came here . . . that 's from all the poison I was given to drink ... those horrible aperitifs which the French are so crazy to drink .... So then I met my movie director and he wanted that I should play a part for him . He said I was the most gorgeous creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him every night . I was a foolish young virgin and so I permitted him to rape me one night . I wanted to be a great actress and I did n't know he was full of poison . So he gave me the clap . . . and now I want that he should have it back again . It 's his fault that I committed suicide in the Seine .... Why are you laughing ? Do n't you believe that I committed suicide ? I can show you the newspapers . . . there is my picture in all the papers . I will show you the Russian papers some day .. . they wrote about me wonderfully . . . . But darling , youp237know that first I must have a new dress . I ca n't vamp this man with these dirty rags I am in . Besides , I still owe my dressmaker 12,000 francs . . . . " From here on it 's a long story about the inheritance which she is trying to collect . She has a young lawyer , a Frenchman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is trying to win back her fortune . From time to time he used to give her a hundred francs or so on account . " He 's stingy , like all the French people , " she says . " And I was so beautiful , too , that he could n't keep his eyes off me . He kept beggingme always to fuck him . I got so sick and tired of listening to him that one night I said yes , just to keep him quiet , and so as I would n't lose my hundred francs now and then . " She paused a moment to laugh hysterically . " My dear , " she continued , " it was too funny for words what happened to him . He calls me up on the phone one day and he says : " I must see you right away ... it 's very important . " And when I see him he shows me a paper from the doctor  --  and it 's gonorrhea ! My dear , I laughed in his face . How should I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to fuck me and so I fucked you ! " That made him quiet . That 's how it goes in life ... you do n't suspect anything , and then all of a sudden paff , paff , paff ! He was such a fool that he fell in love with me all over again . Only he begged me to behave myself and not run around Montparnasse all night drinking and fucking . He said I was driving him crazy . He wanted to marry me and then his family heard about me and they persuaded him to go to Indo-China .... " From this Macha calmly switches to an affair she had with a Lesbian . " It was very funny , my dear , how she picked me up one night . I was at the " Fetiche " and I was drunk as usual . She took me from one place to the other and she made love to me under the table all night until Ip238could n't stand it any more . Then she took me to her apartment and for two hundred francs I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live with her but I did n't want to have her suck me off every night . . . it makes you too weak . Besides , I can tell you that I do n't care so much for Lesbiansas I used to . I would rather sleep with a man even though it hurts me . When I get terribly excited I ca n't hold myself back any more . . . three , four , five times . . . just like that ! Paff , paff , paff ! And then I bleed and that is very unhealthy for me because I am inclined to be anemic . So you see why once in a while I must let myself be sucked by a Lesbian .... "  |p239When  the cold weather set in the princess disappeared . It was getting uncomfortable with just a little coal stove in the studio ; the bedroom was like an icebox and the kitchen was hardly any better . There was just a little space around the stove where it was actually warm . So Macha had found herself a sculptor who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left . After a few days she tried coming back to us , but Fillmore would n't hear of it . She complained that the sculptor kept her awake all night kissing her . And then there was no hot water for her douches . But finally she decided that it was just as well she did n't come back . " I wo n't have that candlestick next to me any more , " she said . " Always that candlestick. . . it made me nervous . If you had only been a fairy I would have stayed with you .... " With Macha gone our evenings took on a different character . Often we sat by the fire drinking hot toddies and discussing the life back there in the States . We talked about it as if we never expected to go back there again . Fillmore had a map of New York City which he had tacked on the wall ; we used to spend whole evenings discussingthe relative virtues of Paris and New York . And inevitably there always crept into our discussions the figure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the course of her brief life . In Whitman the whole American scene comes to life , her past and her future , her birth and her death . Whatever there is of value in America Whitman has expressed , and there is nothing more to be said . The future belongs to the machine , to the robots . he was the Poet of the Body and the Soul , Whitman . The first and the last poet . He is almost undecipherabletoday , a monument covered with rude hieroglyphs for which there is no key . It seems strange almost to mentionhis name over here . There is no equivalent in the languages of Europe for the spirit which he immortalized . Europe is saturated with art and her soil is full of dead bones and her museums are bursting with plundered treasures , but what Europe has never had is a free , healthy spirit , what you might call a MAN . Goethe was the nearest approach , but Goethe was a stuffed shirt , by comparison . Goethe was a respectable citizen , a pedant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the German trade-mark , with the double eagle . The serenity of Goethe , the calm , Olympian attitude , is nothing more than the drowsy stupor of a German burgeois deity . Goethe is an end of something , Whitman is a beginning . After a discussion of this sort I would sometimes put on my things and go for a walk , bundled up in a sweater , a spring overcoat of Fillmore 's and a cape over that . A foul , damp cold against which there is no protection except a strong spirit . They say America is a country of extremes , and it is true that the thermometer registers degreesof cold which are practically unheard of here ; but the cold of a Paris winter is a cold unknown to America , it is psychological , an inner as well as an outer cold . If it never freezes here it never thaws either . Just as the people protect themselves against the invasion of their privacy , by their high walls , their bolts and shutters , their growling , evil-tongued , slatternly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cold and heat of a bracing , vigorous climate . They have fortified themselves : protection is the keyword . Protection and secur/ity . In order that they may rot in comfort . On a damp winter 's night it is not necessary to look at the map to discover the latitude of Paris . It is a northern city , an outposterected over a swamp filled in with skulls and bones . Along the boulevards there is a cold electrical imitation of heat . Tout Va Bien in ultraviolet rays that make the clients of the Dupont chain cafes look like gangrened cadavers . Tout Va Bien ! That 's the motto that nourishes the forlorn beggars who walk up and down all night underthe drizzle of the violet rays . Wherever there are lights there is a little heat . One gets warm from watching the fat , secure bastards down their grogs , their steaming black coffees . Where the lights are there are people on the sidewalks , jostling one another , giving off a little animalheat through their dirty underwear and their foul , cursing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocks there is a semblance of gaiety , and then it tumbles back into night , dismal , foul , black night like frozen fat in a soup tureen . Blocks and blocks of jagged tenements , every window closed tight , every shopfront barred and bolted . Miles and miles of stone prisons without the faintestglow of warmth ; the dogs and the cats are all inside with the canary birds . The cockroaches and the bedbugs too are safely incarcerated . Tout Va Bien . If you have n't a sou why just take a few old newspapers and make yourself a bed on the steps of a cathedral . The doors are well bolted and there will be no draughts to disturb you . Better still is to sleep outside the Metro doors ; there you will have company . Look at them on a rainy night , lying there stiff as mattresses  --  men , women , lice , all huddled togetherand protected by the newspapers against spittle and the vermin that walks without legs . Look at them under the bridges or under the market sheds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright vegetables stacked up like jewels . Even the dead horses and the cows and sheep hanging from the greasy hooks look more inviting . At least we will eat these tomorrow and even the intestines will serve a purpose . But these filthy beggars lying in the rain , what purpose do they serve ? What good can they do us ? They make us bleed for five minutes , that 's all . Oh , well , these are night thoughts produced by walkingin the rain after two thousand years of Christianity . At least now the birds arc well provided for , and the cats and dogs . Every time I pass the concierge 's window and catch the full icy impact of her glance I have an insane desire to throttle all the birds in creation . At the bottom of every frozen heart there is a drop or two of love  --  just enough to feed the birds . Still I ca n't get it out of my mind what a discrepancy there is between ideas and living . A permanent dislocation , though we try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wo n't go . Ideas have to be wedded to action ; if there is no sex , no vitality in them , there is no action . Ideas can not exist alone in the vacuum of the mind . Ideas are related to living : liver ideas , kidney ideas , interstitial ideas , etc . If it were only for the sake of an idea Copernicuswould have smashed the existent macrocosm and Columbus would have foundered in the Sargasso Sea . The aesthetics of the idea breeds flowerpots and flowerpots you put on the window sill . But if there be no rain or sun of what use putting flowerpots outside the window ? Fillmore is full of ideas about gold . The " mythos " of gold , he calls it . I like " mythos " and I like the idea of gold , but I am not obsessed by the subject and I do n't see why we should make flowerpots , even of gold . He tells me that the French are hoarding their gold away in watertightcompartments deep below the surface of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locomotive which runs around in these subterranean vaults and corridors . I like the idea enormously . A profound , uninterrupted silence in which the gold softly snoozes at a temperature of 17degrees Centigrade . He says an army working 46 days and 37 hours would not be sufficient to count all the gold that is sunk beneath the Bank of France , and that there is a reserve supply of false teeth , bracelets , wedding rings , etc . Enough food also to last for eighty days and a lake on top of the gold pile to resist the shock of high explosives . Gold , he says , tends to become more and more invisible , a myth , and no more defalcations . Excellent ! I am wondering what will happen to the world when we go off the gold standard in ideas , dress , morals , etc . The gold standard of love ! Up to the present , my idea in collaborating with myself has been to get off the gold standard of literature . My idea briefly has been to present a resurrection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human being in the stratosphere of ideas , that is , in the grip of delirium . To paint a preSocraticbeing , a creature part goat , part Titan . In short , to erect a world on the basis of the omphalos , not on an abstract idea nailed to a cross . Here and there you may have come across neglected statues , oases untapped , windmillsoverlooked by Cervantes , rivers that run uphill , women with five and six breasts ranged longitudinally along the torso . ( Writing to Gauguin , Strindberg said : " J'ai vu des arbres que ne retrouverait aucun botanists , des animaux que Cuvier n'a jamais soupconnes et des hommes que vous soul avez pu creer . " ) When Rembrandt hit par he went below with the gold ingots and the pemmican and the portable beds . Gold is a night word belonging to the chthonian mind : it has dream in it and mythos . We are reverting to alchemy , to thatp244fake Alexandrian wisdom which produced our inflated symbols . Real wisdom is being stored away in the subcellarsby the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be circling around in the middle air with magnetizers ; to find a piece of ore you will have to go up ten thousand feet with a pair of instruments  --  in a cold latitudepreferably  --  and establish telepathic communication with the bowels of the earth and the shades of the dead . No more Klondikes . No more bonanzas . You will have to learn to sing and caper a bit , to read the zodiac and study your entrails . All the gold that is being tucked away in the pockets of the earth will have to be re-mined ; all this symbolism will have to be dragged out again from the bowels of man . But first the instruments must be perfected . First it is necessary to invent better airplanes , to distinguish where the noise comes from and not go daffy just because you hear an explosion under your ass . And secondly it will be necessary to get adapted to the cold layers of the stratosphere , to become a cold-blooded fish of the air . No reverence . No piety . No longing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Philippe Datz says  --  " NO DISCOURAGEMENT ! " " These are sunny thoughts inspired by a vermouth cassis at the Place de la Trinite . A Saturday afternoon and a " misfire " book in my hands . Everything swimming in a divine mucopus . The drink leaves a hitter herbish taste in my mouth , the lees of our Great Western civilization , rotting now like the toenails of the saints . Women are passing by  --  regiments of them  --  all swinging their asses in front of me ; the chimes are ringing and the buses are climbing the sidewalk and bussing one another . The garcon wipes the table with a dirty rag while the patronne tickles the cash register with fiendish glee . A look of vacuity on my face , blotto , vague in acuity , biting thep245asses that brush by me . In the belfry opposite the hunchbackstrikes with a golden mallet and the pigeons scream alarum . I open the book  --  the book which Nietzsche called " the best German book there is "  --  and it says : " MEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BETTER , HAPPIER , AND STRONGER IN ACTIONOR , AT LEAST , ONLY AT EPOCHS . I FORESEE THE TIME WHEN GOD WILL HAVE NO MORE JOY IN THEM , BUT WILL BREAK UP EVERYTHING FOR A RENEWED CREATION . I AM CERTAIN THAT EVERYTHING IS PLANNED TO THIS END , AND THAT THE TIME AND HOUR IN THE DISTANT FUTURE I . OR THE OCCURRENCE OF THIS RENOVATING EPOCH ARE ALREADY FIXED . BUT A LONG TIME WILL ELAPSE FIRST , AND WE MAY STILL FOR THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS AMUSE OURSELVES ON THIS DEAR OLD SURFACE . " Excellent ! At least a hundred years ago there was a man who had vision enough to see that the world was pooped out . Our Western world !  --  When I see the figures of men and women moving listlessly behind their prison walls , sheltered , secluded for a few brief hours , I am appalledby the potentialities for drama that are still contained in these feeble bodies . Behind the gray walls there are human sparks , and yet never a conflagration . Are these men and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows of puppets dangled by invisible strings ? They move in freedom apparently , but they have nowhere to go . In one realm only are they free and there they may roam at will  --  but they have not yet learned how to take wing . So far there have been no dreams that have taken wing . Not one man has been born light enough , gay enough , to leave the earth ! The eagles who flapped their mighty pinions for a while came crashing heavily to earth . They made us dizzy with the flap and whir of their wings . Stay on the earth , you eagles of the future !
