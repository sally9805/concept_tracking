Since the Nazis took control of Austria 's music , leaving the future of Austria 's famed Salzburg Festival in doubt , the air from Hollywood to Paris has resounded with projects for new " Salzburgs " outside Greater Germany . While most of these projects have been evaporating in talk , certain features of the Salzburg idea have quietly come into being at Glyndebourne , an old Tudor manor in the midst of England 's hilly South Downs , 60 miles from London . Glyndebourne , content to remain in character , has not proclaimed itself the " Salzburg of England . " But responsible critics have acclaimed the Mozart opera performances given there each year as the finest in the world today . <P> Last week , as Glyndebourne opened its fifth season of opera ( eight weeks ) , fashionable Londoners piled into trains and automobiles for their annual pilgrimage . The 600 seats in Glyndebourne 's diminutive opera house cost between $7.50 and $10 apiece , and dinner at Glyndebourne served between the acts adds another $2 to the visitor 's bill . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealthy ex-science teacher at England 's swagger Eton College , and present owner of Glyndebourne Manor . A lifetime lover and patron of music , a constant attender at the Salzburg and Bayreuth Festivals , Captain Christie long had an ambition to establish an operatic festival of similar quality in England . In 1933 at Copenhagen he unfolded his scheme to round-faced Conductor Fritz Busch , German political exile and famed former conductor of the Dresden Opera . Enthusiastic Maestro Busch called in the help of his expatriated countryman , Stage Director Carl Ebert . With Austrian Impresario Rudolf Bing as General Manager , the first Glyndebourne opera season was launched . It lasted two weeks ; the audience for the opening performance numbered twelve . But Christie , Busch , Ebert and Bing were undiscouraged . The press gave them a big hand . In 1936 they enlarged their auditorium , planned a bigger season for the following year . By the end of the 1936 season they were playing to full houses . Last year , all of Glyndebourne 's seats were sold before its seven-week season had begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
