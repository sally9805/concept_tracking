txt In a hearing charged with feeling the Senate Military Affairs Committee went deeply today into the question whether the administration directed the purchase of 200,000 kits for members of the Civilian Conservation Corps without competitive bids . The price has been described by War Department officials as $100,000 more than that for which the Quartermaster Corps could have bought the kits . The committee examined with particular interest a letter written on May 16 by Louis Howe , Presidential secretary , and bearing the penned approval of President Roosevelt , authorizing Robert Fechner , director of the corps , to take the purchase of kits into his own hands . Mr. Fechner assumed full responsibility for the contract . He said he had recommended this course after James J. , his assistant , on a visit to the first forestry camp had examined " three or four " ' toiletry items issued by the War Department and found them defective . He then made preliminary arrangements with Richard Be Vier , president of the Be Vier Corporation of New York , to buy toilet kits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called to testify late in the day , verified Mr. Fechner's1 testimony that the sole information , they had on the contract or the 1 values of the articles purchased was furnished by Mr. Be Vier . He was questioned about a memorandum from his files indicating the Be Vier Corporation had once offered to furnish kits at $1.10 each . General Dewitt Sets 75c Price . Before these officials were called Major Gen. John L. Dewitt , Quartermaster General of the army , told the committee that he could purchase all the articles in the forestry toilet kits , including the box , for 175 cents . He added that if the articles were brought up to army standards the whole thing would cost 85.84 cents , on the basis of estimates recently collected by him . General Dewitt described a conversation with Mr. Fechner in which he said the latter instructed him to cease arranging for toilet articles for the men in the conservation corps " by instruction of the President .

Later it is planned to recall Mr. Howe , who was heard in executive session yesterday , and probably to question Lewis W. Douglas ; Director of the Budget . The hearing was more like a grand jury investigation than a routine Senatorial inquiry . All wit-1 nesses were placed under oath . The chief burden of questioning was carried by Senators Black and Reynolds , Democrats , although a Republican , Senator Carey , precipitated the inquiry . Senator , . Reynolds tried to obtain from - Mr. 14c/titer or Mr. a statement of the profit expected to be made by Mr. Be Vier . Mr. Fechner finally admitted that Mr. Be Vier had told him the figure , but declined to name it until threat , ened by Chairman Sheppard with contempt of the Senate . Then he said he " believed " Mr. Be Vier had named 15 per cent as his probable profit .

The letter follows : May 16 , 1933 . Dear Mr. Fechner : It has come to my attention that toilet articles for the men of the Conservation Corps , including such things as tooth brushes , shaving brushes , combs , razors and holders , shaving soap , &c.,; can be purchased in the form of kits containing more items and of a much higher quality at a considerable less price ' than they would cost if purchased singly , or if procured through the War Department in their regular manner of purchases and issues for soldiers . I have seen the inferior articles referred to , and I have seen the kits of superior articles . I understand that you are on the point of making these purchases through the War Department , and that the Quartermaster General has asked for proposals . I wish you would take charge of these purchases and make them directly as Director of the Emergency Conservation Work or by using such agencies as you see fit so long as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that you are in need of specific authority for taking this matter into your own hands , this letter will serve the purpose . Yours very truly , ( Signed ) LOUIS . HOWE . Approved : Franklin D. Roosevelt , May 16 , 1933 . General Dewitt told the committee that he had prepared to supply the Conservation Corps with all necessities as soon as it was authorized , under the general understanding the War Department would furnish supplies , but added that Mr. Fechner telephoned to him to cease purchasing toilet articles . General Dewitt also declared that while the Fechner-Be Vier contract involved $280,000 , the War Department could obtain identical supplies for $172,826 . He added that the form of contract entered into involves a probable outlay of an additional $100.000 for other items , including delivery . Mr. Fechner at the outset of his testimony assumed complete responsibility for the contract . He said Mr. Be Vier displayed order slips showing that the articles had been sold at higher prices to army canteens and contended that an emergency existed , due to the haste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sufficient cause to waive ordinary procedure . " Do n't you think you made a bad contract ? " demanded Senator Reynolds . " I do not , " the witness said . Mr. Fechner said that on the afternoon of May 12 he called on Mr. Howe at the White House offices and " explained the whole situation " to him while Budget Director Douglas was present . " Mr. Howe went in to see the President , accompanied by Mr. Douglas , " he said . " He came back later and told me the President gave his approval . "
