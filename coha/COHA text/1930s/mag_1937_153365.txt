" A university president who . . . lives and acts plainly will answer our purposes far better . " <P> That statement , uttered early in the proceedings by Chairman Harold M. Wilkie. seemed to express the basic point of Governor Philip La Follette of Wisconsin , whose board of regents met last week in Madison to vote finally on the dismissal of Glenn Frank as president of the University of Wisconsin . All but four of the 15 regents had been appointed by Governor La Follette . When nine of them voted for an open hearing on Chairman Wilkie 's charges against him , filed at last month 's regents ' meeting ( TIME , Dec. 28 ) , Dr. Frank knew he had only a slim chance of retaining the $15,000 job he had held for eleven years . <P> Harold Wilkie is a determined 46-year-old Madison lawyer . Hour after hour for two days he read and debated the 18,000-word bill of particulars that was to oust the best-known State university president in the land . According to Wilkie . Glenn Frank had miserably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had permitted last spring 's squabble between Athletic Director Walter Meanwell and Football Coach Clarence Spears to develop into a " public mess , " had neglected his University responsibilities for too frequent lecturing outside Wisconsin , writing daily syndicated newspaper articles which had made him more than $100,000 . <P> If Governor La Follette , through his regents , found President Frank remiss and inefficient , President Frank found Governor La Follette sordidly partisan , politically biased , dangerously dictatorial . ' ' Certain forces in Wisconsin " he rebutted , " want a Fascist kind of university administration . ' ' Patiently diagramming educational statistics which the fidgeting regents did not want to hear , he defended his decade 's record at Wisconsin , cited higher enrollments , higher average graduate accomplishments in the professions . His newspaper writing , said Glenn Frank , occupied only three hours a week and forced him to broaden his reading : speaking outside the State , once a month on the average , brought invaluable contacts among alumni , industrial and educational leaders , which any university president required . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty as president . " declared he . <P> Aghast at the whole affair , President Anton J. Carlson of the American Association of University Professors , a University of Chicago physiologist who was on hand as A.A.U.P. s unofficial witness , exploded : " I have not hoped to live to see this kind of meeting . . . . The important thing is not Dr. Frank but the statement by Mr. Wilkie that governors always have insisted upon having a hand in the selection of presidents of State universities . ... I could imagine such a thing happening only in the early days of the Russian revolution by a committee of soldiers and peasants . It has happened here . " As twilight of the hearing 's second day descended over the campus . Glenn Frank had only a few more hours as Wisconsin 's president . After recessing for a late dinner , the 15 regents returned at 9:25 p. m. to act on Regent Gates 's resolution to remove Glenn Frank and appoint Dean George C. Sellery as temporary president .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
