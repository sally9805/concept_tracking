him seem to inhale with pleasure the somewhat powerfulodors of Roscoff ; it may have been the stout cane held so carelessly beneath the arm of his light blue coat that gave him his air of harmless affability ; but whatever it was that did it , there was that about him which drew a tolerant growl from the swarthy Frenchmen who sat along the basin 's rim , scratching themselves and looking resentfully at the cloudlesssky . Moving thus in an atmosphere of honesty and good cheer , Slade eyed a tall and narrow tavern fronting on the basin  --  a tavern whose signboard was blazoned with a round red object bearing a faint resemblance to the face of King George III , together with the words " Biftek Rouge . " What Slade saw appeared to please him ; for he swaggered jauntily through the door of the Biftek Rouge into a long room so full of men and of smoke as to give the impression that the floor itself was smoldering , and the men attempting to preventa fire by sitting on it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood by the small counter at the entrance , surveying the occupants , the buzzing died away and was succeeded by a heavy silence . Slade laughed and cocked his eye at the fat woman in black who sat knitting behind the counter . " Brandy , madame , " he said , smiling blandly at her small black mustache . " Fine de la maison . " He fumbled in the breast pocket of his coat and brought out a slip of paper . " You savez cet homme ici  --  Capitaine Henry Potter ? Pottaire , eh ? " The mustached woman set a bottle and a tumbler before him ; then studied the paper , front and back , without emotion . From a near-by table , a French sailor , gold earrings dangling on his cheeks and a canvas petticoat over his breeches , lurched forward to the counter and spoke quicklyp101to the fat woman , who looked noncommittal , raised her shoulders to the level of her ears , and passed the slip of paper to him . The Frenchman stared at it , scratching his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that name means nothing in Roscoff . " Slade motioned to the fat woman for another tumbler , filled it for the Frenchman ; then sighed and pondered , his lids downcast in vague regret . " Too bad ! " he said . " Too bad ! My friend Captain Chater told me Henry Potter worked regularly between Roscoff and Plymouth , and would set me across . " " You know Chater ? " the Frenchman asked . He swallowedhalf his tumbler of brandy , shivered violently , and stared hard at Slade out of watery eyes . " I knew him , " Slade said . " He had the fever in FernandoPo . The damned fool would n't close his ports at night . " The Frenchman grunted . " Fernando Po ! " he growled . " That is another thing , then ! Strange Englishmen are not welcome in this town , but men from Fernando Po " Slade drew papers from his pocket , and as he waited for the Frenchman to examine them , he heard the humming and buzzing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frenchman pushed back the papers . " Yes , I will tell you . You know about Dunkirk ? " Slade shook his head . " The Emperor Napoleon , he has turned over a section of the city to the English free traders , so that our poor countrymay take a few millions from the rich Goddams . All the time there are in that port five hundred sailors from across the ditch "  --  he jerked his head toward the Channel  --  " and if you go there , I think you find Pottaire . " He finished his brandy , shivered again and pulled pensively at an earring.  | " It 's too far , " Slade said . " Anyway , those that run out of Dunkirk would n't be going so far west as Devon ; they 'd be for Kent and Sussex . It 's Plymouth I 'm for . " Seemingly lost in thought , the Frenchman sniffed at the brandy bottle and pushed it toward the fat woman in black . " This Cousin Jacky is for export to England , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lest it eat a hole . Give us a measure from the keg of ' 97 . " Grumbling , the mustached woman produced a second bottle , from which the Frenchman poured two half tumblers . " And , " Slade reminded him , " I want to come back the same way in four days . I thought I 'd pay in advance on this side , and leave the return money with madame here , to be paid when I come in again  --  paid with a hundred-franc bonus . " The Frenchman put an arm around Slade 's shoulders and breathed heavily on his neckcloth . " All , but this is somethingwe arrange at once . I am arrive here this morning , and I do not go back for four days , because every Englishman in the world either carries lace and Cousin Jacky , or wishes to buy it ! There is the English of it for you ! They make a law ; then all of them work day and night to break it ! Now there are so many of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other in mid-Channel ! It is a hard thing for poor France that so many English should take the bread out of our mouths , no ? " He patted Slade 's shoulder and seemed to weep a little . " It 's tonight I want to go to Plymouth , " Slade said . " Yes , yes ! But not Plymouth ! Polperro , Yealm , Dartmouth , Cawsand , Looe  --  yes ; every night there are luggers to those places , but not to Plymouth . Plymouth , it is too full of war vessels . Listen now to me . Here is what we do : To/night four luggers go to Whitesand Bay , between Looe and Plymouth  --  two English and two French . I send you with an Englishman  --  Captain Vincent , cutter Lottery ; he is very intelligent man . If there is something to be found out "  --  he raised his eyebrows suggestively  --  " by those fools in the army who are forever studying and daily growing stupider , Captain Vincent , he will deliver even a general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You go with him to Whitesand Bay tonight and be nicely in Plymouth for breakfast ; then in four days you come with a friend of Captain Vincent to Whitesand Bay once more , and we returnhere like two larks . " The cutter Lottery , laden with one hundred ankers of cognac , five hundred pounds of tea , seven thousand yards of lace and thirty bales of silk , ran due north from Roscoff on the night tide ; and Captain Vincent , nursing the tiller of his swift vessel as easily with one hand as though he navigateda ship 's dinghy in a canal , held Slade 's gold pieces to the dim light of the binnacle ; then stuffed them into the pocket of his breeches and cast a quick glance under the mainsail . " You came to the wrong place for a Plymouth vessel , " he told Slade , staring at him innocently out of clear blue eyes , " and if you was n't a stranger , you 'd ' a ' knowed it . It takes money to shut up the Excise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay off a dozen revenue-cruiser captainsto boot ; and us little fellers , we ai n't got it . It 's only the big Scotch and French and Dutch and English companiesthat can pay that high for protection ; and if we nose in on their preserves , it 's a knife in the ribs or a bullet in the back , like as not , for those of us as does . "  | He spat over the side . " Of course , them that has to make port in all weathers , maybe they need protection ; but WhitesandBay is all I need ; no questions asked and labor plenty . You 'll see ' em turn out tonight , with four vessels unloading ! We pay ' em well ; and every farmer and shopkeeper and blacksmith in the town , they 'll be out to help ; yes , and the women and children and the parson . And why should n't they , when it comes to that ? What right 's a government got to say a poor man sha' n't have his tot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " It 's all the same to me where I land , " Slade said , " so long as nobody throws me into jail for being American . Going on an errand of mercy , the way I am , I would n't want to be branded as an enemy and all that . " He laughed . " I 'm no more an enemy of England than you 're an enemy of France , but we 'd both be hard put to it if it came to explaining ! " Captain Vincent nodded , gazing round-eyed at Slade . " Aye , " he said , " I was thinking the same . It 's likely you 'd have no trouble , with your head cocked up on account of your eye , and so looking important and mean , like an Englishgentleman . It 's likely you would n't ; only there 's no telling  --  there 's no telling . " He brooded for a time . Then : " You said it was Bristol you were making for ? " he asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , " Slade said . Captain Vincent nodded . " If I was you , I 'd make sure . Better be safe than sorry , ' specially if you can enjoy yourselfdoing it . It 'll cost some money , but you 'll find it 'll be worth it , more ways than one  --  that is , unless you got objections to traveling around with a young female . " " It depends some on the female ! " Slade tilted back hisCAPTAIN CAUTION 105 Ip105head to look at Vincent , and his teeth , as he laughed , were tight together , so that his laughter had more the sound of soft and eager breathing than of mirth . " Well , I tell you , " Vincent said , " this female 's all right . She 's young and she 's sensible looking . Nothing flash about her , see ; nothing to set people watching her all the time ; nothing that 'd oblige you to be fighting some young buck every few minutes to keep him from trying to cut her out ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any female ever I see ! Now , if you should get this female and take her around as your wife , she 'd do all the talking , and nobody 'd suspect you of not being an Englishman . Most Englishmen act tongue-tied when they 're with their wives , anyway . " Slade cleared his throat . " I 've had the same idea in mind for some time , " he said frankly , " but I thought of visiting a house of entertainment where I could make a selection , I 'm a little particular about my women . " " I 'll tell you how it is , " Vincent continued quickly . " There 's plenty of females in Plymouth and Portsmouth and every other port nowadays , what with the men of the fleet to take care of , and the regular run of trade , and prisonerscoming in to be looked after ; but I tell you right now , you have to watch out for yourself ! There 's plenty in Portsmouththat 'll stay with a prisoner fresh aboard a receiving hulk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two shillings for a full night 's work ; but you know what happens if you take up with one like that ! " Slade laughed , a hoarse and racking laugh . " Yes , " Vincent went on , " but this female , she 's nothing like that ! There 's admirals that 've enjoyed associating themselves with this female , and have n't hardly been able to waitp106to get back off their stations so they could get hold of her society again . Admirals ! " The two of them chuckled . " How 's it sound to you ? " Vincent asked . " Not bad ! " Slade said . " Not bad , provided she does n't get to thinking I 'm made of money . How much would I have to pay her ? " " I 'll tell you how it is , " Vincent said . " There was a few of us fitted up two houses in Plymouth  --  not the regular run , but high-class houses of entertainment . Some of the females we brought over from France for entertaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was brought "  --  they chuckled again  --  " and some we found closer home ; but they 're all of ' em ladies , fit to be presented at Court , or to spend a week visiting in Buckingham Palace . Now , if this female goes stepping off with you , it hurts the profits , as you might say ; so you 'd better pay me enough to cover that end of it , and then you can fix up with her . Maybe she 'd come too high for you . Whenever she puts in considerable time entertaining a gentleman , she has to have two new dresses , one for day and one for night , and five guineas a day . Too much , ai n't it ? " " Well , " Slade said , clearing his throat , " if she 's as shrewd as you claim , she might be worth it . How much would cover the profits ? " " Oh , call it five guineas , " Vincent said carelessly . Again Vincent examined gold pieces in the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lurching and swaying cockpit , he whispered busily in Slade 's ear until , dead ahead , a score of blinking , wavering lights marked the tumbled rocks and the sheltered crescent beach of Whitesand Bay.  | THE office of Admiral Sir John Duckworth , high above the dockyard at Devonport , looked out over the bewildering marine activities of the Hamoaze to the lofty wooded slopes of Mount Edgcumbe , beyond which lay Whitesand Bay ; and Admiral Duckworth himself , stocky and formal in his high-collared uniform coat and spotless nankeen breeches , stared from the window at the swarming waters below , in which shore boats , bumboats , ships ' boats , and lighters of every description scurried like beetles among the frigates , line-of-battle ships , hulks , ships repairing , ships fittingand ships under sail . Behind him , the hoarse voice of Captain Slade filled the room with a ceaseless and not displeasinghum . Admiral Duckworth turned from the window suddenly . " As I understand it , " he interrupted , " you want one-half of the sum realized from the condemnation sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from some port unknown . I tell you at once , my good fellow , it wo n't do ! It 's too much ! " Slade shrugged his shoulders . " That 's as you see fit , Admiral . " He coughed . " I 've heard there are ways in which vessels are ships when they enter your prize courts and sloops when they come out  --  though , of course , that 's none of my affair . And I know your prize money is often divided oddly . Why , I know a case , and so do you , too , sir , where a British admiral received four thousand pounds prize money from a single vessel , while the seamen on his ship were givenp108two pounds apiece . Of course , that 's none of my affair either , but it 's been done , and done often , where your admiralswere concerned ; and what 's been done can be done again . " Admiral Duckworth stared at him coldly , but Slade only laughed . " It seems to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some slight difference , too . Here 's a vessel that will be fitted out as a privateer against you , under a Yankee captain that  --  meaning no offense  --  can sail circles around your fastest frigates and sloops-of-war . It seems to me it should be a privilege for you to nip this little enterprise in the bud , no matter how much it costs you  --  a privilege and a patriotic duty . " " Dear me ! " the admiral said in a light voice . " Lessons in patriotism to a British admiral delivered by a Yankee merchantcaptain whose position is  --  let us say  --  equivocal ? Interesting ! " Slade tilted back his head and smiled up into the red face above him . " Do n't take me wrong , Admiral ! Do n't take me wrong ! It only seemed to me I ought to mention the saving to your country , seeing that you 've objected to my reasonableprice for the information . Why , here , Admiral ; this barque and her cargo will sell for thirty thousand pounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if you send a schooner to cut her out , her officers and crew would consider themselves made men if they divided five thousand among ' em . There 's ten thousand left for government . Or call it five thousand , and make a fast sloop-of-war out of the barque . All profit , Admiral ! But if you do n't get her , what then ? Suppose she slips out and takes four or five of your merchantmen , as she will ! As she will ! "  |p109Slade  clicked his teeth together and laughed his soft laugh that sounded like quick strokes of a brush against stone . " You 'll have the shipowners buzzing around the Admiralty 's ears , crying for their lost money and cursing the navy for a kettle of old goats and younger sons , and that 's all you will have ! " Duckworth walked up and down the room , glancing angrily at Slade . " It 's beyond me ! " he said at length . " I 've done some righting against your people in my time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was our people that went running over to yours , because of all your wild talk of freedom ; but here you are , wanting to sell your own shipmates ! " Slade seemed hurt . " No , no ! You 've got it hindside foremost , Admiral ! The barque belongs to a poor , helpless girl with no mind for business . She 's fallen into the hands of two unscrupulous rascals , Admiral . If they have their way , it 'll be no time at all before the girl 's stripped clean and deserted in a foreign port . They 'll take her barque for a privateer , and they 'll take her money from her on the plea of refitting . It 's that , Admiral , that 's set me off on this . I do ! late to see an innocent maid so fooled and misled . " The admiral looked at him and laughed . Slade sighed softly and rose from his chair , smiling somewhatruefully . " Well , " he said , " it 's no matter ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hat in hand , he moved toward the door . " Half a moment , " Duckworth ordered . " If we go in after this barque , are you sure she wo n't be tied up at a dock ? Wo n't be unloaded ? Are you sure a cutting-out expedition ould get to her ? " Slade set his gray beaver hat on the floor once more . " Ip110saw a French official before I came away . She 'll be held at anchor , and wo n't break cargo until I return ; and she 'll cut out as easy as a rat hole out of cheese . " " Well , " Duckworth said reluctantly , " we might arrange it . " Slade eyed the admiral thoughtfully , his drooping eyelid a pallid patch in his swarthy face . " You wo n't regret it ! No : you wo n't regret it ! And by the way , Admiral : there 's one or two things I 'd like to be sure of before the matter 's consideredsettled . There 'd have to be articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the prize money resulting from the sale of the barque and her cargo , whose value is tentatively estimated at thirty thousand pounds ; and that in case she 's used for government service , I 'm further to receive one-half of her value as decided by the prize court . Also an agreement that when the barque is cut out , the lady , if aboard , is to be set ashore before putting to sea . Also an agreement that the crew shall be taken for imprisonmentto the hulks farthest removed from the port where the barque was captured . They 're dangerous men , Admiral , and I want ' em put where there 's no likelihood they 'll cause the lady more trouble . " " Dear me ! Dear me ! " Grumbling , the admiral dropped down before his desk and scratched busily on a sheet of paper , while Slade watched him out of one black eye that seemed to glitter like a drop of ink in the sun . The next morning this benevolent adventurer sat at an upper window of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his newly varnished boots . He cocked an eye at the curving streets of ancient Bristol and thep111forest of masts that edged the serpentine curves of the Avon as willows rim the banks of a meadow brook . " Interesting , is n't it ! " he said in his hoarse voice . " These English ; they know how to do things ! They put up a battery of church towers to catch your eye ; and while you 're busy looking at the towers , they run their slave ships right up to their own back doors . " He laughed the laugh that had the sound of bristles passinglightly over granite ; then turned his head quickly . " Look here , my love ! I 've got business in this town , and I want you with me ! Crowd on some canvas or you 'll get something you are n't looking for ! " A small , brown-eyed , brown-haired girl came to his side , circled his head with a bare arm , rapped him lightly on the cheek with the back of a hairbrush and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , " do n't tease ! " She broke from him and went back to her prinking at a mirror ; and Slade , watching her with a gleaming eye , was silent . It was an hour later that the captain swaggered proudly from the narrow door of the Swan , his snakewood cane jauntily a-swing and at his side his lady , her small hand thrust demurely beneath his elbow ; her eyes , sheltered by a snuff-brown bonnet , modestly cast down . It scarcely seemed that she could muster the courage to leave the side of her escort to ask even the smallest of questions of a stranger ; but leave it she did ; and while her apparent husband stood lost in admiration of the Norman tower of St. Peter 's Church , she timidly begged a white-aproned wine merchant to direct them to Queens Square . Then the decorous couple skirted the busy Avon , passed through the odors of wine , tobacco and leather that hung over the crowded High Street , and made their way intop112the quiet southern quarter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipowners were sheltered on three sides by the waters of the Floating Harbor . Here , while Captain Slade again seemed stricken speechless by the cold bronze scrutiny of King William III and his horse , or possiblyby the sight of either the customhouse or the jail , his gentle companion hesitatingly inquired of a lofty footmanwhere the residence of Sir Austin Braymore might be found . It was not , indeed , until these two obviously estimable and virtuous folk had been admitted to the dim hallway of Sir Austin 's home that Captain Slade regained his tongue ; and the very manner of his regaining it was proof that he was pleased . " Little devil ! " he said , drawing his lady to him . " Every inch the bride ! We came here as neatly as though we 'd been brought up on the smell of fried eels ! " He peered past her at the elaborately carved love seat in the hall ; then raised his chin , as if in haughty appraisal , to eye the cabinet in the near-by reception room  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pagoda , rising to eaves that swept upward to still higher eaves , and thence to a stork at the top ; a stork so graceful and so lifelikethat it seemed poised above the cabinet , rather than mounted on it . Inside the cabinet were silver bowls and jars ( and milky plates , their centers blazing with heraldic designs in gold and blue and scarlet . He bent his head to whisper close to the snuff-brown bonnet : " Make an excuse and stay out here . I 'll see this gentleman alone ; and after that , my love , I 'll set you to playing the dear , fresh-wed little spouse once more . " A portly gentleman with a triple row of chins camep113heavily down the staircase , wrinkling his forehead at the couple below him . " Captain Slade and ma'am , " he said politely . " The name is not  --  is not -- Captain Slade seemed almost to stand on tiptoe , so far back did he throw his head to see Sir Austin clearly . " I came direct from Admiral Duckworth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so ! " Sir Austin murmured . " From Sir John ! So , so ! Pray step back here , Captain . " He turned toward the far end of the hall , but before Captain Slade could follow him , his lady had swayed and gasped a little , and to the distress of Sir Austin and the captain , declared timidly and sweetly that the journey had been a thought too much for her : that she would sit alone , here in the hall , if only Sir Austin would have the kindness to send a servant to her with a thimble of Madeira . " Of Bristol milk , ma'am ! Not Madeira , but Bristol milk ! That 's the wine to bring the color back to those soft cheeks ! " He hurried to the bell pull , hastened for the smelling salts and bustled about for a cushion to slip beneath the feet of this delicate little lady ; so that when he was finally alone with Captain Slade in the small white-walled room at the rear of the house , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheezed a little as he sat wideleggedbefore his visitor in a large wing chair . " So , so ! " he panted . " From Sir John ! Ha-ha ! Difficult post ! Happy to think he thought of me ! " The quick rasp of Captain Slade 's laugh brought a look of puzzlement to Sir Austin 's face . " It just happened , " Slade murmured , " that your name did n't come up . No , your name was n't even mentioned . " Sir Austin clapped his fat hands on his knees and staredp114in amazement . " Not even  --  not even Then to what , ifI may ask , am I indebted -- Slade turned his head and looked hard at Sir Austin from his one good eye . " Some little time before I saw Sir John , I ran into Fernando Po . " He nodded brightly and added , " On business . " Sir Austin cleared his throat softly . " On business in Fernando Po ? That is in Africa , is it not ? " Slade laughed a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was there , and that the Venus had cleared with six hundred and nine blacks three weeks before , you ought to know where Fernando Po is ! " He looked coolly about the small white room ; got up , even , to scrutinize more closely the lady in the gown of shimmering brown whose portrait hung above a mantel of yellow marble  --  a mantel with a medallion chiseled by a master hand to show a dog , bone in mouth , staring at his reflection in a stream . " H 'm ! " Slade said . " Lady , by Kneller '  --  best man you 've got when it comes to white shoulders above a silk dress ! " He sat down again and grinned into Sir Austin 's still face . " What happened , " he continued , " was that Chater would n't close his ports at night . That 's what you get for taking a man off the Channel and putting him on the Middle Passage . They know it all , they do , just because they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handful of paid Preventive officers . Wo n't take advice ! That was Chater ! Would n't take advice ! I told him what would happen if he did n't keep his ports shut , but he laughed , and it occurred ! " Slade hissed jovially through his clenched white teeth , " He died of the fever . "  |p115Sir  Austin drew a key from his pocket and fumbled , with helpless hands , at the lock of a mahogany cellarette that stood by his elbow . Slade leaned forward to take the key from the trembling fingers of his host . With a deferential smile he thrust it into place and raised the lid . " Permit me , " Slade said . He glanced mournfully at Sir Austin . " Your health , I fear , is not what it should be . It 's the rich food , perhaps . Yes , it must be the rich food ! A man your age ca n't be too careful about avoiding exertion or excitement . What can I give you , sir ? " " Brandy ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Slade brought up a bottle with a fly-specked label , turned his head sidewise to examine it ; then , puckering his lips in a tuneless whistle , he plucked two glasses from the rack . When he had filled one for Sir Austin , he sipped from his own , sighing gently as he rolled the liquor over his tongue . " You 'll be relieved to know , " he at length continued , seeing that Sir Austin seemed content to sit silently , staring into his empty glass , " that I saved her for you . Yes , sir ; I saved the Narcissus ! When Chater was dying , the blacks rose , and if I had n't been handy with a long knife , you would n't have any Narcissus . You 'd have lost her , and everything with her  --  men , sails , spars , coppers and leg irons . " He shook his head reproachfully at Sir Austin . " You ought to give your niggers more space ! There were ninety packed into the boys ' room , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's not enough  --  not for vessels as slow as your English tubs . Fifty days they take for the Middle Passage ! You 're bound to lose half of ' em when you pack ' em in like that ! Sometimes it seems as though you English did n't have any sense at all ! It 's a wonder to me you 're able to lay up a penny ! Instead of suffocating so many , why do n't you carry forty-five instead of ninety in your boys ' room ? They 'd cost half as much , and you 'd have next to no losses unless you struck bad weather . " " You do n't know --  " Sir Austin 's voice failed him , so that he was forced to try again : " You do n't know what you 're saying ! " He worked his lips from side to side , as if to free them of stiffness . " I wo n't listen to such things ! I do n't know what you 're talking about ! " " No , " Slade said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bottle from the cellarette and poured himself another brandy , As an afterthought he offered the bottle to Sir Austin , who seemed not to see it . " I suppose , " Slade continued , " you also do n't know what I 'm talking about when I mention the Narcissus or the Venus or the Delight or the Apollo ! Since you merely happen to own ' em , you naturally would n't have heard of ' em , or of what they 're doing . That being so , I 'll be glad to furnish you with something authentic . You 'll doubtless be happy to hear the Delight landed four hundred and eighty blacks at St. Thomas on her last voyage , along with three tons of gum copal and twenty-two hundred double pawn cloths . That ought to mean fifteen thousand pounds in your pocket  --  fifteen thousand in addition to your profits in  --  ah  --  black ivory from the other three ! Why , I doubt there 's another slave trader in Bristol who can hold a candle to your fortune ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat white cheeks seemed to be afflicted with spasms of trembling , as jelly shudders at a weighty footstep ; and for a time they sat in silence , these two ; Sir Austin clutching at his knees with plump white hands that shook and sweated ,  |p117and  Slade grinning up at the white shoulders of the girl in the portrait above the mantel . Sir Austin , when he stirred , moved with the stiffness of a wooden man . His eyes were dull as those of a dead haddock . " Never ! " he gasped . " It 's not so ! I deny it ! " Slade stroked his long black hair with the palm of his hand . " Before Chater died , " he said , " I thought it might ease his mind to sign a writing for his family showing he was n't in that business for himself . It mentioned he was working for you ; and then  --  blast my absent-mindedness !  --  if I did n't go and forget to give that paper to the widow ! " His eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix up poor old Chater 's reputation , I 've arranged that the writing shall be presented to Admiral Sir John Duckworth and other responsible officials on a certain date unless  --  un-less Sir Austin rolled almost drunkenly in his huge wing chair .

He might have been crazed by the fever ! Crazed ; yes , yes ! Crazed ! This damned calumny  --  why , my daughter  --  but there 's no one would believe such a slander -- What ? Of a man that put a window in St. Margaret'sand that bishops are damned glad to dine with ? " " Dear , dear ! " Slade said carelessly . " I fear the bishops may be upset when they learn they 've been dining with the owner of slave ships ! " He rose to scan again the portrait of the girl in brown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I take it ; but probably her position would n't be affected by anything that happened to you  --  ah  --  would it , Sir Austin ? "  | Sir Austin pressed his hands together . " The jail 's just across the square , Captain Slade , and the sheriff 's a friend of mine ! I might warn you to have a care how you speak loosely of me in Bristol , or elsewhere . Do you think any man in Bristol could be brought to believe that Slade waved his hand languidly . " And would they never believe it of such good Bristol citizens as Standish Trevor and Sir George Batt and Cottrell and Foster Penhallow ? " Sir Austin 's breath made faint popping sounds as it broke from his slack lips , and Slade 's eye gleamed with satisfaction . " They 're on the list , " he said suavely . " Those names are there with yours , and the names of their vessels as well . " He cleared his throat . " You 're slow to make laws , you British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em too severe , to my way of thinking ! Of course , we 've got a law against importing slaves into America  --  had it before you made your law , because of the way you were glutting our markets with blacks  --  but our law 's nothing like as strong as the law you passed last year . " With his tongue he made clicking noises of commiseration . " To think it 's a felony in England since last year ! A felony to deal in dirty blacks , when everybody knows your cane fields ca n't be properly cultivated by anyone but niggers ! Yes , sir ; a felony , and punishable with transportation ! Why , sir , it just does n't seem within the bounds of reason that if that document should fall into Duckworth 's hands , you 'd be torn from your family and that daughter of yours , and transported to Botany Bay along with common thieves and drunkards and diseased women !

" I suppose you want something . " Slade drew from his pocket the paper he had received from Admiral Duckworth , glanced closely at it , and handed it to Sir Austin . " I want two things , " he said , " and consideringI saved the Narcissus for you , it 's little enough . I want fifteen thousand pounds advanced on that piece of paper , and I want a vessel . I want the fifteen thousand pounds in cash , and I want it tomorrow . And when I say I want a vessel , I do n't mean any vessel . I mean a brig , a fast brig  --  a fast armed brig . She 's got to have fourteen guns at least , and two of them long guns  --  long 24 's . She 's got to have quarters for a crew of -a hundred and forty , and she 's got to be trim and taut and ready for sea . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the word as if it burned his tongue . " Why , where would I get such a sum and such a brig ? How could I Slade fixed his one good eye on him fiercely . " I 've made myself clear , " he said . " That 's what I want and that 's what I propose to have ! You know it 's worth that to you and Penhallowand Cottrell and Trevor and Batt to be saved from Botany Bay ! You can tell them for me they 're on the list , and the list will be in Duckworth 's hands if I do n't get what I want  --  the money tomorrow and the brig within a month . You know as well as I do that Liverpool has enough fast brigs hidden away to fight every sloop-of-war in the British Navy ! Where would you get it , indeed ! Who should know better than you that there were two hundred and fifty slave brigs out of Liverpool less than ten years ago ? Two hundred and fifty ! Go there and get one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the influence ! You own slave . ships , and Liverpool was built on the profits of the slave trade . A manp120of your influence can get whatever he wants in Liverpool ! " His laugh was like the rubbing together of two bricks . " Does n't the sheriff come here to dinner ? Do n't you have bishops to dine ? " . . . When at last Captain Slade emerged from Sir Austin Braymore 's small white-walled study , triumphantly rolling his glittering black eye from the Turkey carpets on the floor to the silver in the great pagoda cabinet , his modest little lady was asleep on the love seat in the hall , the tips of her brown slippers barely reaching to the floor and her lips parted as innocently and sweetly , in her childlike slumber , as the petals of a rose . She opened her eyes as he gazed down at her ; then , after a cloudy moment , recognition came back to her . " You 've a sweet man , " she said  --  " a sweet man to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear , I was n't , " Slade told her as she rose and they moved toward the door . " I was smiling to myself to think how vastly I bettered myself in so short a time . Five days  --  why , it 's genius ! "  | BY FIVE DAYS Captain Slade meant the five since he had left the Olive Branch in the harbor of Morlaix , where that patient barque still lay with all her cargo , and a great deal of perplexity aboard her . There were times when Marvin , eager to break bulk and see the cargo of the Olive Branch safe ashore , fell into such a rage that he talked bitterly to Argandeau . " What 's the matter with these Frenchmen ? " Marvin demanded . " The crew of the Formidable went ashore long ago , and the English wounded have been safely put in jail , God help ' em , so that we 're harmless enough ; and we 've shaken hands with a hundred officials and officials ' clerks , and Corunnaspends half her time on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and we 've paid money to every soul in Morlaix , I do believe ! Everyone except the priest and the schoolmaster ! Yet every day they think up another reason why our goods must stay under hatches ! Why , they 're worse than the Chinese , these Frenchmen ! " Argandeau raised his shoulders helplessly . " No , no ! " he said . " You do not understand them . They have had many years of war , and many years of democracy , when every man claimed to be as good as every other man , but privately knew himself to be better ; and now they have Bonaparte and a dozen spies to watch each one of them , so they must be careful , poor people . " " Careful ! " Marvin exclaimed . " Do you call a thief care- ful when he makes you turn out the same pocket twenty times ? " " Eh , eh ? " Argandeau cried . " Thief ' is a strong word ! The trouble is merely that some important man has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , to tell us what he wants ; or perhaps he is waiting to find out what all the others have received from us , so that he may be certain he will not receive less than any man . " " A body 'd think , " Marvin told him , " that we were their enemies , instead of helping them to fight the English . Do n't they ever say what they mean ? Are they always bowing and smiling and talking about friendship , and then doing everything they can to ruin us , like your idiot Admiral D'Estaing who talked so loud about helping us whip Englandin the Revolution ? " Argandeau examined him calmly . " I think you are excited , dear Marvin . It is true that D'Estaing was not a lion in battle and was something of a hen as a seaman , but if I had been in his boots , I would have won that little war for your thick-skulled countrymen in two weeks  --  maybe three . " Marvin reached over and caught Argandeau by the shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that it is so , my dear friend ! How much easier it will be , then , for you to win an even smaller war with people even more thickskulled ! " Argandeau lifted his eyebrows . " What is this you say , dear Marvin ? " " Go ashore ! " Marvin exclaimed . " Go ashore and tell Corunnato stop signing papers ; that you 'll arrange this thing ! We must make a start at landing this cargo today ! I tell you I do n't like lying here with no way of maneuvering , and not enough crew to fight off any gang of frog eatersp123that takes a fancy to come aboard . I do n't feel easy . There 's a change coming ! If you 're as good as you think you are , go ashore and make these Frenchmen stop squabbling over their pennies long enough to let us tie up to a dock and get our goods on land . Tell ' em we want less politeness and more friendliness . " Argandeau elevated his shoulders . " But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we are rude to them ; and I am sure that when our little rabbit returns , she will have the permission to begin tomorrow or the next day to unload . " " So that 's what you think , Admiral , " Marvin inquired , with an exaggerated air of urbanity . " I scarcely knew you at first , but now you 've finished speaking , I recognize the D'Estaing accent . How well I remember your skill at doing nothing , Admiral , when we needed help the most ! " Argandeau laughed softly . " Be quiet ! " he said . " That tongue of yours , it is too busy ! I 'll do what you want ! I 'll see that rabbit of ours at the Hotel de Ville in ten minutes and tell her I arrange to do what you wish , but only do it to save myself from the clacking of your voice . " Marvin watched him being rowed ashore . " Do not look so serious ! " Argandeau shouted back to him . " Argandeau , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , eh , and tonight we have fried eels and two bottles of brandy  --  maybe three ! I bring them back with me ! " The boat moved in toward the wharves of Morlaix and the dismal-looking buildings of gray stone that rose steeply above them . Marvin , confident that Argandeau , brought at last to the point of speaking his mind to his countrymen , would be successful in his mission , went forward to the bow , where those that were left of the crew were dividing their time between the catching of eels and the exchange of hoarse pleasantries with the occupants of small boats engaged in the sale of onions , checked shirts , flatfish , apple brandy , red wine , lace and mussels . With reluctance they abandoned their fishing , removed the hatch and fell to swaying bales on deck in preparation for the afternoon 's unloading . Marvin , having put them to work , inspected the galley and the forecastle , examined the guns with a mind to having them scraped and repainted ; then , still with the thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin to look for spots that would be better for a brushful . The cabin was divided into two sections , and it was the smaller of these that Corunna still occupied . At its door Marvin hesitated , but only for a moment . There seemed to him , when he entered , to be something of Corunna about this small white room with its standing bedplace and its wide lockers  --  an air of sturdiness and crispness . Drawn over the bedplace was a patchwork quilt that almost glittered in the brilliance of its colors , and folded neatly on it lay her needlework  --  that worsted work of art representing the Holy Family gazing with suspicion at the towers of Jerusalem . Marvin , touching it gingerly with his forefinger , smiled a little . From it there seemed to rise a faint fragrance of sweet grass and mallow , such as had come to him so often from the Arundel meadows on summer nights . He stared up at the ceiling and around at the white panels of this neat small cabin ; then moved to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Chinese courting mirror over it , and a swinging whale-oil lamp of pewter and copper , with small paintings of her mother and father on either side. ,  |p125The  painting of her mother , Marvin thought , would be Corunna to the life if , in place of the low black dress , edged at the neck with wooden-seeming lace , the portrait showed her in a stained and darned Chinese jacket with a collar that came high up around her throat and fastened with three jade buttons . He slipped the oval frame from its hook . Through the tightly drawn black hair gleamed a white ear tip ; the lips seemed to tremble on the verge of a smile ; in the smooth column of the throat , as Marvin studied it , there was almost the beating of a pulse . He touched the pictured throat gently with his finger . The scent of sweet grass and mallow came to him again ; and the face at which he looked softened and became charming , as had Corunna 's on that night off Rio , He lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he guiltily raised his eyes to his reflection in the mirror . Reflected also in the mirror was the stern window , and through the mirrored window he saw , far down the estuary , a tall black schooner beating up on the rising tide from the Channel , close hauled on the larboard tack . He quickly hung the picture in its place , turned to the window and examined the rig and cut of the distant vessel . Despite the briskness of the southwest breeze , she rode stiff in the water , heeling over so little that no part of her copper showed , if indeed there was copper on her . She was , Marvin felt , too large for a smuggler ; and he knew , as well , that there was scarce a smuggler in either France or England but use a either a lugger or a cutter in his trade in preference to a schooner . She might , he told himself , be a French privateer ; but it was doubtful , since her top-hamper was lacking in delicacy , to his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance he could see , from the spread of her ratlines , that she carried more shrouds and backstays than Diron and Argandeau would consider needful ; and it was plain that she was rigged for strength rather than for great speed . Furthermore , she showed no colors , which seemed to him unusual for a vessel entering a home port after a cruise . Vaguely uneasy , but more curious than uneasy , he took Corunna 's telescope from the rack beside her bedplace and went on deck , where a score of bales had risen from the hold to clutter the amidships section . Increasingly uneasy , he mounted to the mizzen top and focused the glass on the schooner , which had come about on the far side of the estuary . She was pointing downstream from the Olive Branch , but from the set of the tide it appeared to Marvin that when the stranger next came about , she would be abreast of the barque . Through the glass he could see guns on her deck , which was nothing strange ; and her ports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guns , so that she looked peaceable enough . He was a fool , he told himself , to be disturbedover a harmless merchantman , running home , nc doubt , with rum and sugar from Martinico ; and with that he polished the lenses of the glass with a fold of his shirt and stared even harder at her . From far behind him he heard a hail . A boat , he saw , was bobbing toward the Olive Branch from the direction of Morlaix  --  a boat with three men in it . As he looked , the man in the stern sheets rose to his feet , pointing and waving toward the oncoming schooner , and hailed again . Marvin saw , with a faint trembling in the pit of his stomach , that the man was Argandeau . What it was that he shouted , Marvin could not hear , nor did he need to hear.  |p127His  thoughts churned in his head , like wheels spinning In butter . " If I can pile her up on shore , " he thought , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but do n't have time , I 'm making it easier to lose her . " He cast a quick glance at the schooner . To Marvin , the mile-wide estuary seemed to have shrunk in size ; the white cottages on the far shore , so distantuntil now , must , he thought , have drawn near to stare critically at him . The schooner , pushing a milky wave before her , had swelled beyond all reason . Already half across the estuary , she seemed to tower above the crinkled water like a giant among schooners . He jumped into the rigging . " All hands tumble up ! " he shouted . " Get axes ! Cut the bow anchor cable ! Cast loose the main and fore-topsail ! " He rushed , spiderlike , down the ratlines ; then leaped to the helm , putting it hard over and lashing it there . " Jib and fore-topmast staysails ! " he shouted . " Crowd ' em on ! " The waist and bow of the ship seemed alive with movementas the remaining men of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get sail on her . Slowly the gray walls and roofs of Morlaix moved to starboard ; and the tall Indian , Steven , came up over the bows , in his hand a cleaver from the galley , so that Marvin knew the bow cable had been cut . He called the Indian aft . " When they 've got sail on her , " Marvin told him , " wait till she points for the bank . Then cut the stern hawser and jam her ashore . Ram her in anywhere ! Get there ! No matter how ! " The tall Indian flicked the cleaver into the deck . It stuck there , quivering , handy to his grasp . " What is she ? A lobster box ? " Marvin shook his head and vanished down the companion- way . The Olive Branch , pushed by the southwest breeze moved slowly against the incoming tide , hesitated , as if caught on a sand bar , while the loosed sails shivered noisily but to no avail . Argandeau scrambled over the starboard bulwarks . " Haul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Never mind that schooner ! Haul ! " He looked quickly over his own shoulder . The schooner was on them -- so close that her long white jib boom had the look of threatening the reluctant barque with a lashing ; so close that Argandeau could see the moving lips of a whiskered seaman who leaned over the bows , a cutlass gripped in the fist that rested on the bulwarks . The tall Indian at the helm jumped to the taffrail , slashed the stern hawser and hurled the cleaver at the towering schooner . The Olive Branch surged sluggishly toward the brown rocks that lay a half cable 's length ahead . " Dan ! " Argandeau called . " Dan ! " Marvin burst from the companionway , spilling an armful of cutlasses on the deck . " All hands aft ! " he shouted , snatching up a cutlass . " All hands aft to stop boarders ! " " No good ! " Argandeau told him . " We do n't make it ! " " No ! " Marvin shouted . " They ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No good , dear Dan , " Argandeau repeated . " They cutus out . Look here , what they do ! " The schooner shot past the Olive Branch 's stern , veering swiftly as she did so . Her bulwarks , Marvin saw , were packed with intent red faces , and as she veered , blue-clad men in shiny black tarpaulin hats swarmed into the fore and main chains and ratlines  --  twenty of them , thirty of them.  |p129She  slipped between the Olive Branch and the haven of brown rocks . Her broad walls of canvas hung over the barque , seeming to Marvin to cut off from the Olive Branch all sun and light and air . Then she closed in ; and even while Marvin waited for the rasping lurch that must come when she laid the Olive Branch aboard , there was a growling call of " Boarders away ! " from her stern . The bulwarks of the schooner spouted men , who hurled themselves into the Olive Branch like gargantuan blue locusts . Argandeau caught Marvin 's arm as a dozen British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marvin . One went to the deck with the Indian ; the other put the wheel hard over . Over the shoulders of the Britishers , Marvin saw that his crew , taken front and rear by the English , had dropped their weapons . Four of the seamen jumped suddenly at Marvin and Argandeau . A pistol butt struck Marvin 's wrist and the cutlass fell from his hand . The blue-clad Britishers , hitherto silent , burst into uproarioustalk and laughter . " Easy as pickin ' gripes ! " one of them shouted . A sour-visaged officer , old enough to be an admiral , went to the Olive Branch 's larboard rail and hailed the schooner 's quarter-deck . " All clear , sir , " he called to an elegantly uniformed youth who stood by the schooner 's wheel . " Shall we run for the Nore ? " " What about the female ? " the youth demanded pettishly . " Bring her up where we can see her ! " The officer turned on Marvin and Argandeau . " Where 's the female that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Argandeau raised his eyebrows . " Female ? " he asked . " How does it happen you think we are supposed to have a female captain ? " The sour-faced officer took a quick step forward andp130swung the flat of his cutlass against Argandeau 's upper arm . " Where is she , you swab ? " he demanded . " She 's ashore , " Marvin said quickly . " Is Captain Slade aboard your schooner ? " " Slade ! " Argandeau cried . " Ah , my friend ! You 've hit it ! How else could these British have known we lay here worth the taking , and could be taken ? How else would they have heard we have a female captain ? Slade ! Yes ; Slade ! But we shall not find him on their schooner ! He would not risk that Argandeau , in chains , should yet find means to bite him to death ! " The sour-faced man turned to the rail to hail his youthful commander . " Ashore , sir ! They say the female captain 's ashore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's where the admiral said she was to be put ! Nice of her to save us a bit of trouble ! Sorry to miss her , in a way , what ? First American that ever did anything right , to my knowledge ! Sorry to miss a freak like that ! " His voice became crisper . " Get right along , " he called . " Take the barque to Sheerness , but not a foot farther , Cropsey . We 'll go up to Chatham to-gether . " The Olive Branch , manned by her British captors , sheered away from the schooner , which ran rapidly down the estuary ahead of them . " Nah , then , " said the sour-faced officer to Argandeau and Marvin , " we 'll just clap you and your questions abaht CaptainSlade into the cable tier ! Captain Slade , eh ? Well , if he 's one of you hole-and-corner Americans , you 'll probably meet up with him in the hulks , where all of you belong ! "  | FROM the courtyard of the Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all times a powerful odor of badly cleaned stables , venerable wine casks and cheese ; and when the sun appeared  --  as it infrequently did  --  above the chimney pots and jumbled tile roofs that surrounded the court , a singular penetrating fragrance of pickled herring rose in waves from the seemingly immaculatestone pavement of the court , and passed through the closed windows in the tavern as readily as though every window had been thrown open . Since the sun shone brightly on this clear October day , and since , as a result , the fragrance of pickled herring was strong in every room in the Queen of Scotland , but particularlystrong because of an opened window in the small fourth-floor room numbered " 44 , " it seemed strange indeed that Corunna Dorman should sit huddled in a corner of that dim and cheerless chamber , staring fixedly at a knot in the floor  --  a knot around which the soft wood had been worn away by the restless feet of countless vanished guests . From the roundness of her eyes , there seemed to be little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to see , but long minutes passed , and never once did she look up  --  not even when her black cloak , which hung in the center of a wall , moved jerkily and swayed from side to side , as if the evil spirit of the room , maddened by the smell of herring , had taken violent possession of it.  | The cloak fell at last , revealing a small hole in the wall over which it had hung ; and at its fall Corunna rose to pick it up and hang it over the hole once more . Having done so , she stood silent beside it , holding to the cloak 's hem and staring with round eyes at nothing whatever . She seemed , almost , to have lost her hearing as well as her vision , for when a light knock sounded upon her door , she still held to the cloak and stared fixedly into space . When , however , the knock was repeated and a woman 's shrill voice called , " Open , please , lady ! " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawers from before it and snapped back the bolt . The woman who entered was short and fat . Her fatness spread outward from her bust , so that her shoulders had the look of being pressed upward by it , her eyes squeezed half closed by the surge of her enormous bosom , and her vast hips and thighs spread outward by the weight they carried . She breathed heavily and peered past Corunna into the room . " You eat nothing ! Why not you come down ? I give bread and chocolat , and you need not think of monnaie  --  not yet . " " Yes , " Corunna said . " Thank you . I think  --  I think I " She stopped , swallowed hard , and contented herself with saying " Yes " once more . The fat woman pushed past her into the room , jangling a cluster of keys attached to a brass ring , and stared at the large and elaborate bed . Her half-opened mouth had the look , in that enormous face , of a sort of buttonhole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't you sleep sometime ? You do n't like this bed ? " Corunna reached out to her cloak and drew it to one side , revealing the hole beneath . " I slept in the chair . " By a movement of her eyes and upper lip , the fat womanrp133gave the impression of raising her shoulders . She went to the hole , stooped a little and squinted through it ; then , applyingher lips to the aperture , she violently shrieked a veritable explosion of syllables . When she turned back to Corunna , she wagged her head solemnly . " Nothing ! Think nothing about this ! All rooms have these holes , and all men look through ! What you expect ? " As broad and solid as a hogshead on two boulders , she stood and examined Corunna with scrupulous attention ; but Corunna , again staring wide-eyed at the protruding knot ; seemed oblivious of her presence . " You do n't know no way to get monnaie ? " she asked at length . " You do n't have no bijou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " You do n't know some friend in Paris , no ? In Boulogne ? In Lorient ? Maybe in Brest or Nantes , eh ? In Brest and Lorient come many Americans in lettres of marque . Maybe you go there , and you find a friend who take you in America , when you kiss him nice . " Corunna looked up quickly at the fat woman , opened her lips ; then closed them again and fell to staring at her clenched hands . The fat woman jingled the keys on the brass ring and dropped her voice to a confidential whisper . " Is here an avocat who is think you can get monnaie from the government in Paris because you bring wounded men here on that poor ship the dirty British had the audacity to seize from you . Eh ! What a terrible thing for our beautiful city of Morlaix that those English should be so sly and so bold as to come into our very harbor in such a manner ! Now perhaps the Emperor will give us some fortification worth something ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , poor little one ! What you need , my child , is a protector . Come , you let me speak to our avocat ! I will arrange it . You permitme to hint to him that you can be persuaded to go with him to Paris , and he will become eager . Oh , yes ! When they are old , they are easily inflamed ! " She placed a pudgy finger beside her nose and smiled craftily at Corunna . " It will be a good affair for both of us ! He is good man  --  old and kind . I think he would be gentle , and you like his protection very much . " Far below them there was the sound of a slamming door , and of a stir  --  a throbbing pulse that somehow seemed to bring new life into the stale and tainted air of this ancient tavern . The fat woman surged past Corunna and stood listening at the threshold . A burst of speech came up the darkness of the stairway , together with the noise of quick footsteps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the listening mistress of the Queen of Scotland shot through the doorway , plucked from her place by a violent hand , and where she had been stood LurmanSlade , slender and neat in his fine blue coat , his head thrown far back so that he might see clearly into the room , and a look of deep concern on his thin brown face . " Corunna ! " he cried hoarsely . " My poor Corunna ! " He went to her quickly and took her by the shoulders . " My dear ! I 've been in a torment to reach you ! If ever I 'd known He looked into her brimming eyes ; then drew her suddenlyagainst his breast , cupped her face in his hands and kissed her tenderly . She drew a deep and quivering breath , like a child whop135has borne a heavy weight of suffering ; then clung eagerly to him . " You 're here ! You 're here ! " she said . " I did n't know  --  I was afraid  --  I thought you might never come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were here , and then in a second they were gone ! " She shook her head wearily . Slade kissed her eyes and held her tight . " Never come ! " he whispered . " You thought I might never come ! I 'd have come to you across the whole world , my sweet  --  my little sweet ! " She leaned backward in his arms to stare at the walls about her . " Why , " she said , " it 's been like an awful dream ! Everything gone  --  everything swallowed up , and not a word from anyone ! Not a word ! " She shivered . Slade took her hands in his and kissed them ; then led her to the one poor chair and knelt beside her . " My heart was like lead in me when I left you , " he told her softly . " Like a stone , it was ! I could hardly eat for thinking of you ! I came to you on the instant the news reached me . With all my heart in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be your privateer , happy that I was working for you . Then , at a tavern in a little town I heard by chance of the cutting out of the Olive Branch , and thank God I did hear ! And so I am come to you ! " " Yes , " she said . " I 'm glad you 've come . I need some-body . " " Aye , " he assented gravely , " you 've needed somebody a long time , Corunna  --  somebody that could protect you from your own simple trust in people . I do n't think you yet know , " he added , " how the barque was taken . " " Why , by the British ! " she said , wondering . " They camein  | " Aye , so they did , " he agreed , looking at her pityingly . " In Roscoff it 's known how the British did it , Corunna . Aye , they know who helped to do it ! I blame myself ! What a fool I was ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear . I never dreamed he was anything but a coward  --  a sulky country coward ! He 's a cumbersome lout , half giant to the eye ; and I was simple enough to think him an honest one , all brawn and no cunning . " Corunna stared at him . " What do you say ? " " You ask me what I say , Corunna ? I say what 's incredible ; much harder for you to believe than for me , though I thought I knew him . My dear , I sha' n't blame you if you ca n't believe it . I think there was a time , before you knew me , when you liked him very well . " " Marvin ? " she whispered . " Why , yes , I did ! " Slade touched her shoulder gently ; he looked kind and wise and good . " I knew . I understood , because from the first I understood you . I knew you 'd been very close to giving your heart to him , my dear , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his character he 'd betrayed to you , you would have given it ; and so you 'd have been lost to me . Is n't that so ? " " Why , yes . " " I knew , " he said in a low voice , full of pain ; then smiled , as in a lover 's noble forgiveness . " Thank God that 's past , and you did see that defect . It 's your having seen it for yourself that makes it easier for me now to tell you how that base metal in him runs through the whole fabric of his character , so that he could do what every man in Roscoff knows he has done . " " Knows he has done " she repeated uncertainly . " Lurman , you 're telling me- " See here , " he said . " I do n't want to tell you . Do you think me a man not too proud to put a defeated rival in a false position ? " " No . " She swallowed . " But Marvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Slade burst out bitterly , as if the truth leapt from his lips despite him . " Good God ! Why , he handed over the Olive Branch to the British without a blow , either for you or for his ship ! Without a blow ! When he lay in the black hole with us , did n't he try to slip out to traffic with ' em ? I never told you this before , Corunna , but he did ! Why , you must have seen him currying favor with the commander of the Beetle , on the pretext of obtaining medicinesfor a common seaman ! Medicines ! Good God ! I do n't know what scheme he has , but you saw he was forever against anything that meant fighting the British . Oh , aye ! The dog would ever keep his record clean with them ! Forgiveme if I 'm bitter , but when I think what he 's done to you , I forget you once held him for a friend . " " To me ? " she said . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the English know just where to come and what to do ? Why , my dear , there 's not a man in Morlaix , aye , or Roscoff either , who does n't know the Olive Branch was delivered to the British by her officers  --  and for a consideration . Do you think that Marvin could n't have run the barque safe on shore if he 'd had a mind to ? Pah ! You know better yourself ! You 're too good a seaman not to know . I wish to God I 'd struck him dead at your feet , before he should have done this to you . " She rose suddenly and went to the window , where , squareshoulderedand flat-backed against the pale October sunlight , she stared down into the noisome courtyard below ,  | " How could they know ? " she asked faintly . " How could all these people know that Dan sold his soul to the English ? " Slade sighed , and his sigh seemed freighted with compassion . " Such things are always known , Corunna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my dear . " " But he did n't want to come here in the beginning ! He said the way to go home was to go home . " " Yes , " Slade assented , " and when you overruled him , he was sour and sore , and now he 's paid you for that overruling . You asked me how these people knew . Corunna dear , it 's life and death to every smuggler on the coast to know what goes on in the British Navy to the last detail ; and they do know , believe me ! They know Marvin sold the Olive Branch to the English , and they know he 'll not only get money in return but a British commission to boot . " " Ah , he would n't , " she whispered . " He 'll have a commission from them if he wants it , " Slade insisted , " and most of them here think he 'll be a wise man to take it . Aye ! They say he knows that America , with only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her thousand ships of war , so that England must win , and America be a colony of England 's once more . That being so , Marvin will not only have money but he 'll keep his lands in America , and be high in favor with the British as well . " He shook his head and cocked his eye at Corunna . " Yes , he 's a cautious man , " he reminded her . " I think I 've heard you speak of that , my dear ; but now we both know , to our cost , it was something more than caution in him . " Corunna seemed to choke , looking down into the courtyard . " No ! " she exclaimed . " No ! " Slade came close beside her . " My dear , " he said softly , " we none of us know what 's in a man 's mind , and I couldp139almost forgive him for turning against his country , if so be those are his principles . It 's what he 's done to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman more beautiful than any Queen on her throne , and with the brain of a Decatur or a Nelson  --  that 's what shows him in his true colors ! " He touched her hand gently . " To think he left you here as destitute as any beggar in the streets ! Left you here without a cent , without a ship , and , so far as he knows , without a friend ! " He turned her about , so that she faced him , and took both her hands . " Well , let him go ! It 's nothing to lose a vessel ! It 's nothing to lose money ! If I had you , there 'd be nothing in the world , no matter how poor I was , that would keep me from whatever it was you wanted and needed . " He kissed her fingers . " All my life I 've paid no attention to women , " he went on . " Now that I 've seen you and felt the touch of your hands and the softness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the rest of my days . " She smiled faintly and shook her head . " It 's so ! " he insisted . " Why , tomorrow we could set off for Paris ; and before you can have bought yourself a dozen gowns , I 'll find a way to get you a vessel , and have half of Paris at the feet of the fairest bride in all France . " His voice was that of a loving friend who brings a brave gayety to battle the despondency of his beloved . Tears seemed about to rise in his eyes  --  tears of love and pity  --  yet he smiled upon her in a valiant encouragement , and his hand came upon her shoulder with the touch of a hearty comrade . " Eh , Corunna ? We 'll up and at ' ern ! Here 's a pair of us that can took misfortune in the face . Now we 're together , not all the bad luck in the world  --  no , and not all the sneakingtreachery of those we 'd love to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not all the evil in the world can keep us down ! " Thus he swept her away.  |p141IT  WAS not discomfort that weighed heaviest on Marvin , as the violent Channel seas racked and rasped him against the harsh coils of the cable in the airless , wedge-shaped den of the cable tier , nor yet the lack of humanity in the British who had him in charge , but the almost certain knowledge that it must have been Slade who had sent His Majesty 's Schooner Sparrow to cut out the Olive Branch from the harbor of Morlaix , and the even greater certainty that Corunna , by this sudden and overwhelming disaster , had been left penniless and friendless in France , with no person to whom to turn save Slade himself . He groaned , ill at ease mentally and bodily , and prevented by the deck above from rising even to a sitting position . " You could have stayed there , " he reproached Argandeau . " You should have stayed there ! " " You think too much about this , dear Marvin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running to me in the Pre f et 's office , doing me a kindness by saying that this schooner is a Griffon  --  a Griffon who had already cut out one other vessel from Morlaix and two from under the batteries of Dunkirk , and must therefore intend wickednessto the Olive Branch , what can I do , eh ? You know who I am in Morlaix ? I am the brave Lucien Argandeau ! Can I say to them Pooi for your Englishman ! I stay here and do nothing about him ! ' Can I say that ? Not if I wish to remain the celebrated Lucien ! No , I must say , Hah ! The perfidious English ! Lucien Argandeau will show them somethingthat will make them laugh out of the wrong mouth ! He will go out alone and dispose of them ! Thank you very well ! ' Another thing , dear Marvin : There was a chance , eh ?  --  a chance that if we were quick and fortunate , we could have got her ashore , so that this Griffon could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had money , and we could have shown the British some cutting out of our own ! " He was silent , and Marvin as well , so that they heard nothing in the darkness of their lurching , coffin-like inclosuresave the smashing and rattling of the seas against the bows . " To show the British something ! " Argandeau whispered yearningly . " There is nothing else I want any more ! Women and wine are pleasant , but I have had a large share  --  so large a share that to count the favors ladies have shown me  --  Eh ! Can a man count the glasses of wine he has had ? Only the English are a flame in my head . Nowhere can I get money for a privateer except through you or your rabbit , dear Marvin ! " His voice was as soft as the murmur of a gentle wind among small leaves . " It was apparent to me that if your rabbit was deprived of the Olive Branch , she also lost the power of purchasing a privateer for me or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my efforts to saving the Olive Branch . Observe the clarity of my thoughts , dear Dan ! We French are logical above all other people ; and when you say I should have stayed ashore to look after your rabbit , you are not logical ! By the stomach of the Supreme Being , I did not even wait to go into the next building and tell her what was happening in the harbor . While there arep143Englishmen alive , I could not stay my feet ! No , no ! Argandeauto the fray ! Well , it was done , and now I grieve about your rabbit . I am sorry we have not tossed a knife into Slade before he made this trouble , but I am sorrier that we have lost our chance to privateer . These English , dear Marvin , there is nothing in the world like them ; and now I wish nothing in this life except to be in a fast vessel again , so that I can rip their seacoast from end to end ! " " Slade must have gone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seeming to have heard none of Argandeau 's words . " If I 'd got sail on her two minutes earlier  --  if those damned Frenchmen had let us haul in to the dock --  " If ! " Argandeau protested . " You are stuck full of ifs ! ' You will if ' yourself into a sickness ! You did everything very quick and with no slip . No man could do more . Duguay-Trouin , he could not have done more . Tom Souvillecould not have done more . My soul ! Argandeau himself could not have done more ! You dwell too much on this ! You must sleep , eh ? Sleep will wipe out the regrets that are false . You listen to me ! In Spain , when I am younger , I learn Spanish from a Spanish lady , very beautiful . She teach me a proverb for everything in the world . An " if " in the mind is as bad as a banderillo in the hide of a bull , ' she say . Also , she tell me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of tears . ' Whatever she wish to prove , she can prove with a proverb . " There was an end , at last , to the dizzy gyrations of the hole into which they were packed , and the prisoners , foul with the slime of the cable tier and sore from head to foot because of the bed of wet and stinking rope on which they had lain interminably , clambered weakly up the companionladdersto find the barque hove-to under heavy skies in the lee of the crowded dockyard of Sheerness , at the mouths of the Thames and the Medway , and under the guns of two lowering forts . The gray-faced officer watched them brought on deck ; then , with a faintly sour smile , he warned them against shouting or the making of unnecessary noises if they wished to enjoy the benefits of the open air . Doubtful concerning the quality of the smile , Marvin pressed forward . " With your permission , " hr said , " we 'd like to take our private belongings with us  --  our clothes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " the aged lieutenant asked . " There 's the picture of a lady in the small cabin " Marvin said . " No such thing ! " the lieutenant snapped . " There 's no picture of any kind on this vessel ! If there was , it would do you no good to take it ; there 's no room for such trumpery on the hulks . " " Our clothes " Marvin again ventured . " Clothes ! " the lieutenant exclaimed in disgust . " There 's nothing I 'd call clothes aboard this craft ! Nothing but dirty Yankee rags ! I suppose you 'll be trying to say you had something wearable , and that these men of mine stole them ! You 'll be provided with clothes aboard the hulks , so let me hear no more drivel about your filthy duds ! " Marvin shivered . His muscles tightened until his back and his neck ached from the strain of them . Argandeau tapped him on the shoulder and sighed gently . " I tell you they are a flame in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by the ironic cheers of thep145English seamen who had cut them out from Morlaix , they were packed into the waist of a government tender , with bearding nettings at both bulwarks and a squad of marines before and behind them ; and thus guarded , they bore off to the westward , into the curving channel of the River Medway  --  ariver with flat low shores and a wealth of mud banks from which there rose wisps of mist , smelling of decay . It was near dusk of that gray October afternoon when the tender , rounding a wide bend in the river , came into an expanse of water so broad that it had the appearance of a lake . Ranged along the center of this lake , and bulking mountain-like above the flat expanse of water and the low fields beyond , floated fifteen structures that seemed to Marvin to have the look of giant coffins , but coffins sadly misshapen by pipes and platforms and warts and knobs that protruded from them in a thousand places and at a thousand angles . " So there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hulks , that have been more terrible to France than any hell . " lie drew a deep breath , and then another . " Breathe deep , dear Marvin , while you can . There are Frenchmen in those coffins who have not breathed pure air for six long years . " The tender drew abreast of the rearmost hulk . She was , Marvin saw , the defaced and dirty remnant of what once had been a ship-of-the-line -- of what once had been more beautiful , with her tiers of gun ports , her symmetrical sweep of hull , her glistening paint , her towering masts , her web of rigging and her cloud-like spread of canvas , than any other structure fashioned by the hand of man . Argandeau growled faintly in his throat . " Look ! " he said . " Look how she is old and sick , I think with leprosy , and so squats there in anger , wishing never to move again ! It is a sight to make a seaman weep ! They are cruel to everything , even to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the countless pipes that were thrust from the sides of the soiled and dreary hulks , vapors that coiled and drifted downward like a mournful fog , so that the tender moved along the melancholy fleet through an acrid veil of smoke . She drew close to a hulk near the middle of the line ; and to the crew of the Olive Branch , silently staring from behind the boarding nettings that had been raised between them and any possibility of escape , came the shrill babble of unnumbered voices . A platform encircled the hulk three feet above the water ; and on the platform two sentries rattled their muskets and challenged sharply . " Tender Primrose , of Sheerness , " bawled a hoarse voice from the tender 's stern , " wiv twenty-four Amairikins , cut out of Morlaix by schooner Sparrow ! Consigned to Crown Prince hulk by orders of the Transport Office ! " High up in the lofty stern of this miserable vessel a window swung open , and from it peered a face with a babyishlook to it  --  a look as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never grown up . The features seemed pinched together , as though the eyes and nose and mouth , in infancy , had been seized in a ruthless hand and compressed until they had become fixed . " Are they washed ? " this face called down angrily . " Have they had a bath ? " " Yes , sir ! " shouted the hoarse voice from the Primrose . " Send them up ! " called the angry voice . " But if they had n't been , back they 'd have gone to Sheerness ! See youp147remember it , my man ! You bring any more dirty Yankees to this hulk , and either you 'll take ' em back to be washed , or wash ' em on your own deck ! " The Primrose swung against the landing stage , whence a long , canvas-sided companionway ran up to the high bulwarks of the Crown Prince . The boarding nettings were lowered , and the captain of the tender motioned the prisonerstoward the hulk . " You heard what he said ! " he growled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medway with a rope round your middle , stick to it you been washed ! " They mounted the companionway , and the tall Marvin , coming over the top of the bulwarks at the head of the line of seamen , found himself looking down into an oblong space that seemed to him the size of the floor of a fair-sized barn . Beyond a loop-holed wall at one end rose a drab and dreary forecastle , from which smokepipes protruded like pins from a pincushion . Armed sentries stood behind the Kull , and marines moved about on the forecastle itself , so that Marvin knew the forecastle belonged to those who guarded the prisoners . Beyond a similar wall at the other cud rose the structure that had been the quarter-deck ; and in his quick glance at it , Marvin saw it was still sacred to the ship 's officers ; for the pinch-faced man , dressed in a uniform too tight for him , stood silently at the break in the deck to watch the prisoners come aboard . The space between the quarter-deck and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever before seen packed into such a space  --  and from these men there ruse an odor so strong and penetrating that it caught at Marvin 's nostrils and his throat and sickened him . The garments of these men were shredded and tattered.  |p148Through  wisps of cloth showed skinny ribs : pipestem arms : bony shins and thighs . Such was the emaciation and pallor of this sorry crew that they had the look of skeletons who , by some devil 's dispensation , had risen from the dead in rotted grave clothes for a reunion in this purgatory of the sea . Yet there was nothing skeleton-like about their actions ; for they posed and pirouetted when Marvin came down among them . They capered insanely before him , flinging their arms about , moving their shoulders , screaming unceasinglyin shrill and womanish French . A thousand hands , it seemed to Marvin , were stretched forward to pat his back ; to touch his arms : his shoulders . " Les Americains ! " he heard them cry . " Les braves Arnericains ! General Madison brave homme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head the thought that war made strange bedfellows , and that a common cause could unite men of widely different races . In that moment he felt a movement against his thigh , and as his glance dropped toward it , he thought he saw the flicker of fingers drawn back with the speed of light . He clapped his hand to his pocket ; then turned quickly to the men from the Olive Branch . " Keep tight hold of your money ! " he told them . " They got mine ! " Argandeau came close up beside him and spoke in French to the jostling throng around them . What he said was said softly , and took not long in the saying , but the words had the hiss of a whiplash . The ragged Frenchmen fell away before Marvin , so that a lane was opened through them . Suddenly silent , they stared at one another and at the Americans with eyebrows raised , and with hands and shoulders that protested their innocence more clearly thanp149any words . Yet in their eyes Marvin seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He scanned their faces sharply . Rage filled him at his loss , hut in addition to the rage there was almost a sickness at the knowledge of his pennilessness ; for without money , he knew , a corpse would have less trouble in rising from its coffin than he would have in escaping from this hulk to go in search of Corunna and of Slade . An irate voice put an end to his attempt to find , among those pallid countenances , the face of the man who might have robbed him . " Here ! " the voice shouted . " Here ! Where do you think you are ? Get back here where you belong ! " It was the voice of the pinch-faced lieutenant ; and , Marvin , recognizing a dangerous childish fury in the sound of the words , hastened through the jostling Frenchmen to stand close under the high poop on which the angry lieutenant stood . He was , Marvin saw , a man approaching fifty , a plump man whose arms and legs were oversnug in an ornate uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . His hands , resting on the carved rail before him , were smooth and white , and heavy with rings . " Good God ! " he shouted , stamping his foot angrily . " Twenty-four more ! Over three hundred of you damned contrary Yankees aboard this ship already , and now twentyfourmore of you wretched contentious creatures ! You there  --  you tall man ! What was it you stopped for ? You spoke to someone ! You 've brought a letter to one of these prisoners ! I wo n't have it ! I 'll put you in the black hole 1 I 'll cut off your rations ! I 'll " " I 've done nothing ! " Marvin interrupted . " Nothing , but try to find the man that picked my pocket . "  |p150The  lieutenant , slack of lip , stared dully at him ; then burst abruptly into laughter . " Listen to that , Sugden ! " lie cried , turning to a small man who stood humbly beside him , his eyes downcast and a long book beneath his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world that was n't always talking about money or claiming he was badly treated ! Pocket picked ! ' Pon my word , Sugden , that 's positively convulsing ! Tomorrow he 'll have something to say about the food . Tough pleat , or weevily bread , most likely ! " Sugden laughed , a raven 's croak , and looked , grinning , at Marvin . " Most likely , " he agreed . " I warn you now , " the lieutenant told Marvin disdainfully . " There 's no sympathy on this ship for whiners ! Whine and escape ! Whine and escape ! You ought to have that motto on your flag along with the bars you 've already put on it . One of you 's worse than a thousand Frenchmen ! I 'll remind you now that those who try escaping from this hulk get the black hole ! Do n't forget it ! Give your names to Sugden ; then get over with the rest of your brave Amairikinsand let them find room for you on the lower deck , if they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault ! " He turned and minced away . Sugden set down Marvin 's name , vessel and other mattersin his long book . Another clerk tossed down to him a limp hammock , a bag of chopped rags and a blanket that had the feel of being woven from string . Behind him the Frenchmenwere dragging hammocks from an airing-stage and disappearingbeneath the hatches . He heard Argandeau supplyingSugden with astounding information  --  name , Lucien Argandeau ; nationality , American ; residence , Boston ; wife , one wife ; children , no children . Before he could protest , he felt a touch on his arm andp151whirled to see a man no taller than a cabin boy  --  a spare young man with a face of extreme gravity and crinkly side whiskers the color of corn-silk after a frost . He wore an overcoat so long that it was near to dragging on the deck . " Newton , " he said , holding out his hand to Marvin . " Matthew Newton of Salem . Matt to some and Newt to others , but answer to both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here for not fighting . Enemy , I am . Dangerous enemy ! Bad and dangerous ! Now I 'm President of the Lower Deck for a month . Come on forward . " He nodded his head toward the bow . " We got a law  --  no Americans allowed aft of the main hatch when there 's other Americans coming aboard . " " So you wo n't be robbed ? " Marvin asked doubtfully . " Oh dear , no ! " Newton exclaimed . " We have n't anything to steal ! It 's so none of us 'll lose his head and tell that fat snake Osmore what we think of him . If that should ever happen , he 'd starve us to death , innocent and guilty alike . " He turned briskly and led them forward to the Americans.  |p152THREE  hundred and twenty-seven Americans , Newton told them , were already quartered in the lower battery of the Crown Prince , and now there would be three hundred and fifty-one to pack in with their hammocks , like herring into a barrel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there were three hundred and nine Frenchmen , privateer officers for the most part ; while below them , on the orlop deck , slept another two hundred and sixteen of the Frenchmen , known as Raffales and Manteaux Imperiaux  --  men wholly lost and abandoned , who sold their very food and rags for money with which to gamble , and so went naked , except for single cloths which swarmed with insects , even as the imperial mantle of Napoleon swarmed with bees . " So here we are ! " Newton said . " We ca n't spread down onto the orlop deck , because no decent men could live withinsight or sound or smell of the Raff ales ; and we ca n't spread up with the officers and the bourgeois , because no American can get along with ' em . " He eyed Argandeau and grinned . " No offense , " he said . " Maybe somewhere there are better Frenchmen than those we 've got aboard this hulk , but here there is n't one we can trust : not even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in small ways . " " No offense , to me , " Argandeau said quietly . " I am a little tired of the French equality that is no equality at all , and the French liberty that gives Frenchmen no liberty except that of remaining in English prisons all their lives . For a time I shall try being an American  --  Lucien Argan/deau , of Boston . These French , they are what you say because they believe that all is fair in love and war , and they can prove to you that life is nothing else  --  war and love . It is of course true that the French are , as they say , the most logical of all people on earth ; but recently I have come to think that the simple truth is preferable to French logic . " Newton stared at him doubtfully , shrugged his shoulders and led them to the main hatchway . They descended its single ladder to the upper battery deck , where dim distances were filled with the upflung arms of Frenchmen , hanging their hammocks ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the Americans , crouching beneath the massive planking of the deck above , crawled about with upturned faces , seeking the numbers chalked beside their hammock-hooks . " It 's too late for shifting hooks , " Newton told them . " You 'll have to sleep on the deck , between two lines of hammocks . You get a powerful lot of fleas down there , and it might be you 'll be stepped on a few times , but you 'll have better air . Tomorrow we 'll squeeze these folks together , and you can sling your hammock amidships . " Marvin , close on Newton 's heels , dragged his hammock as best he could through the shifting , jostling , noisy mass of men . Newton 's hooks , he saw , were in a corner , near a barred porthole and a latrine ; and even as Newton made ' fast his hammock-rope of spun yarn to the ceiling , a chain rattled loudly beside him . The port fell shut with an echoing thud . An angry roar of protest rose from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Newton cried . " You 'd think they were afraid we 'd chop ourselves in pieces and squeeze through the bars of the ports if they were left open after dusk ! "  | One by one the other ports along the lower battery slammed shut with a rattle of chains , and on that crowded mass of prisoners there descended a blackness that seemed to Marvin to thrust itself into his ears and press against his eyelids . " Bring a light here ! " Newton shouted . " There 's twentyfourmen got to sleep on the deck between No. i and No. 2 rows in the northwest quarter . " A sulphur spunk flickered into blue flame near Marvin , then yellowed as a candlewick took fire . " Get your hammocks in place , " Newton urged the men from the Olive Branch . " Anybody caught with a light gets three days black hole on half rations , so all candles are doused if we have word from above that anybody 's com-ing . " The hammocks , Marvin saw , formed a continuous layer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hammocktouching those on either side . Here and there , in this gigantic slit of a room , the dim light of a candle glowed palely . Stowed in their hammocks or squatting beneath them , the prisoners gabbled and shouted , the chorus of their voices striking on Marvin 's ear like the muffled outcry of innumerable sea gulls . " ' Tis n't anything you ca n't stand , " Newton told him , thrusting his head over the end of his hammock to look down at him . " When I was pressed onto the Poictiers , me being supercargo of one of my father 's brigs and fresh out of Harvard College , I thought I 'd die in a week , what with the terrible food , and the slave drivers they called officers , and the workhouse mongrels in the crew . But my goodness alive ! I got fat on it ! I 'd have got fat on it even if the captainhad n't made me his secretary . Give a man fresh air and ,  |p155a  little work and enough food to fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 'll get along . " To Marvin it seemed as though the air had suddenly been heated by a giant stove . It had the feel , he thought , of an animal 's breath  --  the breath of an enormous beast that had preyed on carrion  --  and with the thought , a black depression tilled his brain , so that the realization of his lamentable state came fully to him . In his mind 's eye he saw Morlaix once more , cold and drab at the end of the narrow estuary , and as distant as those far-off Chinese cities that seemed less real than dreams . It was , indeed , like a figure in a dream that Corunna trembled in a sad perspective before him ; a figure remote and small , and surely beyond the reach of one who lay , like these unfortunates , half clothed , half fed , and only half alive . " I suppose he will , " Marvin responded at length , becomingaware that Newton was contemplating him curiously . " Yes , he 'll get along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these men here on this deck ; they 're in prison for nothing , all of ' em . Every last one of ' em , nearly , is in the same box I am . They were hauled out of American ships by British press gangs before the war broke out , and made to serve aboard British cruisers  --  hell-ships , they 're called by some , and hell-ship ' is the proper word for ' em . When the war came on , they said they would n't fight against America . That 's all  --  just would n't lay a gun against a Yankee craft . For that they catted us , the bloody lobsters ; whipped us like balky horses ; chopped our backs to hash , and threw us into these hulks , so that we came into ' em feeling pretty bad  --  pretty bad ! " Newton laughed mildly . " If we were felons , we 'd have better treatment . If we 'd murdered our mothers , we 'd be putp156in a prison ship , same as this ; but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never put more than four hundred criminals in a prison ship ; but we 're more than criminals . We 're prisoners of war . We wo n't fight for ' em ; so they jam as many as nine hundred of us into each hulk  --  us who never did anything to ' em . " He laughed a laugh so mirthless that it ended in a cough . " Not yet we have n't done anything to ' em , but some day we will ! " He stared down at Marvin unwinkingly . " I give ' ern credit ! " he said . " They did what they could to keep us just barely breathing . They underfed us , so they could make money out of our food ; and they gave us no clothes to wear if so be our clothes wore out ; and worst of all , they took our air from us at night ; but it has n't killed us  --  not any of us ! We 're alive , all of us ! " He studied Marvin 's face intently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body with his eyes . " It 's easy to see you 've had enough air and plenty of victuals . You look as if you could stand some punishment  --  swim ashore , even ! " " Swim ashore ! " Marvin exclaimed thickly . So heavy had the air become that Newton 's hammock , dimly seen above him , seemed to have descended on his chest . The mere act of breathing had grown to be a labor , and there was a ringingin his ears  --  a ringing broken by short silences that must , he told himself , be sleep , but that seemed more like lapses into a poisoned stupor . He shook his head to free it of the rank fog that enveloped him , and into his mind came the sallow face of Slade , its drooping eyelid giving it an expression of malicious triumph . " Swim ashore ! " he repeated . " I 'd swim a hundred miles to get to shore and to France ! '  |p157He  moved to rise to his feet , but his head struck the bottomof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared , and his hammock sagged as if he had lost interest in the subject . " Well , " he said , " sweet , reams ! I 'll see you in the morning . " It seemed to Marvin , staring up with hot eyes into the ( lark , that he was caught in a tomb . Through the web of noises that surrounded him he could hear Argandeau close beside him , squirming and scratching . " In some circumstances it is a terrible thing to be too alluring , " Argandeau sighed . " I think all the fleas upon this Crown Prince hulk must be females , because I do not believe that anybody else but me is receiving attention from any of them . " At seven in the morning , the ports were raised and the gratings removed from the hatches ; and Marvin , shoulderinghis hammock and bedding , followed his fellow prisoners up the ladders to be counted . In the dusk of the day before , the French prisoners had seemed miserable , but the naked creatures who came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrible . To Marvin , waiting his turn , after the counting , to stack his hammock on the coveredplatform over the main hatch , they had the look of vicious and repulsive animals as they scuttled down the laddersagain to their den on the orlop deck . Newton came to him through the press of prisoners . " Here , " he told Marvin , " come up on the forecastle . I want to show you something . " Marvin , drawing Argandeau with him , followed the small swaggering figure in the overlong greatcoat as it bustled forward and mounted nimbly to the high forecastle ,  | from which a reek of smoke rose through a score of pipes . Four marines in threadbare scarecrow uniforms growled glumly at Newton as he stopped before them to strike an attitude that had something of the heroic about it . " Ho ! " one of the marines exclaimed . " ' Ere 's the bloomin ' hactor ! Well , we ai n't got nuffin ' for yer ! No tobaccer ; no ole clo'es ; no needles ner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands before him , Newton raised sad eyes to the speaker 's face . " Pity ! " he whispered . " Have pity on a pore unfortunate woman turned into the snow with her two tender children "  --  he gestured dramatically toward Marvin and Argandeau  --  " by an unnatural and inhuman father , with never so much as a sup of rum or a measly piece of twist to hearten them against the bitter winter winds ! Ah , my children ! My pore , pore children ! Ah , the pity of it , to see them waste before my very eyes for lack of the barest necessities of life ! " He seemed to sob and droop . One of the marines snorted . Another said angrily , " We ai n't got none , I tell yer ! " " Ah , say not so ! " Newton cried . He drew himself erect and thrust a hand into the bosom of his greatcoat . " None ! None ! In all this broad demesne , no single piece of twist ! No twist in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this earth of majesty , this seat of Mars , this other Eden , demi-paradise , this fortress built by Nature for herself against infection and the hand of war , this happy breed of men , this little world , this precious stone set in the silver sea , which serves it in the office of a wall or as a moat defensiveto a house , against the envy of less happier lands ,  --  this blessed plot , this earth , this realm , this England ! No , twist ! Good God , no twist in England ! " Passionately he struck his brow with his clenched fist , and staggered.  | " Oh , ' Ell ! " one of the marines growled . He drew a fragment of rope tobacco from his pocket and reluctantly handed it to Newton , who examined it suspiciously , dusted it against the front of his coat , and suddenly bit off the larger part of it . He returned the remainder to the marine and , deaf to his hoarse outcries , herded Marvin and Argandeau to the starboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newton said . " Those lobsters wo n't bother us , for fear of losing the rest of their tobacco . Still , it 's best to talk low and keep your eyes open . " The three of them stared out over the wind-swept waters of the Medway . Ahead and astern extended the long line of soiled and misshapen hulks , each one attended , as though it had spawned during the night , by a small fleet of vegetable and supply boats . Along the main channel of the river , between the hulks and the windmills and neatly hedged fields , moved brigs and ships and sloops , bound to or from the docks of Chatham . Newton turned an uncertain eye on Argandeau . " There 's Some situations that require frank speaking , " he said to Marvin . " Now I 've got nothing against this French friend of yours ; but what I 've got to say is important ; and if anyoneshould be careless enough to blab , it might be the death of us . " Marvin nodded . " What you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . He 's here himself because of helping me try to stay away . If I get out , he gets out too . " " All right , " Newton said hastily . " All right ! That 's understood . Now look here . " He spat negligently at a passing supply-boat . " Opposite this hulk , on shore , is a village . See ' t ? " " We see it , " Marvin said.  |p16o  " All right , " Newton whispered . " That 's Jillingum , tha . village is . Spelled Gillingham , ' but pronounced ' Jillingum , ' the way they do here . To the right of the village there 's two windmills . In line with ' em , and fifty yards off shore , there 's a mud bank . See it ? " Marvin nodded . " That bank runs all the way along this reach , out of water most of the time . Sometimes only a little out . Could you swim that far at night in cold water  --  real cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The mud in those banks is like glue , " Newton remarked . " You go into it pretty near up to your middle . That 's the trouble with getting to shore  --  if you swim as far as the banks , you 're pretty tired , on account of having to carry things with you ; so when you strike the mud , you ca n't get through it , sometimes . Sometimes , when the ports are opened in the morning , we see men in the mud , dead . The British leave ' em there all day  --  two days , sometimes  --  so they 'll be a lesson to the rest of us . " In a thoughtful voice , he added : " The crows eat ' em . " The three men stared silently at the square green fields and the slowly turning windmills , toy-like against the clear sky . " Well ? " Newton asked . " Well what ? " Marvin demanded . " Do you think you could get through the mud ? " " Why , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have got through it , no ? " Argandeau asked . Newton nodded . " Three out of five got through it a month ago  --  Americans . Frenchmen have got through it , but mostly they were new men  --  privateer captains . Tom Souville got through it four times , and reached Francep161twice , but he was captured three times and brought back . " Argandeau laughed silently . His close-cropped black head wagged gently from side to side . " Tom Souville ! " he exclaimed . " When I am a young man in Calais , I have taught Tom Souville tricks in swimming . There is nothing Tom Souville can do that I can not do . " They were silent again , staring at the distant and harmless-seeming gray thread of the mud bank . " There 's one more thing , " Newton said at length . " How much can you fight ? " Marvin looked thoughtfully at his knuckles . " I do n't rightly know . I never had to fight very hard . What I 've had to do has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and appraised him carefully . " Well , " he said slowly , " well , I 'll tell you . I 'll tell you just how it is . It 's a hard job to escape from these hulks  --  a dreadful chore ! ' Tis n't as if you just escaped whenever you felt like it ; you 've got to have money , and you 've got to protect yourself from informers , and you 've got to be prepared , and you 've got to have the good will of the rest of the prisoners , and you 've got to have the permission of the governingcommittee , and you 've got to be relieved of your prisoner duties . Then , when all those things have been arranged , you 're obliged to go to work and cut your way out . It 's the hardest work in the world ! If you laid out on a topgallant yard night and day for a month , trying to hand a sail that 's stiff with ice , and never got it handed , it would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even after you 've got the permission and the money . " " My money was stolen when I came aboard last night , " Marvin said . " How much money does it take ? "  | " Wait , " Newton said . " I 'm coming to that . Now I 'll tell you how it is : I want to get out of this place ! ' Tis n't that I ca n't stand the bad food and the bad air and the bad clothes or the bad Frenchmen . These bad Frenchmen , they 're a joke ! They 're so eager to take advantage of us Americans that all you got to do is to give ' em an inch of rope and they 'll hang themselves . See this overcoat ? " Marvin nodded . " That 's a French coat , " Newton said . " They think I 'm easy because I 'm little and look worried when I gamble with ' em . The Frenchmen are n't anything as long as you watch ' em  --  not anything ! What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English and not being able to ! Listen ! " He took Marvin by the upper arms and seemed to shiver in the grip of a violent emotion . " Do you know why they take so many prisoners and starve us the way they do ? It 's because half of England 's fattening on our hunger and nakedness and cold . The more of us they capture , the fatter England grows . Seventy-five thousand of us , French and Americans together , and the contractors take money for clothes we 're supposed to get , but never do , and for food that 's never fed to us ! The commander of this ship , the drunken hog , fought to get the job ! It pays him seven shillings a day , but he 'll be a rich man in three years , huntingfoxes in a red coat and talking about filthy Americans ! I was secretary to a captain , I tell you , and I know what I 'm talking about ! I 've got to get out of here ! I 'll blow up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't blame you , " Marvin said thoughtfully , " but if it 's as hard to escape as you say , you 'd be better off , would n't you , to stop talking about it ? " Newton gripped the high bulwarks of the prison ship andp163laughed exultantly . " Stop ? " he cried . " Stop ? Why , no ! I 've just started ! I 've been waiting for the right men ! For the right men ! It 's my turn to go and you 're the man I want to go with . You 're strong and you 're big . You 'll make it , and if I go with you , I 'll have no trouble . This man , too "  --  he whirled to poke Argandeau 's arched chest  --  " he 'd get through , and the Indian you brought aboard . There 's nobody else aboard this hulk I 'd risk it with . I do n't think the others could make it . They 're weak and hungry . Most of ' em are sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long . You 're different ! When I saw you come aboard , it seemed to me you must be the man I 've been waiting for ever since they threw me into this "  --  he laughed again  --  " this demi-paradise ; this precious stone set in the silver sea ; this England ! " Marvin looked quickly over his shoulder at the four marines , lounging at the forecastle rail ; then stared intently at Newton . The small man hitched up his long overcoat around him . " I 'll tell you how it is , " he said , and his crinkly yellow side whiskers seemed to quiver . " If you can lick a man as big as you are , and maybe a little bigger  --  if you 've got the heart to take a pounding and give back better than you get  --  I can contrive for the three of you to have a chance to go . I can do it ! There 's only one stipulation , and that is that you take me . " He shivered . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , you 'll make it ! " He hesitated , seeming to withdraw a little into his voluminousouter garment ; then added , " Or you 'll probably get killed trying . " Marvin drew a deep breath , but in spite of it , his voice trembled somewhat : " That 's reasonable enough . Just show me who I 've got to fight to get myself out of here . "  |p264Two  of the long wooden benches in the lower battery had been dragged into the corner where Newton 's hammock hung at night , and so arranged that they protruded from the corner in a narrow V.At the point of the V sat Newton , flanked on each side by five committeemen . Two other committeemen sat on the deck , ten feet in advance of the point of the V ; and to Marvin , who waited restlessly near them , they volunteered the information that they were thus stationed as pickets to warn away such prisoners as might be tempted to intrude on the committee 's deliberations . Nor was their office an idle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguing , yammering , whistling and singing ; some of them cutting soup bones into miniature planks for the making of ship models ; some weaving delicate boxes from fragments of straw , or carving dolls and chessmen from beef knuckles ; others patrolling the deck ceaselessly , offeringfor sale a desirable sleeping location , the butt of a candle or a thimbleful of grease for use in a lamp ; still others trying to sell their services for the repairing of shoes or the mending of clothes . Among them moved emaciated , half-naked Frenchmen , prowling restlessly in search of unknownmatters , or soliciting patronage for the gambling tables in the upper battery . " Sheer off ! " the pickets growled to all of them . " Sheerp165off ! Committee 's in session for the good of the deck ! Sheer off ! " Marvin , allowed inside the picket line by Newton 's orders , heard Newton address the ten committeemen . " There 's several things to come before this meeting , " he told them . " First is , what 's to be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent ? There 's fiftysevenAmericans next door to naked , and sixty-six without coats of any kind . By December there 'll be two hundred without any clothes except rags so rotten that thread wo n't hold ' em together . Twelve hundred new prisoner suits were supposed to be delivered last month , the French say , but they say we 'll never see ' em . Osmore and the contractors keep the money , and the clothes never even get made . If we ca n't get help from Beasley , we 'll freeze , all of us . " " How many times has he been written to ? " asked a sourvisagedman whose mouth was puckered as if from the eatingof persimmons . " The committees on this hulk have written him eighteen times since August fifteenth , Captain Taylor . " The committeemen moved restlessly on their benches , ano it was Captain Taylor who broke the silence again : " If the contractor would buy back our fish allowance next fish day , we might get enough to put an advertisement in Bell 's Weekly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow countrymen . " " That 's all right , " complained a man whose head and chest were enveloped in a hood of flour sacking , " only it appears to me this taxation business is getting kind of overdone . I do n't feel like these men ought to be asked to give up any more food , not even those smoked herrings . They 're about starved already ; so starved that if they got took sick ,  | with the doctor paying no attention to sick men , they 'd die in a minute ! " " There ai n't anybody can eat the fish , Henry ! " Taylor objected . " The French , they say they marked some of ' em , so they can be recognized , and they been in use for seven years  --  delivered at three pennies and bought back for a penny . " " Maybe so , " Henry admitted , and Marvin saw that his face had an unearthly whiteness to it  --  the whiteness , almost , of the belly of a flatfish . " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you watch me eat mine ! I 'm getting so I can eat anything  --  even a newspaper that 's been wrapped ' round a fish ! " " Yes , " Newton interrupted , " and there 's another thing . Our Statesman subscription runs out next week , and that means twenty-eight shillings a month for the paper and sixteen shillings a month delivery charges . " He laughed bitterly . " Twenty-eight shillings a month ! No wonder the English do n't know anything . Knowledge comes too high ! Anyway , we got to sell two days ' fish and one day 's bread to get that renewed , provided you want it renewed . " " Want it renewed ! " one of the committeemen exclaimed . " We got to have it renewed . If there ai n't any news nor anything to read , there wo n't be anything to talk about , and we might as well be dead . " " Newton , " said sour-mouthed Captain Taylor thoughtfully , " how much of that sixteen shillings goes to Osmore ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He might get fifteen . Even so , it 's no use trying to do anything about it , . because the one that tried to make trouble would get the black hole for two weeks . ' Tis n't worth it ! Gosh ! I'dp167rather give up all my fish forever than get two weeks black hole ! " " I move , " said Henry , from the folds of his flour sacking , " that this committee communicate with Beasley in writingfor the nineteenth time , and send a letter to the President of the United States saying that the American agent for prisoners of war in England does nothing to prevent said prisoners from being treated like some sort of weasels . I also move that enough of our fish be collected and sold by the president of this lower battery to obtain the Statesman for another month . " " You know there 's no use writing to the President of the United States , " Newton objected wearily . " There 's no way of getting it out except through an escaping prisoner ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the whole committee 'd get the black hole , and all the other prisoners would have their tools and trades seized and destroyed ! I 'd like to hear that motion restated . " Henry jumped to his feet , pulling at the flour sacking around his throat . " ' Tai n't right ! " he exclaimed , his voice shaking as if with cold . " My God , you ca n't starve men and trample on ' em and murder ' em like this , and keep ' ern gagged while you do it ! You ca n't , I tell you ! You " " Henry ! " Captain Taylor said sharply . Henry 's voice persisted , shrill and trembling , " They treat us worse than animals , the damned rotten skunks ! They ca n't keep me quiet ! There 's some way to get help  --  there 's got to be ! " " Henry ! " Captain Taylor shouted . He grasped Henry by the arm and pulled him down on the bench , shaking him roughly . " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these prisoners . See that you do it ! "  |p168Henry  drew a deep and quivering breath , and the committeemenstared at their travesties of shoes , a strange and silent gathering . " Well , " Newton said at length , " we do n't need it put in the form of a motion . I 'll get the Statesman and tend to writing to Beasley again . " He cleared his throat and rose to his feet , drawing his long , ragged overcoat tight around him . " There 's one more thing , and that 's the question of who goes next . " He eyed the committeemen significantly ; and they , coming suddenly to life , fixed their eyes eagerly on him . " We 're wasting time , " he went on . " Everybody wants to be next and nobody 's willing to recognize the claims of anybody else . Meanwhile the food and the grease has accumulatedwithout any work being done  --  no work at all ! First thing you know , some of the Frenchmen , they 'll get through and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat patrol , and Osmore 'll have the planking sounded four times a day instead of once . This business ought to be settled , and settled now . Somebody 's got to get letters out of this place , so we can get some money , and I say we ought to agree on somebody that can do it . " " I was one of the first Americans aboard this hulk ! " Henry exclaimed . " You know it too ! I ought to have first chance ! " " Henry , " Captain Taylor said kindly , " you 're wrong about this ! Your spell in the black hole was pretty hard on you  --  harder'n you thought for , I guess . I notice you going up the ladder mornings , and you blow like a porpoise when you get on deck . You have n't been getting near enough , food , and you 'd never even reach the mud bank . "  | " I tell you I would ! " Henry said . " I 'd rather die trying , anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Newton said , " maybe you would , but we would n't rather have you ! Now you listen to me ! I say the thing to do is to turn this over to a new man , fresh aboard . " Captain Taylor shook his head , and from the look of his mouth he might have been eating chokecherries . " No , " he said , " you figure he 'd be successful because he 'd be strong and well fed ; but you do n't want to forget that these men here in this lower battery have got something almost as good as strength  --  they 're dreadful mad ! They hate the British worse than anything on earth ! " " That 's what I say ! " Henry exclaimed . " That 's what I been trying to tell you ! I 'm dreadful mad , and I 'd be as successfulas anyone ! " Newton stared thoughtfully from Henry to Captain Taylor , who quickly lowered his eyes . " No , " Newton said , " that is n't the way I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be easier for everyone to agree on a new man  --  a man they never saw before  --  and I figure he 'd be quicker doing the work  --  doing the cutting . ' Twould n't be so hard for him to drive himself as it is for us , who 've been breathing poison down here every night . " " They would n't agree , " Captain Taylor said . " I wo n't agree ! " Henry stubbornly insisted . Newton crouched down between the benches and looked up into the thin and sullen faces of the committeemen . " I had word from Osmore yesterday , " he whispered . " Captain Stannage and the rest of his friends are coming aboard Saturday afternoon to get drunk again , ladies and all , damn the blowsy sluts ! "  | " Osmore sent you word ? " Captain Taylor asked . " I supposethat means " Yes ! " Newton exclaimed . " It means he 'll bring Little White with him . It means he aims to have a couple more of us hammered to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Osmore told me to make the usual offer . " The committeemen growled angrily , and Captain Taylor shook his head . " I do n't like it ! " he said . " It 's a bad business , this Little White ! I would n't mind if it was Frenchmenhe jellied , but it goes against the grain to hear him howling his black laughter and see him smashing our people until they 're no more than raw meat , and they submitting to it for the sake of a twenty-shilling note ! " Newton laughed confidently , and his crinkly yellow side whiskers seemed to bristle , so that he had the eager look of a small dog on the trail of game . " All right ! But what if Little White got smashed himself when he set out to do the smashing ? What do you suppose Osmore 'd say , and Stannage , and those wenches of his that have been tittering at us and looking at us all summer as if we were foxes in a cage ? How 'd you like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own medicine ? " The committeemen stared at him with eyes that suddenlyglittered . Captain Taylor looked over his shoulder at the tall figure of Marvin , standing behind the two lookouts ; then turned back to Newton with a sour smile . " So that 's it ! " he said . " Well , it 's a thing we 'd be powerful glad to see , all of us , and it might put heart into us , what 's more ; but it appears to me you 're expecting too much . " " What if I 'm not ? " Newton demanded . " What if he can do it ? Would you be willing he should be the next in line ? Would you agree on him ? "  | " What you so anxious about him for ? " Henry demanded . Newton turned on him . " My land ! Ca n't you see ? He 'd be fighting for the chance to get out , and for the money to take advantage of the chance ! " " Bring him over here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's call , Marvin stepped over one of the benches and stood between the two rows of committeemen . " Daniel Marvin , of Arundel , " Newton said . " His barque was cut out of Morlaix by the Sparrow schooner . " The committeemen eyed him almost carelessly , as though their interest in him was slight . " Marvin ? " Captain Taylor asked at length . " Marvin ? Seems to me there used to be a Marvin out of Arundel in the Talleyrand brig , trading in Havana . " " The Talleyrand brig was my father 's . " " H 'm ! " Captain Taylor said noncommittally . " Was your father cut out of Morlaix ? " " No , sir . I was aboard the Olive Branch barque . Captain Dorman was master  --  Captain Dorman , of Arundel . He was killed in the doldrums , trying to fight off a British gun-brig. l lis daughter took command of the barque and brought her into Morlaix . She 's alone there now . " The committeemen , Marvin felt , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him were few and furtive . " Seems to me I heard tell , " Captain Taylor continued finally , " that the Talleyrand brig was so named because your father helped Talleyrand to buy land from General Knox . " " Yes , sir . " " What reason you got for thinking you could beat this Little White if you ai n't ever seen him ? " Henry demanded suddenly  |p172Marvin  stared down at his knuckles and worked his left shoulder under his jacket . " I do n't know that I could . They say he 's a good fighter , and heavier than I am . Well , I 've thought about him , and I believe I 've figured out a way to offset his extra weight . I 've figured out a new way to fight . Still , I would n't be interested in trying unless I knew I was n't wasting my time . " " Wasting your time ! " exclaimed another committeeman harshly . " Why , there 's a standing offer of twenty pounds to the man that beats Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a friend of Osmore , made that offer . Twenty pounds to any prisoner that does it  --  twenty shillings to him if he tries and does n't . " Marvin nodded . " I do n't take much pleasure in fighting , " he said . " I would n't risk it if there was nothing in it but the twenty pounds . " Newton seized Marvin 's wrist and raised his arm . " Look at his reach ! " he told them softly . " It 's the first time we 've had a man aboard with a reach like that ! It 's nearly as good as Little White 's ! " " If you knew you were n't wasting your time , " Captain Taylor reminded him , " you say you 'd be interested in fightingthis Little White ? " " Yes , " Marvin said . " Whether you could beat him or not ? " Henry asked . Marvin nodded . " I want to escape from this hulk , " he said . " I want to get back to Morlaix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Little White , he 'll have to kill me to beat me . " Newton laughed , a laugh so nervous that it was almost a titter . " There it is ! " he exclaimed to the committeemen . " What more do you want than that ? " pI73 " What is it you figure we ought to agree to ? " Captain Taylor asked ; then puckered his mouth sourly . " Nothing unreasonable , " Marvin said . " I want to be allowed to escape , and I want the right to pick the men that work with me and go out with me  --  if it ever comes to that . 7'Iiree others I 'd want to take , no more ; and all for good and sufficient reasons . I 'd expect all four of us to receive the usual supplies and protection while working . " " You mean nobody else would be allowed to use your cutting , provided you 're successful ? " Henry demanded . " Not for three nights  --  not until we 've had time to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry declared angrily . " Oh , here , here ! " Captain Taylor said . " That 's fair ! If they get away , we can pass men through the bulkhead to answer to roll call , so the four wo n't be missed ; and when the three days are up , everyone can go that has enough money and food . If one of the four should be caught , nobodyelse would have a chance anyway . " " Well --  " said Henry weakly . He looked helplesslyfrom one committeeman to another , his face chalk-white in the flickering light that danced across the ceiling from the reflection of the sun on the crinkled water of the Medway . " Gorry ! " exclaimed a committeeman in dogskin trousers , one of the legs being made of the skin of a red setter and the other of the skin of a coach dog . " Gorry ! I say yes  --  whether he beats him or not ! " " No ! " Captain Taylor protested sternly . " Not unless he beats him ! If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , and so does Henry . You do , do n't you , Henry ? " " Yes , " Henry said reluctantly , " I guess I do . " A glance at the other committeemen seemed to satisfy Captain Taylor , for he nodded soberly to Newton and then rose from his bench to prod inquiringly at Marvin 's biceps . " In that case , " Newton said briskly , " this meeting stands adjourned and I appoint the entire committee to demand a contribution of salt from each prisoner so we can get his hands in pickle with no loss of time . "  |p175THE  barge that drew up to the landing stage of the Crown Prince hulk at noon on Saturday seemed to blaze with color ; for the oarsmen wore uniforms of blue flannel with the arms of the Stannages on breast and back in silver , gold and red ; while in the cockpit sat Stannage himself , resplendent in a hussar 's uniform , all gold and scarlet . Around him clung a group of damsels in silks , furs and feathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the bulwarks at them , to consist largely of shrill laughter and shriller screams . Between Stannage 's knees crouched an enormous brown dog , thin and yellow-eyed , that panted constantly despite the chill wind that blew across the Medway , and cast longinglooks over one side of the barge and then over the other . Close behind him stood a towering , smiling negro , whose noisy laughter ran like an undercurrent beneath the high-pitched merriment of the captain 's gentle companions , and whose Eastern splendor dimmed the finery of the others . On his head was perched a vast turban of yellow satin , decorated with a tall plume held in place by a glittering bauble seemingly made of pearls and diamonds ; beneath his short jacket of crimson satin a broad sash of gold cloth shone dully against the velvety black of his skin ; and crimsonsatin trousers , voluminous enough , Marvin was sure , to make a dozen potato sacks , hung to his ankles , where they were fastened by tight gold bands.  | " There he is ! " Newton said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him , Dan ? " Marvin shook his head . " Why , " he said , " he looks like a handy man to have around a pivot gun or a galley stove , provided he got a rap from a belaying pin every few minutes to remind him where he belongs . " Newton nodded . " That 's something he has n't had in some little time . These people over here , they 're all excited over Molineaux , the American negro who fought Tom Cribb . In consequence , they ca n't see a black man a little bigger than usual without thinking he 's a fighter , and making a pet of him . " Cackling hilariously , Little White , evidently at his master 's bidding , leaned over and took one of the damsels beneath the arms as though she had been a doll , held her for a moment over the side of the barge , so that she screamed and kicked like an excited child ; then deposited her on the landing stage and spanked her briskly to start her up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarlet , fur-trimmed hussar'sjacket , laughed as heartily at the playfulness of his dusky favorite as did any of the jeering prisoners that peered down at him from the bulwarks . Marvin moved uncomfortably . " Why , " he said suddenly , " this Stannage ought to have his face washed and be put to bed ! He 's only a child ! He 's never a captain  --  not at his age ! " " Oh , is n't he ? " Newton exclaimed . " Well , he is , and he 's more than a child ! He 's an idiot  --  the idiot son of rich idiots ; so his family bought him a captaincy to get him out of the way . It 's an old English custom ! There 's regiments over here officered entirely by idiots and children whosep177places have been bought for ' em . You can do anything with money in England ; there 's no place that 's not for sale  --  church , state , army or navy . " Marvin laughed . " I guess they 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you 're trying to make me madder at them than I am , you do n't need to  --  not by lying about ' em . " " Lying ? " Newton cried . " Lying ? Why  --  well , wait till you know ' ern ! Lying ! It was only a couple of years ago that the Duke of York was helping Mary Anne Clarke to sell any job in England to the highest bidder ! The King 's son and a bawd ! It 's no use having merit in England , not unless you have money along with it ; and if you have no money , you 're no better than a criminal ! They pressed me into their damned navy , and I know ' em , and I 'm glad I do , because it is n't Nature for people like that to *in wars from people like us . That 's mighty small consolation to a man who 's buried in the hulks ! Mighty small , but better than nothing ! " The boyish Stannage , looking petulant , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reluctant brown dog ; while Little White , crowding close behind with baskets , boxes and cloaks , rolled his eyes defiantlyat the prisoners who watched him . Argandeau , beside Marvin , sighed heavily . " It is well that I understand which is the master and which is the man , " he said , " because if I did not , I might think that the smaller one was brought here by the black one for our amusement . " He watched the two gayly caparisoned figures mounting to the quarter-deck from the throng of emaciated , tattered scarecrows that packed the waist ; then tapped Marvin on the arm . " In those baskets , " he reminded him , " there is wine and fine food and yet more wine that they will be two hours in consuming . Two hours is no great time , so you must come now and have your dinner  --  two rotten carrots and a biscuit palpitating with weevils . " Marvin , climbing the ladders from the lower battery to the upper deck , mounted two hours later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shudder , as at the roaring of a storm  --  seemed almost to be sinking in a sea of sound . The deck itself had become an amphitheater , and every exposed part of it , save for the quarter-deck and a square inclosure in front of the break in the poop , was massed with ragged , excited prisoners . There were prisoners clinging like ants to the two stubby signal masts ; prisoners ranged in a triple tier along the high bulwarks ; prisoners hanging like swarming bees against the face of the forecastle . All of them , wedged immovably in their places though they seemed to be , had freed their arms to shake a fist at the inclosurebeneath the poop , so that the whole dreary hulk had the appearance of fluttering and vibrating , while from nine hundred throats there came an angry and derisive screaming . In the center of the inclosure , set off by ropes from the close-packed prisoners who crouched around it , strutted the towering crimson form of Little White ; and from the continuousrapid movement of his grinning lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces of the prisoners closest to him , Marvin knew he was making game of them . From time to time he turned and looked up to the babyfacedhussar captain , standing at the rail of the quarterdeckwith Lieutenant Osmore , and thence to the chattering women , who now sat comfortably , wineglasses it theirp179hands , on either side of the hulk commander and their host . There was pride and almost admiration in the smiles they gave him ; and even as Marvin , preceded by Newton and followed closely by Argandeau , forced his way from the main hatch toward the ring , a woman 's gayly colored silk scarf floated downward from the quarter-deck and was deftly caught by Little White  --  caught and flaunted proudly in the faces of the howling prisoners . At the sight of Marvin , crawling under the ropes of the ring with the small and heavily overcoated Newton , Little White ceased his posturing and stared intently at the tall American ; then , catching his eye , he thrust out his lower jaw and grimaced horribly , his mouth spreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ape . Marvin stared hard at him with a horrid fascination and shivered perceptibly , whereupon the roar with which the prisoners were greeting their champion 's appearance becameenfeebled with misgiving and died pathetically away . On the quarter-deck two marines thumped on the drums slung at their sides . Lieutenant Osmore placed his right hand between the first and second buttons of his coat , frowned portentously and raised his left hand in a gesture of command . Over the hulk there fell an uneasy silence . " You know the terms of this exhibition ! " Osmore said in his shrill , domineering voice . " Captain Sir Rafe Stannagehas kindly consented to permit his attendant  --  ah  --  White  --  ah  --  Little White  --  to display once more that art unknown to more  --  ah  --  effeminate , more cruel and more cowardly peoples  --  ah  --  the art sprung from British hardihoodand love of fair play  --  ah  --  the art of pugilism ! " He inclined his head to Stannage , who was staring as though baffled at a leather strap in his left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a roar  --  short , sharp and profoundly ironical . " You know the terms ! " Osmore repeated . " Any fighting or opprobrious remarks among the prisoners will result in two days black hole for the offenders . The rules of the exhibitionwill be Broughton 's rules . Each round to be consideredended on the fall of one or both contestants . After each fall , each man to be brought to scratch within thirty seconds or be deemed  --  ah  --  beaten . No falling without the striking of an honest blow . Challenger to receive one pound for his brave attempt , and if successful  --  ah , ha-ha !  --  if successful , twenty guineas ! " Osmore chuckled and cleared his throat importantly . " The challenger of  --  ah  --  White  --  of Little White  --  ah -- is "  --  he drew a small paper from his coat and peered at it  --  " is one Marvin , of Arun-del . " He scanned the paper again , frowning , and repeated the word " Arun-del . " Stannage stepped to his side and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englishman ? " Osmore frowned severely down at Marvin , who stood patiently at one side of the ring , his ear inclined to the prolongedwhisperings of Newton . " Arun-del ! " Osmore ex claimed , striking the paper with his hand . " This says Arun-del ! There 's no Arun-del in America ! " Marvin nodded . " A-rundle , it 's pronounced . " " Never heard of the place ! Where is it ? " Osmore asked . " Where ? " Marvin said , looking up at him thoughtfully . " It 's no great distance from Bunker Hill and Saratoga . " A whisper arose from the men crouched at the ringside , a small dry titter that spread through the dense masses of prisoners as ripples spread from the dropping of a rock in a pond.  | " Silence ! " Osmore screamed , stamping his foot . " Silence ! " He stared balefully from one side of the crowded deck to the other , until the unseemly tittering had died away . " Save your damned Yankee impertinence for another occasionor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You want to see this fight , and you 'll behave yourselves or not see it ! I 'll say this , too : It 's a lesson you need , all of you  --  you French-:lien with your kicking and knife sticking  --  you Spaniards and Italians with your backhanded stilettos and daggers  --  you Yankees with your tomahawks and scalping tricks ! This is to do you good ! You people need all the lessons you can get in the cool courage , the restraint , the skill and the endurancewith which the noble art of boxing has filled the breast of every true-hearted Englishman and made the British nation the mistress of the seas ! " There was a patter of applause from the young women seated at the quarter-deck rail . Newton cleared his throat apologetically . " I 'd like to ask a question , sir , " he said . He stared up at Osmore from besideMarvin , as harmless as a downy chicken peering from under its mother 's wing . " Be quick about it ! " Osmore ordered . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , " Newton urged . " We would n't like to see our man killed or disabled by kicking or gouging when on his back . " Osmore narrowed his eyes at Newton ; then swept them quickly over the throng of ragged men beyond . There was a small trembling among them , and a sound like the vague shadow of stifled laughter . Osmore 's face darkened ; he opened his lips as though to rebuke Newton ; then seemed to cogitate . " Broughton's Rules ! " he snapped at length . " You heard me say Brouglhton'srules ! Get your man ready ! Surgeon Rockett has kindly consented to fill the difficult post of referee . " He read again from his paper . " Corporals Quigg and Spratt will act for  --  ah  --  White  --  for Little ' White . For Marvin , Newton and Argandeau . " Two red-coated marines popped into the ring beside Little White , who straightway leaped into the air , crowing like a rooster and shedding jacket , trousers , waistband and turbanin a whirl of scarlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the brightest green , fastened waist and knee with yellow bands . Above them his naked torso gleamed in the pale October sunlight like polished brown wood  --  wood in which knots and lumps swelled unexpectedly on shoulders , arms and back . His forehead sloped back abruptly from his broad flat nose , rising to a peak at the top of his head  --  a peak topped with a fuzzy semicircle of hair that had the look of a thick rope of crinkly black feathers extending over his skull and fastened to his ears on either side . He continued to crow and leap as Newton helped Marvinto strip off his shirt , the huge brown hands flapping like wings against the green small clothes ; and even his eyes , fastened on Marvin , were black and hard as those of a giant rooster . Marvin , resting against the ropes between Newton and Argandeau , had the look of shrinking from his black antagonist . The pearly whiteness of his chest and arms might have been thought to be the effect of fear , and the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparison with the knobby brown bulges of Little White , almost weak and helpless . Yet it was strange but truep183that whereas Little White seemed to have shrunk somewhat with the removal of his gaudy plumage , Marvin seemed to have become larger . Down from the quarter-deck came the ship 's surgeon , his chin held high by his black stock , and a huge watch clutched in his hand . He crawled beneath the ropes , poked Marvin in the chest with a finger like a marlinespike , stared curiouslyinto the yellowish eyes of Little White ; then stooped over with some difficulty and , on the deck in the middle of the ring , chalked a square with three-foot sides . " Now , " he said , " if you 're ready , my lads ? " He popped out under the ropes . His hand rose and fell ; and with that Newton hustled Marvin to one side of the chalked square , while one of the marines ran with Little White to the opposite side , so that the four men hung in a knot at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoners had fallen away to a breathlesshum , and through the hum rose a hoarse voice , a voice so rough and rasping as to sound less like a voice than like the scraping of a file on the strings of some vast violin . It was the voice of Little White . " Kiss mah han ' , " he growled . " Ah kill Americans will it . " Newton and the marine ran back to their sides of the ring and dodged beneath the ropes . Little White threw himself into fighting position . His left foot and his left arm were thrust well forward ; his right arm guarded his stomach and lower chest ; his upper body tipped back so far that if he had raised his eyes , they would have looked straight upward into infinity . Standing so , he laughed , a deep , roaring , hyena-like laugh ; for it was plain to be seen , from Marvin 's posture , that Marvin was as ignorant of fighting as he was afraid of Little White . He had cramped himself sideways , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His right foot , instead of resting squarely and flatly on the ground as a supporting platform for a blow , was poised on its toe , as , indeed , was his left foot as well . Both his knees were weakly bent , as though it was in his mind to turn at any moment and run like a , coward from his powerful black opponent . Roaring with laughter , Little White shuffled forward toward Marvin , who slipped off to one side . Roaring still , Little White shuffled after him , only to have his opponent slip off to the other side . Nor was Little White the only one to roar . The deck of the hulk seemed almost to erupt with angry shouts of " Fight ! Fight ! " while Osmore , Stannage , the six women in their glowing silks and satins , and even the drummers at each side of the quarter-deck , hung far out over the rail to shout , " Fight ! Fight ! " They moved around the ring , Little White shuffling forward and Marvin slipping off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with a left-handed blow that cut a slit in Marvin 's ear , and got from Marvin in return a veritable baby 's tap  --  a breath of a hit , that touched Little White 's eye and was gone , like a vagrant butterfly . Again , with the evident intention of ending the fight before it had fairly begun , Little White sprang forward , his fists driving like battering rams for Marvin 's mark  --  that triangularshapedpatch beneath his ribs and above his belt . There was the crack of a hit , but it was the impact of a black fist against a forearm ; the mark itself had moved away . The prisoners groaned and hissed . One of them , close to ' Newton 's corner , aimed a jab at the elusive Marvin throughp185the ropes . " Stand up to him ! " he bellowed . " Get out o ' there if you ca n't stand up to him ! " Newton rapped the bellower sharply on the forearm with the edge of his hand . " Close your face ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new way of fighting ? " The near-by prisoners howled their disgust . " Be damned to a new way of fighting ! " " It 's a new way of running , and a rotten one ! " " Make him show what he 's good for ! " " Make him fight ! " Minutes passed . Blood trickled from Marvin 's ear ; there were red welts along his ribs from the glancing blows of Little White 's knuckles ; but still he slipped off to one side or to the other , and shrank away before the black man 's advance . Anger had replaced Little White 's hoarse hilarity . " Stan ' still ! " he growled , following Marvin 's erratic twistings and turnings . " Is n't one of you Americans got bottom enough to stan ' up to a fighter ? Light somewheres , you dirty Yankee yaller bird , so 's I can knock you halfway up to Lunnon ! " To Little White 's amazement , Marvin laughed . " You ca n't fight ! " he told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross-buttock . " Little White lowered his head and charged . To the prisoners , raging at Marvin 's tactics , it seemed , and was indeedthe case , that Marvin , at this quick movement , stood his ground instead of slipping off to right or left . As Little White 's head shot past his body , Marvin 's fist came up against his opponent 's throat with a sound like the impact of a dead codfish against a plank . In another instant the black man 's arms were around him and the first fall had gone to Little White with a cross-buttock.  | Their seconds were on them as they sprawled to the deck , hoisting them to their feet and hurrying them to the ropes for a rest of thirty seconds . Argandeau held Marvin on his knee while Newton , gabbling in his ear to make himself heard above the din of the prisoners , sponged the blood from his face and chest . " A thirteen-minute round ! " Newton told him excitedly . " A thirteen-minute round , and you 're barely scratched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round a frigate ! He ca n't touch you ! Keep it up , Dan ! Your way 's the best way , no matter what these fools say ! Do n't listen to ' em ! He ca n't fight ! He 's a flipper ! I told you he was a flipper ! He thinks he 's fighting like Molineaux , but he is n't . He 's just a big black chunk of sour beef ! He hits at half arm and keeps his elbows close to his body , and he 'll keep doing it until he thinks he 's caught you ! Then he 'll imitate Molineaux again and try to chop you , and you 've got him ! You 've got him anyway ! That was a beauty  --  a beauty ! Right in the whistle ! Right in the apple ! He thinks he 's swallowed a hen 's hind foot ! Oh , oh ! He 's fat ! He 's puffy ! And he thinks it was an accident ! He thinks he ran into it ! Look at him gulp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across at Little White , seated on the knee of a red-coated marine while another marine dabbled water on the back of his neck . There was , Marvin saw , a soft smoothness to the black skin above the green small clothes , instead of the solid wall of corrugated muscle that should have been there ; and the soft smooth surface rose and fell hurriedly . Conscious of Marvin 's scrutiny , Little White blinked his small eyes , cautiously stretched his neck ; then . thrust out his mouth in an apelike grimace.  | " Keep away from him ! " Newton continued . " Keep out of his way until he 's careless ! Then you got him ! Then you got him good ! Remember what I told you ! " " Time ! " the referee shouted . Little White shuffled to the chalked square , falling into a fighting position so exaggerated that he seemed on the verge of tumbling backward . Marvin came less quickly to the scratch , and in the same cautious manner that had so enragedhis fellow prisoners in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his body bent as though he were torn with the simultaneous desire to advance and to run away . Little White 's hands revolved rapidly and he pawed the deck with an enormous foot . " Stan ' up ! " he commanded hoarsely ; then coughed and cleared his throat and coughed once more . " Stan ' up , you ole tabby cat ! " He lurched forward to hurl murderous blows at Marvin , who shrank before him , ducking and dodging . Again and yet again Marvin 's left fist flicked out , touching Little White lightly at the corner of the eye , and so faint and ineffectual were the blows that the groans and the jeering of the prisonerschanged suddenly to a burst of laughter . Even Little White laughed , though he coughed when he did so , and at the corner of his eyes a smear of blood showed bright against his brown skin . " Jes ' a moment and I gits you ! " he said . His voice seemed choked and strangled , and when he had spoken , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , there came a hesitationinto Marvin 's movements  --  a momentary catch , as though he had faltered in deciding how to turn . Little White bellowed hoarsely ; his right hand rose high above his head , and like a flail his long black arm swept down toward Marvin 's neck . Instead of slipping away , Marvinmoved closer . His right fist flashed upward to land upon the brown V below the ribs . The breath went out of Little White with a hoarse hoot . He tilted suddenly forward , so that his chopping blow lost its force and landed uncontrolled , against Marvin 's shoulder . Marvin 's left fist drove once more against the negro 's thick throat , partially straightening the black man , and once more his right fist whipped into the unprotected stomach that still quivered and jerked from the first unexpected blow . Little White clung to him with one arm  --  clung and fell backward , dragging Marvin with him ; and the two of them plunged to the deck amid a turmoil of frenzied shouting such as might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-fed prisoners . Newton , dragging Marvin back to his seat on Argandeau'sknee , shook like a shivered sail ; and his voice trembled even more than his hands . " You got him ! You got him ! " He rubbed the blood from Marvin 's cheek and ribs , and laughed almost hysterically . " It worked the way you said it would , and you got him ! " " Time ! " bellowed Surgeon Rockett , above the howling of the prisoners . Argandeau pushed Marvin toward the chalked square ; and as Little White , coughing and blinking , stepped warily to the other side , Marvin snapped his left fist toward the black man 's face . The semblance of timidity and indecision was gone from him , and he had the look of one who has come to the end of long waiting . Yet this look went from his face , quickly enough ; for as he led with his left hand , Little White half turned , threw up his head and fell to the floor.  |p189In  the same moment his second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragged him back to the ropes . Marvin , staring helplessly at Little White , felt Newton take him by the arm . " Wait ! " Marvin said . He turned to the surgeon , who stood pompously outside the ring , staring at his turnip-shaped watch . " Wait ! He fell without a blow ! That 's no fall ! I did n't hit him ! " The surgeon looked up at him slowly . " You did n't what ? " lie asked . " You heard me ! " Marvin said . " I did n't touch him ! Get him back here and make him fight ! " The surgeon laughed fatly . " You 're a fine one to talk about fighting  --  you who did nothing but run for half an hour ! " " For God 's sake ! " Marvin shouted . " You " He stopped , staring at the pompous surgeon ; then hurried to where Argandeau waited for him with outthrust knee . Argandeau patted his shoulder , soothing him . " Remember ; I have told you about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone to contemplating the face of his watch again . " A minute and a half he 's given him ! " Newton said . " Well , Dan ; you do your best ! " " Time ! " said the surgeon . Marvin ran to scratch . Little White , breathing more regularly , glowered malevolently at him . Marvin grinned amiably . " You 're licked , black boy ! You 're going to get hurt for playing tricks ! " Little White coughed and growled . Marvin slapped his outstretched left arm , a slap that tilted him forward ; and as he tilted , Marvin 's left fist landed wetly against his eye . Little White coughed and groaned . With hamlike hands he hammered Marvin 's ribs . Marvin staggered and laughed ;  | then rushed at Little White and drove him backward with a succession of blows to the stomach . He fell against the rope of the ring and bounced upright . When Marvin hit him in the throat and again in the stomach , he slipped to one knee and clung to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He bit me ! " Marvin caught him by the fringe of hair atop his head , dragged him to his feet and drove his fist against his throat . The negro fell heavily to the deck , made vague swimming motions with his hands , and then lay still . " Foul ! Foul ! " shouted Osmore and Stannage . The pompous surgeon popped through the ropes . " Foul ! " he said , brandishing his watch in Marvin 's face . " The man was down ! " " No foul ! No foul ! " screamed the prisoners . " No ! " Marvin shouted . " Both knees and at least one hand ' on the floor , or the man 's not down , and you know it ! They 're your own rules ! He 's down now , but he was n't when I hit him . Do n't look at me ! Look at your watch , you fat swab ! " He ran to Argandeau 's knee . The marine came through the ropes and dragged Little White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , patting his head , his back , his thighs . A breathless silence came upon the . prisoners while they , waited for the passing of the thirty seconds at whose end , according to Broughton 's Rules , each fighter must either toe the mark once more or acknowledge defeat . Through this silence could be clearly heard the sound of Newton 's hands , slapping and kneading Marvin 's arms , and of his reiterated , whisper  --  " He 'll never make it , Dan ! He 'll never make it ! He 'll never make it ! He 'll never make it ! "  |p191The  surgeon pushed the watch in his pocket . He leaned over to look at Little White ; then stared venomously at Marvin . " Time ! " he said slowly . " Time ! " Marvin walked to the chalk mark in the center of the ring . He stood there alone . In the opposite comes lay Little White . Marvin , watching him , saw one black eyelid flutter . The marine pulled at the negro 's arm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screamed ; and as if the scream had been a signal , the hulk became a bedlam of cursing , uproarious prisoners . Newton , uttering unintelligible sounds , clambered through the ropes to throw his arms around Marvin 's neck . Argandcau , tears streaming down his cheeks , embraced them both . " We win ! " he blubbered . " Ah , my God ! My God ! I am excite ! I choke ! I die ! We win ! We win ! " Above them Stannage shook his fist at the prostrate form of Little White . " I 've been sold ! " he cried in his girlish voice . He leaned over the rail to point an accusing finger at Marvin . " You had no right to win ! There was something wrong with it , but I do n't know what ! You do n't deserve your twenty guineas , and I 've a mind not to give them to you ! " He stared about him indecisively , as if to seek support . Finding none , he fumbled in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them petulantly to Marvin ; then turned suddenly to Osmore . " Here , " he said . " Where 's my dog ? I 've been wanting to ask you all through the fight . Look at that ! " He held up the empty strap and dangled it in Osmore 's face . Osmore stared at it blankly . " Your dog ? " he asked . " Your dog is gone ? When did you see him last ? " " After dinner , " Stannage said . " One of the ladies was feeding him a sweet . "  | " What ? You were foolish enough to let that dog run loose on this ship ! " Osmore cried aghast . " I told you a week ago we had more than a dozen of these men sick from eating rats ! " Captain Stannage turned pallidly toward his six fair friends , whose sympathetically dismal exclamations pierced the air , yet went all unheard , lost under the thunder of cheeringfrom the ragged deck below.  |p193ALTHOUGH  an early afternoon sun slanted through the heavily barred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a turmoil of sound , and the noisiest portion of that cavernous place was the corner in which Newton 's hammock hung at night . In that corner was a school of fencing in which three pairs of fencers lunged and panted , their blades rasping and their clumsy shoes a-clatter . In that corner , too , between the fencers and the ports , a dozen men from Kittery and Portsmouth worked with files and saws , fashioning tiny planks from soup bones . As they worked , they argued ; and their arguments were deafening . Behind this human screen four men were stretched upon the deck , close to the planking of the vessel 's side . Sweat dripped from their foreheads and cut furrows through the grime that smeared their cheeks . Their breathing was labored and their work unceasing . One , an Indian , drew a small bow backward and forward . The string of the bow was looped around a drill , a small drill made from a broken fencing foil . Marvin , beside the Indian , held this rude tool tight against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of a bottle . The bowstring , moving rapidly , turned the drill , so that it bit slowly into the oak . Argandeau , strangely cramped , toiled with a saw made from a barrel hoop , joining the holes already drilled . The handle of the saw was a ball of rags ; and the hand with which the Frenchman clutched it was bloody . Between and beneath these three moved Newton , filling holes and cuttings with a mixture of grease and oak dust . At two o'clock that night a bitter wind slapped the salt - waves of Gillingham Reach against the bends of the Crown Prince hulk . The hulk strained at her moorings and rolled a little , as if uneasy with the stirrings of the miserable freight within her . A shivering sentry paced the narrow gallery three feet above the water . He came reluctantly from behind the shelter of the stern , peered with moist eyes at the distant lights of Gillingham , bawled a hoarse " All 's well ! " ; then vanished silently , seeking the protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackness of the misshapen vessel there sprouted a splotch of paleness  --  a splotch that lengthened into the naked figure of a man ; a figure smeared with grease and humpbacked with a bundle lashed high on its shoulders . Almost like a wisp of wind-blown fog , it wavered outward from the hulk and disappeared . Three other figures followed , wraithlike , to plunge without a sound into the dark river . The sentry reappeared , snuffling . He peered quickly at the inky water and the bulging sides of the hulk . " All 's well ! " he droned , his voice trembling with the cold ; then , huddled turtle-like in his greatcoat , he shuffled hastily sternwardto escape the wind 's shrewd blast . The frigid chop of the Medway stung the faces of the four swimmers . The swift current wrenched at their legs and pressed like violent icy hands against their chests . Close together , they swam onward into the endless blackness thatp195stretched before them and weighed them down . White gouts of foam rose angrily to leap at their twisted mouths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms thrashed and the quick current bore him upstream . He cried a strangled cry , and choked . Marvin 's voice was close beside him  --  a strained and harried voice : " Easy . . . almost there . . . almost . . . . Easy ! " Newton groaned and moved forward slowly , half in the shelter of Marvin 's great body . The piercing wind flagged and lulled , leaped at them halfheartedlyand lulled again . The angry chop lessened and slapped less fiercely at their numb lips . The water stilled ; the current slackened  --  almost drew them shoreward . Marvinstood upright , caught at Newton and held him . He hung limp in Marvin 's arms , coughed weakly and gagged . A smell of cold decay hung over them . There was a faint splashing near at hand . Half swimming and half crawling , Argandeau came up to them , with Steven close behind . In Marvin 's arms , Newton groaned and coughed again . The other three stared , panting , at the dim and noisome mud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shallows . Marvin eyed him , then turned from him abruptly and made for the shore . At the water 's edge he sank knee-deep in ooze . Gripped by it , he lurched from side to side in a slow and clumsy caper . Laboriously he withdrew one foot and then the other ; and with the effort there was a sound of sucking and the issuing of a stench , dank and horrible . He lost his balance , pitching forward against the foul gray slope . His arms , thrust downward for support , disappeared ; and when he struggled to his feet , the arms were black with slime . His face was black , and his body as werr . He threw himself flat on the bank and wallowed forward ,  |p196s|piderlike  . Huddled on the slope , he gasped an order to Argandeau , who laid hold of Newton and hurled him roughly upward . Marvin reached backward , caught Newton by the hair and dragged him to his side . " Move ! " Marvin told him hoarsely , his voice as thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or you 'll sink ! " They squirmed and rolled on the yielding , quaking mud like two hurt animals . Argandeau and the Indian floundered upward through the slime to lie , spent , beyond them . Marvin gained his feet , heaving at Newton 's frail body . Argandeau reached back a hand , and between them they dragged and pushed , their small companion over the crest of the slope and to the flat surface of the bank  --  a surface that shook like jelly and sucked hungrily at their naked bodies . This trembling mass was soft as glue , seeming to have no substance . In it their feet sought vainly for a hold , and while they sought , the surface clutched their upper legs and drew them deeper . Gripped by this noxious treacle , the four black figures reeled forward in a wavering and dreadful dance . Gasping , they wrenched themselves half free , only to sink again and on the instant strive once more for partial freedom . They groaned and sweated in the bitter wind . Mud filled their eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seeing nothing and hearing only faintly the rattle of his labored breathing . They lurched and fell and rose ; and with each move , the slime in which they groveled was vocal , seeming to smack its lips and slobber at their agony . There was a flame in Marvin 's chest  --  a flame that stabbed and crackled . Dark fears smoked upward from it , and the weakness of despair . Through its cracklings Newton 's thinp197voice reached him  --  a voice shrill with terror . " Dan ! " it called , " Dan ! Wait ! I ca n't  --  ca n't " Marvin floundered toward the voice and got his hands on Newton . " Stuck ! " Newton gasped . " Ca n't make it ! " Panting , Marvin dragged at the smaller man , who retched . The mud held him . Marvin groaned and heaved , and Newton , struggling weakly , came slowly out . Marvin 's legs churned in the stinking ooze . He fell backward in it , pitching Newton over him in his fall . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reaching for support , found only slimy thickness , into which his weary legs and body settled . Cold sickness caught his throat . Small homely pictures of his youth swam slowly through his brain : Himself , a boy once more , bathing his scrawny body in a lamp-lit kitchen beneath his mother 's watchful glance ; a nest of helpless field mice on the hot Arundel marshes ; a sweaty minister with uplifted eyes , droning hell and endless torment , and in a near-by pew Corunna Dorman , eyeing him aslant through fingers that devoutly screened her face . Up through these little pictures came the face of Slade , staring and smiling in sardonic mirth . In desperation Marvin reared and twisted . Uncomprehendinglyhe heard a splashing near at hand . Fingers clawed his ear ; clutched at his arm and slipped ; then clutched again . Marvin wallowed forward , hung on a sloping surfaceand rolled heavily into the water of the lagoon that lay between the mud bank and the meadows of Gillingham . The distant hulks bulked against the paleness of the comingdawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Kent lay four exhausted men , sick from their efforts , but for the moment safe.  |p198A  BLIND Hindu , his face shadowed by a soiled and bulbousturban and his bare brown shoulders protruding from the folds of once-white cotton in which he was swathed , sat by the dusty roadside on the outskirts of the small Channel town of Ramsgate , while his ragged attendant , a sharpnosed , tow-headed youth , directed the attention of passers= by to the brown man 's peculiar ability . " ' E kin mike fire will nuffin but a bit o ' string an ' a toofpick ! Couple o ' coppers , friends , fer to see a sight you 'll be a-tellin ' your children abaht fer the next ' undred years ! " A few citizens of Ramsgate stood stolidly before the two , seemingly hopeful that the requisite pennies would be donated by others . Two sentries , evidently stationed on the edge of the town for the inspection of strangers , peered over the shoulders of the citizens . A provision cart , laden with straw and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slouching countrymen on the driver 's seat tossed two pennies into the dust at the brown man 's feet . The sharp-nosed youth seized them ; then shook the Hindu 's bare brown arm . " ' Ere ! " he cried . " Git it alit ! " The brown man , fumbling in his cotton swathings , produced a small board , a pointed stick and a diminutive bow . Then , his sightless eyes staring over the heads of his audience , he looped the string of the bow around the stick and adjusted its point to a depression in the board . Thep199bow moved rapidly ; the pointed stick spun round . From the depression in the board rose a faint wisp of smoke . The audience shifted and murmured . The horse of the provision cart , panic-struck , bolted forward into Ramsgate . The driver , shouting angrily , rose to his feet and sawed at the reins ; but so keen was the interest of the audience in the smoke rising from the depression in the Hindu 's board that not even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse slowed to a walk and stared around reproachfullyat the driver . The cart skirted the sandy beach of Ramsgate and bore off toward the sheltering chalk cliff under which twoscore cutters , luggers and other small craft lay at anchor . Somnolent men in blue jerseys reclined against ancient docks and wharf houses , seemingly oblivious to both the cart and its occupants . The cart came at length to a decrepit house in the doorwayof which sat a whiskered man with bare feet . At sight of the carters he thrust a great toe through the meshes of a seine to hold it taut , while with his teeth and his two hands he set busily to work repairing a rip . The driver , a tall man with knuckles strangely scarred , stared down at the net mender . " How 's fishing ? " he asked . The whiskered man replied cryptically that there was a hole in nearly every net . " I was told , " Marvin said , " that a net mender by the name of Clay in Ramsgate was needing some poultry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man said . He withdrew his great toe from the seine and came to examine the hens in the back of the cart . " Aye , " he added , " them 's ' ens , them is ! " Under his breath he added with an air of finality ? " Cost you ten guineas heach . Ten guineas to Calais . "  | " No , not Calais , " Marvin said . " Morlaix . " Clay shook his head . " Calais , you 'll go to , " he replied sourly . " Calais , and lucky to get there . " He snorted . " Mot laix ! What you think we 're running here ? Blooming hexcursionboats ? " Marvin stared hard at the net mender and drew a deep . breath . Before he could speak , Argandeau murmured quickly in his ear . Marvin laughed , glanced appraisingly at the sky and vaulted lightly from the cart . " Calais it is , " he said , " at tell guineas a man . There 's two more of us on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old sheet , doing tricks , and a 1 y leading him . Bring ' em in safe and we 'll show you the color of our money . " It was close on to midnight when Clay put them aboard the lugger Hirondelle ; and the captain , a squat Frenchman with legs so bowed a full-grown pig could have run between them without touching either , welcomed them politely and locked them in the lugger 's tiny cabin . To the four men , huddled in the dark , came the rattle of the lug sail rising . The Hirondelle 's head fell off and the little vessel pitched uneasily in the Channel chop . Argandeau fumbled at the cabin door . " Yes , " he said , " this lock has four small fastenings . You bore beside them , and we wrench it off  --  Pouff ! Like that ! " He snapped his fingers . The Indian crouched beside him , and there began a sound of gnawing  --  a sound so faint that it was lost in the screakingsof the lugger 's hull and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door banged open , and the four men tumbledp20Iinto the cockpit . Three of them scrambled forward . Argandeauremained behind , smiling amiably into the lugger captain 's horror-stricken face . " A friendly visit , this , " he ventured . " It is too cold and lonely in that cabin , eh ? So we come out to suggest that you journey more to the southward , where it is a little warmer , perhaps . " " To the southward ? " the captain asked incredulously . " Truly ! " Argandeau agreed . " To Morlaix . A beautiful town , Morlaix . You know Morlaix , perhaps ? The women are beautiful to a degree . " " Morlaix ! " the captain cried . " Why should I venture to Morlaix ? You desire that I should lose my occupation ? Name of a pig , but if I risk my beautiful Hirondelle on the long trip to Morlaix , I shall certainly do so ! " " If you fear to lose a situation , " Argandeau told him sententiously , " abandon it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lugger captain laughed bitterly . " A better one ! I will be forced to become a Flushing or Middelburg man , carryingbrandy to Ireland . To Ireland ! My God , there is a dangerous affair ! " " Listen ! " Argandeau said . He reached for the tiller and pushed it over . The lugger 's head fell off and the little vesselran more easily down the Channel . " Listen . You are a man of Calais , no ? " " Sacred heart ! " the lugger captain wailed . " Calais , yes ! " " Yes , " Argandeau said , " and you have then heard of Tom Souville , perhaps . " The lugger captain stared at him . " Heard of Tom Sou. ville ! " he exclaimed . " What do you think ? Am I a dead man ? Every man who is not a dead man has heard of Tom Souville ! "  | " Truly ! " Argandeau murmured . " Truly and truly ! " the lugger captain agreed . " Four times that fox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast foreign substances in the eyes of the British . Yes , I know him ! Every man knows him ! The English know him well ! In his Renard , three days since , he has captured anotherEnglish brig  --  a strong armed brig ! You know this Souville ? " " Do I know him ? " Argandeau asked . " Do I know my own nose ? I think yes ! We are like brother and brother together ; like fish and potatoes ! " " Ah ! " the lugger captain exclaimed . " But yes ! " Argandeau said . " You return to Calais and say to Tom Souville that you have done this for Lucie Argandeau , and he kiss you on both cheeks , like this ! " I lc embraced the lugger captain and kissed him . " He will make your position more secure than Mont Blanc ! That is something , eh ? " " That is something ! " the lugger captain agreed . I le crouched behind the gunwale and lighted a short pipe that smelled like smoldering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we reach Morlaix at sixteen o'clock , I think yes . "  |p203THE  fat landlady of the Queen of Scotland tavern in the fish-scented town of Morlaix raised her thick shoulders and strove to widen her eyes above her fleshy cheeks . " Ah ! " she exclaimed to the tall , roughly dressed man who stood before her high desk . " Ah , but I was sorry for that lady , you understand . She was desperate , poor little one ! I knew ; yes . Her back , it remained straight and beautiful ; but me , Victorine , I knew ! She was penniless and desperate ! Indeed , yes ! Not that I would have pressed her , ever ! No ! But I was sorry  --  yes , sorry  --  and then her friend arrived . " The landladysighed , and from the vicinity of her enormous bosom came faint creakings . Marvin stared at her from under heavy brows . " A friend ? She did n't have any ! She did n't know anyone here ! " The landlady breathed heavily and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but yes ! It was a man  --  ah , very much ! One with fascination in his face and in his movements . Oh , a very good friend of hers ! He knew her well ; for he had been with the poor little one on the ship before all the misfortuneof that great loss . Then he had gone somewhere for a time . " Her beady eyes peered out at him from rolls of fat . " To Roscoff  --  I do not know . It is no matter . He was a fine gentleman . His costume was rich ! A fine coat ! A fine hat ! Ah  --  ah , all of the costume rich ! And he paid well , that one ! " Her eyes blinked eagerly at him . " He paid very well  --  very much ! "  | " You think she was glad ? " Marvin whispered huskily . The landlady 's eyes flicked across Marvin 's stained and wrinkled trousers and his broken shoes . " Yes , " she said , " she seemed very fond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , very ! And why not , eh ? She had a figure , that one ! A back so straight and flat I have never seen ! No ! She brought trade ; I will not conceal it ! There was a roundness to her that men came here to see . And this friend of hers , he had an air . It was something to be whispered to by that man , I think ! " She shuddered softly . " They were a couple , that pair ! Two cabbages , eh ? I see them now , departing by the Paris coach . Me , Victorine , I would give one bottle of brandy to know the words he whispered as they left . " Her laugh was oily and her eyes were hidden by the rolls of fat . Marvin looked at her for one moment longer ; then turned abruptly and walked to the door . He walked decisively , yet his steps were unsteady ; and the landlady , watching him , ceased to laugh . Her piggish glance dwelt coldly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contemptuous puff , like the breathing of a rolling porpoise . Three men waited in the narrow street before the Queen of Scotland tavern . They stared silently at the grayness of Marvin 's face as he came heavily toward them . Argandeau cleared his throat . " My friend , you have learned something . You like to tell us what it is ? " Marvin nodded slowly . " Slade , " he said . " It was Slade that did it  --  Slade that fixed us . " He studied his clenched fist . " It was Slade , " he repeated numbly . " He 's got money .  --  plenty of it . " The three men watched him , and when he was silent ,  |p205Newton  stirred uneasily . " The lady you spoke of , " he ventured  --  " didyou learn about her ? " Marvin lifted his eyes to the dull November sky ; then lowered them moodily to Newton 's face and slowly shook his head . " Nothing . " " You learned nothing ? " Argandeau cried . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became of her ! Come ; we go again and ask ! " Marvin eyed him . " Nothing , I said ! " he repeated flatly . " Nothing ! Henceforth nothing ! " Argandeau drew a long breath and nodded understandingly . " I see ! I see ! We can not speak of her ! " He lifted an eyebrow . " We can not speak of her , and so we will not ; but we can speak of Slade , eh ? We can consider Slade ! " " Yes , " Marvin said . " We 'll consider Slade . " " Eh ? And find him first ? " " Yes . I 'm going to find him . " " Ah , when you find him , " Argandeau said , " that will be something to enjoy . " He pirouetted on the cobbles of the narrow street . " Where do we go to find him , my friend ? " " Paris , " Marvin said . " That is a city that is a city , " Argandeau remarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find him ? " " I do n't know , " Marvin said . " I do n't know . " Argandeau snapped his fingers . " Do not despair , dear Dan ! Here in France there are men whose business it is to know many things . I think I can find a man to tell us of this Slade . You have heard of this man  --  Tom Souville of Calais ? He is like to burst with the infinity of the things he knows ! Come ; we go quickly to Calais ! "  | IT WAS early morning when Argandeau led his three companionsbetween the warehouses of the Quai de Keroualle and out onto the egg-shaped cobbles of the dock itself , slimy from the cold drizzle that turned the buildings , the shipping and the harbor of Calais into a uniform dirty gray . Two vessels lay before them  --  one a tall and graceful schooner , and the other a small brig that squatted behind the schooner like a drab and dumpy mallard duck paddling ignominiously after a spotless swan . At the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at work in the brig 's rigging , stood a plump , helpless looking man in whose appearance there was no evidence of wealth , seamanship or profound knowledge . Yet this helpless-looking man was of necessity Tom Souville ; for it was to him that Argandeau ran , and to him he spoke , bowingas handsomely , when he did so , as though clad in the finest broadcloth and satin , instead of the miserable shag trousers and striped shirt with which Clay had supplied him in Ramsgate . There was something of timidity to Souville when he turned , at Argandeau 's first words . His lips were slack ; his eyes were wide ; all in all he had the air of a person about whom there was little to fear and less to remember . In the moment of seeing Argandeau , however , his face broadened and hardened in a thin-lipped grin , and he seized Argandeau by the upper arms , seeming almost to wrestlep207with him . As he did so , Marvin saw , over Argandeau 's shoulder , Souville 's eye flicker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stooping hawk . When , a moment later , he came to them , his eyes were wide and gentle and his smile diffident as he complimented them on their escape from the hulks of Chatham . " I do not need to ask how are you , " he said . " You are happy men , alive and free where only a short time ago you were half dead and sealed in the tomb . I myself have known this feeling more than once . This rain seems not to be rain , eh ? The whole world seems bright , and nothing too much for your efforts . " " I have told them this , Captain , " Argandeau assured him . " Nothing is too much , if they have the great Captain Souvilleto direct them . " A look so vacuous as to approach imbecility swept over Souville 's face and clung there until Marvin , nodding his head at the small brig , observed calmly that she was a tidy craft . " We heard you took her , " Marvin said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good ! " Souville said quickly . " Good ! Not too good , but good ! You know there is nothing sails with my Renard -- not even any French schooner , and you well know that there are no vessels so fast as our French vessels . Therefore this Challenger sails well , but not so well but what I could sail a circle around her in any weather . " He canted his head a little backward toward the harbor , his face as fatuous as that of a father indicating an adored child . " You have had an eye for my Renard , no doubt ? " " Yes , " Marvin said , eyeing the tall schooner tied up beyond the brig 's bows , " yes , she 's a fine craft ! If I could : Ake out a craft like that , I 'd make five million francs for her owners if I made a sou . " He stared from her to the squat and clumsy brig . " I 've sometimes thought , though , that this talk of the speed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It appears to me I 've seen English vessels that could sail with the best of French vessels , provided the English manned their craft with seamen instead of peasants and city boys . " " No , no ! " Souville said amiably . " Look here at this Challenger brig . Her lines are not bad , but she is too narrow , and heavy beyond all need . Her yards are thick , like an Englishwoman 's leg , and her bulkheads are like making a wineglass from a block of granite ! " Marvin nodded . " Yes , but this is not the only English vessel in the world . There was an English schooner came into Morlaix a month ago and cut out our barque , the Olive Branch . Now , there was a schooner ! " Souville smiled pityingly . " No , no ! That Sparrow schooner , she is not much . In light airs , now , my Renard would leave her so fast she would seem anchored . " Marvin turned suddenly to Souville . " Why , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You must have heard the whole tale , or you 'd never know the schooner 's name . That was it  --  the Sparrow ! If you know it was she that cut us out , you 'll know what became of an officer who left her on the day she made port . " Souville 's lower lip slackened , and into his eyes there came a blankness that was almost witlessness . " An officer , " he asked . " An officer left her ? " A heavy silence descended on the little group of men  --  a silence broken at last by Argandeau : " There is something wrong here , my old friend , " he said . " For some reason yon ;  |p209ward  yourself against us , and I think you know too much or too little . " Ile moved closer to Souville , making him a dignified half bow . " You suspect something , Captain ; but I swear to you , by the friendship of our youth , there is no reason ! These men are my friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further the cause of France by doing England a hart . This young man "  --  he flicked his finger tips lightly against Marvin 's breast  --  " is a seaman , cautious with the pectiliar caution of his country , and capable of inflicting great damage on an enemy . I have watched him  --  I , Lucien Argandeau  --  and I tell you that in one hour 's time he thinks how to do things better and more quickly than they have ever before been done . " Souville raised his hands and let them fall helplessly . " I have heard only a little ; so little that it is nothing . This officer , perhaps , had an eye partly obscured . " He threw back his head , drooped one eyelid and looked quickly at Marvin , so that he seemed to peer out from under the loweredlid . Marvin nodded , and Argandeau cursed softly in a foreign tongue . " You knew this man ? " Souville asked . " Knew him ! " Marvin said grimly . " Slade set the English on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " So you had heard it ? " Souville said . " How did it happen that you heard it ? " Argandeau laughed . " How does it happen you know there will be rain tomorrow ? It is something you know . This Slade , he was our enemy . I , too , am sure  --  very sure  --  he sent the Griffons , the English , to cut out the Olive Branch . How he informed them , I do not know , but be went ashore , the day we made port , and disappeared . The next thing we know , the Sparrow arrives , comic ; purposely for us . It is a strange thing , too , that the officials of Morlaix held us and held us , anchored in the estuary , refusing to let us break bulk . These Americans , they might have been enemies of France , from the way they were treated ! " Souville pinched his lower lip between his thumb and forefinger , squeezing a part of the seeming imbecility fro in his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection between this Slade and the behavior of the Morlaix officials ? You think he might be an enemy to France as well as to yourself ? " Marvin nodded . " He was a slave captain , and slave captainscannot live except by bribery . He was an enemy to everybody and everything that would keep him from getting ; what he wanted ; and the thing he wanted most "  --  Marvin hesitated momentarily  --  " was money . " Souville looked hard at Marvin and then at Argandeau . " All in all , then , " he said , " you consider him a dangerous man ? " Argandeau laughed angrily . " Dangerous ! He should have a knife in the back ; or if you are too squeamish for that , lie , should be hustled to Verdun and placed in the dungeons for the remainder of this little war ! Tell us where he is , my friend ! " Souville seemed suddenly enlightened . " Ah , I did not understand , " he said . " In wartime it is impossible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathywith the man . Now you shall have everything front me , frankly and freely . We will remove ourselves from this wet , eh , and go aboard my Renard , where we can speak quietly over a bottle of the best brandy . "  |p211He  turned abruptly , no longer anything of helplessness or Indecision about him , swaggered to the companionway of the tall schooner , and led the way over her side and to the after hatch . Marvin , bringing up the rear of the small procession , paused for a moment at the bulwarks to study the bows of the squat brig beyond the Renard 's stern ; then continued , whistling softly , downward into Souville 's quarters . From the dark stains on the floor , as well as from the red paint on the patched sheathing , Marvin saw that the Renard 's barren cabin had often been used as a hospital during engagements ; and Souville , rummaging in a chest for a bottle , while the others settled themselves on benches , replied volubly to Marvin 's unspoken thoughts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Well , that is so ! My Renard , she goes always on business ; and the quicker the business is done , the quicker we return home , ch ? Therefore , I want little here for the making of splinters ; little that must be thrown overboard before an engagement ; for any such throwing would take time . In three months I shall have a larger vessel , with more comforts , perhaps ; but I am wise to keep my Renard clear and clean like the noudoir of a young girl , eh ? " He poured brandy into small glasses , squinted through one of them , touched the glass to Iris lips ; then rolled his eyes ecstatically . " I drink your health and good fortune , gentlemen ! The Americans , they are our clear friends and brothers against a common enemy . " " We came here to speak of Slade , " Marvin reminded him . " Yes , yes , " Souville said . " Now I tell you ! I see how you have suffered through this Slade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left your barque , he went to England , where he sold information to the Admiralty for a largep212amount of money , perhaps fifteen thousand pounds ; and ha went then to certain merchants of Bristol who are engaged in the slave trade contrary to law , and threatened them with exposure unless they provided him with an armed vessel  --  a fast armed vessel . " Argandeau bounced from his bench , stamped twice on flit floor , spat violently through a stern window and threw himselfheavily on the bench again . " An armed vessel ? " Marvin asked slowly . " What sort of vessel ? " Souville shrugged his shoulders . " I have not heard , but ' , probably a brig . The fastest ones are brigs . Later I shall know surely . " Marvin sighed gently . " Then he has n't got it yet . Thank God ! " Souville shook his head . " No , and I am told that another month must pass before he gets it , but he had money from these Englishmen  --  a deal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roscoff , he wrangled with the  --  ahwiththe young woman who had accompanied him on his travels  --  a young woman who came to me with the tale . An interesting man , this Slade . He had promised to pay this young woman fifty pounds for favors received , but on leavinghe would give her no more than twenty . " " There was a traveling companion , indeed 1 " Argandeau remarked . Newton wagged his head in simulated admiration . " He 'll bear watching , Slade will . He 'd go far in politics or finance ! " " You say Slade returned from England , " Marvin remindedSouville . " What then ? " " Why , " Souville said , " then he went straight to Mor/laix and to Paris . As soon as we had word from England of his activities , we traced him carefully . " He frowned . " If only we had known two days earlier , we would have had hint and there would have been one more enemy safe in the dungeons of Verdun ! He moves quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paris ; then he is gone , like a puff of smoke , back to England  --  back to his dear friends in Bristol . We have lost him , I fear . I hope it is not so , but I fear it . " " Back to England ! " Marvin said . " He went back to England ! " He groaned , and moved to the stern windows of the Renard , to stand staring down at the brig whose long jib boom rose above the Renard 's taffrail ; then turned suddenly to eye the small and pompous Souville . Surprisingly , he laughed . " I 'll tell you what I 'll do , Captain : I 'll capture Slade myself and make some money for you in the bargain , if you 'll supply me with the means of doing it . " Souville looked at him blankly . " Supply you ? I do not understand ! " Marvin set down his glass and tapped the table with his forefinger . " Captain , " he said , " you 're playing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know ; but what happens to her , fast as she is , if you 're caught by a frigate on a lee shore some foggy morning ? At the worst , she 's torn to pieces and you 're killed . At the best , the English take her . Then you and your men go back to the hell of an orlop deck on a British hulk , and the fevers and bloody fluxes and black pneumonias that make the hulks as rotten as the meat they give you to gag on . You know what they are better than I do . " Souville smiled comfortably . " You talk like my wife . " " I drink to her wisdom , " Marvin replied . " It 's the truth ,  |p214What  's more , you 'll catch a Tartar some day  --  somebo ( ly who knows how to shoot better than you do . Look at this brig you just brought in ! Shot to pieces in her yards an  --  I sails and rigging , but not a shot in her hull ! If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you would n't have got her at all . Is n't that so ? " " Never ! " Souville declared indignantly . " It is not so . " Marvin rose again , went to the side of the cabin a ( 1 rapped his knuckles against the sheathing . " An egg-shell , " he said , " like so many French private vessels . Everything sacrificed to speed ! A little bad luck , and she 'd crumble under you . You would n't have got the brig if she 'd sliT ) t straight and cleared your deck of boarders . " " But you would like to have this egg-shell of mine , " Souville observed complacently . " Ah , " Marvin said , " but I 've made a discovery that would make her safe ! I 've learned how to lie cuff at a safe distance and batter a vessel to pieces with a long gun . I 've learned how to lay guns in smoke with a raw crew . " " And never miss , eh ? " Souville scoffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's the discovery . " " There is no way to do it , " Souville said . " Yes , " Marvin insisted . " I 've invented a way . It can be done with a pendulum  --  a gangway pendulum . " Souville , plucking at an end of his small mustache , seemed to mull over the word ; then slapped his knee wid laughed until his mirth ended in a spasm of coughing . " A gangway pendulum ! A gangway pendulum , indeed ? And what happens with your gangway pendulum ? Perhaps youtenemiesmistake you for a clock , afloat on the ocean , and never beat to quarters until they are under your - tins ! "  | " It 's nothing to laugh about , " Marvin assured him , " unless you 're in the habit of laughing at something that will ptit money in your own pocket and at the same time damage England . " , " A gangway pendulum ! " Souville repeated , wiping the tears from his eyes . " And what do you expect me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm offering you the opportunity to benefit by it , " Marvinsaid . " Sell me two-thirds of your Renard and keep onethirdfor yourself , and you 'll have a prime investment . " Souville became instantly serious . " You have the money ? " " How much are you asking ? " " My Renard is a fortunate vessel , " Souville said slowly . " If I sold her , I would require a good price . If it were not that I am building another , I would not consider it at all  --  not at any price . For selling two-thirds of my Renard I would require "  --  he contemplated the ceiling of the barren cabin  --  " I would require one hundred thousand francs , gold . " Argandeau whistled , a faint , long-drawn-out whistle , while Newton , clasping his brow , murmured , " She must be sheathed with silver ! " Marvin studied the knuckles of his left hand , scarred from his battle with Little White . " That would be possible , if one-half could be paid at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half " " No , no , " Souville interrupted quickly . " I do nothing in that way ! I know nothing about you or your seamanship ! You pay me one hundred thousand francs in gold , and I gamble on you , because I am a friend of America and you are my brother in arms . "  | " But , " Marvin said patiently , " I am offering you my gangway pendulum " Souville expelled his breath explosively and waved 16% hand before his face as if freeing himself of cobwebs . " It is something fantastic , this pendulum ! I have heard of no such thing , ever , and to me it has no value 1 " " I think you make a mistake , " Argandeau protested . " My dear Marvin has said something to me of this pendulum ; and if he says it has a high value , then it has a high valtic . I tell you he has a flair for making strange discoveries . " Souville sighed . " No , it is something I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the morning passes and I must attend to the repairs on this small brig . " " One hundred thousand francs , " Marvin said , almost to himself , " seems to me somewhat high for two-thirds of an armed schooner . I 'll venture to say I could get a brig , and a good one , too , for a quarter of that sum . " " Of course , " Souville agreed , " but she would not be my Renard . " " No , " Marvin said , " but she 'd be as good as this captured brig of yours  --  better . Yes , sir ! I could buy a better brig than that captured brig for twenty thousand francs . " " It is possible , " Souville admitted politely , " but the twenty thousand francs would have to be in money , and not in conversation about a gangway pendulum ! And I think you will find that even though you have money , you will be obliged to pay at least twenty-five thousand francs . Cer. tainly I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five thousand . " " You will insist on twenty-five thousand ? " Marvin persisted.  |p217Souville  smiled . " Francs , you understand . Not pendu-Duns . " Marvin walked again to the stern windows and studied the vessel carefully . " It 's not a bad price , twenty-five thou sand francs , " he said . " Nof bad , if you sell her as she is . Shall you sell her as she stands , long guns and all ? " Souville nodded . Marvin drew his bench to the table , felt in an inner pocket and brought out a small heap of yellow coins . " You 've sold your brig for twenty-five thousand francs , " he said , " and I 've bought her , and here 's a little English gold to bind the bargain . I 'll put Newton and Steven aboard today to taki possession , and leave tonight with Argandeau to find the balance of the money . If you 'll make out a bill of sale , thesegentlemen can witness it . " Souville stared doubtfully at Marvin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for paper and quills . " You Americans ! " he said . " I think you are becrazed ! Can I be- j lieve it was this brig you desired from the first moment , and that you had no desire at all for my Renard ? " Marvin stopped in the counting of his gold pieces to look blankly into Souville 's face . " You 're laughing at me again ! " he said . " I 'm buying the brig only so you 'll feel obligatedto keep me informed of Slade 's movements . " With the eye farthest removed from Souville he winked , faintly at Newton ; while Souville , frowning , pocketed the gold pieces before him and went to driving his quill with thoughtful delicacy across a flimsy sheet of pale blue paper . When he had finished , Marvin took the paper from him and read it - carefully . Then he drew Newton to the stern windows of the Renard and pointed to the clumsy brig " She 's ballasted with rock , " he said . " Her center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry would n't make petticoats for my grandmother . Throw out the rock and ballast her with scrap iron . Her yards are stout enough for wharf piling . Sway ' em down and fine ' em out . Scrape ' em till they bleed . Then she 'll carry royals and skysails . Knock out the sheathing inside the bulwarks ; it 's no good except to make a splinter bucket out of her . Spend your money and spend it fast . " He picked up his hat and eyed Newton warningly . " Trust nothing to chance . Be careful . Keep an eye on everything and be sure everything is right . We may have to sail into hell after Mr. Slade , and I want this vessel fast enough to make the trip without scorching herself or anyone aboard . "  |p219MARVIN  , followed by Argandeau , came out from the avenue that tunneled through the forest of brown-leafed chestnuts , and stood staring across terraces and gardens to the gates of the Chateau of Valengay , and to the enormouspile of pallid stone beyond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cliff rising abruptly from a lee shore . They studied the two round towers at either end of the chateau 's long gray bulk  --  towers topped with shining rounded domes , so that there was a hint about them of gigantic warning lighthouses ; then , having studied them , they fell suddenly to brushing their garments and arranging their cravats in the shelter of the lofty boxwood hedge that stood between them and the gardens of the chateau . Argandeau sighed and shook his head . " It is possible that the thing may be accomplished , " he said , " but not unlessI tell them loudly that you are an American and thereforeinsane ! You must remember the French do not do things in this way ! They do not try to walk in to see a great man as if he were no more than a black cook in a forecastle ! No !

I tell you he ist a prince and a duke and a bishop , and nearly as great a man as Bonaparte himself . " " I 'm glad to hear it , " Marvin said . " He owes my father eleven dollars . " Argandeau examined Marvin carefully from heat to foot . " Eleven dollars , now that we have spent everything on your clothes , is a great deal , and I wish we had it ; but it is true that your clothes were worth the price . If you were older , with a red face and a puffy nose and a swollen stomach , you would look like a general or an admiral yourself , or a duke maybe . It is a pity you are not seeking help from a beautiful woman rather than from this great gentleman , who is able to talk anyone into thinking that black is white , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ y Spanish rabbit , she had a proverb about such an affair . There are some men , ' she said , who would not loan you fifty pesetas even though they were offered the Alhambra as security ; but almost any woman , provided she is over ten and under ninety-eight , will lend you all she possesses on no greater security than a mouthful of lies about love . ' " Marvin rubbed the dust from his boots with a wisp of grass , carefully brushed the tight dark-blue trousers th ; tt were strapped beneath them , ran his finger around the inside of the high stock that rose above his frilled shirt , and examined his snugly fitting , long-tailed coat for blemishes. , " Look here , " he told Argandeau . " Look at me carefully . Be sure there is nothing about me to prevent this great man from listening attentively to what I say . " He placed his cocked hat a little on the side of his head , thumped his gold-topped cane in the dust of the road , rested one hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p221Argandeau  walked slowly around him . " It is perfect , " he Insisted . " Perfect ! The seals of your watch , they look entirelyreal . There is nobody who would think the head of your cane was anything but gold . Also you carry this cane with an air , and the shoulders of your coat are narrow , so that you have a look of delicacy almost  --  nothing at all like a man who could put Little White under hatches in three rounds . " " Then try to find the door of this building and get me into it , " Marvin told him , " so I can forget my clothes and do what I 've come for . " He took off his hat , placed it , folded , under his arm , flourishedhis cane experimentally and glanced expectantly at Argandeau . Argandeau , however , seemed to have forgotten his existence ; for he was staring , with eyes as large and round as plums , at the boxwood hedge that bordered the avenue . Turning quickly , Marvin saw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face . In the very moment that he turned , an expression of annoyance crossed it , and it sank slowly from sight , leaving in his mind 's eye a picture of black hair piled in a high knot , a pointed chin and large blue eyes beneath black brows as curved and slender as a. bent hunting bow . From beyond the hedge there came the sound of softvoicedexpostulation , followed by rapid protestations in the voice of another woman . " Two rabbits ! " Argandeau murmured . " One held up the other to look over , but let her slip . " " Sir from America ! " called the soft voice from beyond he hedge . " It is the duke you Visit ? " Marvin cleared his throat . " Talleyrand , ma'am . "  | " Yes , " the soft voice continued . " You walk straight all through the great gates into the cour d ' honneur . Act , the court , on the right , is the Perron of the vestibule . Do 1144 go beneath the arch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , ma'am , " Marvin said . " I 've been afraid might not find him . " He took Argandeau by the arm and set off up the avenue toward the imposing bulk of carved gray stone . " Wait one moment ! " the soft voice called . Then , cloy to them , it added : " It may be you meet delay if you go to the vestibule . M. de Talleyrand is amused to see Americans , always ; but he is here not often ; and since you arrive on foot , the guards at the vestibule might neglect , you understand . The King of Spain , he is detained here , and so there are guards . Walk to the gates , therefore , and wait . 1 take you to another entrance , more quick . " " Thank you , ma'am , " Marvin said again . He move quickly to the opposite side of the avenue , drawing Argan. deau after him . Argandeau skipped a little , and blew a kiss toward the sky . " Two rabbits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proverb with my Spanish rabbit : Push Lucien Argandeau into a gutter and he will come out sweet with musk ! ' " " You fool ! " Marvin said . " You 'd want to talk about women if you were caught in the breakers and next door to death ! God knows what harm you 've done us with your gabble ! Get back to the inn and wait there for me ! " " But there are two of them ! " Argandeau protested . " While you are engaged with one , it may be that I can secure the cost of our lodgings from the other . Have you forgotten that we have not one sou in the world ? Not one Sou among the pair of us ? "  |p223His  protests , however , were vain ; for Marvin , his cane swinging jauntily and his cocked hat somewhat aslant , went briskly from him toward the distant gates without a backwardglance . The two women came through an opening in the boxwood hedge , chattering to each other as if they could never find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marvin it seemed they were little more than girls , pretending , with youthful coquetry , to have forgotten he was to wait for them at the gates . Yet there was nothing of coquetry in the glance the black-haired girl turned suddenly toward him- ; only inquiryand something of puzzlement . " The other , " she asked . " He does not wish to visit the duke also ? " Marvin shook his head . " He came to keep me company . He went back to the inn . " " Le Roi d'Espagne p " she asked . " You are remaining at Le Roi d'Espagne ? You will be uncomfortable , I think . " When he was silent , she turned from him and slipped her arm in that of her companion , saying over her shoulder : " You come with us , please . We take you to the tower , where the duke sits in the afternoon . " She chattered a little to her companion , a round , brown girl whose brown hair was piled in a knot even higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then to Marvin , as if to put him at his ease , she said : " How far have you come ? " " From Calais , " he told her . " From Calais since Tues-day . " " Then you have good horses , " she said , " but I fear you , break all your springs . " " No , ma'am . We came on foot . "  | The black-haired girl halted her companion and spoke rapidly to her ; then stared at Marvin . " What is this you say ? You walk from Calais to Valengay ? And since Tuesday ? Is it possible that a man can do this ? I think no horse could do it ! " " No , ma'am , " Marvin agreed , " but it was more importantfor me than it would be for any horse . " Again the black-haired girl spoke volubly to her companion , whereupon the two of them scrutinized Marvin as if in search of something about him that had hitherto escaped them . " It must be indeed important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct from America to this place ? " " No , ma'am . From England . " " From England ! But you are at war with Then I askyou , do you come direct to England from America ? " " No , ma'am . From China . " " From China ? I do not know where  --  ah , la Chine ! Ahhah ! Then it is important because you are diplomatique , ch e No ! That is not so ! If you were diplomatique , you would come here in a coach , and drive about this court with a great fracas , cracking the whip and blowing the horn and frighteningthe sparrows for two days ! You can not be diplomatique ! But still the matter is important ! Now I must think what it is so important as to bring a gentleman on foot from Calais to Valencay . Either it must be --  " She stoppedand eyed Marvin absently . At length , still silent , she drew her companion onward once more and , followed by Marvin , continued through the formal gardens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , round-topped tower in which the chateau ended . At the angle between the tower and the main wall of thisp225vast gray building there was a small door ; and at the door the round , brown girl turned away , running lightly toward the main entrance . The black-haired girl looked gravely at Marvin . " Now you go in to see M. de Talleyrand . Perhaps you like better to tell everything to me , so that I help you with him ? " " Thank you , ma'am , " Marvin said . " I would n't want to trouble you . " " But it is no trouble ! Come ; you tell me , and I shall see whether I have guessed correctly why your visit is important . Then I help you with the duke . " Marvin coughed . " I think , ma'am  --  no offense meant  --  that it would be better if I told Talleyrand himself . It 's he that must help me . " She smiled faintly . " You are cautious , and it is no great fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would make a difference , perhaps , if I say to you that I am a member of the duke 's household . It is possible you consider me a servant . " " No , no ! " Marvin said . " I can see you 're a great lady ! But a lady ca n't  --  ah , that is to say , if I ca n't convince the duke , how can a lady convince him for me ? " The black-haired girl opened her eyes wide . " How ? You do not seriously ask me how ! Surely you do not think there is any wise man but knows he can do better at anything at all by taking the advice of a woman ! Surely you know that any wise woman can persuade a man into doing whatever she desires ! " " That 's no doubt true , " Marvin admitted , " but it 's my belief that for every wise woman there are fifty foolish ones who consider themselves wise . "  | He shot a quick glance at her , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the fifty ? " she asked . " How can I tell , ma'am ? You know it 's important I should see Talleyrand , and still you keep me from him . Is that wisdom , ma'am ? " She shrugged , opened the door in the angle of the wall and preceded Marvin into a small vestibule , where she dropped her long brown cloak on a table . Marvin saw then that her yellow dress had next to no sleeves , and that , on one side , the skirt was slashed as high as the knee , almost as though a small staysail had been cut from it . She arranged her hair , looking up at him from beneath her elbow . " It may be , " she said , " that the King of Spain is with him also  --  the one who was stolen by " Slic wagged her head , frowned severely , thrust one hand into the front of her gown and the other behind her back , anil puffed out her cheeks , so that she had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , " she added sedately , " do not be disturbed by him . He is not much of a king . " She opened another door on the far side of the vestibule and went quickly into a circular chamber so large that for a moment it seemed to Marvin an empty blur of enormous pale carpets and gilded furniture heavily garnished with lions ' heads . Out of the blur came a vast hooded fireplace , and windows opening onto an ancient and heavy cloister . Near the fireplace was a table at which sat a man with a face like parchment , his chin propped so high by a thick collar that he had an air of disliking the odor of the place . Yet his features were so placid as to seem lifeless , and his eyes , peered out of the blank whiteness of his face like black paper pasted behind the eyeholes of a mask . In a reclining ,  |p227chair  on the opposite side of the fireplace lay a swarthy , sulky-seeming young man , rubbing a finger moodily over the strings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman at ( lie desk . " Uncle Maurice , " she said , " I have found this young man from America with something important to say to you : something so important that he can not tell it to any woman  --  only to M. de Talleyrand himself  --  so I think it must be the most important thing that ever was known . "  |p228ALLEYRAND  rose from his desk , smiling with an exquisite gentleness , but he did not move forward to greet his guest ; and Marvin noticed that one of the shoes the great man wore was misshapen , as if the foot within it were crippled The voice was rich and of a silken suavity : " From America ! I find this a great honor that a gentlemanfrom your fine young country should come here to Valencay to see me  --  a great honor , and a surprise as well . Sit , please , and tell me who has sent you , and how do you learn I am here ? It is almost never I come , and it is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape the turmoilof the Rue St. Florentin . " Marvin , uncomfortably erect in a small , hard chair , glanced from the smiling , mask-like face of Talleyrand to the black-haired girl , who had gone with the sulky man to stand beside a roulette wheel at a long window through which appeared the broad expanse of park , a dark belt of forest beyond , and , most distant of all , the little town of Valencay , its white roofs and Gothic church spire glistening in the afternoon sun . " Why , " he said , " nobody sent me . I came because  --  " He broke off and stared at the brilliant bindings of the books that encircled the room , and at the painted nymphs rioting on the ceiling . " It 's a mistake , of course ! We had a brig , the . Talleyrand , named for a Frenchman who came to Arundel and was taken by my father to buy land from General Knox ,  |p229years  ago . I thought it was you ; but surely it was never you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if to himself and almost as an afterthought , he added : " And owed my father eleven dollars . It 's not likely ! " Talleyrand lowered himself to a chair beside Marvin and looked intently into his eyes . " Eleven dollars ? " he asked politely . " I have no recollection of " He paused . " It istrue , certainly ; for no one would spuriously imagine thepeculiar sum of eleven dollars ; but it is strange that I -- Perhaps you remember your father telling the circumstances of those eleven dollars ? " " It was a wager , " Marvin said . " You wagered that a certain Cap Huff could eat no more than twenty-four ears of corn . He ate thirty-five , my father said , and so you lost eleven dollars . " Talleyrand nodded . " It is the truth ! I remember it ! After lie had eaten the corn , he wished your father to wager me that he could also eat two pies of squashes . It all comes back ! Dear me ! Dear me ! And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My father said it was because of the buttered rum , " Marvin said . " You went away early the next morning ; and my father said any man might be forgetful in the early morning , especially after being free with the buttered rum . He said , always , it was worth more to him to be able to say Talleyrand owed him eleven dollars than to says Talleyrand had paid him eleven dollars . " " It was wisely said , " Talleyrand agreed . " I hope your father is well ? He found excellent land for me  --  excellent land  --  and so it was possible for me to live , selling a little here and a little there . Yes , yes ; I remember ; fools and wiseP230men in America , they bought land at any price , anywhere 1 Tell me , your father is happy and successful ? " " He lost the Talleyrand , but now he owns another . Wliett . I go back , I shall take her out . " " You mean you will be captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that 's why I 've come here . " " But of course ! " Talleyrand exclaimed . " It is important that you return to America ! I understand your eagerness , and I tell you that it can be arranged easily . You may be perfectly sure it shall be done . " " That 's not it , " Marvin said . He cleared his throat . " There 's not time to go home . That is , the vessel I 'd have if I went to America is n't the kind I want , and I want one now . I can do twice the harm to England if I can take out a vessel from France . " " Twice the harm ? " Talleyrand asked . " I do not understand . If you sailed from America you would be more likely to discover unprotected British vessels , eh ? " " No , sir ! " Marvin said . " It 's in their home waters that they lack protection . You waste no time hunting ' em , for they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautious , you can surprise ' em where they least expect it . " " Now I see , " Talleyrand said . " What you desire is a fighting vessel ! You may depend upon it , I will assist you to this willingly . How much shall you wish to pay for this , vessel ? " " No , " Marvin said , " it 's not only a vessel . There 's another thing . " Embarrassed , he glanced at the black-haired girl , to find her staring thoughtfully at him over the shoulder of her sulky companion . " If I take out a private vessel from France , I 'll need a commission , and it must be got from the AmericanMinister  --  from Mr. Barlow in Paris . It 's not only top231get the vessel that I need your help , but to get the commissionas well . " Talleyrand smiled almost sleepily . " But my interference is unnecessary , sir . You are  --  how shall I say ?  --  you are perhapsovercareful in all this . Why do you not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him what you wish ? He is a gentleman and a poet , a trifle pompous and overcredulous , perhaps , but not at all a stickler for form .. You will find him sympathetic , I am sure . " Haltingly , and with a kind of desperation , Marvin attempted to explain : " I would n't have come here if I could have seen any other means of getting what I needed . I must have someone to vouch for me to Mr. Barlow . I have no papers  --  they were taken from me by the British . I thought you might --  " But even without papers , " Talleyrand interrupted , " there were other seamen from your ship who can vouch for you  --  other officers ? Were you the captain of the ship ? " " No , sir , " Marvin said . " No , sir . " " Then who was the captain and where is he ? " Talleyrandpersisted . " A lady was the captain . She thinks  --  she thought  --  it might be  --  that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Talleyrand and leaned against his shoulder . " It was what I suspected ! " she cried . " He had an air about him ! I said to myself , This important matter has a woman in it . " ' " Well , " Marvin said slowly , " I 'll try to explain . You see , if I should go alone to Mr. Barlow , he 'd ask about this lady , just as you have , and it might be he 'd have learned from her  --  or from someone with her  --  that I 'd been responsiblefor the loss of her ship to the British . Then he'd never issue a commission to me , and I could do nothing for her . " He hesitated ; then spoke haltingly : " You see  --  she 's prejudiced against me  --  I think she 's been told that 1  --  that I  --  well , I think she was made to hate me . " The black-haired girl sank to her knees beside Talleyrand'schair . " Oh , the lady hates him ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed to her your opinion% concerning the wisdom of women ? " Talleyrand dropped an admonitory finger on her shoulder . " Of course , " he told her , " you know everything about this affair , after hearing a few words ; but I am older and duller , and there are still a few things obscured from me . " To Marvin he added , " Now you begin , so that we may kno , , v about this lady you love , but who loves another gentleman who has been prejudicing her against you . " " That 's not so ! " Marvin protested . " That 's not what I said , and it could n't be true ! She 's hasty in her judgments , but she could n't  --  she 'd never " " Tell from the beginning , " the black-haired girl insisted , leaning comfortably against Talleyrand 's knee . Before Marvin had finished his tale , the swarthy , sulkylookingSpanish king had ceased to turn his roulette wheel and had gone gloomily from the room , evoking doleful sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light the , tall candles around the walls . When Marvin had finished , Talleyrand fingered his high stock and stared at the ceiling with expressionless black eyes . " It is all quite plain , " he said . " Not only must I intercedefor you with Mr. Barlow , but if I do what you wish , I , must purchase this vessel and intrust it to an untried captain , and all with no certainty for me of receiving any re/turn whatever . Does this seem to you fair ? To me it has the air of placing money carefully "  --  he dropped an imaginary atom from his finger tips  --  " in the ocean . " Marvin sat forward , balanced on the extreme edge of his chair . " No , " he said . " You ca n't lose  --  not unless they sink my ship and kill me ! If we have no luck , I 'll pay it back after the war , with interest . But we 'll  --  I can feel luck when it 's close ; every seaman that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have my pendulum ! You 'll have the use of my pendulum ! They 'll never catch me while I have my pendulum ! You 'll have your money back ten times over ! " Talleyrand waved a white hand languidly . " It means nothing to me , this pendulum . You have thought about it ; it exists only in your brain , eh ? It seems to me a simple thing ; so simple that our great seamen would have discovered it before now if it had value . " " Yes , it seems so , " Marvin admitted , " but they have n't . Not even Nelson ! Nelson said guns at sea are n't any good except at point-blank range , when they ca n't miss . lie was wrong ; but he 's right , too , as long as guns are fired by guesswork , as they are now . Why , at long range , both the French and the English , all of ' em , fire with the roll of the vessel  --  as she rolls downward or as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucky enough to get home . A hit at long range is an accident today , unless a gun is handled by an expert rifleman ; yes , and at long range there is n't one gun crew out of a thousand that could hit a mark the size of this chateau ! With my pendulum there 'll be no guessing about it . Every time I fire a long gun , I 'll fire from an even keel , and I could hull this room four times out of five at half-mile range . " To Marvin it seemed that Talleyrand and his black-hairedp234niece eyed him with as much of disfavor as disbelief . " 1 do n't mean to brag , " he told them mildly . " I 've always looked for easier ways to do things , and almost al%vayo there 's an easier way . It appears to me most people make things as hard for themselves as they can . " " Yes , I think it is so , " Talleyrand said , " and I am inter  --  ested in a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how you are confident . You speak of England 's great fleet as if it were nothing at all ! It has destroyed our navy utterly  --  our fine , powerful navy  --  and yet it seems to be in your mind that a few men with a few small fishing boats can strike a blow at England that will be felt . " " And so they can , " Marvin said . " So they can , provided their seamanship is what it should be . All that 's necessary is to keep out of range of heavy war craft and sink the slow and clumsy merchantmen . " " Of course , " Talleyrand admitted , " nothing else is necessary , provided , as you say , their seamanship is superior . When I was in America , I studied the inhabitants of your fishing cantons , and it was clearly to be seen that your fisher  --  men are not to be compared with those of Europe , and that fishing in America is not a means of forming sailors alid , turning out strong and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except in the case of the whalers of Nantucket . " " But we do n't use fishermen on our merchantmen , " Mar , vin protested . " We use seamen . " " But your seamen are fishermen first , " Talleyrand said placidly . " I have been in your fishing cantons and written papers on the subject for our National Institute . " Marvin gripped his clenched hands between his knees . " Well , " he said slowly , " we have many fishermen . We also have many merchantmen , and we 've been forced to sail dif/ferently from the English merchantmen . They heave-to at night , most of them  --  send down their royal and topgallant yards and masts , even  --  whereas we crack on . Their ships are half manned with landsmen , because the navy steals their crews . We 've had to be better seamen than the English , and so we are . You may depend upon what I tell you ! If you help me with this vessel , you 'll never lose by it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case I 'm killed . I 'll do any-thing  --  anything Talleyrand , assisted by his black-haired niece , rose to his feet and stared with a faint , blank smile at the top of Marvin'shead . " But of course I will help you ! " he said . " Of course ! Now I must think ! " Again he scrutinized the ceiling on which half-clad nymphs cheerfully encouraged the advancesof a disreputable satyr . " When is it you wish this vessel ? " " At once , " Marvin said eagerly . " If I ca n't get to sea in two weeks , it might be  --  I might not be able --  " " Now let me see , " Talleyrand interrupted . " I think it is best to do thus : Go now to your inn , and you will have word from me about this . " The black-haired girl turned from him and went to stand by the window once more , idly turning the roulette wheel . " Yes , " Talleyrand continued , " that will be best . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you could give me letters  --  to Mr. Barlow  --  to your bankers  --  I 'd walk night and day to get to Paris with them . " Talleyrand 's smile became indulgent . " No , no ! " he said . " Nothing would be gained . The best thing is to wait patientlyat your inn , and soon you will hear from me . " He shook Marvin 's hand warmly and limped with him to the door . " To have the pleasure of this visit is like a breath from America . Soon  --  very soon  --  we shall have the pleasure again , eh ? " The outer door opened and closed , and Marvin found himself standing in the angle of the towering wall . When , a little later , he entered the main room of the Roi d'Espagne , Argandeau bounced upward from the table where he sat over a brandy bottle with the inn 's proprietress , a large woman with a black mustache . " You have got it ! " Argandeau exclaimed , looking into Marvin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . He has promised everything . " " And it was all promises ? " Argandeau persisted . " Surely he gave you the eleven dollars he owed your father ! " Marvin shook his head . " Promises ! " Argandeau exclaimed . " But I know these promises ! Now it will be necessary for one of us to go back to see those two pretty rabbits that were behind the hedge . " P237THE note that came to Marvin on the following afternoon was brought by a serving man in a green livery , and at the sight of the man and the letter he bore , Argandeau sighed softly . " Thanks to God ! " he murmured . " The woman who owns this inn has been feeding us for love of me , but when she sees you have a letter at last , it may be she will be content to continue trusting us because of our prospects . " But the note contained no news of anything so definite as prospects ; it did , however , cause Marvin to return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( come out from the avenue of chestnuts to find themselves confronted by the long gray walls and the squat round towers of Valencay . As on the preceding day , he stood staring at the enormousmass of masonry and seemed to listen ; then , apparentlyhearing nothing , he turned from the avenue , entered the edge of the chestnut forest and emerged on the leafcoveredgrass of the chateau gardens . Even before he had left the shelter of the chestnuts he caught sight of her , swathed in a long gray cloak and sitting on a stone bench against the boxwood hedge ; and it seemed to him , as he went toward her , that she eyed him with more indulgence than pleasure . She nodded so that her black curls bobbed when he stood before her . " So you come back , " she said , and to Marvin her eyes looked as round and guileless as those of a little child . " It must be you are no longer afraid you may 1N helped ! " She gave him her hand ; and Marvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coughed . There seemed to be something of the schoolmistress about her as she wrapped herself more snugly in her gray cloak . " In America you do not kiss the hand of a lady ? " " Well , " he said apologetically , " it is not  --  there are tines  --  I mean , if we thought She drew her hand from beneath her cloak , stared at it critically and again extended it to Marvin ; yet , when he hat ) taken it and bent over it , she drew it away from him as suddenly as she had brought it from under her wrap . " I must tell you at once , " she said . " My uncle has changed his mind . It is impossible that he help you . " " Impossible ! " Marvin exclaimed . " What do you mean ? He said he 'd help me ! He promised to help me ! " She shrugged her shoulders . " There are things you do not understand . " He turned slowly to look at the thick tower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , that must be true , " he admitted . " I do not understand how any man can make a promise and then break it for no cause . " He rapped with his cane on the gravel walk . " I must see him again ! He can not break his promise like this ! " " It is no use , " the black-haired girl told him . " In one little hour he departs for Paris , and it is quite , quite impossible that he should see you now . " " But there is no one else I can go to ! " Marvin cried . " No one ! There 's no one in France who would lend me the money , except this man my father helped . If I could see him for five minutes "  | " But I tell you there are things you do not understand ! " she insisted . Marvin laughed . " I understand that I 've lost two days through the promises he never intended to keep . " " Now you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and Marvin sat beside her , dropping his hat and stick 311 the gravel walk . " You do not understand Frenchmen , you Americans , any more than you understand women . My uncle , M. de Talleyrand , he would have helped you , yes , and gladly , if it had not interfered with his ideas of right and wrong . " " Then why did he promise ? " Marvin said harshly . " Does he manufacture new ideas of right and wrong each day ? " She bent forward to look into his face , shaking her black curls so that a faint , penetrating fragrance rose from them . " Are there no promises broken in America ? " she asked . " Here it is the custom ; for if our great men said No ' to , everyone 's demands , they would have poniards in the backs , all of them , in one day 's time , and a great man with a poniard in his back is no better than a dead carp in the moat . So they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had been a statesman you would know the truth of this . Maybe you do not have statesmen in America . " Marvin shook his head . " This is talk that means nothing , like your uncle 's talk about American seamen . A broken promise is a broken promise , and nothing can change that . As for his ideas of right and wrong , they 're probably no better than the papers he wrote for your National Institute on the fishing cantons of America . Fishing cantons ! Good God ! " She came closer to him , so that Marvin felt the warmth of her shoulder through the sleeve of his coat . " No , no , no ! "  |p240she  said . " It is only that you do not understand , you Americans ! Listen now , and I explain everything to you . My uncle , he loves France , but he does not love this small butcher "  --  she pretended to glower , thrusting her fingers into the front of her cloak and inflating her cheeks so that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose desire for power is hurrying France and all of us into one large grave ! " She seemed to shiver , so that Marvin took her hand and held it in both of his . " One month ago , " she continued , smiling up at him , " this madman buried himself and his army in the depths of Russia  --  in Russia , and with winter moaning at his shoulder l Only this week we have had the news . He has burned Moscow ! He has destroyed his shelter and his provisions , and the Russians are on every side of him : millions of them ! I le is audacious and imprudent and a madman ; so it is inevitablethat he and his army must sink , either beneath the numbers of his enemies , or beneath hunger , or beneath the snow . Already they are as good as buried . It is the beginning of the end . That is why Maurice has come to his chateau  --  to tell the Spanish king , who was stolen out of Spain and imprisoned here by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own country . Now you are able to understand it , eh ? If my uncle helps you to go out on the ocean with a device that will be bad for England , then England might be longer in chopping off the madman 's head and restoringpeace to France . " " It 's what I suspected ! " Marvin said . " It 's an explanationthat does n't explain . He 'll help his brave allies , the Americans , if it suits his plans ; and I 'm his friend , unless it 's inconvenient for him ! " " No , " she assured him , " it is only that we , you and I. doCAPTAIN CAUTION 241P241not have great minds , like my Uncle Maurice . He is French , and the French people have ideas . You are materialist , thinking of the cost of your ship , but Maurice thinks above such things . He thinks of nations , moving against one anotherlike a game of chess , and what is best to be done in each small move , you comprehend ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must ! You speak of friendship ! Do you think friends are common as herring ? They are not ! For poor people , perhaps , they are no more scarce than blue diamonds ; but for the rich and powerful they are as rare as unicorns ! My Uncle Maurice has discovered that there is no man he - an trust . Through one man he lost two million in the stock market ; through another he lost his beautiful home , the Hotel Monaco . Even by Bonaparte , for whom he had done everything , he was called a thief  --  a man without faith or lionor ! By Bonaparte ! " " It seems impossible ! " Marvin said gravely . " But it is true ! " she insisted . " It was while that madman , fought in Spain . His brother Lucien returned to France with millions and millions he had taken from the Spaniards , and Bonaparte said he had acted wisely . But when my Uncle Maurice returned with only two little millions , this madman called him names , worse than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no man he can trust ! From one woman , two women , perhaps , he can have sympathy and friendship . From a man , no ! It is the same with me . I can not trust any woman . I take pleasure in the company of some , certainly ; but all of them  --  all !  --  they will say any bad thing about me behind my back , whenever it pleases them ! If I want friends , I must find them among men  --  Maurice and my husband and perhapsone more , or two . "   " Your husband ! " he exclaimed . She twisted quickly on the bench , drawing her hand away ; then leaned backward to smile up at the expression on his face . " You see , I have told you there are many things pm do not understand ! When you are older , and have sail ( -4 ' your ship to many ports , you will no longer be like a little boy . Then , it may be , I would no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for assistance from my Uncle Maurice . " She leaned toward him again ; and again from her small pyramid of black curls there rose that faint and penetrating fragrance . " You see , I am telling you secrets . When you are in need of a lady 's help you must appear helpless and far from home , and a little frightened , especially of her . 7'lien she will feel at once that she must protect you , and see flirt you are made happy . " Marvin stared helplessly at her for a moment ; then stooped for his hat and stick and rose to his feet . " I 'll try to do better another time , ma'am . " " But you are obstinate ! " she cried . " Never have I seen s man so obstinate ! Can nothing make you believe that some . where there is a woman wise enough to help you ? " " Why , " he said , " I 'm beyond help , if you 've told me the truth . Your uncle wo n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there ? " She jumped from the bench and stamped her foot an inch from his own . " So you will walk back to Paris , becauseof your pride , penniless and helpless , and able to do nothing against your enemy , or for the lady he is stealing out from under your nose ! Nothing , do you understand ? Nothing ! This Mr. Barlow , the American Envoy of whom you speak , he is not in Paris . He is not in France , even . I leP243has been summoned to Vilna by the madman , and has gone to him . Like all the others , he has plunged himself into Russia and into his grave at a word from Bonaparte . " Marvin stared at his hand , clenching and unclenching it as though he found it painful . " Did you know yesterday that Mr. Barlow was not in France ? " he asked . She nodded . " Of course . And I knew more . I knew that a gentleman has recently come to Paris to act in place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And so , " Marvin said thoughtfully , " you let me go on thinking that Mr. Barlow was in Paris ! " She shrugged her shoulders . " It was not I who let you go on thinking . It was Maurice , who had his own reasons . Diplomats , you understand , consider it unwise to speak the truth or tell what they know . And who am I to disabuse you about anything , knowing that you believe there are fifty foolish women for every wise one ? " Marvin stared at her helplessly . " You know who it is that took Mr. Barlow 's place ? Who is it ? " She hesitated , her eyes on his face : then seemed to reach a sudden decision . " The gentleman 's name is Barnet . He was the consul of your country in Havre . I myself know this gentleman . If I ask something of Mr. Barnet , he cannotrefuse me . " She came close to him and placed her hand on his shoulder . " But of course you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He shook his head . " No : not all of you . If ever I had such thoughts about you , I made a mistake . " " All ! " she said . " A triumph ! The gentleman pays me a pretty compliment by saying he made a mistake ! What , then , will the gentleman do ? "   " Do ? " he asked . " Do ? I do n't know what I 'll do . I do n't know . I 'll try to think of something to do . " She made a sound of exasperation . " Almost I am tempted to do nothing for you , after all ! If you need help so much , why is it you do not ask me for it ? " " It 's not only a letter to Mr. Barnet that I need , " Marvin said . " I 've got to have money , and a deal of it . I 'd mishke asking a lady for money , even if she could give it to me , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would n't seem  --  it would n't seem wise ! " " But I am not going to give it to you ! First you mint make it possible for me to get enough to lend you , and then you must repay my loan as you said you would repay my uncle  --  twice over  --  three times over ! " He was silent , studying her . She laughed lightly . " You see , now , I am wiser than you have thought . You have thought , all this time , that I ant impatient to give you what you need ; but now you find you do not know , even , how you shall help me get it ! " " How I can help you get it , " Marvin said slowly , " I have no idea , but you shall have a paper guaranteeing you 300 per cent profit on your venture  --  and I shall assume that you 're as impatient for money as I am for a ship . " She sat on the bench again and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You are a nice young man  --  so nice that it would be easy to forget that one must be careful always about matters of business . Yesterday you told us of a pendulum . Of course , I know nothing of pendulums ; ) tit there was once an English gentleman who came here to see my uncle , and he spoke of your M. Benjamin Franklin , calling him one of those damned Yankees who could do anything . " Her eyes twinkled . " It may be that he was right , P245and that there is something about Yankees that enables them to do more than other peoples . It might be that your pendulumis something new and wonderful . It might be , even , that you could invent other things if the need arose  --  that you could invent a safe manner of playing roulette . The thought came to me yesterday when I stood by the window and spun the wheel . " She raised her eyebrows and sighed . " Here am I , obliged to play at roulette with my friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount I owe is greater and greater . " In spite of the little smile that curled one corner of her lips , it seemed to Marvin that she was more than half serious in what she said . And after all , he thought , he was one of those damned Yankees . He pondered on the structure of the gambling wheels he had seen aboard the prison ship . " I know little about gambling , ma'am , " he said at last , reluctantly . " The Frenchmenon the hulks , they seemed to think a system does no good . That 's what you 're asking me to invent , is n't it ? A system at which you can win ? If that 's it , ma'am , I 'd better not waste my time or yours ; for by the time you 've won what I must have , the need for it will be over . " Again she jumped from the bench to place her hand on his arm . " But I seek only a method to keep me from losing ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier way to do things ; so , if that is true , it is only necessary for you to play roulette a little , in order to find an easier way for me to play it . Then I shall quickly save enough for your ship , and I can give it to you even before I save it ! " " Play roulette a little ! " Marvin exclaimed . " There are reasons why I could n't play roulette , even though it was played with buttons ! "   " I know , " she added hurriedly . She drew an envelope from the front of her gown . " It is here ! What Maurice owed your father , with the interest for all these years , and a little more , too , since you are doing this for me . " At the look in his face , she flirted her fingers airily . " lint it is nothing to twist the nose over ! Nothing ! Maurice , lie had intended to return this to you , you understand , but affairs were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , it w :  --  his money . " She eyed him . " I truly think it was a part of the very money that he brought home from Spain , as one brie a home dust on his shoes without knowing how or where it was acquired . And it is a favor for me that you are doing with it  --  a favor ! You must take it and go quickly back to Paris . There you will visit No. 9 in the Palais Royal . There are many gambling apartments in the Palais Royal , hilt No. 9 is the fashionable address . At No. 9 you study the wheel , morning , noon and night , and then you make me a little system , eh ? You make me a little system , and I will come there soon  --  soon . If the system has merit , you shall have what you need from me . " She pressed the envelope into Marvin 's hand , nodding : it him as at an obedient child . Then her little smile seemed tai harden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But do n't forget  --  the money I lend you in Paris for a ship  --  that 's , business . Three hundred per cent . " She laughed and added : " It 's the kind of business I like ; a chance to get three for one , and the three to conic suddenly ! And what would you ? It 's the spirit of the tines  --  everybody playing with gold and golden bubbles  --  and I 'm a woman of the times . My husband lost sixty thousand livres last week on the advice of a ballet girl . I would like toP247show him how business should be done with a reliable Yankee gentleman . " She glanced suddenly at the watch that hung from her neck . " Heaven ! It is already one hour , and I must depart with Maurice ! " She reached up , drew down Marvin 's head and kissed him abruptly ; then ran lightly toward the chateau . P248THE turmoil that filled the high-ceiled rooms on the second ) floor of No. g in the low , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Marvin , who sat at : iii end of one of the four crowded roulette tables . On one side of him was an aged harridan , her head swathed in a green turban from which rose a single ostrich feather ; her checks were a hectic pink and her bared shoulders protrudcd angularly from a gown of a sickly yellow . On the other side was a girl as young as she was scantily clad ; and the two of them stared frequently and invitingly at Marvin and the pile of colored plaques that he shielded beneath his big handy . Close behind his seat stood Argandeau , resplendent in a long-tailed coat of delicate gray and trousers of a pale but brilliant blue ; and the two of them whispered together , regardless of the crowd that surged around the tables -- a crowd of officers , fops and women whose dresses , slit to the knee and even to the thigh , seemed about to , and sometime indeed did , slip from the shoulders that held them precariouslysuspended  --  a crowd that screamed and chattered so shrilly as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roulette balls and the croupier 's monotonous : " Malec your plays , gentlemen and ladies . Rien ne va plus . " " There it is ! " Argandeau whispered . " Thirty-three ! Four times this croupier has rolled it into the last dozen . He is ina groove ! I say put it on the last eighteen , before he -W escape from the groove ! "   " The last eighteen , " Marvin agreed , " but if we lose , we way be here the rest of the afternoon and all night as well ! " 1 le pushed twenty-five white plaques to a near-by section of the diagrammed table , rested his chin on his hand and stared up at the cluster of hanging lamps that burned dimly in the hot and smoky air . The ball whirred in the wheel , slowed , Dumped against the nubbins , tripped on a slot and freed itself ; then darted to its final resting place like a frightened mouse . " Nineteen , red , uneven , last half , " droned the croupier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rake and knocked down Marvin 's pile , counted it quickly and deftly pushed him an equal number of white counters . " There is another finished , " Argandeau said gently . " The fourteenth this afternoon ! It is a good time to start another , eli ? He is getting away from that last dozen , and soon I think he will roll it into the first eighteen . " Marvin , his hands cupped around his pile of plaques , rose in his place and looked uneasily behind him . At Argandeau'selbow he saw a small pyramid of black curls and a pair of blue eyes that stared innocently into his . She nodded to him . " I am here , you see . " Marvin divided his earnings and handed a part of them to Argandeau . " Play carefully , " he warned him . " What you win will go into your pocket , but what you lose must come out of it , also . " With that he relinquished his seat and joined the blackhairedgirl , who slipped her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booths that lined the passageway between the roulette hall and the refreshment room . When the curtain of the inclosure she selected had dropped behind them , she made a pretense of fixing her curls and , as she did so , looked up at him from under her elbow . " Now you are a little boy again  --  a sulky little boy . ( tint it is not my fault . I came here as quickly as I could ; not one moment sooner could I come ! " " You have no business here at all , " Marvin said . " I bclieveevery bad woman in Paris must come to this build-ing . " She raised her eyebrows . " I do not know how to distinguishthe good from the bad , and it would be interesting if you would tell me . It is the fashion to come here . You will see Madame de StaO here , and Madame de Senlis , as well as many of the laundresses , butchers ' wives and cool , ' daughters that Bonaparte has honored with titles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play ; and some of them , I think , are quite , quite good , though I ani not sure what you mean by good . ' You are doomed to be in unhappy young man if you think that no woman is a good woman unless she has made no mistakes and had no desires , ever ; and in case you wish that sort of good woman , you must be careful to marry a plaster saint out of a church . " " Well , " Marvin said uncertainly , " well She dismissed the matter with a movement of her shoulder . " You tell me now about our system . I have seen enough to know that you have discovered one . " Marvin drew up a chair to the booth 's table and fumbled in his pocket . " I 'm sure of one thing , " he said , " and that is there 's no system at all by which you or anyone else can be sure of winning . " He brought out a thin packet of bank notes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while . I 've won enough to buy food and get new clothes for Argandeau ; so ' here 's the money you loaned me , over and above my father'sP 251eleven dollars , plus 6 per cent interest for nineteen years . " " Pouf for your 6 per cent and your nineteen years ! " she cried . " Tell me how it was done ! " " Why , " he said , " it 's simple enough . Any child must quickly learn that his money will vanish like smoke at roulette , unless he plays the even chances  --  the black or the red , the odd or the even , the first eighteen numbers or the last eighteen . To stake your money on a single number is like throwing it in the fire . " " Sometimes it is possible to win on a single number , " she said . " It is exciting , that ! " Marvin only laughed . " To win by the even chances is too slow ! " she objected , then . " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work ; and you must be tireless , and keen in your judgment . " " You make it seem like a business rather than a game . " " So it is ! So is everything else , if you want to win . I 've been told there are some countries , even , where people make almost a business of love . " " Very well , " she said impatiently . " We play on the even chances . What then ? " " Well , " Marvin said , " when I studied the game I found that people met disaster most frequently from overreaching themselves . They 'd become impatient , after many small winnings ; so they 'd bet largely and lose everything in two turns of the wheel . Therefore , it was necessary to find a method to prevent that  --  a method that would aim to win a small amount of money in a short time , and to begin again wheneverthe small amount had been won . " He set down some marks on a sheet of paper and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For1 convenience , " he said , " we 'll say we 're playing with plague* of one franc each . " On the paper were five upright mark% , close together . " Each of these marks , " Marvin continued , " represents one franc . It might easily represent five francs , or ten , or a hundred , but we 'll call it one franc . Suppose , now , that you start to play , having in mind that you wish to win five francs , and that when five francs have been won , you must start from the beginning to win another five . You have a line of figures  --  five ones  --  five one-franc marks . You must play , always , the figures at each end or the line . That is , you play a one and a one  --  two francs - and you play them , say , on the red . If you win , you recci%-e two francs from the croupier , and you cross off the two end figures . That leaves three ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both ones . If you win , you receive two more francs and cross off the end figures . That leaves a single figure , which you play  --  one franc on an even chance . If you win , you cross off the last number and receive one fanc . Then you 've won five units  --  in this case , francs . If each unit had been ten francs , you 'd have won fifty . So your ventureis finished ; your numbers are entirely crossed out . Therefore you set down five more ones and start over again . " She tossed her head . " And if I lose , I double , eh ? That is no system ! " Marvin ignored her words . " Again you commend : by playing the end numbers  --  two ones . You lose . This time you can not cross out a figure ; instead you must add the Figure 2 to your row of ones  --  a number greater by one than the last number . Then you play the two end numbers  --  a , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you add the Figure 3 and again play the ends  --  a one and a three . 1 fP253again you lose , you add a four , and play a one and a four . This time you may win ; if you do , you cross off the one and the four , and play the end figures of those that remain  --  a one and a three . If you again win , cross off the one and the three , and play a one and a two ; but if you should lose , add a figure larger by one than the last number not crossed off . When finally the numbers are entirely crossed out you 'll again have won five units  --  five francs  --  so once more you write down your five ones for a new venture . " " Why , " she said slowly , " I think there may be something in it . It seems simple , also . " Her arm , resting on his shoulder , slipped around his neck , and with the impulsiveness of a child she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's simple , " Marvin admitted , " but there 's danger in it , none the less , as there is in almost everything that 's exciting . " She withdrew her arm and stood a little away from him , arranging her hair and glancing at him from beneath her elbow . " The danger , " Marvin continued , " will come when you 've lost repeatedly . There may come a time , then , when you 're setting down larger and larger figures with each loss , and must stake thirty or forty or fifty francs on each play , again and again , in order to win only five francs eventually . It 's not likely to happen often , but when it happens , I advise you to go cautiously  --  to stop playing entirely when your wagers , on a single game , have become as large as your previous day 's winnings . " " Pouf ! " she cried gayly . " Go cautiously , indeed ! Come , we shall play your system and I shall show you there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arm and tugged at him .   Marvin rose slowly . " Then you think you can win with this system ? " " But of course ! You have won and I shall win ! " She swayed against him , her blue eyes laughing up into his and her red lips a little parted . Marvin put his arm about her . " Then you 're satisfied with what I 've done ? " He lifted her and kissed her , kissed her a second time , and in the small and tawdry booth there was a moment of breathless silence . At length she laughed softly . " We play now . " " It 's what you wanted ? " he persisted . " What you expected ? " " Yes , it is something new , and so easy that I can not understand why nobody has discovered it before . " " Then there 's still time today for you to go with me to sec Mr. Barnet at the Legation ; and with good luck I can be in Calais tomorrow . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Today you remain with me ; tomorrow will be time enough to see this ambassadorof yours . " Marvin shook his head . " There 's my brig to be got ready . I 've waited and waited until I 'm near bursting from doing nothing . There were two American privateer captains in here yesterday , but today they 've gone to Lorient , and tomorrowthey 're putting to sea . How do you think I felt , sitting here and elbowing all the  --  all the  --  well , sitting here in Paris when they were starting out to comb the Channel for British ships ? " " British ships ! " she exclaimed . " I think there is something in your mind besides British ships . " He nodded . " There 's the loan you 're making me , and the ' Soo per cent profit I 've promised to pay you or . it . I 've gotP255that to think about , and other things as well . " Seemingly as an afterthought , he added , " The sooner I get to sea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And the sooner you get to sea , the sooner you 'll catch up with the lady who left you for another man , eh ? " Marvin took her hands in his . " A lady who has a husband of her own , and an uncle as affectionate as one I could mention , should never bother her pretty head about a lady I have n't seen for many a long week and may never see again . " He kissed her almost roughly , threw back the curtainof the booth and drew her after him into the crowd that surged and gabbled between the roulette tables . On his way to the door , he tapped Argandeau on the shoulder and motioned to him to follow . Argandeau clasped his forehead in despair . " It is against me ! " he whispered hoarsely . " I am playing forty-two francs at one throw , and these buzzards have one hundred and thirty-seven francs of my money ! " " Leave it and be ready to start for Calais , " Marvin told ' , aim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow ! " P255The outer room of the Legation of the United States of America was a small and dingy cubicle , presided over by a contemptuous lady with green eyes and hair the color of untended brass ; and it seemed to Marvin , standing humbly before her with the black-haired girl beside him , that slic was filled with the need of supplying the grandeur that tier surroundings lacked , and of upholding , by means of haughtiness and pride , the dignity of the country that she thought she represented . " Mr. Barnet is engaged , " she told Marvin disdainfully . " You can sit down and wait "  --  she nodded her head toward an inner room  --  " but you should have come earlier . I think it 's too late for him to see anyone else . " " But I must see him today , " Marvin protested . " If you 'll tell him it 's important " The contemptuous lady eyed him coldly . " Leave your card , and it 's possible you can see the secretary . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I seem to recall , " she said to the contemptuous lady , " that Mr. Barnet was brought here from Havre in order to act and to think on behalf of Mr. Barlow , who has gone to Russia . Perhaps I am mistaken . " The voice of the contemptuous lady was hard . " No , you 're not mistaken . " " In that case , " the black-haired girl said softly , " it will be interesting to the Minister of Foreign Affairs to learnP257that there is yet another who is thinking and acting on behalf of Mr. Barlow . He will be pained , I have no doubt , to know that the thinking for your great country is done in a room "  --  she touched a finger tip to the windowpane that overlooked the flickering street lights of the Rue St. Honore  - -  -  " where the outlook is so obscured . " " Obscured ! " the green-eyed lady cried indignantly . " Obscured ! I 'll have you know that window was washed last week , ma'am ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " you can doubtlesssee the advisability of going at once to Mr. Barnet , regardlessof who is with him , and telling him that Comtesse Edmond de Perigord , Duchesse de Courland , must see him at once . At once , you understand ! " The green-eyed lady stared at her unbelievingly ; then rose suddenly to her feet and hurried from the room . As for the black-haired girl , she made adjustments in the curls under her bonnet of yellow silk , glancing quickly at Marvin beneathher elbow as she did so  --  a way she had , and not an unpleasant one either , he thought . " You see , " she said , " how often it is that even a woman may help a man . " The green-eyed lady returned breathless . " Please come in ! " she gasped . " I would n't have  --  I did n't know --  " The black-haired girl stopped her with a gesture . " It is forgotten ; but hereafter , for the sake of your countrymen , for whom I have great sympathy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat clearer . " The three of them passed through a large waiting room in which sat a strange figure of a woman  --  an angular , broad-shouldered woman who seemed to have no feet or legs , and whose face , bent over huge knitting needles that clacked and Glittered , was screened from them by an enor/mous white headgear so constructed that sharp white wings protruded beyond her broad shoulders and shook with the violence of her knitting . Before her , on the floor , rested two empty boat-shaped shoes of felt , each shoe large enougli to hold a healthy infant . At the sound of footsteps she looked up . Her face was long and brown ; her eyebrows as busby as newborn black ducklings ; and from under them her beady eyes stared with a suspicion made more piercing by thr sudden silence of her knitting needles . Madame de Perigord tapped Marvin 's arm . " See theve ! " she said . " A wounded grenadier , no doubt ! It would be like this little butcher of ours "  --  she made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw against the guns ! " The angular woman rocked mightily in her chair , an ( I from under her black skirt two ham-like feet , covered witli wrinkled white stockings , thumped to the floor and groped for the felt shoes . Marvin and his companion left her groping , and entered a smaller anteroom , the anteroom of the Minister 's office . The door into the office was open ; and in the doorway , looking up into the face of a tall gray-haired man who was bidding her farewell , stood a bonneted girl whose dress of gray satin clung with unwrinkled smoothness to her flat back and slender figure . She turned , and as her eyes fell on Marvin , she seemed for a moment to flame into sudden radi-  --  ance . Her eyes , deep in the shadow of her bonnet 's brim , held sparks of light . " Why , Dan ! " she exclaimed . " You 're  --  I 'm " The tall man smiled . " You know this lady ? You 're just in time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell . her , to ' take out a letter-of-marque at such a time . " P259Marvin breathed heavily , as if incapable of thought or motion . " A letter-of-marque ? " he mumbled . " A letter-of -- marque ? " Corunna Dorman glanced from Marvin to the blackhairedgirl and back to Marvin again ; and her face grew blank . " Why , yes , " she said , " a letter-of-marque . " She smiled gravely at the tall American beside her , bowed slightly to Marvin , and made as though to pass . " Wait ! " Marvin said . " A letter-of-marque . That means you 're getting a ship for " He stopped , seeming to swallowthe word he had meant to speak . " It means , " Corunna said , " that Captain Slade helped the when I was deserted by everyone else . " " Slade , " Marvin said thickly . " Slade . " " Captain Slade , " Corunna said gently , " has been the soul Df energy and generosity . " Marvin looked at her and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black-haired girl said suddenly . " I must not keep Mr. Barnet waiting . " She smiled sweetly at Marvin . " When you have finished talking with this lady , you must join us quickly if you are to have your commission today . " She went to Barnet and gave him her hand ; then , as she passed through the doorway , she added over her shoulder , " Do not be long  --  Dan ! " " Wait ! " Marvin said . " Wait ! " But Barnet , bewildered , followed the black-haired girl into his office and closed the door behind him . " So you 're to have a commission ! " Corunna said . " How strange ! Are you getting one from America because the English would n't give you one ? " Marvin stared at her . " The English ? What do you ' mean ? " P26o Corunna returned his gaze steadily . " Oh , you can set your mind at rest ! I have n't told anybody . " " Told anybody what ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll do nothing to stop you here . " She made a faint movement of her hand toward Barnet 's office . " I thought-I thought your own conscience would be punishment enough . " She lowered her eyes . " Brought down the English ? " Marvin repeated stupidly . " How I brought down the English ? I ? " She looked up at him . " You thought I 'd never know , I suppose . You 've forgotten how news spreads among sailors . " " News ! " Marvin said . " Why , there never was a sailor 's tale that was n't a damned lie ! Like barbers , they never get things right , and you know it ! What is it you 're trying to say ? What is it Slade said , damn him ! You could n't truly think it was I " He stopped , staring at her . " You do ! By God , you do ! You little fool ! Slade told you , and you believed him ! You little fool ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from her ; then turned back to face her and spoke more quietly : " I take it you 're now Mrs. Slade , " he said . She looked at him with a steady eye . " Do you ? " she asked . " I would n't ask you the question , whether you are or , not , " he said . " Would n't you ? " " Do you think I care ? " he burst out . " Do you think I care on my own account any more ? Well , I do n't ! I 'll tell you what I care about : Your father was my friend , and that . means I care about his daughter 's safety . Yes , and that she is n't fooled by a pack of lies ; so , husband or no husband , P261I 'll speak out ! Husband or no husband , you 've believed a rat out of the swamps of Africa , and that 's what he is ! " " He 's kind and generous ! " Corunna cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She knotted her bonnet strings . " Let me pass , please ! " " Then it 's true ! " Marvin whispered . " You 're sailing with Slade ! " " No ! " she said . " He 's sailing with me ! With me ! He 's a brave officer and a resourceful rian , and as captain I 'm glad to have him for a first officer ! Let me pass ! " " I 've got a vessel , Corunna , " Marvin said . " You do n't know what you 're doing ! There 's a cabin for you on our brig , Corunna . " " A cabin ! What for ? For me to do needlework in ? " He was silent , gnawing at his lip and staring at her . " That 's your opinion still , I suppose ? " she persisted . " A woman 's judgment is too uncertain to let her handle a ship ? " " Why , yes ! That 's my opinion ! It 's my opinion that most women take chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , dear me ! " " What 's more , " Marvin continued , " it 's my opinion that most women do n't believe what 's told them unless it 's as unreliableas their own desires . If I told you as much truth about him as he 's told you lies about me --  " " What ? " she cried . " You 'd slander him ? " " Slander ! Do you think it 's never going to be proved how he sold the Olive Branch to the English ? " Corunna looked at him with the bitterest scorn . " He ? Ah , that 's your way out of it , is it ? To try to put it upon him ! Was n't it Captain Slade who led the men when they retook the Beetle ? And where were you when it happened ?   The last man out of the hold ! And were n't you in charge of the Olive Branch when the British cut her out ? Do n't yon suppose everybody knew you could have run her ashore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was white . " Slade sold you out ! He went to England and traveled the country with a common troll . He sold you out , I tell you , and divided the sale money of the Olive Branch with the English ; then blackmailed merchantsinto giving him a ship ! " " Indeed ! And how would it be possible for you to learn any such cock-and-bull story as this unless you 'd had it from the English themselves ? And why do you stop with blackmail ? Why do n't you tell me the poor man murdered little children ? " Marvin tugged at his neckcloth as though it oppressed him . " You 've got to listen to reason ! What chance do you think you 'll have with a man like Slade ? " She laughed contemptuously . " You 're all alike , you men ! Each one of you pretends he 's perfect , and that every other man is a monster ! You slander Captain Slade , and at the very moment you do it there 's a woman waiting for you ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance with Captain Slade as she has with you ? I think I have ! Oh , yes , I think I have i " " Corunna , " Marvin said slowly , " there 's nothing I could do or say , ever , that would influence you . There never has been . Sometimes it seems to me you 've always done and said the things that would make me feel most miserable . A times I 've wanted to take you by the shoulders and shake you for being so contrary , but I know now there 's no use trying to make you do something you do n't choose to do . When they put us in the hulks , Corunna , it seemed toP263me I 'd have to pull up the decks with my bare hands to get back to you . Well , I 've lost you . I could go to the Minister now with what I know about Slade , but I wo n't do it , any more than you 'd go to him with what you think you know about me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do it by force . " He waited vainly for her to speak . Then he said : " If you feel you 've got to go on with Slade , go ahead . I 've got one thing to ask  --  that you think it over for a few minutes right now . Either he 's a traitor and a liar , or I am . Well , you 've known me a long while , and him a short while , but he 's fascinated you . I 'll ask you to think it over and decide which you 'll believe  --  him or me . That 's all . I 'm going into that room for the commission this lady 's helping me to get . If you 're here when I come out , I 'll know you 've changed your mind about Slade . " He looked at her expectantly , but since she made no answer , he walked past her , tapped lightly on the Minister 's door and went in without a backward glance . It was only a short time later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him a commission authorizingCapt . Daniel Marvin of the private armed brig TrueHeartedYankee to take , burn , sink and destroy all enemy vessels . There was no one anywhere in the two outer offices except the green-eyed young woman , who was staring at the dirty windows . P264TOM SOUVILLE , hunched over the table in the barren cabin of the Renard , counted a sheaf of bank notes ; then lookcd up at Marvin and Argandeau and moved his small , pointed mustache so that he had the appearance of an astoundcd squirrel . " It is correct ! " he exclaimed . " Correct ! You have done it ! It is bizarre  --  a coup de theatre ! You Americans ! I have heard of nothing like it , ever ! You say you will do a thing , and almost immediately it is as good as done ! " " Not always , " Marvin said . " But I say yes ! " Souville exclaimed , jumping up and clasping his hands beneath his coat tails . " We have received , just now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is something exotic ! Something fantastic ! The Rossie privateer took and destroyed fifteen British merchantmenin forty-five days ; the Decatur took eleven in the same time ; the Saratoga has taken eight ; the Comet twelve ; the Paul Jones eighteen ; the Mars nine ; the Benjamin Franklin six . The English , they are having a crisis of nerves ! " " My friend , " Marvin said , " tell us the one thing we want to know . " Souville nodded . " I have found him . He is where you can not get at him . He is in Dublin . " " Where I can not get at him ? " Marvin asked . " That depends ! That depends ! He has n't bought a house there , has " he ? He is n't going to settle down , I take it . " Thoughtfully P265lie studied Souville 's eager face . " If you should keep companywith me in your Renard , do n't you think it probable that in time we might find some rich prizes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of your pendulum ? " SouvilV asked . " You 're laughing at me ! " Marvin said gravely . " You do n't want my pendulum . Your Renard might be mistaken for a clock ! " " No , no ! " Souville exclaimed . " I want it ! I will try , once , doing things in the American manner . You let me use your pendulum , and I will keep company with you . I will do more ; I will find you a crew of Americans , very fine ; not drunkards or vagabonds , but strong men from jails , capluredin prizes . In four days I find them , and that is none too soon ; for this man you want to see , who is now in , Dublin , I hear he will sail in eight days . " " Eight days ! " Marvin breathed . " Eight days , " Souville repeated . " Look , you let me use that pendulum and I cancel your dock charges  --  one thousandfrancs . " " What else ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded . " What else ? Nothing else should be needed between two brothers in arms . It is for the glory of France , and so it should be given freely , eh ? Ah , well ; I will act as your agent here , free of charge , makingsure that our thieves of officials do not strip you to the bone when you send in a prize . " " No , no ! " Marvin said . " What else about Slade ? Where is he going and what will he do ? " " What is it that you decide about the pendulum ? " Souvillepersisted .   Marvin nodded . " I 'll rig one for you . We 'll sail together . " Souville sighed comfortably , seated himself on his chest and folded his plump hands across his melon-like stomach . " What else about Slade ? Well , there is this about Slade : I n Bristol he got the Blue Swan brig , an old slaver , very fast . Four long nines she carries , and eight twelve-pound carronades . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers before she left ; and as she went , she collided with two merchantmenat anchor . Yet the whole affair was hushed at once , and the port authorities were like little children about it , wholly innocent and undisturbed . " He raised his eyebrows . " That can have only one meaning , my friend . There is British official connivance in whatever this Blue Swan brig is doing . " He nodded wisely , and Marvin stared bleakly from the stern windows . " On the following day , " Souville continued , " the Blue Swan appears in Dublin . There is scarcely one of these Irish ports where American privateers are not welcome . It k widely known , and with some reason , that so far as England is concerned , they are foreign ports ; that if opportunity is given to their citizens , they would take joy in burning any English frigate and crucifying her crew . I think your Slade has gone to Dublin , therefore , to be joined by a friend to whom he does not wish to appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his small mustache and stared at Marvin , who returned his stare with expressionless eyes . " In fact , " Souville went on , " I have heard from Middleburg , the port from which smugglers run to Dublin . Yesterdaya diligence arrived in Middleburg from Paris , and the passengers embarked in Dublin cutter -- two females ,   " I wish to hear nothing of that ! " Marvin said . " One of them a very fierce female , Very large , who swears terribly in four languages ; but the other , her mistress , a " Nothing ! " Marvin repeated . Souville shrugged his shoulders and manipulated his mustache . " Of course , " he resumed at length , " this obtainingof intelligence is less simple than is generally believed . It is thought that one man can put on false whiskers and find out everything in the world , but this is not so . No one man can find out more than a little about anything ; so when we wish to find out about something , we take fragments of information from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fragments from a woman elsewhere , and then we fit the fragments together in a picture , eh ? Sometimesthe picture is wrong , but more often it is right . " Marvin nodded . " I understand . " " Yes , " Souville said , " and I think we have put together the fragments of the picture of this Slade . The English , as I have told you , are in a crisis of nerves over the exploits of American privateers , who are doing more outrageous things to British merchantmen than have ever been done . Not long ago they were saying that if America dared to fight England , there would be no American flag on any ocean in six months ' time . And now behold ! Throughout England there are terrible cries of agony at the incessant successes of these damned Yankees ! " Argandeau coughed . " We do what we can , we Yankees , " he said . Souville eyed him severely ; then continued : " Already the British have persuaded some of your Yankee captains to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this is not enough . The process is too slow . What they need above all else are a few fast cruisers to work in company with a blockading squadron --  -- cruisers that would seem to be American , you understand , and so would not be annoyed by other Americans they might encounter . " " Cruisers that would seem to be American ! " Marvin exclaimed . " There would be several good points to such a service , " Souville continued placidly . " Such vessels would be under the protection of the English , and they could hoodwink the Americans ; yet , if they saw fit , they could disguise themselves and pick up vessels here and there from either side  --  provided their captains were blackguards , quite regardless of honor ; men desirous only of obtaining money , no matter by what means . " Marvin stared silently at him , his lips pressed tight together . Argandeau whistled softly . " Yes , " Souville sighed , " I think so . In eight days this brig of Slade 's  --  this Blue Swan  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Bristol was connived at by the government , so she will somehow be on government service . She has a crew of seventy men  --  which is too small a crew , as you know , to enable a vessel of her size to man out prizes ; and she has no coppers or leg irons aboard , so that she is not going back into the slave trade . What is more , a movement of government vessels has been ordered : A ship-of-the-line from Plymouth to Dublin with orders for Havana by way of Fayal ; a frigate from Portsmouth to Dublin with the same orders ; and a sloop-of-war fromP269Sheerness to Dublin , also for Fayal and Havana . There is no reason at all for these vessels to proceed to Dublin  --  no reason except to make the acquaintance of your Slade and his Blue Swan . Therefore , I say that he goes with the squadron to assist in the control of your privateers . I say that , in addition to some of the things we already know about him , he is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have pieced together . " Marvin wet his lips and clenched and unclenched his hands as though he felt a numbness in his fingers . " Fayal ! " he murmured . " Fayal ! A neutral port ! " He got to his feet and looked from the stern windows at his narrow brig . She was emerging , amid hoarse shouting , from a confusedtangle of men , gear and guns . New , slender and taunt royal and skysail masts had been swayed up , fidded and stayed ; and garrulous Frenchmen clung to ratlines , crosstreesand yardarms , reeving new rigging and seizing on chafing gear under Newton 's quick eye . The prolongation of her masts had given her a new look  --  a look of alertness . She was narrow still , and seemed , becauseof the absence of spring or rise in her deck , to lie as flat as a log in the water ; but she was clumsy no longer , for she rode with a new balance , having the look of being caught in a swift current and of straining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet there was something innocent about her  --  a look of helpless smallness  --  and although Marvin knew her to be three hundred tons and more , she seemed less than a hundred . Content at what he saw , he turned to Souville . " Find methe men you spoke of , " he said . " We 've got to get to sea . " Souville stepped to the cabin door and shouted shrillP270orders into the companionway ; then turned questioningly to Marvin . " And when we are at sea , " he asked , " what then ? For where ? " " Why , " Marvin said , " we 're for Fayal ; but as a matter of precaution , we 'll look in first at Dublin . " P271A SMART breeze from the northwest whipped the TrueHeartedYankee fast through a warm ocean in which floated clots of yellow weed , and from which skittered shimmeringfish that curved to left and right as if the threatening rush of her passing had given them wings . Wedge-like , she sliced through the watery hillocks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into royals and distant skysails and spread outward into studdingsails , so that the hull beneath seemed ludicrously small and helpless . Yet there was no helplessness on her narrow deck ; - for the tall Indian , Steven , resplendent in the blue jacket and the crossed yellow belts of an officer of marines , drove two sweating gun crews at the laborious task of exercising long eighteen-pound traversing pieces . With the precision of machines the heavy cannon rumbled forward to the weather bow ports , the crews as silent at their hauling as the men of any king 's cruiser . Boys ran beside them to place sponges , rammers and water buckets in neat piles abreast the trunnions . The two knots of men boiled around the carriages ; to the eyes of the officers on the quarter-deck , they seemed to scramble like ants on sugar . Tackles were made fast to eyebolts ; breechings were adjusted . With a rattle of chains the ports were triced up ; the two long toms lurched forward , their muzzles disappearing through the bulwarks ; quoins were rapped sharply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside the guns .   The Indian struck an iron triangle . At the clang the gunners , squinting at their sights , shouted , " One ! Two ! " There was no count of " Three ! " but in its place the linstocks of the gunners ' mates slapped hard against the touchholes of the guns . " Boom ! " bawled the gunners ' mates . The gun crews made swift movements with rammers and imaginary shot ; then snapped to attention . The Indian walked around the rigid crews , staring hard at them . Then he nodded . " Good ! " he said . " You 'll draw a gill extra , next mess . Count two after the pendulum strikes ; then let ' em have it ; and there ai n't anything in reason between here and Fayal that we ca n't blow out of water ! " On the quarter-deck , Newton , scratching busily on a scrap of paper held against the triangular cover of a sextant box , whistled softly ; then looked up at Argandeau , who leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket mirror . " Twelve knots ! " he exclaimed . " Twelve knots for twenty-four hours ! Two hundred and eighty-eight miles in one day ! That 's sailing , mister ! Two more days of that , mister , and we 'll raise Fayal ! " Argandeau smoothed an eyebrow and returned his mirror to his pocket . " We will raise what ? " he asked politely . " This place you mention  --  what was the name again ? " Newton looked at him coldly . " Fayal was what I said . You may have heard us speak of Fayal . " " Have I ever heard you speak of anything else ! " Argandeaucried . " Fayal ! Fayal ! Fayal ! Fayal might be heaven , it is so much in your hearts and on your tongues to be there ! I have had Fayal with breakfast , dinner and supper . since God knows when ! I would like to think a little of the two well-laden Britishers that we took in the Channel , thanks to our pendulum , and sent back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our fortunes and the coffers of that beautifulrabbit , Madame de Perigord , but I can not , no ! I can not hear myself think because of your clack , clack , clack about Fayal ! I would like to meditate on the way this cautious Old Man of ours , this Captain Caution , of Arundel , took us into the very harbor of Dublin and removed an Indiaman from under the guns of the fort itself . Hall ! There is something to think about , that , as well as how my dear Marvin ever earned the name of Captain Caution ! But to you and the rest of you , all these things are nothing . Fayal ! ' you scream . Fayal ! Fayal ! Fayal ! ' You are like uncivilized people , or infants , taking pleasure only in anticipation . " He sighed heavily , as if in despair . The door of the companionway slammed shut behind them . The two men turned to see Marvin staring upward with a frown at the brig 's upper sails . Argandeau lifted an eyebrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and eighty-eight miles , Dan , " Newton said . " That means Fayal day after tomorrow ! " Marvin rapped the bulwark with his knuckles . " And so to get us there , " he said , and his accusing glance included Argandeau , " you pile muslin on her till she looks like a feather bed ! Get in those studding sails and skysails ! Ca n't you feel her dragging ? " Newton ran forward , shouting orders . Seamen swarmed from nowhere , as if by magic , and scuttled up the shrouds . The studding-sail booms came in ; the skysail yards were lowered and their sails close-furled by men who seemed , like insects crawling on a ceiling , to defy the laws of gravity . The brig 's deck took on less of a cant : the waves through which she sliced seemed suddenly to lift her and press her on . " Just remember that , " Marvin said severely , as Newton returned to the quarter-deck . " Any fool or Englishman can crowd on canvas , so that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep our lee rails out of water and go faster . Give her all she needs ; not all she 'll stand . " He took two turns at the weather rail , watching the gun crews housing the long guns amidships . " I 've said it fifty times , but it 'll bear repeating : This is a war we 're in , and risks are the last things we want to take . " Argandeau laughed , and Marvin halted in his pacing to fix him with a questioning glance . " Yes , " Argandeau said . " Certainly yes ! There were some of us who had that in mind , Captain Caution , when you ran into Dublin Harbor in daylight , and then snatched away that merchantman in the dark . There was no risk to that , of course ; no more than picking up an alligator by the hind foot . " " I tell you there was no risk , " Marvin said calmly . " We ran in and anchored with the British ensign set over our American ensign . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were a captured American vessel , running for safety from the French privateer that pursued us to the very mouth of the harbor . Every man in the fort could see Souville 's vessel , and not one of them would ever think to look at us . You know yourself that if you do something openly with one hand , you can do anything you like with the other and never be caught at it , provided you do it quietly . To anchor under the guns of the fort was an extra bit of caution . " " Caution ! " Argandeau whispered , raising his eyes to the sky . " Yes , caution , " Marvin repeated . " When they saw us do it , they knew beyond any doubt that there was no harmP275in us , and so gave us no thought whatever . There is no surpriseso great as to do something you could not do if you tried to do it in the way you were expected to do it . " Argandeau moved his lips helplessly and shook his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him thoughtfully ; " Fayal is another matter . In Fayal we must be doubly cautious . " Argandeau raised an eyebrow and nodded understandingly . " Now you speak a language that has a meaning . You mean that in Fayal we must pick up two alligators by the hind foot . "
