Rush 10,000,000 Hippodamla convergens . <P> To an entomologist , 10,000,000 Hippodamla convergens means so many ladybird beetles-small , black-stippled yellow inhabitants of California 's high Sierras , fond of eating the eggs of the vegetable aphis ( louse ) which is a scourge of most truck farmers . To Robert Bogue , who is both an entomologist and a businessman , 10,000,000 Hippodamla convergens last week meant the biggest order yet received for his chief stock-in-trade . <P> Robert Bogue got a pencil , computed how much water would be necessary to keep 10,000,000 comatose ladybirds at the proper humidity during shipment from his bug nursery in Glendale , near Los Angeles , to the cooperative group of Virginia growers who wanted them to patrol some 16,000 acres . Packing case after packing case was withdrawn from the 60x40 ft. cold-storage room , the water carefully doused on the moss in the cases and the huge ladybird army started east under refrigeration . Then Robert Bogue sent a bill for $2,850 . <P> When Entomologist Bogue went to San Bernardino County Hospital to teach after the War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rounded up in the mountains and brought down to police vegetable gardens in the valleys , but that none were shipped out of California because they were so perishable . He began to experiment . Three years ago he discovered that in a temperature of 42 and a constant and definite humidity , the bugs would live indefinitely without feeding , could be shipped long distances . But even when warmed up the ladybird beetle is too temperamental to breed in captivity , so that every one shipped has to be captured . Bogue has squads of men prowling the slopes , shaking the bugs from bushes into boxes . Other eaters of plant-lice he successfully breeds and sells , but the ladybird is his headliner . He ships to all agricultural states , refuses to disclose the names of his customers fearing competition and possible price-cutting . He estimates that a grower can police his land with Bogue ladybirds at a cost of 15 or 20 per acre as against the dollar or more that spraying would cost . <P> Chicago-born 35 years ago , Robert Bogue graduated from Northwestern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University of London 's college of physiology and medical entomology . When War came he went to France to supervise latrine sanitation , iodization and chlorination of water , delousing . Using a pipette constantly he occasionally got a mouthful of tainted blood . That and the gum-hardening effect of precautionary alcohol gargles lost him all but a few of his teeth . He is married , has two children .
