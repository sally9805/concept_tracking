FANNY KEMBLE : A PASSIONATE VICTORIAN - Margaret Armstrong - Macmillan ( $3 ) . <P> Though the Victorian era has long been considered smug and lacklustre , readers of Victorian lives may yet decide that Victorianism turned out as many unconventional characters as Prohibition did drinkers . <P> Latest addition to the growing evidence of bootleg Victorian unconventionally is Margaret Armstrong 's story of Fanny Kemble , to whom Novelist Henry James , her close friend , paid this tribute : " She was one of the rarest of women . . . . She reanimated the old drawing-rooms , relighted the old lamps , retuned the old pianos . . . . An extraordinary mixture of incongruous things , of England and France in her blood , of America and England in her relationships , of the footlights and the glaciers in her activities , of conformity and contumacy in her character and tragedy and comedy in her talk . " <P> On no such level of eloquence and penetration as James 's monograph , Author Armstrong 's biography is nevertheless written with care and understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thanks to the fact that she quotes liberally from Fanny Kemble ' s own vivid journals , the result ably suggests the reanimating qualities that inspired James 's enthusiasm . <P> Born in 1809 , Fanny Kemble was the last of the celebrated , exceedingly proud , theatrical " Kemble dynasty , " the most famous of whom was Mrs. Siddons . The proudest , John Philip , whom Byron called " supernatural , " sulked in retirement because he was jealous of Mont Blanc . Spoiled by her father , owner of Covent Garden theatre , Fanny was so high-spirited that at her French boarding school the only punishment that could subdue her was seeing a guillotining . Until she was 19 the Kembles had no thought of making an actress of her . Then , as a last resort to save Covent Garden from bankruptcy , her father drafted her to play Juliet . With only three weeks ' rehearsal in the part , she became an overnight rage , paid off Covent Garden 's 11,000 debt in a year . When a cholera plague shortly afterwards put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took her to the U. S. on tour . <P> Among her U. S. admirers , the most ardent was a 13-year-old Brooklyn boy named Walt Whitman , who testified that " nothing finer did any stage ever exhibit-and my boyish heart and head felt it in every minute cell . " A year later , at the height of her fame , she quit the stage to marry the heir to a large Georgia plantation , handsome , dilettante Pierce Butler ( no kin to Supreme Court Justice Pierce Butler ) . Their marriage started badly , and got worse . When Fanny refused to compromise with social conventions , Pierce agreed with his family , who thought he had married beneath him . When Fanny published her U. S. travel impressions , which made a scandalous success , her in-laws ' opinion was echoed even by Poe.
