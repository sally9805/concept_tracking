MOTH MILLER A STORY BY SELMA ROBINSON FROM the Associated Press : A freight train on the New York , New Haven &; Hartford Railroad came to a sudden stop early this morning in the BrOUX . Members of the crew were mystified until they discovered that the automatic circuit breaker had shut off the power en a high-tension were overhead . Realizing that something must June come in contact with the wire , they instituted a search . . . When Camp Livingston shut for the summer , Johnnie Miller and old Frank Hepburn were left to close what remained of a bad season . Less than half the boys of other Livingston years had attended . The Livingstons did not even know whether they would return next year if business continued bad and parents were not rich enough to send their boys to camp . In other seasons there had been a waiting list and the camp had been lively and prosperous . " Seems to me they had nothing to eat but meat-balls , " old Frank said . " Meat-balls is cheap . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Anything 's good when there 's enough and you 're hungry . " Together they wrapped the mattresses in damp-proof paper . There were nearly one hundred mattresses to be trussed . The iron cots were taken apart and painted with grease to keep them from rusting . They nailed boards across the windows , doused the floors with disinfectant , scrubbed listlessly . For almost a week this had been going on . The campus was dead to Johnnie . To old Frank it was quiet for the first time in three months . No more noisy brats getting up to answer a silly bugle at half-past six , no more shouting in the dining hall ; that place was bedlam at meal-times , like a lot of young hyenas let loose . But to Johnnie it was flat and dead now . He was cut off and alone . The campers were his age mostly  --  two or three years younger , maybe fifteen or sixteen , but they seemed his own age or older . They were smart , always playing tricks on him , sending him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He used to go  --  it was always hard to tell when they were fooling Once in a while they 'd pull a chair from under him , but it was only in fun . Johnnie did not mind . They were a restive , turbulent lot , ready to slip away at nights , when opportunity offered , on mysterious expeditions of their own . They had their own pocket-money . Some of their fathers let them have cars . In a year or two they would go to college and get to be big men . But in spite of all that they were real kind . When Johnnie went down to Springfield to get the supplies he would run their errands . They would let him keep the change , no matter what . " Pretty nice fellows , " Johnnie said . MOTH " Real nice . It seems funny , all right , with everybody away . " " Seems better so , " old Frank replied . " If I was their father I 'd lay them over my knee . Smokin ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll bet . Finish spreading the lime , carry in the raft from the lake , and I guess we 're about through till next summer , if then . Seems to me things was so rotten this year there wo n't be no next . " He laughed without amusement or malice . Johnnie carried the last pail of suds out and emptied it on the dry , caked ground . All the brown cabins were empty . He knew their tenants so well : Buck Sterns , whose father was a packer ; Tom Kraus , who had swell neckties ; Tom Gilloon , who had a movie camera ; Fred Cohn who was a Jew but looked like Gene Tunney . Ile could almost see them leaping out of the doorways , pulling on their dark-blue sweaters so as not to be late for reveille . The flag would n't rise for nearly a whole year on the flagpole , Maybe not at all , old Frank said . Old Frank called , " If you 're about through mooning around maybe we can go down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shirt and pulled on a pair of trunks . Then he and old Frank went down toward the lake . His sneakers crunched down on pine needles and damp earth . Old Frank smoked and spat . " What you goin ' to do , Johnnie , now that the summer 's over ? " Johnnie laughed . " I got plans . " " Goin ' down to the A. &; P. in Adamsville for a clerk 's job ? " Ai No /1 " Better be pin ' pretty soon , then , young fellow , for a job is a pretty scarce animal these days . " Johnnie laughed again . " Not me . I got my plans . " Old Frank spat into the lake 's shal-low water . He undid the flat-bottomed rowboat from a tree and got in . Johnnie followed and took up the oars . The water was softly rippled with broken bits of blue where the oars bit into the reflection of the sky . Far on the other side there was a fringe of pines that looked blue against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the oars and made a soft noise . Frank spat into it again . " If I was you I 'd hitch me a hike over to Adamsville and get set up for the winter . You 'll need it this year , boy . " " I 'll get along , " Johnnie answered gleefully . " Winter do n't scare me none . " " Yeah ? Someone goin ' to leave you a million ? " Johnnie laughed scornfully . " Naw . Goin ' make it myself . " Old Frank listened without interest or enthusiasm . He reached over and took the oars from Johnnie . " You give me them paddles and get busy after the raft . Tic her up to the boat and I 'll row back . You can ride back on the raft if you like . " Johnnie dived in and reappeared in a moment . One by one , he unfastened the barrels that supported the raft . Then , when it was loose , he secured it to the rowboat and Tay across it while old Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high up on the beach . Johnnie held his arm out to Frank . " See that , " he said , " a leech . " " Throw it back in the water or leave it dry on the raft , " said Frank . " That 's what you 'd like me to be , " Johnnie said eager to speak ? " just a water leech stuck to a place like this till I die . Well , sir , not for me . " " No ? Well what you goin ' to be , boy ? A sailor and see the world ? They ai n't much world left to see , take it from me . Or a traveling salesman with nothing to sell ? You just put your pants on and rustle up to the A. &; P. before someone else gets ahead of you . This is goin ' to be a long hard winter for a boy that 's got no kin or money and not much sense . " Johnnie stripped off his wet suit and wrung it out . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his white flesh . His attenuated legs were angular and unmuscled , and he looked no more than fifteen . It took hold of Frank to look at him . Johnnie dressed himself in dramatic silence . Then when the last button was buttoned , he inquired : " Who said I got no money ? I got more money than I ever had in all my life . I been savin ' all summer . " " How much you got , kid ? " Johnnie was magnificently nonchalant . " I got about thirty-six dollars and seventy cents , " he said , not counting my new clothes . Tom Kraus give me a swell new checked sweater with socks to match . Fred give me some ties and a card to his father to put me in the butter business . That 's in case I want to go in the butter business . Fred says his father pretty nearly always stinks from handling the stuff . I might go into the bootlegging business with Alex Christenson , if he could get away from home . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drily . " But he 's big and smart for his age . " Old Frank laid his pipe down carefully on a flat stone . " Listen , kid , you ai n't got no father and no mother . You ai n't got nobody to tell you what a damn fool you are . So I 'll tell you . Sit down and listen . And when I 'm through , go get yourself some work . " Johnnie nodded his head . " I am goin ' . That 's what I 'm tryin ' to tell you . I 'm goin ' lookin ' for work to-night . " " To-night ? Where you goin ' ? " It was Johnnie 's moment . " New York , " he said . " You 're simple , " old Frank said after a shocked silence . " You 're plain simple , with less sense than the day you was born . You know how long your thirty-six dollars will last in New York ? " " Thirty-six dollars and seventy cents , " said Johnnie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay for every bite you eat . You got to pay for a place to lay your head . You got to pay for clothes . " " I got clothes , a swell new hot sweater and socks to match and ? " Old Frank held up his hand . " Socks to match . You think maybe you 'll be a caddy in New York ? Who wants a simple boy in a checked sweater ? If you 're lucky you might get a job scrubbing dishes in a beanery . Stay back here where you belong , Johnnie , with them that knows all about you . " " I know all them boys in New York . They promised to help me any time I say . " " They 're all in school , kid ; they 're stringin ' you anyway , like they always done . They could n't do a thing for you , even if they do remember you  --  which they wo n't . There 's nothing so dead as a summer friend out of season . Believe me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of boy you are ? I do n't like to tell you , but I have to . You always was a mite weak in the head . You ai n't exactly feeble-minded , kid , but you ai n't ever goin ' to be real bright , see . If you was smart and could handle yourself good , you could maybe study something and go to the city in a couple of years . But you ai n't got that kind of a head . You 're kind of simple . You ai n't right . " Johnnie shook his head slowly . " To-night , " he said , " I 'm goin ' to New York . I 'm pin ' to be rich and big and I 'm goin ' to make lots of money and have a car . I 'm goin ' to have all the girls there is . I 'll buy them lace things you can see through and bottles of cologne to put on theirselves . I might come down to this old camp , some day just for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was poor . I 'll show them this lake and this raft that I pulled in and this leech you wanted me to be like . " " You 're caught by those stories them fool boys told you . Like a moth miller . Johnnie Miller . You 're just a country moth , like I 'm tellin ' you . " Johnnie planted his feet wide . " To-night , about ten , I 'm goin ' to get on that Springfield train . Tomorrow this time be in New York . " " Do you know what your fare alone costs ? " " Do n't need no fare . I 'm hitch hikin ' from here to Springfield . There 's a freight leaves about ten , and I 'll be on her . A fellow is goin ' to show me how to do it so they ca n't find you . I got my checked sweater packed away and buy some sandwiches to carry along . And to-morrow morning , there be . " They went back to spreading the lime after that , Johnnie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say no more and storming over and over again at a boy who was too feeble-minded to see good sense . It was only nine when Johnnie arrived in Springfield . It was a gay city , all right , with plenty of movie theaters . He went to an ice-cream parlor and had a soda . Two ham sandwiches wrapped in wax paper were twenty cents more and a bar of chocolate was a nickel . The man tied them up in a small bundle as Johnnie directed . When he came out it was twenty-five after nine , and he wandered along the streets . That man at the tracks had told him not to come too early . It would rouse suspicion . The streets of the town seemed feverish . Lamps were bright , radios sang from doorways , groups of fellows were clustered near newspaper stands and theater entrances . Girls passed , wagging their hips and talking in loud , self-conscious voices . Johnnie called after one , and she turned to wave at him impishly . She was almost as pretty as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were even prettier than that . Though this was the city he had always hungered for , now it turned to nothing but a one-horse town for Johnnie . Small , shabby , imitation big . It was quarter of ten , and he turned toward the tracks . Not far from the station lunch room he met his railroad acquaintance and slipped him a dollar . That left thirty-five dollars and thirty-five cents , a neat sum . The man walked down toward the freight trains , whistling as he went . Johnnie followed after , at a short distance . When the man changed his tune , Johnnie got on the train , hand over hand as he had been told . The package bulged in his jacket , and he was almost weak with excitement . But everything was all right . The man still whistled . Johnnie heard him bleating " This is my lucky day , " until , at last , the train pulled out . The wind on top of the train was stronger than any wind could be . It was so loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he were marooned on an island , but an island that was being dragged through cold . It was an unreal night , and he could n't take it all in . He lay flat on his stomach the way the man had cautioned him . He tried to identify the first sleeping villages through which he passed , but they were anonymous in the blackness . At first he was startled by the train whistle , whoo-whoo-who-wh000000 , and by the spray it left on his face , but soon he did n't bother to wipe it off . This was himself going to New York , not someone he was seeing in a movie . He could picture how he must look in the darkness , with the wind blowing his hair hack like a cowboy hero 's . His lanky legs grew round and sturdy with new muscles , his face was stern with determination . But his sandwich was tasteless and clammy as he fed himself , bit by bit , so as not to raise his head much . Faster than the train , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , he would get off unnoticed . He would wipe the soot from his face , comb his hair , put on his new sweater set , and go to a swell restaurant with blazing lights and waitresses with short skirts . He would get a good breakfast and not count the cost . Then he would buy himself a new felt hat with a wide snap brim , and he would go out to find a career . Perhaps the butter job would be best . He saw himself presenting Fred 's card to Mr. Cohn , a tall , well set-up man with nose glasses on a black ribbon . Johnnie would say " Sir " and Mr. Cohn would call him " my boy . " He would put his arm round Johnnie 's shoulder and show him where the butter was made His salary would be fifty a week to start . The butter pails , filled , were sixty pounds each , but Johnnie could hardly feel them because of his powerful muscles . He would stack them so well that Mr. Cohn would raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with two pairs of pants . He would buy a pair of riding breeches , too , pale yellow , like Tom Gilloon 's , and he would go riding in the Park . Everyone would turn to look at how well he sat , like a man grown to the horse . The train clattered along with a sound like horses . Johnnie could hear the rhythm , but by and by he could no longer hear the horses ; only the sound of old Frank 's voice saying moth miller , moth miller , moth miller . His eyes were like no eyes at all , smarting with wind . His hands could hardly break the ham sandwich . The bread crumbled and lie had to tear the meat with his teeth . He rolled the wax paper into a ball , and in a second the wind had whisked it from his open hand . It was a long train and it looked like different things . As it pulled out of Hartford and Johnnie inched his way out of hiding and got back on top , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the station . But soon they were going fast again . Away up ahead , he could see the engine with its red coals , and the train was no longer a river ; it was an army and he was a king and they were all going to fight for him . The engine with its banners of red and white steam whistled horrible threatening blasts , two long , one short , one long . It meant get out of the way , you towns and cities ; stand back Meriden , Connecticut . Johnnie Miller is coming . Johnnie with thirty-five dollars and thirty-five cents . His army galloped along , and he galloped with them , wearing his new yellow riding breeches that he would buy in New York . He was riding along by himself now in Central Park , sitting erect , with a new riding crop under his arm . The train whistled again , and Johnnie saw the people in the park withdraw in fright . Toward him came a runaway horse with a girl clinging to its back . She was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face bloodless . Johnnie sized up the situation , and with a single cradling gesture too swift even for him to see , he had swept her from the wild horse , out of danger . She fainted in his arms and he held her like a baby . She was very light . A policeman came up to him and asked his name . John Miller of Red Ridge , Massachusetts . Do you know who this girl is ? She is the daughter of a millionaire , Mr. Vanderbilt . The rich father appeared and put his arm round Johnnie 's shoulder . He called him " my boy " and invited him to dinner . Johnnie came the next evening , dressed in a full-dress suit , and the girl , whose name was Gloria , served him with her own hands . She blushed prettily when he smiled up at her . The millionaire saw and smiled too . What do you do , my boy ? he wanted to know . Johnnie told him he was a butter weigher and he could lift a tub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . We need men like you : would you like to be a banker ? You can go to college first and then you can be a banker . Johnnie smiled and said if the little lady will wait for me , sir . She 'll wait , said the millionaire , and extended his hand . His second sandwich finished , Johnnie was still hungry . The night was darker and colder than ever . This was a strange place to be in . With his eyes open or closed , it was just as dark . Black , black and unfriendly . His eyes and ears were strained to little lights and sounds . The only familiar thing he heard was the sound of crickets as the train slowed down . They came to a full stop . This must be New haven where the train changed from steam to electric power . The railroad dicks would be there to inspect the cars , and it was up to Johnnie to look out for himself . The fellow he gave the dollar to had told him to hop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving , to hide himself in a shadow somewhere ; or if there was a dead freight train nearby , to hide there where he would n't show . The yard was a place of noisy , white light and deep shadow . Johnnie leaped to a coupling between two empty freight cars and flattened himself out , thanking his stars he was so skinny . The inspectors walked along the cars tapping wheels , swinging lanterns , shouting to each other . Presently it was all over . The warm old steam locomotive was unhitched and a powerful clean looking electric engine took its place . Johnnie jumped out of hiding , and as the train began to move he was safe on her . New overhead wires now appeared above the tracks . At intervals there were cross-bridges for street traffic , and he could see automobiles on them . He tried to count them but it made him sleepy . There must be thousands of bridges from Connecticut to New York and billions of automobiles . One of the first things he would do when he became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl 's head on the radiator . He saw himself in it . He was traveling at seventy miles an hour and wore a fur coat but no hat . A traffic cop stopped him . Where do you think you are going , young man ? Just then , Johnnie looked at him , and the cop apologized for not recognizing him . I thought at first you was one of those college boys , he said . I was a college boy and I played football on the team , Johnnie replied , but now I am a banker . I make over a hundred a week , added Johnnie . Why do n't you be a movie actor , you 'd make more , the policeman said . The only trouble is you must get past the doorman just like they tell you in the movie magazines but if you say you 're a friend of mine , they 'll let you in . I 'm a friend of the policeman , Johnnie told the city of Stamford as they passed through . I 'm a friend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water of Long Island Sound . Friend of the policeman , friend of the policeman , clacked the train on the rails . . . . The doorman let him in . What is your name , my boy , said a movie director , putting an arm round his shoulder . You are the type we are looking for . Come in and meet the stars . They were all in shiny evening clothes , just as he had seen them countless times in the movies . They shook his hand , and then drew back , the men jealously , the women in admiration . He was a born actor , the director said , a regular little trouper . When the picture came out , he was recognized in the audience and they asked him to make a speech . He was surprised at the number of big words that came to his lips . Men cheered and women applauded . Somewhere , he said , a little lady waits for me . This is all for her sake and I hope she will have me . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to him with millions of my own . How they applauded ! They came down to the train with a band to see him off to New York . They brought him flowers and asked for his autograph . But he could n't sign it . His hands were too stiff with cold . He held them next to his mouth to warm them and he could smell the chocolate on them . He licked the last remains of chocolate between his fingers and wondered how long it would be before New York . His eyelids were heavy and sore . His body ached . He was miserable with cold . It was no use trying to keep warm . It could n't be done , even if he had had his checked sweater on . The package hurt to lie upon . How long before New York and a good breakfast and a warm bed ? He forgot it all as the lights of New York finally appeared , glowing dimly at first , and spread like a fan . They grew brighter and brighter , more spread out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was New York . The skyscrapers . The big hotels . The perfumed smiling girls . The taxis and the street lights . Now Johnnie could see the tenements of the Bronx silhouetted blackly against the white glow in the sky . The trains were tearing themselves to pieces . Here comes Johnnie Miller , here comes Johnnie Miller . Home from Hollywood with a million dollars , home from Red Ridge and the closed camp and the leeches sticking to the raft . What would old Frank say now ? The air would soon be thick with ticker-tape and paper snow A band would play . People would shout . We want Johnnie . We want Johnnie for mayor . We want Johnnie . Someone called for a speech . Oh , it was beautiful , all that light and glory . It was like entering heaven at least . It was his city , his wonderful city where he would be king . Like a king , he rose to make his speech , steadying himself against the swaying of the train , first on his knees , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a sudden staggering blow on his head , quick , stupendous , as if he had struck a mountain The train stopped short . There were voices of men , the bobbing of lanterns which Johnnie would never see-. . . and discovered a boy tying unconscious on the roof of one of the cars . A package containing a sweater , socks , and a card identified him as John Miller , eighteen years old , of Red Ridge , Mass . He had been stealing a ride on the train to New York , when his head came in contact with a wire carrying 11,000 volts , interrupting the circuit and stopping the train . He was so severely burned about the head , that he died before reaching the hospital .
