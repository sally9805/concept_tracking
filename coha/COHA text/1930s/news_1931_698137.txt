Taylor . member of the finance committee of United States Steel Corp. , has been elected a member of the executive committee of New York Ceritral Railroad in place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Declaration of a dividend of $1 brings New York Central payments to stockholders for 1931 to a total of $13 . The first payment made this year amounted to $2 . This was followed by two quarterly payments of $1.50 each . The New York Central officials never call a dividend a regular payment . When the road was paying $2 quarterly over a. long period of time , they simply classified that a payment of $2 for that quarter . Therefore it was not surprising when the road announced " a dividend of $1 " and did not call it a $4 basis . For most purposes the stock can be considered on a $4 annual basis . A 84 yearly rate is the lowest paid by Central since 1899 . The rate was reduced from 89 annually early this year to $6 a year . During 1929 and 1928. $8 was paid . In 1927 stockholders received $7.75 . From 1924 through 1926 , they received $7 a. year . Since 1870 at least Central has paid dividends in each year . the rates varying from time to time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. Taylor as member of the executive committee of New York Central to fill the vacancy caused by the death of George F. Baker was a logical one in view of the fact that Mr. Taylor has been a director of the road for many years and was closely associated with Mr. Baker . Mr. Taylor has been prominent in industrial . railroad and banking affairs for some time , but public attention was not attracted to him generally until his election as chairman of the finance committee of the U. S. Steel Corp. , to succeed Judge E. 18 . Gary . and especially when through his efforts the bond 7. etirement plan for U. S. Steel was put into effect . At the time this action was decided upon , about the middle of 1929 , there was considerable agitation for a stock dividend or a split-up of U. S. Steel common shares However , Mr. Taylor was giving his entire time to the plan for retiring the bonded indebtedness of the corporation , preparing for a " rainy day " which came sooner than most interests had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside pressure was brought to bear upon Mr. Taylor and the members of the finance committee and board of directors of U. S. Steel for some special distribution to common stockholders , but careful consideration of all the factors led the management to adopt the bond retirement plan , which was one of the most successful in corporate history . At present the steel industry is looking to Mr. Taylor for leadership on the wage question . With costs maintained , operations at a low rate , demand limited , and various economies put into effect , the problem of reduction in the expense of making and selling steel products revolves entirely around the wages being paid , which are still at the level of 1929 , the period of prosperity and large steel company earnings . It is known that Mr. Taylor has been giving serious thought and consideration to this allimportant matter . Action is likely in the not distant future , but whatever is decided upon will be after weighing all the factors , with the view of being helpful and kindly wherever possible .
