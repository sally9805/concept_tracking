More and more does Chicago become conscious of its obligations to itself as a great city . With an eye to the World 's Fair of 1933 it is learning to wear a silk hat and carry a gold-headed stick . Last week was added a new note of Chicago elegance . <P> Created in the image of The New Yorker , five years ago The Chicagoan first appeared , drawing its inspiration from the East , its pocket money from the West . Publisher was Martin Quigley , a hardworking , red-headed newspaper man who had made enough money out of cinema trade magazines ( Motion Picture Almanac , Herald and Daily , Better Theatres , Hollywood Herald ) to take up polo . First issues reminded readers not so much of The New Yorker as of an imitation of a college funnypaper imitating The New Yorker . But the magazine improved with age , reported the local drama , sport , social goings-on with a ton which was cheerful if derivative . It also carried little comic stories by Chicago writers , jokes illustrated in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those Chicagoans who buy the magazine found a new kind of Chicagoan on their newsstands . This time Publisher Quigley had Vanity Fair in the back of his mind . Henceforth The Chicagoan ( circulation : 23,000 ) , enlarged to the page-size of The Spur , will cost 50 the copy , will appear only once a month . <P> The first big issue contained an article by Editor Peter Vischer of Polo ( which Publisher Quigley used to own ) on Chicago 's exciting fortnight of international polo at Onwentsia ( TIME , July 20 ) . Other contributors were talent mustered from around the town . Arthur Meeker Jr. , arty son of one of the best families , wrote rather harshly about having to stay in Illinois in the summertime . William C. Boyden , Harvardman , literary lawyer , did a comic piece about actors and actresses he had known . He used to be theatre critic for the earlier Chicagoan . Another old contributor-Durand Smith , Oxonian , Lake Forest socialite-sent in some travel notes from Italy . Helen Young wrote a page of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Examiner . William Randolph Weaver , younger brother of Poet John Van Alstyn Weaver ( In American ) and the magazine 's editor , wrote about soap models . C. J. Bulliet , theatre critic and art editor of the Evening Post , gave an elementary lecture on modern art . There were two pages in four colors , several pages of photographs in the modern manner , eight pages of illustrations in blue ink . All was put together with a finish and flair worthy of a national publication , to make a magazine worthy of bigger &; better Chicago .
