txt // acquainted with the habits of the deer , knowing when and where he ranged , and to be able to tell his tracks from other cloven-footed beasts and the time that had elapsed since they were made in the soil . Still hunts almost always took place early in the morning during autumn while the frost was on the ground . Experienced hunters would not hunt unless they were satisfied that the deer were feeding and the ground was moist . The greatest precaution had to be exercised . Since the sight of the deer was very quick , the successful hunter was particularly careful about the color of his dress , for any bright color , as scarlet , white or brilliant yellow attracted their attention . Hence he was careful to wear clothes of a brown or other dark color resembling as much as possible the color of old logs and the bark . All this , however , made confusion possible and there were tragedies when a fellow huntsman mistook a moving object in the brush .

In : Louisiana , fire hunting was particularly popular ; in this state , dogs were used . The gentlemen in their hunting frocks mounted on their horses , and with the attending dogs , and Negroes carrying fire pans , they proceeded to the woods where the deer were to be found.4 ' The whole cavalcade ? men and Negroes ? as seen at a distance , presented an interesting sight , particularly to a stranger unaccustomed to such methods of hunting . Fire hunting took place on still , misty , dark nights . For this hunt , the fattest pine knots possible were obtained and after being lighted were placed in a pan that was carried by a Negro . The pan , made of iron hoops , was in the shape of a frying pan , and was attached to a staff some five or six feet in length . The structure of the pan was open work , permitting air to pass through freely in order that the fire might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negro always swayed the pan backwards and forwards // horizontally , illuminating the objects far and near except the space kept in the shadow by the intervention of his head.43 Close on to the heels of the torch bearer were the hunters , usually two or three , with their guns and some bottles of brandy . When the pea patch or some other accustomed haunt of the deer was reached the Negro stood behind the pan of fire , waiting to detect two glistening balls in the distance . The ( leer were so attracted by the light that they stood still and fixed their eyes with steadiness and intensity upon the blaze , by the reflection of which from the eye balls they were easily discovered and shot . Experienced fire hunters could immediately distinguish the eyes of a deer in the darkest night at a very considerable distance from those of any other animal , first , by their brilliancy ; secondly , by their size and the distance between them . The distance of the deer was made clear by the size of their eyes . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what aim to take to be successful . A good marksman seldom failed to hit the deer in the head.44 It was found that other eyes besides deer were susceptible to bright lights , ? a man 's eyes glistened , and occasionally there were mistakes . Daniel Boone , the famous pioneer and hunter of Kentucky , is said thus to have met and " shined " the eyes of the girl who later became his wife . One veteran fire hunter of Lexington , South Carolina , in 1822 , even took three cracks at the fair , harmless moon which he mistook for a deer 's eyes as she rose through the bushes.45 Tame cattle turned into the woods to range often were killed along with deer . Such were some of the evils of fire hunting expeditions . Fire hunting was forbidden by the law , yet it was continuously pursued , being more like poaching than legitimate hunting . // GAME LAWS Such game laws as existed in England were not known in America . Here was an abundance of land which made game protection less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the people of America loved freedom . It was one of the blood-bought privileges of this country that the law recognizes no order , distinction or rank in society . Hence these vestiges of feudal oppression found little hospitality in America . There were game laws here , it is true , but they were not to favor any privileged class . Each state had its own separate code for the protection of game as it saw necessary . There were periods of the year when certain game was in season , at which time the sportsmen were allowed to shoot the specified animals . The states were slow in passing game laws of any sort . As late as 1828 the settlers in Potter County , Pennsylvania , petitioned the legislature to forbid the killing of deer in that county by non-residents because the deer furnished food which many of the inhabitants depended upon . This petition was denied . The committee considering the subject reported : " By the Constitution and laws of the country , every man from the President to the country peasant is entitled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of public freedom could desire it should be otherwise . To give the residents and landholders of Potter County the sole and exclusive right of taking and destroying game within the limits of the county , your committee respectively conceives would be one step toward destroying that equality of privileges which is the pride and boast of the county to enjoy . " 46 This was really the spirit of America , the insistence upon equal privileges and opportunities for all . British travelers in America were astonished and delighted to find few game laws . John Bernard was one of the Englishmen who enjoyed the freedom of shooting in America . He made the following comment : " And here were no game laws to tax the pocket and principles of an Englishman . You could take v our rod or gun , jump over a gate and wing or hook your // victim before the door of a mansion without the trouble of inquiring to whom it belonged . Here was no eternal , ' Trespassers beware , ' or Spring guns ' to warn the reader that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's . The benevolent Americans forgave every man his trespasses , and pointed their guns only at the enemies of their country . " 47 The freedom of gunning and shooting prevailed in America in every state until many varieties of birds , particularly heath hens , woodcocks , quail and partridges were destroyed to such an extent that there was fear the species would become extinct , or at the least become so scarce that the joys and pleasures of a hunt would be decreased . Laws for the preservation of birds were desired by a number of people before such laws were passed . Mrs. John Adams in 1790 , almost wished for game laws for the protection of the partridges , the woodcocks and the pigeons , as she viewed from her New York home the Jersey shore thronged with birds rejoicing in their liberty and security.48 Beginning with the seventeen nineties and continuing throughout this period , several states became interested sufficiently in the protection of their birds to pass game laws f6 : their preservation . New York , the state in which so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protecting partridges , quails and woodcocks within the county of Queens or Kings or within the city and county of New York between the first day of April and the fifth day of October . This law , however , was not enforced . Game continued to be destroyed , and land trespassed upon at a season of the year when great injury was sustained . This disregard for a state law aroused the better class of sportsmen of New York to form an association for the express purpose of preserving game by enforcing the game law of 1795 . The first attempt at such an organization was the Brush Club of 1805 , which had for its object the preservation of grouse.49 The members of this club pledged one another not to hunt any // game within the time prohibited by the law of the state . This society published extracts of the law of 1795 believing many persons were unacquainted with the law which had been practically dormant so long . The state of Massachusetts in 1818 passed a law protecting partridges and quails during the six months after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Philadelphia flocked in the months of August and September for grouse shooting , passed a law in 1826 protecting not only grouse , but also woodcocks and partridges from February to September first . This statute applied to the whole state , New Jersey thus becoming the only state in the Union at that time wherein a game law had such general application . Other states enacted laws only to suit particular counties within their bounds , upon the request of the inhabitants petitioning for the protection of the game in their neighborhood.51 The deer was early protected by law , no doubt because early settlers depended so generally upon this animal for food ; in fact closed seasons had been provided for deer in all the colonies except Georgia . Between 1800-1835 virtually every state , with the exception of the West , passed laws regulating the season for deer hunting , thus preserving an important source of food for many American people . CHAPTER III FISHING Fishing has ever been enthusiastically practiced in America by all classes of people , some for a livelihood , others for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important rivers frequently depended upon their fisheries for their means of support . Regardless of its economic aspect , fishing became a popular diversion , enjoyed by the old as well as the young , and attracting the best , most eminent and wisest of men as well as the careless ne'er-do-well . Governors and senators have been passionately fond of the sport ; various presidents from Washington to Hoover have enjoyed it . During this period fishing was the only field sport which was permitted by general consent for preachers . Did not the apostles themselves cast nets , albeit it was for a living and not for amusement ? Fishing was looked upon as a meditative and solitary sport . The reverend angler was supposed to find " texts in running brooks " and to be arranging the heads of a sermon in his mind while putting on a worm . School masters found a rest from their duties in like excursions . It was nothing uncommon to see the serious minded pedagogue on Saturday afternoon wandering alone , with rod in hand and a copy of Shakespeare in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rural sports , none was considered more innocent than fishing . Angling , as the fishermen of 1800 might have said , did not degrade or debase the faculties of either mind or body , but gave to each that salutary exercise which was considered essential to its preservation and improvement . The vigor of body and elasticity of mind derived from the exercise in the early morning air was worth the effort required in rising at dawn to pursue the finny tribe . Angling was earnestly recommended to those whose constitution had been impaired by a too sedentary life or by dissipation , for unlike other rural amusements , it did not over fatigue by the violence of exercise required . It afforded a gentle exer-1551 // cise , which with the free circulation of pure air tended to recruit nature . ' On the other hand , it was said , angling tended to make man a philosopher . In this sport he learned lessons of wisdom , resignation , and forbearance . Success in fishing called for patience and perseverance , a knowledge of the haunts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rational mind and a capacity to he contented with the pleasure of pursuit without the concrete reward of good fish . The pastime of angling was supposed to have an influence on the temper and feeling of man . Being in the midst of nature , in the pursuit of the fish , was sufficient to excite the feelings of the highest order of enjoyment , feelings which tended to make him , on his return to duties and his employment a more amiable and more useful man.2 Indeed , there was a calmness and repose about angling which belonged to no other sport , and scarcely to any other exercise . Being alone amid the beauties of nature called into play the noblest feelings of man ? benevolent wishes to neighbors , and general philanthropy to mankind , while scandal , backbiting , evil thoughts and evil words withdrew into the background . Angling was lauded as one of the most desirable sports and many songs in its praise were written . The following is one which , we are assured , was popular : We no pleasure shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends in strife and clamor , And in sorrow drowns the soul . Sports of mighty Nimrod 's chusing , All your mischief I will shun Broken bones and grievous bruising , Glorious scars of hunters won . Come , thou harmless recreation , Holding out the angler 's reed , Nurse of pleasing contemplation , By the streams my wanderings lead . // On the flowery border sitting , I will dip my silken line ; And weak fish alone outwitting , Curse all other sly design.3 America produced some skilful anglers at this period . Daniel Webster was a very successful trout fisherman , and Sergeant Prentiss boasted of being another.4 The sport of angling gave Webster many opportunities for composit'on . It is said that the following passage was first heard by a couple of huge trout immediately on their being transferred to his fishing basket , as it later was heard at Bunker Hill by many thousands of his fellow citizens : " Venerable men , you have come down from a former generation . Heaven has bounteously lengthened out your lives that you might behold this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that on the day preceding the one which it was expected he would deliver the address of welcome to General LaFayette in Boston in 1825 , he happened to be out in his fishing yacht . Fish were not abundant and his companions were just about to give up in despair when Webster hooked a very large cod , and just as it appeared at the top of the water , he exclaimed in a loud and powerful voice : " Welcome ! all hail ! and thrice welcome , citizen of two hemispheres. " 5 As an angler , no man perhaps was ever more ardent and enthusiastic . It may have been in some degree due to the influence of this recreation that he was able when necessary to undergo such continual labor as that which fell to his lot at Washington . Other men who were particularly fond of fishing at this time were Henry A. Wise , Amos Kendall , and Dr. Lyman Beecher . Wise often fished for days at a time , thus becoming not only a devoted but an expert disciple of Izaak Walton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who taught him to become as skilled in handling a sail boat as any skipper.6 Dr. Beecher fished frequently with line and // hook and apparently for health 's sake . In his autobiography , speaking of angling , he says : " Easy exercise ? opening the chest , and breathing the fresh air ? how good it was ; gained in this way until I could try gunning instead . " 7 Amos Kendall was a devoted fisherman both with the rod and spear , and many hours he spent thus particularly during his early years along the margin of Solomon Brook , which ran through his father 's farm. ? It was known by the successful fishermen that there was an art in angling , that there was something more than drawing out the fish after it had bitten the fatal hook . Both skill and dexterity were recognized factors necessary to success . Experienced anglers could catch numbers , while in the same part of the streams and under similar circumstances , those who were inexperienced caught nothing . The scientific angler knew well the influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what degree of warmth or cold was best , and what state the stream should be in after much rain in order to insure success. ? Easterly winds , it was thought , were usually unfavorable to the angler and the southern winds the best . A warm , but lowering day was most of all to be chosen . It was noticed that on a cloudy day after a bright moonlight night fish bit freely . The best season for angling was from April to October ; the best time of the day from three to nine in the morning and from three to sunset in the afternoon.10 The angler 's first business , says an old time writer , was to attract the fish to the place intended for angling . The method of doing this in standing water was by throwing in grain and boiled bread . In running rivers , a thin box containing worms , and bored with holes with a plummet to sink it and a line to draw it back at pleasure , was used . In the proper place this box was thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the angler stood under cover . The worms which slowly and gradually crawled out of the box were a great inducement to the fish to hover about to feed upon them . With a baited hook , the angler was ready to begin his sport . In the United States , every river , creek , brook , pond or lake abounded in fish of various sorts . However , the ones which attracted the most attention by those who followed angling as a sport were salmon , trout , pike , perch , sunfish and roach , besides others which were peculiar to the lakes . The well known methods of catching fish consisted of netting , bobbing and angling with rod , hook and line . The net was used only when the angler was disappointed in his rod and line . Angling with rod , hook and line in rivers , creeks and ponds furnished the chief sport in pursuit of the finny tribe . However , fishing was done in some of the important harbors at this time . Fishermen procured boats and rowed out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and let the boat drift until a fish " struck " when he would be hauled into the boat . This type of fishing was not commonly followed for sport , though Dr. Lyman Beecher practiced it and pronounced it good exercise.11 Fishing apparatus engrossed a great deal of time and work . Rods , lines and hooks were imported from London , while a number were manufactured in America . Some dealers in the United States kept every item used in fishing , such as rods with three and four joints , best spun lines , fly cases and hooks , artificial flies of all sorts , knots of best gut and rings of India grass.12 David Ramsay , speaking of fishermen in South Carolina , said : " They fabricate their own lines and nets . In these fabrications they display taste and ingenuity ; and this is the only species of manufacturing that is practiced among them . ' ' 13 A variety of baits , living , artificial , or dead , were used for the hooks . What bait was most efficacious was pondered // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bait that was likely to allure any particular kind of fish , one fisherman said , was when one was caught to open it and examine the stomach ; and whatever was found there was considered proper bait for others . Paste sometimes was used on hooks . When this was done a little tow was used to keep it firm . Honey was also applied , and later butter , which tended to prevent the paste from being washed off.14 Bait for most trout fishing , then as now , was lob worm , earth worm , dung worm , and maggot . Scientific trout fishers , however , used the artificial fly attached to a long fine line , wound upon a reel which was fastened to the handle of the pole . Artificial flies were bought and homemade . To find out the various kinds of flies that frequented certain streams and to make ones like them necessitated a considerable degree of skill and experience . Whether to make a fly with wings or without , such as palmer or caterpillar , whether it was to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire , had to be decided . Next came the question of material . Was it best to make a fly of wool , mohair , ostrich feathers , or other materials.15 The thoughtful angler carried in his pocket material for making artificial flies ? such as feathers , fur , silk of various colors , wax , pieces of gut , hooks of different sizes , a sharp knife , pair of sharp pointed scissors , and a large needle.16 In purchasing artificial flies , there were upward of one hundred varieties to select from . Expert fly anglers made themselves acquainted with several forms , the number of wings and every other particular in order that he might be able to know every difference between the various kinds . There were the red and black palmers , red and black hackles , grouse , red and black flies , the yellow May fly or green // drake , small black gnat flies , the red spinner and the white moth.17 Fishing with an artificial fly was accepted as a very pleasant and gentlemanly way of angling . The fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or weight , nor had he the dirty work of digging clay , making bait , etc . He could travel for miles with a book of flies in his pocket , , and a light rod in his hand , casting in his bait as he roved on the banks of a stream without soiling his fingers . It was , therefore , preferred by many to every other way of angling.18 The sport of fishing was carried on by groups as well as by individuals , and among the early recreations of the American people were the fishing excursions in the spring and summer , prized chiefly for their social value . Boats accommodating twelve and fifteen persons were often employed for a day on the water ; the party fished as long as they desired , and then spent the rest of the time sailing on the water . Refreshments including wines were served on the boat.19 Hotels and summer resorts located near the waters made provisions for fishing parties with everything necessary for fishing , such as lines , hooks , bait and excellent food . Places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer to enjoy angling and other amusements offered . Fishing parties among the farmers and in small towns were very agreeably arranged . Twelve to twenty neighbors formed themselves into a sort of club and agreed to fish one day in the week , usually Saturday , during the summer season . The party divided into two rival sections to enjoy the sport of fishing . After the groups were through with angling , they united , bringing their fish to be cooked for dinner ; about one o'clock it was that they all met at the place of general rendezvous where all hands were employed in preparing the fish for cooking , by which means the dinner was soon on the table which had been especially erected for the occasion . With the fish , the cold victuals , liquor and // wines brought , appetizing dinners were served for the hungry anglers.20 Late in the afternoon the ladies began to arrive . The company amused themselves in catching fish for supper , walking in the woods , pitching quoits , swimming , singing , or playing some musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole party went home with one of the members to enjoy further amusements.22 Clubs among the fishermen were not numerous . There were , however , a few angling clubs . The Schuylkill Fishing Company founded in 1732 at Philadelphia was considered the oldest club of sportsmen in America . The purpose of the organization was for exercise and conviviality . Two stated meetings were held each year , in March and in October for business purposes . The stated and first gala-day of the sporting season was held on the first of May and meetings for fowling and fishing were held on Thursdays , once every two weeks until the election in October when the season ended . The organization adopted a common seal and a set of rules which were strictly adhered to . Every member of the organization was provided with his own bateau , tackle and bait , apron and hat . The cooking was done by the members . A delicious , refreshing luncheon was always provided by the hour of twelve when the weary fishermen returned in their boats from their excursion ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the table . No one was allowed to partake of this dinner after one o'clock.23 In 1825 LaFayette paid the company a visit and was received in full state . The members were dressed in fisherman 's style , wearing white linen aprons and angle straw hats . General LaFayette was elected honorary member . After he was invested with the apron and hat , he paid attention to the turning of the steak on the gridiron . An elaborate banquet followed with appropriate songs and speeches.24 // Some anglers in the city of Cincinnati in 1829 united themselves under the style and title of the Cincinnati Angling Club . A constitution was adopted , and by-laws established for the future government . The number of members was limited to twenty-five . Four regular meetings were to be held each year . The last meeting took place the first Thursday in October , which was the anniversary of the club . At this time the members of the club dined together and had either a discourse delivered to them upon angling and ichthyology , or a chapter read to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 2 ' The chief object of the association was to spend in healthful and rational recreation those hours of relaxation from the toils and labors of life which the constitution of human nature required.26 By this club , fishing was accepted as the most salutary of sports ? that which was essential to the preservation of health and improvement of the mind . One member of the club , speaking at an anniversary meeting , said : " Our recreations are the legitimate sources of human pleasures . They are the pleasures of the angler . For the enjoyment of such gratifications , he abjures the influence of sloth and idleness , as you have done on the present occasion , and goes forth as soon as the high lawn appears under the opening eyelid of the morn , ' and long before the star of day ' flames in the forehead of the morning sky , enjoys the delights of invigorated health and the anticipations of successful exertions. " 27 Scandal and gossip were thought incompatible with the character of those who were worthy of the honorable certificate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disposition to indulge in either of these vices was considered " indicative of a diseased state of the body and mind . " Fishing by the early thirties was growing as a social diversion and angling clubs were being organized in many places . CHAPTER IV BALL PLAYING The time when ball was not played in America is unknown . Playing ball was a favorite game with the Indians . Men , boys and even women have always played ball in some fashion everywhere there was open space , whether or not there was any particular name for the sport . In some places , indeed , the game had to be controlled by law . Worcester , Massachusetts , in 1816 passed a regulation prohibiting the playing of ball in the public streets of the town in order to protect the safety of the inhabitants . ) In 1828 , due to the nuisance of ball playing in New York City , the New York Evening Post had the following to say : " Let any one visit Washington Parade , or indeed any of the fields in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and boys playing ball and filling the air with their shouts and yells . At present the annoyance has become absolutely intolerable to those who live in the neighborhood of which we are speaking , and ought to be put an end to without delay . " 2 Students at the different colleges played ball . At Princeton in 1787 , the faculty prohibited the sport on account of its being dangerous as well as beneath the propriety of a gentleman . The prohibition reads : " It appearing that a play at present much practiced by the smaller boys among the students and by the grammar scholars with balls and sticks in the back commons of the college is in itself low and unbecoming gentlemen students , and inasmuch it is an exercise attended with great danger to the health by sudden and alternate heats and cold and it tends by accidents almost unavoidable in that play to disfiguring and maiming those who are engaged in it for whose health and safety as well as improvements in study as far as depends on exertion we are accountable to their parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inasmuch as there are many amuse- // ments both more honorable and more useful in which they are indulged , therefore , the faculty think it incumbent on them to prohibit both the students and grammar scholars from using the play aforesaid. " 3 Regardless of prohibitions , ball playing in some manner continued among the college boys . Daniel Webster when in Dartmouth ( 1797-1801 ) speaks of " playing at ball . " 4 At Brown University in 1827 , ball was a familiar diversion.5 The game of ball throughout this period was more of a participant 's sport than a spectator 's . So little enthusiasm was shown in the pastime that spectators would have found no interest in looking on . The game as a whole was for the individual player , there being little team work displayed . Contests were rare . No one at this time would have dreamed of a ball game that would have created interest and stirred the enthusiasm of the masses as games of football and baseball do today . From all accounts one of the earliest games of ball played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players . In this sport were two bases placed some twenty yards apart with the batter at one and the pitcher at the other . The catcher stood behind the batter and in cooperation with the pitcher tried to " put out " the batter . The batter 's office was to strike the ball to such a distance that he could run to the other base and return before he was hit with the retrieved ball . He held his position as batter until the ball was caught on the fly or until he was hit by the ball in running from one base to the other.6 When more players entered the game , it was called twoold-cat , three-old-cat , four-old-cat , etc. , depending upon the number in the game . Two-old-cat differed from one-old-cat in having two batters at opposite stations , as in the old English stool ball . In this form of ball , at every stroke of the kill the batters exchanged places . During this exchange , // catching the ball , hitting one of the batters , or casting the ball across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hastening , threw him out . When a batter was " put out , " the catcher went to the bat , the pitcher to catch and so on again until the next batter entered. ? Three-old-cat required six players and three bases , and four-old-cat four bases and eight players . Town ball soon developed from four-old-cat . In this game players were divided into two groups which competed against each other . The players used a square field , sixty feet on a side , with a base at each of its four corners . The batsman stood in a space four feet square located between the first and fourth base . The pitcher was stationed in a space at the center of the square and pitched the ball to the batter . The number on each side varied from ten to twenty , and the rule was one out all out . A base runner was out if hit by the thrown ball while running to the base , and the batter was out if the ball was caught on the fly or first bound.8 In 1831 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of town ball , and it is reported that the first day for practice not enough members were present to make up town ball , so a game of two-old-cat was played.9 In New England , town ball was played under the name of the " New England Game . " This game was a popular pastime with the New Englanders until 1857 when they began to play the " New York Game " of baseball . From town ball to baseball was a short step . However , the so called baseball during this period was nothing more than town ball in some form . Baseball is spoken of as early as the eighteen twenties . Oliver Wendell Holmes said that baseball was one of the sports of his college days at Harvard.10 Thurlow Weed speaks of a baseball club in 1825 at Rochester , New York . He says in his autobiography : " The citizens of Rochester found leisure for rational and // healthful recreations . A baseball club numbering fifty members met every afternoon during the ball playing season . Though the membership of the club embraced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the old.11 This game of ball was played under various rules and regulations until 1845 when a number of New York men formed themselves into an organization under the name of the " Knickerbocker Club , " which was the first association of baseball players . This club drew up a constitution and by-laws , which contain the first written rules of baseball . The sport of cricket was played to an extent in every section of the country at this period , and even before the Revolution . Shortly after the war cricket clubs became active and the game was being played by the people of almost all ranks . As early as 1790 Boston knew about cricket clubs , 12 and by 1794 the New York Cricket Club was meeting regularly , usually at Battins Tavern at six o'clock in the evenings.13 Match games were played between different members of the club , wickets being pitched exactly at two o'clock . The clubs were social in nature , necessary refreshments always being provided both at a meeting of the club and at the games . Even though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be kept in mind that the sport was more English than American , and certainly was most popular with English immigrants . The length of time , usually two days , which was required to finish a game , was a desirable feature of the sport to an Englishman , while to an American it was a serious handicap . However , there were some commendable qualities of the game to the American people at this time . It was a game of bodily skill and required physical activity , courage and great self-control . The South never participated in the game as much as the North , probably due to the Southerner 's enthusiasm for the chase , horse racing and other sports of a more exciting na- // ture , though beginning with the ' twenties cricket became more widely played in the South . Judging from the newspapers , however , it had been played long before . The Southern Patriot of Charleston , South Carolina , carried the following notice , January 23 , 1821 : " The members of the old cricket club are requested to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at seven o'clock on business . " During this year cricket seems to have been regularly played . Members of the club through the Southern Patriot were requested to meet at the race course at one o'clock for the game.14 Obviously matches of importance did not take place among southern players as among the northern devotees . Nevertheless , cricket was played even at the end of house raisings and trainings . The game was played along with quoits and other games of skill and strength . Parties were formed to go on fishing trips and picnics and during the outing , cricket was one of the games pfayed.15 The most outstanding cricket matches of the period were those in New York . In fact , the matches of note were played in that city . These contests took place between members of different clubs , and often the sport lasted for two days . Great was the interest if any English player happened to be present to participate in the sport . June 16 , 1820 , eleven expert English players matched eleven New Yorkers at Brooklyn , the contest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the season . The hope of defeating any Englishman in a match was the source of much excitement and interest . The rough and tumble game of football was played in America even during the colonial period . Football in the modern sense , however , was not played in the United States until the middle of the nineteenth century . Until that time it was played in a very irregular manner , scarcely more than kicking a ball around . Without organization or any sys- // tematic way of playing the sport , it was carried on , giving exercise and pleasure to the participants . In the autumn before the approach of winter , football was played and was pursued differently in various places . In some districts even heads of families engaged in the sport and fishermen along the coast of New England participated . Doubtless it was considered by many a rough diversion , detrimental to clothes as well as endangering the lives and safety of the people , and some of the more refined and fastidious class refused to play football , preferring sports of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Massachusetts , says : " The bruising of shins has rendered it rather disgraceful to those of better education . " 17 Football naturally found its way into colleges even though there were prohibitions against it . As early as 1765 , the undergraduates of Yale played with foot and hand . Boys were not allowed to " scrimmage , " but they were permitted to punt , as it would be called today.18 Charles Haswell , speaking of sports of the Columbia students , says : " In the fall of the year , a few students would meet in the ' hollow ' on the battery and play an irregular game of foot ball generally without teams or sides ' as they then were termed . " 19 The ball used in this game usually was a blown up bladder covered with leather , or a saw-dust-filled leather bag . By the beginning of the nineteenth century football playing became a little more pronounced . Franklin B. Dexter in his article " Student Life at Yale College under the First President Dwight ( 1795-1817 ) " says : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of a well known New Haven engraver , Amos Doolittle , shows in the foreground a game of foot ball on the Public Green , played by students wearing tall hats , swallow tail coats , and knee breeches , with President Dwight himself occupying the side walk in the full // majesty of a broad brimmed beaver and academic gown . " 20 Very likely President Dwight was viewing the game from the standpoint of detecting any movement that would be injurious to morals or degrading to the institution rather than for the purpose of obtaining enjoyment as a spectator . By the ' twenties , football existed as a diversion at the different colleges where seniors and sophomores lined up against juniors and freshmen . In 1827 , the first Monday of the fall term was known at Harvard as " Bloody Monday " because of the customary game between the two lower classes on that day . At Yale these class contests took place too . They were fought with great persistency , especially when the contests were sophomores and freshmen . This so called " game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event , and was little less than a thinly disguised fight , the presence of the ball being an excuse for the assault of the two bodies of students upon one another.t1 Yale College in 1822 prohibited football playing in the college building or in the college yard . The law reads : " If any student shall play at hand or foot ball in the college building or in the college yard ; or throw anything by which the college building may be in danger of damages , he may be fined not exceeding fifty cents , and if he refuses to desist when required by one of the faculty , he may be suspended , sent home or dismissed . " 22 Throughout this period and even until the ' seventies , foot ball had little encouragement , and as a result it was played very irregularly without any attempt toward organization . There were no intercollegiate games , nor any real games among the classes of the same school . Golf is usually considered a recent sport , imported into the United States and having been first played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records show , however , that this sport was played in this country // at a much earlier date . In 1790 it was being played in Charleston , South Carolina , very likely by Scotch and English immigrants who were already acquainted with this Scotch game . At this date the sport took place on Harleston Green when the recreation was almost unknown elsewhere in America.23 Notices of the Golf Club of Charleston appeared in the City Gazette and Daily Advertiser in 1796 . Members of the club were requested to meet at two o'clock on a certain day to elect officers for the ensuing year and transact business of the club before dinner , which was served at half-past three o'clock.24 The Savannah Daily Republican in the latter part of the year 1818 had notices of a golf club as follows : The members of the Savannah Golf Club are hereby notified that the regular meeting and dinner which should take place on Friday next , the first proximo , is postponed until Friday , the eighth on which day the members are requested to attend at the usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is evident that golf was played in Savannah before that date . This club as shown by the Savannah Daily Republican met at different intervals for two years , 1818-1819 . For two months , January and February of 1819 , the club met every Friday at two o'clock for dinner at Mrs. Gribbins , who kept a boarding house on the bay . Business was transacted before dinner . February 26 , 1819 , the weekly meetings were ordered discontinued and after that date the club met only when the president saw fit.Y6 The last meeting which was to have been held December 31 , 1819 , was postponed to January 7 , 1820 . Whether or not the club met then is not recorded . No further notices of clubs appear during this period . The reason for the discontinuance of this golf club is not divulged . A natural conclusion to reach , however , is that // the American people at this period of history were not able financially to support such a sport . This reason , if no other , was sufficient for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One can not imagine the people in the early nineteenth century with sufficient money and leisure time to build a thirty-six hole or even a nine hole course as is found in every section of the country today . Society in America was not ready for a sport of this nature.27 The English game of fives was a popular sport in the United States at this time . The sport was conducted either in a closed or an open court , but more often in an open court of various shapes and proportions . For the playing of fives in the open , a good wall was erected with a round flat piece of ground in front of it . This wall often was forty feet in length by thirty in height . If a closed court was used , the alley was of corresponding length and breadth carefully leveled , tightly packed and swept clean.28 Three lines were drawn so as to form with the bottom of the wall a square to mark the bounds . A line also was drawn on the wall about three feet from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winner began by bounding his ball on the ground and striking it against the wall above the line so that it would rebound vigorously . The other player struck it in the same manner either before it had touched the ground or on the first bound . The first player then prepared to receive and strike it on the rebound , and thus the game went on until one of the players failed to strike the ball at his turn before it had bounced twice . A small ball used in this game was struck against the wall with the hand which was protected by a glove . Ball alleys were to be found throughout the country , and the game of fives was played both in the North and the South . William A. Duer speaks of Walker 's Fives Alley near the corner of Murray Street in New York City . " There indeed , " he says , " my school fellows and I attended occa- // sionally as spectators merely , but continued nevertheless to take some lessons in the game when our elders had withdrawn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the interior part of the state of South Carolina.3o Numbers of young men frequented these places of sport . This game was of such interest that sometimes match games were played with parties from other communities , and oftentimes at these matches considerable sums of money were staked on the results . Stephen D. Miller , governor of the state of South Carolina ( 1828-1830 ) , was one of the best players at the game . ' Travelers spoke of the sport . Henry C. Knight in 1824 made the following comment : " At some cross roads or smooth shaven-green , you may see a wooden wall , high and broad as the side of a church , erected for men to play ball against . " 32 According to Francis Taylor of Orange County Virginia , neighbor and cousin of James Madison , fives was an outstanding game in that state , and was played at every convenient place , especially the courthouse . September 29 , 1788 , he recorded in his diary : " Went with G. Taylor to Hans ford . Some five playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Went to the courthouse in the evening . Some five playing . " June 16 , 1798 , he further recorded : " Went with J. Taylor to Doolin . There was considerable company playing at fives . I staid till sunset and it was dark when I got home . " 33 Fives was accepted as a game which not only afforded pleasure and exercise to the participants , but was also harmless to morals . The sport was played during the day , which caused it to find favor with the most scrupulous people . A diversion thus ending with the setting sun could never be carried to an excess . Fives , therefore , was an amusement which the fashionable practiced and which the good were pleased to encourage.34 // Rackets , a popular game of ball , was played in the United States at this period of history . The game was very similar to fives except a bat was used in serving instead of the hand . There were two to four players in the game of rackets and as in fives the ball was struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same wall , each player endeavoring to strike the ball so that his opponent might not be able to return it . Records do not show just when rackets was first played in the United States , but it certainly was practiced immediately after the Revolution . In 1803 the sport evidently was played in Philadelphia , for at that date a racket court at the corner of Fourth and Wood Streets was advertised for rent.35 Perhaps the oldest racket court in New York was built in 1800 at the corner of Allen and Hester Streets by James Knox.36 Knox upon returning to New York after the American Revolution , established a racket club and afterwards built this court . The Allen Street Court , which was open and double , was built of brick and faced with brown stone . None but members were admitted to the court and its members were of the most aristocratic families of the city.37 James Knox died in 1810 , and his son Robert succeeded him , conducting the court until his death in 1826 . Then Peter Hurly took charge , keeping it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club during these years were Charles Livingston , Henry Suydam , and Philip Hone.38 The butchers of the city had courts and played match games with others from different sections of the town . Some were very adept at the sport . A match game between William Harrington , the champion of the butchers , and Benjamin R. Theall of the Broadway court was played in 1833 . The condition of the match was that Harrington should carry a man by the name of George Masonry , weighing one // hundred and seventy-five pounds , on his back during the contest . Even with the heavy weight , Harrington won the game with ease . " The sport of rackets was considered the most exciting ball game played and accepted as useful because it educated the eye , the hand , and the whole body . The game required skill and activity in the players who had to be constantly on the move . Standing still was entirely out of the question . Two or three games at rackets was believed to improve the health and invigorate the limbs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played , was strictly English in origin and can be traced back to the beginning of the fourteenth century when it was known to have been played in England . In this country the sport was often practiced at the close of trainings , raisings , shooting matches and on election days.40 This game was not restricted to any particular number . As few as two could play , and ordinarily the maximum number did not exceed six or eight on a side . It was played with a wooden trap by means of which a ball of hardwood about the size of a walnut was thrown into the air when it was struck by a player with a bat about four feet in length . In preparation for the game two boundary lines were drawn at a given distance from the trap , between which it was necessary for the ball to pass when it was struck by the batsman . The striker was out if he struck the ball into the air and it was caught by one of the other players before it fell to the ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonishing distance . During this period a game of ball bearing the title of " shinny " was played . In some of the states it was known by the name of " hockey " and " bandy . " Varieties of the sport were played all over the United States . Winter skating parties often practiced the game in the form of " hurly . " Shinny was a favorite college sport and was played until football became a recognized sport in the ' forties and baseball iii the ' fifties . // In this game two parties provided themselves each individually with stick , one of whose ends was crooked . The game in some sections was played with lignumvitae sticks with turned up balls at the end.41 Across a long space , at each end of which was a narrow opening , the parties contended to drive a ball of usually two or three inches in diameter through the gate . The sport often became intensely exciting . Opposing parties according to rules were not allowed to place themselves otherwise than face to face . Sometimes it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to get the ball in position to be worked with more ease upon the desired directions , and the temptation was to get upon the opposite side and strike with the enemy . But the cry of " shinny on your own side " stopped such movement . The sport was so violent and produced such physical injuries that it was discouraged . The game was prohibited at Princeton in 1787 , but the prohibition soon became a dead letter for it remained a campus sport for over half century.42 In some of the North Carolina schools one of the rules in 1821 was : " No playing bandy . " If any student dared to violate this rule the penalty was ten lashes.43 Ball playing would not be complete without mentioning the game of battledore and shuttlecock which was practiced by some grown people . This recreation , lasting during the spring season , required continual but gentle action . The sport was played by two persons who with battledores struck the shuttlecocks to and fro between them without allowing the ball to fall to the ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some sort of skin stretched across a wooden frame , while the shuttlecocks were made of balls of light material like cork with trimmed feathers arranged around the top and often were spoken of as " birds . " Battledores and shuttlecocks were imported from England and sold into the United States to the participants of the // sport . January 10 , 1824 , the Washington National Intelligencer carried the following advertisement : The subscriber has just received imported direct from London to his order a few dozen pair of battledores and shuttlecocks , No. 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , from the manufacturer , Durley , said to be the only man in England who understands the manner of preparing the skin to cover the battledore so that it will not yield to the changes of weather , but remains inflexible till worn out by use . The birds are far superior in size and beauty to the ordinary kind . CHAPTER V CONTESTS OF SKILL AND STRENGTH The American people were fond of participating in sports requiring strength and skill . Throwing the ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often weighty and cumbersome furnished a peculiar pleasure ; in fact , any sport for strong , brawny muscles was enjoyed , and spectators were not necessary for success . There was something satisfying to the individual player on completing successfully a sport in which obstacles had to be overcome alone and in which there was no defensive play , no attacking of an enemy 's position . QUOITS Throwing quoits has been a popular game in America since the arrival of the first colonists . It attracted many players on account of its simplicity and inexpensiveness . Besides , the sport was accepted as an honest , innocent and wholesome recreation which furnished pleasant hours for relaxation and social companionship . The game required both strength and skill . Naturally a certain amount of strength was required to hurl a two-pound ring or stone fifty-five or sixty feet . To " ring the meg " repeatedly called for skill , and a keen eye . To become skilful at the game practice was necessary , but with the popularity of the sport , practice was easily obtained and good quoit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground from eighteen to twenty yards in length , at each end of which a pin called a " meg " was fastened in the ground to serve for a mark . The quoits were ring-shaped , sometimes of iron , but often flat stones were used . The object of the game was to throw the quoit as near the meg as possible . Players divided into two sides , and each player had two quoits which he threw in succession . The thrown quoit , if surrounding the meg or hob counted 78 // two , and the one nearest the ring counted one . The side which gained eleven points won the game . Young and old , rich and poor enjoyed this amusement . It was so simple that suitable grounds could be found in almost every place where the people congregated . At the close of trainings , log rollings and raisings , quoits were in vogue as a game of skill and strength among the robust men who delighted in testing their prowess not only at heavy work , but also in sports . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Americans , all the moments that could be spared from court sessions were spent in playing quoits and other games along with horse racing and betting . ' Planters turned from political discussions at country stores and cross roads to relax themselves at the game of " coit , " while men and boys of the working class did the same . ' Proprietors of inns and taverns made their quarters more attractive by offering to them good quoit grounds where the game could be played in a pleasant and successful manner.3 College boys participated in the sport . At Washington College in Virginia , and at Princeton , for example , it was one of the favorite amusements.4 From Philadelphia southward quoit clubs were organized in every town of importance . The most outstanding clubs were those in Philadelphia , Baltimore , Washington , Richmond and Savannah , generally composed of the leading men who met regularly to enjoy social companionship . These organizations were social and often were called the " Social Quoit Club . " 5 Each had its own rules and regulations . Perhaps the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Philadelphia Club . The following are the most interesting : The number of members shall be limited to twenty ; to be- // come a member , a gentleman must be proposed at a meeting . Two black balls shall exclude a candidate , and no ballot shall take place unless there be at least thirteen members present . The meeting shall take place on the first Saturday in May . No member shall accept an invitation on club day . No invitation to be given to others than strangers , excepting by the president of the club , who shall have the liberty of inviting two friends . The President of the day , or some other member of the club or proxy for him shall attend the giving out of wine , porter , etc . A secretary and treasurer shall be appointed , the latter the oldest member , and the former the youngest member of the club . The duty of the secretary shall be to purchase the wine and to give his orders upon the treasurer for the amount . On the first meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $25.00 , and be liable to be called upon for his proportion of any additional expense . No hot dishes to be allowed on any account , except vegetables . The penalty for infringing the rule shall be one dozen bottles of Maderia for the use of the club. ? From the above it is evident that the club was exclusive and that much attention was given to drinks , which was the most important part of the refreshments . The members of the Richmond Quoit Club drank the favorite beverage of the Virginians ? mint julep , toddy and punch in the place of wine. ? By the constitution of this club any talk on the subject of politics was forbidden . The meeting of the club was solely for recreation and social relaxation . The famous Richmond Quoit Club was organized in 1788 and consisted of thirty members . They met once a fortnight from May until October near Buchanan 's Spring about a mile from the city . The club consisted of judges , lawyers , doctors and merchants . The governor of the state when he entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sr. , even when an old man participated in the pitching of quoits , $ and the name of John Marshall has ever // been associated with the well known quoit club . He probably more than any other contributed to the pleasantness of the club meetings . He was punctual in attendance and was one of the most skilful in throwing the quoit . The Richmond Quoit Club impressed strangers and foreigners with the good humor and social enjoyment that prevailed . On the club day , dinner consisting of meats , fish , barbecued pig , vegetables , melon , fruits , punch , toddy and mint julep , was served on tables protected by an open shed in the shade of the oak trees.9 In Savannah where quoit playing was popular even among the leading men , the game was played much later in the year than other places . No doubt , due to the mild climate which permitted outdoor sports practically throughout the year , December called no halt in the sport . During this month the club met as usual , electing officers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Fair Lawn on the outskirts of the city where the game was played . At these grounds where the people gathered for their favorite sport , not only social intercourse and healthful relaxation took place , but often difficulties arose leading to serious results . Duels which were prevalent at this period , particularly in the South , sometimes had their origin on the quoit grounds . Some at Savannah , at least , occurred from trouble arising at Fair Lawn . " Quoit grounds , however , were no more scenes of controversy than other places where people met . Disturbances and rows were common occurrences . NINE PINS , SKITTLES AND BOWLS With quoit pitching often went the games of nine pins , skittles and bowls . These were played to a certain extent in various sections of the country , but especially in the northern . They were common around taverns and inns for the convenience of guests . ' 2 People often visited places of this // nature for an hour or two for the purpose of playing nine pins , skittles or other desirable sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " Many persons come down here ( Marblehead ) for an hour or two and return the same evening , a game of nine pins and a dinner of fish being the inducement . " 13 Nine pins and skittles were English games . Both sports usually were played out doors , and were very similar in other respects , differing only in the number of skittles or pins . When as many as nine pins were used , the game was called " nine pins . " In these two games the players stood at a distance , usually twenty-one feet away , and cast large wooden balls at the pins which were bottle shaped pieces of wood arranged in a square and one angle of the square turned towards the players . The contest was to beat them all down in the fewest strokes . Nine pins was very popular in Albany , New York , and was played so much that the council of the city in 1829 discussed the feasibility of banishing the sport to the suburbs for the reason , among others , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no minor should be permitted to roll nine pins in the city and that the amusement should be prohibited after eight o'clock in the evening.14 Bowls , which was often called ten pins at this period , was , probably , a modification of skittles and nine pins . By 1830 bowling clubs were organized in some of the cities where the game was regularly played.15 In this sport ten pins were used , and set up in the form of a triangle with the apex towards the bowler , who stood at a distance from sixty to seventy feet away and rolled wooden balls at the pins . The object was , as in skittles and nine pins , to knock as many pins as possible with the fewest throws . DOLLAR PITCHING Another game of skill commonly played at country stores or some place where liquor was sold , was the pitching of // dollars . This amusement was prevalent among the poor whites of the South . ' ? The game usually was played by four people who with two silver dollars each pitched them in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were from fifteen to twenty feet apart , and two antagonists stood at each of the two holes , each player endeavoring to put his dollar in the hole . To pitch the dollar without erring required skill and practice , and some who developed success had wide fame . LONG BULLETS Probably no sport of strength and skill reached a greater popularity than that of throwing the bullet . To throw successfully this heavy ball necessitated a strong hand guided by a cunning eye . Long bullets was played with a large iron ball , usually weighing several pounds , slung in a strap or thrown . There were two goals and two sets of players . The work of those near one goal was to prevent the ball rolled in their direction from passing their goal , the winning side being that one which could succeed in rolling the ball with enough force to pass the adversary 's line , and scored the greatest distance in doing so.17 Andrew Jackson was an expert in throwing the long bullet . This sport took place on the streets , highways and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the express purpose.18 There was not a section of the country where it was not practiced by a certain class of people unless it was prohibited by law.13 Long bullets was practiced to such an extent on the highways and near towns as to endanger the safety of people traveling about . ( ambling was a strong feature of the game and soon became one of the objectionable phases . In some parts of Virginia the assembly was called upon to stamp out the amusement for this reason along with its being dangerous to general // rambled about shooting at whatever came into view such as bushes , trees , etc . The men of Philadelphia , however , took the lead in organizing the devotees into a club . SWIMMING The art of swimming is probably as old as humanity itself . The Americans , like other people , engaged in it even though there was prejudice in many places against such " washing . " The early bath house in this country was a hole in some pond , creek or river , where the boys spent many hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport until the nineteenth century when some people began to realize the healthful value of bathing . As more people indulged in bathing , more began to learn to swim ; instructions were given out , explaining how to acquire the art , and reasons for every one having a knowledge of the useful and healthful recreation . The person whose influence gave the greatest impetus to swimming throughout this period and later was Benjamin Franklin . His treatise on the art appeared in periodicals even before 1790 , and after that date it was published in different papers and magazines . The fact that Franklin at one time had been a teacher of swimming together with his treatise added dignity to the sport . In his argument of it he said : " The exercise of swimming is one of the most healthful and agreeable in the world . After having swum for an hour or two in the evening one sleeps cool the whole night even during the most ardent heat of summer . Perhaps , the pores being cleansed , the insensible perspiration increases and occasions this coolness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stopping a diarrhoea and even of producing a constipation. " 29 His useful hints for learning to swim were accepted as practical and adequate , and even as late as 1839 no other method was considered so safe and efficacious as his.3 ? This method as stated by him was : " Choose a place // where the water deepens gradually , walk coolly into it , till it is up to your breast , then turn round your face to the shore , and throw an egg into the water between you and the shore ; it will sink to the bottom , and be easily seen there as your water is clear . It must lie in the water so deep that you can not reach it to take it up , but by diving . To encourage yourself in order to do this , reflect that your progress will be from deeper to shallower water , and at any time you may be bringing your legs under you , and standing on the bottom raise your head far above the water . Then plunge under it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and endeavoring by the action of your hands and feet against the water to get forward till within reach of it . In this attempt you will find that the water brings you up against your inclinations , that you can not , but by active force , get down to the egg . Thus you feel the power of the water to support you , and learn to confide in that power , while you endeavor to overcome it and reach the egg . It teaches you the manner of acting on the water with your feet and hands , which action is afterwards used in swimming to support your head higher above the water or to go forward through it . " 31 Throughout the country baths were established where people could bathe or swim . Those who did not swim often took books with them to read while they enjoyed the pleasure and luxury of one of the popular floating baths.32 They were established in every city of any importance such as Boston , Salem , Hartford , New York , Philadelphia , Washington , Richmond , Charleston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover four thousand feet , and were divided into apartments , one for the men and one for the women ; these in turn were partitioned into compartments , some of which were designed for those who swam , or wanted to learn the art ; others were for those who desired to enjoy only the luxury and pleasure of either lying or sitting in a bath . Each room had a shower bath and attendants who // looked after the comfort , protection and pleasure of the bathers and swimmers.33 Admittance fee usually was twelve and one-half cents for each bath or ten tickets for one dollar . A floating bath at the foot of Jay Street in New York City was described by the editor of the New York Evening Post : " The building is an octagon of seventy feet in diameter , with a plank floor supported by logs so as to sink the center bath four feet below the surface of the water , but in the private baths the water may be reduced to three or even two feet so as to be perfectly safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as always to be supplied with ocean and pure water , and rises and falls with the tide . " 34 At public bath houses , cork waistcoats were provided for beginners in order that they might practice with both safety and effect.35 Patrons were accommodated with refreshments of various kinds such as rum , wine , gin , punch , coffee , Spanish " segars , " cordials and liquors , and in addition to the refreshments some of the proprietors furnished entertainments and exercises to suit the taste of the people . Bowling alleys , skittles and nine pins were provided.36 Sea bathing was also practiced , and already many people went to summer resorts where swimming was one of the healthful and delightful recreations . Rockaway Beach was an important place and so was Cape May . At the last named place , board and lodging could be obtained for seven dollars per week , but each visitor had to provide his own towels for bathing.37 At Old Point Comfort sea bathing was popular , and a foot path was provided leading from the hotel to the beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand.38 Long Branch , New Jersey , was the great // sea bathing place for the people of New York City and Philadelphia , valued also for its ocean breeze . Saratoga Springs and Ballston Springs in New York were fashionable inland resorts where therapeutic bathing had also a slight tinge of sport.3 ? Further south were such places as Warm Springs , and White Sulphur Springs , Virginia.4 ? Rufus King when senator from New York was accustomed to visiting the former place where he enjoyed the excellent bathing and swimming . In the interior sections of the country swimmers were accommodated by springs which were converted into bathing quarters . Bath houses were built , one for the men and one for the women . Usually the bath house was a shanty built where the water bubbled up and this constituted the only shelter for the bathers . Travelers in America often spoke of these delightful cool baths and of their bathing once or twice each day in the pure spring water.41 Just what kind of a swimming costume was worn at this time is hard to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suits . From certain prohibitions and many complaints concerning swimming it is easy to believe that some of the swimmers wore even less in general than today . One of the laws of Yale College in 1822 forbade any student from undressing himself for swimming in any place exposed to public view.42 Worcester , Massachusetts , in 1829 enacted a law prohibiting any person from exposing himself in swimming or bathing one hour before sunrise or one hour after sundown in any part of the Blackstone Canal within the limits of said town , or in view of a dwelling house or street or highway.43 Citizens of the Eleventh Ward of the city of New York complained of the habit of boys and young men stripping themselves in open day and bathing in the waters // of the East river , thereby exposing themselves to the walks of gentlemen and ladies.44 Benjamin Franklin said nothing about swimming costumes , but J. Frost , an Englishman who wrote a book called , " The Art of Swimming , " published in New York in 1818 , advocated a thin calico suit which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could be conveyed in a handkerchief to the bathing place . Frost says : " If necessary decency was attended to by using bathing suits , there would not be seen such frequent prohibitions of swimming on the banks of the rivers . " 45 It is quite probable that ordinary old clothes were used in swimming when the bather thought clothing necessary . It is interesting to know the devices used to aid the young swimmer to master the art . Franklin speaks of waistcoats which were made of double sail cloth with small pieces of cork quilted in between them . Bladders and corks were used by some people , but Franklin doubted if they would be of any real service save supporting the body while learning the stroke . Frost recommended beginners to procure a thin board fifteen inches long , three inches broad and threeeighths of an inch in thickness . A few holes were to be bored in it near each end through which a needle was to pass . Then the two pieces of cork , each five inches long , and at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastened across the board at each end on the same side . The cork side of the instrument was to be placed on the stomach and breast , the top cork coming up to the collar bone and the bottom one reaching to the bottom of the stomach . Another piece of cork about ten or eleven inches in length , two or three inches in width and as many in thickness were to be placed on the small of the back . The cork was bound on with a broad bandage which passed through the middle of the back cork and brought round the waist , and tied tightly over the stomach board . These devices were thought to afford buoyancy and to preserve the proper attitude of the // swimmer.46 When a piece of cork could not be obtained some bottle corks inclosed in a small net was thought to answer the purpose . Bloor probably had the most modern plan for the instruction of the beginner in learning to swim . He recommended as an useful assistant a large air filled gut from the bullock , called by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have found three of these altogether amounting to about four feet long , tied around a boy of nine years old , quite sufficient to support him on water . From this , I suppose , as many as measures ten feet will be sufficient for an adult . They are to be tied . around the body beginning close under the arms , with the first and the next close to it , and soon with the rest , having one around the neck . If they are long enough to go quite around the body , all the better ; in which case a person may tie them in front and can do it himself , and may not be amiss to prevent them slipping downwards to fasten a string to each from the neck . The best way to fill them is when they are just taken out of the beast and cleaned . Tie them around anything of the shape of a man 's body and blow them not very tight , as they will be stronger ; and should not a right curve be obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 47 Bloor thought the guts far preferable to corks and bladders because they did not hinder the spreading of the arms . It was not until 1827 that a swimming school was established in America , though before that time some thought that swimming should be supervised by an instructor of swimming . It was observed that many boys and adults were in the habit of bathing in the sea in such a manner as to render the practice highly injurious to health . Many believed that the assignment of certain times and places for public bathing , and a prohibition of the practice at all other hours would secure in a great measure good effects of bathing properly . These provisions if properly carried out were to // be under the eye of a teacher of swimming , and no one not under his tuition was to be permitted to remain in the water more than two or three minutes , and not to bathe except in very warm weather , oftener than once in two days . ' $ When Francis Lieber , the famous German-American , arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the model of the Jahn system practiced in many German cities . Lieber , who was an university trained man and later a noted author and distinguished professor of political science , had a great influence in making swimming universally recognized as an important and respectable sport when conducted in the proper manner . The swimming school was a novelty in Boston , but it was a phenomenal success . Men and boys flocked to the school to receive instruction in the exercise which they were all fond . In September 1827 , President John Quincy Adams , then a man sixty-one years old , visited Lieber 's school , and much to Lieber 's surprise showed himself an experienced swimmer . Several times he sprang headlong into the water from a spring board six feet high . He praised the school and expressed the wish that there were many establishments of the kind in the country , which would greatly tend to promote public health.49 Audubon , the ornithologist , visited the school in 1832 , swam with Lieber , and expressed his delight at finding such an establishment.50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established where gymnasiums were already organized . Parents agreed that it was better to send boys to a swimming school where precautions were taken for their safety than to let them run to the rivers with crowds of other boys . Also , provisions were made for undressing and dressing , which they thought , had a moral value . In the South where no swimming schools were established during this period , Lieber 's swimming school of Boston was looked upon favorably . The Carolina Sentinel in 1827 ex- // pressed a desire for such an establishment in the city of Newbern . It said : " Dr. Lieber , a German at Boston , is enabled in a few lessons to teach any person to swim . The unspeakable importance ( to say nothing of the pleasure ) of being able to sustain one 's self in the water , would , it is believed , find pupils in abundance for any competent person who would establish a school in our city . A knowledge of swimming ought to be considered as indispensable a branch of the physical education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fire arms . " 51 At this date there certainly were no long distance swimmers to compare with those of today . There was no one who boasted of swimming the English Channel or similar distances , but there were swimmers in America who were performing wonderful feats . In New York , May , 1825 , a young man eighteen years of age swam across the Hudson River from Paulus Hook to Castle Garden . When advertised in the papers that such a performance would take place , it was whispered that it was a hoax and nothing more would be heard of it , but at the appointed time the boy started , accomplishing the feat in about an hour and a half , notwithstanding the tide that carried him considerably down the river . On approaching Castle Garden , he received an American flag while in the water , and waved it several times with each hand as a number of spectators from the boats and garden shouted to him . He then received a bottle of grog and drank part of it . During all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it was reported , exhibited to the spectators a frame which rivaled the Farnese Hercules for sinew , muscles and figure . " Every year after the establishment of Lieber 's swimming school some members of the school went on a swimming excursion to test their ability to swim long distances . In July , 1830 , two boats took the men up to Cambridge where they started from the college baths , one boat leading and the // other in the rear . The wind was against the tide , and thus produced waves which splashed against the faces of the swimmers . Nevertheless , they continued their swimming , performing the expedition from the baths to the swimming school , a distance of four miles within one hour and twenty minutes.53 This was considered a phenomenal performance , many newspapers giving an account of the wonderful swimmers of Lieber 's school . Swimming became more popular as time passed . It was practiced in many colleges and schools and was a favorite sport at Harvard . The Charles River was the place of this activity . The sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal security , promoting cleanliness , and consequently health . Dr. Charles Caldwell thought swimming a useful exercise when properly practiced because it gave vigor to the muscles and contributed to health by promoting cleanliness.54 John Quincy Adams said he had tried all kinds of gymnastic exercises , but never found greater refreshment after continuous mental exertion than swimming.55 Adams , while President , often was known to slip away from his presidential duties and take a plunge into the Potomac , refreshing himself from the heavy responsibilities attached to his office.66 SKATING The people in the northern parts of the United States had an advantage over the other sections of the country in enjoying sports of a cold climate , especially skating in which all classes of people participated . It was early practiced in the United States , but the people of this country never engaged in it as much as the Dutch , nor were there as elegant skaters as in Scotland . There were spectators of this sport who were entertained with the graceful and skilful skating , but it was the partici- // pants who derived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all stations of life found the sport fascinating . Skating enabled the well bred man to show his grace of bearing and movement , which was highly prized . The fact that the sport cost little money made it extremely popular . " This animating , exhilarating sport " freed the minds of the participants from all worries and cares , while the body was invigorated and strengthened . The sport was a favorite with the college boys , and was practiced even when there were prohibitions against it . In 1820 skating on deep water was forbidden at Harvard without permission from the president , or one of the trustees or professors under the penalty of fifty cents . " This prohibition along with others became a dead letter . Oliver Wendell Holmes , while at Harvard in 1825 , wrote to a friend saying that he did not have time to attend the grace of style of his letter , for he had snatched a hasty moment from the time when he expected to be skating.68 Of the communities participating in the sport , Philadelphia and New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country in producing elegant skaters . In these cities there was scarcely a winter in which skating was not practiced by a large portion of their population for weeks together . The Delaware river , on which the ice often became two feet thick and more , was the chief skating place for the former city . " a In New York the " Kolck , " a fresh water pond , was in the winter the resort for hundreds of men and boys . No scene was more picturesque and interesting on a fine clear morning , we are assured , than the thick ribbed ice , covered with many varieties of skaters dressed in all colors while they performed their various evolutions , darting here and yonder , up and down , now sweeping gracefully in alternate curves , then // turning at sharp angles . " 0 During these many movements on the ice , sometimes a ball was pursued by the crowds after it had been struck by a hurly far over their heads . Philadelphia was known for its famous skaters even before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , and after the war , he entertained in London many admirers of the sport by his performing what was called the " Philadelphia Salute . " Other famous skaters of Philadelphia were William Thorpe , Doctor Foulke , Governor Mifflin , Charles Wilson Peale and George Hegel . Hegel was the most conspicuous , for he dressed in a red coat and buckskin tights , and was unusually graceful and clever at figure skating.su Peale was known as a skater for using a remarkable pair of " gutter skates " curved backwards with which he moved leisurely about in curved lines . Dr. Foulke , one of the most noted surgeons of the day , was particularly skilful skating " High Dutch " and being able to cut the letters of his own at one flourish.62 In the forward movement of the " High Dutch " the swinging foot was brought down nearly parallel with the other when about to receive the weight of the body , and at the same time the body inclined a little to the front , making an angle of about seventy degrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a swinging arm always acted as the balance to the body , and by it a perfect command of necessary motions was acquired . This arm was due to move in a line with the body kept straight . In a forward circular , and sweeping movement , the body was kept as erect as possible , and stooping of the neck , head and shoulders avoided . Considering the number of people who indulged in this sport accidents upon the ice was not as many as one might expect . On large sheets of water where a number of persons assembled to skate , a long pole or ladder was provided by the local Humane Society , which , when any one // broke the ice , was instantly passed over the opening from side to side by way of rescue.83 Skates of this period were very clumsy affairs . Some of them were manufactured in America , but the majority were imported from Holland . They could be purchased for the small amount of twenty-five cents in some places.84 After an improvement of the American skate in 1830 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market . Throughout this period , however , the old fashioned skate was most commonly used . These were usually known by the name of " gutters , " " dumps " and " rockers . " All had wooden foot rests instead of iron as of late years , and the iron runner was no longer than the foot . The skates were fastened on by straps from the toes to the heel , which often resulted in considerable cramping of the foot . Besides the discomfort of the skates , accidents sometimes happened as a result of their general weakness . The iron-soled skate was used in the family of Charles Wilson Peale as early as 1800 , but not generally used until the ' thirties.65 In 1830 when the change began , the foot piece was a thin plate of that metal and the runners were fastened to it by passing several projecting points through holes drilled in the foot piece and riveting them , forming a strong immovable union , a point in which the old kind had been very deficient . Instead of these skates being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the straps formed a bracing across the foot with four attachments on each side . The pressure was so equalized as to make it comfortable , and upon taking off these skates after hours , no cramping of the foot was felt . The runners were brought up in front , and being rounded on the edges and highly polished , they gave an attractive appearance . The new skates were esteemed not only as more handsome but as less liable to accidents which in former times happened when two persons hooked // the joints of their skates together . The best improvement consisted in making runners the entire length of the foot . The security of the skate to the heel was perfected in this new kind by a small " ketch " at the extreme end , which with great facility was attached to a screw head that was fixed in the boot heel . CHAPTER VI SLEIGHING Sleighing can not be classified as an outdoor sport of strength and skill , but standing in a class by itself , it certainly was a diversion to which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North of Pennsylvania the pleasure could be indulged in most of the winter , but farther south the snowfall was of such short duration that the most had to be made of every minute . Both sexes indulged freely in this outdoor diversion . The women seemed indifferent to the intensity of the cold . The colder the weather the more they frolicked in their sleighs for miles around . So exciting and delightful was the sport , we are told , that the most delicate female thought an evening drive of ten or twenty miles , even in the coldest weather , conducive to amusement and health . William Priest , as well as other travelers in America , commented on the women 's fondness for sleighing . He said that he had never heard a woman speak of this diversion but with rapture . ' Everybody seemed passionately fond of sleighing , visiting Southerners as well as the natives . Calhoun while attending the Law School at Litchfield , Connecticut , in 1806 indulging in it , wrote : " We have excellent sleighing here . I was out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found it very agreeable . " 2 With the approach of winter old sleighs were got in readiness or new ones were bought , for when the snow fell every horse and every sleigh was in demand , especially in large towns . This was the season of dancing and merriment , and at this time every person who possessed a dollar willingly parted with it to have a sleigh ride.3 Three , four and five dollars an hour was not uncommon to pay for the use of // a big many-seated sleigh . ' Horses were specially trained for the racing of sleighs , and many traveled at a great velocity through the biting air of a cold night . Vehicles of every description were used . Those drawn by two or four horses were called sleighs , while those drawn by one horse received various names according to their form of construction and upon the locality , cutter , pung and others.5 Sleighs in general were open above , and many had cross seats like those of a stage wagon , capable of accommodating eight or ten persons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front . The driver usually stood erect protected by a curved board which rose high to keep out the snow . Some of these sleighs were elegant and handsomely covered within by rich furry skins of bear and buffalo.6 Oftentimes they were painted in bright colors , some gilt and gayly decorated , while the doors and windows , if the sleigh was closed , were glazed. ? The harness of the horses used with these vehicles were considered the most elegant ? the sort to harmonize with the beautiful sleighs . The runners , shod with iron ? like a pair of large skates , skimmed along with ease . Since there was no rattling of wheels to warn the pedestrians of their approach , the horses , as provided by law , carried bells around their necks and bodies and also at their ears . Moreover , these bells were an affair of ornament to delight the eye and ears , the bells being nicely assorted to harmonize and attached to handsome leather belts.8 The bells keeping up a perpetual jingling , furnished music to the horses who traveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young people , boys and girls wrapped in warm flannels , in sleighs heated with hot sand bags and foot stoves , headed for the place of entertainment , // usually a tavern or inn ten or twenty miles distant , to par  - -  take of the luxuries of boiled chicken , foaming flip and hot wine.9 Taverns were never closed to the reception of these parties of young men and women who rode for miles around visiting them for drinks and a dance . In the larger towns in order to have a sleighing frolic in style , it was necessary to provide a fiddler , who was placed at the head of the sleigh and , if it were not too cold , played all the way while the company sang . Oftentimes sleighs were near together on the road , and as they passed one another , they exchanged shouts and greetings or perchance bandied snow balls . After the party had sung , eaten , drunk , danced and frolicked until a rather late hour , the sleighs were put in readiness and in high spirits they drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lonely and silent woods often were filled with music at the quiet hour of midnight by the swiftly passing sleigh bells . Adam Hodgson in 1821 describes New York during the sleighing season . He says : " Broadway exhibits the gayest scene you can conceive . Painted sleighs with scarlet cloth and buffalo skins are dashing along in all directions at a prodigious speed ; some with two horses abreast , some harnessed as tandems and others with four in hand . Everybody seems to make the most of the snow while it lasts , and night does Aot put an end to its festivity . The horses have a string of bells around their necks , and in these fine moon light nights I hear them dashing away long after midnight . " 10 During these sleighing excursions men and women mingled freely and , doubtless , they were strong factors in promoting early marriages , for many love affairs were said to have originated then . Apparently " sleighers " were the happiest creatures in the world and many songs were sung about them . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory to roll , Whilst others in chariots expand the whole soul , // To bestride prancing horses full many may please , But the pleasures of sleighing are greater than these . Musidora , Miss Mira and all the gay throng In exchange for a sleigh will give you a song ; They will leave a dear ball , concert or play And vow no music is as sweet as a sleigh . Then strike a bold stroke , gain their hearts while you can ; The greater gallant , the more favorite man , ' T is not whining nor pining that carries the day ; So away with such nonsense and out with the sleigh.11 Even though sleighing was popular , there were voices heard in opposition to the amusement . The objection was mostly from the standpoint of economy and health . Some thought the money spent for the use of a sleigh would do an infinite deal of good in relieving and comforting the poor widows , the orphans , the sick and distressed who were pining away in misery for the want of food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the development of consumption which of late years had made such havoc among the people " John Duncan , a traveler , in 1818 , stated : " Riding in an open carriage in a frosty night is exceedingly benumbing , and I fear that this amusement is one of the causes of the pulmonary complaints which abound so much in New York . " 13 From the standpoint of morals , few comments were made . In 1816 reflections were cast on the amusement by an unknown correspondent of the Daily National Intelligencer . This writer questioned the wisdom of young women going on sleighing parties , implying that women who did were not of the highest moral type . This correspondent was immediately answered by verses written by an unknown hand who signed the name " Hesper , " vindicating the virtue of sleigh rides . He wrote : // All that is stuff ? I know it well , A girl of virtue and true worth Need never dread the sleighman 's bell She 's armed against all the power of earth . And virtue that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chilling And can not keep , tho in a sleigh , I would not give for it a shilling.14 PART II SPECTATORS ' SPORTS A large group of sports at this period , as at every other , may be classified as spectators ' . The sports of horse racing , cockfighting , animal baiting and boxing were essentially of that type . Foot racing , boat racing and wrestling were more participants ' sports in the beginning than spectators ' . Men and boys enjoyed trying their skill just for their own pleasure even before they drew crowds to watch them perform . But as communities grew a popular interest developed ; and such amusements were carried on then more for the benefit of spectators . The onlookers played a vast part in the sports themselves by giving their moral support to and approval of the contest . The spectator took the thrill of the contest through imagination ; he was in fancy a victorious participant . Betting reached its highest at a spectators ' sport . Without money being staked , none of these sports would have created the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that no spectators ' sport ever was free from gambling . Even the loser enjoyed the excitement and suspense and was anxious for the next contest that he might try his chance again . 107 CHAPTER VII HORSE RACING No other spectators ' sport created as much interest and enthusiasm with the masses of people as horse racing . In short , racing ranked second to the universal sport of hunting in the extent to which it was practiced throughout the country . The Americans , true to their English ancestry , had a decided fondness for horse flesh and at an early date took great pride in improving the breed . Although there were good native horses the best were imported from England . In 1798 , there came to Virginia , Diomed , whose offspring became famous on many a race track not only in that state , but in those adjoining . Top Gallant , Wrangler , Peacemaker , Potomac and Truxton long kept the name alive and respected in the sporting world . ' In such esteem was Diomed held that in some places his death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington in 1799.2 To own a champion race horse gave a man as much prestige in his community as to win the Derby in England . Gentlemen highly prized fine bred horses and talked about them as if they were great personages . Everywhere throughout the country horse racing was more or less indulged in . In New England , however , the sport never became popular and there were no race courses in that section that could rival those in other parts of the country . Yet accounts of racing at different periods are recorded . Timothy Dwight in 1808 said horse racing for a long time had been a favorite pursuit in the state of Rhode Island , especially among the Narragansett planters.3 In the same year , Dr. William Bentley of Salem , Massachusetts , recorded in his diary : " Yesterday was a horse race in Lynnfield , much in the southern style . It collected many persons // from Boston , Salem and the vicinity and seems to have been intended as an introduction to such sports in this part of the country . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recollect , and horsemanship is as low in this portion of the state as in any part of the globe in which opportunities for it are so good . " 4 At different intervals , horse racing was conducted at Lynnfield , Medford , Quincy and other places in New England and associations for encouraging the breeding of fine horses were organized . ' In support of these organizations the Columbian Centinel made the following comment : " It is a distinguished honor to our commonwealth that an association has been formed by a large number of its most respectable and public spirited citizens of all political parties for the laudable purpose of improving the breed of horses in the New England States . The necessity of such a society has been urgent for many years , and the want , or rather the neglect of such an institution has been regretted with a fearful anxiety by all classes of men whose families have derived pleasure and elegance from the graceful exercises of the noblest of all animals . " e Many New Englanders who opposed horse racing contended that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , detrimental to good morals . Supporters of the sport in reply to this accusation explained that if the appearance of gaming tables was to prevent public meetings and exhibitions , the celebration of independence , military musters , and even commencement at the universities and the ordination of the clergy would have to be given up , for at all these gamblers appeared. ? The sport of horse racing continued to be a subject for criticism in New England and never did it become popular , even though efforts on the part f the few were made to encourage racing as a means of developing a better breed of horses . // In the Middle States there was horse racing , though not to the extent that distinguished the South and Southwest . Races in these states , indeed , were held at a very early period , as , for example , at Hempstead , Long Island , in 1664 . New York State , the home of the sportsmen who were destined to humble the pride of southern rivals , had been engaging in horse racing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as 1796 Captain Williamson of Bath , New York , encouraged premium races on all his settlements , and desiring to improve the breed of horses he kept a set of beautiful stallions . Some years later each September fairs and races were held on the same day on which great sums of money were staked . " Races were held in the seventeen nineties at the Catskill district and at Poughkeepsie somewhat to the southeast . Even though there were few men of wealth in that section of the country , the bets made on those occasions exceeded the sum of four thousand dollars . The horses were used for no other purpose and their prices ranged from twelve hundred to fifteen hundred dollars . " Races were held at the Harlem Course through the early part of 1800 and they were also held at the Paulus Hook Course , purses ranging from three hundred to five hundred dollars.1 " The greatest horse in the country , Messenger , whose blood was of great import in the trotters , was owned in New York . Even though horse racing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1803 until 1821 , the sport was practiced . When this law was repealed , horse racing began really to flourish there . Race courses were built equal to any in the country in size , convenience and equipment ; it was this year , 1821 , that the Union Course was established.11 The state of Pennsylvania , where horse racing had been practiced before the Revolution , prohibited it in 1810 , due // to its gambling aspect.12 That previous to this time racing was far from being universally approved is shown by the fact that " fifteen hundred mechanics and twelve hundred manufacturers " of Philadelphia signed an address to the grand jury in June , 1802 , in which they declared that the race course was injurious to them , and went on to say : " This English dissipation of horse racing may be agreeable to a few idle landed gentlemen who bestow more care in training their horses than in educating their children , but it is greatly injurious to the mechanical and manufacturing interests , and will tend to our ruin if the nuisance is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be held , however , for several years later , though the sport never became popular in Pennsylvania , nor was it an accepted sport in New Jersey . New York was the only one of the Middle States that gave whole hearted encouragement to the development of fine horses for the turf . As the South began to expand westward , the emigrants carried with them the sport of horse racing as well as other sports and customs . Hardly were the settlements made before the people were testing the speed and bottom of their horses in which they took so much pride . As early as 1787 Water Street in Lexington , Kentucky , was a favorite resort for horsemen when their pastime of racing through the street was interfered with by the troublesome trustees of that rising town . ' ' Palmer in his travels in the West speaks ; of the Kentuckians as good horsemen , saying : " I have seen four or five Kentuckians start to race for a trifling bet , some with saddles and bridles and some with nothing but a. halter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse , whisk out of sight in a few moments . " 15 Horse racing was an affair of all-engrossing interest throughout the West . On public days , indeed on almost every other Saturday , the streets and commons were converted into race paths . A scaf- // fold would be erected on which stood the judges of the races . On grand occasions the plain , within the course and near it , was occupied with booths erected with forked sticks and covered with boughs . There everything was said , done , eaten , sold and drunk . There was Black Jack with his fiddle and his votaries making the dust fly with a four handed reel ; and every fifteen or twenty minutes was a rush to some part to see a " fisticuff . " Among the bustling crowd of jockeys were assembled all classes . Even the judges of the court mingled with the crowd , and sometimes presided at the contest of speed between the ponies of the neighborhood.16 The seat of horse breeding and horse racing was in the old South , dating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved horses and took the greatest pride in producing fine animals that were able to compete not only with the neighboring horses , but also with those of adjoining states . Never did the lovers of the turf have to contend with the state legislators or trustees passing laws prohibiting the sport . On the other hand , it was given the heartiest favor by the outstanding men of the day ? senators , governors , judges and others . There was hardly a town of any note in the South that did not have its jockey club , and in the spring and fall usually the exciting events of the year took place when the races were held . People from miles around attended , enjoying the sport to the greatest extent while betting on their favorite horse as well as satisfying their thirst and social instinct by drinking whisky in good company . The oldest and best known track in the country was the Washington Course near Charleston where the races took place every year in the latter part of February . They began on Wednesday and lasted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great jockey club ball took place . This annual race week was a popular festival shared by every one from the Governor and the ladies in the grand stand to the Negroes who sat on the fence tops , enjoying the sport.17 The // whole country in and around Charleston joined in the sport as the horses came down with their owners from the different plantations . Schools , law courts and shops were closed ; only the sick and infirm stayed at home . In short , Charleston and the surrounding communities were transferred to the race course . The ladies were in their carriages , the gentlemen on their handsomest horses , and the boys on their ponies . The poorer people were in gigs , carts and wagons of every kind , while the Negroes in countless numbers thronged from every direction to the course.18 Many visitors came from other states . Boats at New York destined for Charleston advertised their date of sailing for the accommodation of passengers who wanted to reach that city in time for the annual races.19 The courses on which the races @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many courses were inclosed , afforded much convenience to trainers , comfort to spectators , and a greater facility in preserving order , besides adding considerably to the splendor of the spectacle and to the annual subscription of members . With inclosed courses toll was always collected at the gate and the following was the average assessment for admittance : four wheel carriages one dollar , two wheel carriages fifty cents , persons on horseback twenty-five cents and persons on foot twelve and onehalf cents.20 The money thus collected increased the jockey club purse , making it less difficult to support the races . Within the inclosed race fields was a stand for spectators usually about seventy-five feet front and twenty feet deep , and roofed over , such stands being especially for the ladies in attendance and their escorts and costing twenty-five cents extra . Besides the grand stand for spectators there were , on the well regulated race tracks , judges ' , and weighing stands.21 Stables were erected on the field and these together with fodder and oats were furnished by the proprietor of the // course to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the purpose of selling wines , whisky and rum as well as refreshments of less stimulating sort . Sometimes there were as many as eight or ten booths on one race course and several confectionery shops , renting usually for sixty dollars each per year , which amount went to the funds of the jockey club.23 From these booths the poorer class of people ate after the races were over , while the upper class partook of collations served in the dining house on the course or returned to town for dinner parties in the evening.24 Jockey clubs were formed , officers elected , and regulations drawn up to govern the races conducted . Oftentimes prominent men were president and vice-president of the association . From the jockey club stewards were chosen whose office was to help keep order during the races . These officers could be distinguished on the race course by their rosettes of ribands on their breasts and their top hoots and white corduroys . The subscription to a jockey club often was as much as twenty dollars ; this membership , however , carried with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlined the whole conduct of the contests . The purse varied from a silver plate or a horse saddle to thousands of dollars depending on the wealth of the association and the importance attached to the race . Oftentimes there was a sweepstake purse for two hundred dollars , a proprietor 's purse of three hundred and the jockey club purse a thousand.26 The day previous to the races , horses together with the color of their rider 's dress were entered with the treasurer . The age of each horse was recorded and then the horse weighed to see if he conformed to the regulations.27 Often the race was free to any horse , mare , or gelding living within // the state , but horses not owned by a subscriber of the club frequently paid twenty dollars as entrance fee to participate.28 Not many horses entered a race , for there were few that were capable of the severe test that a race put upon them . The distances run covered one , two , three , and four mile heats , but usually the event was a four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Often the best horse would run twelve miles before he had won , and many times the last heat was run almost as fast as the first . At a race in Charleston in 1826 , the first and second three-mile heats were run in exactly the same time ? five minutes and forty seconds ; the third in five minutes and fifty-five seconds ; and the fourth in five minutes and fifty-four seconds , making the total of twelve miles coursing in twenty-three minutes and twenty-four seconds.29 Very few race meets were run off in a day ; ordinarily , indeed , three days were needed . On each day one race for a designated purse was run and after that event the sport for the day was over . The meets except at Charleston were not at stated periods , but often took place as the result of a challenge of one horseman by another , either through the columns of the newspaper or by private correspondence . After the challenge was accepted and the arrangements were made for the race , the approaching event was advertised for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With such persistent advertising , people far and near made it a point to be in attendance . Hotels and tavern keepers profited by horse races , and oftentimes advertisements in the papers were inserted by some hotel keeper who offered to reserve accommodations for gentlemen with their servants and horses who intended to attend the races.30 Owners with their " stables " from adjoining states frequently were present at the races , each apparently thinking that the reputation of his own community depended upon the results of the races . Some South- // ern turfmen made a tour of states from Virginia to New York , entering their horses in some races , and witnessing the various others . One General Winn of Petersburg , Virginia , in 1823 , saw his horse , Vanity , win the fifteen-hundred dollar purse on the home course ; from thence he proceeded to Washington with his horses to enter the races , and from there to New York for another.3 ' Great excitement prevailed from the moment the horse was brought on the course and the rider , dressed in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top boots , took his seat on his mount . Everyone was wondering whether Flirtilla , Sir Archy , Ariel , or what other would win , for everyone old enough to know anything knew the names of the famous race horses . Sometimes the excitement was beyond control when some particular horse made the post only a head in front of another . A thousand voices could be heard giving support to the various horses they were backing . No sooner was the result proclaimed than instantly " rose from earth to heaven the wild hurrah , " and a simultaneous burst of enthusiasm everywhere . The ladies , we are told , stood up in the grand stand and waved their handkerchiefs.32 Crowds followed and cheered the winning horse as he left the course , while others were rushing about supremely happy to receive the money they had won . Thousands of dollars were lost and won in a moment at one of these races , for people bet then who never bet on other occasions . At practically every race course there were regular gamblers who made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and horses were often put up as a bet , and dollars into the thousands were common stakes . It was alleged that people who could not or did not pay their grocery bills bet money plentifully on the race course . Despite the evils that were attached to the sport of horse racing , the most prominent men of the day gave it encouragement . George Washington during his life time was a // patron of the races as of nearly every other sort of outdoor sports . Henry Clay was fond of horses , and his thoroughbreds became famous the country over . He had a mile track built on his place for exercising his horses . John Quincy Adams during his presidency ever found relief from the throngs of visitors by attending the races near Washington . He recorded in his diary , October 27 , 1826 : " This was the third day of the races and Mrs. Adams was so far recovered as to go upon the grounds . It was a beautiful autumnal day . The races relieved me from many visitors . " 33 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Chief Justice Marshall was honorary member of the jockey club at Fairfield , Virginia.34 Thomas Jefferson gave his enthisiastic support , and James Madison owned an interest in a race horse . Andrew Jackson owned some distinguished racers whose fame spread over the country , and even after he became president , he entered his horses and lost heavily on his wagers.35 During the last years of his presidency , the old chief enjoyed the exercise of his horses on the race course at Washington . It was told by Colonel Peyton that in the spring of 1834 Jackson and Van Buren were present at a race on the course at Washington , and as soon as one of the horses began " kerlaraping " General Jackson fired up and took command . He issued orders to everybody ; to the trainer he said : " Why do n't you break him of those tricks ? I could do it in an hour . " Jackson kept shouting : " Hold him , Jesse . Do n't let him break down the fence ; now bring him up and give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enraged horse to Mr. Van Buren who was almost into the track below the stand , he stormed out : " Get behind me Mr. Van Buren , they will run over you . " Mr. Van Buren obeyed as promptly as the trainer had done a moment before . This was one of the anecdotes current among the stump speakers of Tennessee // in the presidential canvass of 1836 between Van Buren and Judge White to illustrate General Jackson 's too fatherly protection of Van Buren.3s With the legalizing of horse racing in New York State in 1821 , the South began to meet with competition . Races were run between New York and the Southern states on which hung the sporting honor of both sections.37 The first important match between the North and the South was made between Mr. Van Ranst of New York , the owner of American Eclipse , and Colonel Johnson of Virginia , owner of Sir Charles for twenty thousand dollars to be run at Washington , D. C. , in November , 1822 . About ten o'clock in the morning of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when impatience had nearly passed into a mania , it was announced that poor Sir Charles had got lame and would not run the match . So Eclipse walked over the course and his owner received the forfeiture of five thousand dollars.38 Before the hour appointed for the race to begin the field was thronged with spectators of both sexes and from almost every state in the Union . It was estimated that there were fifty thousand people present . The city was so filled with visitors that hotels were unable to accommodate them . In fact , every public house on the road near the grounds the night before was filled to such a degree that many were compelled to lie on the floor or in the stable lofts.39 The interest in the race had been accumulating for many months , heightened by the prestige of Colonel Johnson who was called the " Napoleon of the Turf .

The race was decided to be run on the Union Course on Long Island the last Tuesday of May . Preparations for the approaching contest were immediately made . The whole of the judgment of Virginia in'horse flesh was enlisted to select the best blood and bottom of the state , and several horses were trained and fed with the greatest precision by learned grooms , and watched with more than parental anxiety . Nor was the owner of Eclipse idle , for he employed the best professors in the art of feeding and rubbing clown horses that he could get . The way in which each party managed to improve their horses was kept a great secret.4 ' The interest of the contest increased as the event approached . Several horses passed through Baltimore from Virginia to New York , but no one could tell whether it was to be a horse called Sir Henry or a mare named Betsy Richards . Many would have made a journey of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secret was kept until the moment of starting when Sir Henry was brought to the post in the presence of about a hundred thousand spectators.43 For several days before the race , the stages and steamboats arriving at New York were loaded with anxious passengers , many of whom no doubt had traveled five hundred miles to witness the important contest . It was estimated that not less than twenty thousand strangers were in the city of New York . All the hotels , inns , taverns and boarding houses were jammed with people and on the day of the race the city looked deserted . Carriages of every description formed an unbroken line from the ferry to the race grounds.44 The conditions of the race were four mile heats , the best two in three . The course was a mile in length . When Eclipse and Sir Henry were brought to the stand , the signal for starting was given by the " tap of the drum .

The excitement of the Southerners seemed to rise beyond control , while the Northerners were very much depressed . The erratic John Randolph rejoiced to see the Southern horse apparently winning , besides the intense sectional pride , another reason for his satisfaction was the heavy bet he had staked . It was said he proposed to sail for Europe upon clearing enough money to pay his expenses.45 With the race resumed , Sir Henry kept the lead for more than two miles and a half with Eclipse , ridden by a jockey named Purdy , close on to his heels attempting to pass . At every effort to get ahead , Randolph in a high shrill voice could be heard saying : " You ca n't do it , Mr. Purdy . You ca n't do it . " When Eclipse took the lead , a roar of excitement filled the air . Tens of thousands of dollars were at stake . The rider of Sir Henry was changed , but all in vain . On the third heat , Eclipse took the lead and by dint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The whole race was considered a very hard one . The first heat was run in seven minutes and forty seconds ; the second in seven minutes and forty-nine seconds , and the third heat in eight minutes and twenty-four seconds.46 The victors of the contest were , of course , overjoyed . Purdy mounted on Eclipse was led up to the judges ' stand , the band playing : " See the Conquering Hero Comes . " The Southerners proved good sportsmen , however , and accepted their loss with dignity . It was suggested that the comparative chances of Adams and Jackson at the approaching presidential election should be tested by a vote of that gathering . " Oh , " said Randolph , " if the question of the presidency could be settled by this assembly , there would be no opposition ; Mr. Purdy would go to the White House by acclamation. " 47 After the race a dinner party was given by the New York
