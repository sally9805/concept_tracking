txt The recent discussion of the case of Sergeant-at-Arms Barry called sharp attention to the Senate in a light that is not exactly favorable , but which is easily understandable . The Senate should be the greatest legislative body in the world . Just as the government of the United States exercises more power than any other , so the Senate should be the greatest power in this government . But it is not . It would seem that the Senate has a case of the jitters . Hours are spent in arguing inconsequential subjects and , in the meantime , the most urgent business of the country waits . Tempers are frayed , and accordingly we see such outbreaks as those occasioned by Mr. Barry 's article . I do not agree with him . I can not believe that there are crooks in Congress , but I do not know , as I said on the floor , I am not so sure about demagogues . As I understand the meaning of the word , a demagogue is one who stands for something because he thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what does the Senate do ? Its members theoretically represent no State . In the scheme of government , the ninety-six Senators are elected to represent the interests of the United States as a whole , without regard to section , and no Senator Is expected to take a stand that will benefit his own State if it operates to the disadvantage of a majority of the other States . In practice that is not always the case , as is demonstrated by many of the speeches and votes in the Senate . On the other hand , it is easy to understand that Senators feel they must take certain stands in order to remain in office and serve the country . The Senators , just as other hold- ers of public office , whether in the national government or in State governments , are facing a wholly new condition that none of us can understand . Often the Senate must choose between doing a thing that is obviously for the common good , but is not understandable to the average person or the demagogue who goes about preaching against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with popular approval , but may do a great ' deal of harm . It is no secret that there is no longer any sympathy left for Senators or any other public officials . The public does not like them ; it thinks they are living off of the public in hard times . No wonder foolish things are said and done . But the public itself must take only a small share of the blame . The remainder of the blame for the public attitude toward public officials , and particularly Senators , is on the shoulders of the officials themselves . In campaigns , extravagant promises are made that never can be carried out . They often are made in ignorance , because the officeseekers do not know what they are talking about . I am reminded that every poUtica ! campaign in Kentucky which I ever have witnessed has hinged on two topics , the same as campaigns in all other States  --  better schools and roads and lower taxes . Situation Blamed on Promises . That is a fair example of the political campaigns , and those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is impossible to accomplish both . With schools costing 32 cents of every tax dollar and roads 29 cents , it is impossible to keep spending more and more on schools and roads and to reduce taxes to any appreciable extent . As a result ? primarily of those promises , we have reached a point in this country where , with assets estimated at $350,000,000,000 , the country has an estimated aggregate public and private debt of $200 , - 000,000,000 , a debt so large that it could not be cleared without great reorganization . A reflection of that attitude toward roads and schools and reduced taxes , which are primarily State matters , is found in the Senate , where I am told that some Senators , who , in their public speeches , cry loudest for lower taxes , back schemes that will require more and more borrowing by the government . The Senate , as the court of last resort in legislation , faces the ' task of actually meeting the problem of economy . - This can not be done in the House , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies must ' be made and worked out in our own body The Senate must make its choice between actually cutting down government expenditures , possibly with the sacrifice of much routine , or of continuing the spending policy which , if perpetuated , will lead no one can say where . Sense of Perspective " Lost . " The realization of this is one thing that has given the Senate the jitters ; another reason is that we here in Washington lose our sense of perspective and really do not know what step to take . Then when criticism rains on the heads of Senators they burst out . We have two courses to follow : one would be a gradual overhaul of the whole government machinery and the other would be to take immediate steps that would be popular but might be the worst possible course . There is no doubt that we would be very popular if we set out to abolish some departments , say the Department of Commerce , or if we cut down the expenditures of , say , the Department of Agriculture from $275,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time to save money would be generally - popular , I think . On the other hand , such precipitate action might work the most harm to the public welfare . It would be easier to arrive at some understanding of our task , though , if sectionalises could be forgotten . The Senate should has . body of calm consideration ; not one where every member is ready to jump up on the least provocation and denounce this or that or the other thing ' because it may injure his State .
