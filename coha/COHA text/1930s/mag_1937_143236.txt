On Appomattox Day , April 9 , 1890 , when Benjamin Harrison was the seventh Republican President of the U. S. , two young Chicago lawyers named Robert McMurdy and Lester Coffeen opened a Republican social club in a three-story white stone house facing Lake Michigan . Last week to old Lawyer McMurdy , 77 , and many another stanch Republican member came the news that the Hamilton Club , for four decades one of the most famous political fraternities in the U. S. , was about to close its doors . <P> The Hamilton moved down into the crowded Loop when it was six years old , because Founder McMurdy believed that " it 's easier to run a big thing that people want than a little thing they do n't want . " In 1910 the Hamilton made front-page national news when Roosevelt I declined to attend a banquet in his honor there because one of the other guests was Republican Boss William Lorimer , whom the U. S. Senate sensationally refused to seat on the ground that his election was fraudulent . In 1912 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Chicago Bull Moose Convention , President William Howard Taft laid the cornerstone of the Hamilton 's $1,000,000 16-story clubhouse in the shadow of the First National Bank . <P> At its peak in the 20 's , when both Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge had occasion to sleep in its soft beds , the Hamilton had 3,800 members . But Chicago Republicanism struck hard times two full years before the New Deal , when the late Anton J. Cermak swept clownish Republican Mayor William Hale ( ' ' Big Bill " ) Thompson out of City Hall . Membership dropped from 2,300 in 1930 to less than 1,000 in 1935 . That year , owing $215,000 in back taxes and penalties and $86,666 back rent on its site to the estate of Supreme Court Chief Justice Melville W. Fuller , the Hamilton filed a petition to reorganize under Section 77B of the Federal Bankruptcy Act . Last year Illinois ' onetime Attorney General Oscar Carlstrom. the club 's 43rd president , desperately got its members ' consent to delete the word " Republican " from the charter and open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of crusty Republican diehards huffily resigned . Another last-minute expedient was to lease part of the clubhouse to Chicago 's Interfraternity Council . But last week Democratic Federal Judge William H. Holly ordered the Hamilton to liquidate in favor of the Fuller estate , appointed Banker Fred E. Hummel as receiver . <P> Receiver Hummel granted the Hamilton 's 46 resident members until the end of the month to vacate . Most puzzling problem of Manager B. E. O'Grady was what to do with a stuffed seated elephant , borrowed from the late President Lucius G. Fisher of the defunct Elephant Paper Bag Co. , which has accompanied jubilant Hamilton crowds on their special train to Washington for every Republican inauguration since 1892.
