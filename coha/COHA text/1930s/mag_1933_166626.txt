After hearing arguments by naval officers including famed Lieut. - Commander Rosendahl ; editors including Arthur Brisbane and Joseph Medill Patterson ; heavier-than-air experts including Col. Lindbergh and Brigadier-General William ( " Billy " ) Mitchell , the joint Congressional committee on the Akron disaster last week gave a bill-of-health to the Navy 's airship- program , saw in it " further potential utility to be developed only by experience . " Prime recommendations : <P> A new airship should be built to replace the Akron and a new training ship should also be built . <P> The Los Angeles , the Navy 's only training airship , now in dead storage , should be recommissioned . <P> Lakehurst Naval Air Station , instead of being decommissioned , should be the Navy 's airship training centre . <P> Airships should be assured " continuity of personnel . " Only a highly trained officer who already had commanded a training ship should be given command of a regular airship . ( This was prompted by the Navy 's present routine of sending airship officers to sea ; and by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airship prior to the Akron . On the day the committee 's report was published the Navy Department ordered Lieut. - Commander Herbert V. Wiley , Akron survivor , to sea . ) <P> The Weather Bureau should issue daily four general weather maps instead of two . ( The Committee blamed the Akron crash on " navigation of the ship into storm conditions . " Commander Rosendahl had testified that he was sure Captain McCord could not have had full weather data , otherwise what he did would indicate , unthinkably , ' ' wholesale disregard of information . " )
