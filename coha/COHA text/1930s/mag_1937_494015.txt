What to Do About Taxes IT HAS been said that the scope of government is bounded on the north by the resources of the state , on the east by the requirements of private consumption and saving , on the west by the wisdom and honesty of public officials and on the south by the efficiency of the tax system . Of these frontiers , it is the tax system that offers the most formidable limitation to the increasing usefulness of the federal government . In the first of this short series of articles an attempt will be made to show that the tax system is doing its job very inadequately ; that this is not due to limitations imposed by the private economy ( including our present depression ) , or the resources of the nation ; and that the difficulties are within the tax system itself . The second and third articles will discuss these difficulties in detail and make recommendations as to how we should deal with them . This will involve an examination of some of our important tax institutions . In addition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program . Should the Budget Be Balanced ? ? The tax system has an important role to play in our present situation . Six months ago it would have been generally agreed that its first and most important obligation was to balance the budget . Whatever emergency justification for deficits there might have been during the preceding years had ceased . Does the same conclusion still hold , now that a new depression in business has arrived ? The answer depends entirely on how it is proposed to bring about a balanced budget . No doubt a drastic reduction in useful governmental expenditure , including unemployment relief , for which the need is increasing , would be bad depression finance . But to balance the budget by increased taxation of the right sort is quite another matter . It can be said emphatically that the depression does not call for a closed season on programs for stricter income and inheritance taxes . Passive acceptance of a tax system which fails to meet its current responsibilities has continued long enough . It is idle to consider a program to retire our public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nevertheless , it may be recalled that the recurring deficits of the last seven years have been justified by many on the ground that " a cyclical budget " was being substituted for an annual one . The cyclical budget calls for a retirement program as soon as we emerge sufficiently from depression . Some people are naturally curious to know when the second phase of the cyclical budget is likely to begin . did to the States. ? When the tax system has balanced the budget and got a retirement program under way , it has only begun to do its duty . Whilethe federal finances have had the spotlight , the states and municipalities have been struggling along with responsibilities several sizes too large for them . The tax resources of the states are very inferior to those of the federal government . There is , of course , the general property tax . The property tax is made up of several widely different elements . As a levy on urban land , it is defensible and there is not much danger of its becoming excessive . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load upon shelter , a necessity of life which would be expensive enough without this extra burden . It seems odd that we should have singled out for especially heavy taxation under the property tax an interest which we now seek to subsidize as " low-cost housing . " As a tax on rural property , this tax has aggravated the difficult agricultural problem of recent years . As a tax on intangible property , it is a failure . At all events , there has been a revolt against the general property tax during the depression , and many jurisdictions have found that there is a bottom to the property-tax barrel . Some states have turned to the net income tax for revenue . Others have found constitutional barriers in this direction . Income taxes are a minor , not to say a negligible , source of revenue in all but a handful of industrial states . In all states , income ( and inheritance ) taxes are limited by the threats of migration which wealth and industry constantly hold over the heads of state legislatures and Governors . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is whispered that the big taxpayers are about to move out on them . The state income tax has not reached the end of its development , but that development is likely to be slow and limited . About half of the states in recent years have adopted the general retail sales tax . This is a regressive tax on the necessities of life . In a country with our resources and our poverty it should not be necessary to resort to such taxes . However , they do produce the required revenue . Education Needs Support ? Meanwhile some of the important functions left in charge of the states have been provided for very inadequately . The Senate Committee on Education and Labor , which held hearings on the Black Federal Aid for Education Bill , submitted the following evidence of diverse educational standards throughout the states : The average length of the school term ranges from six and one-half to nine and one-half months . The ratio of high-school enrolment to total enrolment ranges from 10.6 to 30.9 percent . Illiteracy among the population over ten year of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14.9 percent in the South . Average annual expenditures per pupil on current operating costs range from $24.50 to $137.69 . Average annual salary per teacher ranges from $465 to $2,361 . Value of public-school property per pupil ranges from $62 to $570 . On their face , these facts seem to make a clear cue for federal aid for education , so plainly of national interest . Is the federal tax system equal to this additional load ? If We Had the Money. ? It has long been recognized that the federal government could spend money to exceedingly good advantage on a more extensive program of public housing . Housing is not only a national need of first importance , but it lies in the building industry , which has a strategic position in recovery . Private housing is fatally handicapped because most of the potential market is short of the necessary purchasing power to finance a private building program . The field of public health ( in which there is clearly a national public interest ) has hardly yet been scratched . The social-security program , too , leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where is the money coming from ? " Needs of the Private Economy. ? The limiting factor in federal finance is not a matter of disturbing the private economy . It is argued by some that every addition to the tax load is at the expense of private production , private wealth and the private standard of living . We frequently hear it said that the government spends one-fifth of the national income as though there were a leak in the economy that drained off huge quantities of nourishment and vitality . But the government is part of the economy , not separate from it . A large part of the national income is produced by as well as for government . To produce goods and satisfy wants cooperatively does not mean that less will be produced and consumed . It may be argued that direct taxes tend to reduce inequalities and that the latter are necessary for maximum production . It may be contended that more equal division would mean less to divide . But it is at least equally plausible to maintain that the existing inequalities are a limiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income would involve a better market , which in tarn would make possible the production and enjoyment of larger amounts of goods and services . For many years economists have been concerned lest a shortage of capital arise from fiscal policy . However , nothing in our economic situation , present or in prospect , seems to point toward such a shortage . Taxation and the Depression of 1937 . ? It is said that taxation and the high cost of government are responsille for the current business decline . This is the same " Wolf I Wolf I " that we heard in 1929 . If the cry has any logic at all , it is that business men have hesitated to venture into new undertakings or to expand old ones , because capital ( due to taxa tion ) has been too scarce , and prospects for profit too slim . But the evidence shows that capital has been cheap and abundant , and that profits and rates of profit have made an impressive comeback ( to say the least ) under present tax institutions . Buyers of stocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boom . Yet , when a recession appears , it is laid to the tax system , and many people in Washington and elsewhere , who should know better , take this talk seriously . To argue that the current business decline necessitates reopening all the tax loopholes so laboriously plugged up during the last three years , and returning to the income-tax schedules of the late twenties is nothing more than an attempt to capitalize upon a fear psychology . Does anyone really believe that in return for tax concessions of this sort private business would present the President and Congress with prosperity upon a platter ? There are many theories of business cycles and depressions , but none that justifies the hysterical surrender of sound sources of public revenue at a time when they are most urgently needed . For many months we were told that there was little need to strengthen the tax system , because in due time the recovery of national income would take care of an accumulating deficit . Now that further recovery is not an immediate prospect , the business situation is cited as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the depression . It is a case of neglecting to repair the house roof while the sue is shining and then finding it impossible to do so when it begins to rain . Nobody likes to pay high taxes , and few , if any , enjoy inflicting them upon others . But it is a discipline we will have to get used to . We may as well begin now by resisting the pressure to reduce and weaken the income tax during the present period . Taxpaying Capacity. ? Nor are our people lacking in taxpaying capacity . If nature were the limiting factor in public finance , the United States would have an exceedingly easy time financing government . We are favored by magnificent resources of wheat and cotton land , of iron , coal and oil . Having arrived late in the family of nations , we have no overpopulation problem . However , institutions are far more of a limiting factor than resources . It has been calculated that less than four percent of the people of voting age are paying direct taxes for the support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some 75,000,000 , only 5,500,000 people filed returns this year , and of this number somewhat less than half paid a federal tax . In Great Britain , with lower per-capita incomes , between a quarter and a third of the mature population filed reports for the British income tax , and of this number about 40 percent paid a tax . Of course , the British do not have our large farm population , but even allowing for this fact , the difference is so ? sufficiently striking . In this country , at the present time , a married man with three children pays no federal income tax ( assuming the income to be ' earned income " ) unless his income is over $4,100 . The British citizen with this amount of income and under similar conditions pays $257 in income taxes . Under the federal estates tax , an individual may leave ' an estate of $80,000 ( half of which is insurance ) and pay no tax . The minimum tax in Great Britain would amount to $6,400 . If the British schedule of income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would produce from two to three times as much revenue as we now collect through our federal and state income and inheritance taxes combined . Depression Changes in the Tax Rates. ? It is one of the most striking facts of recent taxation history that during the period from 1932 to the present , when deficits piled on deficits and grave fears were expressed lest inflation drag us into chaos , not only were the taxes on incomes below $10,000 not increased , but in cases where the income is all earned ( e.g. , salary ) the taxes were actually decreased . The following figures show the trend under the three latest revenue acts which modified the rates : It is true that our top rates in the upper brackets are very high ? somewhat higher than the top rates employed in Great Britain and about equal to the rates applied in this country during the War . However , it is one thing to impose these taxes and quite another to make them effective . It would be interesting to compare the effective rate on the " net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nominal rates of the law . This would be one method of presenting quantitatively the importance of loopholes . The Roosevelt administration , during its five years in power , has raised the level of the income tax , but most of the boosting has been in the upper and upper-middle brackets . There is still plenty of elasticity in the lower and lower-middle ranges of income . And there remains the problem of making the high taxes work . Thus the inadequate product of the tax system is not due to the necessities of the private economy . The present business decline does not call for a moratorium on income taxes . Nor is the inadequacy due to insufficient resources or taxpaying capacity . The limiting factors in government finance are within the tax system itself ? administrative , political and legal factors . These factors will be discussed in greater detail in future articles . If the tax machine can not carry the tax load which has been or will be assigned to it , the reason is that the machine is poorly designed , or in bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
