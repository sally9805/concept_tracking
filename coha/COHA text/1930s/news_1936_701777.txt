txt The British Government is now doing to Germany what Elihu Root said on Feb. 15 , 1916 , that the Wilson administration was then doing to Germany , by first sending severe notes to Berlin and then mild ones ? " first shaking the fist and then the finger . " Anthony Eden , British Foreign Secretary , shook his fist yesterday in the first part of his speech in the House of Commons by vigorously denouncing Chancellor Adolf Hitler 's violation of the Locarno treaty . Then he said Hitler 's proposals for new treaties must be seriously considered . There was more of this fist-andfinger business today in the armament debate in Commons , which ended in a vote of 371 to 153 in favor of the government 's defense program , and this was received as a vote of confidence in the Cabinet . French Anger Reported . Immediately after adjournment there was a report in the lobby from Paris to the effect that there was no nape of France conceding anything to the British conciliatory view and that the French were flaming with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suggestion of Germany 's return to the League of Nations . The pro-French element in the British Foreign Office , which has long been dominant in framing the country 's Continental policy , is disturbed by the Cabinet 's finger-shaking , and to that extent there is a difference of opinion between the Foreign Office and Parliament , which almost unanimously opposed any act that might lead Britain into war . The press and public are even more unanimous . Conservative , Liberal and Socialist papers are all clamoring for new negotiations with Berlin , of course after reprimanding but not punishing Berlin . It is evident that the Cabinet itself is on the side of Parliament in this difference of opinion . Public opinion is now such that the government would find it difficult , if not dangerous , to be otherwise . It was the pressure of public indignation last December that forced Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin to abandon the Hoare-Laval Ethiopian plan , but . that indignation was nothing to what it would be now against any aggressive action by this country against Germany . Even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand sanctions , but it does deplore anything but sternness and aloofness toward Berlin at present and insists on firm action by the League of Nations before League members show any inclination to accept Hitler 's overtures . They contend that the sanctity of treaties must be upheld and that Britain and France must stand together without any sign of rift in the discussions of the Locarno powers and the League Council which are to take place this week in London instead of Geneva . They fear that if Britain adheres to the line the Cabinet forced Mr. Eden to take yesterday , ' France , backed by Russia and the Little Entente Czechoslovakia , Rumania and Yugoslavia , will take matters in her own hands , and , with ( Italy 's help , will dominate the whole Continental situation . Parley Shift Explained . The unexpected decision to trans-1 fer tomorrow 's session of the Lo , carno conference from Paris to London and that of the League Council from Geneva to London is interpreted here tonight as an indi'cation that Mr. Baldwin is determined to keep a close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is too difficult for the British delegates in Switzerland to keep in close touch with the British Cabinet . It is recalled that Mr. Baldwin confessed to Parliament that the Hoare-Laval fiasco was largely due to faulty communication between the Cabinet and its Foreign Secretary in Paris . The most severe thing the British Government has so far been willing to even consider is to join France in asking Germany to withdraw the troops already sent to the Rhineland and then to renew the various offers of last Saturday for nonaggression agreements , an air pact and return to the League . But even that mild gesture arouses no enthusiasm in London because it is considered a useless move which might mar the chances of the new negotiations now available . When the debate was resumed in Commons today on the government 's rearmament program most of the speakers either ignored the latest Locarno episode or followed yesterday 's lead from the government and urged that Hitler 's suggestions Should be developed into international action . Even Winston Churchill , who was so severe in his condemnation of Germany in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of getting a place in the Baldwin Cabinet , called for no punishment of that country for the Locarno treaty violation in his speech , but confined himself to urging quick preparation for fighting Germany later . Lloyd George Blames France . David Lloyd George , in one of the best speeches he has made since the war , went further . He was severe in his denunciation of Hitler for breaking pledges , but added that France also had violated her obligations . He then said Britain must not participate in any preventive war or any sanctions such as were contemplated in Paris . Hitler , he added , has " thrown open the door of opportunity , and , though it was done recklessly and dangerously with a bomb , it would be fatuous to ignore it . " " I am not going to question who is to blame , " said Mr. Lloyd George . " All I know is that I do not think France is in a position to point the finger of scorn at Germany on the ground of treatybreaking . . Loud cheers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Germany has broken a treaty ; but in a court of equity she would offer evidence which any judge would say provided some mitigation of her fault . " For twelve years or more France refused to carry out her undertaking to disarm , and even after Locarno , which was intended partly to provide a basis for disarmament , France increased her arms year by year . But we have to deal with facts . What is going to happen ? " I put one possibility , which I dismiss , for it has happened before . France might say , ' This is our last chance . Germany is only half ready . In two years it will be too late . ' France sincerely believes that . " But let her not forget the war of 1914 was made by that consideration . Germany said , ' Russia is preparing , making up all the deficiencies in her army after the great disaster of the Japanese war . ' And the German Army said , ' Unless you strike now it will be too late . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize that was disastrous counsel then . I can not imagine the French peasant will agree to anything of that kind now . " If we get negotiations which will end in twenty-five years of peace for Europe our defense problem would be a different one . " Mr. Lloyd George said it was fallacious to assume the Germany of today was as strong as the Germany of 1914 and continued : " She is the most formidable enemy the British Empire has fought , but we have fought her . We must not run away and work ourselves into a panic . " In 1911 Germany had as an ally Austria , with an army of 2,000,000 or 3,000,000 very brave men , led by an able general . Germany had as an ally also Turkey , who inflicted two severe defeats on us and held hundreds of thousands of our men for four years . " Germany is now completely isolated . Austria . on the whole is against her . I . am not talking of the little country known as Austria , but of the more formidable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welltrained army . They have about 1,000,000 men in all with reserves . " The other difference is that Russia in 1914 had an army which was disorganized , not very well led , fairly trained , utterly unequipped and with no means of equipping it behind the lines . Their transport was old . They had about 1,000,000 cavalry . That was their idea of war . They had hardly any guns . " The position now is that they have a peace army of 1,300,000 . Hitler said there were 17,000,000 trained men in reserve . Their transport is immensely improved ; they have a great intensive rail system behind the lines and they have the finest air force in the world . " Germany with no allies faces France , Russia and part of Austria together . The air force that could be brought in would overwhelm anything that Germany could produce . " The government can not proceed on the assumption that we are going to stand alone . Collective security does not mean we stand alone . It means you have all these forces together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when they offer a twentyfive-year guarantee of non-aggression I believe them , not because I accept the word of a statesman who may be here today and elsewhere tomorrow , but because in the very nature of things it would be an impossible enterprise for Germany with all these forces against her , " Churchill Stresses Rearming . Mr. Churchill devoted his speech largely to " the prodigious speed and scale of German rearmament . " He assured the House he admired the culture , skill , industry and bravery of the German people and declared " nothing would rejoice our hearts more than to see Germany take an ' honored place in the family of Europe , " but continued : " Since the arrival of Hitler in power three years ago the Germans have spent about ? 1,500,000,000 upon warlike preparations , directly and indirectly . These figures are stupendous . Nothing like them has ever been seen in time of peace . If they were exaggerated and the figures were only ? 600,000,000 , which Germany spent in 1935 , we would still be confronted with facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The fact that Germany is spending at this enormous rate upon armaments ' warns us not only of the magnitude of the danger hut also of its imminence . The expenditure on armaments means that the wages and livelihood of a very large proportion of the German people become dependent on military preparations . Several million people in Germany who were unemployed found employment in munitions manufacture or in the armed forces . " On the other hand , the whole is supported by borrowed money on a great scale , and the financial situation has become such that it can not go on indefinitely . The Ger- ' man Government will have to choose at a not distant date between internal and external catas-1 trophe , and can we doubt what course the man at the head of Germany would be likely to choose ? Germany Does Not Fear War . " Germany , we are told , is not yet ready for war . Yet she is the only nation in Europe unafraid of war . If what we have seen in the last few ' days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's imagine what the tone will be when the colossal preparations which are being made are approaching their . zenith and when at the same time the limits of international borrowing are already in sight . " Wars do not always wait until all the combatants are ready . I fear there may be a culminating point in the armaments history of Europe . I can not tell when it may be reached . It will certainly be reached in the lifetime of the present Parliament . " Let 's never accept the theory of inevitable war . Neither let us blind our eyes to the remorseless march of events . " Mr. Churchill urged that all Britain 's industrial resources be prepared immediately for possible needs in war . The present methods , he declared , are utterly inadequate . " It is not likely , " he said , " that we shall be able to overtake Ger-1 many and achieve air parity as is promised unless and until Germany herself decides to slow down and arrest her air expansion . There is a general impression that we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost time and that every month our relative positions will improve . That is a delusion . " Germany will be outstripping us more and more even if our new program is accepted and we shall be worse off at the end of this year than we are now despite all our exertions . " Later , discussing the navy , Mr. Churchill declared that August , 1937 , would be " the dangerous period in the armament history of Europe " and might find Germany with more submarines than she had in February , 1915 . Instead of spending millions of ' pounds now on new battleships that I could not be ready before 1940 Mr. Churchill urged the government to concentrate on building new de , strayers " to our utmost capacity . " Destroyers , he said , can be built quickly and " at this period in the affairs of this country it is the time factor which is vital . " Neville Chamberlain , who closed the debate , added nothing to the information contained in the government 's White Paper or to arguments of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that he agreed with David Lloyd George that there was no need for panic , but insisted that nothing had happened to lessen the necessity for Britain 's rearming.
