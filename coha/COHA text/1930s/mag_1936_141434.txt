One afternoon last week , 15 minutes before the close of the New York Stock Exchange , a few brokers raised their eyes to the two flag staffs at the northeast end of the trading floor , observed that the New York State flag was missing from its place beside the U. S. flag . Instead , they beheld the red banner of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics , its golden hammer &; sickle stirring gently under a slight draught . At this unprecedented sight , a group of reactionaries hissed , booed , catcalled . <P> Five minutes later , accompanied by Exchange President Charles R. Gay , the man the Red flag honored arrived in the private gallery of the Exchange : Soviet Russia 's Ambassador to the U. S. Alexander A. Troyanovsky , escorting Soviet People 's Commissar for Food Industry Anastas Mikoyan . Capitalists never had a more implacable enemy than Commissar Mikoyan . He is a genuine , bomb-throwing Old Bolshevik , who , with the final Soviet victory , rose to high Communist rank in the Caucasus . Last week he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was surprised to be told that U. S. banks have no memberships on the Big Board .
