Cheong yin Wong is a 27-year-old Chinese who is doing graduate work in experimental botany at Michigan State College . Last week his mentors announced that Cheong had produced seedless watermelons . He did it by removing the male elements of the flower from the vine before pollination could take place , treating the female with growth-stimulating chemicals . Some of his seedless melons are pear-shaped.
