Time Out of Mindmean ,  --  ' He 's going , almost time ! ' And if we make it like this ,  --  rap-rap ! rap-rap ! That 'll mean watch out . " We were bewitched with the idea , and practiced rappings till our knuckles were almost raw . Nat 's eyes would keep shining and we could hardly hold our faces straight as we sat in the parlor after supper . I remember we slipped out into the garden when the Major had buried himself in his paper , and that we sat close together on a stone bench talking of our plan in excitedwhispers . It was a warm July night and the fireflies in the shrubbery were thick as stars overhead . Nat caught one and made a cage of his hand about the winking glow . " If you were a bug , Kate , " he asked me , " would you rather be a firefly or a cricket ? " " I would n't be a bug for anything , " I told him , and Rissa , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be ? " He insisted . " A firefly 's prettier . " I decided , as I looked across the dark water and saw Whale Back Light flashing beyond the Narrows , hardly bigger than the bright speck between his cupped fingers . " Yes , but a cricket can sing . " He said . " Chirp , you mean . " Rissa was scornful . " Bo says they feel the frost in their hind legs the way he does in his knees when it 's going to rain . Hundreds and hundreds of them all rubbing their legs together , that 's what he says it is when we hear them in the fall . " Our great enterprize began the very next afternoon . It prosperedbetter than we had dared hope . I think Major Fortune must have been more worried that summer than even Henry Willis suspected not to have tracked down our guilty looks and flushed faces each time he set out with Bo in the dog cart . Why he did not inquire about the queer rappings that came from undertables and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand , but the S.S. double P. flourished and its three members grew bolder as each July day passed without mishap . He would have liked to take Nat with him on these drives to the ship-yard , but such long rides turned him faint and giddy and usuallyTime Out of Mind 41ended by humiliating them both . So he never guessed with what secret satisfaction the three demure faced children watched him take the reins and turn the horses towards the turnpike , or that the dim parlor rang to forbidden music once I could report them safely clattering over the wooden bridge . " Someday you young ones 'll get caught at it . " Mother protesteda week or so later when she discovered what use we were making of his absences . " If the Major finds Nat over that piano again I would n't answer for what he might do . " Still she kept our secret , and if the others knew , they gave no sign . It came to be like a play that we acted each day , and I crouching at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inlet , took my part with all seriousness . I felt the responsibility , for once Nat and Rissa opened the piano they forgot everything but the black and ivory keys and the little notes that climbed in and out of ink fence-rails . It seemed nothing short of miraculous to me , that those two could understand them , the same as I could printed words . I was an active child , and I must confess I grew pretty cramped and tired watching there on the window seat often for three and four hours at a stretch . Sometimes when they were going it together and the room full of beautiful sound I would strain my eyes till they ached to catch that one sight of the horses coming back over the bridge . I could n't have heard the hoof-beats on the wooden boards above the music and the great spruces hid the rest of the road . Still , it was sweet to have a part in this game which could bring bright color to Nat 's usually pale cheeks as he bent to the rows of keys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over them , and that he could tell if Rissa , playing beside him , struck a single false note or dragged a beat behind . It was mostly a queer jargon to my unmusical ears , but I began to have feelings about some of the pieces . I remember one in particular they talked about . " You see , Rissa , " Nat explained . " It was n't right the way Miss Ada Joy had you play it . Listen ! It 's like this . " His fingers flew over the keys and his thick hair shook in time as if every lock were alive . He was panting with excitement when he42 Time Out of Mindstopped . " It 's a polonaise . That 's a dance . I looked it up in the dictionary . " " Well , but my goodness , Nat , " she complained , " suppose it is . You need n't get so worked up over it . You 're as red as a turkey cock . " " It sounds like a barn dance they played down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my post . " They called it the Portland Fancy ' . " Nat wanted to know more about it , but I could n't even hum the tune . " A man named Chopin wrote this one . " He went on . " I like him and I wish Miss Joy had left more of his . It 's better a lot than this Poet and Peasant ' one . Now I 'm going to play what I made up last night in bed . " My right foot had gone to sleep but I did n't dare move once he began his own piece . He 'd played little snatches of tunes before , but this was different . I could n't believe he had really done it , and yet I knew Nat could do anything . Listening to it made me feel somehow queer and cold though the sun was coming in hot on my shoulders . There were deep , thunderous parts in it , like the sea or wind in branches , but soft parts , too , that made me feel the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " The Nightingale . " Yes , it was a kind of magic , I told myself . I knew it must be . Rissa knew a little of the magic , and poor faded Miss Ada Joy with her spectacles and black silk basque did too . They could both make the little notes come clear and precise from their fingers . But Nat could make you forget they were notes at all . Even I knew the difference . " Oh , Nat ! " I cried at the last note . " How could you make it up all by yourself ? Did you honest ? " I wanted to run to him , but I dared not risk leaving the windowseat . He nodded modestly , but his eyes were very bright . " It 's splendid ! " Rissa cried . " I like it lots better than that polonaise . Only it 's a shame we do n't know how to write it all down . " " I 've got to learn how to . " Nat 's face clouded suddenly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I 'm getting so I can keep them in my head . Come on , Rissa , let 's try that duet again . We did n't keep together last time . " " All right , Nat , move over on the bench . " I was n't held to the music as well when Rissa played with him . The long , late July afternoon was very warm and I was growing tired . I leaned my head against the window frame and kept to my watch behind the green damask curtains . The sun slanted through the ranks of nearby spruces , and below me the garden , which was George Button 's pride , showed yellow and blue and all shades of rose . I could watch bees going diligently from flower to flower , and tawny butterflies stayed so still sometimes they might have been anchored to the clumps of hollyhockand delphinium spikes . Through the gap , across the waters of the inlet , I could see men mowing in a far field . Their scythes sent out quick flashes in the sun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the little figures on the French clock , they too were part of Time 's machinery . It made me drowsy to watch them , so far and small in that yellowing meadow . Every so often I would shift my eyes to the green of the spruces that hid the driveway , where chipmunks moved , fleeter than shadows . I could not hear their chattering above the storm of music , but their quick dartings helped me fight off the drooping of my eyelids . " For I must n't get sleepy , " I told myself , whenever the road and distant meadow blurred before me . I could never explain , not then or afterwards , how it happened . Suddenly the duet stopped short , the notes chopped off in mid-air as if one of those far scythes had borne down upon them . Behind the curtains at my back was silence , so heavy and yet somehow tingling that I knew even before I heard the Major 's voice shatter it , that we were trapped there , all three of us together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panic as I peered round the curtain folds . I shall never forget how he looked standing there in the door , 44 Time Out of Mindway , enormous in his linen duster . He had not stopped to put back the carriage whip . I could see its long lash twisted about his boots . " So , " he spoke in the level , quiet voice that we always dreaded most , " this is what happens when I 'm away ! How long has this been going on ? " Those two at the piano did not move , though Rissa managed to answer . " Oh , Father , " she began , " we did n't mean any harm " " Only disobedience , eh ? " He dismissed her plea with a witheringglance . " You know what I told you both the last time I caught you at it . " Since there was no reply from the piano , he strode into the room , flicking the whip as he came . " Have you got anything to say for yourself ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , Sir , " Nat had grown white as the sheets of music on the rack . His words were half a whisper , then his lips shut fast again . Clarissa tried once more . " It was n't Nat 's fault , father , I  --  " She lied with all the cunningshe could muster . " It 's a duet and I could n't play it alone , so I thought you would n't mind just this once . " " Be quiet , Clarissa . " It infuriated him to have her take Nat 's part . " We do n't need any more from you . " He was standing over them now . " Stand up ! " He ordered his son sharply , " if you 've got gumption enough to ! " I saw Nat get up and stand by the piano with his lower lip sucked under his teeth . " You know I said you were not to touch that . " Major Fortunegave a fierce jerk of his head towards the black and ivory keys . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I did n't . " He spoke low , but when I heard him my heart felt like a cold pebble under my dress front . In the stillness I could hear the clock strike four deep notes . I knew how the little woodsmenwere sawing away with their cross-saws , but I only saw those two Nathaniel Fortunes facing each other . Time Out of Mind 45 " Hold out your hands ! " Clarissa started up with a smothered cry . Her father stopped her with a frown . Nat 's hands came out of his pockets , palms out , his fingers like twigs in the dimness . " No , the other way ,  --  as if you were playing that damned thing ! " Nat turned them over . I saw the whip-lash rise and fall with a smart crack across his knuckles . That brought me to as sharply as if it had been laid upon me . I have no remembrance of leavingthe window seat , but there I was beside them . I must have bobbed up before Major Fortune with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " I heard myself panting . " Well , by Godfrey ! " He stared down at me with the same queer look he had had on our first meeting . " You 've got no call to beat him ! " I could feel the words spurting out of me . I had forgotten how it annoyed him to see me overtopping his own son . I had forgotten everything but the way Nat 's hands looked still spread out and quivering . " Well , " he said , keeping his eyes on me so hard I could see the reflected squares of the window in the dark pupils , " you 're a spunky little varmint . I 'll say that for you . " He did not raise the lash again . After another moment of staring at us he turned on his heel . Rissa was crying by that time and Nat shook all over though he stood in the same spot . " Clear out of here , the lot of you ! " The Major spoke over his shoulder . " Go upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell you to leave it . " I did not wait to speak to Rissa , and I remember nothing more till I found myself climbing the ladder to the hay-loft . Sobs were gathering in my throat and tears blinded me so I could only feel for the rungs as I mounted . It had been my refugebefore and it was to be many times again , but never was I so in need of it as on that afternoon . Once I flung myself down in the dusty warmth of dried grass and clover I gave up to a flood of fright and fury and humiliation . I seldom cried46 Time Out of Mindand for this reason I was overwhelmed by the violence of my own tears . Between my gusts of sobbing I heard Rissa call my name guardedly from garden and orchard but I was past answeringher . So I burrowed deeper into the hay with no thought for my dress or the sharp spikes that scratched and half choked me . After awhile my weeping grew less wild . My tears were spent and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , face down , going over and over the whole scene , every look and word and motion of which was terrifyingly clear to me then and will be till the day I die . My own part in the catastrophe was what I could not reconcile . I was n't one to make allowances , at least , not for anyonebut Nat . I tried to think how I could have missed seeing the carriage come over the bridge . It is still a mystery to me . But I knew that I had somehow managed to fail in my part of the secret game that would never again be played in the east parlor . I had stood up to Major Fortune . That was only right and fair . I knew , though , for certainty that no good would come of it . " Things 'll never be the same again . " I said to myself there in the hot , sweet smelling hay-loft with my own despair . " He 'll fix it some way to get back at Nat . I know he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still at last after my wild crying . Through the criss-cross dried spikes I could look up at the enormous rafters where swallows swooped and fingers of light slanted through unseen gaps . The cows were back from pasture . I could hear George and Bo milking below me in the barn . Then they went off and I heard the supper bell ring from the kitchen . But I did not answer its summons . Faint stampings and munchings came from the stalls below , and an occasional squeak as families of field mice settled themselves somewhere in the hay . After awhile I sat up , sneezed , pushed my dusty , rumpled hair out of my eyes , and wiped my face with the hem of my skirt , before I started back to the house . They were all at supper and it was easy to slip in through the open front door . As I passed the dining room windows I couldTime Out of Mind 47 see Rissa and the Major alone at the table under the steady canvas stares of two Fortune portraits . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place a little pearl handled knife which I kept in my top dresser drawer . It was all I could think of to show Nat how sorry I felt for betraying him . He had lost his knife and I knew he would lose this , too , inside of a week . It seemed a pity because then we would n't have one between us . Still , I could n't think of any other gift to make him . I guessed that it would be risky to go to his door , but there was another way of reaching him . One of his windows gave on the ell side , and by climbing out on the roof I could reach it . The window was open and I started across the hot tin that felt like an oven lidunder my bare feet . " Nat , " I whispered , clutching the sill and bracing my feet onthe boards below . A chair scraped inside and then he came close . " You better sit on the edge , " he cautioned , " so 's you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sill , my legs dangling , and hecrouched on the floor , his elbows resting beside me . I could see his eyes were red , and I knew he had been crying . For a moment I did n't know how to begin . " Your hair 's all full of hay , " he said , pulling a wisp out andholding it between his fingers . The skin was blistered on one of his knuckles but not badly . " Did it hurt ? " I asked him . " Not much . It just smarts , kind of . " " Here , " I pulled the knife in its little chamois case out of mypocket and laid it on the sill between us . " You can have it . " " For tonight , or for keeps ? " " For keeps . " I tried to think of words for what I wanted tosay , but I was n't very good at that sort of talk . " I 'm real sorry , Nat , " I began at last , " about this afternoon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't . " " He was pretty mad , was n't he ? " Nat asked 48 Time Out of Mind " Madder'n hops . Nat , you know I would n't not have told you if I 'd seen him in time ? " " I know . " He told me . " But I wish you had . " " So do I. I do n't see how I could have missed them on thebridge . I never did before . What 's he going to do ? " " He 's getting George to put a padlock on the piano , andRissa 's to take lessons at Miss Ada Joy 's from now on . " " Then you wo n't ever get a chance at it again ? " " I guess not . " He sighed heavily . " Anyway not till I 'm grown up and go away from here . " " It 's meaner than mean . " I kicked at the clapboards till my toes tingled . We were silent there together for a long time . The western sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark points of the spruces . Gulls were letting the sunset take them home to the outer islands and the white washed tower of Whale Back Light stood out to sea like a far candle . " Maybe , " I said , " he would n't lock it up if we all went and said we were sorry and we would n't do it again ? " " But I would , " he shook his dark head , " first chance I got . " " I 'd give up going to the launching , " I promised in sudden recklessness , " if ' t would do any good ? " " It would n't . " He began to drum on the window sill . It was a way he had , making up tunes that only he knew and understood . " I guess we have to wait till we grow up to do things we want to . " I told him . " I know . " He agreed , " but it 's a long way off . " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nat . Remember what Old Lady Phibben said when she looked at your hands ? " I reminded him . " She said you 'd be spreading them out in glory someday . " " It was funny that part about the white horses , was n't it ? " He looked thoughtful . " Father 's are all bays and sorrel . " " You watch out same 's she said to . " I cautioned . Just then a door banged somewhere below us and steps sounded on the brick walk . That meant supper was over and it would be betterTime Out of Mind 49for me not to linger . Still , I hated to go , and I had n't said what I had meant to . It was different talking to Nat like this , just the two of us by ourselves without Rissa to break in . " Nat , " I tried again , and the words came out in a sudden burst . It was easier now that I could hardly see his face for the fading light . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't . " Once I had got them out , I felt unaccountably shy and foolish , so I let myself down to the ell roof and made off withoutwaiting for any answer . CHAPTER VHow shall I write of those early fall mornings ? How shall I tell of the peculiar glaze that came upon every berry and leaf and grass-blade , or how the sea was bright beyond all believing , and crickets beating out their shrill pulses in the burnt brown grass ? It was as if some inner hint of frost quickened every livingthing to put forth its best of color and fruit and song . We three children felt it stirring in our veins , though we had no means to show it except our overflowing high spirits . That was my first sight of September by this northern coast , and though I have seen so many autumns flare since then , never yet have I been able to believe in the glory my eyes were beholding . Day after day we.watched the dark wedges of wild geese fly south and marveled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep with frosty warning . " How do they know ? " I asked Rissa and Nat , the first time I saw the dark wings and long , shifting triangles pass overhead . " How do they know when it 's time and where to go ? " " They must have little compasses inside them . " Nat told me . " That 's where they have it easier than people . " " Yes , " Rissa said , " but they are n't smart enough to tell the decoy ducks from real ones . George has got his out already and he 's going to put them down by the creek soon . " " Does he shoot them ? " I was horrified , as I had been before about the seals . " Oh , yes , " she nodded , " Father says there 's nothing he likes so much as a roast wild duck , but Nat and I wo n't ever touch a mouthful . " " We could n't , " Nat said making a face. 50Time Out of Mind S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed . " I think it 's dreadful , settingout wooden ones that look like their mates to trap them and shoot them down . I hope they fool George and get away . " But for all our wishes George shot plenty that fall . I can remember the sight of the first one he brought in as it lay on the kitchen table . I did not want to look at it , but horror and curiositydrew me there in spite of myself . It was so different from the taut , living birds I had seen taking the blue only a little while before . This one lay heavy and limp , a heap of feathers that showed shifting colors as I blew on the soft breast and head . The wings were lax and long , and the feet strong and webbed , yet delicate in all their creasings . Blood had dripped and dried on the proud beak , and the open eyes , though they were glazed in death , still kept a kind of wild surprise . I could n't help thinking of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by , and as I did so I turned and ran crying from the kitchen . Mother was put-out later when I would n't help her pluck it . " Now do n't you go and get notions , " she scolded . " It 's all very well for Nat and Rissa to get finicky , but you ca n't . Where would I be if I took on so over every dead bird I had to cook ? " But she could n't make me touch a feather . I think she was glad that the fall term of school would begin for me in a couple of weeks . She liked me to pick up nice ways of talking and such from Nat and Rissa , but she did n't want me to catch other tricks from those two . It was over a month since the Major had discovered our secret , and we were only just beginning to breathe easily again after that encounter in the east parlor . The piano had been locked ever since and Major Fortune had often looked long and disapprovingly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , and we began to think we had come off easily once his temper had passed . He was away from the house much of those early fall days for he was busy with plans for the launching . Sometimes he did not come home at all but stayed the night with Henry Willis to be near the ship-yard . His mind52 Time Out of Mindand heart were bent upon his new vessel and indeed the whole countryside thought and talked of little else . It was several years since there had been an important launching thereabouts , and all Little Prospect was agog . The Fortune saw mill was humming , and nearly all the able men not already employed there or in the ship-yard were busy with extra work on the " Rainbow . " Even the minister had made mention of the great event from his pulpit the Sunday before , as if God Himself must hold it in special regard . Rissa and Nat and I had exchanged discreet nudges in the Fortune front pew when the Reverend Chase had fervently petitioned heaven for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sermon text : " She sent out her boughs unto the sea , and her branches unto the river , " we had smiled with stealthy satisfaction . We could not help knowing that this concerned us more intimately than the rest of the congregation . Rissa was to christen the " Rainbow " with the cob-webby bottle her father had fetched from the highest shelf in the wine cellar , and Nat and she were going to be at Major Fortune 's side along with their cousins from Philadelphia . I would be going , too , and we would all have new outfits . For a week past Miss Addie Jenkins had been up at The Folly every day cutting and fitting yards of India muslin and pale blue taffeta to Rissa , who vowed she lay awake nights thinking of the care she must take wearing it . Her Aunt in Philadelphia had been commissioned to send a new hat and it was gone to gaze upon it in its bandbox at least three times a day . Mother had entered into the spirit of the occasion so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaid mohair for me . She worked on it at odd moments under the dressmaker 's directions , and there were a good many head shakings over the size of the waist band and the difficulty of giving it proper style once my sturdy body was inside . " I 'm like to die fitting you , Kate , " Miss Addie would sigh through her bristling mouthful of pins . " You put me in mindTime Out of Mind 53of that old dory my brother Dan rigged up once in a madeoversail . Well , it 's lucky you wo n't be in Rissa 's shoes at the launching . " With the Major so much away and everyone so busy we three had more freedom than ever , and we made the most of it , though Nat would sometimes go and stand sadly in front of the locked piano . But for the most part we entered into the bustle of preparations . The house had to be thoroughly overhauled against the arrival of the Philadelphia cousins , whose coming Nat and Rissa dreaded as much as I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her two daughters were several years older and far more stylish and grown up according to their memories of the last visit . It was a relief when we heard they would drive directly to the ship-yard from the train and not go with us in the carriage . Even the tide seemed to have entered into the spirit of the affair , for it would be nine o'clock in the evening before the water would be high enough to float the " Rainbow " . A night launching was considered an even greater event than one taking place in broad daylight . " Not much chance of a fog with the September moon coming on to the full , " we heard George Button tell mother . " Yes , sir , everything looks prosperous . " We pestered him with questions and he explained how you could n't be too careful where moon and tides were concerned . He gave long , rambling accounts of other launchings where owners had taken foolish chances and let their vessels leave the ways with a moon on the wane . That was flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for anyone who knew anything at all knew hard luck and dwindling profits were certain to follow . " No , " he told us , " ' tis n't safe to trifle with the elements . Sooner or later they pay you back for it . " George had been to sea in his young days and the talk of the launching set him singing sea songs in such lusty tones that his wife scolded and she and mother and Rose complained they were nearly distracted hearing him . But we could never get54 Time Out of Mind Time Out of Mind 55enough of them , and often joined him in our favorite ,  --  " Root , Hog , or Die . " Once , I remember , we were singing it full blast , all four of us , as George weeded the driveway , when the Major and Henry Willis drove in . We had got as far as the verse : " Now we 've got her fore and aft , and we 'll go below , The wind is to the eastward and like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about and never saw the sky , At last we shot in Port Latoun ,  --  Root , Hog , or die ! " But instead of scolding us for singing a verse with " devil " in it , the Major and Henry Willis smiled broadly . They got out of the carriage and walked up the drive together and we followed , near enough to hear what they were saying about us . " Sounds as if Nat was getting the salt water spirit , " Henry Willis chuckled . " He 's going to know more'n to sing about taking reef and getting her fore and aft before I 'm through with him ! " was the Major 's only comment . Then he squinted at the red ball of sun , slipping behind the islands and gave a satisfied smile . " Well , Henry , " he added , " looks as if we could count on favoring weather . " It turned suddenly cold the evening before the great day , and so I had my first glimpse of northern lights on the eve of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they must always seem the strangest and most stirring of all natural wondersto me . We should have missed them but for George who called us out of the parlor to behold the spectacle . Nat and Rissa and I pressed close together at the window in the upper hall , awed into silence by the northern sky . Over the far crest of Jubilee Mountain the heavens were bristling with long fingers of ghostly white . They dimmed and brightened and swept down almost to the edge of the shore and the Narrows . Sometimes ice-green wheels moved through them and flashes of red appeared and disappeared eerily . And there was not asound . They flared in a stillness that brought queer chills to my ten year old bones . " What do they mean ? " I asked , shaken by the sight . " Cold weather coming , " said Rissa , " and a bad winter . At least that 's what they said the other time we saw them . " " But not a bad sign for the launching ? " I pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must n't say things like that , Kate ,  --  come on , let 's all go right to bed now , and make it tomorrow sooner . " By morning we had forgotten them in the bustle of preparations . Hours slipped by in a frenzy of helping pack baskets of food ; of running errands to garden and orchard and barn ; of scrubbing and brushing and combing , and the last putting on of finery . Nat had a velvet jacket the color of russet leaves , and his eyes were all dark pupil under his hair that would never stay slicked and smooth . My round head was painfully neat and moist to keep down my cowlicks and my cheeks were scarlet from soap and water . I hardly recognized myself in the madeoverplaid , and I had brand new button boots with tassels and a squeak that Nat insisted sounded louder than old Deacon Black passing the plate in church . But when Rissa appeared she drove all other thoughts from my mind . " She 's a picture and no mistake , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs to join us . " The Major'il be prouder'n Lucifer when he claps eyes on her . " Rose agreed . " I hope to goodness she do n't spill anything down her front . " " Trust her not to , " mother sighed as she smoothed her own best black dress . " Young 's she is she always looks as if she 'd come out of the bureau drawer . I wish Kate had the knack of it , she 's commenced to lose her starch already . " " Rissa , " Nat told her as we waited for George to bring the horses round , " there wo n't be anyone at the launching can hold a candle to you , will there , Kate ? " " No , " I said loyally , my eyes glued to her trim grace under56 Time Out of Mindthe draped blue and white , " she 'd ought to be on the cover of a soap box . " It was no small compliment that I gave her , for then we children had few colored pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the faint deepening of pink in her cheeks , but she kept her lips pressed tight in a way she had when she felt a lot depended upon her . " You 'd throw the bottle lots better , Kate , " she said generously , " I 'm so scared I wo n't break it . Father 'd never get over it if I did n't . " Just then Bo and George drove up . We three children were swung into the front seat , while mother and the rest sat in the hack with all the baskets . " Well , " George Button called out in his best sea-voice , " all aboard there , and all sail set ! " Roadsides were bright with asters and goldenrod all the way , and mountain ash trees loaded with fiery fruit . Bo picked a branch as we passed and Nat had a bunch for his button-hole and I one to wear in my brown straw hat . Once we got on the turnpike all sorts of rigs were headed in the same direction ,  --  old buggies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbors . It might have been election or County Fair day from the cluttered roads and desertedhouses , and from the white triangles of sail all headed for Fortune 's Ship Yard . It seemed as if everyone would be there before us and we three worked ourselves into a fever of impatience before the five mile ride was ended . But at last we were there and the place as gay with bunting as the fall trees had been along our way . I had thought to keep with Nat and Rissa but once we were set down from the carriage Henry Willis bore the two away to join their Philadelphia cousins and I was left with mother and the Jordan family . Jake Bullard was there in his best Sunday suit and though he had scowled at sight of my two companions , he joined me after awhile and we prowled about together . He andTime Out of Mind 57some of his cronies had been there for hours and it pleased him to show off the sights and answer my foolish questions . " I 'll show you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We got plenty of time before we eat supper . " I followed him up a ladder into an old sail loft where the view was uninterrupted by tall bodies , or hurrying workmen . I had only been in the brick office once , so I had had no notion what a bustling ship-yard could be on the eve of a launching . No vessel in harbor had ever looked so vast as this one ,  --  set high and dry , with stern to sea and great wooden timbers holding it like giants ' arms . " That 's the cradle she sets in , " Jake told me . " It has to cant just that much and no more . If ' t was half an inch out there 'd be trouble when they started the blocking . " I did n't understand till after it was over what he had been talking about , but I listened as if I did . All the time he pointed this or that out to me I was thinking how the figures of the men working on the hull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enormous hive . The hammers and men 's voices mingled into a sort of gigantic buzzing . Even without her masts , which Jake explained would not be set up till she lay at the wharf , the " Rainbow " loomed like a monster . High and dry she rose above the water that was steadilyrising to receive her . A rich smell I had never known before hung low over the whole yard . There has been none like it since , for it was made up of lesser smells ,  --  the steam of hot iron from the blacksmith 's forge ; boiling tar ; hemp rope ; freshly sawed lumber , and the tallow greasing the ways under that untried keel . My nose quivers yet at remembrance of it . " There 's Cousin Sam , " I pointed out . " I did n't know he 'd be working on it . " " Why , he 's a master hand at the blocking , " Jake told me scornfully . " I guess there could n't be a launching without him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Is that hard to do ? " I ventured , there being no one else about to hear my ignorance. 5 8 Time Out of Mind " Holy Moses , yes ! You just wait and see . He 'll have to be quick as lightning . Sometimes there ai n't even time for him to get out ' fore she starts . He 'll deal that last block a regular knock and then maybe he 'll have to throw himself down quick and let it go right over him down the ways . " " Oh , my , Jake , wo n't he be all squashed ? " " No , Sir , he wo n't . He says there 's plenty of room if he lays flat . It 's loose timbers and blocks flying round he has to watch out for . I wish they 'd let me do it . " I could n't help staring at Jake with new admiration , for he looked as if he really could do it with those big-knuckled fists of his . My expression must have pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not leave me to join the Little Prospect boys . We found mother and the Jordan tribe and though I missed Nat and Rissa , still I was glad of Jake and his wide grin and pushing elbows in all the crowd . We ate our supper , picnic fashion on a point not far from the yards . Besides Jake there were other schoolmates about me ,  --  Abbie Stanley and her brother Joe ; Dan Gilley and Mollie and his older sister Sadie , as well as Cousin Martha Jordan 's Ruth and Hilda . I felt shy at first after being with Nat and Rissa all summer long . But little by little it got to seem like recess in the school yard again , and we ate apples and crullers , and eggs and pie as lively as could be . Only I could n't forgetthose other two , not even when we skipped stones and played tag on the strip of shingle , getting as near the tide line as we dared without wetting our best shoes . I was careful not to talk with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for I knew they would n't like it , and would say I was getting stuck up and full of corn-starch airs . I 'd heard them talk among themselves about the Fortune pair before now . As it was , Abbie and Ruth and even tall Sadie got discussing Rissa 's clothes till I was ready to fly out at them . " Did you see her ? " Sadie laughed to the others . " Why she looks all rigged up like a Maypole . Mother says it 's a shame and she 's only going on thirteen ! " Time Out of Mind 59 " And him in a jacket like the one the monkey wore in the circus ! " Jake jeered . " A regular Miss Nancy that 's what he is ! " Joe Stanley was scornful . It would have ended in a squabble most likely and I would n't have been able to hold my own against so many dissenting voices , only just then the others called us to help carry the baskets back to the wagons . Already the sun had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the western point . A fall chill was in the September air and I felt glad of mother 's old paisley shawl though it was so long I had to hold up its fringes with both my hands . We found good places near enough to see the busy men on the dark hull . The noise of hammering and shouting had grown louder . The very air was charged with a kind of current from all the human beings gathered together in that place . But at the time I could not guess that . I only knew that under my layers of shawl and dress my heart began to beat in time to the hammers . Flaring torches had been lit and in the yellow flickering light the ship-yard looked vast and strange . All the familiar faces about me wore an unnaturally sharp , bright look . The tide was well up now and still rising . I could not see how far the timbers Jake had called the cradle stretched into the dimness , but I know that nothing again will ever seem so tremendous to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . There still lacked some minutes before the Septembermoon would be up . " Kate , " I suddenly heard Nat 's voice at my side and felt his hand . " I thought I 'd never find you in all these people . Come on with me . " " But , Nat , " I began , " there is n't room , is there ? " " Hurry , " he urged me , " Father wo n't notice , and he wo n't care anyhow , he 's too busy . You can squeeze in by me on the platform . " Mother nodded and we began picking our way back between all the close pressed legs and skirts . It was n't till we were safely up on the rough piece of scaffolding above all the heads and al-6o Time Out of Mindmost overhanging the great bows , that I knew how disappointed I had been not to see it all with those two . I could not get close to Rissa , but we smiled at each other , and I knew they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red cloth cape over her finery . It made her look taller and more grown up than she had in the afternoon . She stood beside her father and her Aunt and the two Philadelphia cousins , the bottle with all its ribbons pressed close to her chest and her lovely face a little pale and anxious . " Rissa 's a whole lot prettier'n your cousins , " I whispered to Nat . " Yes , " he nodded , " and I think her clothes are nicer too , but she does n't now she 's seen their 's have got fur trimming . " " Moon 's up  --  over there ! " Someone cried above the poundingsas an orange rim began to show above the wooded ridge of Ragged Island . " There 's a sight for you , Esther , " I heard Major Fortune say to his sister with a wave of his arm , as if he had somehow contrived to make it rise . Up and up it crept till the shining ball had cleared the black trees . The red drained out as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and golden , above its own broad silver track . The farther islands swam in that brightness like bristling-backed monsters , and though I was already used to moonlight over sea and islands , yet somehow this was different from all other moons . I turned to Nat who stood quiet beside me . " Nat , " I said because I felt somehow frightened by it . But before I could speak or he could answer me , the hammer blows were beginning to fall with curious heavy thuds on the wooden blocks . " It 's begun , " I cried to him above the sudden commotion . He nodded and from that moment his eyes got big and dark and far removed from me . There will never be any sound like that for me till the day I die . The air was alive with a great throbbing pulse of hammer beats , hundreds of them all going it together . At last those quickening blows and my own heart beats became one in someTime Out of Mind 61strange and indescribable way . I lost all count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound and the dark shapes of men 's bodies and arms rising and falling in the smoky glare below me . They made me think of the little men going through their motions on the clock in the east parlor . I tried to tell Nat , but he hardly seemed to hear me . His cheeks had grown red , the way they never were except when he played the piano and he kept time to the hammers , beating with his clenched fist on the wooden railing as if he were part of it all . The blocks of wood were falling away under the blows so fast it made me giddy to watch . And then there was a pause , and a whisper went round that it was time for the christening . " Friends , " Major Fortune 's voice went out to the farthest corners as he stepped to the edge of the make-shift platform and leaned out over the " Rainbow 's " forepart , " there 's no call for me to make a speech . I 'm not much given to words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cargoes are my line and I 'll back my last dollar on them every time . I do n't need to tell you that my father and my father 's father sent Fortune ships round the globe and that the best went into their making then and now . " Someone broke in there with a cheer and other voices took it up in a mighty cheer that silenced the Major for more than a minute . I could see his eyes were pleased under their beetling brows , though there was a sort of heaviness in his voice as he went on . " Times may not be what they were and shipping may not be so prosperous as it once was , but I 'm not one to break with the past for any new notion afloat . Fortunes have always built the finest wooden ships that sailed , and this vessel here on the ways is sound in every beam , that 's all I 've got to say . " He stepped back to more cheers as the Reverend Chase took his place to pronounce a blessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stole a look at Rissa . She had slipped out of the red cape and I could see her hands shaking about the bottle . " Oh , Lord , " I prayed in a more personal petition than the Reverend Chase , " please let it break good and hard when she throws it . " 6z Time Out of Mind Time Out of Mind 63Only those of us who stood close could hear Rissa say :  --   --  I christen thee Rainbow ' " , but a rewarding splinter of glass followed , and a sharp fragrance rose from the bows . A moment later the poundings began with renewed vigor . Now they were coming faster and faster , with a kind of ringing wildness that was like a storm of sound . Then the last blows fell . Braces cracked and solid blocks spurted as if they were no more than chips flying before an axe . Suddenly there was a rending and splintering the like I have never heard before or since , and the whole great mass began to move , as if it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweat-glazed men leaped aside as the great hull settled down into her cradle . It slid with her while she moved steadily on and out over the greased ways . Above the noise of ripping wood and rushing water , a cry went up :  --  " She 's floated ! Hip-hip-hooray , Rainbow ! " Nat 's cold fingers were gripping mine . My heart seemed to swell inside me , and my whole body to be swallowed up in its beating . I knew that I was shouting along with the rest , and the usually demure Rissa was hopping up and down and waving her handkerchief . Only the Major stood quiet , with head craned forward , to watch the welcoming surge of water . " Took it neat as a dolphin , " he cried out to Henry Willis , relievedand jubilant . In the confusion that followed I have no very clear notion ofwhat happened next . But I began to know that something wasthe matter . I heard cousin Sam Jordan 's name on people 's lips . " He 's hurt ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have caught him . " And from far off the call . " Anybody seen Doc Robinson ? " I tried to beat my way through all the crowd to find mother , for I had already lost Nat and Rissa . Instead I kept being pushed down nearer to the mass of timber and wrecked wooden supports . Odd shaped wedges tripped me up and I would have fallen save for the close pressed bodies of men and women . Ajumble of talk was going on above me , and I made out a little of what they were saying . " No , he ai n't stirred yet . " " Must have hurt him inside . " " Anybody fetching the brandy ? " " Here 's Doc now ,  --  let him through . " A woman was crying beside me , an old woman I had seen in the village . Tears were running down her wrinkles , and she kept saying over and over how it was a bad sign . There had n't been an accident at a launching in twenty years , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone knew what had happened to her off the coast of Guinea . It was Bo who found me at last and I was glad to cling to his black hand and let him take me to the carriage . Rissa and the Cousins from Philadelphia had already started back , but Nat and I were hoisted beside Bo on the front seat . All the way home in the bright moonlight they talked of the accident . Cousin Sam Jordan was badly hurt , crushed by falling timbers as he he knocked away the last blocks . No one knew whether he would come to or not . His mishap had somehow made the glory of the launching fade to second place . Mother and Annie and Rose could talk of nothing else the whole way . Even black Bo joined in as he slapped the reins on the horses ' backs . " There was blood on that moon . Yes sir , I knows the sign . " " Oh , Bo , there was n't , was there ? " Nat and I shivered to hear him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all on edge , Bo , " Mother told him . " I expect signs ai n't all they used to be along with other things . You two stop bothering your heads about it and watch out you do n't fall over the dashboard . " " Well , it was a nice launching anyhow , " I whispered to Nat as we lolled against one another , " and we saw every bit of it . " But he was beating time on my knee . I could feel his cold fingers through my skirt . " They went like that , " I heard him saying softly to himself . " First sort of slow and then faster and faster 64 Time Out of MindHis voice trailed off but his hands kept on thumping for a long time as the carriage swayed and jolted on its way with the moon high in mid-heaven , laying strange brightness on the Narrowsand outer islands and on the broad backs of Fancy and Fanny as they took us home . CHAPTER VIFoR me , the launching must always stand for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the long summer of close companionship with Nat and Rissa was over , and I must set out alone each morning early with my lunch and schoolbooks . SomehowI could n't feel as easy with the boys and girls from Little Prospect as I had , not after taking on so many of the Fortune ways . I was always having to remember not to say this or that before Jake and the rest , or if I forgot , as I sometimes did , I must face their ready jeers . Looking back on it now through all these years , I wonder I managed as well as I did , not being gifted at play-acting . Feeling ran high against Major Fortune in Little Prospect after the launching . I caught echoes of this from my schoolmates . It was partly because of the accident , for though Cousin Sam Jordan did n't die as a result of it , he had suffered serious injury . In all fairness it must be said of the Major that he did all anyone could be expected to do for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and I know that all through that winter and the next he continued to pay him wages . Still , Cousin Martha complained that Fortune 's did n't care how many good men were sacrificed so long as one of their vessels got launched with plenty of hurrahs . Her complaints had more weight with the rest of Little Prospect because a captain from Boston had been chosen to take the " Rainbow " on her first voyage . There were at least three men in the neighborhood who were qualified for such command and who had expected to get it . It rankled the whole community that this had been given to an outsider. 6566 Time Out of Mind " Little Prospect men knew enough to take Fortune ships out in his father 's and grandfather 's day , " they complained in the village . " You did n't catch them sending off for any Boston or New Bedford skippers . " " And if Abe Morse is good enough for first mate , he 's good enough to take command . Nathaniel Fortune need n't set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , Sam Jordan getting struck . Say what you want to , it 's a bad sign for a first voyage and he 'd better watch out . " So , though the work of fitting out the " Rainbow " was pushed forward , the old zest and spirit had gone out of the undertaking . I heard more than mother and George and Annie guessed . Young as I was , I put two and two together , and knew that the Fortune family had fallen out of favor . But this only made me the more stubborn in my devotion . If the Major heard echoes of dissatisfaction he never let on by so much as a look . He picked his crew from up and down the coast according to his own judgment , and when the cargo of Maine spruce and pine planks was cut and ready at the Fortune sawmill , he had the " Rainbow " towed into Little Prospect where he might see to her final fitting and loading . Henry Willis and he and the Captain from Boston were in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's horrid , " Nat told me of the newcomer . " He bellows like Sawyer 's bull , and he 's always slapping me on the back and saying Hey , there , my hearty ! " Yes , " Rissa was in full agreement , " and he calls me Sissy ' . His hands are too big and all covered with red hairs . " We children were united in our dislike of Captain Mac Murty . He was a huge , red haired man in the fifties , with a voice so used to quarter deck commands , that he could be heard all over Fortune 's Folly when he came in for his meals and long conferencesin the Major 's study . We shrank from all encounters with him , though he tried to make jovial remarks to us and even presented Rissa with a piece of carved ivory he had carried forTime Out of Mind 67years in his pocket . Nat particularly resented him , and shrank away when he was near . " I wish he 'd hurry up and take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me after one of the Captain 's efforts at friendliness . " I hate him . " But it was mid-October before the sailing day was set . The line storm had come late that year , and when it was past a kind of brief and beautiful second summer lingered along the coast . Birches and maples stayed yellow , and swamp and rockmapleswere bright flares by any bit of water . In The Folly garden we gathered fierce last blooms of dahlias , zinnias and asters . Everywhere the smell of ripe apples mingled with seasalt . We three played in the cornfield among the bunched stalks that looked like an Indian village with pumpkins between every wigwam . Only the crickets , shrilling more frantically from brown grass , were not deceived by this false trickery of warmth and royal color . On one October Saturday the Major took us aboard the " Rainbow " . It was the first time I had ever set foot upon a vessel and the height of her masts , so tremendous as we stood below and stared up at the yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder to me . So was the galley with its stove and pots and crockery , and the quarters for Captain and Mate , with those high bunks above the built-in drawers . Nat could not look long at the masts . It turned him dizzy to think of men climbing so high to reef sail in a strong blow . So we stayed longest hanging over the stern , watching the men who sat on swinging seats painting lines of color just above the letters of her name . The Major had taken a fancy to have a rainbow done there in a bright arch . " It 's a beauty , " Nat said , " ' just like the one we saw over the Narrows last summer , do you remember ? " " Yes , " I told him , " and it 'll last lots longer in paint . " Even the Major had to laugh at that as he came by to take us back . We were so happy together that afternoon . As I look back68 Time Out of Mindon it , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the woods from the old landing by the bridge , and when we stopped for another game of hide-and-seek among the corn stalks . We were like the fall crickets in our shrillness , and I hope they guessed as little as we did how shortly frost and other changes would come upon us . Nat was the liveliest of us three . It seems strange to think of that now . The " Rainbow " was all set to sail on the following Wednesdaymorning . There was more bustle than ever in the village and Major Fortune on board most of the time . On Tuesday I went off to school as usual , and those two walked part way with me in the crisp morning freshness . Lessons had not yet begun for them and I felt low spirited as they turned back and I ran on to a long day at my desk . It was longer than ever as it turned out , for I made so many mistakes in fractions that the teacher kept me after school . Before I reached the last mile it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea . Fog had swallowedthe sunset and the islands were faint beyond the Narrows . By looking over my shoulder I could make out the shape of the " Rainbow " riding at anchor near the harbor ; her bows dark and pointing ; her rigging thin as threads of spider web . But I gave little thought to it as I hurried on . Just where the road dipped into a wooded patch , I heard a cry and a figure rose from between the tree trunks to meet me . " Rissa ! " I cried , startled , for she had never come alone to meet me so far . Even before I reached her I could see she was all upset . Her red cape blew out half fastened and her hair streamed wildly on her shoulders . " You 're crying , " I said , " what 's the matter ? " I knew it was Nat , even before she told me . " Oh , Kate , " she began to sob , her eyes running over and her clear , pale face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waiting , I thought you 'd never come . Something terrible 's hap-pened " She shook so she could n't go on for a minute and we stood close together there , among dusty goldenrod and asters . Time Out of Mind " Is it about Nat ? " She gulped and nodded . " This morning , " she managed to tell me between sobs , " after we came back . Father ,  --  he was talking to Captain Mac Murty , and then ,  --  he  --  he called Nat in to the study . I listened , and it was awful " Did he take the whip to him again ? " " Lots worse than that . He 's going to send him away ,  --  on the ' Rainbow ' tomorrow . " I guess I must have looked more scared than she thought I would for she began to cry harder than before . I felt suddenly dull and queer inside my chest , the way I always did when the teacher called on me for things I did n't know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew sick feeling and empty . " He said he 'd been planning it a long time , ever since he caught us at the piano , " she went on . " He said it was the only way to make a man of him . Nat cried and I ran right in and cried , too , but it did n't do any good , not a bit . " " And it 's tomorrow , " I kept saying that over to myself . It was growing dim at the edge of the woods as we stood there together . Rissa , with all her pride and corn-starch airs gone , was clinging to me with cold fingers . Our tears mingled in the dust at our feet . There was nothing I could do and she knew it , but we were very close in our despair . " There 's Henry Willis , " I said , " maybe he could do some-thing . " " He tried . He was up for dinner and he tried to talk father out of it . Nat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Did Nat promise he 'd never play anything again ? " " He promised everything he could think of , and I did too . Nothing 's any use with father when he 's made his mind up . You know it is n't , Kate . " " I know . Where 's Nat now ? " " They took him down to the yard with them . They went hours ago and I got so I could n't stay alone up there anymore waiting for you . " 6970 Time Out of MindWe hurried back through the fall twilight , talking in broken snatches , even making wild , impossible schemes for hiding Nat ; for outwitting the Major before sailing time next day . But all the time we knew there would be no chance to carry them out . Nat was as lost to us as if the " Rainbow " was already past Old Horse Ledges and the outer islands . Neither of us could eat a mouthful of supper or heed anything mother and Annie said to us . The dog-cart was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often done before , in an old closet under the stairs . It was a favorite hiding spot , and smelled of leather and woolen garments , hanging from their pegs . It was somehow comforting to feel the familiar folds of capes and coats so close about us . Perhaps , we told each other as we listened for the thud of hoofs on the drive , there might be some way out . We even prayed , separatelyand together , but as Rissa pointed out , she had been praying ever since morning without any effect . The clock in the east parlor struck seven and eight and then half past , before we heard wheels . Our tears and long stay in the dark closet made us blink as we came out into the hall . It took a minute to see things right . " Nat ! " Rissa ran to him with a quick cry that ended in a fresh burst of tears . But I could n't move or speak . I just stood there staring to see the change one afternoon had made in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked down the road with me that morning . There he stood , fitted out in long , dark trousers much too big for him . A rough pea-jacket was buttoned up to his chin , and a round cap was clutched in one hand . His waving mane of dark hair was gone , clipped sailor-fashion so close to his head he looked like a skinned rabbit . His eyes had the scared , half-glazed look of a rabbit , too , as he shrank , shorn and spindling , between his father and Captain Mac Murty . " Well , no wonder you 're surprised ! " the Captain let out a tremendous laugh , seeing our two faces . " Would n't know him for the same boy , would you ? " Time Out of Mind 71I could see Nat 's chin begin to shake and his teeth catch his underlip in the way I knew so well . But I could n't move from my place by the closet door or fling myself sobbing upon him as Rissa was doing . " Come , Rissa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with unaccustomed sharpness . Nat stiffened and drew away from her , frowning in a last fierce effort not to cry . His eyes reached out to me across the hall . He must have seen the horrified pity in mine , for suddenly he flung his arm across his face and stumbled past us up the stairs . I had no chance to see , much less to speak to him next morning . Rissa walked with me as far as the gate , but neither of us said a word till we reached the road . " Father says he does n't trust me to go down and see them off , " she said at last . " I guess it do n't matter now , " I told her , shifting my lunch and books . " No , " she agreed , and then her eyes darkened harshly as I had never seen them do before . " If we were older we could do something , " she went on , her hands pressed tight together . " Father need n't think I 'll ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't . " I was almost frightened by her look and voice . Neither of us could cry anymore , all our tears were spent . So at last I turned away . " Do you want me to tell Nat good-bye for you ? " She asked me . " Yes , " I said , " you tell him . " I went on by myself , but when I reached the other side of the wooden bridge , something made me look back . A flash of somethingwhite showed at the upper hall window . It moved in the strong October sunshine . I reached in my pocket for my own handkerchief and waved back till my arm ached clear to the socket . Then I had to run every step of the way to the schoolhouse . All that morning I sat with a book propped open on my72 Time Out of Minddesk , but my eyes stared straight ahead of me . I saw and heard nothing , and for once the teacher spared me any questions . " Come on down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jake urged me as soon as we streamed into the yard for recess . But I shook my head and waited till they were all gone off in that direction . My head ached dully and my feet felt like clods as I went off by myself to an old pasture higher up . It was thick with juniper , and blueberry leaves were blood-red underfoot . I remember that I stooped and picked a sprig of wintergreen to chew as I went . It seemed queer that I could still taste it , yet I could . I was even hungry for the lunch in my pail , and when the bread and butter and cookies and apple were gone , I climbed higher still and sat down on a great gray outcrop of boulder , warm in the noon sun . It had burned off the fog of early morningand the sea was blue beyond the wooded points of headland . And then I saw the long , lovely shape of the " Rainbow " going out to sea , with all her new sails spread in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters ; now it looked small as its own model the Major kept on his desk . Gulls followed like a whirling fall of snow-flakes at the stern . I can see it yet as clearly as if it had been scratched with a pen point on the surface of my eleven year old mind . I had no tears or feelings left as I watched it head out between the islands . But I knew in the sudden , sure way that children do , that nothing would ever be the same again for the three of us . CHAPTER VIITHERE is little to tell of that late fall and winter . Fortune 's Folly was strangely quiet and when Rissa and I talked we found ourselves speaking in whispers as if someone had lately died . The piano was unlocked now but Rissa could not bring herself to touch it often . She shunned the east parlor , preferring the kitchen when I was about , or sitting alone in her bedroom hunched over some book . Her father did his best to please and distract her , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though she answered his questions dutifully and thanked him for the gifts he brought her , a chill of distrust had come between them . " It ai n't right for a child to hang on to a grudge so , " mother would say when Rose brought out a half touched plate to show her . " I know she was dreadful cut up over the Major sending the boy away , and I ca n't say 's I blame her . Nat 's too small and pindling for such a long voyage . They should have broke him in easy on short ones . But Rissa 's got a granite streak in her and it 's commencing to crop out . " It was no use the Major telling her that Nat would not be over worked . He explained that he had given Captain Mac Murty orders to put no heavy duties on him . Odd jobs , helping in the galley and carrying the mess out , would n't hurt , only toughen him . Even Henry Willis was called upon to reassure her . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one night after , supper . " But he 's most likely enjoying himself aboard ship by now . Lot 's of fun for a boy on a long sea voyage and once they make foreign ports he 'll have the time of his young life . " " Not Nat , " Rissa answered , and shut her lips tight . " He 's not like most boys . " 7374 Time Out of Mind " That 's just why your father sent him , " Henry Willis remindedher . " Some boys have gone younger than eleven . " " He 'd hate it if he was a hundred and eleven ! " Her eyes turned steely gray like the Major 's . They gave up arguing with her at last . Only when we two were alone would she talk freely , and then it was always of Nat . I missed him in my own way which was not her set , unrelenting sort . Mine would be sudden storms of remorse for my wn part in the affair . For I still went back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time . The Major had said he had made up his mind then and there to ship Nat off , and I could n't ever get that quite out of mind . Sometimes I had to burst out with my feelings . " You know , Rissa , " I would remind her as we sat together in her bedroom through those chill early winter twilights , " it was my place to watch for the carriage . I do n't see how I ever came to miss it that time , but still I did and so I 'm most to blame . " " I guess he 'd have sent him anyway . " Rissa tried to be kind . " I would n't mind so much if it was n't for that Captain Mac Murty . But you know he 's so big and he loves to tease . He 'll go out of his way to plague Nat . " Sometimes we pored over an old Atlas together , wondering if the " Rainbow " could have got to the Equator by then . We measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the port for the lumber . It depressed us to find how small a part of the universe the State of Maine occupied . We took to reading books together . Rissa was given to poetry about that time and one evening she fetched me upstairs to show me a passage she had found earlier in the day . I do n't remember what poem it came in , but there was mention of " white horses " in it , and from the rest of the verse we could tell that meant white capped waves . Neither of us had ever heard them called that before and we stared at one another dumbfounded . " Remember , Kate , what Old Lady Phibben told Nat about white horses that time she told his fortune ? " " Yes , " I said , trying to recollect her very words . " There wasTime Out of Mind 75something about a thin black stick , but first she said there 'd be the white horses to watch out for . They 'd try to break him , she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant , " Rissa nodded , " not real horses the way we thought , but the salt water ones . Oh , dear , I wish we 'd known before . " " It 's queer her talking like poetry . " I said . Everything we read then became related to Nat for us in some way , but a large red book we pulled out of a bottom shelf is most bound up for me with those days . We began first by poring over the engraved pictures , most of which had to do with a great ship , fully rigged , and her crew of strange and bearded men . One of them had wilder eyes than the rest and a huge white bird dangled from his neck . Every page we turned the pictures grew more frightening , and yet we could not keep from looking . The icicles on the rigging and the driving snow sent shivers down our spines , and it was worse later on when the crew turned to spectres with staring eyes in ghostly sockets . " Oh , Rissa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed coiling snakes and sea-monsters , " Oh , Rissa , it 's awful ! " And then she read me all about it . I can never hear a driven northeast rain at the windows without remembering those picturesand Rissa 's voice reading " The Rime of the Ancient Mariner " . We quaked together and drew closer , and still we must keep on to the end , as if the old man 's glittering eye was upon us right there in Fortune 's Folly. " 0 , Wedding Guest , this soul hath beenAlone on a wide , wide sea , So lonely ' t was that God himself Scarce seemed there to be . " Even now as I set the words down on the page before me , my heart knocks at my ribs as it did that day I first heard them . " Oh , God , " I prayed alone in bed that night , remembering , " do n't let Nat feel like that , do n't let him please . Amen . " ii76 Time Out of MindI was to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a long and bitter cold one , with such storms of freezing sleet that I was often away from school for days on end . I was much alone then , for in December Major Fortune took Rissa by the packet to Boston . From there they went on to spend Christmas with the Philadelphia relatives . Rissa was to remain till Spring . The Major thought it high time she attended a young ladies ' finishing school and dancing classes . He counted on this change and new companionship to rouse her from her grim listlessness . Nat 's frailness only caused him annoyanceand humiliation , but Rissa 's lack of appetite and spirit were on his mind . " She 'll pick up in a milder place , " I heard him telling mother . " Her Aunt wants her to know more young girls , and I can fetch her back in May or June . " Rissa made no protests , though she would have preferred not to go . " I 'll write you , Kate , " she said at parting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't touch a thing in Nat 's room and mine . " After she went away , looking so beautiful in a brown beaver cap the color of her hair , and her green broadcloth coat , it was quieter than ever for me . The arrival of the big leather mail sack each evening became the most important event of each day , for shortly before Christmas there was a package and letter from Rissa . It was the first I had ever had all to myself and it lies before me now , the letters set down in her neat , fine handwriting . " Dear Kate : Father and I got here day before yesterday , and this morning Aunt Esther and my cousins took me shopping . The stores here are enormousand we got presents for everybody and I bought this collar for you to wear on your plaid dress . Lace collars are very stylish here , also bangles and Roman sashes . I have one that looks like a rainbow , but the stripes go the wrong way , and I wish it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Time Out of Mind 77Father got a report from Captain Mac Murty from Bordeaux , and he says everything is all right , but he has had a time with Nat . 0 dear , I had to cry when he told me and when we went to church and the big organ played and I had to cry into my muff because I got wanting Nat to hear it too . I start in at the Academy for young ladies after New Year 's . My cousins go to it , but they know everyone there already and I do n't yet . Please see that nobody breaks the vase with the china lamb on it in my room and be careful about dusting Nat 's things . Merry Christmas and happy new year fromClarissa Fortune . " I sent her a handkerchief case that mother helped me sew , and I wrote to her too . But I did n't know where to send a letter to Nat . He was in my mind on Christmas eve when mother and I went to stay with the Jordan cousins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit up a little by then . I helped Jake pick nut meats and make a snow man for the front yard , and it was fun when he took me sliding on his bob-sled . " You 're a lot nicer when those Fortunes are away , " he told me with his widest grin , " I hope they do n't come back again and stuff your head with fool notions . " " I like their notions , Jake Bullard , " I answered him back . " You 've got no call to make remarks about Nat and Rissa when they 're my best friends . " " You 'd better not say that in front of Sam Jordan , " he warned me . " He 's down on the whole lot of ' em . " Before we returned to The Folly I knew that was the truth . Cousin Sam Jordan was so bitter that even mother told George on the way home she guessed the accident had turned him sour . Nat 's letter to me came the last day of the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the east parlor and stared at my name in his funny , crooked writing and all the queer colored foreign stamps . There was just light enough left for me to make out the penciled letters that are even fainter now as I copy them down. 78 Time Out of Mind " Dear Kate , Everybody on bord is writing letters to send off by a sterner when we get to Bordo tomorro maybe . Jim Jarvis from Little Prospect let me have his pencil and - gaper while he is up on watch , so I will write to you and Rissa . He was good to me when I was sea sick at first , so was Torn Rice . I am better now but my hands pretty sore from the ropes , and I have blisters to . I can clime to the yard arms and not get very dizzy , but I do nt like it or carrying food out in bad weather . There are rats on bord and I have tamed one . He comes when I whisel a tune I made up and give him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks like Miss Ada Joy his nose is so long and his eyes little and blinky . I do wish I was home again . They say Indyer will be hot as blazes , but Jim says you can buy bamboo pipes to play on there . I want one only my fingers have got pretty stiff . I miss Rissa and I miss you too and this is all the paper I can find so good-bye fromNat . " Mother was calling me from the kitchen as I put the letter in my pocket and left the east parlor . It was striking six by the French enamel clock and I stopped to see the little figures come out and pull away with their cross-saw at the log that was n't really there . When they would do it twelve times it would be another year . I thought how strange it was that years came and went like that , and it seemed to me suddenly that perhaps they were like the clock 's unseen log that fell away , like time itself , under the woodsmen 's cross-saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found a few late blooming pink lady slippers in the woods and had them in her favorite vase , and I carried in great armsful of white and purplelilacs for the Chinese jars in the hall . I waited by the steps in my new blue denim long before the packet whistled off the Narrows . But when the carriage actually drew up I turned shy and awkward and could barely muster a faint " Hello " when Rissa stepped out . She looked taller and much more grown up in the gray and cherry outfit that was of the latest fashion and far beyond Miss Addie 's powers of creation . Even when she exchangedit later for last year 's challis , I found her somehow unfamiliar . Her hair was tied back now , though it was as soft and curling , and her laugh was altogether different from the one she had taken away with her . She used queer expressions that I had never heard before . " You do n't say " , and " Pardon me " and " My heaven 's above " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never manage to say them as she did any more than I could learn the waltz and those other dance steps she could do so easily . Only when we talked of Nat were we back upon the old footing , and we talked of him for hours on end those first days . " He 's been sick , you know , " Rissa told me with a little worriedfrown . " Captain Mac Murty wrote father , but he said he was better again . It was some kind of a fever . " " I had a letter from him , " I said , " but it was way back last Christmas . I hope he got that pipe to play on . When 'll the Rainbow ' be back ? " " Father is n't sure . He keeps saying a month and then it gets798o Time Out of Mindto be two months and now he thinks not till late August or Septembermaybe . " " But that 'll be a whole year since the launching , " I reminded her . " He 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by little from Henry Willis and the Major we learned there had been difficulties aplenty on the homeward voyage . First trouble with her rudder in a tropical gale , and then a long delay putting in at some remote islands for repairs . This and an unaccountable leak in the hold , had caused considerable damage to the cargo of valuable merchandise she was bringing back . Major Fortune was worried by every fresh bit of news he got and no wonder . I had grown to evade the sly questions Jake and the others put to me about the return . Bad news always gets about and there were plenty to carry the gossip from ship-yard to village . The lumber mill was busy , but shipping slack , and when Henry Willis or the Major went to Boston on business neither returned in a cheerful frame of mind . " But everything 's bound to be all right once the Rainbow ' gets back , " I told myself all through that long summer . Even in late August when the word came that she was in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents there , it seemed she would never come . There were further repairs needed , and Rissa and I grew despairing . Still , it was something to see her name in the fine printed columns of shipping news the Major 's newspaper carried . " Seem 's if they 're spell-set for sure , " I told Rissa in mother 's best style . " Some say it 's on account of that accident at the launching . You know how they said she was bound for trouble . " But Rissa would n't hear of such notions . " It stands to reason , " she reproved me , " that one man getting hit with a block could n't bring them bad luck way off the other side of the globe . " She looked a lot like the Major when she said that . But I was n't so sure . I had heard too many stories from Jake and George and others that winter not to feel queer about it . Rissa pleaded to go to Boston with her father and Henry WilTimeOut of Mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " there and return on the final lap . But they would n't hear of it , so she had to wait at The Folly with me for the great return . She came in at last under full press of sail on the first morningof September . George sighted her before breakfast while she was still only a speck on the horizon . He was coming from the barn with brimming milk pails in either hand . He set them down so hard the milk spilled over , but he could only think of getting to the cupola to ring the bell that had always clanged to announce returning Fortune vessels . It 's sudden peal brought us all out of our rooms . Rissa and I stood on the landing in our long nightgowns . " She 's back , Kate ! She 's back ! " " She looks to be most to Heron Island now , " I squinted against the early light . " But there 's a big stretch of water betweenthat and Old Horse Ledges . " " She 'll make it fast with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm going to harness the horses right off . " He had promised to take us with him and we were into our clothes with a hastily swallowed breakfast before he had brought the carriage round . Fancy and Fanny were full of spirit as they took the ups and downs of the road , but not so full of it as we two beside George on the high front seat . Sometimes when the spruce woods shut us in for a mile or more and we lost sight of those far topsails , we could scarcely contain our impatience till we sighted her again at the peak of the next steep rise . Presently we heard the bells in the steeples of the Baptist and Congregationalchurches sending out stirring clangs on the salt air . " Fit to raise the dead , " George chuckled as we passed the oldest burying ground with its scattered , tilting stones . " Still , " he added , " it ai n't much like the days when there was two maybe three anchored off shore , unloading or waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along our way . They were full of questions and comments as to the probable time she would make . Men were eut in large numbers by the saw-mill82 Time Out of Mindand later at the post-office . But we kept on down to the wharf . George put the horses in a nearby barn , and we followed him . There were plenty of warm kitchens where we might have waited , but neither of us could bear the thought of watching from behind a pane of window glass . We found a corner , shelteredfrom the keen morning wind , on the Fortune wharf . A pile of lumber made us a seat , and George came back to keep an eye on us every once in so often . Already several boatloads of men were preparing to go out to meet the " Rainbow " . Every skiff and dory in the Harbor was filling up . I saw Jake Bullard in one with some older boys and waved to him . I thought that perhaps if I had been alone he would have smuggled me along . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the long months away in Philadelphia seemed to drop from Rissa and for that hour we were as we had been a year before . The " Rain .. bow " was tacking in through the difficult channel between the islands . We could see her plainly now , and her sails were no longer new and shining . Patches of lighter canvas showed jaggedlyon more than one of the dingy , wind-curved sheets . " She do n't look the same ship that went out , " I said to Rissa with a sudden pang , for never before had I seen with my own eyes the change that time and buffetings can work on paint and canvas . Just for a moment I felt my throat tighten , and something I could n't put into words took me , even there in the joy of waiting to welcome Nat home again . But it was no time for such thoughts with the long prow pointing into the nearer channel . Now dark dots appeared in the rigging , and I marvelled that these should be men , who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hailing families and neighbors as they came . George joined us again , shading his eyes against the sun that glittered in broken brightness on every lifting wave . " Making it pretty , she is , " he said approvingly . " A couple more tacks and she 'll be past the black buoy . By Godfrey , I 'd like to be aboard her this minute ! " Now we lost all but her topsails as she dropped behind LittleTime Out of Mind 83Heron Island . It was strange to see them moving so , above the ranks of dark tipped trees . " Look , " I whispered to Rissa , " it kind of puts me in mind of the pictures in that Ancient Mariner ' book . " She nodded and her hands were clenched and chill to my touch . Then the prow pointed past the last rocks , and she came round to the mouth of the Harbor with a great flapping and rattling of canvas as she shifted sail . We could hear it plainly , we and the others who had gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if all of us there must have a part in the heart-lifting stir . Nearer and nearer she bore into the Harbor , the sun on every taut line and straining sheet . All the small craft stood off to give her room , even the crowded skiffs kept proper distance as was fitting so proud a return . Anchor chains rattled . Canvas flapped and grew lax , and the group on shore and those in the boats broke into cheers that went out , thin and shrill across the narrow stretch of water . Other shouts came from those on deck to those in the nearer boats . We could scarcely stand still in our impatience . Now that she was in at last and almost within a stone 's throw of us , it seemed that sails would never be furled or the little moving figures clamber down into the boats that clustered about the battered , green-filmed hull . " Seem 's if they 'll never come ashore , " Rissa sighed . " Why do n't they hurry , George ? " " Got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fifteen minutes do n't make much difference when you 've been out a year . " " But that 's just why "  --  Rissa broke off to wave her handkerchieffrantically to the first boat starting back . We got as close as we could to a wooden ladder that let down from the wharf to the water . The tide was in , it would be an easy climb . As the first boat came nearer we could make out Captain Mac Murty 's big shape in the stern , and the Major 's gray coat among the blue of the men . But there was no sign of Nat. 84 Time Out of Mind " Oh , dear , " Rissa was almost crying with impatience , " I think father might have let him come in the first load ! " Everyone crowded so close to the landing place that we were pushed back by larger bodies and even George was too eager to help us . Suddenly we heard George call out :  --  " Hi , Major , here we be ! " And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make room for him . In another moment I knew why they had done so . He stepped slowly from the ladder , holding what looked like a bundle of blankets in his arms . Even as I stared , wondering that he should do such a thing , I saw the white triangle of Nat 's face looking out from it . There was not room for me in the carriage , so I had to trudge the three miles back to The Folly on foot and alone . I hardly knew how I went for my head was full of scraps I had heard on every side as I went through Little Prospect . The first boatload had n't been ashore ten minutes before everyone knew that Nat Fortune was a very sick boy . I listened whenever I caught his name even though my feet were hurrying past every group by post office and doorsteps . Yes , they said , the doctor in Boston had told the Major Nat would have to be kept quiet in bed for months if his heart was to right itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard one of the blue-coated men tell several women who questioned him with concerned headshakes . " He was n't bigger'n a spindle to start with , " they reminded one another , " and now look at him . He 'd have to stand up twice to make a shadow . " " The Major acted scared for once the time he come aboard and saw him . " Another man put in . " No wonder , " chimed in one of the women , " he 'll never raise him for the shipping or any other business . " " He 'd better watch out that name he 's so sot on the boy carryingon ai n't on a tombstone by Spring . I do n't care what any Boston doctor says he 's got the look right in his eyes , same 's his mother had the last time I seen her . " " Tom Rice says it 's all the Captain 's doing . Says he dosedTime Out of Mind 85him wrong time the boy took sick with that tropic fever , and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tom says he used to manoeuver to save the little fellow all he could , he felt so sorry for him . " " He was too little to go on any such voyage . I said so at the time and I say so again . " I was glad to be out of the clack of their tongues and the look of their faces , and when I got to The Folly at last I felt comforted to hear Rissa playing the piano in the east parlor . " He wanted to hear me , " she told me . " Oh , Kate , he most died , and even father 's scared . " " I know , " I said , and I tried to tell her the things I had heard them saying down in the Harbor . At least I told her what the men had said . I could n't bear repeating all of it . She was frightened enough as it was . They would n't let me go near his room till supper time when I carried up his tray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very small voice from the big bed he hardly dented as he lay there . " I brought you back another knife with a pearl handle to make up for that one you gave me I lost . " " You need n't have bothered , " I told him , setting the tray down . " I 'd be glad enough to see you back without any pres-ent . " " You 've got big , " he said , his eyes staring at me hard from the whiteness of his face against the white pillows . " Your hair 'll be long enough to braid pretty soon . " It seemed wonderful to me that he should have noticed when he was as weak as all that , and I felt pleased and happier than I had been since the first boat load had come from the " Rainbow " that morning . Between us , Rissa and I coaxed him to take some soup . Turn about we fed him from the silver spoon with the curly F. on the handle . I do n't know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly there sprang up in my mind a sayingI had heard once somewhere . " That 's a spoon you 'll sup sorrow with yet ! " ItPages 86,87 DeletedCHAPTER IXTHEY say that every seven years our bodies are changed completely , and that we shuffle off our old selves as a snake its dried and done for skin . This may well be so , but though the snake shed its worn scales like a garment , there must still be the same stripes and spottings . So we kept our early markings of dispositionsand bodies for all that we three had struggled out of childhoodand were now at the end of our teens , ready to jump the gap between us and the twenties . Rissa had almost stepped into them , but she held back , as she had always done in the past , waiting for Nat to catch up to her . It seems to me now , looking back on those years , that Little Prospect also grew with us from youth to maturity , and though Major Fortune fumed and swore at each new house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop them than he could keep us children forever . The summer after Nat 's return , while he was still creeping like a frail shade about The Folly rooms and garden , several cruising parties had anchored in the Harbor . We thought little of this at the time but later it turned out that they had bought land , four or five of the finest sites on the whole coast . Trees were already being cut and foundations dug for the houses that were to stand there by another spring . The Major was in a fine temper when it came to his ears that the largest of these was going up on Porcupine Head which stood out boldly to the southwest . It was land that joined the Fortune acres and had once been fine woodland which his grandfather had cut for early timber . Not finding it of further use he had sold it to the Rice family who had lived there ever since . Major Fortune had meant to buy it back someday , but there hads490 Time Out of Mindseemed no need of haste till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lost to him and the offers he made were curtly refused . " It 's scandalous , " I heard him tell Henry Willis as he sorted his mail one evening . " Old Dolly Rice let Porcupine and seven acres of land go to this man Drake for seven hundred dollars , and now he writes he would n't take eight thousand for it . I 've a good mind to bring him to law about it . Any court would admit I had the right to an option . " " I 'm not so certain of that , " Henry Willis warned him . " A case like that ca n't be proved and it 's sure to cost you more than it 's worth . You wo n't notice it much once the house is built and the trees grown up again . " " I do n't want Little Prospect ruined with a lot of summer visitors , " the Major reproved him . " What we 're coming to , I do n't know . Next thing someone 'll be proposing to run a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you an offer you 'd better take it , " I heard his friend answer . " I 'd rather see most anything there instead of grass and rotting wood and an office nobody comes to anymore . " The Major refused to notice this , but from the other side of the door I could see his long foot in its polished boot tap impatientlyas he went on with his reading . " I suppose you put Harding up to writing me about that lumber , " he said presently . " He says here he 's got the contract for four of the new houses ? " " No , I did n't , but he 's a smart fellow and he 'll pay you a good price . Looks to me , Nathaniel , as if you 'd better make the most of your timber even if it does go into houses instead of ships . " " Not for any of these blights they 're planning to raise round here , " the Major snapped . " I have n't come to selling my birthrightfor a mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tempora mutantur  --  " the other began , but the Major cut him short . " Yes , yes , I know ,  --  the times are changed and we are changedTime Out of Mind 9 zwith them . That 's all well enough in latin , but I mean to cling to what dignity 's left in this steam-run world ! " I slipped away from the hall without their hearing me . I knew the beginning of the Major 's favorite topic and had no wish to hear it all over again . I think I should be more patient with him now , understanding as I do the pang that comes with seeing time devour natural loveliness and the most cherished landmarks laid low in a single night . But then it was the old gulf of age between us . Rissa and Nat and I did not dread change as he did . We strained at our moorings , like ships ready to take the unknown blue . I rebelled less at staying in familiar waters . They had proud sea-faring blood in their pulses , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to sea . No , Nat had had his full share of that . Indeed he could seldom bring himself to speak of that voyage , and sometimes at a careless word or joke he would go pale and the clouded look would come over his eyes making me guess he had been reminded of the " Rainbow " and all he had endured aboard her . A small brown dog had followed him back from the vessel and refused to leave his bedside those low months before he could be up and about . Frisky , he called her , and once when we were alone he told me how he had found her in a strange port and smuggled her aboard and fed her bits of food from the galley . But Captain Mac Murty had found out and seized her . " He took her by the scruff of the neck , " he told me , " and hove her right over into the harbor . She swam round and round the ship , crying . She 'd have gone down only for Tom Rice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of set-to afterwards about it . " His eyes darkened with such hatred when he spoke that I was frightened even there with the little dog safe against my knee . That voyage had changed Nat , but not in the way his father had meant it to . It was his feelings and will that were toughened , not the light shell of his body . But even when the doctors made it plain that Nat would never be able to go to sea or do the sort of work he had planned92 Time Out of Mindfor the boy , his father kept on trying to turn him into the son he wanted . So , from the time he recovered and could be about again , Major Fortune set out to make a scholar of him . " We 'll put a spur in the boy 's head if he ca n't have one in his heels , " he said , and from that day Nat had a string of tutors to cram him full of learning . A frail body would be no handicap in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Judge , in command of a courtroom , instead of a quarterdeck . Nat took it quietlyenough . He had learned by now that open rebellion would gain him nothing . " I 've got plans of my own , " he used to tell us sometimes . " You two just wait and see . " The piano was no longer forbidden to him provided he did not let it interfere with his studies . Sometimes , when he would have set-backs and be propped up in bed for weeks at a time with fever and what the doctors called " heart murmurs " , he could not go to the east parlor . Then he would scrape away at an old fiddle we found in the attic or play on the bamboo pipe he had brought from an eastern port . I never tired of hearing him call music out of this , particularly one tune which he had heard boatmen play as they passed in their flat bottomed boats . " The Muddy River Song " we always called it after he told us about the brown water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark sails . To me it is still the loneliest tune I have ever heard , the most plaintive and sad . Sometimes when I asked him for it he would laugh and tease me for leaning to sorrow . I marvel now that it should have meant anything to me then . But youth is a time when we know so little and can feel so much . It was as if something deep within my young flesh answered that music that was so infinitely old and sad and wise . It was like a warning in me that said : " Listen well , for some day you will know the meaning of this . " And then I would run out into the orchard maybe , to bring in red and yellow apples , or pick wild strawberries in the meadows , or help with the churning , and feel the free strength of my arms and back , and the swelling of my breasts , and my feetTime Out of Mind 93stepping so light and sure in my scuffed shoes , that I would forgetall but my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colt turned out to pasture in Spring and shake my thick braids and even sing a snatch of tune in the low , mumbling way I had that Nat said was like bees , nuzzling into a clover clump . I was too healthy a creature not to be mostly careless and hopeful . I was confident in my own vigor , and my wits were not yet sharpened by love or physical pain . Now as I hold the small faded picture of us in my hands and let the late light that comes up from the sea , rather than down from the sky , touch our three faces once more , I can see how even then I was of different stuff from those other two . Not that I am belittling my young self , for now that I am old and changed I do not think it is vain of me to say that I was pleasant to look upon . But I was a rooted thing always , with my feet firm on brown earth . With my sandy colored hair and freckles , and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange visitor , Dick Halter , said I was most like a russet apple tree in fall . He came to tutor Nat the summer before he went away to college , and it was he who took the photograph of us , the only one in which we three were together . Rissa was just nineteen that summer , and I nearing eighteen with my school days behind me and a broad smile of contentmenton my lips . He took the picture of us in the garden on the stone bench by the syringa bushes . Rissa 's lap was full of their four petalled stars and I held a great bunch in my arms . Nat sat between us with the little dog Frisky between his knees . It was a warm June day and Rissa and I in cool dresses , hers of white dimity and mine of stouter gingham . Frisky 's tongue would keep lolling out of her mouth , and the hair on Nat 's foreheadstill shows in damp , flattened points . He was the youngest of us , and yet I can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his full lips were smiling , his eyes kept the grave , deep look that he never lost after he came back from that year at sea . I know now that pain and a too early knowledge of the ways of men put it there . The same dark brooding look I found in the94 Time Out of Mindpicture of a dead poet whose name was Edga . Allan Poe . It troubled me to read what manner of man he was and of the demon of music that had possessed him also . It is a better likeness of Rissa than of either Nat or me and there was reason in this . To Dick Halter she became the center of every picture from the first day he set foot in Fortune 's Folly . " He 's not so much to look at , " Nat told me the day Dick Halter arrived . " But he can stand up to father and he 's fallen for Rissa already . " " Does she like him ? " I kindled to the possibility of romance . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back at me , " she 'd never let on , but I can tell she likes him better than any of the other tutors or the beaux she danced with in Philadelphia last Christmas . " " Is he old , Nat ? " " Twenty three , and he 's going to be a painter . He wants to go and study in Paris . Father told him he was a fool to waste his time on such nonsense . But he did n't mind . He just laughed and said every man to his own taste ' . " Dick Halter did wonders for Nat that summer , indeed he was good for us all . He was such a plain , shabby young man and so solid and slow moving . Yet he had a curious force and energy that one felt , even from his first , strong handshake . He had been poor all his life and he had the easy adaptability of one who had had to fit himself into the lives and ways of others . He liked comforts and good food as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for months on end . Even then he showed traces of the power and perseverance that his good nature hid at first meeting . He was like the iceberg I had read about in my geography , only showing a fraction of itself above water . But there was nothing cold about him . He was one of the most warmhearted , generous creatures alive . Nat 's quickness and changing moods were like flint to his steel , and his pleasant patience seemed to put some kind of spell on the high-strung , excitable boy . Perhaps they got on so well because they were each conTimeOut of Mind 95sumed with a desire to make something ,  --  Dick Halter with his , brushes and paint , and Nat with keys and fiddle strings and'those black notes and bars he was forever setting on paper . I I Other tutors had tried to keep Nat from his music and so hadset up a wall between him and his studies , but this young man urged him to his books that they might have more time for what they each wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in the three years before . The Major was doubtfulof the method , but he could n't deny the results . He admitted Dick Halter 's ability though he deplored his misguided notions , and when the portrait of Rissa was begun , even he was partly won over . During those first weeks of his stay Dick Halter contented himself with filling notebooks full of sketches in pencil or rough crayon colors , pictures of anything and everything he saw . He did trees and wharves and islands and ships , but it was n't long before we found out that people were what really mattered to him . It seemed queer to me to see how quickly he would work , with broad , rough lines and patches of color . But when he was done ,  --  there I would be maybe picking cherries , halfway up a ladder , or churning in the springhouse , or hulling berries on the back porch . I have some of these little pictures yet that he gave me . They tell me that if he had bothered to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price because they show how even in his early work he struck out for himself , not trying to copy the ways of other painters . We often teased him about this and I remember I asked him once why he did n't take more pains to make his things look like the pictures in books or on The Folly walls . " If you did , " I told him in my young ignorance , " then perhapspeople would buy them and you could make a lot of money . " He shook his head . " You see , Kate , " he explained , " there would n't be any use in that . I must paint things the way they look to me . If I saw a1lPages 96 , 97 Deleted98 Time Out of Mindher wear a last year 's dress which had faded to a faint cream from its earlier yellow . When he had got a little way along I saw why he had chosen it to bring out her own clearness of face that a brighter tint would have spoiled . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of a well , or in the green twilightof a very old wood . " Portrait of a young woman in summer " he called it when he had it hung in his exhibition years later . It was noticed and remarked upon there among the pictureshe had learned to paint with greater skill . Yes , Dick Halterpainted better than he knew . I could have cried when I came upon a blurred , newspaper print of it and saw Rissa again as she had been that summer , looking out in all her soft young dignity and grace . If you have ever seen a green leaf bright against its own shadow , you will know how Rissa looked on that square of canvas . That was the summer of 1885 and just before Nat left for his first year at Harvard their Aunt Esther Marlin and her daughters , Jane and Bessie , came to visit at The Folly . The Major took it into his head to give an evening reception during their stay . It was partly in their honor , but I think more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's high time you came out , " he told her one evening as I brought in the lamps to the east parlor after supper , " and your aunt agrees with me . She 'll be here in time to make the arrangements . We 'll show some of these summer folks we know how to entertain as well as they do in New York and Philadelphia . By Jove , we 'll make them sit up and take notice ! " " How about some music , Sir ? " Nat was eager . " Music ? Certainly . " For once his father accepted the suggestion . " We 'll have the piano tuned and the harp strung and get some players down from Portland . You young fry can dance in the east parlor ,  --  no , better have a tent on the lawn . I , ll get them to bring canvas from the ship-yard . There 's plenty stored there . Henry 's off to Boston next week so you 'd better write out a list of what you want . Nat 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Esther to bring Rissa 's dress . " Time Out of Mind 99 " Will my portrait be done in time ? " She asked Dick . " It would look nice hanging over there across from mother 's . " " I have n't any frame , " he told her . " They cost a lot , and besides ,  --  " He reddened suddenly looking down at his shabby clothes , " you see , I have n't a black suit , so maybe I 'd better not be round . " " Nonsense ! " Rissa cried . " We would n't have a party without you . " " And Kate , too , " Nat gave me one of his quick looks . " We 'll have to teach them to dance between us . " It was easier to find a frame in the attic for the portrait than to make dancers of us . Still , Nat and Rissa persisted , and we learned to fit our feet to the beat of a waltz and a two-step . First Nat would thump out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the hall , calling out her **26;2895;TOOLONG as they went . Then she would take the piano and Nat would have a turn with me . " I can do it all right alone , Nat , " I told him after one particularlypoor round , " but somehow I ca n't seem to fit my feet to yours . " " I know , " he laughed good naturedly . " You dance sort of like a tree or a bush trying to . Now Dick 's just plain clumsy , and you 're not . You just have to go your own way I guess . " Somehow I could n't mind he was so pleasant about it . But there was no time for such goings-on once their Aunt Esther and the two Philadelphia cousins arrived . I remembered her with dread , and my feelings had not changed with the years . I was setting a jar of dahlias in the hall when the carriage drew up and she bore down on us all like a human ship under full press of sail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beads flashed on her full bosom and in her ears under the small , stiff hat . I might have been the newel post for all the notice she took of me standing there . " Mercy , Nathaniel , " I heard her exclaim to the Major as she swept into the parlor , " I do n't know how you expect to make this place presentable in a week . Everything looks old enoughi oo Time Out of Mind Time Out of Mind i o ito have come out of the Ark . That 's what comes of leaving things to a housekeeper . You would n't know a chair needed fixing till it fell under you I suppose . " I hurried back to the kitchen to report the arrival to mother and Rose , glad indeed that they had not been within hearing . " That woman 's a slave driver , I can tell from one look , " Rose said as we washed and dried the supper dishes later . Her predictions were right and it was n't long before the Major'ssister had put us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem pleasant and easy-going by comparison and by the end of her first day mother and Rose and Annie Button were in open mutiny . The Folly looked as if a cyclone had struck it with curtainsdown , carpets being turned and beaten , and furniture all shifted about . Nothing had been changed for years in the great rooms , and since there was not time to renew the covers of chairs and sofas , all hands were pressed into turning the green damask . Even the flighty Jane and the plump Bessie were put to odd bits of sewing , over which they frowned and took on as if they were being worn to the bare bone . Their presence and their mother 's changed the household as completely as if a keg of dynamitehad been set off in our midst . I think I should not have minded it so much except that Nat and Dick Halter took themselves and their books to the boathouse through the whole week of preparation . That left the three girls and the Major 's sister in full sway , and Rissa hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suddenly I found myself an outsider , who belonged by rights in kitchen and pantry . I had been so familiar in my comings and goings , so one with the two young Fortunes , that it came as a shock to my seventeen year old pride . I could n't bring myself to speak of it to mother who was put-out enough as it was . " I 'm like to die and be buried before this week 's out , " she complained to Rose as they got down china and glass that had n't been off the top shelves for years , and polished dozens of silver spoons . " And not a please or a thank-you in the lot of them . " " That bold-faced pair do n't deserve to get husbands , " Rosechimed in . " You 'd ought to see the state the spare room 's in . They step out of their silk skirts and leave ' em like birds ' nests anywhere , and the top part clear across the room like as not . " " I hope they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mother exclaimed . " She 's got plenty as it is . " " There 's a pile knee deep on the floor , " Rose went on , " left for me to pick up and wash and iron . But I stood right up to them about it . I have n't a minute to spare from now to the party , I said , and you 'd ought to have seen the looks they give me . " " Now , Kate , " mother cautioned me , " do n't you go making yourself an easy mark . That pair 'll ride over you rough shod if you do n't watch out . " " All they 've got in their headpieces are fancy rigs and beaux , " Annie put in from the ell where she was kneading bread . " They 've got George most crazy taking the horses out any time of day , now when he needs ' em for errands . They 're a caution , those two . " " Worse'n all the summer company , part and parcel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if she were wiping the whole tribe off the face of the earth . Later that morning when I went upstairs with fresh towels I heard the girls ' voices coming from Rissa 's room . " Mother says it 's a disgrace to have servants who do n't know their places . " Bessie said in her lazy drawl . " She says they alwaysget the upper hand when there is n't a mistress over them . " " Of course , " Jane put in , exactly copying her mother 's crisp tones , " it 's too late to do much with the old ones . They 're too spoiled by now , but mother says it 's a great mistake treating that girl as if she was just like you and Nat . " The color flooded over my face and neck as I waited there on the hall landing for Rissa 's reply . " Well , but Kate is n't a servant exactly , " I heard her hedging . " Her mother 's your housekeeper , is n't she ? " Jane insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Philadelphia . We'veknown her ever since we were little , and she can read and write1 o2 Time Out of Mind Time Out of Mind 103and ,  --  and everything . She might even get to be a school teacher I guess , if she wanted to . " I could tell Rissa felt uneasy and wanted to change the subject , but the other two were determined to keep her to it . " When people work for you , they 're servants . " Although I could not see into the room I knew how Bessie folded her lips over that last statement . " You ought not to let her call you by your first name any more . " Rissa said nothing in answer and Jane followed up her sister 's words . " She 's got the makings of a good lady 's maid , mother says , if you took her in hand right now before she gets spoiled like the rest . We 're going to have one between us next winter when we come out and go to the Assemblies . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them by her admiration . " I thought girls did n't , not all to themselves I mean , till after they got married . " This started another subject , one to which I was already growing familiar . " And mother says you 'd better make the most of these summerpeople . It 's about your only chance of a good catch way off here unless you have a season with us or one in Boston . Those Drakes who built the big house on the next point are rolling in money and the son we met down in the village yesterday was n't half bad looking . " Rissa laughed . " He 's as stupid as a crab , " she told them . " I 've heard all his stories ten times over . I know when he opens his mouth what 's going to come out of it . " " You 're a fool to waste your time on Nat 's tutor . " There was no love lost between Bessie Marlin and Dick Halter as I well knew . " His clothes look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't see that he says anything worth listening to , so you need n't be so snippy about Will Drake . " " Yes , " Jane 's voice came in a shrill echo of her sister 's , " he 's dull as ditchwater . I do n't care if he did paint your portrait . It'snot much to look at and I would n't marry an artist for anything and be poor all the rest of my life . " " Oh , goodness , " I heard Rissa sigh , " Who said I was going to marry him ? I never thought of such a thing . I do n't think he cares about anything but his painting and besides I 'm too young . " " You 're nineteen next week , " Bessie pointed out firmly , " and that 's plenty old enough . I 'd die if I was n't engaged by the time I 'm twenty . " " She 's had two proposals already , and I 've practically had one . " I turned away knowing that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I could n't put all that I had heard out of my mind as I went about tidying up their room . It was as Rose had said , clothes strewn in every direction . I stooped and gathered up the bits of underwear that were finer than any I had ever seen , much less touched . Bessie had left her green taffeta flung over a chair and I stood over it a long time . It was a soft , rich green and the full skirt billowed out the way young spruces grow , thick to the roots . It had narrow bands of black velvet at the sleeves and little black bows like dark butterflies all down the front . I do n't know how it was , for I 'd never bothered much about what I put on my own back , but I felt a queer hankering after that green dress she had n't even bothered to hang up in the wardrobe . When I got back to my own room again I stood by my bed and looked at the dotted white muslin mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was spread out there with the new blue sash , and my best black slippers with the shiny bows . Somehow nothing looked right to me anymore . I kept going over and over what I had heard on the upper landing , and though I told myself I did n't care what those two silly girls said , still , I knew I did . It was n't that I had ever set myself up to be like Nat and Rissa . I 'd always known they were different craft from me and heading for different waters . But we 'd beet so close and shared so much those seven years that I 'd expectedI oq . Time Out of Mindit would always be so . I could n't help wishing Rissa had spoken back to them and said we were friends and always would be . I felt sure Nat would have said so and I wished he 'd been there . For the first time I began to know what Jake Bullard had meant by the things he said about the summer people ; why he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll give myself airs , too , someday , " he had said to me only the week before when he brought a load of clams up in his boat and we stopped to talk . " I tell you it makes me sick to hear the rusticators ' call us natives ' . I 'll show ' em someday . " I heard the dinner bell ringing and on my way downstairs again I stood a minute by the mirror in the upper hall . I think it was the first time I had ever looked at myself as if I were somebody else and not Kate Fernald that everyone knew and took for granted . Mother had been pleased with my looks of late and had said more than once that I 'd turned out better than she 'd expected . I was n't slim and graceful like Rissa and never would be . Still , neither was I plump and stuffed looking like Bessie , or scrawny like Jane . Maybe I was too tall and broad shouldered , but I stood straight on my long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My old blue cotton dress made my eyes look bluer than they really were and I had the freckles that go with sandy hair , even if mine had grown out into thick chestnut braids that wound twice round my head . My mouth turned up like a Jack-O-Lantern , I decided , staring hard at my reflection , but my teeth were strong and even when I smiled . Standing there alone with myself in the hall , I remembered Major Fortune 's words on our first meeting ,  --  " A square-rigged girl and no mistake ! " and the old hurt , self-consciousness came over me again . I wondered if I looked like a servant , the way those two had said . I thought as I turned away at last , that I might screw up courage to ask Dick Halter that . He 'd be the only one I was sure would tell me the truth , for I would n't dare mention it to mother or Jake and Nat would n't want to hurt my feelings . But I had no more time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 105for overhearing things not meant for my ears . Those next three days were a frenzy of preparation and I forgot everything in the excitement of seeing crates unpacked and boxes and bales arrivingby the packet . The tent went up like a huge white toadstool on the lawn and the first Japanese lanterns I had ever set eyes on were hung the last thing before sundown of the great day . For all their complainings mother and Rose and Annie got into the spirit of things and outdid themselves on the cold spread in the dining room . I think now that their festive spirits may have been brought about by early samplings of the punch the Major had prepared with his own hands and sundry bottles brought up from the cellar . It looked wonderful in the great silver punch bowl with sprigs of mint floating on top and an island of ice in the middle . There were other bottles being chilled and watched over by Bo in his best suit and two men from Portland had come along with the musicians and mysterious kegs that Nat told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He stayed with the musiciansfrom the minute they arrived . There were no lessons that day and he knew his father was in a good humor . He tried pickingout tunes on one man 's fiddle and he was all for having them play a Chopin piece from Rissa 's music book . I ca n't remember sitting down to a meal all that day and I know my head felt light and queer when I went up at last to get into my finery . It was a still , clear night ,  --  not a hint of fog over the easterly islands and Whale Back Light bright across the Narrows . Though it was early September the air was soft and warm as August , only the crickets ' greater clamor and the earlier fall of darkness marked the season . Several boats full of guests from Rockland and along the coast had already anchored in the inlet , their lanterns like fallen stars . The little dog Frisky had been underfoot all day and just as I was standing on tip toe to see myself in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went to open it , my hair not yet pinned up and my dress only buttoned as far as I could reach up the back . And there was Nat smiling behind the dog , already dressed in his new evening clothes . I stood stock still to see himr o6 Time Out of Mind Time Out of Mind 107so changed ,  --  a young man suddenly for all he was so slight and boyish . He looked like one of those old silhouettes in the wide frames that hung in the lower hall ,  --  all black and white . All at once he seemed to me a finished person , so clear , and pale and strange that I felt half afraid as I stared . " I 'm glad I struck you dumb , Kate , " he said . " Bessie and Jane did n't think so much of me , but then they 're after bigger fish tonight . " He had n't been in my room for months and I felt shy having him there with me . He had come to beg me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise and music . " Leave your handkerchief with her , " I told him . " She 'll be easier with something of yours to worry and sniff at . I expect , " I added , " she 's going to take on something fearful when you 're off to college next week . " His eyes darkened at that and I was sorry I had reminded him of it . " I wish I was n't going , " he said slowly , still leaning against the door frame and making no move to go . " Dick Halter 's lucky . Nobody to stop him from going off to Paris and doing what he wants to do . I wish I were going there with him . " " Then I wish you were , " I said , " though it 's a dreadful long way off . " He gave a short sigh and shrugged his shoulders in the way he had . " Turn round , Kate , " he said . " I can do those buttons you ca n't reach between your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It seemed queer to have him do such a thing for me , and yet right , too . I was mortally afraid mother might come by and think I 'd been putting him up to it . She had prim notions about such things . " You look nice , " he told me when he had finished . " It seems funny , does n't it , that we 're all three grown up now and Rissa having a reception and all ? " " Yes , " I confided to him , " every time I pin up my hair Ithink I 'm just dressing up and playing at being a lady the way we did rainy days in the attic . " " I like yours this way . " He took one of my braids in his hands . " It 's so long and straight and shining . " " I 'd lots rather it was curly and brown like Rissa 's , " I said , though I was pleased at his compliment all the same . " We 'll have our dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to jig-it with all the girls I see sitting down first . Aunt Esther made me promise , and she 'll see I do my duty . But I 'll sneak out when I can . You be on the look-out . " He went down the hall whistling and my fingers were all thumbs as I set the pins in my hair and tied my sash . I always felt different with Nat , happy and secure , as if we were the only two people in the world . It was like the old days when we sat close together over the green-backed copy of Hans Andersen , with anything , maybe , going to happen , but not too soon . I lost the feeling once I shut the door on Frisky and went downstairs . No one was about in the hall and parlors and it seemed like a strange house to me , with all the furniture pushed back against the walls . It was as if the world outside had crowded them out of their familiar places . Somehow I could n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , it came over me with a sort of chill that I was only part of the furnishing of that place , no more than one of the chairs or sofas or tables . As I fled from the house and that thought , I ran into Dick Halter . His kind , keen eyes and shabby suit cheered me and we went together to see the lighted tent . All the Japanese lanterns had bloomed miraculously into colored flowers , sprung into beingwithout root or branch . From the dark garden I could smell marigolds and dahlias , and the air that came up from the water was faintly damp with weeds and salt . In the tent the musicians were tuning their strings with a soft , fitful twanging that put me in mind of larger crickets than those in the grass underfoot . And then as we reached one of the openings in the canvas those four inside bent themselves to strings and keys and began to try over one of the waltzes . I knew the rhythm well from108 Time Out of Mindhaving heard it thumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I had ever heard it mount , singing and sweet , from harp and fiddle strings . As if in answer to a signal Rissa and Nat appeared from the other side of the tent , and without haste or hesitation , stepped out on the floor to dance . Like figures in a dream they moved effortlessly . It was as if the music were some lovely essence that they themselves gave out to the night air . Rissa was all in pale pink , her full skirts fluted like the drifts of bloom on a flowering almond bush . The warm , colored light of the lanternsfell on her bare arms and neck . There was a look of grave delight on her lips and wide open eyes . Beside her Nat seemed more than ever slight and dark , as if he were the stem and she the flower . Indeed they seemed not to be two separate persons , but a single being . I sensed , rather than felt , that they were so for as long as the music played . Neither smiled nor spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could have reached out my hand and touched them . It seemed to me then that some secret current guided their bodies ; as if the moon compelled them as it did the tide . It was too beautiful to last . I knew it even as I watched from the outer darkness . I told myselfthat it must come to an end , but I said it the way we say sometimes , " I , too , must die " , only half believing . " Lord , " I heard Dick Halter exclaim as the musicians loweredtheir fiddles , and those two broke away from one another . " I 'd give ten years of my life to put them on canvas the way they looked just now ! " He broke off with a sigh and I knew how he felt . Guests were beginning to arrive and there was a tremendous bustle and babble from that moment on . Wheels grated and hoofs crunched on gravel as carriages drew up to the door . Their swaying lanterns made the long driveway between the spruces alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help Rose upstairs as I had been told to do . " I 've counted fifty ladies a'ready , " she confided to me when we were alone among all the outspread wraps of silk and wool and velvet . " And there must be as many more men folks . ListenTime Out of Mind 109to ' em down there . Such a clatter puts me in mind of the way the gulls carry on over to Fiddler 's Reach when you come by real near in a boat . " " Yes , " I said , " you ca n't hear the music in the tent for all the talking . They say every room in the Tavern 's full up , so many came clear from Bangor . " " You go on down now and enjoy yourself , " she urged me . " The most of the crowd 's here and I can manage alone . Here , back up , and let me tie your sash in a better bow . You 've sat it out a'ready . " But still I hung back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below . " Go along , Kate , " she almost pushed me out of the door . " And mind , you 're not to help in the dining room or pantry . Annie and your Ma and waiter men can do it . You 've got as much right to a good time as anybody . " I went with thumping heart , and when I found myself in the midst of so many unfamiliar faces I felt all of a panic , worse than having to speak a piece the last day of school . The Major and his sister , with Rissa and the two cousins , stood under the family portraits in the east parlor . I could only catch an occasionalsight of them for the press of people coming up to pay their respects . I felt lost , wedged in a corner , with only now and then a face from Little Prospect to smile at me ,  --  old Doctor Robbins , or Reverend Chase , or Miss Ada Joy in her best black silk and lace shawl . Henry Willis came by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was almost as great a crowd eating and drinking . " Well , well , Kate , " he said , smiling at me from behind his spectacles , " so you 've grown up , too , along with Rissa ! My , it seems only yesterday you stopped at the office to get warm on your way to the Folly . " " Rissa looks lovely , does n't she ? " I said , " And Nat . It most scares me to see him in that new black suit . " We drank a glass of punch together , and went to look at the dancing . The tent was filling up with couples and there was Nat1 0 Time Out of Mindtaking one girl after another out on the floor . Rissa and her cousins had come out now , leaving the parlors to older guests . I knew Henry Willis was anxious to be back there , so when I saw Dick Halter , also watching , I went over to his side . He looked almost as out of place there as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " Are n't you dancing with Rissa ? " I asked him . He smiled and shook his head . " No chance to so far . But she 's promised to have a bite of supperwith me soon . " " Let 's get some now and take it down to the boathouse , " I suggested . " You ca n't lift a spoon hardly there in the dining room for the crowd . " He thought this a good idea and together we carried out plates and sandwiches ; some of the pink ices and cakes , and a whole pitcher of punch that mother had saved out in the pantry . After the hot rooms the night air felt reviving on our faces as we went down to the shore . I could feel the coldness of wet grass against my ankles , and a full yellow moon was up above the trees , brightening all the nearer and a farther waters . " Accidit ut luna plena esset , " Dick Halter said . " That 's latin , Kate , and it means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had moonlight nights , too , all those years ago in Rome and Pompeii , strange as it may seem . " I made him tell me the words again , saying them over after him as we went down to the water together . That is why they have always stayed with me , though they are all the latin I shall ever know . To our surprise there was a faint light in the boathouse beside a lantern hung over the landing steps . I had n't thought that maybe men from the anchored boats might be there and we both stopped uncertainly with plates and pitcher in hand . " That you , Kate ? " I heard my name , and suddenly there was Jake 's broad face showing in the light of a lantern . CHAPTER XI KNOW now that a day or night or even a certain hour can set its mark on a person as surely as a flood tide will leave a shell or bit of kelp stranded far from its accustomed place , or fireweed show bright where blackened ruins have long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night of the reception . I can look back to it and see that it changed me , though to all the rest of the household and even to myself , I was no different when I arose the next morning . But changed I was . Never again could I step back into the easy ways of childhood , for I had been stirred by what I was still too innocent to name . Love was in the very air of Fortune 's Folly that night . The lights and the music and all the voices that met and mingled and are now scattered and gone , made it seem real somehow , almost like a light wind going by . A queer sort of summons , that was one with crickets and fiddle strings , made the young dancers in the tent draw closer and speak in whispers with shining eyes , and the middle-aged in the parlors keep up a steadier chatter . I was more tired and flustered than I knew from all the hard work and excitement of the week just passed . The things Rissa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I guessed . For the first time I had become sharply aware of my body and the new stirring of my senses . Now , as I sit alone and write the word " I " and the word " me " on the pages of the ledger , my hand trembles . It is as if I were writing of someone else , for when I turn and face the mirror , it gives me back an old woman . Though we go by the same name , we are not one any longer . That Kate Fernald in the muslin dress and blue sash , with the braids of hair about her head , and the wide warmIIII I 2 Time Out of Mind Time Out of Mind I13mouth and smooth brow is dead and gone as surely as if a gray stone with dates and such devices as a dove or a crown or a harp were raised over her . But she can come back to disturb my sleep , as all of us may be disturbed by our own freshness and modesty and half-timid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her eyes clear , but troubled as a spring will be at the first pebble that breaks the surface of its calm . Well , there was Jake Bullard in his blue coat with the brass buttons , an old one of Cousin Sam Jordan 's . He had no further need of it now he was house-ridden after the launching accident , and now that Jake was grown he wore it for best when he went to church or took parties out sailing in his boat . It was n't much too big , for Jake had grown into a square , broad shouldered fellowthe last few years . I realized this as I had n't before when he stepped from the boathouse door into the moonlight . Indeed he gave me such a start that sandwiches tumbled from the plate I was carrying . " Jake , " I said , " you scared the life out of me ! What 're you doing down here ? " He gave me a long look before he answered . " I fetched a party over from Bennett 's Landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait and sail ' em back . I told George Button to tell you I was down here . You took your time coming . " " Well , George did n't tell me , and this is Mr. Dick Halter , you know , he teaches Nat and paints the pictures . This is Jake Bullard , " I added , a bit flustered at our all meeting there . " Hello , Bullard , " Dick Halter waved the pitcher in greeting . " Kate and I brought down some refreshments . There 's plenty and I guess you 'll be glad of some if you 've got that wait ahead of you . " " Thanks , " Jake spoke awkwardly , " I would n't mind wetting my whistle . " We followed him in with the things which we set on the table beside his lantern . We three sat on the steps going down to the water where se='eral skiffs were fastened . The tide was half. way up , making a soft sound against the wooden piles . We could hear the music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men on two of the anchored sloops as they called across to one another . " Been up yet and had a look round ? " Dick Halter asked as we sat there solemnly eating and drinking . " No , " Jake helped himself to another tumbler of punch . " What would I do up there spreeing it ? I 'm here to earn ten dollars . It 's what I ask for a night 's work , but I do n't have to make a fool of myself same 's some do . " " It would n't hurt you to take a look at the dancing , " I said . " You like the Portland Fancy yourself , and the contra . " But he shook his head . " Do n't think much of summer people , I take it ? " Dick Halter went on . " Well , " Jake was growing more talkative as he ate and drank , " it depends how you look at ' em . For payers , they 're not so bad , and I figure on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their money . " " I 'm not belittling money , " I heard Dick Halter tell him in his pleasant way that even Jake could n't take offense over . " God knows I 've had to make every dollar I 've had since I was fourteenand it has n't been easy going . But , still , there are things I would n't give up doing for all the money in creation . " I knew he meant his paints and brushes and the pictures he was going to make with them someday . But I knew , too , that he was thinking of Rissa and what a difference money would make when it came to telling her he wanted to marry her . Presently he got up and said he must be getting back to the party . I knew he would be hunting for Rissa and I did n't like to tag him any longer , so I stayed on with Jake , seeing that he wanted me to . The pink ices were running into their little lace papers and we ate them up between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Jake said when we were alone . " He do n't give himself so many airs , if he is a fool about1 14 Time Out of Mindmoney . I guess he would n't make too free with you like some of those city fellows . " " Why , Jake , " I said , only half guessing at what he meant , " I do n't know why you 're carrying on so . There 's hardly one of those others up at the party I know to speak to . They think I 'm just ,  --  " I broke off for I could n't bring myself to say the word that was troubling me . " I 'm just so much furnishing to them . " " Well , you leave ' em alone , Kate . I 've seen plenty of goings on this summer . " " Cousin Martha says you 've made most a hundred dollars with your boat and odd jobs . She says you 're counted the smartestboy in Little Prospect . " I could n't see his face for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reached out and squeezed my hand . " This summer 's nothing to what I 've got planned for next , " he told me . " I 'm going to buy that big sloop of Joneses and paint her up and take parties out regular . Then I 'll get some of the boys to sell me their fish and clams and lobsters and I 'll do the peddling round . You can ask a bigger price if you bring things right to their doors . Yes , Sir , I figure by the time I 'm twenty five I 'll have a pretty fair start , and I wo n't stop there either . " " But that 's most five years off , " I reminded him . " It do n't matter so much long 's I 'm on the right track . I 'd a heap rather be on my way up the hill than going down it same 's the Major is . " " The Major 's got plenty , I guess , even if business is slack the way they say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , unpleasant laugh . " Yes , look at the way he 's selling it off . It 's common talk he 's let that fifty acre wood lot go the other side of jubilee . They 're bringing a gang to cut it next month . " I felt more aghast than I wanted him to see . " Well , what of it ? " I told him . " The Major knows when to sell and it wo n't show much way over the other side of the mountain . " Time Out of Mind Y 15 " Everyone says they jewed him down and he was a fool to let it go . He 'd better of hung onto that and let some of his shore front go for summer houses . That 's where the profit is now . I expect that jamboree up there , " he jerked his head towards The Folly , " cost him a lot of money , and where 's the good tomorrow when it 's all over ? " " It sounds nice , though , down here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're playing . Nat 's teaching me how to do it . " " Now do n't you mix up with that sort of thing , " Jake 's voice grew hard as it always did when I was foolish enough to mentioneither of the two Fortunes . I was sorry I had let it slip out and as I listened to the distant music I recognized it for the one Nat and Rissa had danced to before all the people came . I had been more pleased to see Jake than I would have believed I ever could be . He seemed like something strong and dependable and he had missed me . I felt all at once what most women crave , whether they admit it or not , a longing to be wanted ; to come first with some man . It had been a jolt to me , being somehow alone up there among all those people , with Nat and Rissa too busy to give me a word or even a look . Now my hurt pride was eased a little , for I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bullard . Not that he 'd ever said so , but I knew , and lately mother and Cousin Martha and even Rose and Annie had twitted me about him . " Kate , " I heard him say , almost as if he had read my mind , " I think a whole lot of you . I guess you know that a'ready . " I could n't believe my ears . I would as soon have expected one of the spruces or a rock or even Jubilee mountain itself to speak up as to have Jake say such a thing . I could feel my face getting red and my heart pounding under my ruffled dress front . But I tried to answer him same as if it was n't anything to put me in a flutter . " And I think a lot of you , too , Jake , " I said . " That 's good , " he went on , " then we do n't have to bother saying it again . I 'm not much hand with the gab and you ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could feel his breath116 Time Out of Mindwarm against my neck . His stiff shock of hair brushed my cheek . " But it 's all right long 's you and me know how it is . I was n't going to say a thing yet , only when I come here tonight it kind of riled me seeing you all dressed up and jigging it round up there . I did n't want you to go and get any notions . " Even though a queer numb panic had come over me , I could n't help feeling pleased that he had thought that , so I did n't pull away as I had half a mind to . " I have n't got any notions , " I told him . " Shucks , " he laughed , " all girls have . That Nat Fortune 's the poorest spindling fellow from here to Portland , and you come on the run if he crooks his little finger . I 've seen you . " " Well , but Nat 's different . There is n't anything I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross , scraping noise in his throat and I hurried on . " We 've been together , the three of us , ever since we were little , and he 's off next week for college . " " I hope he stays there for good and all . " Jake was holding me very close now , and talking faster than I had ever heard him . I began to think of the tumblers full of punch he had had and I wondered if that might have had anything to do with his suddenly loosened tongue . " Do n't you say a word to anybody , Kate , " he was going on , " but I 'm laying my plans and you 're in ' em , too . I 'm going to get my hands on a lot of money , and be somebody round here . You just wait and see if I do n't . We 'll show folks what 's what , eh ? " " What sort of plans ? " I wriggled a little free of his hold and thought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave another of his short laughs and held me tighter . " How 'd you like to live up there in The Folly someday ? " " But I do now , Jake . " I could feel the callous places on his big hand as it pressed my bare arm . " I do n't mean same 's you are now . " He spoke as I had never heard him before . " I mean if it was ours , the way it 's going to be someday . " Time Out of Mind 117 " Jake you 're crazy ! " I was honestly shocked by his words . " I guess you 've had too much of that punch . Mother said the Major put I do n't know what all into it . " " I 'm not crazy , " he told me , " or drunk either if that 's what you mean . Only you remember , and keep your mouth shut , and do n't worry if we have to wait maybe a long spell before we can get married and set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hive of bees and I felt myself struggling up from the step beside him . But he got up too and still kept hold of me . I could feel his heart hammering away under the blue coat and my hair caught on one of the brass buttonsand came tumbling down over my shoulders . " Oh , Jake , " I panted , trying to catch the falling pins with my free hand , " you 'd ought not to talk like this to me . Somebodymight come by and hear us . " " Well , let ' em ! Everybody down in Little Prospect knows you 're my girl . But we wo n't say no more now . Come on , let 's have a kiss ? " I had no time to answer or draw back . I was frightened feelinghis lips hot and heavy on mine , and too dazed to move a muscle . It did n't seem real to me somehow , not even the roughnessof his chin that set my face burning hotter . " There , " he said , letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sealed the bargain . Do n't you forget it now . " I do n't remember how I left him or how I went back to the house . My heart was going it like a woodpecker at my side . I pressed my hand there to ease it . Yet I could n't have told whether it was fright or shame or a queer kind of excited pleasurethat made it go so furiously . I was like a wild thing runningbetween the spruces , with my skirts damp about my ankles and my hair half falling down . As I ran I heard those fiddles and the piano and harp playing a two-step , and the lanterns through the branches were bright as little spying eyes . Then I heard someone call my name , and I stopped at the edge of the driveway , knowing it for Nat 's voice. i a 8 Time Out of Mind " Kate , " he said , " I 've been looking for you . Let 's have our dance . " " Not out in the tent in front of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into my tumbled hair . " I could n't do it . " " All right we 'll dance out here then if you do n't mind  --  wet grass . What 's the matter ? I never saw you look this way be-fore ? " But he did n't press me when I made no answer . We did the two-step there all alone on the dark lawn at the edge of the tent and somehow I was n't as clumsy as I 'd expected to be . He made even my unaccustomed feet go through the right paces . When the music stopped I clung to him as if we had been little again , playing games in the attic or hayloft . " Oh , Nat , " I found myself saying , " I wish " Go on , say it . " His dark eyes smiled back at me , though his mouth was grave . " I wish things did n't have to go and change , " I said , " the way they have to . " " I know , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comforted me . I left him there and went up to my room . Frisky welcomed me in the dark with lappings and whines . I undressed without lighting a candle and lay on my bed listening to the music and all the voices below . The little dog 's body was warm at my feet , but I shivered under the bedclothes for a long time . My head throbbed with going over and over all that the night had brought me . I was sorely troubled and alone . I heard mother pass my door and I called out good-night to her , feigning sleepinesslest she should come in and wonder at my wide staring eyes . After awhile there began to be sounds of horses and wheels on the gravel and I knew from the shouted good-byes that the party was breaking up . Later on I heard the faint splash of oars and voices from the water . They were singing " Good night , ladies . " Then that dwindled to a fine thread of sound , and died , Time Out of Mind ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea on the outerledges . The party was over , but the tide of life it had brought to Fortune 's Folly had left a mark on at least one member of thathousehold . CHAPTER XIFORTUNE 'S FOLLY was suddenly cleared of youth as if a broom had swept it clean away . I alone remained that fall , like a forgottenapple , left to the frost on a stripped bough . I felt more lonely for those other three than I knew at the time . I seldom went into the silent parlors and I avoided the boathouse , since it had become too full of associations for me , both happy and disturbing . Rissa , I missed as I might a half-indifferent , beautiful older sister ; Dick Halter because he had been so kind , so ready to counsel and share with me his wider world . But Nat took the very savor of life with him when he went . I might have been the piano in the east parlor , which was a dumb thing now without his quickening touch . Mother was gloomy , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the cold that gripped her now at the bones and joints . She missed Rose , who had also left soon after the receptionto go back to her old home . She had lost a married sister some months before , and too urgent calls had come from her brother-in-law and his brood of children to be denied . Even mother had favored her return . " Yes , dear , " she had told her , " you ca n't deny your duty to that snarl of young ones that are your own flesh and blood . You take him now , while he 's still bereft , before he hunts out some flighty , chicken-headed girl to marry . For that 's what he 'll do if he stays single long enough . " " Lord , Mis ' Fernald , " Rose had giggled , not at all startled by the idea . " My poor sister has n't been buried four months yet . You 'd ought n't to go and think such things , much less voice ' em ! " I20Time Out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall as well as the next one . " Mother had been unshaken in her predictions . " Once you get the place and the young ones in hand , you can have what you want out of him , even if you are most forty and given up for an old maid . " Rose had turned scarlet under this flow of advice . " Well , time will tell , " she had answered . " Not that I 'd have looked at Bill once . But I guess I 've about had my fill of working for other folks . Yes , I guess I could do worse for myself . " Such cool and practical plans for marriage were a shock to me . I did n't see how she and mother could take it all for granted like that . Besides I was beginning to guess that there was much that concerned the marriage-bed which I did not rightly understand . The girls at school had whispered things together in corners , as girls will . And I had a queer jumble of disjointed facts which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now began to recall and to sort out in secret , fitting them as best I could with certain sights I had seen about the barn when male and female beasts answered the call of their kind . I could not bring myself to question mother . She seemed too remote from such doings . There was I , living proof that she had been wanted and taken , yet I could scarcely believe that she had been courted and wed in her time . I might have gone to Rose , but she had left , and Annie Button was too staid and deaf to be any use to me . I was friendly enough with the girls in Little Prospect , though now school was past we were somewhat scattered . Besides I continued to feel a little shy of them , and they were not quite at their ease with me , resenting as they did my intimacy with Rissa and the Fortune ways I had picked up . So I put two and two together as best I could and the Bible helped some , though there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzled me . " The Song of Solomon " in particular , could stir me to inward ponderings . I used to keep the old Bible open to that in my lap and read over the beautiful , singing words , while the Reverend Chase droned away in the pulpit and mother dozed beside me . My cheeks would flush as I read : I22 Time Out of Mind " I sleep , but my heart waketh ; it is the voice of my Beloved that knockeih saying :  --  Open to me , my sister , my love , my dove , my undefiled . " It was all dim and mysterious , and it drew me like music . Then , as I sat with the Bible still on my lap , I would seek out Jake in the Jordan pew across the church . Maybe our eyes would meet and he would give me a sheepish grin . And I would be more confused than ever , trying to fit him in with Solomon 's Song . I knew I could never call Jake Bullard " My Beloved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was all troubling to a young and untried heart . But I liked to have him wait for me after church among the tilted stones of the graveyard . It was pleasant to walk back together for Sunday dinner at Cousin Martha 's , and to have him fetch me home at sunset in his boat . We had few words to say to one another , but I took his presence gratefully and did n't mind the occasional sly kisses or squeezes . I was glad if he praised my new beaver hat or the coat with the squirrel tippet mother had contrived for me from a cast-off of Rissa 's . Mother was openly pleased that we had started to keep company . She could talk more freely to Jake than I ; they chaffed and teased one another as I could never have done . " You 're a queer , deep sort , Kate , " she chided me sometimes . " You 'd ought to make more of Jake now he 's singled you out , Lucky he 's close-mouthed , too , and do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as sociable as a pair of clams when you 're together ! " I thought she would have been surprised to know how Jake had carried on in the boathouse the night of the reception . But I said nothing . To others she spoke of us with satisfaction . " Yes , " she would say in the village . " I could n't ask for it to be any different . He 's never had eyes for another girl from the time they was children . ' Course , he has his way to make , and he 's got sense enough to wait till he 's put some by before theyTime Out of Mind 123can start to set-up together . So I wo n't lose her for a good spell yet , and I do n't have to worry ' bout her being an old maid . " Several of my school mates were also linked with Little Prospectboys . Cousin Martha 's Ruth was keeping company with Will Stanley who had gone to work in a store in Rockland . He brought presents enough to turn her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ill tell him he 'll spoil her for housework , " Cousin Martha would sigh as she fingered the yards of soft cashmere , or the new glass beads he had brought . " She always was one to put all she could on her back and leave the dishes go and the beds unmadetill ten o'clock in the morning . He wo n't be so foolish over her once he 's had to eat scorched chowder and soggy bread . " " He 's got a right to pamper her if he wants to , " mother would say . " It do n't last long , dear knows , once they 're married and the babies commence coming . " The only fault she could find with Jake was that he brought me no gifts . He was too saving of his money , and while she commended him for this in public , in private she sometimes remarked that a present or two would n't come amiss . But Jake had no use for such nonsense . He told me so often enough . He and Ruth had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had small use for one another . Hilda , the younger girl , was n't so pretty as her sister , but everyone agreed she was smart as a whip . She had no regular beau as yet . I think the boys were all a little afraid of her sharp tongue . Figuring had always been easy for her and that winter she went every day to work in Blodgett 's General Store . Old Mr. Blodgett was somethingof a fuss-budget and he said she kept his books in better shape than they had been for years . Hilda took after her father 's side and was thin and spry and dark . She never missed a sociable if she could help it and she always out-danced the rest of us every time . Of my old schoolmates , Sadie Berry had been closest to me . She was older by a couple of years and by reason of greater experience . She came of a large family and was by far the pret-124 Time Out of Mindtiest of several sisters in her blue-eyed , pink and white way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her body plump and neatly made . She might have had her pick of the boys for miles about , but though she liked them all , she could n't seem to settle on any one . " I 've got time enough for that in a year or two , " she told me . " I do n't want to get tied hand and foot for awhile yet . I mean to see new places and folks and have some fun while I 'm young . " " Do n't you want to get married , Sadie ? " I asked her . " Oh , yes , I s'pose so . But not right off . You know how it is , once the ring 's on your finger , it 's dishes and baking and babies from one year 's end to another . Maybe it 's different with you , but I mean to kick up my heels while I can . " " How 're you going to ? " I questioned her . " Well , " she told me mysteriously . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So I was n't much surprised when it came out in September that she was going off to Boston to work in a hotel . A girl who had been nurse to some children in a summer family had helped her get the place . There was a lot of disapproving talk about it in the village . I stood up for her against Annie and mother who acted as if it were nothing short of a calamity . " I do n't see where 's the harm in it , " I insisted . " Well , maybe you do n't , " mother was short with me , " but you will someday . Her mother 'd ought to put a stop to it , ' fore the trouble 's too late to mend . " " But it was all right when Rose came here to work , " I pointed out . " It 's different working in a respectable place for a private family . I 've heard all about those city hotels and what goes on in ' em . I 'd take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing ! " " Yes , " Annie was almost as disapproving , though less vehement . " It 's taking an awful chance , but Sadie was always the bold one of that Berry brood . She 's too pretty to give her freeTime Out of Mind 125rein same 's her mother does . Well , I hope she keeps her head , but it ai n't likely she will with all that yellow hair on it ! " I still thought them unreasonable , though there was no further use in argument . I managed to smuggle out my best silver bow-knot pin as a parting gift to Sadie the day before she left . It was a pretty pin that Rissa had given me once on a birthday . I knew Sadie liked such things to wear , and I have always been glad I put it in her hands . " Good-bye , " I told her , " I 'm going to miss you a whole lot . " She had walked partway back with me and now she was turning away in the late fall sunshine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indoors . Her cheeks were soft and pink as she kissed me . " And I 'll miss you , too , Kate , " she said affectionately . " Maybe if things turn out good I can get you a place up to Boston . ' Twould n't do you and Jake any harm to be apart a spell , and you 'd have some money of your own that you would n't have to account for to anybody . " I shook my head and smiled . I knew it was n't for me . I could n't just pick up and go like that , though now I know I could have gone to the ends of the earth to answer the summonsof one I loved . " Well , then , " she laughed as she left me , " you write me all about what goes on this winter . And if nothing happens , same 's usual , you write me just the same . You 're good with your pen and I 'll answer if I can get the time . " Next afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sadie on board . I could make out her little figure waving from the bows , and I waved back with a towel from the upper hall window . There was another one gone , I thought , feeling new loneliness as I went back to my sweeping and dusting . I had taken over a good share of Rose 's work now that school no longer tied me . It had been mother 's idea and I had fallen into the plan without protest . The Major had spoken to mother of late about cutting down household expenses . He had met with certain reverses , he told her , as if everyone didn'tI26 Time Out of Mindknow all about the idle ship-yard and his selling out his interest in his vessels one after another . Only the " Rainbow " was left to him , and she cost him more each year than she brought in . Often she was laid up for months and if she was lucky enough to be sent out something always happened . She 'd never had a good name in shipping circles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given up urging the Major to let her go to any bidder , and now there was none to take a sailing vessel off his hands . Mother thought it only right that I should help about the place now I was grown . But she made it plain that I was only doing so in exchange for my board and room . I was not to be paid wages as if I were a maid . She wanted me near her and it would fill in my time till Jake should be in a position to set a definite date . I do n't know what she told Major Fortune of this , but he seemed to favor me more now that I had such prospects . Lookingback on it , I think he perhaps shared his sister 's feeling that my early intimacy with his son and daughter might have spoiled me for plain ways and the village girls and boys . He did n't like Jake much because of his Jordan connection . Sam Jordan had been a thorn in Major Fortune 's side ever since the ship-launching . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met , which was seldom . Major Fortune had much business in Boston that fall and was away , taking Bo with him , for weeks on end . October was beautiful that year past all believing . Or perhapsthis was only because I was more acutely aware of it in all my newly sharpened senses . Heretofore the gold of oirches and maples , the orange of berries , and the flame of blueberry leaves and swamp maples had been enough in themselves . But suddenly they had become disturbing , for besides their own actual shape and color , they seemed to mean something else ; something that I needed another heart and mind to share . I had no means of easing myself of such a load of loveliness as crowded upon me from every roadside and pasture . I did not know the reason for this , or guess that my lonely restlessness was a sign that I had put off forever the self-contented cocoon of childhood , when noTime Out of Mind 127other person is necessary to pure rapture . Maybe towards the last this state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle years when our lives are too closely bound to others will seem as strange as those early , simpler ones do to me now . But that fall I was at the mercy of every colored leaf and berry ; stripped bare to the brief shining of that northern Indian Summer . I might have been a chestnut freed of its burr , or a snail without its shell , set helpless in a too-bright world . I was filled with notions that I only dimly understood . Things I had read long ago in books came back to me with new meaning , and sometimes I would be stirred by flashes of truth that both frightened and soothed me . I remember once coming through the spruce woods in late afternoon and being moved by the way the sunlight struck in between the close-packed brown trunks , roughened by lichens on their north sides . It shifted quickly as I stood watching . Now one group of trees would be brightened till the drops of resin glittered on the bark , and the needles on high branches shone like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull and dark as the light moved on to quicken another group and yet another . It came to me in one of those flashes of insight that are rare to most of us even in a lifetime , that it was like that in the world . People , I told myself , are never all in the sun at the same time . When it lies warm on one , another is in deep shade . I think Moses himself before the miracle of the burning bush , could not have been more shaken than I at this revelation . And there was no one to whom I might tell it , only Nat 's little dog Frisky , with her anxious , dumb eyes and her stump of wagging tail . I stayed indoors as little as I could while the good weather lasted . There was plenty of picking and gathering to be done about the place and mother most lenient with my strayings . " Enjoy it while you can , " she would say , " winter 'll be on us ' fore we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is bound to mean an extra cold one . " " There 's an old butternut tree up the creek , " I told her one12 8 Time Out of Mind Time Out of Mind 129morning . " I 've a good mind to take the punt and row up there with the tide . I could fetch a couple of baskets back . " I did n't tell her the rest of my scheme which would not have pleased her . She did not see me fill a basket with apples , and another with winter vegetables . I sneaked out a jug of new cider from the shed , and got them all down to the boathouse without mishap . I baled rainwater out of the old punt and stowed the things in at the stern to keep her well trimmed . Frisky had followed me to the shore and begged so to go along that I had n't the heart to refuse her . Since Nat 's going she had attached herself to me and stuck closer than a burr . Being so much with Nat in his illness she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort in having her by me . The punt was a clumsy boat , with heavy oars between stout wooden pins . I should have found it heavy going but for the tide that had started running up from sea . Although it was so much later in the season it put me in mind of that other trip the three of us had made up country so many years ago . The swamp maples and sumach were still scarlet and birches golden between the crowding spruces , although the water near shore was thick with their fallen leaves . I rowed close sometimes to let them flutter down upon me in an incredible rain of yellow or flaming red . Nat would have liked to do that , I knew . It would have set his spirits off to a new kind of music . I missed him more as I came to the ledges where he had played to the seals . But the rocks were empty . No sleek bodies mingled with the brown kelp that moved with the current ; no round heads bobbed up as I passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far inland now . The butternut tree was n't half as distant as I had made out to mother . I tied the punt and went up to fill an empty sack I had brought . It was hot picking and stooping and I was tired by the time I had dragged it back to the shore . Frisky had had her fill of chasing chipmunks and was glad to rest and help eat the lunch I had fetched . The sun stood high overhead and the grass was shrill with crickets . Their chirping was like the beat of far music , which I heard through the nearer persistence of my ownthoughts . For the last week or so I had been possessed with the idea of Old Lady Phibben and my untold fortune . The hornets had cheated me of it nearly eight years before and of late I had thought much of what she had told Rissa and Nat . It seemed to me that I might be less troubled by the future ; by my keeping company with Jake , and by all the other inner questionings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards for me and look at my outspread palm . Most of all if I could hold her lucky stone in my hands , I felt I must be helped . I was practical and hard-headed enough in most ways , but I could n't forget what she had said to Nat about watching out for the white horses . I was drawn to her as only the young are drawn to what can not be rightly explained in everyday terms . I knew the old woman and her son still lived at the mill , though every year people in the village thought they could not stick it out there another winter . Crazy Tim I had seen sometimes in his fishing boat , and though the summer people objectedto his queer looks and still queerer speech , and said he ought to be sent away to the home in Rockland for such oddities as he , no one in Little Prospect bothered to take him there . He was harmless and as long as the pair of them could get along , they were left in peace . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time I came in sight of the place , I was half ready to turn back . At first it looked deserted . Then I saw smoke coming from the makeshift chimney . I tied Frisky to one of the seats and fastened the punt to an overhanging beam . Just as I was telling myself I was in luck to have the son off , I heard one of his thick grunts and saw him above me on the tottering planks . He looked wilder than I remembered and his animal-like sounds set Frisky barking fit to rouse the dead . " Hush , that . " I said to her sharply , and not knowing how else to deal with him , I handed up the baskets and jug . He took them with more grunts and grins , and not without qualms I climbed the slimy ladder that led up . The barking had brought Old Lady Phibben to the door . She was little changed from my last sight of her , being the dried , 130 Time Out of Mindspare sort of woman who might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all one could tell . I thought she looked like a grasshopper , and I half expected to see her take a leap into the air , or begin fiddling with her long , skinny arms . I could tell she had n't an idea who I was and I had a time explaining this to her above her son 's gibberish and Frisky 's barks . " There , now , Tim , " she spoke with firm kindliness to the excitedfellow , " it 's all right . You bring those things in and go back to your fishing . " He dumped the baskets inside , seized an apple and made off grinning foolishly . I followed the old woman in to the one room . I remembered it dimly from the other visit , and it amazed me to see her geraniums in tin-cans in the sunny window ; her well-kept stove and kettles , and the bed with its quilts in the corner . A ladder led to a loft where I think her son must have slept . There were braided mats on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of a table covered with a worn cloth of rich red . We sat down on either side of it and gazed at one another for some time . Her hands lay in her lap , and they were so brown and scrawny they put me in mind of those star-fish that children dry for keepsakes . " So , " she said at last after she had looked me over to her satisfaction , " you 're the one the hornets stung so bad , and now you 've come back for your fortune . " I nodded dumbly and said the apples and vegetables were a present , along with the cider , but I 'd be much obliged if she would give me back the baskets and jug . She rose and emptied them and returned to her chair . " I expect you sneaked off to come here ? " She kept her keen , old eyes on my face . " Your mother 'd never of let you go off on any such chase . " " No , she does n't know , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell anybody the other time , and we never have . " She looked somewhat mollified . " I 'm glad you kept your word , " she said , " it 's more'n some do . Time Out of Mind 131You 've turned out good , " she went on studying me from head to foot in a way that made me blush , " not that I could tell what you looked like before with all those hornet stings . I hear the Fortune pair are off to the city again . " " Yes , " I told her , " Rissa 's in Philadelphia with her cousins for the winter and Nat 's at Harvard college . " " Still pindling is he ? " " Better , " I assured her . " lots better now , though you were right about the white horses . We did n't know what you meant till after the Major sent him away to sea . How did you come to know they were called that in poetry ? " " I do n't know what you 're talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told what I saw in his hand . I do n't explain , I only tell what 's there . You have to make what you can out of it . " " Oh , of course , I thought maybe if you 'd look at mine , " I spread out my two hands on the cloth and leaned across the table searching her old face . " And if you 'd let me hold that lucky stone , too . " " Remember that , do you ? " She looked pleased . " I ai n't had it out for a long spell , maybe it do n't work no more . " I saw she was only teasing me , so I smiled , and waited . " A party of summer folks come here last July , " she went on , " and tried to wheedle me into fortunes . Do n't know where they 'd heard it , but I would n't let on I knew a thing . It 's risky business . They might complain and have us sent away somewheres , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You do n't have to be afraid of that with me , " I promised . " You do n't look like one to go back on your word , " she said , still keeping her eyes on me . " ' T was thoughtful in you to bring the things . I ai n't had a decent apple all fall . Yes , I guess I 'll trust you , Kate Fernald , what 'll it be , the cards first ? " " You only did Nat 's with the stone and his hands , " I decided , " that 'll be enough for me . " She went away to the back of the room and fumbled in a wooden chest , while I waited anxiously . Outside the crickets13 2 Time Out of Mindwere more than ever clamorous , and though the sun came warm through the checked curtains , I felt suddenly cold along my back bone . But before she began she questioned me further . " I hear things ai n't so prosperous with the Major , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round the globe same 's they did once . " " Well , " I hedged , not wanting to commit myself . " He thinks sailing vessels will come into favor again , but Henry Willis says steam is here to stay . " She nodded . " He was due for change , I told him so years back ' fore it commenced . But he 's one you could n't give advice to . They held their luck too long ; thought ' t would always last . But ' it 's like a tide , been on the rise for Fortune 's a long spell ; now it 's turned and low water 's setting in . " My loyalty would n't let me agree with her . " Oh , " I said , " I guess it 'll be all right , even if shipping is n't what it used to be . " " I know how ' t is , " she wagged her grey old head . " He wo n't swallow his pride . It 'll be the end of ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . When I was young the old folks used to say Many a tree furnishes the handle of the axe that fells it ! ' " I was too impatient waiting to know my own future to heed her . But the saying has stayed by me , and her words come back sharp as axe blows . " Yes , " she went on , " lightning 's most apt to crash in a high steeple . That 's another thing they used to say , and it 's true . But , there , it do n't mean nothing to a young thing like you . Give over your hands , now , and I 'll tell you what I see there , good and bad alike . " I could n't keep them from trembling a little as I stretched them across the table . " Strong , " she said , and her voice dropped to a softer , more remote tone . " My , what a life-line ! Not a break in it . You 'll live to be an old woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Time Out of Mind 13 3 " Yes , yes , " I murmured to hurry her on . This was not what I had come to hear . " You 've got a good head , too , " she continued , tracing with her spidery forefinger . " Slow , maybe , but sure , and you 'll work things out in your own way in secret . No one 'll ever tell you what road to take . You 'll find it alone and it wo n't be easy going . " I must have shown my disappointment , for she turned to another line and went on more briskly . " You 've got a heart that 's bigger'n your head , child . It 's wide enough to take in a raft of people and those that find their way to it 'll never be turned aside when they come knocking . There 's plenty of love in it , too . " My flagging spirits quickened to this and she smiled . " Love 's what they all want to know about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one kind they ever have in mind . Girls always want to hear ' bout who 'll come courting . I only see love or hate plain , not the one it 's for or from . But love 's written all over your palm . It runs out between every finger , like streams overflowinga well . You 've got a giving hand , not a taking one . It 's always one or the other . " " But there 'll be someone to love me ? " " To be sure there will , " she bent closer . " Two of ' em , as different a pair as a red-winged blackbird 's two sides . One 's dark , and one 's red , and their ways lie far apart as the poles . One 'll bring trouble and pain , and the other easy , quiet ways , and which you 'll take I ca n't say . But when the time comes you 'll follow your heart and not your head . " " Tell me more about the  --  the dark one ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flies high , " she said , frowning at my palm , " very high against the sun . If he falls it 'll be far and a great noise there 'll be and many echoes of it . You 're earth , child , all earth , and he 's fire and air . Yes , you 're born of different elements , you two , but hearts may agree though heads differ . You 'll be close even with seas between . " " And the other one ? " I pressed her . " He 's earth , same 's you are , only you 're made of fruitful soil134 Time Out of Mindand he 's born of granite and iron . Watch out his love do n't turn to flint and do you hurt someday . " " Oh , dear , " I said , " it scares me when you talk that way ! " " You asked for the truth and the truth is what I 'm bound to tell you . " But she patted my hand as she spoke . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you through , Kate Fernald , so just you give yourself to it when the time comes . And now for the lucky stone . " She gave it over and I held it first in one hand and then in the other . Watching me closely she seemed pleased and once more nodded her head . " Same 's I thought , " she told me , " you take a firm grip ; but not too tight a one . Your fingers open and close easy . Remember how the Major 's girl gripped it ? ' T was like a vise . But you 're one that knows when to let go . " She took it from me and hid it again . When she returned she was all for every day matters , and her voice had lost the deep , far note that had been in it . Though I still kept my hands on the table she no longer looked at them . I could n't draw another thing out of her save questions about Little Prospect doings and whether the Major had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was through with me , I rose to leave . " Good-bye , " I said , " Thank you for telling my fortune and " She cut me short . " Mind now , I did n't tell you a word . I 'm much obliged for those things . Poor Tim and I 'll relish ' em a long time . I expect you wo n't be this way again soon . " I agreed to that . " Mother says winter 'll be here before we know it . She thinks it 'll be a hard one . " " And so do I. Tim 's laying in fish and wood to see us through it . Yes , I wish ' t was over and spring here a'ready . My grandmotherused to say she never felt right till she 'd got past May Hill , and I 'm the same . " The tide was well up as I left and the ladder not so steep andTime Out of Mind 135slippery to climb . Crazy Tim came out from the woods and made me know by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his boat . But I shook my head firmly and made haste to push off . I had no wish to be seen in his company and have mother ferret out my afternoon 's visit . Frisky barked furiouslytill we were round the point and out of sight of that uncouthfigure . The sky was still blue , but faint feathers of cloud had sprung up out of nowhere . " Mares'es tails , furl your sails " , I said aloud as George Button had taught me to when I was a child . I knew as I said it that winter had come , though the sun felt hot on my bare head . I got the punt headed into the current . As my arms moved with the heavy oars , my heart still beat fast to the memory of Old Lady Phibben 's words . They stirred me , with a sort of foolish excitement I could n't explain . Yet she had n't told me what I had gone there hoping to find out . CHAPTER XIII HAD half a mind to write Rissa of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fortune , word for word , as well as I could remember . That is why I have been able to give it so fully all these years after , copying it from that paper filled with my schoolgirl flourishes . But I held off from sending it , for Rissa was different when she was under the spell of Bessie and Jane Marlin , with their heads too crammed with dresses and parties and such . She might even show my letter to those two and have a good laugh at my expense . So I hid what I had written , and tried to put it out of my mind . There was a power of work to be done getting ready for Thanksgiving and Annie Button laid up off and on with the tooth-ache . Mother grumbled that it was plain inconsiderate of her to fall by the way when we were short handed , but though she scolded Annie , she was tireless in laying on poultices and other home remedies . " Not that they 'll help her much , " she confided to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for mince-meat . " She 's kept her own longer'n most and she 'd better go straight over to that man in Rockland that hauls teeth and get a new set fore we 're frozen in . I told her so when they commenced to plague her last summer , but she dies hard , Annie does . " But Annie Button and her teeth soon became an old story to us , and we were presently absorbed by the Major 's return from Boston . He came by the " Rainbow " and once more she lay at anchor just outside the Harbor . It was more than five years since I had seen her and though her sails were dingy and her paint no longer glistened in the sun , her lines - ere as clean136Time Out of Mind 137and graceful to see . She bore herself proudly , like an aging beauty , whose bones are still finely made in spite of wrinkles and fading color . She kept her air of distinction , so that one forgot the vicissitudes that had beset her , and only noted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapering masts , and the gracious swell of her rounded stern as she sat at her moorings . I was glad Nat was not there to see her from The Folly windowsthat overlooked the Narrows . She would have reminded him too keenly of those bitter months which were only lately beginning to lift from his mind . I waited on table the night of the return , since Bo was busy bringing the Major 's belongings up from shore . Henry Willis had driven over and the two men talked so intently together that they scarcely noticed me or the food I set before them . " I hoped you 'd get rid of her this time , " Henry Willis said . " There was n't a bid fit to mention , Henry , " Major Fortune told him . I thought he looked worn and tired , even with the soft , kind light of candles on his face . " You can spare your breath and your I told you sos ' . She 'll be bringing in at least something of what she 's cost me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans you 've got afoot for her ? " " Load her to capacity with all that lumber we 've got on hand . I 'm in touch with a firm in Galveston who 'll take it at my figure . Here 's their letter . " He pushed a paper across to his friend . I missed Henry Willis ' comment by going out to get the roast . When I came back they were still at it . " You 've guaranteed that captain too much wages , Nathaniel . You 'd have done better to let me dicker with him . " " He would n't come without an advance and a written agreement . They 're a slick lot now . " The Major sighed . " They all want berths on steamers or packets . You have to hunt to find a man sensible enough to stick to canvas , or too old to learn new tricks . " " Well , perhaps you did the best thing to get a better man and pay him more . How about your crew ? " I3 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bo filled in some and I guess we can pick up three more around here to go along now the summerseason 's over . " " And the insurance ? " Henry Willis waited with a frown above his spectacles for the reply . " That 's another matter . " The Major kept his eyes on his plate , and hedged a bit I thought . " You know the old one lapsed last night . Well , I did n't see the need of taking out anothertill the lumber 's actually put aboard . I 'm not going to insuretill we see how much she can carry . " " You mean she 's sitting out there now , Nathaniel , without enough to cover her in case anything happened ? " The Major fidgeted with his food . " She 's as safe here as she could be anywhere under the sun . " The Major pointed out . " I can keep my eye on her right here from my own windows . It 's only for ten days or so at the most . She 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's done we 'll begin stowing it . It 'll save me a pretty penny if I wait till I can wire them exact figures . You ought to be the first one to see that , Henry ? " " I do . But suppose anything happens ? " " Nothing 's going to . I 've got great confidence in this new captain , and I 'll wire for a new policy the minute she 's ready to sail . " " Well , it 's your affair , but I would n't take a chance like that , not for more profits than you 're going to make out of the whole voyage . " The Major cleared his throat impatiently and set down his knife and fork with a great clatter . " I need every extra dollar I can lay hands on right now , " He said bitterly . " And here 's a chance to pare down expenses . I must say it sounds queer to hear you urging me to pay out cash for once . " His friend reddened at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spend , " he answeredTime Out of Mind 39dryly . " But you and I never see them the same way . Well , I would n't take such a risk . " " Any risk 's too much to ask you to take , you old crab in your shell ! " The Major was trying to laugh him into forgetting . I could see that . " I 'll say no more then , Nathaniel . " Henry Willis spoke with finality . " I 've always kept clear of that vessel which I 'm more thankful for every day I live . I was born cautious and you were born reckless ,  --  that 's the truth in a nutshell . " " And we can leave it at that . " The Major was still trying to be jovial against the disapproval that met him across the table . " All right , All right , " Henry Willis saw there was no use going on with the subject . " Only . " His forehead still puckered in the way I knew so well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandmothers used to tell us ,  --  It only takes a small twig to poke out the eye ! ' " The Major laughed , but there was no hearty ring to the sound he made . " That 's old women 's talk , Henry , the kind you always did listen to . What 's the Rainbow ' and her cargo got to do with twigs poking out the eyes ? Come on , I 'm for a fire in the study and a glass of sherry . " I thought no more of their conversation ,  --  not till some days later when I had reason to remember it . November was a slack time with men in Little Prospect . Fish and lobsters were less plentiful in the nearer waters , and with the ship-yard and saw-mill idle , only odd bits of carpentry and painting remained to be done . So it was easy to set every ablebodiedman to work dismantling and re-loading the " Rainbow " . I had expected Jake Bullard to jump at this chance to earn some extra dollars , but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not going to do so . " I 'm right in the middle of over-hauling that sloop I bought , " he told me . " I want to have her in good shape to put up for the winter and now with everybody pressed in to work on the Rainbow ' , I 'll have to manage single-handed . Besides , " he half140 Time Out of Mindhesitated before he went on , " Sam 's got himself kind of unhingedwith her in these waters again . " " You mean Cousin Sam 's against your working for the Major ? " I asked him . " Yes , " he admitted , " I do n't mind telling you if you wo n't blab it round . He ai n't near so twisted in his legs and back as he was , but I swear he 's worse tied up in his mind and opinions . " " I know , mother and I think sometimes he acts most out of his head , specially if he gets off on Fortunes . " " Well , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riled . He 'd be sure to find out if I was working on the Rainbow ' . He 's been awful spying lately . He goes on for hours to the men at the store or the wharves ' bout how it 's all on account of that blamed vessel he 's dragging round the way he is . Most of ' em just humor him along , but I tell you the fits come on him bad ever since she dropped anchor here . " " She 'll be off in another week , " I reassured him . " The Major thinks so , if they push the work . He 'll be better , I guess , once she 's sailed . " " Yes . " He gave a sigh as we walked on together . " But I could have used the money just the same . Still , I figure it ai n't worth it to set him off worse'n he is now . " " I 'll be glad , too , when she 's gone , " I said . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bringing bad luck because of what happened at the launching , only it does seem 's if she 'd made lots of trouble . " I was thinking of Nat and that the " Rainbow " had nearly cost him his life , but I was wise enough not to bring his name into our talk . " I expect he 'll carry on ' bout it all through dinner , " he warned me as we climbed near the Jordan house . " If you try to reason him out of it , he only gets worse . I 'll be good and ready to move out when the time comes . I pay regular for my board and keep and if ' twas n't for Martha being my own sister and doing for me when I was little , I 'd clear out now . " " Oh , you could n't do that yet , Jake , not when they have suchTime Out of Mind 141 a time to get along as it is . Wait till Ruth 's married and Hildacan bring in more . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breath showedblue on the sharp air . " I declare I 'd sooner listen to Sam raveas to hear that pair complain all day . " I wished that mother had come along with us when I took myplace at the dinner table , for as soon as Cousin Sam had mumbleda blessing , he was off . " Pull that shade down , Martha , " he commanded from hischair . " I ca n't swallow a mouthful with the Major 's Bow of Promise ' in plain sight . May Hell 's lightning strike it to splin-ters . " " Oh , now , Pa , do n't begin that , " begged Ruth . " Will 's heretoday and he do n't come all the way over from Rockland tohear you go on ' bout Fortunes . " " It 's nothing to you young ones your own father was crippledso 's she could slide out nice and easy on her ways . " He refused to leave the " Rainbow " even with the shade between him and her shape on the far waters . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks for it . Throwed out on the dump-heap , like a cracked spar ,  --  me that took the biggest risk and always done thedirty work . " " Oh , Sam , for heaven 's sake , eat your dinner , " Cousin Marthatried to distract him with a heaped plate of chicken and dumplings . " No good comes of crying over spilt milk . " " Fortunes took me and broke me , " he went on in shrillertones , " and you sit there and talk of spilt milk . " He swallowed a large mouthful but before any of us had a chance to break in , he was off again . " It 's all Fortune doing we 're so hard up . I made good money when I was whole . There was n't a smarterman in the yards and you know it . " " But , Pa , the yards have been shut down these seven years . " Hilda spoke up in her pert way . " You might think of thatonce in awhile . " " And I spose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Redspots began to show on his sunken cheeks above the bone. 142 Time Out of Mind " Well , I guess he did n't want to have ' em empty and idle , did he , Kate ? " Hilda was determined to make me his next target , in spite of the scowl Jake sent her across the table . " She 's a good one to ask . " Cousin Sam gave a short unpleasantlaugh as he looked over in my direction . " Mother and daughter , they 're a pair of slaves to that family . It galls me , yes , it galls me when I think of ' em deluded and driven from morning till night up there in the Folly . " " We 're not driven . " I spoke up fair and square . " Fortunes have been real good to us , and  --  and you were the one that sent us there in the first place . " " To my everlasting shame be it said ! " Cousin Sam thumped the table so hard the dishes rattled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I was nigh to death I pleaded with your mother to leave . Carrie Fernald , ' I says , says I , you ought to have more pride'n to stay under the same roof with the man that 's dealt me a death blow and then throwed me out . You 'd ought to think more of that girl of yours than to let her learn their ways from his children ,  --  hard-hearted , proud ways that wo n't do her no good . ' Yes , I told her the truth , but would she listen to me ? She would not , for the taint had got into her blood a'ready , so she put him and his afore her own flesh and blood . That 's what I 've lived to see . " " Oh , leave ' em lay ! " Jake broke in crossly . " Kate 's got a right to eat her dinner in peace , has n't she ? " I gave him a grateful squeeze under cover of the tablecloth . It was good of him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he disapproved of all my dealings with the Fortune family . He squeezed my fingers back with a grip that made me wince . " Well , " Cousin Sam subsided with only a few more rumblings , for he was really afraid Jake might move out if he offended him . " All I can say is , it 's hard when your own family sit back and see you hurt and humbled by another man 's pride . When they wo n't take your part against him that done it . When they even go and serve him and his . " Once more he threw me aTime Out of Mind 143dark , reproachful look . " But I tell you I 'll get back at him yet . I 'll get my chance and when I do I mean to take it ! " His words were not new to me . We had all listened to them before . But they had a queer , frightening ring that day that took away my appetite . Somehow I could n't let them just roll off me the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giggling together , and Hilda chattering away to her mother about the new line of goods that had just come for the store . I was more relieved than I could have told anyone when the meal was over , and Jake volunteered to sail me back . " It 's turning cold , Kate , " Cousin Martha told me , " if you wait awhile I know Will would drive you back in his father 's team . " But I protested that I did n't mind the wind . I preferred to be cold , rather than to stay on and listen to more talk . Jake had hard pulling to get us out of the Harbor . As we came out into the Narrows we passed close to the " Rainbow " . I was filled with all manner of memories and misgivings as I looked up at her steep , dark sides and thought how far those weathered boards had been and into what strange harbors her long prow had nosed a way . It was all so bound up with me ; with Rissa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed close I could fairly hear again the clamor of her launching , and those drumming blows whose beat I should never quite lose from the dark of my mind . Though she had been painted over many times , a faint arch of color still showed at the stern . That other rainbow was withering , too , even as those of sun and rain and air . It made me shiver and look away as if I were watching somethingdwindle and die . " Haul up that shawl you brought . " Jake commanded , mistakingmy motion for cold . " This wind cuts , but we 'll have it behind us once we 're past the point and I can raise my sail . Gosh , I 'm glad to get away from the house ! " " So 'm I. Jake , cousin Sam 's worse'n I ever saw him . " " I told you the Rainbow ' had set him off . I kind of wish , though , " he looked back at the vessel we were now past , "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
