Parade ( words &; music by Paul Peters , George Sklar &; Jerome Moross ; Theatre Guild , producer ) is an experiment which demonstrates some of the possibilities and all of the shortcomings of presenting songs and dances on a soapbox . Originally this " satirical revue " was scheduled for the rampant Red Theatre Union , which last year put on Messrs . Peters ' &; Sklar 's Communist melodrama Stevedore ( TIME , April 20 , 1934 ) . In that locale , Parade 's sour skits and migraine melodies might have had some relevancy . At the Theatre Guild , which has a tradition for art rather than garment-loft politics , Parade gives its spectators no pleasure , no precept , but plenty of punishment . Its successive theatrical floats savor unhappily of Union Square , seem as homemade and impotently angry as the bedraggled banners of striking bushelmen . <P> No single item of Parade 's bill lacks a heavy-handed social implication , but some interest more than others . Examples : <P> A sketch in which a loyal family on relief cheerfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the " starving Russians . " <P> A sketch in which a Jeeter Lesterish farmer suffers an AAA " professor " to destroy his wheat and cotton but shoots the professor when the latter wants to kill his mule . <P> A song number called " Dancing In Central Park , " in which a standard romantic lyric is tagged with the extraneous line : " Tomorrow is the fear in my heart . " <P> A song called " Life Could Be So Beautiful " ( " There 's more than enough for all " ) which is bewilderingly illustrated by some female dancers in ball gowns , some male dancers in curious green corduroy suits . <P> High point for ineptitude : a Mississippi Negro woman plaintively singing a " Letter to the President " in which she reminds him that before the elections she , as a sharecropper , was promised many good things , including " a barrel of applejack . " <P> Those who make the theatre a business instead of a political arena were not surprised that Parade 's three distinct assets-a dancer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not Union Square . Spry , mad-eyed little Esther Junger ( Life Begins at 8:40 ) , clad in bold costumes by Constance Ripley , appeals to other senses than that of social injustice when she performs wildly in the Cuban sugar cane . And shy little Jimmy Savo is most capable not when he is being beset by police , or starving in the street , or dying of appendicitis in a neglectful free clinic , but when he is up against his old comic difficulty of making a complicated and terrifying piece of machinery work . As the proprietor of a " puffle " works whose employes are on strike , Funnyman Savo becomes entangled in a ten-foot blue print , has first powder and then oil squirted into his surprised face , nearly electrocutes himself before the whole contraption collapses . Audiences found all this a long way from Karl Marx , were appropriately grateful .
