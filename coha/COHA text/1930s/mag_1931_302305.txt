LUMBER-Louis Colman-Little , Brown ( $2 ) . * <P> Jimmie 's father was a Northwest lumberman , his mother a slut . When his father was killed Jimmie did not stay home long . He bummed around the lumber country , became a millman , had a good time , made good wages . When he met Pearl he meant to seduce her ; instead he proposed . They were settled in their own house and had two children when the trouble began . <P> Because he once saw a bum beaten up by a cop Jimmie had joined the I. W. W. ; but his enthusiasm waned , he had never been active . Then the War started , wages boomed , the Wobblies started strikes in every mill they could . But it was an unpopular time to strike ; soon the Wobblies were made to realize it . Bodies were found of men who had " committed suicide ; " homes were wrecked , men beaten up by night-riders . Jimmie did not advertise his I. W. W. membership but it was known . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; when the trouble was over he resigned as a Wobbly . But from then on nothing went right . He lost job after job , wages tumbled ; first one child , then the other died of spinal meningitis . They would have been evicted from their house if Pearl had not paid a banker in a way Jimmie could not forgive . One day he did not come home from the mill . A buzz-saw had killed him . <P> If Doctrinaire Upton Sinclair could get as much feeling of helpless human tragedy into his propaganda novels as Louis Colman gets into Lumber , Socialists and <P> Capitalists alike would take more stock in Upton Sinclair . Lumber is not recognizably propaganda , but it is a story of Labor , and if you can read it without being moved , you deserve to have the Wobblies get you . <P> The Author .
