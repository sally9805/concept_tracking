On Land : As darkness settled down on the little Scots hamlet of Castlecary late one afternoon last week , the local train from Dundee pulled into the London &; North Eastern Railway station . Around it swirled a December blizzard that blotted out the lights of the village , stalled the train . Without a second 's warning the mile-a-minute Edinburgh-Glasgow express following the local crashed into it . Rescuers , lighted by bonfires made of debris from shattered wooden coaches , took out 91 injured , 35 dead-Britain 's worst rail-road disaster in two decades . <P> On Sea : En route from Kobe to Manila , steaming down the rock-strewn coast of Formosa to avoid the Japanese-controlled war zone in Taiwan Strait , the Dollar Line 's 21,936-ton President Hoover grounded last week a few hundred yards off Japan 's Hoishoto Island 500 miles north of Manila . There , with 1,000 passengers and crew safely ashore and on other ships , the $8,000,000 liner was slowly being battered to pieces .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
