THE LAND IS BRIGHT-Archie Binns- Scribner ( $2.50 ) . <P> In a little over a decade the Oregon Trail carried " the greatest migration in history since the Children of Israel went to the Promised Land . " In fiction , the old Oregon Trail is still well plodded . But far fewer novels than pioneers have come through alive . Outstanding survivor was H. L. Davis ' Honey in the Horn . Archie Binns 's The Land Is Bright is another . <P> Author Binns , himself a descendant of an Oregon Trailer , centres his story on a family of Illinois farmers who made the trip in 1852 . His characters are plain folk , not fancy Indian-fighters and adventurers . His Indians are mostly beggars and hangers-on , a menace only to horses , cows and the pioneers ' imaginations . The real enemies are cholera , diarrhea , dust , heat , rivers , white bandits , traders , quarreling among themselves . Out of jealousy , the caravan captain ruthlessly abandons a middleaged , kindly schoolteacher in the desert . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another captain , abandon women and the sick because they can not keep up . The romance between Nancy Ann and a hard-muscled " recruit " picked up along the way is as earthy-gritty as their food during a dust storm . <P> At journey 's end , in the fertile Willamette Valley , battered mentally and physically , the survivors are tough-skinned men and women whose memories hold at least as much to forget as to remember .
