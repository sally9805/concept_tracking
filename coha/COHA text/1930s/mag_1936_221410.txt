The Commons : <P> Subjected Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin to polite badgering about the main naval issue over which the United States and the United Kingdom have for 14 years been at odds . Britain , which has many naval bases , seeks an international treaty to hold all navies down to small-sized short-ranged warboats . The U. S. , having fewer naval bases , seeks an international treaty permitting all navies to have large-sized , long-ranged warboats . Last week His Majesty 's Loyal Opposition argued that the obvious and fair solution is for the U. S. to enter a treaty limiting all navies to small-sized , short-ranged warboats in return for a guarantee by the U. K. that all British naval bases will be available to the U. S. Navy . <P> Loudly recalled by His Majesty 's Loyal Opposition were the many occasions on which U. S. and British statesmen have proclaimed that their countries will " never again " fight each other . Abruptly putting these professions to a British test last week , Liberal Geoffrey Mander asked the Prime Minister directly whether His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naval bases with the U. S. Navy . <P> " No , sir ! " answered Stanley Baldwin with a finality which closed the issue . <P> Debated indecisively , while Colonel Charles Augustus Lindbergh listened in the Distinguished Visitors ' Gallery , whether the divulging of " shocking evidence in murder cases " is adequately restrained by the Act of 1926 . <P> Were gravely disquieted and murmured against Baldwin Cabinet " bumbling " when last week Britain 's first winter night air maneuvers had to be suspended by the Air Ministry after two machines crashed with six deaths . The ominous explanation : " foreign sabotage . " This , coming so soon after three cases of " sabotage " in the Royal Navy ( TIME , Feb. 24 ) , enhanced the anxiety of the House . Its nervousness was further upped by news that a highly important and secret Foreign Office report had vanished from British hands and had been embarrassingly divulged to the world in Rome last week . <P> To have thereupon accused the British Foreign Office 's civil servants of an " indiscretion " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of British journalism . Instead last week , the London Daily Telegraph spoke of Italian secret operatives having filched the document out of British hands " by a clever piece of indiscretion " - neatest trick of the week . <P> Received back into the House the diffident and bespectacled Secretary of State for Colonies , young Malcolm MacDonald , both he and his father Ramsay MacDonald having now won seats in by-elections after losing out in the general election . MacDonald Senior escorted MacDonald Junior in to take the oath and sign the roll last week amid bedlam from Labor 's benches . <P> " Daddy Judas brings him home , " and " Al Jolson and Sonny Boy ! " were among the more abusive comments of His Majesty 's Loyal Opposition . As Father &; Son stiffly and swiftly withdrew , Scottish Laborite John McGovern roared after the Secretary of State for Colonies : " He 's following his Dear Old Dad , though he does n't know where he 's going to !
