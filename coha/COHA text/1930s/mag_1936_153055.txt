First automobile radio on record was built in 1922 by one William Lear of Quincy , Ill. , who sold it to a doctor from Kahoka , Mo . The doctor drove all the way to Los Angeles and back without tuning in anything , later found that the power plug had been put in backwards . First regular factory production did not come until 1927 , long after cabinet sets had squealed their way permanently into the U. S. Home . Through 1927 a modest score per day were built by a little concern now a subsidiary of Philco Radio &; Television Corp. , biggest U. S. radio makers . <P> Until 1930 radios in automobiles were scarce as scarabs and just as expensive . But in that year sales shot up to 34,000 sets , more than trebled in 1931 , and two years later were up to 724,000 . Sales volume was at last diluting price and beginning to float the automobile radio off luxury heights . Producers cut prices further , watched 1935 sales bounce to more than a million . <P> In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not escape the alert eye of General Motors Corp . Last week GM bought Crosley Radio 's automobile radio division at Kokomo , Ind. , announced that , at additional cost , it would install radios as initial equipment in new cars . Hitherto General Motors cars , like many another make , have been built to take receiving sets should the customer buy one as an extra . No newcomer to radio , General Motors some years ago made home sets in a short-lived venture which was liquidated in 1933 . <P> Speed of the automobile radio boom is clocked by the fact that the industry is now talking hopefully of a 1936 production of 2,000,000 sets compared to an estimate of more than 4,000,000 for household units . Since about 4,500,000 cars will probably be sold this year , nearly one out of every two may carry a radio as naturally as a spare tire .
