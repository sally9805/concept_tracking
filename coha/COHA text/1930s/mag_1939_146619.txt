A onetime vaudeville pianist , he listens to a record by a crack jazz pianist a couple of times , then bangs it out himself . He was in the Navy during the War and still loves boats . He has a speedboat called Leading Lady . When he wants to take Leading Lady for a spin in the bay , he has a husky attendant carry him from his apartment to his car , then drives to the dockside , where he is carried into the boat . For Claude Joseph Bradley can not use his legs , spends most of his time in a wheel chair . The 30.000 barrels of cement he sold last week were all sold by telephone . <P> It was not until last year that Brad began to have trouble with his legs . Then he had " woozy " spells , his legs buckled under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when the woozy spells continued , he decided to go to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota . There a number of doctors examined him , shook their heads . A cancer in his arm had spread , settled in his spine . <P> One day Dr. Howard ( " Howdie " ) Gray , once a famed Princeton footballer and more recently famed as Jimmy Roosevelt 's surgeon , came into Patient Bradley 's room . <P> " What 's new ? " said Brad . <P> " Well , " said Dr. Gray , " we might operate . " <P> " Well , and then what ? " <P> " No good . " <P> " Oh . Well , what the hell . I 'd rather live a couple of days longer anyway . " <P> They told Brad the best he could hope for was a few months or a few weeks , advised him to go home and get his affairs in shape . Brad went home , began calling up his friends . " If you wan na drink one more , you better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm shoving off . " <P> Brad 's friends came . Last week about 200 of them threw a party for him at a Brooklyn club . It was a gay evening . Brad cracked jokes , played the piano , made a speech . He took one of the roses at his table , put it in his lapel . <P> " Fellas , " he said , " according to the doctors , I 'll soon be wearing a lot of these on my chest . I 'll be taking a long vacation in Flatbush cemetery . Well , what the hell , thousands die every minute . When you got ta go , you got ta go . " <P> Brad 's friends cheered him to the rafters , toasted him again &; again . Next day , when newshawks asked him where the roses were , he said , " Roses ? Why , they planted ' em on some of the boys who passed out at the party . "                @ @ @ @ @
