Every well-informed citizen of Kansas City knows how the late Robert Alexander Long went into the lumber business , boosted Long-Bell to be the largest lumber company in the world operating under one ownership , built the company city of Longview , Wash. , and paid himself , as founder-chairman , a $60,000 salary during good years . The first years of his married life Lumberman Long passed in a $700 cottage in a corner of a lumber yard . But before he died last March , aged 83 , he had erected for himself a huge 70-room porticoed limestone and marble Renaissance house-fine even in a finer place than Kansas City . The house alone cost $575,226.07 . Inside was placed a profusion of Austrian hand-tufted carpets , tapestries , urns , silverware , china , pictures , bric-a-brac , chandeliers , for which Mr. Long paid $207,763.57 . There were Oriental rugs in every bathroom . House and contents were listed on his personal ledger as an $11 asset . Last week more than 1,000 Kansas Citizens gratified a long-cherished ambition to see the inside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long possessed except the sets of Dickens , Eliot and Bulwer-Lytton which lined the walls of the little oak room where he read the Bible every morning and to which was brought his 10 o'clock glass of milk . While Auctioneer William Henry Jones grew hoarse trying to get better prices and Housekeeper Catherine Viles wept salty tears of sadness , bidders and gapers were able to glean from the house 's elaborate furnishings how pious Lumberman Long liked to spend his days . At the foot of a marble and bronze stairway was a red plush and Gobelin tapestry sofa ( sold to Harry Jacobs for $410 ) on which Mr. Long and the late Ella Wilson Long used to sit only at Christmas when they gave presents to the servants . In the French salon beneath an enormous pear-shaped crystal chandelier ( sold to Dr. Abraham Sophian for $470 ) , was a walnut and gold-leaf player piano ( to Mrs. John K. Jasper ; $1,325 ) , a matching walnut cabinet for music rolls ( to Mrs. Victor Schutte ; $87.50 ) . A rose and ivory French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vases and urns , including a huge Austrian-ware receptacle decorated with a lavender , red and green battle scene ( $250 ) , stood in every room . Lumberman Long had few pictures , none by famed artists , but liked bibelots like his small ivory goose ( $2.25 ) . Gongs announced dinner even when Mr. Long was alone and his valet played the organ while he sat on Aubusson-tapestried chairs , ate from English china , drank from hand-cut crystal goblets ( sold for $280 ) . At large dinners , a silver tankard more than two feet high ( $135 ) decorated the table . A sufferer from asthma , Mr. Long had a mahogany stand on which he kept his atomizer . In the basement he had his own two-chair barber shop . Last thing to be auctioned will be Mr. Long 's 70-room house , for which a Catholic boys ' school was expected to bid .
