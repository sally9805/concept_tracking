txt Buying of steel products has not yet increased to the extent anticipated when price advances for third quarter delivery were announced about ten days ago , indicating that consumers have not yet started stocking material to take advantage of the lower quotAtions on current transactions . However , from inquiries which have come out , It is considered likely that there will be an increase in contracts within a week or so , and some consumers will make efforts to cover for their early third quarter needs at current quotations . Ability of steel ingot production to hold up without the benefit of any large amount of forward buying is therefore viewed as a most encouraging sign . The operating rate has been well maintained because steel is going into con , sumptive use for many miscellaneous manufactured products . Motors Demand Slower A let-up is noted in the demand from automotive and allied industries .

Thus , instead of a steadily declining operating rate , which usually accompanies a Summer lull , production could readily turn upward by the middle of August . Some rail mills , which have been running rather well for the last three months , should complete their production on orders previously taken by the end of this month . Unless some additional contracts are forthcoming these mills will shut down , thus reducing the demand for steel ingots from this source . There has been considerable talk of rail contracts likely to come out before the middle of July , but . thus far no inquiries have been received by rail makers . The best opinion is that whatever business develops in this branch will be straggling , with tonnages moderate at best . Railroads are factors in steel , however , through the requirements for cars which now are being built by equipment makers or in shops of some carriers .

Operations have been running around 100 , ; I- for most makers and requirements of the can manufacturers are large enough to assure a high rate of output for some time to come . Containers for beer have been factors with the warmer weather . Because tin plate contracts usually are taken for an entire year . especially from the large can makers , there is to be no change in the quotation for this product for third quarter delivery As a matter of fact quite a few steel interests believe that the current quotation of 33.25 per base box will be continued In 1937. although it is admittedly too early for such a prediction . Much will depend on costs , etc . at the end of this year .
