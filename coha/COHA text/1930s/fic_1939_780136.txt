 | a proper shave . Sitting now on a clean bed , Alan whistled as he bound up his swollen ankle . Beside him was a complete outfit of clothes the young man had lent him . So this was the end of that black winter ; he was sure of it . Just because he had swallowed his pride ? Was it always that easy ? He gazed at himself a long time in the mirror before he went downstairs . A new resolve was kindled . And with his returned confidence he spurned the proffered want ads and asked for the names of the largest concerns in Columbus . The young fellow smiled , but obediently brought forth the classified telephone directory ... . The sun dazzled him as he came out of the offices of the Arabian Nights Products Company , " Makers of Fine Cosmetics . " Yet he was no longer surprised ; he had transcended that sensation . On his own hook he had found a job  --  at least , with his own courage . The pride to swallow pride . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street . He savored the air of this American city ; the very hum of automobiles in traffic was music . He stopped to explore the windows of Lazarus ' department store . A week from now he 'd have twenty dollars to spend ! It would n't go very far : a down payment on a suit of clothes ; shirts , ties , socks , handkerchiefs . But to be able to spend at all ! Funny , how you could walk along blindly , observing no beauty  --  when you had nothing , or too much . Those two great hotels ahead , these billboards and electric signs , were magnificent . No longer menacing , but a glorious indication that America was still rich , a money-spending nation . Money to spend because there was money still to be earned . He passed the capital building , surrounded by its spacious acres and its statues of McKinley and other favorite sons ,  | and turned down Broad Street . When he came upon an imposing restaurant he resolved to eat his dinner there . He 'd take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same smile . " No , I ca n't let you do that , it 's an expensive place . We have a very nice cafeteria here . . . and do n't thank me , my friend . Get down on your knees and thank your Maker . " His eyes shone righteously behind his glasses . " Well , I 'll pay you , first payday , " Alan promised , and escaped hastily . If Whitey had lent him ten dollars and a suit , the moral would n't have had that rusty edge . And then maybe he would have figured it out that way for himself . But now he could not . The personnel manager led him across the big accounting office and showed him his desk , facing a man who was working a comptometer . The sound of activity stirred him ; the clatter of typewriters and adding machines and the heavier rumble of bookkeeping machines , run by the girls . " Here comes your boss-=Mr . Heimer , " the personnel manager told him . " He 'll explain the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far end of the room waddled a little man , bearing formidable ledgers . He wriggled between the fumed oak desks , his mouth pursed precisely , speaking to no one . Behind him an almost inaudible titter went up : the girls openly made faces and the men turned down their mouths or smiled mirthlessly . As he came closer Alan could think of nothing but a trained seal . With one fin he plunked the ledgers upon Alan 's bare desk and turned to the man at the comptometer . " I 've got  | to have those reports , Stevenson . We ca n't waste time , you know . " Alan wanted to laugh ; he was n't a tyrant , he was a buffoon , with his squeaky little voice and his pursed lips . " Well , now , " he addressed Alan , " I 'll explain the cost sheets first . This work is very exacting , you must understand that . " All morning Alan squirmed and puzzled under this puny assistant to the assistant head accountant , too confused to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stevenson shoved the report under his blotter . " Let 's have lunch together , " he suggested . " Do n't let little Joe bother you . I 'll explain those cost sheets this afternoon . He gives us all a session , once a month . " " But how 's he ever get his own work done ? " " Oh , hell , he does n't mind staying nights . We 've always said , if he 'd just once ' phone his wife and tell her he was going to work , and instead go out for a beer  --  but that would n't be Heimer . " Alan laughed . He was going to like this Stevenson . Carefully , he watched what the other ordered for lunch ; this was his first lesson on how to live on twenty dollars a week . Probably be harder than living on nothing because these office people were respectable . That was the stock in trade of the white-collar worker , Stevenson talked with a middle-western geniality that warmed Alan 's heart . He 'd been hungry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I went to ' State ' ? the university here , " the other volunteered . " A lot of guys do n't think a college education does ' em any good . But I say , you ca n't get enough of it . I jerked sodas to pay my way . And I 'm still  | studying accounting at night school . A city 's the only place to get ahead . Where would I be now if I 'd stayed in Youngstown ? You from around here ? " " Well , I  --  yes , I was born in Lawsonville . " Not two hundred miles west . Was it pure coincidence that he had taken harbor in the region of his birth ? " I ' spose you went to college at Bloomington ? " Stevenson presumed , and Alan did not deny it . " I 'll bet you 're glad to be in a regular city , eh ? " " City ? Yes , of course , " Alan hastened to agree . Glad to be anywhere .... " You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Know the very place . My girl 's family wants a boarder , and they 'll take you cheap . If I did n't live with my aunt , I 'd do it myself . Nearer to the girl friend , y'know , " he explained , and nudged Alan in the ribs . That night after he was through school , Stevenson called for Alan in a dilapidated Chevy . It was a little embarrassing , not having any baggage ; Alan said it had been stolen on the train . They drove out north to a street near the university and stopped in front of one of a long line of bungalows . Mrs. Buchanan was the motherly type , a spare little woman in an apron which she gathered about her hands as she showed him his neat room . " Now , Mr. Reed , you 're just one of the family , and you come downstairs and listen to the radio . " The radio was a " period " piece , surmounted by a lace doily on top of which was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these bungalows along the street was exactly alike inside . Surely half of them had the same reproduction of that Maxfield Parrish hung over the  | asbestos grate : a child swinging against one of those characteristically violent , purple-blue skies . The carpet was bright figured green , and the imitation mahogany furniture sat primly on its edges around the walls . Over the upright piano was a dull red and gold tapestry of the three wise men . " This is my husband  --  and my daughter Mary . " Mr. Buchanan shook hands meekly and the girl , a pretty little chit , turned her blonde head saucily and sized him up . Steve had told him she was a stenographer in the sales department . Although she and her father rode down with him on the streetcar every morning he could see she was not indifferent , but positively scornful of him . As spring came and the earth began to give off pleasant smells again and the mud of the sidewalks crumbled under the sun every morning , he stopped with Mr. Buchanan to inspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary always stood on the sidewalk tapping her high heel , imploring , " Oh , com-mon , daddy ! Mr. Reed ca n't be interested in those old things ! " But her statement had become more of a question . His goose seemed definitely cooked with her when one Saturday morning in June he volunteered to accompany her mother to the open-air market . To Mary it was unthinkable that he should enjoy it , but he did , enough to sneak off alone early on succeeding Saturdays . In these fresh hours the drays were still unloading their produce , and men were sprinkling the crates of red and green and yellow vegetables till , they sparkled in the sun . He liked wandering up and down the streets , listening to the hawkers sing their wares from the little stalls around the big covered market house , which itself smelled cleanly of sawdust and animal meat and cheeses . On  | each stand were signs made of brown paper bags thrust up on a stick , the prices elaborately marked in blue pencil . The old Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as they arranged their wares , cutting off the green tops of carrots and beets , discarding outer leaves of lettuce until the gutters overflowed . Usually he brought home strawberries , and that made a hit with Mrs. Buchanan . He noticed she always tidied up his clothes for him . Even Heimer could n't disrupt these simple pleasures . By this time Alan knew that he could never satisfy the little seal , and no use trying . But the evenings were long and dull . One night when Steve came over to see Mary , they both insisted he go to the movies with them . They fitted snuggly into the Chevy roadster . Mary was caustic . " Certainly is a treat , seeing you for a change , " she told Steve . " You 'd think your old night school would let you off once in a while . " " I 've got to study , " Steve remonstrated . But Alan knew she did n't confine her attentions to one man . He was learning that fact , to his surprise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so deliberately when he put his arm on the back of the seat to give them all more room . And now here in the movies he could feel her silk leg rubbing against his . An unruly passion , too long denied , asserted itself . After that , Steve was always suggesting the three of them go out together . Alan tried to refuse , but now Mary insisted . One night late in July he kissed her as they sat on the dark porch . For a week he was bothered with his treachery to Steve , but he did not fool himself . She was a pretty cute  | trick , and when she suggested they go dancing he even asked Steve if they could borrow his Chevy . " Sure . I 've got to go to night school , anyway . " As they drove up the river they heard the distant music from the roadhouse and Mary began to hum the tune . " Gee , this is going to be swell , " she anticipated . " We do n't have bands like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hop . " But they were n't hopping to this music . When the singer began to croon Body and Soul Mary snickered , and pressed so close that he could feel her firm little breasts , her stomach , her legs against him . I 'm all for you , body and soul , they sang with the music , and he felt good and glad to be young and alive with a girl against him . She needed nothing to drink ; she was intoxicated with this jazz . And he , too , was succumbing . It was good , it was American ; there was no one who could challenge that . He 'd like to rub a few ideas into those Manhattan heads right now . They left the car in front of Steve 's house and walked home silently . The air was full of hot summer smells and they were suddenly tense ; he could feel her damp hand tighten on his . On the dark porch she began asking him about himself . Before he knew it he was telling her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . " And Princeton ? " Then she said , " Gosh ! " and was silent . " Well , I do n't know that they mean anything , " he laughed . But she pressed him for details . " I 've always wanted to live in New York , " she confided . " And  --  is it true , all the stories you read about Princeton boys ? Oh , you know . . . They 're so many things I want , " she returned to her desires . " If you think hard enough you 'll get whatever you want . Do n't you believe that ? "  | She wanted " nice " things . And why should n't she ? Everybody in America wanted everything the magazines advertised and the billboards shouted and the movies displayed . As soon as business picked up again , there was n't any reason why everybody should n't actually have everything . And it was pretty wonderful , because if you could keep up your installments , you did n't have to wait until you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crept into his arms , and his desire grew overpoweringly insistent . Safe in the dark , she was surrendering ... . She had acquiesced to trap him ; of course he knew that a few weeks after the fever had subsided and she became possessive . In a case like this , the man was always supposed to be in the wrong ; the confession magazines and the lovelorn columns repeated the assertion year after year . But he did n't like the way she always talked about New York now . Steve 's silent resentfulness was easier to bear . Yet in turn Alan was exasperated by the way Steve took Heimer 's orders lying down . And now , the day before Labor Day , Heimer would have to dump this extra cost sheet in their laps . " It 's a damned outrage , " Alan protested to Steve . " Not only more work , but absolutely useless . What 's the sense of spreading the costs this other way , too ? Who 'll look at it ? By God , I 'm going upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job ? Not me . " Steve refused to be implicated . Alan stomped up the stairs , straight to Hodgson , the manager , seething over this display of indifference and inertia . Did Steve want to stagnate here the rest of his days ? Mr. Hodgson received him and listened to the story calmly .  | Then he shook his head . " I ca n't hear any complaints that are n't reported through the proper channels  --  via Heimer to his superior , and on up the line . Suppose you were a private in the army , " he told Alan . " Get me ? The same thing here . Has to be . Cool off and see if you do n't understand . . . . But , young man , I have this to say  --  you 're in the wrong department . I 'd like to see you in sales . We want that sort of initiative from our salesmen . Now , do n't mention this to anyone , but we 'll see if we ca n't find you a berth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sweet satisfaction of that moment was lost as weeks dragged by and nothing happened . People were talking seriously about the depression now , and even the approaching football season took second place . Alan was letting Mary strictly alone , say what she would . To her it seemed only a dodge that he tried to cheer up her father by playing checkers with him . It looked as if this pathetic little man would sell no more real estate this year , even though land values were falling alarmingly . He had stopped tending his garden before the flowers were first bitten by frost . His women probably did n't mean to be extravagant , but Mrs. Buchanan was proud that she set a good table , and Mary never could quite pay for some new dress she had charged . Mr. Buchanan appeared more depressed than usual this evening . Sitting in the living room after dinner , Alan wondered how he himself could stand this much longer : Heimer at the office , and Mary staring at him here , with this pall of gloom over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and tell him if there was n't an opening in the sales department , traveling on the road , he would quit . Take him or leave him .  | " Come on , " he told them , suddenly elated , " let 's all go to the movies . " " No , you take the girls , Alan , " Mr. Buchanan said . " I have to figure out some things . " Mary eyed him resentfully and when they got to the movies she made her mother sit between them . Alan tried to imagine what would become of her ; would she settle down eventually like her family , whose every action she resented ? Yet she had no idea she was worrying her father ; and what , after all , was wrong with wanting to make something out of her life ? That was n't such a joking matter as it used to be ; he 'd learned that much , anyway . After the movies he bought them sundaes at the drugstore , attempting to make up to her . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street she kept in front of them . " I declare , I do n't know what 's come over her , " Mrs. Buchanan said . Mary had flounced up the steps and they saw the lights go on before they reached the porch . Then they heard her scream ; the sound struck him with an almost physical impact , and he dashed up the steps and into the house . Somehow , he knew what was coming  --  even before he saw that emaciated figure of her father , hanging limp , his neck drawn sideways by the belt which suspended his body from the doorway . Yes , of course , that was it : debts but life insurance . And this way his women would be taken care of . But never could they erase the picture of that scrawny , bloodless neck , jerked to one side , the eyeballs open and glazed , the body swinging gently .  | CHAPTER ELEVEN THE middle-western woods flashed past , metallic colors biting sharp into blue sky ; the smell of leaves burning stung in his nostrils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon was only another pumpkin , no more round or orange . Beside every schoolhouse that he passed he heard the thud and thump of footballs . The morning sun streaked along the nose of his shiny new Ford coupe as he burned up the miles over the highway . He sang , and the rushing air snatched the words from his mouth , winging them back toward his unmourned accounting office . Farther and farther from the city which he had so triumphantly kissed good-by two weeks ago . Now his head was full of instructions from the sales school , his brief case beside him bulged with circulars and testimonials and samples ; in the turret deck of his car were the posters of girls with yellow hair and red cheeks and mouths  --  the portfolio of advertising tie-ups with which Arabian Nights Products was enticing new dealers . He filled his lungs deep , inhaling the autumn air . Lifegiving autumn , which always for him had been the season of change , conjuring up memories of school , and the fresh-ink smell of new textbooks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsharpened yellow pencils , the excitement of new courses to be explored , and an untried teacher . . . .  | SLO  --  CURVE  --  HILL .... Farther and farther . CITY LIMITS  --  SLO ... . What to do tonight ? Alan wandered down the main street . Tomorrow he would tackle those department stores first , and then the drugstores . Give them the usual line of chatter ; they could n't afford to resist . Should he go to this movie ? No , he 'd seen that one in a town last week . Still too early to eat . Go back to the same old lobby , the Eternal Lobby , and listen to the same stale smoking-room stories before the same old tired roast beef and gravy ? The gaudy green and the complicated angles of a Tom Thumb golf course caught his eye . Every vacant lot in the country seemed to have been captured by this miniature golf craze during the summer . He paid his fifty cents and waited in line . Across the street in the city park men were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was going on . " That 's part of the city drive to put men to work , " he was proudly informed . " And what happens when that 's done ? When winter comes ? " he inquired , and the fellow merely shrugged . Thank God for a job ! Ohio now left behind , and Pennsylvania . It was snowing as he came into Buffalo . Hodgson in Columbus had discovered his usefulness as a trouble-shooter , and was sending him farther and farther to sample districts , put the pressure on the tough customers and check up on the other salesmen 's industry . Nights he no longer worried what to do ; there were always reports to fill out . But this was the day before Christmas . He drove up to see Niagara Falls and crossed over the Peace Bridge , deciding  | to register at the rambling white hotel on the Canadian side . A damned welcome change ; he 'd begun to suspect every hotel was the twin of the last one . And here he could certainly buy a decent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head ; they could n't sell liquor even over here . A little Jew standing beside him plucked Alan 's sleeve . " I got a quart . Come on up to my room , " he offered . The Jew was an agent for portable radios , the whisky was real Scotch , and they were joined by a Catholic shoe salesman . He hurried them back from dinner so they could listen to Amos ' n ' Andy . " Greatest little invention in the woild , " the Jew said fondly , turning on the radio and pouring them another drink . " Keeps people 's mind off their troubles . And , boy , we got ' em , have n't we ? " The shoe salesman belched . " Sheer extravagance in these days , " he pronounced . " Now , take a pair of our Dee-Light Shoe-Savers ? " " Never heard of ' em . " The shoe salesman looked merely pitying . " Why I 'd hate to tell you how many times over illy boss 's a millionaire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care whether he sells shoes or not . If a store wo n't carry ' em , I say , it 's their loss , not ours . " As if that made him any the richer , this pride , Alan thought . He said , " I 've got you both topped , boys . Everybody 's got to carry cosmetics , prosperity or no prosperity . The men in this country have to draw in their belts  --  or hang themselves with them . But , by God , their womenfolk use lipsticks . Even on the day of the funeral . "  | The salesman was tinkering with the radio , talking about his shoes . " Profane music on this holy night when our Virgin gave birth , " he was reproving them . The Jew winked at Alan and whispered in his ear , " I 'll bet that damned trademark means more to him than his Virgin Mary . " But when the strains of Silent Night came over the air they had another drink and all of them , especially the little Jew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle , Alan put the two of them to bed together . And unsteadily , he closed the door behind them , grinning to himself . Back in his New England again . At his Boston hotel he found a letter from mother . Plaintively she described how lonesome she had been on Christmas . The last page was an urgent plea to come back and " make a new start . " He tore the letter in two , savagely . There was a satisfying quality to this traveling job , he meditated as he rode down through the Connecticut towns . Never could tell whom you 'd meet next , and he liked that . If he did n't , he would n't be going out of his way to see little old Miss Benson , a distant cousin of mother 's . She was a spinster , mother wrote , keeping house for her brother who was a Congregational minister . The neat little parsonage in the neat little white village was exactly like Miss Benson , he thought as he sat before the fire having tea with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been answering dozens of questions about South America . " It must be fascinating ! " she exclaimed , and her clear blue eyes snapped . " But you have n't been to Europe at all ? Oh ,  | that 's a shame , a shame ! " And she began telling him just the out-of-the-way towns to see , and what to eat at various inns , and what was the best season of the year . " You must have been absolutely everywhere , " he marveled . " I 've never been at all , " she confessed . " But I 'm going , and I feel it 's my duty to know every detail so that I wo n't miss a thing  --  not a single thing . " He suddenly wished that he could return to South America with her sharp eyes and inquisitive mind . When she went for more tea her brother leaned over to him . " She 's wanted to go for thirty years , " he explained . " Saving all that time . And now her bonds are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost takes my faith away . " He sighed . " But surely , it 's so inexpensive now ? " " That is n't the only trouble . You see , she 's had heart trouble this winter and , well , she may not be here to go . " For weeks afterward as he drove on , doubling back and toward the south , Miss Benson kept reoccurring to him . Would she get to go ? Where in the name of God was there any justice ? Not that her tragedy was as great as some of the glimpses he caught these days  --  of men selling apples on street corners ; or black , stooping lines of them before soup kitchens , sleeping in doorways . Or the other tales he heard , more and more . A classmate he ran aross in Baltimore who had lost his job the week before his child was born ; and the one whose factory had burned down , along with irreplaceable blueprints . What had happened to them , too ? Encountering these people in the midst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having to guess how they had arrived at such a predicament : unfinished business ,  | he began to call these moments of insight as he traveled farther and farther , weaving a pattern over the highways of America . " But this advertising campaign really gets them . It 's sound psychology , " he was urging the buyer . This was a big account and he was having more trouble than usual . He waited until the floor show was over and then tackled his phlegmatic customer again . " We hit them on two scores , " he explained for the second time . " First , we tell the girls they ca n't expect to hold their jobs if they do n't use our Stay-On cosmetics . Much less get a job without them . And then we tackle ' em on the boy friend . They 're just waiting to get married so they can quit their jobs , of course . So we ask them : What man wants to kiss sticky lips ? Or lips that come off ? Our Stay-On ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community chest , " he answered not very intelligibly . " The store has to chip in so much we are n't carrying the inventories we ? " " Come on , now , it 's not that bad . " " And now what 's Congress doing ? " the buyer wanted to know . " Talking about putting men on the dole . Why , if I were out of a job , I " would n't go crawling around asking for that ! No self-respecting man would . The way I look at it , we 're all in it . Everybody was in the market  --  why , even the man who tends my lawn had his stocks . We 've just got to pull in our belts a little tighter and ? " " What 's the difference , " Alan had to ask , " between your store voluntarily contributing , and being taxed by the government for your fair share of the dole , as you call it ? I ca n't see that there 's any difference . " " The way I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're at  | the bottom of the loop now , and we ca n't do anything about it . As I see it ... " But Alan ceaseal to listen . He had heard this a hundred times in the last few months . It was a pleasure being on the move again , after sessions like that one . Except that , as he passed more and more factories lying idle , padlocks on the doors , no cheerful smoke of industry from their chimneys , this sales talk made him feel more ashamed every time he opened his mouth . Then he recalled Stevenson and Mary Buchanan and the rest of them at the office  --  yes , even the little seal Heimer  --  and he knew there was some sense to it . After all , he was helping them keep their jobs . Spring had succumbed to full , blatant summer . His car was no longer new and every week added another thousand miles or so . He knew the tires were growing a little thin , but this damned rocky Arkansas road was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot glare , took off his coat and reached under the seat for his tools . " I 'll change that tire for you , mister . " A scarecrow of a man with a straw hat flopping on his head was leaning over the fence . His face was like old leather . " You 're on , " Alan said . " Crops look pretty good , " he observed as the man went to work . But the farmer shook his head skeptically . " Government 's buying them now , is n't it ? " " Yep . But we had a drought last year . Cleaned us out . Red Cross were n't no help . They tried , though  --  I ai n't got nothin ' agin ' em , y'understand . But I do n't like charity and they ai n't gon na see me take it . " He spat on the road . " Lots of people say if you farmers had more income we 'd  | be pulling out of this depression . " He was thinking that this man was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't caught in a trap as the factory worker had been . " I guess , ve 're about due for a return to good times , " he added hopefully . " Ai n't never had any good times down thisaway that I knowed about . Guess things have to be a whole lot different to do me much good . " When the man was finished Alan gave him more than he should have and asked how far it was to the next town . The next town . SLO  --  CITY LIMITS . Always the next town , but the same signs . He was working in New Orleans the next spring , a year afterward , when a general sales meeting was called . Washington had been warm and pleasant with its cherry blossoms , but here early May denoted full summertime . The oleanders were in bloom and people were wearing seersucker suits . In the narrow streets of the French Quarter , where he was taken to some painter 's studio for a party , it was unbearably hot , and he spurned their sazerac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he 'd have to fly up to Columbus to arrive in time for the meeting . " Who 's talkin ' about flyin ' ? " a soft southern voice drawled , and he was introduced to its owner , Jimmy Creighton . " Been flyin ' since they was crates , " he told Alan . " Now I got me a little red scooter . I commute between here'n my factory in Cleveland . Stands to reason I 'll have to take you along . " They flew up the Mississippi , keeping the river in view all the way . And gradually the country unfolded beneath Alan like a gigantic map . To their left , beyond that indefinable  | horizon hidden in blue haze , changing from purple to orangered at sunset , lay two-thirds of the whole country , rolling up into great mountains . " I know how you feel , " Jimmy Creighton said when they stopped the first night . " I 'm a Southerner , but I do n't talk about damYankees any more . ' Far 's I 'm concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this old green navigation chart . It 's mighty pretty , looking at that quiltwork of fields , with that old brown snake of a river weavin ' around every which way . Shucks , a car 's no way to travel , you ca n't see two miles aheada you . But up there , you see farmhouses in different counties , right at the same time . And that little pinprick over there , that farmer with his doggone mule  --  he 's just like a neighbor to Joe Bush , down below you . And I bet they never saw each other . " " You 've got it , " Alan agreed . " And all the time I have the feeling that if only we flew a litle higher , we could see west as far as my fine mountains . " That was the part of the country he wanted to see again . And when he arrived in Columbus he persuaded Hodgson to send him out to Los Angeles . There he changed direction , driving north and south now , the length of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East , they laughed at his gloomy talk of the depression . " Brother , we hardly know there is one , " they told him over and over until he began to believe them . Yes , perhaps this was what he had been searching for : not just his mountains again , but a place where man still talked of opportunities . Up in the mountains he ran across men who were working their own mining claims . They showed him the ore that they brought out in old wooden crates , and loaded on their rickety jalopies to carry to the  | assayer 's . The gold content was small , but they talked excitedly of that possible bonanza . " Anyhow , we can live on this dirt , " they affirmed stoutly . " It 's pay , all right . " Maybe it was because everything was a little fantastic out here , from the movies to their climate and their publicized scenery . He found it hard to concentrate on the incidents in Washington which were stirring the press this summer . Out here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt moratorium , but they were definitely vocal about the evacuation of the veterans from Anacostia . Alan heard them talking in a drugstore . " Boy , if that guy in the White House do n't do something , " they said , " he 's going to have a revolution on his hands . Is that any way to treat a bunch of fellas who went overseas ? Just because they 're out of jobs . They ca n't help it . " A year ago , he reflected , they would have said the veterans were jobless merely through hard luck . But now Congress had passed a bill for relief . Tonight he worked a little harder on his report . He hated like the devil to leave here , but there was no more work to be done . Reluctantly , he was writing that to Hodgson . Not loafing on the job was one sure way of keeping it ... . He left the mountains and descended into the desert just as the radios began blaring the first speeches of the presidential campaign . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captured all the flame of this wasted , arid land . He was in a hurry to get on , but he stopped at a lone gas station for a coke . A drawn-looking woman in blue jeans came out . " No gas , mister ? " She almost wept . " Yes , you 'd better fill it up , " he said hastily . He had caught a glimpse of the bare counters inside and a thin little girl .  | While he drank his second bottle of lukewarm orange pop the woman told her story . Her husband had come out here with t. b. , and they had figured this broad highway was a good place to catch the tourist trade . But he had died last year . There were so many stations now and she was stranded , hardly able to pay for a little gas from the splendid oil company trucks which rolled through . So you could be lost , bereft of opportunity or even hope , here just as well as anywhere . Following the highway east again . Near Gallup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confided in Alan that he had saved twenty dollars and was going to work in one of the great cities . " First trip away from home ? " Alan asked . " You bet ! Gee , mister , have you ever been to New York ? Do you think I could get a job there , mister , do you ? " " I 've been all over this country and as far away as South America , " Alan replied . " But I still ca n't answer your question . " It reminded him of that summer when he had left for Rio , only five years ago . As he progressed , the same signs continued to keep pace with him . Driving , he read  --  he had always read : Eats and Drink One Mile  --  Kozy Kamp  --  Curve  --  Fresh Eggs for Sale  --  Caskets and Chairs Rest for the Dead or Living  --  SLO Men at Work  --  ONLY JESUS SAVES HE IS COMING AGAIN  --  Smith 's Camp &; Dahlia Farm Sleep Among the Posies  --  Cattle Crossing  --  Magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't Care  --  DANGER S Curve  --  Burma Shave  --  Indian Medicine Camp Stop Eat Rest Herbs  --  WHY LIVE IN SIN ? Fifty thousand miles of it now , upon an endless procession of smooth highways : white ribbons of cement through green farmland or hedges Al , by bare red mountains , black asphalt through snow or golden wheat , or gray gravel side roads  | through orchards in full pink bloom . And the endless yellow and red and green gas stations , the hot dog and Bar-B-Que stands along the way , the speak-easies which always turned out to be pretty much like the last one , the endless billboards ? all of them whizzed by and kept repeating themselves with a constancy that the seasons lacked . At noon he stopped at one more lunch stand . Like the next one , like the one before . These stands , he realized now , were the epitome of all America , and somehow he liked them , with their shining chromium coffee boilers , and their new electric refrigerators , their homely signs ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the walls between the more professional bright cardboard ads for cigarettes and soft drinks ; coupled with the rather mixed blessings of the nickel-in-theslot phonographs , the horse-race gambling machines , the always blaring radios , and the impudent blonde waitresses in their starched uniforms , yelling " ham and ? " toward the kitchen . All this concern for gadgets and ballyhoo and efficiency , and what other , less definable element ? But that was n't the most important thing . It was that each stand was so like the next , laced together by these highways , clean across America , up and down its river valleys , across its mountain ranges and vast prairies . Only the scene changed ; nothing else was different . The farther he traveled , the more he could see all one , all American . All searching . As he had searched . That was what he had been doing . Suddenly he was tired . The radio blared louder , all the way from the Chicago convention of the Democratic party to this lunch stand in Kansas . Hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care whet Hodgson transferred him to this time .  | UNBELIEVING , he stared at the telegram with Laura 's signature . But what had happened to mother that he should be thus summoned ? This one devastating syllable ? " worse . " They had told him nothing , nothing . And for a moment , standing here in the lobby of a Fort Wayne hotel , he tried to bring back the past months . Had he failed to catch some sign in her letters ? The last one had been  --  let 's see  --  how many weeks ago ? He tussled vainly with his memory . But it was of no import now . " ' When can I catch a train to New York ? " he demanded of the desk clerk . The man rubbed his chin . " Well , let me see . You 've just missed the flyer . The next one is n't until late tonight . " " How about a bus ? " Anything to start him on his way . And in half an hour , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whistling of the great tires and the imperative notes of the horn as they swayed around lesser vehicles , he thought : back on the highways again , even for this . A third autumn has come and here I am , passing the same towns where I have stayed before . Retracing the old , familiar route , watching the same signs and billboards . Even catching glimpses of faces I recognize . But going on  --  so damned slowly . God , I never realized how slowly !  | His eyes were smarting with weariness and lack of sleep as the great blue bus rolled into Pittsburgh at midnight . He drank a cup of scalding pale coffee in the depot , talking to a blond sailor while he waited for another bus . " Travel much ? " the sailor asked casually . " All the goddam time . I do n't live anywhere . " The sailor eyed him curiously . " Now , that 's a funny thing , " he mused . " They told me to join the navy and see the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Would n't that tie ya ? " Again they were swaying through the darkness , leaving behind a fleeting memory of that winter he had walked those very streets with Whitey . He could not sleep now ; the atmosphere had become fetid with the passengers ' breathing and the hot air shot back from the moaning heater . Yet he was dozing when they drew up before a log cabin in the mountains : five o'clock breakfast stop . The cold air cut to the marrow as they dashed for the restaurant . All the passengers were talking together now with a camaraderie reminiscent only of shipboard . Roosevelt and Hoover  --  elections , elections . Is that all they could say ? Did n't they have homes they longed to reach ? The dawn flamed up red and menacing as they descended into Gettysburg . He rubbed the steam from his window and peered out at the neat Pennsylvania farms , so circumspectly surrounded by their low stone walls . Solid and ageless homes , impudently asserting their security . And no middle-western barn was ever so devotedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just above the eave troughs ' . The mountains beyond were like his Berkshires : bare , black trees marched up their slopes , an army of bayonets reaching toward the rising sun .  | Philadelphia , down Broad Street to the gaunt station . Yes , this was too familiar . " Bus for Trenton , Lawrenceville , Princeton , New Brunswick ... " Once , these names had been his . Eagerly he watched for the jigger shop at Lawrenceville . One balmy February day a false note of spring had encouraged him and George Anderson to bicycle over , up this very hill , to eat here among the schoolboys . And Stony Brook now , with those remembered bridges stealing off into forests of green pines about the millionaire estates . They were passing the Washington Monument , and on past the Commons , the banks , the gates of Nassau Hall  --  Dei sub numine viget : It flourishes under the will of God . A big truck was parked across from the moving-picture theater on the corner . Must all his memories be returned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , the bus humming through the great white walls of the Holland Tunnel . Closer , closer at last . He would have to face mother now . Lying in bed , in another 's house . Never to come to their own ? Laura met him at the door . She was plump and not so pretty as he remembered her . Married , with two children and a broker husband , living in Scarsdale . " But why are you ? ? " he asked . There was a curious smell through the dark hall ... . She spoke in a whisper , " I 'm staying here during the week now . " Then Aunt Emily came bustling forward , and as he pecked her cold cheek he remembered the first time he had met her , in this same hall .  | " The operation was n't sucecssful , " she said directly . " Operation ? You did n't tell me ! " Laura laid her hand upon his arm . " Your mother has cancer , Alan , " she said gently . Cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smelled the growing stench , despite the overlaid , cleansing odor of antiseptics  --  bringing him more reality than their sudden , cruel words . Mother was sunk in the bed ; a nurse hovered beside her . Or was it mother ? Her skin had paled to a transparency so that he could almost see her skull . And her black hair was newly streaked with gray : the very elements of her beauty mocked him now . He wanted to turn and destroy them , for presenting him with this picture , and no preparation . A numbness crept over him until he felt his own entrails were dust , and quickly he held out his hands , insanely , to see that they were there , and alive . Laura looked at him with a frightened glance , as if she had been afraid of this within her , too , for she abruptly left the room stifling a sob . Aunt Emily said crisply , " Speak to her , Alan . " When he did , her eyes fluttered open . Suddenly she smiled , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arm ; he rushed to her . He could feel his face contorting to smile in answer . I. " Alan , " she whispered . " Alan . " And he felt a thin , unknown hand upon him . Then she changed . Her other hand went up to her hair ; the nurse quickly propped her higher in  | the bed . " I 've not been recovering very quickly , " she admitted . But he was astonished at the sudden strength of her voice . Everyone in the room was t sformed with her . " Why , she 's getting along fine , " the nur a said with that false cheerfulness of the sickroom . Aunt Emily bustled around , straightening the covers and bringing the vase of chrysanthemums nearer . " Yes , yes , you 'll be fine , " Alan found himself falling in with them . " Why , you 'll be all right . in no time . " " Everything is all right , " mother said . He wanted to cry out , she soured so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not mother ! " Now , you 'd better go before sheds tired . This is very exciting , having you back , " the nurse said in a loud tone , and ushered him out , leaving Aunt Emily behind . " But she  --  first she ? " he began in bewilderment . The nurse shook her head . " It happens this way , " she explained in a professional tone that was somehow reassuring . " First she regains her strength , and then there is a relapse . We never know . Probably it will happen many times . You were sent for only as a precaution . This may go on for weeks , there 's no telling . " " But she ca n't ? ! " he raged . So this was death . Yes , face the word . Death , barring the light from the window with its hand , then blinding you suddenly with the returning , tantalizing glare of life . . . . It was no easier to sleep as the week progressed , and then another week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven back , although he found himself saying with them now , " It wo n't happen tonight . "  | Anton Brohley , who came every day , finally persuaded him to have lunch with him uptown . " If I were you , " he drawled , " no matter how much your aunt resents it , I 'd send for your father now . " Alan was silent a moment ; he had been thinking the same thing . Yet there was a bridge to gap , and mother had not spoken . " You 've loved her , have n't you , Anton ? " he said . " More than we ever did . We , " Alan repeated , astonished . " I 've never thought of it like that , you know . Both father and I have disappointed her . , I never did what she wanted , either .... The least I could have done  --  she had always planned we 'd go to Europe , once I was out of college . Instead of my being so damned headstrong ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . We 'd all do things differently if we lived our lives over . " " I wonder if we could ? " Alan reflected . Now he was about to see father again ; the telegram had been sent , Aunt Emily had been merely silent , and now here he waited at the station . Would he recognize father at all ? The passengers were pouring through the gates , too fast for him to search every one of their faces . " Alan ? " A towering man with gray hair and a black suit which hung loosely on his big frame was half-extending his hand . " Father ! " They shook hands , glancing into each other 's eyes nervously . Of course , father would have changed , after thirteen long years . " You 're taller , Alan . And filled out , since I saw a picture of you last .... It was good of you to send me the wire . "  | The voice was disconcertingly familiar ; how could he have forgotten it ? " Yes , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? she 's better today . It 's always like that , but you never know . " Alan pushed out the words , just to keep on talking . " Here , let 's take a taxi . Is that your redcap ? " Father got in the cab first and Alan gave the address , conscious that he was being looked over . He tried to square his shoulders . " I have n't seen New York in all these years , " father was saying . " It 's not under the circumstances I 'd like to return ... . Where are you working  --  around these parts ? " " No . Everywhere , " he answered bitterly . " I 've been all over , you know . " He wanted to explain so much . " Ca n't get settled ? That 's the way she was . " " But do n't you ever  --  do you think you 're ? ? " Alan challenged him . " Yes . " Quietly , so that Alan felt ashamed . " Yes , I wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of things . " " It 's been a long time , " Alan said futilely , knowing that there was no use talking now , that father was not thinking of him . " Yes , a long time , " father answered absently . " And now it 's too late . " Then they were in that dark hall , and Aunt Emily was leading father up the stairs . Father seemed lost here , too . Alan put one foot upon the stair , and hesitated . No , he should not witness this encounter , the moment was theirs alone . Laura came into the parlor as the gilt clock softly chimed eleven times . For two days they had not been able to persuade  | father to leave mother 's room . And yet she had not once recognized him . " I 've finally got them both to bed , " Laura said , meaning father and Aunt Emily . " I told them we 'd stay up . Your father looked awfully tired . He 's so gentle , Alan , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't mean to . It 's just that it 's hard for both of us , after so long . I ca n't blame him now . " " You must not ever , Alan .... You know , I was remembering Cape Cod tonight . Of course I was n't there so much after you and Aunt Grace came east , " she explained . As if he did not remember . He looked at her : was it possible she had forgotten that final summer 's intimacy ? No , it could not be ; this must be her way of telling him she preferred to believe it had not happened . " Yes , I hardly remember seeing you there at all , " he lied for her . Because that was the way she wanted it . Immediately she was relieved , as if he had helped her lay a ghost . So they were burying the past . " Do you remember , " she went on , " I mean  --  was he still there when you went up  --  old Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to call old Side-Hill Wampus because he walked with such a funny gait ? " " Do I ! " Suddenly they were laughing . " And do you ? " Alan began , but he noticed Laura was biting her lip . In their shamed silence they caught the sound of the sickroom door opening , just a faint creak , and the soft tread of the nurse on the stairs . They rushed out to meet her . " I 've administered adrenalin , but it 's too late , " she said quietly . " You 'd better call them . "  | CHAPTER THIRTEEN A SHEER wall of purple rock mounted steeply from the road where their car was stalled . On the other side an organ cactus partially obscured the view of a fertile valley where a small figure was plowing with two white oxen . Far in the distance were the mountains . Alan could see great Popocatepetl and its companion , Ixtaccihuatl , the Sleeping Woman , their snows already pink-topped from the late afternoon sun . In the last few months he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico . Hugh had walked down the road a way , for once impatient , although Alan felt that was n't exactly the word to describe a man who had spent a good part of his life here . Hugh Longford had been a lifesaver , all right . The day after mother 's funeral he had offered to take Alan with him on this sales survey for a syndicate of interests in New York . Alan remembered father 's perturbed look at the proposal . But then , it had been years since father had traveled . And this was definitely on the up and up , not like the Matto Grosso experience . Good pay  --  better than he 'd ever had  --  and only yesterday Hugh had tempted him with the position as permanent representative for the syndicate here . Their long survey , covering every state in the republic , had been definitely in favor of " development . " Alan pulled his hat farther down over his eyes and watched  | their chauffeur tinkering inside the hood . He shifted his position on the rock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexican straightened up and Alan dreamily observed the one small cloud in all this blue sky , nodding absently at the elaborate explanation of why the car would not go . A vulture was wheeling over the valley , high up , giving scale and a sort of peace to the whole splendid panorama . Hugh always said those zopilotes symbolized Mexico : beautiful at a distance , maybe , but dirty up close . But then , Hugh , for all his real love of the country , was a thorough businessman . ? y no quiere funcionar , " the chauffeur finished with a gesture of futility , and sat down on the running board . " Where are we ? " Alan asked lazily , his eye now following two distant figures and their donkey , slowly winding up the trail in a little tornado of white dust . No se , senor , " the chauffeur replied . " Un cigarillo , por favor . " Alan threw him his cigarettes as Hugh came back to them . He was much older than Alan and his tanned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the tropical sun . " Has n't he got the damned thing fixed yet ? " Hugh asked . Alan chuckled . " It 's the usual reply  --  the engine , it just does n't care to function . ' And of course he has n't an idea where we are . " Hugh swore under his breath and Alan laughed out loud . The whole thing struck him funny . He did n't care when they moved on ; the only difference between him and the Mexican was that he reveled in the sun , basking like a lizard . " Take it easy , " he counseled.  | " This would have to happen when we 're taking a little vacation now , " Hugh objected . " We 'll never reach Acapulco tonight . And I could use a swim right now . If you knew that fine harbor you 'd be more ? " " We 'll get there eventually . We always have . . . . Maybe these people will know where we are . " The figures had come closer . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind who could never buy anything the syndicate had to sell , Alan reflected . But the man in his white " pyjamas " was a fine type . ' What the devil was it that made you respect these people so ? Even if the men did let their women walk ; for of course the man was riding the burro . She was padding along , her bare feet just showing beneath her voluminous skirts . Over her blue rebozo she wore an old straw sombrero ; her man had evidently just bought his at the village market . " Muy Buenos dias , " Alan saluted them , and the man gravely raised his hat . " Adios senores , " he sang , but he did not really mean good-by , because he had stopped his animal . His wife looked frightened . How could they express such servility and yet so completely preserve their dignity ? " It is a very fine day for you to go to market and buy such a very excellent hat , " Alan began . Hugh cut him short . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village ? " he asked them . The Indian took off his hat , revealing a typical cone-shaped head of black hair . He surveyed his hat proudly . The band was handsome tooled leather , which also bound the brim . Obviously it was his only extravagance ; his sandals were no longer separate straps but an indefinite conglomeration on his dirty feet . Yet his clothes were spotlessly white .  | " I did not buy this hat today , senores , " he informed them . " How many leagues ? ? " the chauffeur repeated sharply . He wore a black suit and was much lighter of face , a mestizo . Alan wanted to kick him ; he always acted this way toward the peons because he felt he was several degrees up in the social scale . The Indian scratched his pointed head . " Dos horas ? " he asked them back . The chauffeur cursed and Man asked patiently , " Two hours by foot or by coche ? " Hugh explained their predicament and the Indian was very interested . They could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house was theirs . " Oh , the hell with it ! " Hugh exclaimed , but just then they heard a truck grinding up the steep grade . " Maybe they 're mechanics , " he said hopefully . The next day they were lying on the beach at Acapulco , listening to the constantly rustling palms and the regular thunder of the surf , punctuating their sentences as it boomed and crackled . Alan picked up a handful of sand , letting the minuscule particles of seashells fall glittering amber and pink and amethyst through his fingers . " All the same , " he remarked , " I half-wish they had n't fixed the car and we 'd had to stay in that jacal . " " With the lice and the bedbugs ? Ha , the country 's got you , " Hugh laughed . But Alan knew he was as ready as the next one to sleep on a petate on the hard dirt floor , and eat only beans and tortillas , and drink their pulque . They 'd had to do that more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes from the sun . " And  | we 're trying to change them , making them want things they really do n't need . . . . Peace , " he murmured . " Do n't destroy the illusion , Hugh . Peace here . As if for the first time in my whole life . " " You certainly had a prime case of jitters when I rescued you from the city . " " And I see why now . " Alan leaned on one elbow . " Rushing around the damned country  --  hurry , hurry ! All the time I imagined I was so free , I was really chained , just as if I 'd been in an office . Christ ! But these people are fixed , they 're part of the soil . That 's what I like about them . They do n't want to move . " Silently he thought of what father had said about settling down . " I 'll take this job , Hugh , " he decided abruptly . " You can tell the syndicate when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know the country yet , " Hugh warned him . " It does funny things to different people . It can be violent as hell . " " Yes , the landscape . And I suppose you 'd include bullfights ? But I like them , too . And mountains are old favorites of mine , you know . " " Not only that . You 'll see . " At the end of the week they reluctantly left the hot country on the Pacific and returned to Mexico City , where Hugh wanted to correlate their survey for presentation . It was pretty good to get back to a decent hotel . " Let 's go to Sanborn 's , " Hugh suggested the next morning , " for some strawberries and real , honest-to-God coffee for a change . " It was the middle of Lent and as they walked from their hotel all the little restaurants had signs advertising empanadas  | for sale . They passed the Alameda and crossed San Juan de Letran in front of the National Theater . " My God ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White ! " He ran ahead and caught hold of his arm and was pumping Tom 's hand when Hugh came up . " How 'd you get here ? You look the same  --  thin as a rail , you dog ! They told me in New York you must still be in Paris . " Tom grinned and they went in to breakfast together . Hugh opened a copy of Excelsior and let them talk . " I 've been here almost a year , " Tom explained . " The franc got too high for me . Anyway , this is where things are happening . But , what the hell , Reed , what are you ? ? " " Listen to this , " Hugh commanded . He had been reading about Roosevelt 's inauguration . " And now he 's declared a nation-wide bank moratorium . People ca n't draw out a dime . Guess I wo n't be going back as soon as I thought . " Tom was more interested in the recent events in Germany which had elected a man called Hitler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet all this news , Alan thought , seemed very distant and somehow irrelevant . He was remembering the story Hugh had told him about the man who built this magnificent colonial palace which was now Sanborn 's restaurant . Just to refute his father , who thought him a no-acount , he had erected this mansion as a literal refutation of the old Spanish proverb , " You shall never live to build a house of tiles . " " But why stay here in the city ? " Tom was saying . " I 've got a house in a little village that overlooks the Valley  --  no distance at all . Be damned glad to share the rent , " he added wryly .  | The same old Tom . Yet in some ways he had changed . Alan could n't put his finger on it until Tom dragged them out to see Rivera 's and Orozco 's murals . He was astounded that Alan had not seen them before . " Good Lord , they 're the finest art this hemisphere 's ever produced ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so enthusiastic . The bright panels illustrated all the successive phases of the Revolution : he had forgotten about that . " Your violence , perhaps ? " he asked Hugh . But he instantly responded to these twisted , foreshortened forms shouting with raw color . " That 's it , violence ! " Tom agreed . " They 've smashed these damned blood-sucking Diaz politicos like they smashed the gauchupines , the rotten Spaniards . It 's a new order . " Hugh merely sniffed , but Alan laughed . " Whoa , wait a minute , fire-eater ! " he begged . " Have n't you changed sides ? I thought the mob was beneath you , and so you went off to Paris where intellect reigned . Art and politics seem strange bedfellows to me . " " You 're still back in the Middle Ages , " Tom retorted . " We all had to get over that culture idea in the ' twenties . We do n't write pretty-pretty stuff any more . It 's the Revolution ? " " Oh , my God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let him talk , " Alan said . For all their obvious divergence , he could see Hugh rather liked Tom . The house that Tom had rented was a fine little tile-roofed place on the mountainside , they found , overlooking the town 's bright church domes . Those magnificent edifices always reminded Alan of a rich aunt towering above her poor relations  --  the squat adobe houses with their scaling pink and blue plaster walls . With this view before them , they set to  | work on the veranda , stopping to exclaim over the heavy afternoon storm clouds which purpled the mountains surrounding the high Valley of Mexico , presaging summer rains . When Hugh finally left with the report , Alan stayed on with Tom . He would receive his instructions as soon as the syndicate authorized his position as representative . But he was growing a little uneasy ; the life here was almost too pleasant  --  increasingly so as he stayed on in one town and began to know the people . One afternoon the insistent beating of a drum and the shrill call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town 's annual fiesta , and toward evening they trudged farther up the slope to the church , around which the celebrations were taking place . Little white umbrellas were set up everywhere , half-lighted by the kerosene flares . The church itself was strung with electric bulbs . Alan had seen many more impressive facades , yet this one was charming in its own way . The faded pink walls were overlaid with a latticework design in the usual azul hermoso , the " pretty blue " Mexicans love . Yet this modern paint was merely superimposed upon the colonial architecture , whose integral ornamentation was encrusted about the door , and continued upward to the tower directly above ; from this the dome was apart , seeming to hang in the twilight-blue sky like a gigantic marshmallow . From within its half-lighted interior came the sound of music . Not sacred hymns but popular love songs , the kind they often heard on soft nights in the shadows of any corner , or which floated up to them as the after-midnight serenade of the mananitas . " Playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open  | these churches despite the government 's anti-religious policy . They 've been drugged so long it 's only a vicious habit . " " But is n't this part of their lives , is n't this essentially Mexico ? I 'd like to have such faith . " " You ca n't eat faith . And it 's all right to say they have enough to eat when you sit down to your own groaning board . But here comes the torito . " He never tried to press his point , and Alan respected him for that . The dancers had grown tired of acting out the story of the Moors and Christians , and had discarded their grotesque masks and spangles for the fireworks . The climax was to be the torito , a diminutive bull made of papier mache and bristling with Roman candles and pinwheels . Carrying the object on his shoulders , a man charged the crowd . " Stay back by this tree , " Tom warned . In an instant Alan knew why . As the first fuse was ignited the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the ball of fire , whizzing and gyrating into space , was catapulted in a different direction , changed its course again and shot off above the heads of the spectators . The people laughed and howled , and the bull charged once more while another fuse , lighted by the first , sputtered and sent off its flaming torpedo . This time it came darting straight at Tom and Alan , and with one accord they leaped behind the tree . But again it was erratic , for it sailed away , sizzling angrily . The next thing Alan heard was the piercing shriek of a little boy . The flame had been extinguished in his eye . For a moment no one paid the slightest attention , then his mother went running across , fearless now of the torito , , and clasped the child to her , rocking it back and forth . No one else joined her , nothing happened .  | " For Christ 's sake , let 's do something ! " Alan cried , and they ran toward the mother . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the village doctor to treat the screaming child . They came home very late , and tight . They had not been able to escape from that horrible smell of burned flesh , and the equally frightening inertia of the crowd , confronted by an injury . Alan suddenly realized what Hugh had meant by the violence of the land . It seemed usually to slumber  --  and then came a sudden , inhuman episode such as this ... . One afternoon a few weeks later their sanctuary was invaded by two cars full of Tom 's friends from the city . They came panting up the mountainside , dressed in an odd assortment of clothes , some of the women in blue jeans , most of them in Indian sandals . Their baskets were packed with food for the day , and they took over all arrangements . " You 've been in hiding too long , " they told Tom . Those who were not writers were painters , part of the increasing band of expatriates who had gravitated to this pleasant land . One or two of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreeably low . It had been some time since Alan had met their like , but he knew the breed : they were primarily talkers  --  cantina painters . Immediately they began opening bottles and Alan joined one lanky fellow who sat on the floor in the corner and was attacking his own supply of tequila with singular determination . The fellow handed him a copita , giving Alan the onceover . " Are you an emissary ? " he asked mysteriously . " A what ? " Alan looked blank .  | " Working for the Revolution ? " Alan wanted to laugh . Now it was the Revolution . It used to be Art against the ignorant mob . Paris , however , had grown too stodgy and conservative and expensive ; Mexico was the exciting center of the struggle now , with every wall a revolutionary mural . Alan wanted to ask if this fellow had painted any of them himself . But he simply countered , " And you ? " ? trying to sound suspicious . " Do I look like a capitalist ? Here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poured unsteadily . Presently Alan wandered away to the other groups . They were all talking , talking about one or another crime against the Indians and the downtrodden peons , but there seemed no concerted opinion ; everyone espoused a different idea and was arguing vehemently . Alan could hardly hear himself think above the hubbub . The best thing , he decided , was to get drunk , too . On the terrace a blonde girl was listening to a bearded man . She looked friendly and inviting so he joined them . The bearded man scowled and stopped talking and in a moment stormed away . " He 's mad , " the blonde rejoiced . " Are you part of the Revolution , too ? " Alan asked her . She pressed her leg against his and put her hand upon his arm . " Look , " she pleaded , " he keeps talking about that . I do n't care what they do in Russia or anywhere else . If I want to go to bed with  --  I mean , " she stopped herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Nothing , " Alan agreed . She was obviously on the make and he was n't one to object .  | The sound of water wakened him with a start . He opened his eyes and his head began to pound . Tom was bending over the washstand , sopping his face . Little pieces of remembrance edged forward , dancing to his throbbing pulse . " Oof , " he groaned , and Tom looked around . " Hard night , eh ? Pachita 's fixing us some coffee . " They sat in the noon sunlight in their pyjamas and began to feel slightly better . The whole house smelled of tequila and habanero and stale beer . Empty bottles were all over the place . " That 's your Revolution , " Alan said . " Communism  --  and that blonde  --  seemed pretty important there for a minute . " " I 've got a moral hang-over myself . Drink and lechery are all right in their place , but ? " " I dislike expatriates on general principles , " Alan declared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " There 's something to that , now you mention it . I got a letter this morning from Chicago  --  here , read it . " It was from a friend of Tom 's in an advertising agency there . A Century of Progress , the new World 's Fair , was about to be inaugurated . Everybody was trying to get in on the gravy , but there was a job for Tom in the agency , if he wanted it . " Good joke if I took ' em up , " Tom said . " I have n't been in Chicago since the family left , just before I was through college . And of course , there 'd always be old George Anderson to bait . " Suddenly Alan was homesick . He wanted to be back where people ate hot dogs with mustard and stood in line for the  | movies and bought a new car every year and elected a new party because they were tired of the old , and lived in stuffy , comfortable homes . " By God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 're going to get the hell out of this crazy country and go back where we belong ! " " And be respectable folk , I suppose ? " Tom laughed .  | CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE sounds of a dozen orchestras commingled in the night air  --  music from the spotlighted open-air stage before them and from the length of the Midway , and across the shimmering lagoon . Although hedged in by tables in this cardboard Streets of Paris  --  he and George and his wife Lydia , and Tom and the others  --  Alan could feel the great extent of the Chicago Fair which stretched along the lake front . It was all very familiar to him now . Soon they would be watching the skyrockets soar above the towers with that faint , exciting swoossh , then the crackle as they exploded , and , amid exdamations , cascaded their bright fires into the still waters . Perhaps they best expressed the unreality of this fair which at the end of summer would dissolve . For he still could not become accustomed to the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At least Ed Haywood had , with his Steel House exhibit the one reality , down near the Travel and Transport Building . A modern house , built with the precision of a machine . Millions of houses could be built after the same pattern ; he had visited the automobile assembly line , envisaging a mass production of homes . And Ed had let him in on the ground floor . Patricia Ramsey leaned her red head across Tom to ask  | him , " What do you think of our city by now ? You were frowning so ? " " She 'll ask you that till Doomsday , " Tom predicted , " because she ca n't have anyone making fun of Chicago . Maybe we have n't shown the proper respect , Al . After all , is n't our city motto , I WILL ? " He gestured dramatically and they laughed . Alan wanted to answer : Yes , I like Chicago , because everyone of you has taken me in  --  the whole crowd of you who revolve around my wealthy friend George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is growing fat and is married and has a son  --  God , I ca n't believe it yet ! ? and whose sandy hair is thinning at the temples . For he introduced me to all of you , and we are friends . That 's what I like . I think it 's fine . " It 's fine , " he said out loud to her . He was thinking , too , that Tom always managed to sit between them . George could not stand to be excluded from their conversation . " I wish Ed would come , " he said to Alan . " I 'd like to talk some matters over with you two . " " Oh , business ! " Lydia moaned . Alan was n't sure he cared for her . Always wanting George to go her way , so that this was practically the first time they had managed a party together , despite all George 's promises that it would be the same as ever . Like old times , he had said . But now George was married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act so pompous ! Was he that way in college , Alan ? Do n't you think he 's changed ? " " Hardly , " he told her . But added quite as truthfully , " I saw it coming , though . I knew he 'd make his mark in the world . "  | George looked pained at what he must have considered an indelicate mention of his position . Ever since college he had taken an active part in the Anderson Steel Works ? " up from vice-president , " as Tom put it  --  until two years ago his father had retired to Arizona and he had literally become the Works . His inheritance merely complemented his social position . But , yes , possibly he had changed . " We 've all matured , " George was saying pompously again . " Why , look at Tom here . He was getting to be a regular foreigner , but we got him back . That 's the way it is around here . Chicago 's going to lead the whole damned country out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I never thought I 'd be a gag man , " Tom laughed . The strange thing was , he had n't protested over his advertising job . Alan could n't understand that sudden volte-face . Simply because they were all growing older ? " Every time I go away , I think it 's going to be such fun , " Pat remarked . " But it 's always nicer to come home again ... . Oh , look , boys , here 's your favorite fan dance . " The orchestra sounded off and Miss Sally Rand appeared , the little Egypt of today , displaying her pink body and her yellow hair and her white ostrich plumes , all of them waving languidly , Alan observed , and for the tenth time he was unmoved . Someone slid unobtrusively into the seat beside him just at her dimax ; it was Ed Haywood . " That 's always the way , " Ed remarked sadly when it was over . " People do n't come to see the architecture , but the Midway . " Alan remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Roman bust " you know what I mean , the kind we used to have pictures of in our Latin books ? With  | his tight curly hair . " Except that he wore glasses . " A stiff old Roman , " she thought him . ' Which was true in a way , except that Ed was at the other end of the pole from classicism . With his background of architectural work at the famous Bauhaus at Dessau and his radical ideas of mass production of houses  --  well , all he needed was someone to give the idea a name and sell it . And that , Alan had figured from the very start , was where he came in . Not in his present capacity , showing visitors through their exhibit every day ; that was only background , too , learning from Ed about Frank Lloyd Wright , greatest of them all , who had n't been invited to contribute to this fair . Learning from Ed about volumes and thrusts and tensile strengths , and walls hung on a skeleton of steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pans and hardware to unsuspecting Indians ; this was revolutionary , it had fired his imagination . " Say , Ed , I wanted to see you tonight ? " George began , but they allowed him to go no further . Tom nudged Alan . " Let 's shove off . " It was Saturday night and the bright lanes were crowded . " It 's really a night fair , " they always said to new visitors , and that was true . The sharp , garish planes of the modern buildings , blatant with solid colors in daylight , were now bathed in soft tones . With every darkness they underwent this transformation into insubstantial cubes of rose and jade , turquoise and amber , outlined with endless glowing tubes of neon and highlighted by gigantic , moving spots . But tonight there was some additional , exciting feel to the balmy air . Pat linked her arms through both his and Tom 's . " Tell me , Alan , " she demanded , " what are you and George and Ed doing ? Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | He laughed at her , but found himself explaining how he 'd thought of this idea of tying up with George 's steel plant for mass production of unitized houses , and now he was after them to corral a suitable number of big stockholders . Ed had said tonight it looked very favorable for incorporation . " And of course that means a lot to me , " he finished . He did not tell her his secret anxiety that they would reject his own participation . He was a little abashed at his own temerity . Fifteen per cent of the stock and a fat salary as general sales manager was hitting them pretty hard . " It must be exciting , " Pat said earnestly , " to be in the midst of a deal like that . It 's like playing poker , is n't it ? I mean , you have to gamble everything on your own guess . " He was astounded how well she divined his own thoughts . " Of course , George never gambles , does he ? " she pursued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , Lydia ? " " Yes , she 's grand , and I think she livens him up . She 's always been my best friend . " " That 's a woman 's angle on her , Al , " Tom remarked . They both had had their say about her . " You two are so funny . I should think men would simply rave about that ash-blonde hair of hers . " " Maybe we 're not gentlemen , " Tom suggested . " Personally , I prefer red hair , " Alan said , but she merely laughed , fending off his compliment with that unconcerned way of hers . " You 're both coming out to my house for the week end , " she decided for them . " Now , Alan , do n't say you ca n't . I have my car and you 've got to . " " I 'm already persuaded , " he told her .  | The quiet brilliance of the Sunday morning fell across this terrace of the Ramsey house . Through a break in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the dining room after his solitary breakfast . In the far corner of the garden , Mrs. Ramsey , her face obscured under a wide hat , was moving the sprinkler toward her rosebushes . This North Shore suburb might be a hemisphere removed from the gaudy , nervous fair . He could discern the accretion of years about the place : those shrubs had not been planted overnight for a flashy spectacle , they were part of the soil . Two bricks at the edge of the terrace had worked loose from the old mortar ; they symbolized the same feeling which the worn places on the chintz slipcovers inside gave him . The screen door opened and he turned , expecting the others . It was Mr. Ramsey . " Well , Alan , I see you beat the others down . Have a good time last night ? " " Yes , sir , thank you . Tom 's still asleep . " Last night he had left them eating in the kitchen because he could n't hold his eyes open any longer . They must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdoors , " he said . " It 's such a remarkably fine day . Every time I come out here , it seems so good . Living in those two rooms in town as we do ? " " A home is a great place , Alan . " A sharp yearning went through him . Somehow , his old sense of freedom had come to mean less to him here in Chicago , he could n't understand why . Perhaps George 's being married had made him lonesome . Sometimes he was envious of George .... " How long have you lived in this house ? " he asked Mr. Ramsey .  | " Since before the war  --  long before Pat was born . This was n't even a town when we built . " " It does n't take so many years , does it ? " Alan said , more to himself than to Mr. Ramsey . " In no time at all , it seems as if it had been always , does n't it ? " He was thinking of father , living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a way these city people would never be . Here was the place to make something of yourself ... . Pat came bursting out of the house . " Morning , everyone ! " she greeted them , and reached on her toes to kiss her father 's ear , winking at Alan . " Come on in with me while I have some brunch , " she invited him . " We wo n't wait for Tom . " The sun was pouring in through the dining room , dancing on the pure white china and the crusted silver and playing with the ends of Pat 's red-gold hair . Suddenly he felt so good that he laughed . She tried to open her green eyes wide , making a little face as if she 'd missed something . She shook her head severely . " I 'm not quite awake yet , " she confessed . Her face had that scrubbed , early morning look . " Poor Alan , " she said , " having to eat all alone  --  that 's the way I treat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you want another cup of coffee with me ? " she asked so solicitously that he flushed with pleasure . He liked this breakfast intimacy , with her so fresh from her bath . It was all of a piece with this day . And this sun , which only a little while ago had discovered her in bed , lying curled up : he was certain she curled up when she slept . " Yes , thanks . I 'd very much like having coffee with you , " he said lightly . And now she was the one who was flushing , and quickly she changed the subject , talking rapidly about  | one thing or another with a kind of nervous excitement which was not at all like her . " Well , look who 's finally here , " she exclaimed as Tom came in . He looked at them uncertainly , with half a smile on his face . " I thought maybe you 'd gone in town , " he said to Alan . " Is n't this your Sunday at the exhibit ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy-killer . But speaking of that , do n't you have to write an article before tomorrow morning ? " " Oh , God damn it to hell . " Tom 's voice went downscale . " I forgot all about it , " he said mournfully to Pat . " You do n't have to go right away , do you ? " Her voice was light and careless again ; Alan did n't see how Tom could help but respond . Usually she made him very gay . " We can all play tennis , " Pat suggested brightly . " Yes , " Tom said with no enthusiasm . " Al , why do n't you get what's-her-name ? " " I 'll just watch you two , " Alan announced craftily . He did n't want to get another girl ; Tom did n't have any monopoly on Pat . They went out on the terrace and lay in the sun until Tom stirred impatiently . " Well , let 's play , then , " he said , and they got their rackets and followed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinding white court was screened off by high bushes . Alan insisted they play first . Pat served beautifully . The way she stretched for the ball made him feel good all over , and he wished that the day would never end , feeling not sleepy in the hot sun but more completely alive as he followed the white ball back and forth , hearing Pat 's laughter . She was playing well and effortlessly ,  | so that she tied Tom twice before he won the set . At the end she dropped down on the bench beside Alan , pushing away her hair with the back of her small wrist and fanning herself futilely . " Oh , I 'm pooped , " she exclaimed . " You two play now . " " Maybe Tom 's bushed himself . " " Get over there , Reed . I 'm going to lick the pants off you . " At the end of the first love game , Alan knew he meant it . All right , that was a challenge . He began playing fiercely , smacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pat 's cheers . The games seesawed back and forth ; he was tightening up , not letting even the hard ones go without a try now . He barely won the set . " Want to rest now ? " he asked Tom . " Hell , no . " Tom began playing a soft , slow game that fooled him ; he came back strong when it was his serve . Tom kept the pace . He sent a return sizzling down the line on Alan 's backhand . " Oh , that was inside , Alan , " Pat called , and Tom laughed . Suddenly he was mad . He tossed the ball high and lunged down on it : an ace , Tom did n't even see it coming . He was playing hard now , harder than he ever had in his life , smashing the hell out of the ball . White would n't get another point , he resolved furiously . He was pounding them madly but with a superhuman accuracy that did not astound him but only gave him a strange exultation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smarting , and he could feel little hot-cold prickles all over his body ; the back of his shirt was sopping . From the side lines he heard the added cheers of Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey , and he aced Tom three times in a row . Then Tom came back hard and he was dashing back and forth  | across the court , feeling the sting as he cut the ball , gasping as he recovered and returned . " Game , set ! " Pat was calling out and he stopped dead , feeling the grin spread over his face but unable to move for an instant . Tom was shaking his head . " By God , Al , " he marveled , " the luck 's with you . You were positively uncanny . " They sat on the bench panting , their tongues cottony until a maid brought them cool beer , and it did n't matter that it was this three-point-two per cent that they usually laughed about . " Now I have to go in town , " Tom mourned disgustedly . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Ramsey remarked . " Parasitic , " Tom replied shortly . " They ought to be legislated out of business , like this NRA is doing to long hours . " " Why , what do you mean , Thomas ? " Mrs. Ramsey asked innocently , and her husband frowned . " Feeding on other people , " Tom told her . " It has n't any validity , no legitimate purpose . Now , Alan 's idea of mass production of houses  --  that 's a sound idea . It has a social motive , and to my mind it 's next best to slum clearance . Give the proletariat a decent place to live ? " " They would n't take care of those houses if they had them . They like living together in tenements , " Mr. Ramsey stated very firmly . " Why , if you ? " Pat hastily interrupted , " But , dad , that 's only a temporary job for Tom . Is n't it , Tommy ? He 's writing a novel on the side . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me read any of it yet but Alan says ? " " Yes , " Alan took it up , seeing her distress , " yes , the first chapters are really slick , Mr. Ramsey . It makes you understand there never has been a phenomenon like Chicago  --  big and lusty , not knowing its own strength yet . I keep telling Tom to take me as a model for his average man-on-the-street . We all want to know what 's going to become of us ? "  | " Oh , forget it , " Tom said wearily . He hated having the novel talked about . " I have to go  --  you coming , Al ? " " Mother and dad are driving in , they 'll take you , " Pat suggested . " I 'll drive you in later , Alan . " Tom opened his mouth and then shut it again . " All right , " he said . " , ' , We 'll see you when we come in , " Pat smiled , and the three of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one leg up , plucking the fuzz from her sock . " I do wish he would n't talk that way before father , " she finally said , and she seemed almost angry . Suddenly she hopped up . " Come on , let 's go for a swim . " They walked slowly up to the house as the car pulled away , and went up to their rooms to change . When he came out , Alan found her already in the upstairs hall , waiting for him . She had on a cool green robe that knocked his eyes out . The words he wanted to say then did not come ; he felt tongue-tied and although she looked at him curiously , as if he had stopped in the midst of a sentence , they did not say a word as they crossed the lawn and took the path to the foot of the bluff . He turned to help her off with her robe , but instead he put his arms around her and turned her about . When he tried to kiss her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beat you in ! " she cried , and dived into the water . Puzzled , he waited until she came up and then dived near her . " Why ? ? " he asked , treading water , but she would not  | answer . In anger , he swam away . The water braced him , and he headed out into the lake . Faintly he heard her call from the dock . Well , let her wait , damn it . She need n't pretend he was poison . " Alan , come back ! " He took a stroke or two before he circled , doing his best crawl for her until he felt like a small boy showing off . That made him laugh and by the time he hauled himself out onto the dock he felt in better humor . She offered him a cigarette and they sat down , swinging their legs over the side . " I 'm sorry , " she apologized . " But you see , I ? " " Guess I must have been playing out of turn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? she began laughing ? " I know I should n't think it 's funny , it really is n't , only ? " " Well , what about Tom ? " he suddenly guessed . " He did n't say anything to you , surely he did n't ? " " No . " " He asked me to marry him , Alan . " His thumb and second finger sent the cigarette sailing in a wide arc toward the water ; it hit with a faint hiss . " Well , that 's funny , " he replied mirthlessly . " What do you think of that ? " " It 's pretty swell for him . About the finest thing that ever happened to him , that 's certain . " " But I 'm not going to . I just decided not to . I 've been struggling all day  --  maybe you guessed . " " I was a little dense . But maybe , " he began talking faster now , " maybe it was because I 've been thinking too hard myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a root . " " A root ? " " Yes , a root . Like the kind tied to the bottom of a tree . I got to thinking of it for a lot of reasons . You and your family and George  --  yes , George got under my skin  --  and Tom . All of you belonging someplace , belonging here . And then Ed 's been talking about our putting up a Steel House out here ? " " Stop ! You are n't making sense at all . " " No , it would n't make sense to you , because you 've had it  --  I mean , a home and roots in a place and friends all your life . I used to laugh at those ideas . " " And you do n't laugh any more ? " " I do n't know whether I do or not . It 's just that they go with  --  with the other thing . This is pretty new to me  --  damn it , what I 'm trying to say is , Pat , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Would it help if you kissed me now ? " she asked softly .  | CHAPTER FIFTEEN PAT stood at the window of her mother 's apartment , gazing down thoughtfully on Lake Shore Drive as it curved north around the Oak Street beach . The lead-gray waves brushed up against the shore coldly ; out to the east black-edged clouds were forming . Perhaps they would have snow ! Her heart gave a little pleasurable jump . January had been so frightful and drab : even Alan had been gloomy , ever since the other night at the movies . There was the faint hum of traffic as it moved toward Lincoln Park , the exhausts like small white plumes waving saucily in the cold air . Pat never failed to appreciate this view ; somehow it went with a cold winter day . Yet she missed the boom of her lake ; from this height its sounds were lost beneath those of the cars . It was n't the same lake which for so many years she had seen from the family 's house on the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house being sold . Of course , mother was probably right . As soon as father died last September , she had said she did n't want to stay out there any more . Yet by this decision they had lost something , irretrievably . Perhaps it was quite silly of her ? but a house that you 've lived in all your life ... She left the window to search for a cigarette . Even what remained of the furniture , what could be crowded into this apartment , no  | longer looked the same . Just too , too plush , as Alan always remarked . And she had been the one to persuade mother to keep it ; mother had wanted to buy all new things . There was still that painting of them over the fireplace , the way it had been at home . For the first time in years Pat stood off and actually studied the portrait of herself and Connie . Connie looking so serene and aloof even then , and not any more blonde than now . Connie , who had deserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Pat had made her debut . She had never seemed like a sister , really , because she was so much older ; Pat had n't seen her since the wedding , except for father 's funeral , because Connie lived in Connecticut now and hated Chicago . She always had . But there had been a time , just after they had sat for tedious hours while Mr. Tollerev did their portrait .. . Mother had commissioned the painting for father 's birthday , and on that night Pat had worn the same little green frock , coming just to her knees ; she even remembered those socks and the patent-leather shoes that cracked if you wiggled your toes , and the way her bangs , which she was still wearing then , felt against her forehead when she wrinkled her brow . She had been sitting in the living room with the curtains drawn so that she could not see her beautiful lake ; but one on the other side was left open a crack , so they could see father when he came up in the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the window . Everything had been so expectant and safe and still , just the crackling of the big oak logs as they blazed . Then Connie had come in with both their little presents for father , and mother after her , whispering how they would lead him in to see the portrait which was just hung . They would be allowed to stay up long  | enough to greet the guests who were coming for dinner . She would know all of them , and Mr. Trumble would chuck her under the chin and tell her a message that Lydia had sent . But most comforting was this very moment , with just her family gathered around . And even Connie  --  she remembered so well  --  had said , " You bring father in , Patty . You do it . " Nothing had ever thrilled her quite so much , in such an indescribable way . And then she had loved her sister and her mother and father and everyone more , more than ever before .... " Well , Patricia . " She heard that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , taking off her hat and handing it to the maid . They kissed quickly . " It 's getting colder , " Mrs. Ramsey observed . " My , I 'll be glad to get away ! I 'm sailing earlier , I think I told you . " " Why , mother ! You did n't say a thing ? " " Well , I am . Mrs. Davidson and I decided we might as well . " " When ? Maybe we should regret . . . I came by to tell you we could n't come to dinner this Friday . Florence and Lloyd are having a party , so if you do n't mind ? " They almost always came to dinner on Fridays , particularly since father had died . Pat had told Alan , and he quite agreed , that it was the least they could do for mother . Yet mother seemed hardly to notice . " That 's perfectly all right , dear . I really should have some people before the lecture  --  I owe dozens and dozens of invitations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I still would feel better if you 'd go down from Paris instead of through the Mediterranean right now . "  | " Fiddlesticks . . . . Patricia , are n't you well ? " Automatically Pat put her hands up to her face , then was annoyed at being tricked . " Mother ! Of course I am  --  I 'm fine ! " Mrs. Ramsey was surveying her daughter critically now . " I do n't know , " she said brusquely . " I thought perhaps  --  Pat , you are n't going to have a baby , are you ? Because if you are  --  we 've engaged the villa until at least April , but if ? " " Oh , mother , for  --  goodness sake ! " There she was , jumping at conclusions again ; sometimes these last few months it was really a trial to talk to her . But these words were startling . Of course , Pat was quite sure she was n't going to have a baby  --  only , she had been wondering , just this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right after they were married , she must not have been in very good physical condition , or something ; then they had deliberately put it off . About a year ago they had tried , but then somehow she had grown afraid , and Alan was n't at all insistent . He said they could n't take trips if they had a small baby . But now .. . " I 'm perfectly all right , " she told mother hastily . " Except I 'm worried a little about Alan . All this month he 's seemed so restless . He 's been awfully busy ? " " You certainly do n't think presenting him with a baby will calm his nerves , do you ? " That was a typical remark of mother 's , disregarding what you said and going right along with her own train of thought . " I do n't know where you ever got such an idea ! " Pat cried in real exasperation now . " Alan needs a change , I think , " she went on , determined to divert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have any vacation last summer . "  | " We really did n't care . Alan 's all right when he can play golf and have lots of exercise outdoors . " " There 's only one thing for you to do  --  go on a cruise . That 's much better than having a baby ? " " I do n't think we can afford a cruise . " " Now , Patricia ! You just let me do this for you . I 'm going to live for nothing this winter . I 'll call up that nice man down at the travel agency and he 'll  --  when can you go ? " " Please , mother ! You know how Alan is . " Still , it was a temptation , a very great temptation . Mother could n't possibly use all her income now ; anyway , eventually , it would be theirs , hers and Connie 's . " Remember your father , " Mrs. Ramsey said . " He was always too busy to get away . Now , I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do a great many things before you have any children ? " " Oh , God , mother ! " " ? before you have any children , " Mrs. Ramsey went on , imperturbably . " I know that 1 wish I 'd waited longer before having your sister . Not that I could help it  --  I was very young and innocent and they did n't know so much then . " Pat was shocked ; she did n't know why , except that it was mother , talking this way . Mother had never spoken quite like this while father was alive . " Well , let me talk to Alan , " Pat relented . " I stopped by this morning because I thought you might like me to have lunch with you . " " My dear , I 'd love to have you . You stay , and tell Margaret what you want . But I just have to go out ? " Pat felt the slightest bit offended . " I was only doing it because we could n't come Friday , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have lunch with him . "  | " Why do n't you call up some of your friends ? " mother suggested . " That 's just what I intended to do , " Pat answered quickly . She wished mother would let her alone . Except , she confessed deep inside as she dialed Lydia Anderson 's number , that was exactly the reverse of what she meant . Mother seemed so very , very different these days . Not even telling her she was sailing earlier ... . When the doorman tipped his hat to her and she felt the first cold blast of air , she breathed it with relief and a real enjoyment . Oh , well , it did n't matter , and Lydia was glad to go out to lunch . With little effort she pushed her misgivings into the back of her mind . The bustle of the Avenue thrilled her , as it always did . She had half an hour to kill before she met Lydia ; and she never had time enough to window-shop . Tonight she would very tactfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother had offered . The more she thought about it , the more sensible it seemed . A trip was exactly what Alan needed . Her eyes were drawn across the street to a window of bright cruise clothes . The policeman 's whistle gave that familiar , that peculiarly Chicago sound , whreet-a-whreet , and she crossed with the pedestrians . The resort clothes looked even lovelier than ever this year  --  and Alan liked her best in that kind of thing . But she was n't going for herself ; she 'd show him how very little she would need to buy . He would tell her she must have them , and instead she 'd get out last summer 's " Hello there , stranger , " someone said behind her . She turned . It was Tom ' White . " Well , stranger yourself ! "  | She pulled away her muff and squeezed his hand . " Is n't this wonderful weather ? Why do n't you come out to us ? We have n't seen you in perfect ages ! " she reproached him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south . " He motioned toward the window display . " Just wishing . Except maybe we might take a cruise . Alan needs to get away . Does that sound horribly capitalistic to you ? Or are you still on that ? ? " He said he was still on that labor paper . " How 's Al ? " he wanted to know . " Too busy for his own good . You ought to go see him . I wish you would . Maybe you could convince him he ought to get away . " Tom shoved his gloveless hands into his coat pockets . " He 'd say he was too busy . That 's the fallacy , the tragedy . " " You have n't changed at all . Sounding like Hamlet , Tommy . " " Or a modern Faustus . " " Oh , stop it ! Are you coming to Florence 's dinner on Friday ? " " No . " Pat looked at him with mock disgust . " If you 're not going anyplace , let 's walk along  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm . " Really , you should go , Tom . You never accept invitations any more . " The feel of her arm against his had gone through him like a shock . He tried to deny it to himself and out loud he said , " They 've gone their way , and I , mine . We 've nothing in common . " " Do n't be silly ! " She knew he had always said things like this and she did n't believe it any more now than formerly .  | " They 're your old friends , " she persisted , " our old friends , " she added more to herself than to him . " No , I 'm just a dirty Red to them . " " Of course they 'll talk if you do n't ever show yourself around ! " " What 're you doing  --  goading me ? " " Yes , I am . And you do n't care . But I do . " She does n't mean that , he thought bitterly . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have n't they enough in their lives without bothering about me ? Why should they care ? It seems to me they must be awfully hard up for something to think about ? " " It 's not that , it 's because we all grew up together . " So that was it . He damned himself for wincing at her reason . And now she was making it worse by asking about that novel . " What novel ? " he challenged her . But she knew he remembered ; her presence alone vividly brought back the whole summer . It was a little incredible now that he had asked her to marry him , almost four years ago . She had never believed he really cared . And if she had ? " You could do it , " she was saying now . " Those first few chapters ? " God damn it all , why did she persist ? She was leading him down avenues he had long put out of his mind . Those things no longer mattered . As a person , he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance upon themselves , instead of how useful they could be . She kept talking as they approached Chicago Avenue and the old water tower . He could not keep up with her volubility and her good nature . Yet she was making him tell her what he was doing ? " All right , if you wo n't write a novel ,  | what is it about this paper that excites you so ? " she challenged him . Finally he was able to laugh with her . " You know , " he said , " you remind me of a mural by Diego Rivera I saw in Mexico . " He laughed again , at the incongruity of one aspect of the comparison . " Not physically , of course  --  you would n't be flattered . This mural 's in what used to be a chapel  --  a great , bulbous naked Indian woman . Enormous . To Rivera she symbolized the Earth Mother . " Pat started at the word " mother , " but then she laughed . " Yes ? " she urged him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her now . " It 's propaganda for the Indians , of course . This earth goddess , though , always struck me as having decidedly human attributes . In a universal way . Y'see , Rivera meant her to stand for all womankind . Fertile and stable . I ca n't remember accurately , but as I picture it now , the men about her must be very small . Because she is the one who makes man , the natural wanderer  --  the nomad of antiquity  --  change his ways . Persuading the hunter to become a raiser of crops . And of course man has always been a little skittish , even scared ? " " So I 'm like that ? " She laughed again , not at all perturbed . But did he mean , he was glad that he had escaped from her ? " Why am I , then ? " she asked seriously . He refused to enlarge upon the idea . He was vaguely aware that she was leading him past the street he should have turned down . Now she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , look over there , will you ? " She motioned across the street . He could see nothing but a handful of people , waiting for a bus , huddled like sheep against the wind that was sweeping down Michigan Avenue . " I mean , the assortment ! " she cried .  | " Just think what their stories are . If you knew them , all of them , every little thing about them  --  you 'd have Chicago ! You could do that . You only pretend indifference . " He was surprised . " What you mean is , you 'd like me to explain Chicago to you ? " " Yes . If I could only put down all I feel . It 's our town , Tommy . I was thinking this morning ? " He shook his head . " Nope . Among other things , I have n't your eye for that sort of detail . You relish it , do n't you ? " It was her turn to be surprised . " Why , yes . Yes , I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzled tone , for it had never struck her quite that way before . Oh , it was still all hers , no matter if mother .. . " Look , I 've really got to say good-by , " Tom was saying . He slipped his arm out from hers , and shook her hand . " But I 'll see you soon  --  you will come to Florence 's ? You 'll ' phone and tell her you 've changed your mind ? Come on , be a sport . We all want to see you . " He shrugged . " Why not ? " It was she who went away from him , leaving him on the cold street corner . A newspaper slewed across the gutter and swiped his trouser leg . He was wondering why he had promised . You damned fool , White , you 're losing your grip , he apostrophized himself . Suddenly , this cockeyed compulsion again . But a compulsion in the wrong direction . . . . Well , she 'd see ; it would do no good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He turned and went swiftly down the side street to a drugstore . Inside , he began thumbing through the dirty suburban ' phone book for Florence Trumble 's number .  | CHAPTER SIXTEEN FoR several days it had been threatening to snow . But not until today had it actually arrived to cover the vast gray shoddiness of the city . By the time Alan was walking to his train through the Loop in the early winter darkness , the white blanket was already dirty and rumpled . The snow had been smudged by soot , mashed and smeared under the wheels of traffic until he wondered if there was anything that the city did not spoil . Out in the suburbs he found it a different thing , idyllic , a Christmas-card sort of scene . Pat was beside herself as she and Alan drove over to Florence and Lloyd Trumble 's . The car slithered into the drive , and the fir trees , their branches weighted low , showered the windshield . Pat grew silent as they approached the house . Reminding Alan that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? to her family 's old home . At least , he often tried to tell her , it was better for Florence and Lloyd to have bought it . But that seemed only to make the matter worse . What would it feel like , he wondered , to live in one house for such a length of time ? With the same inability to visualize he thought of father in Lawsonville , no longer trying to reconcile his memories there , embalmed , unused in an unvisited town ... . At the door Pat resented the maid 's instructions please to go upstairs , the first bedroom to the right . As if she did n't  | know , her sharp heels seemed to beat out on the stairs . Alan smiled and turned to greet Florence who had come into the great hall . Here would be his friends , too  --  not just Pat 's any longer . But he had had so many friends , all of whom had vanished . Most of the people here tonight would be familiar , yet to be perfectly candid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he realized how very little . He took Florence 's hand warmly ; she was better than the rest , far better than her sister-in-law Lydia Anderson . A good sport , and square . Unfortunately , this was never worked a day in his life . Across the big living room he saw Tom and waved , thinking how strange for him to be here . Pat was downstairs again and Alan was drawn into her group , having a cocktail poured for him , listening with half an ear to what was being said . Somebody was going to have a baby . The Griffons were being transferred to St. Louis ; Bob Griffon had been given a promotion . And Lloyd stopped long enough on his way around with the cocktail shaker , to say that he heard they had some pretty fine horse races in Rio . " I 'm finally getting him away from Havana , " Florence was laughing . Sometimes , Alan suspected , she must have her hands full with Lloyd  --  good old , jovial Lloyd . It had been a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pretty soon , Alan bet himself , Lloyd would have the largest collection of race-track films in the country . Now Alan heard them talking to him . " You 've just got to come with us . It wo n't take any time at all on this boat and we can ? " He smiled faintly and shook his head . No , they could n't  | make it . . . . But God , just the very thought of Rio again . Even by way of a stupid cruise . Once more to see the Corcovado and the Sugar Loaf . To go back there and erase what had happened the first time , too . And if he could show Pat , let her see with her own eyes those towering , tropical green mountains above those magnificent blue bays . . . They said there was a colossal statue of Christ on the Corcovado now , and that Rio looked like a different city , all modern architecture and new apartment houses in place of the baroque and jerry-built affairs he remembered . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was happening in the construction line in South America . " No , I ca n't get away , " he repeated steadfastly . That was positively settled ; that was what he had told Pat this week . Pat said , " He 's got an awfully big deal on right now . I wish we could go for his sake , but honestly , I do n't care . Because , look at this snow ! I 'm just like a child about it , really . Do you know what I did today ? The Hampton youngsters were making a snowman , and I could n't resist going out and helping them . Oh , it was a beautiful thing , with two shining lumps of coal for eyes and I found an old hat ... " They were all laughing now . Alan felt sick and disgusted  --  and , yes , unsuccessful . Because Pat was covering up for him , saying he was so busy . She could n't possibly get such a kick out of this winter . She knew well enough they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't let Mother Ramsey pay their way . God damn it , was he losing his grip or had n't he got so far after all , that she should have to cover up ? It was no help to realize that she knew he 'd been feeling low  --  telling him , " Alan , you simply must get away . " He  | could hardly explain that a cruise would afford only temporary relief , at best , for whatever was eating him . Something was , he had to admit . He was worried about that  --  well , vision , which had attacked him the other night as they came out of the movies . The same thing had happened again : little bits of memory flaring up before his unwilling eyes like sunspots . Made him think he was crazy . It was n't rational , it was n't even like him . Night before last when he and Pat had gone to bed  --  those visions came at the God damnedest times ! Quietly he eased away from their talk and sought out Tom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and made no concessions . Probably living on next to nothing a week ; the way he was wolfing hors d'oeuvres and allowing Lloyd to replenish his cocktail glass looked as if he had n't tasted decent food in months . " Hi , Al . " " Hello yourself . What 's news ? " He was trying to analyze what change of feeling came over him , just being with Tom . Down to brass tacks . Elemental : perhaps that was the word . Tom could see Alan was perturbed about something . Well , at least he could n't feel as funny as he felt ; and he wondered why the hell he had come tonight . These people .... It had been a mistake , it had n't been a good idea . Coming to the same house where he had been years ago , when these young matrons were fluttery sub-debs . This house , where Pat . . . " What 's the trouble , Al ? " He had to make some remark . " Oh , hell . A fellow  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying much attention to what he said . " Boy , I guess they 've got you under pressure . " " What ? " Alan listened .  | " They 've put the heat on you . The more you 've got to give , the more they want . You ca n't back out of it , either . " " Who 's putting it on ? " " Nobody in particular . Just , they . You ca n't ? " " The hell I ca n't ! " Alan denied vigorously . " Say , excuse me , fellow , I 've got to ? : ' he murmured absently and walked off across the room to George Anderson . Tom shook his head sadly and helped himself to more hors d'oeuvres . Alan began talking before George could say a word . " Say , listen , George , I want to ask you . This deal ? " He was suddenly filled with determination . Why could n't the deal be put across ? " That guy ! " George exclaimed angrily , paying no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puffing out he could n't have better expressed his exasperation . " Did you see that guy ? " he demanded . Alan followed his stare . " Wilson Brent ? Yeah , that bastard . Tried to come in and sell me his legal services last week . Acted as if we were old pals . . . . About this ? " " That bastard ' is right , " George fumed . " By God , I ca n't go anywhere without seeing him . Even in my own house . " " Well , freeze him out . He 's nothing . " " How the hell can I , when he 's going around with my sister ? If she  --  I 'm scared to death they 're engaged , Al . " Alan saw he would have to let George get over this . Wilson Brent was a notorious sponger , a young lawyer who had recently landed in Chicago on his own two feet , and was making the most of his " contacts . " Alan recalled Pat 's retailing some gossip about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year 's prettiest deb , but because she was  | an Anderson , George 's sister . The trouble was , Gloria had already had several escapades ; she seemed out to plague her conservative brother , who even hated to see his name in the paper for attending a dance . " She 'll get over him , " Alan prophesied gently . Just the way she had got over the cowboy and the Italian second officer on that cruise ship last winter . George let his grumbling coast to a stop . " I 'd like to tell him where the hell to head in . " " Then he 'll hang on , tighter'n a leech . He 's that kind . Listen , I wanted to talk over this Browne and Geddings deal ? " " That construction company in Philly ? Did you get it ? Good boy . " George showed no enthusiasm . " God , no , not yet . They 've asked us to resubmit our bid . That 's what I wanted to . . . We have n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could  --  it 's the biggest thing we 've ever run into ! " " Whole damned thing 's crazy . If the government would let us alone for a while ... There 's another guy I 'd like ? " " Listen ! " Alan demanded . " Do n't get off on Roosevelt now , for Christ 's sake . You know damned well his Housing Act is going to save our lives  --  or will before long . " " How ? " " Oh , hell ! I 've told you before . Now listen . This Browne and Geddings formed a special company under the Act , y'see ? They secured insurance on a mortgage  --  millions , I ca n't tell you exactly how many now , twelve or fifteen  --  so they could finance this block of low-rental houses . That 's where we came into the picture . Most of these companies go in for slum clearance with apartments . They 're going to try this other stunt . It 's our big chance ? "  | " All right , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to pare down our costs . In the original bid , Ed planned too many conveniences for low-rental units . We can still cut our profits , too ? " " Whoa ! Boy , you do n't know . We 're in for another depression . If the administration ? " " What 's the use of your crabbing like that ? You 'd think you were bankrupt . " If he had half  --  a fifth  --  of George 's money , he would n't be hesitating about any cruise ! " You do n't know what you 're saying , " George repeated stubbornly . " I do n't want to be a wet blanket , Al  --  honestly I do n't . But you ca n't count on your supply costs . How do we know where we are , with a government laying down a plush carpet for labor ? " " Your men out at the plant are n't going to ask for any more than they 're paid right now . " " How do I know ? And boy , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to let any ? " " I know , George , I know , " Alan soothed him . " The thing is , Lewis and his ? " George sought in vain for a contemptible enough epithet " ? his C. I. O. are going to tackle Little Steel next . And that means us . Now that they 've got the motors tied hand and foot . You 'll see . " " Well , what can you do about it ? " " Do ? " George nearly exploded . " Do ? Al , we 'll close down tighter'n a drum . Then you wo n't be able to guarantee deliveries , even if you get the bid . That 's what . " " Your'e a big help , " Alan retorted somewhat bitterly . He was glad that Florence was herding them into the dining room now . Halfway through his soup he remembered what Tom had  | said . Was n't he simply confessing that they held him captive when he got into a lather ? He would n't let these people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table , having a fine time . Well , maybe he was wrong . He did n't actively disapprove of them as Tom did . They were merely unimportant . And they were deserting Pat , too : going away for the winter , moving to St. Louis , swimming out of her ken one way or another . Worst of all , here he was , standing still .... After dinner George felt in a less pessimistic frame of mind . He recognized that he had been a little hard on Alan , who certainly had his troubles coping with Ed Haywood down at the office . Ed was too much of a dreamer to suit George 's taste . And Alan had the stuff in him : he could sell an atheist a stack of Bibles . Right from the start , George had known that . But , Christ , these fellows did n't take into account what he was up against . They thought he loved it , every minute . That the money just flowed in . Well , he 'd like to show them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't have any responsibilities . None of your sissy cruises or those damned horses Lloyd was always talking about . If he could be free , George mused , he 'd show them : make a real expedition , up the Congo or something , as he 'd always wanted to do . Of course , Lydia would n't like that .... Anyway , he could n't . But sometimes he wished he could tell them , without sounding funny . Tom and Alan were talking together and he went up to make amends . " Say , " he asked them , " do you guys know what year this is ? What 's going to happen next June ? "  | Tom said , " I hate to think what June may bring , " and Alan merely shook his head . " Why , our tenth reunion , you blokes ! How about making it a party and going down ? " " An old grad before his time , " Tom laughed . " Want to live over the scenes of your childhood , Georgie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the beer , would he ? " George asked Alan . " If I had a nickel for every time we put you to bed ! " He could n't understand their lack of enthusiasm . Why , hell , the friends a fellow made at college .... Take Tom . Tom did n't give him any credit at all for burying the hatchet and not talking about Roosevelt or labor . " You still with that paper ? " he asked Tom , trying to frame his question in a diplomatic tone . Tom nodded just as some of the others joined them . Wilson Brent jovially put his hand on George 's shoulder . " What 's all this ? " he asked brightly . George gritted his teeth and pretended not to notice . He 'd give this Brent the cure . " I suppose you know a lot of working men , do n't you , Tom ? " he asked with careful casualness . " Sure . Why ? " Tom wondered what was coming . He was vaguely afraid that this would turn into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He should never have come tonight ; he knew that now . " They 'd sure as hell kick the pants off somebody who started to chisel in , would n't they ? " George asked . He was pleased with himself , although maybe this was too subtle for Brent . " Sure . Why ? " Tom repeated warily . George went on , " Some fellows do n't know when they 're not wanted , though . They 'll try to get anything out of you .  | Sell you anything . Butt in . Or use you  --  your name , for instance . " Brent laughed . " Say , you 're sitting on the wrong side of the fence , are n't you , George ? " " George knows where he stands , " Alan broke in curtly . He was angry with both of them . It was plain as a pikestaff what George was driving at . Maybe Brent was tough-skinned enough to disregard it . But Tom was getting into the argument . " Would you hire scabs ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk ? " " He does n't mean ? " Alan interposed hastily , but it was too late . George was offended with Tom 's curt tone . " I 'm just thinking out loud , " he tried to say mildly . " All this labor situation  --  we 're avoiding the issue . The other day I was reading about brain surgery ? " " I guess there are n't enough doctors to go around if you started that , " Brent put in his oar again . George simply eyed him coldly . To hell with that damned guy . This had reminded him of something he had been wanting to get off his chest . " The trouble is , they 're too many rotten jobs in the world that have to be done . Coal mining , for instance . " " Or steel milling , " Tom suggested . Brent chuckled . " Well , all right . But all sorts of jobs , I mean , that no one wants to do , do they ? A lot of unpleasant jobs . Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he does n't like it any better . Of course , most of ' em do n't care , I admit . But it kind of gets me .... Now , I was thinking , why could n't we segregate a certain number of people , cut out  | half their brains so they feel practically nothing , sterilize them , and use them as  --  what 's the word ? Drones . Make ' em a race by themselves . Then we would n't have any more or less sympathy for them than for a herd of animals . Feed ' em well . Make all the rotten jobs a kind of de-humanized ? " " My God , what fascism ! " Tom suddenly howled . Two or three of the girls at the other end of the room turned and looked at them . " When it comes to that , " George retorted , " I guess we 're just scared of a word . I think we 'd all prefer fascism to communism . Any day . Matter of fact , a good many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any . " You 've said a mouthful there , " someone agreed . Alan snorted . He 'd had just about enough of this reactionary attitude for one evening . Swearing at the government , saying , No , no , we ca n't do this or that .... " Just remember , we 're still a free country . We can still think what we please , " he reminded George . " He does n't know what he 's talking about , Al , " Tom said , very quietly . It was more effective than if he 'd lost his temper . George glared at them both now . From Tom , he could expect that sort of talk . By God , he did n't know what was what . He 'd never worked in a steel mill . Just wrote a lot of phony articles . But Alan . He looked at Alan suspiciously . Those two had been down in Mexico a long time together . Alan was a hell of a good salesman , but maybe he was n't quite balanced enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked like that . Florence guessed there was something wrong . " Let 's play bridge , " she called to them . " There 're just enough for four  | tables . Lloyd can get some drinks . " The tension was eased and everyone began talking at once , relieved . Tom looked at Alan . " Think I 'll skip out , " he said . " I do n't blame you . " The incident had left a bad taste in Alan 's mouth . Maybe it was because everything seemed wrong tonight . But he knew the rest of the evening was something only to be endured .  | CHAPTER SEVENTEEN ALAN passed through the revolving door into the University Club , and nodded as the doorman pegged his name on the board . " Mr. Anderson come in yet ? " " Not yet , Mr. Reed . " He walked over to the check room ; while he waited for the attendant he blew his nose fiercely . Nasty weather ; he hoped he was n't catching a cold . The snow of last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had not been washed away by the rains which were flooding the Ohio River Valley , lay encrusted and black upon the edgings of curbstones or up some shadowed alley . Damp gray fog blew into the canyon of Loop buildings , and although it was just lunchtime , the lights had been on in his office all morning . It was thoroughly miserable weather . Men sneezed and coughed on the trains , and every day more people Alan knew came down with the flu or grippe or lingering colds . The office smelled of mentholated medicines ; his skin itched from the dry steam heat ; his ears rang from the incessant hiss of the radiator and its infernal knocking . Yesterday he had had to send one girl home with a bad case of sniffles . It was the time of year to clear out . And maybe they could go on that cruise , after all . Ed was easy to handle , if you did it diplomatically . Alan was pretty  | encouraged about the way they had pared down expenses for their second bid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went up the broad staircase and turned into the great lounge . He 'd wait here until George came ; they had a regular date to have lunch together and play squash on Saturday afternoons . Then usually , or so it had been all this fall and winter , they met the girls and went someplace in the evening . Tonight they were going to the six-day bike race . A wave of well-being invested Alan as it always did when he entered the club : the rich , dim wainscoting of dark polished wood ; the soft carpets ; the great leather chairs and sofas here in the lounge ; the tall mullioned windows which gave upon the lake . When the H-Y-P had folded up , they 'd come over here and joined the older men 's club . George 's father had always belonged  --  it probably meant nothing to him  --  but there was something peculiarly satisfying to Alan about it . Here best of all he recognized what Pat felt ; she had protested when he once thought of resigning , to cut expenses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eaten with her father in the ladies ' dining room ; and now it was a place to meet her friends on the afternoon of the symphony . Besides , it was the only way he could be assured of any exercise at all during the winter . He picked up a magazine from one of the tables and went over to the windows . People were hurrying along , up and down Michigan Avenue . Everything was gray : catercorner across the street the Art Institute looked especially dirty , its streaked walls and grimy cornices a fit place for the dull pigeons which glided slowly above the roof or alighted on the pediment , huddling there against the damp cold . Just  | beyond , toward the lake , thin wisps of smoke came from the half-hidden tracks of the Illinois Central . Even the lake , despite one silver streak where the pale sun had found a way through the clouds and mist , looked evil and menacing . Alan let his eye follow the distant shore line along the outer drive toward the Field Museum and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago the second edition of a great , gaudy fair had stretched from that point southward . At the very thought of those pavilions and open-air restaurants , at this incongruous remembrance on such a gloomy day , he shivered . It seemed such a long , long time ago . For an instant he felt very old and tired  --  as if everything lay behind him . It was because of this damnable weather ... . Suddenly George was there . His face looked drawn and old , too , and Alan had the curious feeling that they had been thrust forward in time to a future decade . And here they were , still meeting each other on Saturdays . George did n't seem to know what to do with his hands . His double-breasted coat was open and he kept slipping his fingers in and out of his vest pockets as if searching for some memorandum . " I 've got something to tell you , " he said gravely . " Let 's eat in the Cathedral room . " This was unprecedented extravagance on George 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was up . The headwaiter found them a table in one corner of the capacious hall with its graystone piers leading to splendid groin vaults high above , the walls decorated with the subdued colors of college shields . From the window by their elbows an even wider view of the lake opened out . They had ordered and the waiter had brought them their food before George would talk . Then he told it to Alan 's  | unbelieving ears . This morning in Tom 's labor paper had appeared an " interview " with George , as president of the Anderson Steel Works , detailing every last thing he had said at Florence 's dinner last week . Alan laid down his fork . " You mean , your idea about the workers  --  cutting out half their brains , all that stuff ? " " And sterilizing them . The whole works . " George 's voice was hoarse , as if he had been talking a great deal , but it was singularly devoid of any emotion now ; Alan noticed that especially . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't anything else to say . Finally he murmured , " To think that Tom would write ? ! " " To think that he 'd treat a friend in a dirty way like that , " George supplemented . He seemed stunned rather than angry . " I do n't see how he could have  --  surely he did n't . Not Tom . " " Well , it 's there . " Alan began to eat listlessly , as if it were a duty that must be accomplished even in the midst of a catastrophe . He was thinking what this would do to him . " I guess that 'll ruin our chances for the Browne and Geddings bid , " he decided . " I 'll bet my bottom dollar they wo n't touch us now . You can just hear the labor men putting the pressure on . " " It 'll close down the damned plant , that 's what it 'll do ! " George flared up . But his fire was short-lived ; he seemed almost resigned . " Oh , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers have printed worse things before . That 's their stock in trade , you know . " There was a long silence . George was eating away steadily . It was as if they had talked it all out , and there was nothing  | more to say . Now and then one of them would make an isolated statement . " Why do n't you make a retraction in the other papers ? " Alan asked . " A disclaimer ? " " I talked with our lawyer . He advises not to say anything . The papers have been trying to get me all morning . " " Urn . " A long pause , then : " They printed the  --  the whole thing ? " " Every damned word . It  --  it looks pretty bad on paper , Al . " His voice sounded almost humble . " Then you ca n't sue . You would n't have a leg to stand on . After all , you did say it , " Alan reminded him gently . " But it is n't fair ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stored up inside began coming out now . " It is n't fair . They have their say , and I guess I ought to have mine ! I have some rights , do n't I ? Or do I , in this Goddamned country , the way it 's run now ? I should just lie down and take it , I suppose ? I 've got a right to fight . Tom has nothing to lose  --  but , good God , I 've got a whole plant ! " It was noticeable how often they came back to Tom . " He fights for a principle , " Alan tried to explain calmly . " And everything , any sort of information , is fair game . You 've got to fight fire with fire . " " But Tom ... " George repeated in an aggrieved tone . Alan would never have believed George would be so perturbed about that side of it . He tried to think what he himself felt about Tom now , in the light of this incident . It might affect him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go through , if for no other reason than this interview might lead the steel workers to walk out on George . Browne and Geddings would n't bother with a company that was tied up with an idle plant . . . . But Alan was n't surprised  | at Tom  --  not nearly so much as George appeared to be . George was sentimental about his friends . This would harden him ; harden him plenty . If Tom had thought to gain an advantage by publishing that stuff , he was wrong . It would only make the conflict more fierce . Right now George was stunned , but there was n't any doubt he 'd fight unionization all the harder . He would be stubborn like that . And he had too many sympathizers among the Little Steel companies . Look at Weir ... . The waiter had taken their dishes away . There were cigarette ashes on the clean cloth , and some spilled sugar . George was absently rolling the grains into a little mound . Alan pushed back his chair . " Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A little squash will do us good . Get it out of our systems . " " No , I do n't feel much like playing , Al .... It gets me , how a fellow could do that to a friend .... " He was back on the same subject . " Look here , let 's go find Tom , " Alan counseled . " Maybe he did n't have anything to do with it . I can hardly believe ? " " He 's the only one who could . No , I never want to see that guy again . " " Well , I 'm going to look him up . Maybe he 's home this afternoon . " It would be more reassuring , at any rate , to talk with Tom . There must be some explanation . Maybe he could persuade Tom to write another article  --  to take the sting out . " You do n't mind if I go ? Pat and I 'll meet you for tonight , just the same ? " " Sure . Come around in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your time , Al . He is n't the man I thought he was . " " I 'm going to find out , " Alan said decisively .  | CHAPTER EIGHTEeN ALAN walked cross-town , shadowed and perplexed by conflicting thoughts concerning this errand . One thing he knew : he was not going merely as an emissary for George , to smooth the whole thing over . He had decided that , all right . What he wanted to know , what was very important for himself was to know the truth , to learn exactly why Tom had done this . As he walked west on Monroe , even the moment he had emerged from the club , he left something behind . Rather , perhaps , he regained an old feeling that he often had alone in the Loop . This was the city  --  any city , but Chicago in particular . The club , the Avenue and people like George were mere fronts . Everything they stood for was but a small , almost insignificant part of what the city meant . It was composed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their neon signs lighted in the gloom ; the liquor stores and haberdasheries ; the people on the street ; the newsboys at every corner , chattering about noon editions , whipping out their papers and tucking them under the arms of hurried men  --  men who fished under their heavy overcoats for change , then dashed for the nearest elevated stair ; men who were badgered by all the cares and damned few of the amenities and , when they got those few , were so happy and grateful it made you wince.  | I belong among them , because I have been among them , Alan thought . I must not forget . It was this , he knew perfectly well , that made him angry at times when his way was balked , and made him all the more ambitious to fight to the top . Why should n't he be restless ? Now this damned bid for Browne and Geddings ; he had n't given up hope , but he knew they no longer had a fair chance . Tom had done this to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the tangle of intersections , streetcars screeched and clanged . Here now the pavement was torn up at the corner ; they were fixing the street , or a sewer or some part of the underground vitals . A lecherous white slime spread out across the uneven bricks and onto the slick car tracks . This , somehow , was it : not very ordered or beautiful or sure . And like any other rabbit in this warren , he had to jump for the curb to avoid being splashed as a yellow taxi swung around the corner . At Clark he boarded a streetcar . He had n't been able to reach Tom by ' phone , so the chances were he would be up at the place he shared with Charley Rosencrantz , the little Jewish painter who had made a name for himself at the time of the fair . The car was crowded and he had to hang onto a strap , the slick worn leather cutting his wrist , his feet wet and cold upon the damp and dirty boards , as they moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight incline to the bridge and clattering across with the hollow sound of the steel trestles beneath . The river looked the color of gangrene , faintly steaming under the unhealthy air that was just above freezing .  | On the other side of the bridge , a couple of streets farther on , they stopped so that he faced an old shop , its streaked window full of every sort of junk from painted plaster Indian heads to Victorian gas-lamp chandeliers and chamber pots . In the midst of all this , crumpled up , lay a Mexican sarape . It was blue with a big black and white diamond pattern , a real Texcoco , the best kind . He had almost decided to get off and find out how much it was , and how it happened to be there , when the car started with a jerk that threw him off balance . Some other time he 'd do it ; he had work to be accomplished . He found a seat as they came to Division and stared out the window at the small stores and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At North Avenue on the edge of Lincoln Park , which looked dreary and bedraggled , forlorn and deserted in this weather , he got off and transferred to a westbound car . Beyond LaSalle the buildings were even more dingy . They rode past other stores , now with Jewish or Italian names over the doors , punctuated occasionally by the bright red front of an Atlantic &; Pacific or the green of a National Tea , with long streamers pasted on the windows , the special prices printed in bold red letters , or written in whitewash right on the glass . At the corner by a funeral parlor and a secondhand furniture store he got off and went through a narrow door that led up dark steps . The air stank like every musty old building . He could n't recall when he had been up here last , but he knew the door , at the end of the corridor . He knocked loudly . A voice inside shouted for him to come in . The room was a great barnlike studio with a north light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been partitioned off with unpainted wallboard to form a bedroom . The only furniture showing was a window seat beneath the north light , a couple of moth-eaten easy chairs , a bookcase and a table , all piled with papers . But what he saw first , even before he recognized Charley Rosencrantz on the stepladder , was an enormous canvas stretched on one wall . A few completed figures shouted from the expanse of putty-colored background . " Well , for God 's sake , look who 's here ! " Charley greeted him . He was wearing a mechanic 's brown jumper that was liberally spotted with pigments . " Do n't come down , Charley  --  h'are you ? I 'm looking for Tom . " " Glad to have a chance to rest . Light 's getting worse , anyway . " Charley came down , rubbing his hand on his pants leg . They shook hands . For no reason , except that they were both Jewish , Alan thought of Sam Eisenberg at college . But only Charley 's mouth and his liquid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for a hell of a time , " he said . " Sit down if you can find a place  --  just shove that stuff on the floor . Tom 'll be along . " " Yes . Thanks , " Alan said . " I do n't get over here much , " he apologized , " because , you know , living out in the sub-urbs ? " " Sure , I know . " Charley had the affableness of the Jew . As if , Alan always thought , he wanted to ward off just such apologies ; as if he were saying he understood that he was a Jew , and that was the reason , but he did n't want you to tell him , please , because it was humiliating . " What 's that you 're doing there ? " Alan asked . He began to feel at ease ; he should come over more often .  | " Oh , I 'm painting it on a WPA project . Sometimes I have my doubts , though , whether the orphans will like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Alan felt uncomfortable again ; this fellow who had so much promise , and now on relief . He felt like an outsider , an interloper . Had he lost touch ? Only three or four years ago . . . . Was this gone , this part of his life , too ? " I like it ? very much , " he said . He went over to inspect the mural . Charley switched on the electric lights , three bare bulbs hanging down from the ceiling . The reds and blues immediately leaped forth . " I 've never had the chance to carry out a mural before , " Charley said . His voice was full of enthusiasm . " It 's a real thing the government 's doing , you know that , Alan ? " Alan was thinking how George would snort over the government 's spending money for painting . " You do n't mind , then ? " he had to ask . " Mind ? Jesus , it 's right , Alan ! I was going soft in the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around for portrait commissions . I 'd got that low . . . . Then I came to  --  Tom persuaded me ? " " I came over to see him about something like that . Have you heard about the interview he wrote ? " " About that guy Anderson ? Yeah , he mentioned it when he came in last night . " Alan 's heart sank . " Then he did write it ? You see , George Anderson is a friend of his , Charley . The three of us went to college together . " " Well , can you beat that ? " Charley was merely polite . " But ? " Alan began . And then he wondered what there really was to say . " Tom could have been writing novels ?  | good ones , I mean  --  instead of that sort of crap , " he finished angrily . Charley nodded , rubbing his chin . " But then , he would have written some pretty bald truths . They would have been just as hard to take . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , staying with what he believes in . " Charley walked back to the window seat and sat down . " I do n't think he could have done anything else . The way I figure it , Alan , you 're just cut out to do something . A guy has to do what he has to do . I 'm primarily a painter , but he 's a Leftist . You ca n't blame him for that . " " Nor George , either , " Alan said thoughtfully . " Only ? Tom went out of his way . You know what I mean . " He joined Charley on the window seat . That winter after the crash  --  had he , himself , gone out of his way ? " I suppose it 's a matter of integrity , " he answered himself , thinking of both George 's and Tom 's viewpoints . " All this business of dividing the country up into Right and Left  --  it 's too simple for me , it 's not the way I look at it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now you 're talking , " Charley agreed . " Take those two figures . " He pointed a long finger at a lean , black-haired man and a cheap blonde girl on his canvas . " I call them the bitch and the bastard . Maybe you 've heard of Emily ? " Alan shook his head , grinning . " She 's a sort of fixture . Not a regular whore , but worse ? she sleeps around with a lot of the boys . A dame who has delusions of grandeur . One time I wanted to paint her in the nude . Think she 'd do it ? Finally she said she would . But she kept her shoes and hat on . That satisfied her . ' S fact . " They both laughed . " But what does it prove ? " Alan asked .  | " Mmm , you got me . Then the bastard . He 's a Russian . Came in here and modeled . I paid him two bucks an afternoon , which is pretty fair pay . Perfect example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a criminal type . Then day before yesterday he took only a dollar , and walked out on me . " Maybe it 's what people think they are , and what they should do ? " Alan asked . Charley scratched his head . " I 've been trying to work out some theory that would fit , " he acknowledged . " All I know is , these two wo n't join the models ' union they 're trying to enforce . " " Y'know , Charley , every once in a while a fellow sort of stops and wonders . Whether he 's getting anyplace and if he 's on the right track . " " You ? Why , I thought you were all set , Al . Every once in a while I hear something about your Steel Houses . And only the other night , Tom was saying ? " " He always did think I 'd sold out . We never saw eye to eye . " " Not many do . No , he just said something about you were lucky . Said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and got it . ' Everything a man could reasonably ask for , ' he said . That 's no bull  --  I do n't mean that you  --  hell , " Charley floundered , embarrassed . " It 's the same with me . Tom thinks all I have to do now is paint along . No problems at all , because I 've laid out my cartoons for that mural . " " I know what you mean , " Alan nodded . He was grateful to Charley . He happened to know just how kindhearted he was . Probably half the time he was helping Tom out by staking him to meals or rent . There was a rap at the door and they both started up , think-  | ing it was Tom . Instead a chunky , gray-haired man came in . Alan was sure the newcomer was a newspaperman even before Charley introduced them , because he did n't take his hat off . He gave Alan an abrupt handshake . His name was Shannon . " Looking for White , " he explained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Alan guessed . " Yeah . You know ? Say , you 're not ? ? " " I just happened to be with Tom and George Anderson that night . I 'm with Steel Houses . " " Oh-ho . " Shannon showed interest . " Maybe you know the real dope ? We thought it was just a good yarn to warm up the boys to SWOC out at the steel plant . You mean to say Anderson honest-to-God said all that crap ? " " Not as an interview . But I 'm afraid he did . " Shannon sat down suddenly . " Be God damned . I thought he was smarter than that . " " Have a good trip ? " Charley asked him . " Shannon 's been out on a special assignment , " he explained to Alan . " Boy , you could n't call it good when I got back to southern Ohio . Jesus , boy , they 're having the deluge , and that 's the straight goods . " " Were you covering the flood ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio . " It had been harrowing , those calls for help . He and Pat had listened in , unwilling to leave and yet hating the tragedy  --  no doubt the way everybody had felt . " We sent some clothes , " he said . " To the Red Cross . " " They need money more . When you stop at the cigar counter in a hotel around there , they just take all the change and put it in the box . Ask you afterward .... " But he said that was merely an extra job for him when he happened on  | that area . He had been all over the country , writing special articles about business conditions . There was talk of a boom . " Recovery 's a fact , " Charley stated loyally . " But I guess your Republican paper wo n't let you print it , will they ? " Shannon twisted his mouth up . " All I know is , I 'm supposed to tell what Franklin D. Roosevelt is doing to stop the parade . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Say , Charley , what say ? ? let 's have a drink . I got a hell of a cold coming on . Those one-night stands ? " " I used to travel a lot myself , " Alan said , suddenly eager . He was envious of this Shannon . All the small towns , across the country . Instead of sitting here , in one spot . And stymied , at that . " I guess you know what the hell it is , then , " Shannon said with disgust . " Hotels ? " " I do n't know , I kind of liked it .... What 's the real dope about conditions ? " Charley came out with three thick tumblers partly full of tap water , and a pint of bourbon . The whisky was raw and young and lukewarm without ice . But it helped . " In general , " Shannon said carefully , " big business seems to have a real chance for a comeback . Of course this Supreme Court hoorah now . . . What d' you think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winking at Alan . " Or maybe you do n't think it 's a threat to the Constitution ? " " The hell with you , " Charley retorted , unwilling to be baited . " One sure sign of better times is all these strikes . Every businessman knows that , but he wo n't admit it . And you know , a strange thing , I think the west coast is better off than we are , or the East . "  | " The west coast ? " Alan repeated . " Yeah , doing a lot of building , too . And that 's a real sign , believe you me , when you get construction going . " " That 's up Alan 's alley , " Charley put in . " Well , Reed , if you 're doing any work out that way , you 're in for dividends . You probably know that yourself . " " No , I did n't . We have n't any work out there . " This was interesting . He wanted to hear more . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They all pounced on him , asking questions . He shrugged them off while he helped himself to the whisky . Then he turned on Alan . " So George sent you around , eh ? " he asked sharply . " He did not . But when he told me ? " " Surprised him , I 'll bet ? " Tom was smiling in a queer way . He took a good long drink . " Or maybe he thought that was like me ? " Alan remembered that there had been things he had wanted to find out , questions he wanted to be answered . He had n't anticipated that Tom might be antagonistic to him . " Now , get this straight , White . George did n't send me . I did n't even come because that article may play hell with the plant  --  and play hell with our getting any business , either . I could have , but I did n't .... " " Offering condolences maybe ? " Alan looked him in the eye . " I just want one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring straight back . " Tell George I wrote it ? what the hell ? But for your private edification  --  you 'll be surprised to know the first time I saw the story it was in type . Groves , that 's the editor , showed it to me. "  | CHAPTER NINETEEN " I DO N'T believe him , " George said doggedly for the third or fourth time . Now they were sitting in his living room again . Alan held out his cup for Lydia to give him more coffee . They had been through about everything at dinner . It was pretty apparent that Lydia had talked hard to George since this noon . Alan absolutely hated Lydia this evening . From the first time he had met her he had felt that there was something unreal about George 's wife  --  almost inhuman . Tonight , for instance , when little George Junior had come in while they were having cocktails . You could see the kid worshiped his mother , and she had hardly let him kiss her . She made Alan think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so very cold and aloof ; as a child he had hated that character and had been repulsed by her . Now he recognized his feelings , pinned them down . Lydia was too beautiful in a  --  he was going to say , in a Hollywood way . But that was n't quite it . True , she was statuesque ; and her long , severe ash-blonde hair contrasted with a vivid lipstick and her eyes , the blue of cold winter . Pat always said he did n't like her because Lydia wore such bright colors with that natural paleness . But to him it seemed almost cheap . Not quite : her very coldness saved her . If she was n't so  | damned well bred that beauty would have got her into trouble . Yet it never would . With a kind of savage relish he tried to picture what would happen if she ever found herself in a situation of which she was n't master . " I do n't see how you can say that , George ! " Pat was saying . " Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " She had been surprisingly sympathetic and understanding . But George had changed since luncheon time . " He certainly wo n't ever come into my house , " Lydia put in . " I told George , he ought to be arrested . " " Now , Lydia ? " " I do n't care ! I do n't see why you stick up for him , darling , " she turned on Pat . " You 're the one who wo n't get to go away just because ? " " Oh , that does n't matter , Lyd . Personally , do you know who I think did it ? " " Who ? " George asked , as if he were catching at a straw . Then he shook his head . " No , he 's the only possible one , it just stands to reason . " " Did n't he walk out of the party right afterward ? " Lydia reminded her . Alan set down his empty cup and moved over to the fireplace where George was sitting , hunched up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; George seemed out of place .... " There 's no use speculating on the source , " he tried to say casually . He had n't thought Pat had noticed , that night of the dinner . Pat went right on : " I think it was Wilson Brent . He 's the one , I feel sure . Did n't he want to get even with you , George ? " " Oh , nonsense ! " Lydia scoffed . " I do n't see why you stand  | up for Tom White , when you know perfectly well he 's a Communist ? " " My God , Lydia , you read too many newspapers ! " Alan snorted . George had caught up the idea . " Well , I would n't put it past that guy Brent . " " You 'll only make matters worse , " Alan soothed him quickly . He had been thinking it could have been Brent ; but there was no use stirring up more trouble . " You do n't know , however . You could never prove it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and I 'm satisfied he does n't . " " I do n't believe one word of it . He would n't stop at anything , " Lydia announced . That was just a little more than Alan would take from her . " I told you what was said this afternoon . There was n't anything more . " The bitch , he thought , the blonde bitch . " You 're doubting Alan 's word , too , " George reproved her . She was plainly making him uncomfortable . Through this talk Alan could see a fragment of the argument that must have taken place this afternoon . " Well , I did n't mean that , " Lydia backed down . She gave Alan the kind of smile a queen would confer upon a subject . Then she turned on her husband , who was fair game : " If you 're going to let a wild guess keep you from believing ? " " Of course , even so , he could have killed the story , could n't he , Alan ? " George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have said ? " " Said what ? " Alan asked back . He did n't give a damn now . " We 're hearing a lot about truth tonight . He 'd have to say it was true , would n't he ? You said every word , remember . "  | " But , a friend . . . " George said those words differently now . He sounded tough ; just the way he would question his employees ' loyalty if they tried to form a union in his plant . " Perhaps we 'd better start , " Pat suggested . " Lydia , that 's the sweetest dress . " Alan looked at George and they smiled at their wives ' transition . " Come on , " George offered amicably , " let 's have a highball before we go , and forget this thing . " " Yes , let 's make it a party ! " Pat urged them . But it was a very conscious effort on all their parts to make amends , Alan thought . The air was still tense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not giving an inch , merely ceasing to talk . Too much had been said already . Strangely enough , he no longer cared . It did n't rankle , he was n't even provoked with Lydia by the time George had brought out the Scotch . By these events , he was liberated ; his obligations ceased . They were all a little high when they arrived at the stadium . Pat was excited and gripped his arm tightly . There was more to the gesture than mere excitement : as if for an instant they were alone and she was saying that she believed and that it did n't matter , between the two of them . As soon as they entered the brilliantly lighted stadium they could hear the crowd roaring and the organ playing and the quick , insistent notes of the bell to denote the start of a sprint . Up near the gray steel rafters the floodlights shone down through a haze of blue smoke , and even before they could see , they heard that undercurrent of sound , the slick hiss of bicycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high gallery where there were more seats and they could look down on the  | spectacle . Pat had already picked out her team and was searching for them . A roar went up from the crowd , and they could see the little riders , far below , hunched over the handlebars in their bright red and blue and green jerseys against the great yellow oval of wooden track . Along the edge of the pit were the riders ' green booths , and the concession stands and the black mass of people at the center , in the bullpen . They were racing now ; Pat was on her feet again , jumping up and down , cheering for her Red Devils . Alan was racing right with them , edging forward out of the jam , pedaling , pedaling for dear life . Do n't let that other fellow ride you to the outside on these sloping curves  --  come on , you bastard ! Now his partner was ready , his feet strapped to the pedals , the light shining from those silver spokes ... . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddle of hard leather under his buttocks , the strength in his calves , looking back to see his partner coming up ; then nodding to his trainer and feeling himself being pushed up onto that slickly , hollowly sounding track , taking the place of his used teammate , making up for lost ground , thinking of the special purse that had been offered , driving harder and harder , hearing only the whir of his own chain and the roar of the crowd because he was out in front now . Harder , harder , do n't let them catch up  --  drive , man , put your guts into it . Make all the rest of the boys sore at you for starting the pace . To hell with what they thought or would say on the train going to Toronto next week . Feeling the sweat standing out on his face and stinging , and the sweep of wind in front of him , like swimming through cold , sharp water . . . . The little bell rang again , the organ pealed forth loudly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he settled back in his seat as the riders began to slow up , riding quietly now , relaxed , merely keeping up with one another as they had been doing for six days and nights , waiting for the next sprint which would come after nine more laps . Pat was talking to Lydia and George was beyond them , lighting a cigarette and looking over the program . George could not draw him into the battle any further , Alan was deciding . Steel Houses was important , and Alan Reed ; you were lost if you hung onto someone else 's coattails , and by God , that was n't going to happen to him . All right , face the facts : where was he getting , anyway ? Ed Haywood was no help ; Alan had given up talking over problems with him . But the company would need a new field of endeavor , if steel strikes were going to clog up the source of supply . Even if the percentage of steel they actually used was small , it was the skeleton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tied up . . . They must find another material , another field , another place . Who said he had to stay here in Chicago ? You would n't pass up a chance just to stay with a handful of friends ; now , would you ? Not of course that he ever had , but Pat . . . Still , after the way Lydia talked tonight , she certainly could n't feel quite the same . Drive hard , ride out of the jam . That was the answer . Just as true now as it had been always . No one was going to help you pedal your bicycle , and you would n't want him to . He 'd come a long ways ; it was a mistake to think he 'd been wasting his time here . But now getting stymied , in a jam . Down in Brazil , he had the right answer . He was green then , of course , but the main chance was quite as important today . Father had n't taken it , and look where he still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd always wanted to drive ahead all the harder ... . " Let 's go down in the bullpen , " Pat said . They walked down all the stairs single file and through the underpass and out into the pit at the center . Now they were surrounded by the track which rose above them . The crowd was thick and they lost George and Lydia . The bell began to ring insistently again and the crowd answered . From here you could see how fast they were going , right past youwhiz  --  mere blobs of color , and they were gone , then around the inward-sloping curve , nearly horizontal so that it looked as if they would fall into the pen every time . Pat was jumping up and down . Suddenly the crowd cried out with one voice , and she was fighting her way to the rim . Alan pushed after her but people came between ; there had been a spill , he had glimpsed the man tumbling down , his bike with him , miraculously escaping the other flashing wheels . A gong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officials had extricated the fallen man and looked him over . Pat was near the edge ; he could n't get to her so he stood there where she would see him above the heads of the others , when she turned around . He was trying to recall something he had heard this afternoon . Something which , as he had come down the stairs a moment ago , had flashed through his mind ; something important . Now he was getting it . What Shannon had said  --  a business boom . The west coast leading the country out of the depression . Housing construction . . . . That was it ! Build them out there . Not from steel but from the materials at hand . What did they use out west ? Timber , adobe , tile ?  | There ought to be some way to standardize . . . . He 'd ask Ed if he knew . No . He 'd do it himself . Tomorrow he 'd start writing letters and asking for information . Write the big construction companies and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at something new . Build up a real prospect before he told Ed  --  much less the directors . That was it ! Expansion . Why , Steel Houses had n't touched the surface , it was young . Something to put his teeth into . He 'd work at this every spare minute  --  not hurry it , but map out the whole plan , think out every detail in advance . Then they 'd let him go out there to build up the business . California : he and Pat could live there ! Warm days , mountains again with purple shadows on them , the sea  --  this beat a puny cruise six days and Sunday ! The West Coast Branch of Steel Houses , Incorporated : Alan Reed , manager . Manager . Without Ed to cope with , just have him send out specifications when they were needed . And no directors , no cautious , conservative , pessimistic Georges . And one of these days , when the directors would see what was accomplished , what he could do when they gave him a free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this company . Ed would n't mind , he 'd prefer being architect and nothing more . Alan Reed , President of Steel Houses , Incorporated ... . " Oh , there you are ! " Pat was tugging at his sleeve . " I thought I 'd lost you . . . . What 's the matter ? " she asked . His face must have shown how intent he 'd been . Start tomorrow .... " Nothing , dear , nothing , " he assured her . It would be a wrench for her , moving away . But she 'd like it , once she was out there . Bound to .  | " You are n't worried about  --  about Tom and all that ? " she insisted apprehensively , her eyes searching his face . He wanted to bend down and kiss her , right here in this crowd . " No , I 'm not . Not in the least . Not even thinking of it , " he said blithely . " Because I do n't want you to  --  sure you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Nothing was further from my thoughts , " he answered . " Let 's forget it . " In time he 'd tell her . But not now .  | CHAPTER TWENTY ALAN leafed through the huge folder of letters once more to be sure they were all there : almost every one came from someplace in California , with a smattering of other states here and there . They were in order of their receipt , the ones on the very bottom dated early in February , and ranging through the last five months  --  through the gray days , the blustery days , the days of false spring and of tentative warmth , the rainy days , and the hot day that was yesterday . Now , late in June , the file was at last complete enough to spring on Ed . He rose from his desk , patting the folder with affection and a little smile of satisfaction , and strode across to his open window . From the river below came a great blast from an ore boat , followed by the shrill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busily nosing the ponderous stubborn ship as it stirred the greenish-gray water into yellow mud . The bridge was going up , cars were collecting in lines on either bank of the river , their hoods and radiators and headlights shining in the warm sun . There was the incessant little tink-tink-tink of the warning bells to denote the bridge was up . At last the freighter was through , the ship 's funnel suddenly emitted a white plume of steam ; the mighty crescendo of its whistle , echoing against the buildings , sounded like the loud yawn of a lazy giant . Cars began starting up before the bridge lowered its flat lips  | together again . Over on State Street , penetrating all these greater sounds , the streetcars clanked and rattled as they ascended the slight incline to the bridge , across which their wheels rumbled hollowly . The sound was almost immediately obliterated by the cars whining into gear , impatiently hooting and squawking with their horns . God , how he 'd like to be on that ship , even just for a trip up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were taking the inland waterway clear to the ocean  --  frequently he had seen some foreign flag on the aft mast . Did n't seem quite sensible , here in this mid-continental city . He was impatient to be on his way  --  anywhere . The only reason he 'd consented to go out with Ed to see the new house they were building in Barrington was that he wanted this chance to explain his plan . Late June , he thought again , and almost the first decent weather they 'd had . It had been rainy all month and nearly every morning he had left for the office with his raincoat over his arm . The cool weather rebuffed the city until it seemed summer would never come , yet when he wore his raincoat he felt hot and sticky and unpleasant by the time he 'd walked along Wacker Drive from the station . It had n't been any fun playing golf , with soggy greens underfoot and the sky misty and like as not a chill breeze down the fairway . When Pat would drive out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fluffy pale blue coat with a bright neckerchief tied about her head . She would be twirling her sunglasses in her hand  --  those white-rimmed ones everyone was buying this summer  --  but seldom putting them on , because there was still so little glare . They were simply waiting for summer to burst upon them . Only the flowers in the garden gave  | any sign . The house was full of iris ; the jonquils and tulips were gone . A hell of a climate . Out there on the west coast .. . But even the East was far better than this . At least there you had real spring . Why , he remembered at college that by the middle of April the forsythia was out , covering the gray walls of the dormitories with their yellow blossoms , and he and George would take bikes and go out to Stony Brook and lie in the sun ; by early May it was hot down at Princeton ... . George had gone to their tenth reunion last week ; Alan had n't seen him since . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding out against the C. I. O .... But those days , when they used to bathe in the muddy little stream , then run around naked , or lie in the thick grass talking about what would be ... . Curious , how bits of the past had crept into this Chicago life  --  Tom and George , and now Stevenson from Columbus . Although he purposely had sent for Steve because they needed a good accountant . The surprise was that Steve had brought a wife , and that she should be Mary Buchanan . Out of the past , these four diverse people  --  and why : did they signify something , or was it all pure chance ? Just then Ed opened the door . That funny three-year-old Panama hat of his flapped on the top of his head . He was ready to go at last . Alan snatched up his folder , shoving it in a brief case and fastening it as he went out . " I think you 'll be interested in this house , " Ed said as they shot down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He felt a little grim about that . " May be the last one we 'll put up for some time . Our inventory 's plenty low and until this strike situation ? "  | " Yes , " Ed said vaguely . He was n't perturbed . On the street it was considerably hotter than it had been when Alan had walked over this morning . Summer , all right : time to think about getting out the electric fans . Young men were walking along with their coats over their arms , their bright suspenders showing ; women were wearing light dresses  --  and little underneath them : their fannies wobbled plainly beneath silk and cotton . Some of them wore no stockings ; their still-white legs with their red heels , showing the , calluses and chaps of winter , looked singularly unattractive , moving up and down out of their shiny , cheap patent-leather pumps . Fat men were mopping their brows and thin ones seemed to be expanding , coming out of their cocoons . Why did summer remind him of Lawsonville , with women sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the lawnmowers whirring and the smell of new-cut grass and the big flat fan blades that swung lazily in the cool gloom of Prester 's drugstore , with its wire chairs and its smell of chocolate sodas ? Probably because he had enjoyed the summers so much as a kid . Because that season spelled action and laughed at the dreary indoor months of reflection and talk . Action . " I 've got a ? " he began to tell Ed , but they were at the parking place now . With Ed driving they turned west on Lake Street . Beneath the L tracks there was no use trying to talk . On the other side of the river they slanted out long , noisy Milwaukee Avenue . " Flown up north yet ? " Alan asked Ed , trying to be casual . All through the summer Ed would fly up to a cabin he owned in northern Wisconsin and spend the week ends  --  absolutely alone , as far as anyone ever knew .  | " As a matter of fact , Al , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They offered me such a good trade-in , and this new one has a whale of an instrument panel ? " Alan listened patiently . There was no hurry about pressing his point . They drove on through peripheral shopping centers and past taverns and restaurants with Polish names . Dumpylooking women with black net market bags waited on the curb for streetcars . For some reason he liked all this . Even here he could see unmistakable signs of summer . As he had noted from the train the other evening on his way home . The windows of the coach were open for the first time and familiar smells had come to him : familiar and yet forgotten since last fall , before they were frozen in for the winter . First came that odor like a galvanized wash tub  --  that was the river itself ; then the peculiar smell of fermentation from pickle or preserve factories . And in rapid succession , as the train pulled out and began going faster , the pungent smell of tar as they passed a paving manufacturing plant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and something smoky , like molasses spilling over on the stove or cereal that has been done to a crisp in the oven ; and then the sawdust in the air , reminiscent of freshly hewn lumber , followed by the damp odor of rags and paper from a box and carton plant . Things like that ... . " It 's really a beauty , " Ed said abruptly , and Alan had to shift his focus before he guessed this was more discussion about the new plane . " I took her up north for a trial spin ? just stopped and looked into the cabin . The field was still pretty muddy . Took me only an hour and forty minutes . " " I 'll be damned ! " Alan exclaimed with proper appreciation . " Flying 's a great thing , " he added tritely , but Ed solemnly  | nodded agreement . Funny how little you really knew about what went on inside other people 's heads . They were getting near the country at last ; presently they would be on the Northwest Highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and roofs with green asbestos shingles , one like the next , had now taken the place of stores . Stevenson lived out here somewhere . " Ever flown out to the west coast ? " Alan asked , again very casually . Ed shook his head . " I 'd like to make the trip . My old ship was n't equipped for long cross-country flights  --  I never took the chance . It would be a beautiful sight , those mountains ? " " It 's magnificent , " Alan assured him . " I flew east from Los Angeles one time . You ca n't imagine . . . What made me think of it , I 've an idea , Ed . " " You do n't mean selling them out there ? " Ed was immediately skeptical . " They 're already sold  --  practically . I brought along a folder of letters I 'd like you to look at . There 's a marvelous opportunity in California . " " But we 've never figured costs for west of the Rockies , " Ed objected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as I do we could n't expect them to pay the freight . I think you could make a survey if you flew out there one of these days . " " I do n't see what I ? " They had come upon the Northwest Highway now and were going faster by endless filling stations , through little towns , following the Chicago &; Northwestern Railway tracks . " What I mean is , " Alan went on , " out there they use different materials for housing construction . You could see what 's  | at hand , what could be done cheaply in big lots . Get an idea of their problems . " Alan felt he was warming up now . " See what they need and what they want . " " Pseudo-Spanish , " Ed sniffed . " Do n't be too sure . I 've seen modern houses there that would knock your eyes out . " " Wait till you see ours in Barrington . " " They do n't need big furnaces and cellars , for one thing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heating . That sort of thing helps cut the costs . Air conditioning , yes . Plenty of fenestration ? " " But we could n't handle a business from here , Al . " Alan lighted a cigarette . " No , we could n't , " he said steadily . " But with a real proposition to offer them , we could afford to establish a branch . Do you know what I want to do ? " " Yes , I know what you want to do , Al . You want to go out there . " His voice was almost sad . " That 's it exactly . " Ed was n't anybody 's fool , after all . " We could n't do without you here . What would we ? " " Thanks for the kind words , but  --  you could . Until I got things started in the West Coast Branch , at least . . . . Ed , if we get into this business in a big way , we 're made ! " " I think we 've come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke with finality . They came to the white sign that said Barrington now , and drove on through the town and up the sloping street that led out into the country again . The little hills were beautiful . From the top of them they could see gently rolling country all about . The landscape looked more like New Jersey or anywhere but the edge  | of the prairie . Ed pointed his long finger toward a distant knoll . " There it is , " he said , and they turned in on a dirt road that wound through meadows , bordered on one side by a white rail fence : the sort that always denotes the new landed gentry of America who like riding to hounds . As they drew up in front of the house they could see the workmen moving about and a short , fat-faced man standing in front , directing the work  --  MacMahan , the contractor . He greeted Ed with a dubious nod . Plainly he was n't quite sold on this kind of contraption . Only the framework was complete , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be even more pronounced when the long , low sides became smooth white walls . There was a terrace at the back , overlooking the countryside . In the distance were patches of farms , a winding river shadowed by willows and the town , a cluster far away . Alan stood on the rough floor boards thinking of the spring when he and Pat had seen their own house grow from such a skeleton . But that was n't enough for him , any longer . " Beautiful , " he remarked to Ed . " Beautiful , but too aristocratic for us . Mass production is what we need , not one luxurious house for a rich guy . " Ed seemed to be paying no attention . He had stooped down and was sighting along the skeleton of steel  --  thin lathlike ribbons , hardly seeming strong enough for the weight  --  upon which the walls , everything would hang . " I 'll tell you how I feel , Al , " he said without looking up . He had taken off his glasses ; around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him look older . " I 've always thought we ought to become firmly established here in Chicago . Probably it  | was just as well that we never did get that Browne and Geddings bid in Philadelphia . " Alan kicked a piece of wood across the floor . He was n't receiving rational arguments now , he was having to combat this old feeling that Chicago was the hub of the universe . These deep roots ... . " Chicago put up the first steel skyscraper in the whole country , " Ed reminded him , as if to clinch the matter . Alan retorted quickly , " Yeah , but they never appreciated Wright  --  besides , that was yesterday . Your idea has always been to use every new material and principle that comes along . And actually , Californians are more susceptible to new things than we are here . I know ! They have n't the tradition  --  the bad tradition . " " Well , it 's a question . " " I 've got to have something big to work on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remember we 've got the directors to consider . " They were in the way of a workman so they walked out onto the terrace . " Maybe I 'm too much of a salesman , " Alan pretended to depreciate himself . " Maybe you have a better idea . All I can say is , we have to keep moving or get lost in the shuffle . But as I say , I may be in the wrong pew . " Now he had him . Ed began protesting : what would they do without Alan ? True enough , Steel Houses must advance . He did n't want Alan to get the idea that he favored no sort of expansion . " That 's all I ask you to say right now , " Alan consoled him . " You 're the one to think it over and decide . Then you might fly out there and look the situation over . "  | The contractor came up then , pointing out all the reasons why the work was n't going any faster . Presently Ed was satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost into town Ed conceded : " Maybe it would be a good idea if I looked over those letters . Do they give you any dope about materials ? " " Oh , yes . But do n't bother if you 're busy ? " " No , no . I 'll take them home tonight , if you do n't mind . " " Well , that 's fine Ed . " Ed was trying to say something else . The idea had begun to appeal to his imagination . " I think , " he ventured as he cut into the curb between two parked cars , " we might be able to do something with it , after all . . Does this place look all right to eat ? " Alan nodded and got out of the car . " After all , " Ed repeated solemnly , " this is the time to get into the field . We ca n't stand still . " " By golly , I think you have the right analysis , " Alan agreed . He let Ed go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to shake , and a wide grin spread across his face . Jesus , oh Jesus , he chortled to himself . I 'll sell them all , directors and all , before I get through . Sell them the idea ... .  | CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE PAT hummed as she carried the picnic things from the icebox to the hamper . She felt particularly happy this afternoon . On some days you just felt good without knowing why . Partly , it might be , because she liked doing things herself in the kitchen without Gunhild here to boss her or look disapproving or offended . But chiefly it must be because for a change Alan was home on a Saturday . He was in good spirits himself : she could hear him stomping around upstairs , whistling , calling her to find out where his old sneakers were and those ancient gray flannels , his loves which she 'd nearly given away . Lately he had been so very preoccupied , more so than usual . Probably now he was responding to this splendid week of hot weather  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discouraging month . For the first time she could remember Alan had complained about the bills . Even though she had tried to be so careful . He was coming downstairs now , running . " Darling , " she sang out , " will you be a lamb and bring the napkins from the dining room ? " Alan laid them down on the porcelain table . Now he must tell her , here , even while she was busy with this , thinking only of the picnic . His eyes traveled around the kitchen : it was so clean , so neat and orderly almost as if it had never been used , just as when they moved in . And unreasonably  | he felt a stranger to it . This house , he thought . It 's never quite been ours ; I must have felt that all along . . . . But he must tell Pat now . If only he had n't asked Ed to come along today .. . " Hand me those jars , dearest . " He cleared his throat , wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of the mountains and the Pacific . " Got something to tell you , " he began . Pat went on packing up the hamper . " Before Ed comes , " he said . " He 'll be sure to say something and now you ought to know . . . You see , we 've been working on a new idea . I 've had to  --  simply had to . The time 's come when  --  well , I have n't said anything , but we 're in a pickle . " Pat caught her breath . It had been too good to last , she should have known something was imminent . She was ashamed that her first involuntary thought was about the picnic : now it would be spoiled . " I know , " she said . " The strike at George 's plant . " " That 's only partly it . It goes deeper than that  --  and back farther . You see ? " She looked up at him , really frightened now . " Tell me , tell me quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's a wonderful chance . You see , this idea of mine is to expand a bit . And I thought that out in California . . . " Once the word was said it was suddenly easier and he began telling her , rapidly , all the thoughts he had mulled over in his own mind , that he had told Ed , that Ed had been working on himself for the past week . Pat was suddenly kissing him , overjoyed with relief . " You  | are clever , my husband ! " she exalted . " Who else would think ? ? " " You like the idea ? " he asked , surprised . " It 's wonderful ! But , " she added sorrowfully , " you 'll be commuting ' way out there . Or maybe you 'll have to stay there for weeks and weeks . I do n't like being a widow . " Alan turned away and was busy lighting a cigarette . " That 's the point , " he said quickly to get it over with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be together out there . I 'm not going to leave you behind ? " " Oh ! " she said with a little gasp , faintly . He waited for her to say something more , but she did n't . What was she thinking ? ? Finally it came , but not what he expected : " You 've been considering this  --  a long time , Alan ? You 've thought it over carefully ? " " Carefully ? " He was assured and confident again ; he could deal with this objection . " Why , I 've been over the ground  --  you ought to see the stack of letters and reports I handed Ed ! Ever since February .... " " February ? And you have n't told me till now , Alan ? " Something went tight inside her . Since last winter , she thought . All that time . And that 's what he 's been so preoccupied about . Suddenly she was desperately afraid and miserable . He saw that and began talking rapidly . " I did n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things have gone from bad to worse . Not any one thing  --  maybe I 've just begun to realize . Ed is n't the easiest person in the world to work with . Then there 's the strike . And we did n't get that big contract ? "  | " But , " she cried out now , unable to contain it any longer , " is n't Chicago big enough ? Do you have to go ? " " Not big enough with my job . I 'm not the president , Ed ties my hands without meaning to . I 'm  --  I 'll stagnate here . On the west coast , I 've got a new chance to show them . Chance to gain control . . . . How far would your father have gone if he 'd been under somebody else ? I ca n't make a real pile ? " " But we 're not poor ! Just think how far you 've come in four little years , " she begged him . " That 's almost exactly what Ed said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you see , my love ? Because it 's for you . You have n't had a vacation  --  and it looks like you wo n't get one this summer ? " " Why do I need one ? If I really felt tired of my husband and my house I could visit mother in Maine , could n't I ? You 're the one who needs it . And we could go . Mother would be tickled to death , you know she would . " " No . I want  --  Pat , I want to be able to do everything for you . It 's all right to say we do n't need vacations now , but .. . When we started , you know what I said . I solemnly swore I 'd never forget my ambitions . Because of you . " " Me ? " " Certainly . Do you remember last winter when they were all going on that cruise and we thought we might go along ? And then you had to say I was too busy . That hurt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt my pride and it hurt inside because you could n't have what they did . That 's the kind of feeling Tom calls bourgeois  --  I know that . But , by God , being able to do things for a wife keeps a ma 's self-respect ! What else am I good for ? "  | Pat could not stop laughing . " Oh , Alan , my dear little boy , you 're so  --  so funny ! What are you good for ? You 're my lover , are n't you ? What else do I ? ? " Outside a car began honking insistently . It was Ed coming for them , and they were brought back to the present . Resolutely Pat wiped away all the little fears and tremors . " Let 's have a good time tonight , darling , " she pleaded . Alan picked up the hamper . " All right . . . . But you understand do n't you ? The way I feel ? " " Of course I do , " she soothed him . She understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him again . He needed a change , a vacation . They were putting everything onto his shoulders , at the office ... .  | CHAPTER TWENT Y-TWO THE other cars were already there by the time they found the beach beyond Waukegan . Ed parked carefully on a patch of rank dune grass so that they could easily get out  --  the sand was very soft . Alan took the heavy hamper and plowed through the thick sand . Pat and Ed had run ahead with lesser things to herald his approach . There they all were , Alan saw as he topped the ridge and looked down on the great stretch of white sand that ran along the water 's edge . The same old crowd , as usual . As he was sighted , Lloyd sent something spinning at him through the air , and a giant firecracker exploded at his feet . Alan waved at them all . The same old crowd , but they looked different in their odds and ends of clothes . Only Lydia was nattily clad  --  she would be , he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair held in place with one of those white halos everybody was wearing this summer . It was the first picnic of the year , and everyone felt good because tomorrow was not only the Fourth of July but Sunday , and so Monday would be a legal holiday . A fire was already started and one of the girls was unpacking bowls and jars . He could see there were potato salad and red , uncooked wienies in the speckled brown butcher 's paper , and a large cake in a cardboard box with the top that comes  | down like long ear flaps . Alan went over to Frank MacGregor who was fishing ice out of a thermos bottle and putting it in the cocktails . " That 's what I want , " he announced . George came puffing up with a great piece of driftwood . " Oh , no , you do n't ! " he protested . " Bring in your quota of wood first . " He was wearing an old pair of high-water duck trousers with iron stains on them and sneakers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the soles . Beside Lloyd 's flapping , tailored shorts , he looked disreputable but efficient . He had probably organized everything and seen that the fire was lighted  --  trust George . Pat was unpacking the hamper with Ed to help her , so Alan went up the beach to find more firewood . The lake was calm and iridescent , and he walked down near where the waves gently licked the sand , following someone else 's footprints . In a few moments their voices were faint behind him . He would not have noticed if the talk had reached him now , for on this early , incandescent evening he felt suddenly strong . And he had walked away from them without effort , without being conscious , until now he stopped to think of it , that he really had left . As if by way of illustration he threw back his shoulders , feeling the round knobs of flesh moving easily in his comfortable old clothes ; he experienced his whole body through those clothes as if he were standing naked , about to plunge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he had lived this instant many times before , but then he immediately shook his head . That was a sensation familiar to everyone now and again , yet too close to what had been himself and his tortured desires last spring  --  yes , even last winter .  | Now it was not quite that . He stopped because he wanted to get this very straight in his mind . Some months ago , he would have visualized himself upon another beach . Palm trees or perhaps mountains , insubstantial purple cut-outs against the yellow light , would have sprung up . Salt air would have tickled his nostrils as surely as if he had been upon the mighty edge of the ocean . Wishing for that , with a pain that made him want to yell . Wishing without any fulfillment in action . Now it was altogether different . Altogether . He felt exactly as if he had embarked upon a journey : that was the kernel of the sensation . A feeling of excitement , a little tune of invigorating words running through his mind : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all behind , I am going .. . Perhaps , Alan considered soberly , it was because he had told Pat . Telling her had weighed on his mind , he was willing to admit now . The poor kid had been startled , but at that she had taken it rather well . Even he felt a pull : the centrifugal force of custom and comfort pulling against the equal power of the tangent-course . Force was the exact word . Take this placid lake . Disparagingly he kicked a little sand toward it , with his sneaker toe . A pretty poor excuse for a great body of water , an ocean . The waves were meager  --  puny and unreal . There was no tide , no true force : you could n't be afraid , and hence could not respect it . This Chicago-lake ! Yet , he had come this far , working  --  it suddenly occurred to him  --  farther and farther from the East . From the part of the country which was dead or stagnant or stationary , whatever you said to best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight with . And he would never be content ?  | so he felt with this new confidence in him  --  with something left merely to be finished . As George had inherited his steel plant , already in operation  --  or , for that matter , like Alan 's own father , sitting there in Lawsonville . No , he wanted to fashion something new , something that would grow from the seed under his care . George would never know that pleasure ; although , Alan reflected in parenthesis , in an earlier epoch , George himself would have been an empire-builder . Now what was there for him to do but hold his own ? Try to keep the ground from crumbling away under his feet ? But Tom . Tom , in his own way , fashioning something new . Alan could sympathize with the desire if not the end in Tom 's case . He walked on again , farther away from the crowd . In the tufted grass of the little bluff he spied an old board , and went over to pry it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white , with little bugs clinging to the downside . He dragged it along behind him , going back to them now . His feelings were not so clear that he did not wish for a better expression of them . And again he thought of Tom . Tom could have interpreted , explained . If he had taken to writing novels . Still , he would have had his own explanations ; and no two people see eye to eye on first causes . Out of the corner of her eye Pat saw Alan far down the beach . As she talked with Ed her eyes followed his retreating figure as a person will do , concentrating on an object when deeply absorbed in conversation . Ed 's words , pumped out of him with less difficulty now that she had primed him thoroughly , sounded like the unfolding of a tragedy . The end was known , and with meticu-  | lous words Ed was explaining how Alan had reached therebut oh , no , it could n't be the place for them ! Hiding her shame , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very long , Alan had been planning . Since  --  but it was so distant in forgotten winter months that she could hardly remember anything that had been happening to them then . She tried desperately to remember . If she could recall one instant , and place herself back in time , then perhaps she could better understand . It must have been something she had done ; something she had said lightly , certainly not meaning . It must be her fault , otherwise he would not have kept his plans so secret . Ed had not known until a week or two ago  --  but Alan 's wife ! That was the shame , the hurt . She was hardly listening to Ed 's words now ; his dry voice sounded like doom and she did not have the heart , right now , to listen closely . Suddenly all these people here tonight meant more than they ever had before . She had n't appreciated them nearly enough . A little extravagantly , she thought she understood how a man condemned to die must feel : as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; as if he had never studied the infinite configurations of cloud forms , the color of all living things . Here was George coming over to them . It hurt twice as much because of what he and Lydia had just told her this evening . Lydia had at last won , and George had consented to build in the suburbs . Not a mile from their own house ! At last to have Lydia near her , only to be snatched away , to California ! But why ? " What 's this about California ? " George was asking . He seated himself , tailor fashion , on the sand between Ed and Pat .  | " Oh , this idea of Alan 's , " Pat said heartlessly . George looked at Ed . " What idea ? " He was listening with half an ear . It sounded like something serious , and he did n't want to hear anyone else 's troubles . He had enough of his own . Of course , he had anticipated what would happen to the plant , as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. Steel . Capitulating to Lewis and his C. I. 0 . ! Christ ? ! Ed was fumbling for words and looking embarrassed . " It 's nothing , just an idea . Alan and I were working ? " " It is something ! " Pat burst out desperately . Perhaps George would see how absurd , how unfair .. . " Well , I have n't heard about it , " George said . " You might as well tell me . I suppose Al 's just been too busy to bring it up at a directors ' meeting . " " We were n't exactly ready , " Ed said with obvious reluctance . " We thought at the next meeting . . . But I guess it wo n't do any harm now ? " " Tell him , " Pat insisted , and leaned forward while Ed explained , putting in words for him here and there . George stopped them before they had gone far . " Why , this is crazy ! This is n't any time . . . Look here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 're having our troubles , troubles enough . No time for expansion . . . . And California ! " " Alan 's already overworked , he told me so himself , " Pat interrupted . " He has too much to do . " " Well , that 's probably so ? " " I had n't thought about that , " Ed said . George shook his head . He had been uneasy about Alan for a long time  --  ever since that business about the interview in the labor paper . Boundless energy , Al had , but with a  | slight tendency to go fantastic . And who in the office could temper those ideas  --  direct his energy ? " Chicago , " he told them solemnly , " is the keystone of the nation . You have to be near the source of supplies . Out in California ? " " But ? " Ed began . George smiled tactfully . Ed was much worse than Alan . " Out in California , " he repeated , " you 're way away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advantage of Chicago . " " That 's it ! " Pat cried . George had explained it . She was n't being foolish or selfish or anything . It was good business to stay here . " Now , do n't tell Al you said anything to me , " George warned her . " Why not ? " " No , " Ed agreed hastily . " No , you 'd better not , Pat . " Lydia was calling to them from across the fire . Why did n't they come and help ? Everything was nearly ready . She told Alan to place one end of his board in the flame . The configurations which had been formed by the picnickers , the little groups they had fallen into , broke up with that summons , and everybody began crowding forward with paper plates , letting Elsie serve them with wienies , and Jane give them potato salad . Pat put a bun on each plate and offered the mustard and the piccalilli . The conversation became general and desultory as they ate . Everybody was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost at sea , and they all turned to ask Ed 's opinion , as the pilot among them . Alan was helping Frank put the beer into a tubful of ice . The other was talking about his new  | position with his company ; pretty setup . Alan wondered if Frank really thought he 'd be a top executive someday . That was the trouble with working for a big corporation : you slaved away your life , being loyal and shrewd for them . Then one day they kicked you out with a little pension and a lot of thanks . " Think your company will ever transfer you ? " Alan asked him . Frank shook his head vigorously . " Hell , no . This is our main office . " " But Bob Griffon was sent to St. Louis , remember . " " Rather give up my job , " Frank blustered . Alan did n't believe that . " And go into business for yourself ? " He wondered how other people felt . " Ever think of that , Frank ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of small businesses fail before they 're on their feet . I 've got a good berth . And with this damned government regimentation , you could n't  --  say , did you see in the paper the other day how much we 're in debt ? The federal deficit has just been announced  --  two and a half billions more  --  that makes thirtyfive billions ! " That seemed to clinch the argument for him , in some obscure way . Alan nodded and went on eating . Pretty soon Frank stepped across the fire to talk with George , and Alan heard the words " thirty-five billions ! " again . Florence Trumble caught his eye and smiled . " You 'd think people could find something else to talk about , would n't you ? Just once in a while ! " She sighed . Alan moved nearer so they could talk . Together , after the plates were empty , they helped pack knives and forks and  | thermos bottles and napkins away in hampers , and then by common consent came back to their side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pat with unfamiliar volubility . Florence was silent beside him and as he lay there in the soft sand , feeling it in his shoes , in the cuffs of his trousers , picking it up with his hands and letting it drain through his fingers , a sudden urgency possessed him to belie the repose his body expressed . I 'm not getting any younger , he thought . There is n't a minute to lose , when you come right down to it . We do n't live long enough . . . . Pat has time ; she 's had all her years to know this place and these people . And yet she continues to want to know them , and find out more about them . I know enough already , in four brief years . These people are interesting and lovable to her , I guess , because they are part of her , and she sees herself in them in a quite literal way . She 's singing an old song now , a song they all remember together . And she remembers what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even George today eclipses the picture I had of him in college . Two different people . He has changed  --  and I ? I always change , but remain myself  --  I hope . Yes , I 'm sure I do . Because a place is never strange or inhospitable to me . I recognize myself in any environment  --  which would n't always be true if I changed , would it ? I recognize myself anywhere I am , and therefore it becomes part of me . Not I , a part of it . That 's the difference . " What are you thinking , for goodness sake ! " Florence exclaimed . " Oh , nothing  --  everything . Why ? " " I could hear your brain going a mile a minute . " Alan laughed . " I used to envy George , " he said out loud , going on with his thoughts . " I do n't any more . Suddenly , I don't. "  | " Is n't that funny , I 've always supposed he envied you . I think most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now , why in hell ? Someone had said that before , once ... . " Yes , " Florence went on , " because you 've  --  well , seen a good deal . No one can take all that away . . . . I have that impression although I do n't really know half what you did before you came to Chicago . " She laughed . " I suppose it sounds trite and funny , but I 've always thought your life would make a grand book . " " Could n't . It is n't finished . I 'm about to ? " He changed his mind about telling her . After all , the plan was n't quite ripe yet . Let the directors put their sanction on it before he spread the news . " Do y'know any ranches out in California ? " he asked her . They 'd have to live near Los Angeles , of course . Although Pat should see San Francisco ; there was a city ... . " I mean , you know , places with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Florence looked at him in surprise . " You are n't thinking of retiring ? " she laughed . " No . Just wondering . Happened to think of some guys I know out there . Trying to visualize .. : " He trailed off . They 'd go down to Palm Springs on week ends sometimes , or up in the mountains . Those crystal lakes , like deep mirrors . And if they grew tired of sunshine , why , there was snow . Or the desert . The desert in bloom . . . . Barney What's-his-name must still be out there . And Phil Mayer : he 'd seen in the Alumni Weekly that good old Phil was out there writing scenarios . That would give Pat an insight into the movies ,  | and of course at first she 'd be excited about Hollywood . But most of all , the mountains after these damned , dull plains ... . " Say , " he turned to Florence , " you 've never really told me about you trip to Rio last winter . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lloyd 's movies ? He really took some gorgeous ones in color . " " Something besides horse races ? " " At my insistence . Why do n't you and Pat come over tomorrow night ? He just loves showing them , and maybe you would n't be bored . " " I 'd like to . . . . Here , what do you say , let 's have a bottle of beer ? " Pat lay staring at the embers of the fire . All the songs had been sung now , all the watermelon rinds lay , a tinge of scarlet on the white and green cores , scattered about the glowing ashes . For some time no one had added any wood to the fire . She was feeling better now . George had said the plan was n't good business  --  and had n't Alan said , " It 's for you " ? As if she cared about more money , as if she wanted anything more ! Had she ever seemed discontented ? For Alan 's own good , he must not go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a burden sometimes . Just a little . She might have been extravagant about one little thing . From now on , she 'd be doubly careful . She 'd even send that dress back , which she really did need . But no doubt she was careless at times ; it was n't at all fair to Alan . Even when he urged her to buy some new clothes , she should n't relent . And besides  --  another reason had come to her  --  she had an even more important right to talk to George about this plan . A long time ago she had resolved what she would do  | with her inheritance . Of course , she hoped mother would live forever , but someday there would be money for herself and Connie . She would n't tell Alan anything about it , but privately she had always planned to invest in Steel Houses . Get a broker to buy up some of the stock , some way , so that Alan would be better represented in the firm . Yes , that was the seat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Often she did n't understand what Alan was thinking , but this she did know . So that , if she was practically a stockholder  --  would be , at least had n't she a right to say what she felt about California ? Especially when George agreed ? If Alan would only sit tight , just be patient ... . Frank , who had had too much beer , was swaying around , stepping on people . His wife Elsie stood up . " I think we really should go , " she said . " It 's Saturday night  --  Fourth of July eve , " they reminded her . " Have t'go early mass , jus ' t'same , " Frank replied a little incoherently . No one else wanted to leave , but the spell was broken . They began getting up and shaking the sand out of the blankets and figuring out what belonged to whom . Suddenly Pat realized that Alan was still talking to Florence . He had been far away all evening , almost as if he had avoided her . Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for firewood . That time on their honeymoon . . But she said nothing , and together with Ed picked up the hamper , and tramped back to where the cars were parked . Alan went with Florence and Lloyd first , making arrange-  | ments to see the movies tomorrow night . He heard Pat calling , " We 're waiting for you , " and was almost vexed . When he finally came back to the car , she did not say anything but Ed made some remark about a tired girl . Alan tried to put his arm around Pat but she would n't let him . " What 's the matter ? " he asked her , puzzled . Pat still said nothing , and let him think about that all the way home . She could hardly wait until they were there . It was silly of her to act that way with Alan . But her sudden awakening on the beach and the realization that he was far away from her , and had been all evening , had pricked the balloon of delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked to George and Ed . Oh , it must be right , what she had done ! " Just put the hamper down , anywhere ! " she told Alan as soon as they were inside their own door . He had explained to her why he had gone to speak to Florence . " Alan , love me ! " Pat demanded , and he complied eagerly , so that everything seemed all right again . " We love each other more than anything else , do n't we ? " she whispered . " So that nothing else matters , so that we 're ? ? " " To hell with Lloyd 's movies tomorrow ! " he responded . " What do you say we stay home and have a  --  sort of a second honeymoon ? " He did love her still , of course . And in this instant she realized that she possessed a favor which she could withhold or bestow : her consent to his desire . A dangerous feeling , she knew , but thrilling , heightening her own want of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , Alan ! " The house , like the suburban village , had grown very quiet .  | A clock striking somewhere announced that it was one o'clock . Softly , so as not possibly to wake Alan , Pat turned over on her back and lay there . Not a single whisper of breeze came from the Norway maple outside their window , and the air was like warm , soothing water ; she could hardly tell what was her body and what the surrounding darkness . As she lay there , feeling complete and satisfied and made whole , a curious memory came to her . Once , when father had come home with a present of a doll for her , she had told him how beautiful it was , only to rush from the room , run up the heavy carpeted stairs all the way to the third-floor nursery and fling herself on her bed to cry . It was a wonderful doll , and she could not understand herself . Except that all at once she had wanted only her old ones , the ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undressed , wigless and ugly and bald , with paint scratched off their once-pretty faces . It was natural , she knew now , for children to feel that way about their old dolls . The important thing was that she had lied about the new one . And lying , she had felt overwhelmingly sorry for father , not for herself at all . He had been so proud , so generous , so sure she would like the new doll better than the old ones .  | CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE Ir WAS the midst of summer now . This morning Alan woke with a feeling of excitement for which , in his still drowsy state , he could find no reason . But almost immediately he remembered : today was the fatal moment  --  the directors ' meeting , when he would disclose his west-coast plan . He took a cold shower in preparation for the battle , although it would not occur until noon , and dressed painstakingly . They were at breakfast before he said a word to Pat . Then a sudden hesitancy deterred him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to be big news today . " Pat opened her eyes wide ; she did not remember . " Yes , " he went on mysteriously , " and tonight your husband requests the pleasure of his wife 's company at the Edgewater Beach , for dinner and dancing and general revelry . " " Oh , fun ! " she exclaimed . " But , what ? ? " " Never mind . Meet me at the club . I 'll go there to clean up , " he told her . For some reason he decided not to reveal the secret . As he got on the train , waving good-by to her , he tried to tell himself it was better that she should hear about an accomplished fact than fret all day alone . Of course , she had n't been overjoyed with the idea when he first told her the night of the picnic . How could she fully appreciate California when she had  | never seen it ? After the die was cast , he would enlarge upon the joys , the beauties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his last-minute rehearsal at the office this morning . He ached to see his plan once more : all neatly typed , first in outline , then in great detail , with telling excerpts from the great file of letters he 'd accumulated . That could n't help but win the day . Not that he was utterly confident that the directors would fall in line at once , but their natural resistance made it all the more worth fighting for . He had gone over his presentation too often for them to fire a question he could n't answer . And now with the Court Bill defeated in Congress , they 'd be bound to feel happier about the fate of the country . It was the psychological moment . And even if Ed had lost interest in the idea recently , Alan was sure that he could swing it alone , singlehanded . He 'd be generous , willingly sharing the credit with Ed . But the directors would see who was the prime mover of Steel Houses , Incorporated . He wished that the train would hurry up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hid it from any chance acquaintance who might be coming down the aisle and would want to sit down and chat about lesser things . By two o'clock Alan was sitting at the club bar with George and Ed . It was all over , that quickly . In hardly more than an hour an idea which he had fathered since the winter had been presented , considered , and the answer given . " I think I 'll have another drink , " Alan announced . He did not ask the other two , but they complied readily enough : Ed ,  | who always drank moderately , and George , who seldom touched liquor during the day . He had not asked them to join him at the bar . By common consent , they had followed . The first highball had been consumed in silence , as if nothing had happened . Nothing had happened ! The waiter brought the drinks , collecting their empty glasses and carefully wiping the table . Alan enclosed his glass with his fingers , jiggling it so that the ice rattled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . None of them had any idea what this meant to him . " Well , " he said , trying to make his voice sound normal , " that 's that . " Now that the silence had been broken , George leaned forward . It was about time George said something . " About that man Walters I suggested we put in the office with you , " he began . " He 'll be a great help , I know that . Later on ? " " Undoubtedly , " Alan said dryly . That was all they had given him : an office manager , suggested by George and quickly voted . Almost as quickly as they had said no to his west-coast plan . No , they had said : just like that . The moment he sat down , before he had touched his jellied consomme , before he 'd so much as brought up the subject . They had known about it . George , they said , " had heard , " and had prepared them . Of course , they had talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The very idea of expansion in the face of present conditions , they objected , was quite absurd , to say nothing about the uncertainty of the west coast as a prospective field . To say nothing of Roosevelt and what he might do . Besides , there was the undistributed surplus earnings tax . No , Alan ,  | they had chorused gently , as if they were mildly reproving parents ; although we appreciate your efforts . But you ca n't be expected to know , they hinted , the complexities of the financial end . And then George had recommended an office manager who would understand . Not very subtle , that . At least Alan had made Ed declare himself , too . After their refusal , he had not hesitated to say : And what does Ed think ? Ed thought Alan had too much work to do : that was his contribution . Funny , how Ed suddenly appeared so cognizant of the details of the office , which he had always waved aside heretofore . How did he happen to know , all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed him up here to the bar , showing by this conciliatory action that they had betrayed him  --  yes , it was no less a word than that  --  they could expect to submit to his inquisition . Presently they would reveal themselves ; he would let them put their guilt in their own mouths . This was not pure vindictiveness on his part , he recognized even in his cold rage and disappointment . It was more than that ; he was not doing this merely for his own satisfaction , to preserve something of his pride . What he must confirm was one suspicion . " I take it , " he said slowly , " that the directors knew about the plan all along . " George picked up his drink , watching Ed . It was easy to see that Alan was mad as hops , and he was searching for some way to explain to him . The completeness of Alan 's project was most impressive . That it was n't sound business at this time was beside the point . And , George resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older men because the Anderson Steel Plant would have derived little benefit from the units constructed in California . He wanted to talk to  | Alan alone . But he would have to answer Alan 's question first , and implicate Ed ; there was no way around that . " The other night at the picnic , " he told Alan , " Ed mentioned your idea casually . I did n't gather it was a secret , Al . According to him you were about all set , then . " Ed cleared his throat . " To tell the truth , Al , I did n't have any conception of what was worrying you till that night . It was pretty unobservant of me , but ? " " What was worrying me ? " Alan asked him sharply . It was coming now , and he could restrain himself no longer . Ed did not seem to notice the change in his tone . " Well , that there was too much in the office for you to attend to . Pat said you talked a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What 's that got to do with the west-coast idea ? " Alan asked him . He had it , now . His suspicions were confirmed : Pat had told them . " Just this , Al , " George put in hastily . " With Walters in the office , you 'll be able to devote all your energy to building up the business around Chicago . You 'd got to the point where you did n't have time to sell . . . . I know Ed would have strung along with you on the California branch if the directors had been able to subscribe a new stock issue  --  and that 's what would have been necessary . You 'd have gone along , would n't you , Ed ? " Ed was sitting on the edge of his chair . " Yes , yes , of course , " he said eagerly . " Personally , I 'd like to have seen it go through . But when they showed why they could n't ? " He hesitated , looking at his half-full glass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apologized , " I think I 'll leave you . I wanted to go out to the airport ? " " Sure , that 's all right , " George assented , relieved .  | Alan broke away from his thoughts . " See you Monday , " he said wearily . He wished to God they both would go . " You need n't stick around , " he told George . " I have to stay here and dress because I 'm meeting Pat tonight . " " No , " George said . Now that Ed was gone , he was free to talk . " I want you to get this straight , Al . I did n't chime in because I thought my plant would lose business . That was n't the reason at all . " " I did n't think you did . " Alan felt weak now ; he 'd been hit below the belt . None of the rest of this fiasco made any difference now . So Pat had told them , at the picnic . It had meant that much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing made him feel sick . He did n't even want this second highball . " Look here , old boy , " George said in his most ingratiating manner  --  the way he talked to casual acquaintances , winning them . " We 've just started , and there 's more than one way to kill a cat . Do n't think I do n't realize what you 're up against . " " What 's that ? " " Between you and me  --  Ed Haywood . He should n't be president of the company . " Alan laughed . " You see ? " George pursued the idea eagerly . " I just wanted you to know ? " " You 're hard as nails , are n't you , George ? " Alan asked him . " Anything goes as long as it 's good business , eh ? " " Do n't get sarcastic and talk like Tom , for Christ 's sake . There 's no use fooling ourselves . We both know Ed is n't a practical man . . You may not believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had your plan lined up . That was a real job . " " Thanks . "  | " I mean it . And I 'll show you I 'm not talking through my hat . If you ever feel cramped  --  you get what I mean  --  I know where you can have more leeway . In other words , if you want to move in with me , I 've got a desk for you . Labeled sales manager . No strings attached . " Alan began laughing again . Good old George , dense as they made them . " How 's it feel to be a big shot ? " he asked bitterly . George looked surprised and offended . " Well , it 's up to you . The offer stands , fella . " " No thanks . I 'm no quitter , I 'll stay where I am . " It did n't matter now . But George could n't see the real trouble , he did n't know ... . George finished his drink . " I think I 'll run along , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's arm . " No hard feelings ? " " I do n't blame you , " Alan answered squarely . " We 'll forget the whole thing . " " Well , do n't get tight . It 's bad to drink alone . " " I 'm through now , " Alan said . " I think I 'll go take a swim . " That would clear his head . And he wanted to clear it thoroughly , before he saw Pat tonight .  | CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR THE headwaiter guided them to their reserved table beneath the trees , which when it grew dark would be softly aglow with blue lights that festooned their branches . Alan had asked for a table on the edge of the terrace where they could look out toward the beach and , when the music stopped , hear the faint , distant lapping of the waves . Even though a number of diners were already here the sun had not yet set , and the yellow light simply made more vivid the greenness of the leaves , the chairs and tables . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quickening song and there was the pleasant sound of plates being laid , and a little hum of voices , and laughter from the other diners . A few couples had got up to dance on the floor that would be crowded later on in the evening . A waiter hovered by their table , and Alan asked Pat what sort of cocktail she wanted . " Whatever you 're having , " she said . At any other time the tune that was being played would have made her itch to dance , and she would already have noticed the dresses of the women , those that were chic and those that were fussily overelegant . But the one sentence Alan had uttered as soon as he met her had stripped her of all pleasure in this occasion . After he had left home this morning she had guessed that today must be the fatal directors ' meeting , and she had wanted to  | cry , remembering the assurance and confidence he had displayed at breakfast . For she had been certain of the outcome . Her arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her the night of the picnic . By lunchtime she had nearly made up her mind to call Alan and tell him she had a headache and could n't meet him . But that was not the brave thing to do ; it was her duty to try to make him forget . No matter how difficult and sad the evening would be , with his hopes dashed to the ground , it was up to her to be everything that he liked about her . It was up to her to set their lives on an even keel once more . And the dread which , had weighed upon her all the way into town was somewhat alleviated by the feeling that the storm was over . She thought she had known how he would react , but one look at Alan 's face had shocked her . And he had said , " Well , you wo n't have to move to California . They saw to that , all right . " . The way he phrased it worried her . But instead of raging , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared , he had buried his hurt . And when she had suggested that perhaps he did n't feel like dancing , he had said , " At least you ought to be glad . " Then for the first time , through his bitterness she realized fully what this must have meant to him . No matter if it was foolish , no matter how much her intuition and desires , seconded by George , rebelled against the idea , he had set tremendous store by this venture . As he so obviously preferred to forget it , there was nothing to do but try to divert him , and Pat began exclaiming over things , telling him she felt light-headed after one cocktail ,  | and pointing out all the romantic elements of this setting , acting the part it often amused Alan for her to play . But she did it with a faint heart , and as soon as they had ordered dinner , she begged him to dance . More people had come in and the dance floor no longer looked deserted . Pat held Alan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Despite his big , ungainly ways , Alan could dance well when the spirit moved him ; but tonight it was an effort and he was not succeeding . He was glad when Pat suggested they had better go back to their dinner . The music was good and , as it grew dark and the blue lights in the trees came on , an unreality invested the scene , separating it from any other part of life . Then , halfway through dinner , his pretense failed him . He set down his knife and fork . " Are n't you hungry ? " Pat asked . She had been watching him every minute , afraid and yet knowing that eventually there would be some sign . She reached over and squeezed his hand . " Darling , " she implored him , " do n't believe you 've failed , just because your idea was turned down ? " " Failed ? " he echoed . " You do n't think Alan Reed 's licked that easily , do you ? " Then before he knew it he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we have failed , you and I. " She caught her breath . Then he really must know she had spoken to George and Ed . " Alan , I did n't say anything , " she protested , " except to tell Ed you had too much work to do . They did n't realize  --  you do have , you told me so . And now they 've given you another man . All I told them ? " " I know , " Alan interrupted . He was thinking of mother and father . Born out of their restlessness , their dissension . But he clamped his teeth shut on any further words .  | Pat was insistent . " Just because I felt that Chicago  --  we 'll be so much happier here ? " " Please , Pat , let 's not talk about it . " " But you said  --  oh , we ca n't be like this , Alan ! " She spoke low , hating to have to talk here , yet feeling that everything must be spoken , right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' like this , ' " he answered . He had given up eating altogether now , fighting the words which might be said . " I want you to tell me what you think I 've done , " Pat persisted . " Shall we dance ? " " No . Tell me , Alan , please . " " What is this pretense , Pat ? You know .... Do you mean to say you 've forgotten the night after we got home from the picnic ? Our ' second honeymoon ' ? How about that  --  after ? ? You wanted to stay here so badly you would n't stop at ? " " Alan , do n't say that ! " With an effort Pat controlled herself . The people around them , at tables only a few feet away , could not have noticed anything was happening . A " scene " was bad enough anywhere , but here it would be humiliating for them both . Oh , why had she acquiesced to this evening ? " We seem to be going in different directions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now that he had started , it was only honest to tell her his feelings . " The directors ' refusing my plan is n't one-two-three to what 's happening to us . " What are we going to do ? " she cried . If Alan had slapped her in the face she could have borne it more easily than this . " We 're not going to do anything , of course . Do n't get dramatic about it , " he said coldly . " We wo n't have any theatricals .... You asked me what I meant , that 's all . "  | She hardly heard what he was saying . It was not the words , but his voice  --  further from her now than ever before . As she looked across the table at him she saw someone she did not know . " You 're treating me like a child ! " she objected . This was all wrong , everything was wrong , and the sound of the music and the sight of people enjoying themselves made her only the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I should think , " she told him , nursing her own hurt now . " Then you 've got to face the facts , Pat , " he answered quietly . " It 's done , let 's not talk any more about it . Let 's forget it . " As if they could , Pat thought desperately . She wanted to ask him what facts he wanted her to face , but her pride would not allow her . Between them they had erected a barrier of little , hateful words . Very well . Let Alan dismantle them .  | CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE Tom WHITE had a perfectly good opinion of himself , but all the same he was taken aback at this welcome Pat and Alan were giving him . As they urged him to have another cocktail and pressed more crackers upon him , as they shared a Sunday lunch which was admittedly far superior to his usual fare  --  all the while their overly hospitable actions gave him a strange impression that he could n't quite define . Instead of enjoying their bright house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked out upon Pat 's carefully pruned garden , he felt distinctly uncomfortable and stuffy . They were too politely affable today : Alan was n't his old argumentative self and Pat was subdued , making conversation as if he were a stranger . The whole atmosphere was so queer and unlike them that he did not even feel free to clear the air by asking what it was all about . And he was tired of doing most of the talking . One fact was soon plain : they always spoke to him rather than to each other . Not once had either of them uttered an intimate remark to the other . Finally by mid-afternoon his curiosity got the better of him . When Alan went upstairs for a moment he seized the opportunity . " What 's wrong with Alan today ? " he asked Pat . It was a leading question which she could ignore if she chose .  | Her face immediately went tragic ; she must have been waiting for this chance to unmask . " You 've noticed it ? Oh , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd say something ! " " Wait a minute . I do n't know what you 're talking about . " She leaned forward , glancing furtively toward the door . " I simply have to get away for a while . . . . Take me to Ravinia tonight , wo n't you , Tommy ? I mean , you suggest it ? " " In the first place , I have n't enough money , to tell you the plain truth . " It hurt a little to say that , and yet he did n't relish becoming embroiled in some sort of family squabble . For that must be why he had been asked : to put himself between them , in order that they could avoid the issue , whatever it was , because of his presence . " I 'll buy the tickets , " Pat assured him hastily . " We can sit outside where people wo n't see us . " " How about Alan ? I ca n't say ? " " Do n't worry . He wo n't go . " Foolishly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the afternoon seemed interminable . And when he broached the subject of Ravinia , Alan 's insistence that the two of them must go sounded almost as if he were in on the conspiracy . They were all just too cordial as they foraged for their own supper in the kitchen . With definite relief , Tom at last told Pat it was time to be on their way . Alan gave him the keys to the car and opened the doors of the garage for them . " Well , I 'm glad that 's over , " Tom sighed . " It was getting a bit too strained . " Pat did n't say anything , but sat beside him quietly , her head leaning back against the seat . " Even though I 'm not in the habit of being taken places by  | gals , " he added , " beggars ca n't ride horseback , and I have n't been to Ravinia since the old days . " " You 're a darling to do this for me , " Pat thanked him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It 's pretty evident something 's wrong . But do n't explain unless you want to , " he advised her . He had no desire to hear confidences . Not from Pat . Her remarks had forged a kind of intimacy between them that made him wince , remembering that mad summer of the fair . He would have made her miserable , no doubt . But he smiled to himself as he reflected that if she had accepted him , he knew for a fact that father would have settled a nice income on their heads . The only satisfaction had been thwarting that benign move . " I do n't think I 'll try to explain , " Pat told him . " You do n't know how glad I was when Alan said he 'd asked you to come out ! Because I 'm sure you 'll understand , Tommy . " Why should he understand ? " If I were you , I 'd just forget about it for the time being , " he suggested . For the first time in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face a serious problem quite alone . How serious it was , whether nothing more than a little spat or something that had been growing and no one noticing , he had no clue . In any case he suspected it was hard going for Pat . She 'd never been tossed about , she had always been sheltered by that quixotic mother of hers whom he never could bear . The remarkable thing was not that Pat was normal and impeccably decent and probably shocked to death by her uncertainty and instability now  --  not that , but that her sister Connie had turned out to be such an independent character . " If you want me to turn on the sympathy , just shout , " he offered . " Otherwise , you wo n't mind if I 'm stony-hearted and  | enjoy myself , will you ? This is a real treat for me , you 've no idea . " She patted his arm . " You are a good boy , " she acknowledged . At the gate they bought general admission tickets and because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trees where it was already dark and no one would be likely to recognize them . Tom acquiesced to her desire for privacy ; certainly he did n't give a hang about seeing anyone he knew . He read the program notes and slapped mosquitoes and kept smoking cigarettes in a vain attempt to keep them away , until Pat finally suggested that he go and buy some punk to burn  --  that was the best preventative , she said . The leaves of the trees and the flower borders appeared weirdly vivid under the artificial lights , and he recalled the years ago when there was opera here and he had come with other youngsters and sat inside the pavilion under the same Japanese lanterns and smelled the citronella that had been swabbed over the thin pillars . Quiet days , lazy summers , when there was hope and aspiration and he had not been compelled , by some force he had ceased trying to call by any name , to seek a more stony trail . At least no longer did he have to ask himself if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things simply existed  --  so far as his own bodily reactions were concerned . Only his eyes , he thought , his eyes and those gray-coiled , intestine-like lobes which are the brain , lived on . And would outlast all these people , see them doomed because they had never listened , and had failed to read the handwriting on the wall .  | A flutter of handclapping informed him that the first violinist had come on the stage , and he hurried back with the two pieces of punk , which reminded him of childhood Fourths of July . The lights dimmed , the conductor ascended the podium to fervent applause , his arms were raised , and a stillness ensued , broken only by the distant , haunting sound of a train across the Skokie meadows . And then faintly , like the barely audible stirring of leaves , the violins began the first movement . Tom settled back against the uncomfortable bench , closing his eyes , his piece of lighted punk clasped in his hands and occassionally the pungency blowing up to his nostrils . Music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in Mozart or the other established gods . But this excursion into the eighteenth century , he prophesied , would receive the most applause of all ; not because the audience was enthralled  --  they would prefer some florid romantic to this dry precision  --  but because they had been taught Mozart was one of the masters . Tom himself was waiting for Respighi at the end of the program .... If he kept his eyes open , he discovered , any tendency toward illusion vanished , and he could pity the musicians , suffering in that glaringly lighted shell . A wonder they were allowed to play without coats . Beside him Pat sat quietly , then seemed to stir . This music did things to her . She could understand it , she could respond . It was making her pulse beat faster again , a pulse that must have nearly stopped often since she had had this altercation with Alan . Quite obviously she was deciding some course ? not deciding perhaps , but feeling , probably without any words at all . People feared words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harsh commitment of a phrase . He  | was quite sure of his deductions about Pat , because in the old days here at Ravinia she had actually broken forth with bravos . In the days when she was so freshly , incredibly young  --  young , he had always felt , except for her red-gold hair , which to him seemed like the crowning attribute of a mature and knowledgeable woman . Often then she had turned to him , the words spontaneously flowing out , so that he knew she must be seeing fairy castles and knights in shining armor , and brave deeds . Those were the days when Bori and Johnson sang together , and Martinelli in his Pagliacci costume , and Rethberg , and the handsome , Latin Mojica and all the others she adored . It was maddening and ridiculous that he and Pat could already look back to a past that might be called more glamorous than the present . So she must think of it , and tonight he also was involuntarily becoming susceptible . The enervating tentacles of memory .. . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from people . When they were in the shadows , Pat asked , " Do you mind if I take your arm ? " Gallantly he tried to produce a self that was in keeping with her mood ; it was not he , it might not even be Alan , that she needed . Only perhaps a memory ? Women , women ! Unpredictable in their necessities , totally incapable of being forecast in any single action , thought or mood . He let it go at that . Before the bugle called them back , he bought her an ice-cream cone . She licked it with her pink tongue like a small child . And as they found their bench again , she whispered , " Tom , do you remember when ? " and he was glad that he could silence her , for the last number was beginning .  | Damn such small , conniving , nostalgic details ! Tonight had been nothing but a remembrance , to plague him ... . The Pines of Rome completed the spell , which was only broken by Pat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd ; they might be seen by their friends . On the way home she was entirely different . Her gaiety was infectious , and he found himself also laughing and forgetful . He did not stop to consider whether she was mercurial or whether the evening had really stopped a wound , healing some deep hurt within her . In this mood he did not want to analyze , and it was too short a time until they were at the driveway . " You poor thing , having to take an electric into town at this hour ! " Pat exclaimed , suddenly remembering . He brushed the inconvenience aside , and drove on into the garage which Alan had thoughtfully left open for them . " It 's been fun , " he thanked her . " It has been , has n't it ? " He thought she sounded wistful . At the door he told her good night , refusing to come in for a snack before he walked to the station . Pat put out her hand . " I ca n't thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , suddenly , she kissed him . Without a word he turned and walked away swiftly , his heels clicking sharply on the sidewalk where a still bright and romantic moon laid a pattern through the trees . His hands were thrust deep in his pockets , clenched tight .  | CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX " I REALLY do n't know where the summer 's gone , " Florence sighed . They were all lazing in the side yard under the bright beach umbrella  --  Florence and Lloyd Trumble , and Tom and Pat . The sun was very hot and dazzling . The tennis had made Lloyd sleepy . He humpfed and shifted his fat legs . All through lunch , with the aid of a stiff drink , he had growled about the sudden slump in the stock market , right after it had gained the highest point since March . " I wish it were gone ! " Pat cried so fiercely that she broke their calm . She seemed the only one alive now , and that irritated her . She had had more than enough of Lloyd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But this hot , sultry afternoon-feeling was worse . Even the garden  --  it once had been mother 's garden  --  made her despair , and she stared unseeingly through the late August flowers , the bright fuchsia and white notes of the phlox . Oh , how could they be content to sit here , letting the hours go by ! It was all right for summer to disappear  --  she did n't care about it any longer , she 'd hardly tended her own garden these last weeks . But for the sunlit hours to slip away ? bringing night closer . Night , when it would be time to go upstairs and undress . . . . She tried to cast the thought from her ; it had become an obsession , she must n't let it . " I 've got to go , " she said abruptly .  | Tom stood up too , signifying that of course he would take her home . Florence protested . " Do n't go ! " But when they were adamant , she conceded , " Well , make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom . It 's been so much fun having you two over all the time . " " I have to get dressed , " Pat said , remembering to make excuses now . " I 'm going to Lydia 's for supper because Alan wo n't be home . " She had just remembered  --  at least that was some consolation . Although it would have been as bad to eat alone . And night would come again ... . They got into the old car that Tom had been borrowing to come out for tennis . Pat slumped down in the seat . Her firm legs , bare and tan up to her shorts , stretched out stiffly under the dashboard . " Let 's ride somewhere  --  anywhere , " she commanded Tom . " Okay . It was getting stuffy , was n't it ? " She felt better already . Tom did understand , without having to be told so many things . Now she could relish the sunlight as Tom turned the car into Sheridan Road and they went up the hill , past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brick tower above the water plant , and wove down through the ravine . Just to ride , and ride , and keep those insistent thoughts out of her mind . Not that they were ever more than crowded back a little ways . . . . A courtesan , she suddenly said to herself . That 's all I am , a courtesan . That 's what Alan thinks of me , that 's the way he uses me , ever  --  ever since that night after the picnic . I did not do it for that ! I swear to God , I did n't . But that is  | what he believes . And maybe  --  maybe I am . But everything is all lost now , there is no meaning . And I dread the nights . It would almost be better if I said , No . Yet , ca n't he see that is n't possible ? Or perhaps he does  --  but he could n't be that cruel ! It was like this end of summer . The freshness gone and merely the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense without moisture and fertility . The real meaning of summer , gone . And what could you do ? Tom was driving on without a word , going north , and she continued her soliloquy : Sometimes at night I try to imagine it 's like before , but I ca n't . Except always , for that instant , that climax , it is , or seems to be . And I feel cheated , Alan has cheated me , because he has taught me to .. . " What ? " she had to say then , because she did not hear what Tom remarked . They had come to one of the suburban beaches , in the next village . " I said , let 's go down there . I 'll leave the car here , because they 'll see my Chicago license and kick me out of the park . " They walked through the trees over to the stone parapet that overlooked the beach , directly beneath them under the bluff . The lake , Tom said , reminded him today of the Mediterranean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof on the bathhouse . He leaned his elbows on the stone , and they smoked cigarettes . On one side a steep path led down between bright green shrubs . A group of little boys , brown as Indians , came running up , chasing one another , their voices shrill and careless . Down on the yellow sand children were yelling , throwing balls and turning somersaults , their legs twinkling below  | their bright , abbreviated suits . The float was crowded with them , too . Tom pointed the fingers which held his cigarette . " See that little girl  --  that one with the long blonde hair ? I 've been watching her . You can tell she has everything . Beauty , charm . And what will she grow up to be ? " " Maybe a restless woman who . . . Do you know , Tommy , " she changed quickly , " that things seem clearer , with you ? You make me define myself . " For the first time she observed him ; she had been too engrossed in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moody and taciturn again , not at all as he had been during these summer weeks . Now . he merely smiled at her quizzically . " I mean , " she explained , " you get things straight . I 've been thinking about what you told me the other day  --  about Wilson Brent . If I 'd been in your shoes , I 'd have gone to George , just as soon as I found out . I  --  we knew you did n't write that interview for your paper , but George would n't believe . " " Remember what I said ? I might have turned the story in myself . George said it , and I hated him for every word . I 'm not sure it was n't pride ? " " No , it 's something to do with your integrity . A different kind I 'm just beginning to find out about . Being true to what you deeply feel . Sometimes I 've been such a coward . . . " " You ? " He was surprised . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot , " she said impatiently . " Let 's go home and have some beer . . . . I wish you could stay for supper  --  maybe I could call Lydia and say I ca n't come . " He started to speak , but changed his mind , and they walked  | back to the car slowly . It was parked under a maple tree that hung its full leaves down so low that they had to stoop to get in the front seat . The street was deserted . In the distance Pat heard the faint hooting of an electric train , but it seemed very far away . Suddenly she was conscious that Tom had not started the motor but was staring at her . Then , and not until then , she knew . He took her in his arms and was kissing her madly . With both hands she tried to push him away , but he held her tightly . And for a moment she acquiesced . Then she recovered herself and when she pushed him harder , he relented . He started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arms was still upon her . So fiercely done  --  and yet with a kind of tenderness . She felt defiantly proud and happy . For the first time in weeks . Her warmth was chilled , however , as they drove up in front of her house . Of course Mrs. Hampton would have to be there in the garden next door ! " Oh , come on , " she said to him recklessly . What did it matter , after all ? She led the way to the kitchen hurriedly . Tom sat on the table while she bent down to get two bottles of beer out of the refrigerator . The door closed with a soft blug . " Where 's that trusty old Scandinavian cook you used to have ? " Tom asked . " Oh , Gunhild ? " In sudden panic she attacked one of the beer caps violently . The opener kept slipping off until Tom laughed and took it out of her hand . " But  --  but this is Thursday , you know , " she explained . Tom poured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | slight bead formed on the amber liquid . He handed it to Pat . " She always goes out on Thursday , " she found herself adding . Tom stared , uncomprehending . " Who does what ? " " Gunhild . Our cook . She always goes out on Thursday , and that 's today . Mother used to give the upstairs maid Fridays , but usually ? " " Oh . Yes . " This time he led the way , into the living room . To Pat it looked almost too neat and clean . So frightfully neat , with the pillows all puffed up and sitting in the corners , their edges like two alert dog 's ears , the way Gunhild insisted upon fixing them . Not a thing out of place ; irrelevantly , she noticed how bare the fireplace looked , cleaned of the winter 's ashes . That somehow contributed to the unlived-in appearance . " Perhaps I ought to redecorate this room , " she said spiritlessly . Tom drank down his beer . " Have some more , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , I guess so . " She was glad when he came back with two more sweating brown bottles . " It 's been a dreadful summer , " she began . " There 's been tennis . " " Yes , " she said eagerly . " Tommy , I ca n't tell you ? " " Do n't . " She watched his long thin fingers around the glass . " You have beautiful fingers , " she observed . " I was noticing the way you held your racket  --  the way you serve . . . You 're so sure , I mean . And when you throw yourself back ? " He was turning red under his tan and when she looked him  | square in the face he tried to laugh . " I 'm rusty . It 's been so long . . . But now I like playing again . Funny , is n't it ? " They had almost finished their second beers before she answered , " It is n't so funny . We used to , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pat . " " Are n't they ? " She gave a little laugh . " Very . Today I came out here with a very firm intention . I 'd decided to  --  well , stop playing tennis . " " Oh , no ? ! But your work , " she admitted . " I wish sometimes I had some work to ? " " You know it is n't that . Pat , we 've got to be frank now . It 's been a mistake , this  --  this tennis . " " No ! " She could not conceal her desperation . " Tommy , you must n't ? " " You could find someone else to ? " " How can you say that ? " He smacked his fist against his other palm . " I 'd better go right now . Thanks for the ? " " Get one more . " He obeyed , and as he left the room she put her fingers to her forehead , surprised that it felt cool . A late afternoon sun was streaming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pull down the Venetian blind so that the slipcover would not fade . . . . These little pretenses , to cover her real thoughts : it hardly mattered , any more . Everything had changed today . And yet she felt it had all happened before , that she had gone through the same thing , or dreamed it , up to a point . . . " Pat . " He was standing before her again . But when she looked up , he moved away , restlessly . His hands were  | clenched behind him . " I ca n't stand it any longer , " he said abruptly . " After today  --  what 's the use pretending ? We talk around the subject , when I . . . It 's been this way all summer for me . " " I did n't know , Tommy . I honestly did n't , " she told him softly . Her finger spread a drop of beer that was spilled on the glass top of the coffee table . " I did n't know  --  until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . . . . How I felt , I mean . " " A hell of a mess ! " he cried angrily . " You 're disgusted , " she guessed . " You 're disgusted with yourself because you 're  --  so strong , Tommy , and ? " " I 'm a damned fool , that 's all . What business had I ? " " No , no . You see , you 've been honest . And I  --  well , not very . What we think is being honest and fair is n't really . " " It 's my fault . You have n't given me ? " " Have n't I ? Maybe I would n't admit it to myself . " " Then you ? " His voice sounded incredulous , but he strode across the room to her . He took both her hands , holding them tight . " I 've needed you , Pat  --  for so long  --  and trying to deny ? " " Those words ! " she cried fervently before he took her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lips against hers . It can not be wrong , she thought desperately . For at last again she was a deep necessity to someone . Now she could admit this need of her own . And now night could not come quickly enough .  | CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN FoR several weeks Alan had been besieged by Stevenson at the office to come out and have dinner with him and Mary . Alan had accepted , but only the other day had Steve set a definite date . And then yesterday he had come in and asked , a bit awkwardly , " I do n't know whether I mentioned it or not , chief , but we  --  wo n't you bring Mrs. Reed along , too ? We 'd like to have her . " Alan had explained that he was very sorry , but Pat could not come . He had thought Steve looked rather relieved , but he had merely found it funny that they both should share the same reaction . He had taken every occasion to be away from home during the last month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end and he thought about it as little as possible , because when he did , he wanted to curse himself as every sort of a damned fool . If Pat had shown any indication that she was hurt or angry  --  but she seemed more blithe than ever , and almost too damned preoccupied . Perhaps his old trouble of being blunt had got him into deep water again . But once the words had been said  --  well , they would live through it , and perhaps be the wiser . His anger on that maddening day had long since vanished . But with it something else had gone out of him , some sort  | of confidence in Pat and in all Chicago . He felt empty , and he did n't care . It was with a definite feeling of relief that he left the office this Thursday evening with Stevenson and drove him through the west-bound traffic to the little suburb . Steve was a pretty good guy , after all , and once out of the office he dropped the " chief . " Alan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . One reason he had accepted this invitation was that he wanted somehow to instill a little courage into Steve , and get him into the frame of mind of managing details for himself . Of course there was Walters , the new office manager , a top-notch man , but he 'd like to see Steve take the job away from this interloper that George had forced on them . The first thing he knew they were reminiscing about old days at Arabian Nights Products , until Alan forgot all his own pressing troubles and began to think he had underestimated Steve in the office . " This is our house , " Steve indicated . They drew up before a pleasant little bungalow with its scrap of yard in front and its window boxes full of petunias . Not until then did Alan really consider that he was about to meet an old girl . A girl with whom he had been on most intimate terms , certainly without Steve 's knowledge . His life , curling back on itself . . . The woman who had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same Mary Buchanan he had known in Columbus seven years ago . Her hair , which had been quite blonde then , was heavily streaked with brown , and her body was slightly on the plump side ; she was a mother now and shockingly old-looking for her twenty-nine years .  | She shook his hand with a great show of cordiality , but her face flushed and she called him Mr. Reed . Alan felt funny and embarrassed . " Here , none of this formality , " he said trying to laugh and be natural . All of a sudden he felt remote from these people and out of place , and ashamed that everything looked cheap to him : the little cotton dress she had put on for him , and her black shoes on this summer 's day . It was not so much that he could hardly believe he had ever succumbed to this girl , as that she appeared a total stranger to his eyes . She was paying no attention to what he was saying , but was staring past him at her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alan 's wife could n't come , dear , " Steve said with that same apologetic tone he used at the office . Alan could see her eyes narrow almost in hatred . Why , he had told Steve yesterday . . . . And then he realized Steve must not have reported to her , and that she was affronted and insulted . " Pat could n't come , " he interposed hastily . " She had to go to a  --  a committee meeting , you see . She wanted me to tell you how very sorry she was , " he lied . " Oh , that 's all right  --  Alan , " she smiled at him . " Only , Steve did n't tell me ? " " It was my fault . I said maybe she could come at the last minute , " Alan lied again , knowing that Steve would thank him . The house reminded him of some other place ; for a minute , as they ushered him in and took his hat and urged him to take the wicker chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course ! This was the Buchanan house , all over again . A shade better , it bore a faint resemblance that was not in any piece of furniture and certainly not in the fresh ruffled cur-  | tains , nor the radio , which was modern and streamlined and not the hideous adaptation of a period style  --  he so well remembered back in Columbus . He began to feel at ease once Mary had excused herself to go tend to the dinner and Steve had invited him to take off his coat , and brought out a glass jug with a little handle at its neck . It was California wine , the kind Alan had seen so often in the drugstores and wondered who ever bought it . " This stuff 's not bad , " Steve commented , handing him a big tumblerful . And it really was n't , except that on a hot night it was going to make him sweat like the very devil . , Mary came back from the kitchen , this time with a clean apron on , and told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except that Steve did n't like hard liquor , and the doctor said it was n't good for him . " This wine 's all right , Mary , " Steve told her irritably , and Alan quickly added his praise . " I 'm awfully sorry Mrs. Reed did n't come , I 've got the nicest dinner , " Mary said . She began to unbend as she drank the wine . When he asked her about her mother , she said casually she was all right , and passed on to what a nice summer it had been . " And the best orchestras in town , do n't you think ? " she said in a funny sort of precise way as if she were talking about an exhibit of paintings or a collection of antiques . " Steve and I were at the Edgewater Beach only the other evening . " She made the transition with every effort of a casual statement . " It was our anniversary and I thought perhaps ? " Steve began . " We thought we might see you and Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him .  | " We did go there once this summer . But that was the first time in years . We do n't often ? " Alan apologized . " Oh , I suppose not , I imagine you 're usually at the country clubs , are n't you ? I see your names so frequently in the papers . And Mrs. ? your wife 's picture . She 's so pretty , I do wish I could meet her . . . . Steve sometimes plays golf now but without a car it 's so hard ? " " Mary , the baby 's crying , " Steve interrupted . He poured out some more wine for Alan . She brought the baby in , sucking on its bottle , and wanted Alan to hold it , but he looked so dismayed they both laughed at him , and he felt better . It was a cute little tike . " I suppose it looks like one of you , but I would n't know , I 'm not much of a hand , " he said frankly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steve , Roger looks exactly like someone we know ? " " Aw , Mary ? " " ? and who do you think I say ? Yes , sir , Alan Reed ! " She looked Alan straight in the eyes ; she still had that coy expression . He felt his face growing red and when he laughed he did n't do a very good job of it . But at that moment Mary had to fly to the kitchen , leaving Steve to hold the baby and Alan to pour more wine for everybody . " Mary 's a great gal , she 's always kidding people , " Steve said , jiggling the baby up and down on his knee so that it finally gave up trying to suck on its nipple and began to howl . There were several moments of confusion after that until Mary came to take the child away . She would bring in the salad or some plates and put them on the dining-room table and have a sip of wine and then go back to the kitchen .  | By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all very hot but rather high . Alan was so full of wine that he did n't believe he could do justice to the fried thicken and sweet potatoes with marshmallows on top and the peas and carrots and macaroni and pineapple fritters and the poisonous-looking beet and grapefruit salad , but Mary kept insisting he take some of everything and he had hardly begun before Steve was telling him to pass his plate again . " Do n't hold back , fella , " he kept insisting , and laughing loudly . It was obvious he was n't used to that much wine . " About that west-coast proposition , " he said to Alan in an important tone . " It was a shame that the directors did n't like the idea . Not far-seeing , that 's all . I ca n't understand their ? " " Oh , it would have been marvelous for you and Mrs. Reed to move to California ! " Mary exclaimed . " My aunt ? I do n't know whether you met her in Columbus ? ? used to go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she says she would n't trade it for any place in the world ? " " No , most of them would n't , that 's their trouble , " Alan said . " It would have been a big thing , " Steve declared . Alan shook his head . " I made a grand gesture , but I guess the directors were right . Especially in the face of conditions now . " " But you 'll have some new scheme that will be even better , " Mary prophesied . " I always knew you 'd get ahead , when you were in Columbus , " she added , eying Steve . " I was ' way ahead of myself , " Alan told them . Here these people are thinking what great shucks he was ; it was ironic , it was almost humiliating . " You have to get burnt once in  | a while , " he said meaningfully to Steve . " Make some sort of decision , have the courage to go ahead and try it . Even if you over-reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you 'd never otherwise believe . " Mary said that was what she always told Steve . He had very nearly sold a Steel House to a friend of theirs , but Steve had n't pressed him enough . " He did n't have the money to manage a down payment , I found out , " Steve answered defensively . " Anyway , your bent is the financial end , " Alan said , and both of them puffed out as if he had blown them up like balloons . But that was a cheap trick on his part . Like giving a man a fine new title instead of a raise . He wanted to do something definite for them , to pull them out of this . Obviously Mary was always goading Steve , which seemed the wrong way to inspire him with ambition . If only he could manage , Alan thought , to get them one of the cheaper units of Steel Houses and on that pretext move them out of this suburb to a better place to rear that youngster ... . As he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the angel food cake Mary had baked especially for him  --  because , she said coyly , she remembered how he liked it  --  he asked them how they enjoyed living here in Chicago . " I mean , ever get homesick ? " he asked Mary . Homesick ? With all the movies and places like the Edgewater Beach and  --  and everything ? She was aghast . Undoubtedly the other night she had mentioned was the first time they had been to a hotel to dance in many a long month ; but the hotels were there . Steve was less of an accountant than Alan imagined , too , if they ever went to a movie down-  | town when they could just as well wait and see the same feature more cheaply at their suburban theater . " There 's no future in Columbus , or any small town , " Steve put in scornfully . " I was n't thinking of that , " Alan said . " But in a small city  --  Columbus is n't a hick town , you know that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier to get around and ? " " Oh , we do n't mind not seeing so many people . Now that we have the baby we have our hands full ? " " I 've met some very nice people , " Mary interrupted . " Of course , they 're not the sort you want to know all your life , but then , I tell Steve , when we have a car ? " " She 's always after me to get a car . " Mary changed the subject . " I suppose you went to your college reunion ? " she asked Alan , and he was startled to find out that she knew , probably through the papers , that George Anderson was his roommate and had gone to his tenth . He told her that he himself had not . He remembered how she had announced to her mother and father that he had gone to Princeton  --  the morning after they .. . Steve was saying that college was a great thing . Why , if he had n't decided to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chances were . And probably you 'd be better off , Alan thought . But Steve had ended the migratory part of his life , so far as he was concerned . Chicago was his adopted city , and he and Mary spoke of it with all the affection and excitement that Pat did . Pat : suddenly he remembered the mess his own life was in . What the hell was he going to do ? Here these two were  | talking , quite certain that his life was a success and that he had everything ; and Mary wanting to meet Pat so that she could tell her next-door neighbor , probably , that she had had Society to dinner . At any rate , these people were pretty well satisfied , or thought they were . Yet he could n't help being convinced that they belonged back in Columbus or Youngstown , someplace where they could know everybody and could have a sense of belonging  --  not lost in this damnable city . They were blind  --  dazzled  --  by the vision of high salaries which might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could set them right on that and a few other scores ... . " Let me help with the dishes , " he suggested to Mary , for they had finished at last . Only little pools of melted ice cream and crumbs from the cake remained on their plates . The very idea affronted her and he let Steve lead him into the living room . " Anyway , we 'll take a drive after while , " he promised her . The excited manner in which she accepted suddenly made him realize that , even in America , not every family has a car . As much as he hated driving on a summer night , when everyone and his grandmother were out trying to get cool , he experienced a pleasant sense of anticipation , they would enjoy it so . " That was some dinner , fella , " he told Steve , who was fiddling with the radio . Station after station rumbled loud and fell away , powerfully and clearly . Alan listened attentively as if he were hearing a new invention ; he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the radio . Generally if he turned it on at home it was merely a low accompaniment to people 's chatter or to reading , an irritation every time some announcer broke in.  | " Usually get news here , " Steve was saying , just as Alan heard the broadcaster 's staccato voice bark , " Flash ! " There was a jumble as Steve tuned it in , then the words , the end of a sentence , came through clearly : " ? the Anderson Steel Works . " " Anderson ? ! Listen , Steve , " Alan whispered , and they bent over to catch the next sentence .  | CHAPTER TWENTY-FIGHT EARLIER that afternoon , George had been standing in a long , barren room of the Anderson Steel Works , listening to four men who were seated around a makeshift table  --  the delegation for the SWOC , the Steel Workers ' Organizing Committee . Behind George stood his chief engineer and the plant superintendent . Anyone looking in upon the scene would not have been sure who were the employers and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone of the seven men wore suspenders , although his dark blue shirt might have been that of a workman . He was very familiar with this particular room , with its gray-yellow brick walls and the high windows set in steel casements , chicken wire imbedded in the glass , after the manner of all factory windows . At the end of the room stood some antiquated wooden filing cabinets , on top of which lay a roll of dusty blueprints . On one wall hung an old calendar , portraying a rolling mill from the air , and below , the large red and black numerals for January , 1931 . The cement floor was littered with cigarette butts , some of them old and yellowed now , others freshly ground open , the remaining tobacco spilling out . The room , which was rather a catch-all , was doubly familiar to George because he had received this same delegation here  | many times in the last three months . June , July , now most of August gone : he had developed the habit of thinking while these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the floor , his hands in his hip pockets , his necktie askew . Suddenly he turned on his heel . " All right , Meyer , " he said , addressing the man who had just finished speaking . " I 've heard all that before . We 're getting no place . " " I 'd think you 'd begin to understand , " one of the other men spoke up , " that we mean business . Here 's your last chance before we ask the NLRB to come in ? " " Let them come in , if you 're so sure the men will vote for you , " George snapped . Both sides had barked at each other a great many times now . At first , when he had begun talking to these men , his hostility and his firm conviction that they were outlaws , conspirators , disturbers , agitators and radicals had persuaded him to meet them cautiously . But now he felt they were almost like any other people with whom he might be thrown in contact for long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they were both talking impersonally about some third and fourth parties , as if they were jurors who disagreed . Either there would be a mistrial declared , a hung jury , or one or the other side would be worn down . But not his side , George had long ago resolved . " I 've told you , " he reiterated firmly , " that these conferences are useless . We 'll keep this plant closed as long as you ask for recognition . That 's all you want that you have n't already got . You are n't asking for another thing ? " " You still want to be another Girdler , then ? " Meyer asked him . He was a tough-looking fellow but he also had the best head of the lot . Ten years ago when George had started out by working that summer right in the plant , even more at his  | own wish than father 's , Meyer had been a puddler and eaten his lunch alongside George . Very few men remembered that , or they probably would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word turned his stomach . " We wo n't do any good , calling names , " George said . " You came here today with the idea that I 'd changed my mind . I have not . Let me tell you , what I 've said once and for all is final . You can come back to work when you forget your union . Personally , I think you 'll have better luck taking your chance with me than with some big shot who sends you telegrams and whips you into a lather in some hired hall , once a month . But that 's up to you . It 's up to you whether you want to see your wives and children go without pay . " Meyer stood up , a signal for the others . " Then that 's the last word ? " " God , yes ! " George exclaimed , exasperated beyond words . Meyer looked back at the others and jerked his head . They filed out of the room and a policeman who had been standing outside the door escorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superintendent , a big fellow with a shining bald head , got up from the folding chair he had been sitting on for hours . " Well , I guess you told ' em , " he said proudly . George was mopping his face . He smiled out of one corner of his mouth . " Did n't open the plant though , did it ? " he said to the engineer , who was as thin as the superintendent was fat . Both of them towered above George . " You ca n't tell those bastards anything , " the engineer said . George shrugged . He felt let-down , like a prizefighter who is given the decision by the judges but would rather go on  | and knock his opponent off his feet , feeling he has n't put in his best licks yet . These two beside him were no help . Sometimes he grew just a little contemptuous of them . They saw things the right way , or said they did . But he was the one who had the guts to stand against this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a kind of subdued roar . George looked at the other two . " Probably telling the men the verdict , " the superintendent guessed . Without a word they started for George 's office , where his window gave out onto the yard . Just beyond the iron fence was a great crowd of men , a black , indiscriminate mob , clustered around their delegation . Somebody shouted something in a loud voice . George was thinking fast , an idea growing in his brain . " They 've heard that news before , " he said to his two cohorts , " but they 're taking it differently , you notice ? Sounds like the first days when they walked out . " " Disappointed , probably , " the engineer said . George snapped his fingers . " That 's it ! " he retorted . " That 's just exactly it , Barney . If it were n't for this damned union , they 'd come back . . . . Boys , I 'm going out and talk to ' em . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do any good , they 're hooked . They could n't come to work now if they wanted to . " " No , " George repeated stubbornly , " I 'm going out there . You stay here . " " Hell , we 'll come along with you  --  but you 're crazy . " He started for the entrance door and was about to open it when the superintendent put out his hand and held the door back . " Think this over , boss . "  | " Get out of my way , " George commanded . His mind was intent . " Boss , if I lose my job , I 'm damned if I 'll let you go out and face those hoodlums . It ai n't the same as in the plant . They 're dopes ? " " Get out of my way ! " George cried , and dug his nails into the heavy hand that held the door shut . The superintendent gave a cry and George was out , running down the steps . Down the yard a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . They had seen him now . Someone in the mob cried out , and an angry thunder of voices began gathering . George signaled to the cops standing at the fence gates . They did not seem to understand , and one came running to him . " Unlock those gates and let them all in , " George instructed . " But , Mister Anderson ? " " Do as I say . And let them alone , understand ? " The action seemed to startle the crowd of men into silence . George swung his arms , beckoning them to come in , then cupped his hands to shout for them to close in on the car . He could smell the fumes from factories all around ; the sky was greenish-yellow from the outpourings of smokestacks , the air hung heavy with pungent odors , the sun poured down mercilessly on this black scene , and upon the men , and the car George was standing on . There was a grating sound as the men approached over the cinders . " Come on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all pressed about the car , the heads of those nearest him reaching above the low automobile top that served as his platform . He could see them milling around , and the white shoulders of the superintendent , fighting through with the engineer behind him , until they were beside the car .  | " Listen , men ! " George began . He stood there , his hands in his hip pockets again , feeling a kind of power he had never experienced before . " Men , I 've got a proposition to offer you , " he shouted louder . Someone started to cheer but was immediately hushed up . " Listen to me a minute , " George shouted to them . " I know every one of you wants to go back to work ? " He held up his hand so that there was only a kind of muttering . " Wait a minute . . . . And I want this plant running again . I admit that . But  --  I could tear the whole damned place down . Because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I do with it is my affair . Your delegation tells me I 've got to give in . I tell them I wo n't . And why ? Why the hell do n't I ? What have I got to lose by giving in ? " A cheer went up at this , and George held up his hands , but they did not stop immediately . He waited until they did . " I 'll tell you why . Because I think too much of you men . I do n't want to see you hamstrung . I do n't want to see you tied hand and feet by  --  by a bunch of men who are n't getting you any more wages , any more real advantages of any kind ? by a small group of men who are n't bargaining for anything you have n't got . Now I 'll tell you what I will do . I 'll hire every man of you , I 'll take you in tomorrow , if you 'll come , peacefully , and forget about the SWOC  --  forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and another  --  individual cries . George was holding his hands up again . But they began booing and yelling now , more and more of them , and suddenly , zzing ! ? George heard a missile fly past his head . " Wait a minute  --  listen to me ! " he yelled , but pandemonium was breaking loose . Above the cries and yells he heard one  | man shout , " We 're just a bunch of drones  --  that 's what he thinks of us . Wants to cut off our nuts ? " That damned interview in Tom 's labor paper .... " I did n't say  --  listen ! " he bellowed . The superintendent was pulling at his trouser leg . " Let ' em alone , boss , come on down before something happens ! " he cried above the uproar . " If you want to work , if you 're American enough to ? " George shouted as he saw three policemen running in on the mob . " Let 's settle this ? " he started and just then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees crumpled , and he halfconsciously knew that he was being caught by the superintendent as he slid off the roof of the car ... . When he came to he was lying on top of his flat desk in the office , the superintendent and two policemen looking down upon him . The superintendent 's shirt was torn and had blood on it . The noise that he thought must be in his head took on more clarity until he realized , just as he heard the scream of a squad car siren , that it was the men outside . He tried to get up , but they pushed him back gently . " Do n't start a fight , " he protested doggedly , " do n't let those hunkies wade into ' em with their clubs . Do n't ? " " Okay , boss , everything 's in hand , do n't worry , " the superintendent soothed him . Just then there was a crash as something splintered a window . George fought up to a sitting position . " The hell you say ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cops start a fight with them , I 'll fire you , by God , you 'll be sorry for the day ! " " We 're just bringing up a squad , just in case , " one of the policemen said . " We wo n't start nothin ' , Mister Anderson . " " You go out and tell the captain what I said . "  | " They know , sir . It 'll be all right . " " By Jesus , I will ! " George cried . " You ca n't get my men into a fight . I started this and I 'll ? " " Easy , boss . You 're hurt bad . We 're getting a doctor now . " George put his hand up to his forehead . There was blood II there , all right . He felt dizzy and weak , and his heart was pumping violently . " Barney , " he called . " Get a car and get me out of here . I do n't want to go to any hospital , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " You bet . " " Take me home , hear ? I 'll fire you , too ? " He closed his eyes , and red , jittering lines came across his vision . He tried to open them again but now he could not . Suddenly a twinge of pain convulsed him , starting from the base of his neck , and coursing through his body , so that he had to grit his teeth . He tried to mumble , and then he saw black and lost consciousness again .  | CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE " YOU 'D better ' phone Lydia now , " Tom told Pat for the fourth time . For answer , she took up his glass of beer and sipped it . She had stopped drinking , but Tom had gone out to the kitchen for another bottle . " Pat ! " Tom spoke sharply . What the devil had come over her ? He could n't stand this much longer . " If you do n't ' phone ? " he said more gently , persuasively . Her gaze was far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said very slowly , as if it were an effort for her to speak , " maybe if I waited to ' phone until the last minute ? " " But you 're not going over there . We 're staying here , together . " He thought he was going to burst inside . Suddenly he could stand it no longer and reached down , taking her by her arms and shaking her . She put up her hands to his , entwining them , trying to make him stop . Then she relaxed them as he bent forward and began to kiss her . " Wait , wait ! " she murmured . But she clung to him , finally whispering , " I know , I know . Do n't speak , Tommy . " Softly she ran her fingers through his hair , feeling it and then his wide , thin shoulders and the bowed muscles of his back . She felt as if she were floating . . . . He broke away from her . " Pat , " he said , gently again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightened , all over again . " It 's still early , " she said . Suddenly they heard the telephone ringing . They remained rigid , not making a move . As if , were they not to utter a sound , it would stop . But it rang on , insistently . " Do n't go , " Tom begged her . " No , I 'd better , " she said , and ran into the hall . He could hear the instrument still buzzing after she had taken it off the cradle . " Yes ? " he heard her voice say . Then , " Oh , hello .... What ? Oh , no ! My dear ! Yes , yes , of course , I will . Right away . In just a minute .... Good-by . " He came out into the hall to meet her . She looked pale . " The most awful thing 's happened . That was Lydia . They 're bringing George home unconscious . He was stoned by the men at his plant .... I never heard her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still unable to believe . " She sounded  --  sort of hysterical , as if .... I 'll have to go . " Then she looked at Tom and with a little cry , ran to him and put her arms about him . " Oh , I 've been so lonely , lonely ! " she burst forth . Everything that she had felt in the last month was released in that one exclamation . He held her close , calming her . " You do n't know what it 's been for me , " he finally managed to say . " I thought I was steel-clad , but . . . Seeing you like this and not being really near you  --  it 's been plain hell ! Darling , we 've got to ? " " Yes , yes ! When , we come back , " she promised . " We 'll just stay for a minute . I have to , you understand , dear . " He nodded , letting her go . " Do you want me to come along ? "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  funny ? " " I 'd have to call a cab if you did n't take me , " she replied sensibly . When they drove up to the door of the house Lydia and George had rented for the summer , a maid was waiting for them . " You 're to go right upstairs , Mrs. Reed , " she said in a hushed tone that made Pat catch her breath . She began running up the stairs , her tennis shoes making little squeaking noises on the polished steps , not even conscious that Tom was following her . The door at the head of the stairs was slightly ajar and she could see only Lydia , standing at the foot of a bed , her eyes staring , her handkerchief held in a tight little wad at her mouth . Pat pushed the door open and went in . She did not catch sight of George or the doctor immediately because Lydia ran forward , throwing her arms around her . Then she saw George . He was lying on top of the coverlet , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hair at the temple , and a deep streak ran down over his cheek , and there were dark brown stains on his shirt . Pat felt her chin quiver . Then something happened to her . She went cold all over , yet her body seemed to stiffen so that the weight of Lydia 's body against her was nothing at all to bear . The doctor had looked around ; he was Dr. Towbridge , whom everyone in the village called . " If you 'll take Lydia out of here , Patricia , " he said quietly . Tom started to help but Pat shook her head . Somehow , she felt as if she could do all of this better by herself . She got
