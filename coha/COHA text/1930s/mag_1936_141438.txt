That the U. S. had a great new gold vein in its lap was the fond hope of the West last week. * Whatever it was , the Jumbo Mine , in the Awakening district of Nevada 's Slumbering Hills made headlines from San Francisco to Manhattan . Discoverers were two old prospectors , " Red " Staggs and Clyde Taylor , who spied the yellow flecks on the frozen ground of this sagebrush desert on Jan. 29 , 1935 . Three months later , in need of cash , they sold their find to George Austin , grizzled , 63-year-old keeper of the general store , hotel and filling station at Jungo , a tiny hamlet on the Western Pacific R. R. , 36 miles southwest of Jumbo Mine . Price was $10,000 , $500 down . <P> George Austin could not find a Nevada mining man to put up the $500 cash for a third interest and he himself did not want to mortgage the house he owned in Reno . Finally he borrowed $1,000 without security from a generous friend , made the down payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ore , trekked them out by packhorse and sent them to the San Francisco Mint . They were worth $84.45 . His ore assayed at the bonanza rate of $1,495 gold and 20 oz. of silver per ton . If the Jumbo vein held out , George Austin was a very rich man . <P> For a while he kept the secret in the family . His brother Jesse staked two claims adjoining Jumbo on the north . George 's two sons , Kenneth , 24 , University of Nevada graduate , and Wilfred , 20 , University of Nevada sophomore , staked claims on the remaining sides of Jumbo . The four thereupon signed a 50-year agreement not to sell their claims . <P> Starting first on the original strike , they dug shallow shafts and open cuts over an area 800 ft. by 400 ft. , found gold wherever they dug . Working with a primitive " coffee grinder " mill , they began turning out $500 worth of gold a day , paid off the two prospectors within a year and up to last week had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dazzling story of the Jumbo strike spread across the country on the authority of no less a mining expert than Herbert Hoover . <P> The country 's only living ex-President and a San Francisco oilman named R. W. Hanna visited Jumbo last fortnight , " purely out of geological curiosity . " Much impressed , Mr. Hoover advised Austin to hold on to Jumbo . When Austin offered to pay for this advice , Mr. Hoover told him : " That kind of advice is free . " Oilman Hanna , however , bought five claims in the Slumbering Hills around Jumbo . <P> Last week Jungo citizens were telling all-comers of a cash offer made by Mr. Hoover ; of $1,000,000 for a half-interest offered by John J. Raskob , who arrived at s Jungo in a private railroad car ; of $3 , - ' 500,000 offered by Consolidated Goldfields of South Africa , Ltd . Against these fabulous bids were two authentic offers of $250,000 cash . In addition to Mr. Hanna 's claims , Nevada 's one U. S. Representative James G. Scrugham ( pronounced " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevada 's Engineering College , was so im-pressed by Jumbo that he had bought an option on a nearby claim and was camping in the neighborhood .
