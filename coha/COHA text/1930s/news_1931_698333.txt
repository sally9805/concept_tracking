txt Letters to the Editor Bronx Annexed in 1895 . To the Editor of The New York Times : There appeared in THE TIMES an editorial , " Old and New Cities , " containing the statement , " But the city of 1895 was confined to Manhattan Island . " Annexation of the mainland to New York City started in the 1870s and ended in 1895 , when the territory east of the Bronx River was annexed , giving the City of New York , prior to 1898 , an area of about sixty-six square miles . IRVING LEVENE . New . York , Dec. 1 , 1931 . MEASURES FOR RELIEF . Unemployed Can not Continue to Live on Charity . To the Editor of The New York Times : One hears appeals for charity from all sides . There is no doubt that the organizations dispensing charity have done much good . But the question arises : How long can people keep on depending on charity for their existence ? Something must be done to eliminate as far as possible the need for people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating a program that will give employment to all . Though most people are inclined to give to charity , there is a limit to their endurance . For those who receive charity , that is not their salvation . What they want is . an honest opportunity to earn their own livelihood . My program for relief for my city would be as follows : 1 . The Creation of a uniform sixhour day for labor . 2 . No less than $5 a day for skilled labor . 3 . The elimination of married women as employes where an investigation reveals that they can be supported by their husbands . 4 . The restoration of two men on all trolley cars and of one man for each subway car . 5 . The ? e-employing of musicians for the entertainment and enjoyment of all theatre patrons . 6 . A luxury tax on all those articles deemed to be luxuries . 7 . An increased tax on incomes in the higher brackets . 8 . An increased inheritance tax . 9 . A 10 per cent decrease of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . 10 . A greater public improvement construction program to create more work for labor . 11 . The creation of a loan fund by the municipal government at a very low rate of interest to be paid back at short intervals for the use of property owners to be used exclusively for the improvement of their homes . IRVING R. SUGARMAN . " Brooklyn , Dec. 1 , 1931 . CARE OF THE TEETH . Slogan " A Clean Tooth Can not Decay " Still Holds Good . To the Editor of The New York Times : When one of the doctors made the statement at the joint meeting of physicians and dentists in the Hotel Pennsylvania that " a clean tooth can decay " he could not have realized that this has not been proved to he true . Modern research has not shown that decay can take place without bacteria being present . Erosion can occur on a clean tooth , but decay never . It was Dr. J. Leon Williams who coined the slogan " A clean tooth can not decay , " and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adoption of this slogan and its wide publicity have done more to arouse the interest of the public to the importance of mouth health than can be estimated or fully appreciated . It has been this aroused interest in mouth health which has led wealthy philanthropists to establish dental clinics for children in Boston , Rochester , London , New York and other cities . No tooth is clean which harbors bacteria and food debris within its enamel surface , and every tooth having small openings , known as enamel defects or flaws , harbor billions of bacteria which can not be disturbed by brushing . Such teeth are not clean , no matter how clean they may look , and such teeth decay . It would be wise and of far greater value to teach the public , particularly parents , that the child 's teeth need very early attention so that preventive dentistry may be done and these small openings closed and the bacteria kept out . Then it will not be difficult to keep such teeth clean , and the slogan will still be true . THADDEUS P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . NO RECOVERY BY FIAT . We Shall Have to Work Our Own Way Out of Depression . To the Editor of The 2s'eto York Times : Pollyanna preachments are popular just now and have been for two years . But self-deception butters no parsnips . Ignotum pro magnifico ; concealment magnifies fears  --  why not face the truth ? The plight in which this nation now finds itself is due primarily to the fact that in the World War the so-called civilized countries burned up or mortgaged a large share of the wealth that mankind had accumulated since the Dark Ages . And thereafter , led on by the mirage of an inflated price level , they continued the orgy of spending and debtcont  --  acting as if nothing untoward had happened . Prosperity is based on thrift , and the very meaning of that word has been all but forgotten . When a relatively important portion of the race has learned its lesson and descended for an indefinite period to-a lower standard of living , and by hard work and self-denial again amassed a surplus , then , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The whole world is very much in the posture of a man who has gone on a spree with cards , drink and the devil , during which he has blown in all his savings and pledged his home for more than it is worth . It will take him years to retrieve his lapse , even if his moral disintegration will admit of it . Meantime , his purchasing power Is at a minimum . After such a world-wide rake 's progress , repentance and rehabilitation must be slow and tedious , and there will be pitfalls . Wages must be readjusted . Tariff walls must come down or at least be lowered . Water will be squeezed out of capitalizations based on war profits . No one will take his medicine willingly or without a wry face . Every lawmaking body . wil be besieged with all sorts of nostrums intended to enable men ' still to possess cakes that they have long since eaten . After 1873 , the worst year was 1877 . Following 1893 , liquidation was not wholly completed for five years at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that there was a ready market abroad for all that this nation could produce , except for a brief interval . What is not the case at present . In the ' 90s , first-class artisans worked for $2 per ten-hour day and retail . prices were in keeping . It is interesting to recall the sequence of events . Grain sown in Nebraska the Fall of 1893 in some cases did not germinate until the Spring of 1895 , owing to drought . In those days corn from Western farms sold for 10 cents a ? bushel and was burned for fuel ; eggs brought 3 cents a dozen . In 1895 wheat dropped on the Chicago Board of Trade to 487/s cents , and 1896 brought the silver craze . But that drought was negligible in comparison with that of 1930 , and the abuse of credit in the early ' 70s and ' 90s was child 's play compared to that which culminated in 1929 , Nor had there been , even in 1861-65 or ever in recorded history , such appalling waste of capital through war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to return to the levels of the ' 90s ; butt Bradstreet 's index number , which during those years reached a minimum of $6 plus , is now down to $8 plus ( $20 plus in 1920 ) , and certainly this tremendous drop is not reflected extensively in what . consumers are paying for many articles to storekeepers wedded to 300 per cent . And the $10-a-day men who were getting $3 to $4 prior to 1914 are showing no disposition to relinquish their cars and six-room modern homes . And it is a popular doctrine nowadays that recovery can he promoted not by prudence and economy but rather through foster . ing the very spendthriftiness that has brought the worldjo its present pass . It can , in short , hardly be said that liquidation has made a beginning , except on the stock market and in respect of a few basic food products and raw materials . Mankind , in the mass , is seldom Capable o arriving at just conclusions by exercise of reason , and an inferiority complex and envy and distrust of superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among whom , indeed , there is often little consensus of opinion . It follows that legislative bodies tend increasingly to embrace few men of outstanding character and ability and results are what might be expected . . No fountain rises higher than its source . We choose our representatives and must abide the event . What saith Poor Richard ? " Experience keeps a dear school , and fools will learn in no other . " There are no short-cuts to recovery from depressions . Character building is not achieved by fiat . W. D. SHEPPARD . Denver , Col. , Nov. 23 , 1931 . Tickets Instead of Money . To the Editor of The New York Times : May I make the following suggest tion regarding the use of tickets now available through the A. I. C. P. for persons who solicit alms or relief in , New York streets ? These tickets arc used only to refer men or women to the Central Registry Bureau at South Ferry , which seems a long way for a hungry person to go . Would it not be possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books should contain the addresses of food kitchens and lodging houses in various parts ' of the city , and the persons receiving the tickets could easily be directed to the nearest place . The tickets as now being used do not serve for immediate relief and cause much extra travel on the part of the recipient . Undoubtedly , the Emergency Work Bureau could realize further revenue through these book tickets , as I personally feel that many persons , such as myself , would be only too glad to buy them . BARBARA S. ADLER , New York , Dec. 4 , 1931 . A Correction . To the Editor of The New York Times : In a TIMES editorial of yesterday , Dec. 2 , I find the following statement : " Some time ago Senator Borah announced that the bill to bring the United States into the World Court would not be so much as called up or mentioned during the coming session . If nobody would forbid it , he would , " May I be permitted to say that the writer of this editorial has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have entertained no such view . I have assumes : all along that as soon as pressing domestic matters were out of the way , the question of the World Court would he taken up and disposed of . I can assure you that that is entirely agreeable to me . I am sure you will be glad to make this correction . WILLIAM E. BORAH . Washington , Dec. 3 , 1931 . Uniformity Lacking . To the Editor of The New York Times : A photograph taken at Governors Island recently and published in THE NEW YORK TIMES pictures Major Gen. Hanson E. Ely , a real soldier of the old school , correctly executing the hand salute , while standing behind him we see three officers giving an assortment of salutes and wearing'fhree different types of overcoats . The only thing uniform about these three officers is their caps . I wonder what the members of the Sixteenth Infantry thought as they marched past in review and executed the command " Eyes ? ight ! " To the average civilian this means nothing , but to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MILES O'REILLY . Brotglyn , Dec. 1 , 1931 , EXPLAINING A SURPLUS . But Working Capital Is a Better Guide to Security Holders . To the Editor of The New York Times : A very interesting letter recently appeared in THE TIMES , " Why Is a Surplus ? " written by Robert Peele . I am sure that this is a subject of wide interest , particularly in view of some of the points raised by Mr. Peele . Surplus is commonly understood to be the difference between total assets and total liabilities . In no sense should it be looked upon as representing so many dollars in the bank or marketable securities in the treasury of the company . To get a true idea of the liquid position of any company it is necessary to look at the working capital , which is the difference between current assets and current liabilities . This factor is of outstanding importance today , when so many of our corporations are finding it necessary to draw on their surplus in order to maintain or at least pay some dividends . It might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a bank with a statement receives a line of credit based on the ratio of current assets to current liabilities . Fixed assets , each as property , machinery , &c.,; are rarely weighed in determining the ' his of credit to be extended . The building up of railroad surpluses is restricted by the transportation act of 1920 . This act does not permit the railroads to earn more than 6 per cent on a fair valuation of their property , with the result that it has placed them in a most disadvantageous position  --  the reason being that the railroads can not accumulate an adequate surplus In good years to provide a reserve on which to draw when business is lean . The question that M ? . Peele has raised is an important one . It will have good results if security holders pay more attention to the working capital of companies , other than railroads and public utilities , in which they are interested and less to thc mere size of the surplus which is represented so frequently by fixed ? assets . EDWIN J. SCHLESINGER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Factor . To the Editor of The Nett , York Times : Under the heading " More Rural Votes Needed " Lafayette B. Gleason attempts to show in a letter to THE TIMES that urban voters in New York State are not under-represented in Congress under the present apportionment . His argument : is fallacious because his figures ta he account of voters only . and he makes no mention of the fact that Congressional apportionment is based under the Constitution on population , not votes . The huge alien popslation in this city accounts for the small votirn strength in some of the city districts .. Under the State Constitution , aliens are not counted in legislative apportionment , which gives the up-State Republicans a big edge in elections , to say nothing of the rotten-borough system that gives each county except Hamilton one Assemblyman regardless of either population or votes . Mr. Gleason is the typical Republican apologist  --  making no mention of the vital point in presenting a set of doctored statistics . ORVILLE WELSH . New York , Nov , 26 , 1931 . Unique Employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Did you ever open the door of an employment agency and find yourself standing in a garden where a bird sang ? Such was my experience this morning as I went the rounds of the agencies . Imagine going up in the elevator of a tall building , opening a door and finding a canary in a cage singing so sweetly I thought I was dreaming . Near by hung sketches of gardens and beautiful Spring scenes , and as I looked from one to the other something inside of me sang also in unison with the bird . For several moments I stood listening . Then I thought of Shelley 's 0 wind , If Winter comes , can Spring he far behind ? Suddenly a voice broke the magic spell . Good gracious ! I had forgotten I was hunting for a job . R. KAPLAN . Brooklyn , Nov. 30 , 1931 . Employment by Radio . To the Editor of The New York Times : The value of the radio , especially in a depression or a crisis , was again demonstrated when Director Rybicki of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have jobs by applying . As a radio enthusiast and engineer , I wish to commend Mr. Rybicki for his use of the radio as a contact between the jobless and the job . He is , I believe the first to use the radio for this purpose , and I heard him tell a group of radio editors that his broadcast last Winter for snow cleaners resulted in 7,500 jobs . I see in the use of the air a better distribution of labor in the possibility of preventing a glutted labor market in one section and a dearth of labor in another . ARTHUR TOMPKINSON . New York , Nov. 25 , 1931 . Alien Crews on American Ships . To the Editor of The New York Times : I have for some time past been in a position to notice that on many of the steamers owned by North American companies the crews consist mainly of Chinese stewards , deckhands , &c.; It has occurred to me that during these hard times it would be better for such companies to help the unemployment situation in this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , Nov. 30 , 1931. -
