txt // one David Leighton , who had been trained in England and was equally versed in surgery and pharmaceutics . To him he sent his prescriptions to be filled . This , too , was an innovation , and moreover an innovation which met with great opposition on the part of physicians , since it was a question of hard cash . It was from their medicines that physicians frequently derived the greatest part of their income . However , this was exactly what seemed to Morgan unbefitting a physician . It led , so ran his argument , to a lack of appreciation for the physician 's service . The patient , who is charged a definite fee for his treatment , is not aware what portion of the sum is the cost of the drugs and how much is in payment of medical advice . He is only too much inclined to assume that the expense lies primarily in the cost of the medicine . And besides , Morgan goes on , is it not better to have the prescriptions filled by a skilled apothecary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not the physician but his pupils who prepared the prescriptions . Morgan was also busy organizing in other directions . In the same year that the faculty was established , in 1765 , he initiated a medical society , which a few years later merged into the American Philosophical Society , in the organization of which he took a leading part ; as in that of the College of Physicians in 1787 , a medical academy in the manner of the London and Edinburgh colleges . Now came the Revolution and the war with England . In 1775 Morgan was appointed by Congress General Director of Military Hospitals and Physician-in-Chief of the Army . A wide new field was opened to his gift for organization , a field full of thorns , however . The army was very much disorganized ; the sanitary division especially so . Morgan went forward without fear or favor , fighting abuses wherever he found them . But he ran his head against a stone wall . It is not easy to put over reforms in education ; it is still more // difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most impossible thing of all is to attempt to meddle with army institutions ; especially for an outsider . Intrigues arose against Morgan , which caused his downfall within a year . He was dismissed by Congress , which appointed as his successor his colleague and rival , Shippen . Morgan retired full of resentment , took up his pen and wrote a violent pamphlet in his own defense . Back in Philadelphia , Morgan resumed his interrupted practice . Since 1773 he had been attached as physician to the hospital where he had once worked as Redman 's pupil and had mixed drugs in the pharmacy . But here too , evidently , he became involved in dissensions . He resigned in 1783 . He withdrew more and more into retirement and died in October , 1789 . ( Fig. 5 ) ( Benjamin Rush ( 1745 ? 1813 ) His successor in the chair of Practical and Theoretical Medicine was Benjamin Rush . ( Fig. 6 ) The faculty had become deeply involved in the revolutionary struggle . Students and instructors were at the front . More unfortunately still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered too conservative ; and one day in the year 1779 it was incontinently suppressed , a new university , the University of the State of Pennsylvania , being set up in its place . A senseless proceeding this ; the closing of the University of Paris during the French Revolution was a different matter , putting an end to what was already rigid under the accumulated tradition of centuries . Here , on the contrary , was a young institution , in its first stages of tentative growth , to which violence would not bring freedom , but destruction . The new university made every effort to induce the staff of the former college to join its ranks . It met with no great success and those professors who gradually accepted the call , did so only with the purpose of keeping alive the idea of a medical school . // The college , however , had determined friends , with Benjamin Franklin at their head . In 1783 , thanks to their exertions , its suppression was annulled . The professors returned in a body . Philadelphia now found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competing universities , each with its own medical faculty . Eventually common sense got the upper hand . In 1791 , after the excitement of war had subsided , the two universities were merged into the University of Pennsylvania , still one of the leading universities of the country . Both corps of professors were taken over ; and in this way a most notable faculty was brought together . Shippen was again made Professor of Anatomy and Obstetrics , with Caspar Wistar , a prominent anatomist , as associate ; Adam Kuhn assumed the teaching of theory and practice ; and Rush became Professor of Institutions and of Clinical Medicine . Chemistry was represented by James Hutchinson ; materia medica and pharmaceutics by Samuel P. Griffitts ; botany and natural history by Benjamin Smith Barton . For Benjamin Rush this marked the beginning of a new chapter ; one in which all his activities were centered around medicine and which led to his becoming the founder of the American clinic . His previous life had been full of variety . Born of a Quaker family of English descent , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Redman after taking his bachelor 's degree at Princeton ; then , again like Morgan , had gone to Edinburgh where he graduated in 1768 ; and after a study-tour in France he had , four years later than Morgan , returned to Philadelphia , where he was immediately , at the age of 24 , given the chair of Chemistry at the College . He had pursued his studies with fervor . Even as a very young student he had translated the aphorisms of Hippocrates into English . He was one of the first to attend Shippen 's lectures on anatomy , and in 1762 , during a fever epidemic , he kept a detailed diary which later provided him with valuable // material . His objective differed from that of Morgan . He was interested not so much in shaping an outward form for the cience of medicine as in enlarging its scope . He lived the early part of his life in the greatest retirement and would never have been seen walking with a silk umbrella . As he said once , medii ne was his wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his grave where he lay buried , forgetting the world and by it forgotten . Which did not prevent his later taking to himself a corporeal wife and begetting thirteen children . He remained in this retirement only while the fighter in him was still dormant . For his was a fiery heart . The ideals of the Enlightenment burned in him as they did in Franklin . Liberty , the Rights of Man were to him no empty phrases . With Franklin he helped found a Society for the Protection of the Free Negroes , and was made president after Franklin 's death . He suffered from the anomaly that there should be slaves in a country of free citizens . He was the champion of free schools and of religious toleration ; he fought the abuse of alcohol and tobacco , as well as the too free use of profanity . Many of his writings are still very much to the point and deserve to be reprinted and read ; as , for instance , the paper in which he criticizes the senselessness of the penal system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no more doubt of every crime , " he says , " having its cure in moral and physical influence than I have of the efficacy of the Peruvian bark in curing intermittent fever . " Besides his public work he carried on a large practice . When the Revolution came , it found him ready . As a member of the Continental Congress of 1777 he was one of the signers of the Declaration of Inde. pendence . He later became Surgeon-General of the Revolutionary Army . But he soon resigned , having , like Morgan , become entangled in a net of intrigue . He returned to practical medicine , in which as teacher and physician he took an ever-increasing part , // The philosophers of the Enlightenment were of necessity dogmatists . They championed their doctrines with the conviction and zeal of soldiers waging the wars of religion . When these philosophers chanced to be at the same time physicians , their dogmatism might easily reveal itself in their medical beliefs . This was the case with Rush . It is true that for Sydenham , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest admiration . But he himself was the product of Cullen 's school , which was the cradle of neuropathology . Cullen 's philosophical attitude , his tendency towards systematization , could not help making a powerful appeal to a nature such as Rush 's . Another product of Cullen 's school had been John Brown , whose Elementa Medicinae appeared in 1780 and was to bring about a revolution in therapy . The concepts of irritability , of sthenia and asthenia , would naturally capture the enthusiasm of a medical world which was just then beginning to think in physiological terms . In 1793 a fearful epidemic of yellow fever raged in Philadelphia . Rush , who had seen the first cases in August of that year , drew attention to the impending danger , and was laughed at for his concern . The contagion spread at a terrific rate , and for weeks panic possessed the town . A graphic account written by the publisher and bookseller Matthew Carey describes scenes which bring to our minds Boccaccio 's pictures of the plague in Florence . Those who could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents , but there was no town that would shelter the fugitives . Mad rumors were afloat as to means of protecting oneself . Women and children went about with huge cigars in their mouths ; people chewed garlic all day long or merely kept some in their pockets or their shoes . In many houses gun-powder , tobacco or alum were constantly kept burning , or vinegar was sprinkled at intervals . People did not dare to walk along the walls of houses but would run down the // middle of the street to avoid poisonous exhalations . Regardless of class the dead were buried without even the simplest funeral service . Thousands fell victims to the fever . It is the same old drama of pestilence , which has been replayed so often all over the world . As is always the case , there were shown in this extremity examples of great heroism . The physicians did whatever was humanly possible , Benjamin Rush above all others . He saw close relatives succumb to the infection ; was himself taken sick ; but he would not give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a hundred to a hundred and twenty-five patients a day . A method of treatment was sought . Rush , too , had the problem in his mind and found his answer in following the principles laid down by Brown . The disease seemed to him to be a sthenic condition . He endeavored to remove the causes of excessive stimulation by means of blood-letting , cold air , cold drinks , restricted diet , and cold-water applications . The results convinced him of the correctness of his premises . The sick crowded to his door . The epidemic died down . Rush , however , remained a convinced adherent of the Brunonian theories ; he became their propagator . With the same passion with which he had championed social reforms , he now threw himself into the fight for medical ideals . For the battle was a serious one . He was violently attacked on account of his drastic remedies . Profuse bleedings and large doses of calomel were his main reliance . He subjected himself to further attacks by ascribing the ultimate responsibility for the epidemic to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wielded a facile pen ; and fierce polemics were the result . The fight around the Brunonian theories was ended early in the nineteenth century , when the Paris clinical school showed the way out . Rush is the child of the eighteenth century Enlightenment ; he is essentially a philosopher . His services to medicine // are not to be sought in his theories , which were conditioned by his period and died with it . But he was not alone a philosopher and a theorist ; he was a great physician and in the hands of a great physician all theories achieve results , since he will never be unbendingly dogmatic in his practice but , faithful to his professional intuition , will put aside his theories when the case demands it . Rush himself has often discarded old beliefs for new and has never hesitated to admit it . His observations on cholera infantum , on the relations between rheumatism and diseases of the teeth were anything but dogmatic and very far in advance of their time . He was also a great teacher . Thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him how to observe , and to reason from a clinical standpoint . However , his greatest services lie probably in the field of social medicine . From 1783 on , he was physician at the Penn-sylvania Hospital . During the thirty years in which he held this position , the mentally ill were his greatest concern . He saw to it that there was improvement in their living conditions and in the care of the sick ; that adequate bathing facilities were provided to keep them decently clean ; and that troublesome visitors were kept away . But above all he sought to cure mental illnesses . " We assume , " he says in a letter , " that insanity has its seat in the mind . And nevertheless we attempt with remark-able inconsistency to cure it by physical methods . The disease affects the body and mind alike and can be cured only by methods which reach both . " Work and diversion seemed to him remedies for mental illnesses . In this regard he was a pioneer in occupational therapy . It goes without saying that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rush was among its supporters . And finally , he is a part of the great hygienic movement which belongs to the medical history of the Enlightenment . He had seen at first hand the fearful effects of yellow fever and had // reached the conclusion that such epidemics could be warded off as men had learned to ward off lightning . He said once , prophetically , " The time will come when courts of justice will punish cities and villages if they allow the sources of bilious and malignant fever to persist in their midst . " Rush has been called the American Sydenham . The designation is unfortunate . Rush and Sydenham belong to quite different categories . Rush , too , was of course a clinician , but he was beyond that a man of the Enlightenment , embodying its highest ideals . John Morgan and Benjamin Rush are merely two men singled out of a group of prominent physicians ; but to these two Philadelphia first of all owes the fact that , in the field of medicine , it became a model to the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 1830 ) The next scene is laid in Kentucky on a farm . After the peace of Paris , settlers from Virginia had begun to push westward over the mountains and to clear the forests . At first there were very few ; after the Revolution they came in greater numbers . Three counties were founded which , united into one state , Kentucky , were taken into the Union in 1792 . On this Kentucky farm , later known as Motley 's Glen , Thomas Crawford led the life of a pioneer . His wife , Jane Todd Crawford , thought herself pregnant . She knew the symptoms . She had already borne five children . Her body swelled . Her time drew near . But she felt no life stirring within her . Her body grew bigger and bigger . Something was wrong . A neighboring doctor was called in ; then a second . Neither had any advice to give , and they suggested sending sixty miles away for Ephraim McDowell , so that he might deliver her . He was known as a good surgeon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments and medicines in his saddle-bags , as was the habit of pioneer-doctors . He arrived // December 13 , 1809 . He made an examination , and soon found that this was no pregnancy , but a tumor . What was to be done ? There were no hospitals in that region , no professors whose counsel could be sought . Here everyone was thrown on his own resources . But the resolution with which the pioneers had faced Indians and wilderness was alive in their physicians as well ; theirs was the same initiative , the same practical good sense . McDowell came to the conclusion that nothing short of an operation , the removal of the tumor with a knife , would be of any use . It was an unheard-of risk to take . No such operation had ever been carried out . The dressing of wounds , the care of broken bones and sprains , amputations , stones , ruptures , tracheotomies : these were at that time the whole scope of surgery . A serious abdominal surgery did not exist . He talked quite frankly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger she was running ; explained to her that this was an experiment and asked whether she were willing to submit herself to it . She was willing . The wives of pioneers were brave women . They shrank from no exertion . They did not even dread Indians . How could a pioneer 's wife get along with such a growth in her body ? She would be no good to anyone . Yes , she would let herself be operated upon . McDowell asked her to go with him to his house in Danville . She climbed up on the horse . It was the middle of winter . The tumor rested on the pommel . The journey had to be slow and lasted several days . Then came the great moment . The patient lay on the table . A nephew of McDowell 's who had studied in Philadelphia and a young pupil assisted at the operation . The abdominal cavity was laid wide open . The patient gritted her teeth . There appeared a large pedunculated cystic tumor of one ovary . The tube was ligated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the meantime the patient recited psalms . It lasted twentyfive minutes ; then it was over . // Coming into the room five days later , McDowell found the patient making her own bed . On the twenty-fifth day she drove home . She lived thirty-one years longer . That is the whole story . But here we have the first ovariotomy . The pioneer spirit had won a new field for surgery . McDowell was thirteen years old when he came to Kentucky from Virginia . His father , of Scotch descent , was active in the local administration . His son was sent to study with a Dr. Humphrey in Staunton , Virginia . After this , in 1793 , he went to Edinburgh , where he spent one year . He did not graduate . His chief interest was in surgery , and he attended the lectures which were given outside of the University by John Bell . In 1795 he returned to Danville , a town of less than a thousand inhabitants , but at that time the capital of Kentucky . He soon acquired a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second case of ovarian cyst ; in 1816 upon a third case . These operations were again successful . It occurred to him to make his findings public . He described them in a few pages , not in learned jargon , but in simple straightforward words . He was no literary man . The article appeared in a medical magazine published in Philadelphia , the Eclectic Repertory and Analytical Review , Vol . VII , in the year 1817 . He was laughed at . Here was a man from the backwoods , telling tall stories . They tried to show him that he had overshot his mark . But he did not let himself be turned aside . I n 1819 he brought forward two additional cases . This time he was heeded . He found followers , first in America , then in Europe , till gradually his operation became the common heritage of surgery and gynecology . The University of Maryland , in 1827 , conferred on him the honorary degree of doctor of medicine ? his first academic degree . In Danville , where his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pyramid bearing his portrait . His home , a simple frame house , has been preserved , and one can see the // room where the first operation was performed . That is all . A homely story , very moving in its simplicity . Daniel Drake ( 1785-1852 ) The scene is again laid in Kentucky . A block-house , put to-gether with rough logs . The Drake family had moved from New Jersey in 1788 , bringing nothing but their two horses and the load of one wagon . They were simple , uneducated people . Their idea was to cut down trees and to plow the land . But their children should see better things . Daniel was then three years old . He grew up in the woods , in the open air ; and came into an intimate relationship with all natural things . He helped chop down trees and cultivate the soil . There were no schools , but now and then a wandering schoolmaster or preacher passed through the country , was given lodging by the settlers , and remained a while , teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned to guide a pen . An uncle of Daniel 's was the storekeeper of the settlement . He had chosen the better part , earned a pretty income , and was able to send his son to study medicine in Philadelphia . When the cousin came home for the holidays , Daniel would pore over his text-books . He , too , wanted to become a doctor . To be sure , the family had no means of sending him to Philadelphia , but his father had a scheme . On the trip down the Ohio he had become ac-quainted with a Dr. Goforth , who was also making his way west . He had settled first in their neighborhood , but later moved to Cincinnati , the city in Ohio which promised to have the greatest future . At that time , it held less than a thousand inhabitants . This Dr. Goforth , was willing , for $400 compensation , to take young Drake into his home and train him as a physician . By December , 1800 , when Drake was fifteen years old , the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride to town // and knock on his preceptor 's door . The time for learning had arrived . He read all his teacher 's little library : Cheselden 's Anatomy , Haller 's Physiology , the works of Boerhaave and van Swieten . Rush was forbidden , since Goforth had no use for his therapy . But in secret Drake devoured everything by Rush that he could lay his hands on and had no greater wish than to see and hear the author in person . As for the rest , he compounded salves , mixed drugs , and accompanied his teacher on his professional rounds . At the same time he went to school , to learn Latin . He was ambitious , and determined to better himself , and neglected no educational opportunities . After only four years of study , Goforth took Drake into partnership . But Drake wanted more learning . Using his first earnings , and armed with a diploma certifying that he had successfully completed his period of preparation , he made his way to Philadelphia and for five months attended the courses at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lectures . ' ' hen he went back to Cincinnati , later practising for a while in the village where his parents lived . But the field was too limited for him . He returned to Cincinnati again and lived there until 1815 as a distinguished physician and an active member of a young and progressive community . A western practice was no simple matter . The patients as a rule lived great distances apart . There was nothing unusual in a ride of fifteen to twenty miles through darkness and fog ; one needed a good constitution . The fee depended upon the length of the ride ; twenty-five cents a mile , half in cash , half in commodities . Or often nothing at all . Medical supplies were a problem in themselves . Drugs ordered from the East might take five months to arrive . The man who was no good at reckoning and at keeping an eye on his medicine closet soon found himself on the road to ruin . Having grown up in the West , Drake was quick to realize that it was here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na92 American Medicine tion 's future would work itself out . This land , where men of many races and creeds , coming from the most diverse communities , had to face hard labor side by side , must one day be the melting-pot of the nation . What were the conclusions to be drawn from this situation that concerned medicine ? What responsibilities should be assumed by the physician ? With the eye of genius , Drake was the first to see what would be needed . This is his contribution . He foresaw that medicine had two great tasks to perform if the settling of the country was not to be left to develop in an accidental and chaotic fashion . And the first task was the investigation , from the standpoint of health and sanitation , of this spacious breeding-ground for men . And what an enormous breeding-ground was provided by this largest valley ever fashioned by Nature , spreading from the Alleghanies to the Rocky Mountains , from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico , and watered by the Mississippi and its tributaries , great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missouri in the West . " 01 ' Man River , " it was affectionately called ; but it was a capricious master , whose sluggish calm was not to be trusted , who could storm wildly , break down the confining shores and flood the country , bearing all before it and leaving swamps and fever in its wake . The second great task was to insure an adequate supply of competent physicians for the new country , not only for the present , but for the future . The whole idea was that the physician should become an integral part of the coming development , a pioneer by the side of the other pioneers , taking his share in the opening of the country as adviser in questions of hygiene . In 1810 Drake wrote a little volume : Notices of Cincinnati , its Topography , Climate and Diseases . Five years later he published a larger book on the same subject : Natural and Statistical View or Picture of Cincinnati . It was a first experiment . Drake // was working out his system in his own immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth and what it bore , and the climate ; and , on the other hand , its inhabitants , according to their history , the structure of their society , their economic life , and the nature of their diseases . Drake returned to Philadelphia in 1815 , and spent the winter attending courses at the University , using this occasion to obtain the degree of doctor of medicine . In 1817 , his career took a sudden turn when he accepted a call to the chair of materia medica at Transylvania University , Lexington , Kentucky . This was the first medical school to be established west of the Alleghanies . As early as 1783 , while Kentucky was still a part of Virginia , a college had been founded at Lexington , which in 1798 became Transylvania Seminary . In 1799 a medical division was installed . Two physicians , Samuel Brown and Fred-erick Ridgeley , were appointed as professors . This school is no longer in existence . It was first merged with the Kentucky School of Medicine and eventually became part of the University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical life of the West , and its library is still of great interest to the historian , not so much because of its rare volumes as because of the special character of its collection . Twice , in 1820 and 1839 , large sums of around $25,000 were available for the purchase of books . At that time such a sum would go far . The money was chiefly spent in Paris ? which had taken the place of Edinburgh ? and in this way a library was formed which presents an excellent cross-section of medical literature in the first quarter of the nineteenth century . Drake began teaching in 1817 and was a teacher for the rest of his life . His lectures were as effective as his writings , and were attended with enthusiasm . He now had an opportunity to train physicians for the new West . He was not destined , however , for the ordinary routine of a professor 's life . His was too restless and high-spirited a tern94 American Medicine perament . He was by nature a pioneer , an innovator , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never bear to stay long in the same place . Thirteen times he was called to new positions ; he filled nine professorships in five separate medical schools . There was hardly a department of medicine in which he had not given instruction . And what was more , he was himself the founder of medical schools : the Medical College of Ohio in Cincinnati in 1819 , and the Medical Division of Cincinnati College in 1835 . He travelled back and forth between Lexington , Louisville , and Cincinnati , besides spending the year 1830 in Philadelphia , at Jefferson College , founded in 1826 and a rival organization to the University of Pennsylvania . The growing nation needed physicians , and medical schools sprang up like mushrooms . No less than fifty-three schools were founded between 1832 and 1852 . Anywhere , all over the country , a couple of doctors would get together , found a school , admit paying pupils , and proceed to deal out diplomas . It was a profitable business . This was not what Drake had had in mind . To be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physicians . What went on in many places was the most bungling charlatanism . In a series of articles , published in a small volume in 1832 , Drake denounced the existing conditions . Without mercy he put his finger on the sore spots : the inadequate preparation of students , and , for that matter , often of teachers ; the equally inadequate equipment ; the absurdity of supporting a number of competing institutions in one place ( a matter in which he himself had sinned ) ; and the all-too-short period of training . Many schools required only two sessions of four months each . He demanded four years ' training , practical demonstrations by the sick-bed , and asked for state control . The teaching profession ought not to be a business , but a public office , carried out for the public benefit . // His voice , as we will see later , was not heeded . Events had too headlong a course . He went on teaching , and did his level best to raise the standards of medicine . He had not forgotten the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a young man for his own neighborhood in Cincinnati , he must now undertake for t lie entire West . He traversed the region from mountain-range to mountain-range , from the lakes to the ocean , back and forth , visiting every physician , talking things over , and sending out questionnaires . He came to be sixty-five years old . Finally , in 185o , there appeared as the fruit of thirty years ' labor the first volume of his magnum opus , bearing the title : A Systematic Treatise , Historical , Etiological and Practical , on the Principal Diseases of the Interior Valley of North America , as they appear in the Caucasian , African , Indian and Esquimaux Varieties of its Population . This is a magnificent fresco , one of the greatest masterpieces of medico-geographic research . The first volume takes up in order : topography and hydrography ; climate as an etiological factor ; and physiological and social etiology , including a detailed account of the population , its mode of life , its clothing , its habitations , its means of livelihood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until after Drake 's death in 1854 , is dedicated to the study of diseases : malaria , yellow fever , typhoid , eruptive disorders , tuberculosis , etc . It was a great achievement . I know only one European book which could be placed beside this work of Drake 's ; that is Peter Frank 's System einer vollstindigen medizinischen Polizei . These are two very different pieces of work , developed , as may readily be imagined , from entirely different premises . But they resemble each other in largeness of aim and also in their more immediate purpose . Drake , too , was concerned with sanitation and hygiene . In this direction lay that part of his activity which held the greatest significance for the future . // In 185o the meeting of the American Medical Association was held in Cincinnati . As Drake entered , he was greeted by a burst of applause , which it seemed could never end . He tried to speak , but tears choked him . His thoughts went back to his childhood in the forest , to his parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Morgan and Rush were pioneers in their own field , but their most decisive impressions had been received in Europe . Even McDowell had been to Edinburgh . Daniel Drake ( Fig. 8 ) , on the other hand , was a pure product of the American West , rooted in its soil , a man of the people , like Abraham Lincoln . William Beaumont ( 1785 ? 1853 ) William Beaumont belonged to Drake 's generation , having been born in the same year and dying one year after him . His family had come from England as far back as 1635 and settled in Connecticut . William studied medicine with two practitioners , won for himself a license from the state of Vermont , and finally , in 1812 , enlisted as a surgeon in the army . The war with England had broken out . Beaumont took part in several encounters and showed courage and unusual skill . He resigned when peace was concluded and started a private practice in Plattsburg , N. Y. The outdoor life in the army had been very congenial to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwell upon it . In 18i g the army was reorganized and Joseph Lovell , a competent young physician , was put at the head of the Medical Corps . Remembering Beaumont as a comrade of earlier days , he offered him a position in the service , which Beaumont accepted . The government kept a chain of forts along the whole western border . It had first been used against the French , later the English , and now served to hold the Indians in check . Most of the western cities had grown up in the shelter of some such fort . By this time , in 182o , the situation was quiet ; and a // friendly commodity-trade began to ply in these military settlements . Indians came bringing their own products , such as fur , in exchange for every sort of merchandise . It was to one of these forts that Beaumont was ordered : Fort Mackinac on Michilimackinac Island , between Lake Huron and lake Michigan , in the extreme northwest of the Union . The surgeon attached to such a fort usually had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here that the apparently unimportant accident occurred , which was the occasion of Beaumont 's becoming a pioneer in American physiology . One day ? it was the sixth of June , 1822 ? a sudden shot was heard in the settlement store . A gun had gone off and an unfortunate young man had had the bad luck to be standing directly in front of it . Alexis St. Martin , a l , ' rench-Canadian employee of the American Fur Company , received the whole load of buck-shot at close range in his left side . Beaumont was called at once , and was instantly on the spot , but found the man horribly mangled . The chest was torn open , the left lower lung , the diaphragm and the stomach lacerated . The stomach contents came out mixed with blood , shreds of clothing and bone-splinters . It was a sad sight . Beaumont did everything possible but the case seemed hopeless . Strangely enough , the man recovered . His progress was naturally slow . At first he had to be nourished artificially , as otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ten months later the wound was still open and a gastric fistula persisted . The man was wretched , feeble , and entirely without means of support . The authorities felt that he had been cared for long enough and decided to ship him back to his birthplace in Canada . Many physicians would have considered the case closed . But not so Beaumont . He took pity on the young man . He saw that in his condition the journey would be fatal . Since all remonstrances with the authorities proved useless , Beaumont , with a // sudden resolve , took the patient under his own roof and kept him there for two years , feeding , nursing , and giving him medical care , bandaging him sometimes twice a day . St. Martin gained a little strength and was able to walk about , though he was not yet in a condition to earn his living . The gastric fistula persisted . Beaumont decided that he could make use of this fistula for experiments . Here was an ideal opportunity to find out what went on in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digestion had been explained sometimes mechanically as friction and again chemically as fermentation or putrefaction , the eighteenth century had advanced a step farther by means of the studies of Reaumur , Stevens , and Carminati . It was known that the stomach secreted a special fluid which had anti-fermentative qualities and the property of dissolving food . During the following period there was disagreement in regard to the acidity of the fluid , to which Helmont had attributed great importance . Experiments were performed on animals , which were made to swallow perforated capsules containing special foods . After a certain amount of time the capsules were removed from the animals and the changes in the food could be determined . One method of obtaining the gastric juice was to have the animal swallow a sponge fastened to a cord and when the sponge was thoroughly soaked to pull it out again . Beaumont had the advantage of experimenting on a human being , but the disadvantage of working in the wilderness , far from laboratories and books . Another drawback was that his human subject was a most cranky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took in the fact that he was being made use of , he became extremely arrogant , began to lead the most irregular life , and ran away over and over again . The relationship between the two men provides a spectacle at once tragic and absurd . In May , 1825 , Beaumont began to look forward to making his // findings public . In the summer he took two months ' leave , and went east with the main purpose of showing his patient to a few scientists . But it all came to nothing , as St. Martin made his escape and was not to be found . Two years later he turned up in Canada , married and penniless . Beaumont moved heaven and earth to get hold of him again . He was successful two years later . In 1829 St. Martin arrived with his wife and two children at Fort Crawford on the upper Mississippi , where Beaumont was at that time stationed . The fistula was unchanged . The experiments were begun again at once and continued without interruption until 1831 . Again St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time Beaumont had given his consent . Beaumont had made great progress in his observations ; but now he felt the need of consulting with chemical experts , and to this end wished to spend a year in Europe with his patient . leave was granted , but almost immediately revoked , as an Indian rebellion had broken out in Michigan and Illinois . Before the fighting was over , there occurred the first cases of Asiatic cholera , which later grew to a serious epidemic . Every physician was needed . After the cholera campaign was at an end , 1eaumont was given six months ' leave and went home to Plattsburg . Here , to his joy , St. Martin made his appearance . It was too late for a trip to Europe . They went together to Washington : md the work was continued . To keep St. Martin under surveillance , Beaumont had him made a sergeant in the army . After making two hundred and thirty-eight experiments in all , Beaumont collected his observations into a book , printed in 1833 at his own expense and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juice and the Physiology of Digestion . It is a classic ? simple , objective , and careful . What were the conclusions ? The stomach secretes mucus and gastric juice . The last is described in detail . It has the property of liquefying proteins ; has an antiseptic effect ; contains free Too American Medicine acid salts ; is to a great degree influenced by psychic occurrences . The processes of digestion both in and outside the stomach are described in great detail . It is noted that water leaves the stomach very quickly through the pylorus . The movements of the stomach are observed . Finally Beaumont takes up with full particulars the digestion of individual foods as well as the effect of such stimulants as tea , coffee , and alcohol upon digestion and in this way helps to lay the foundation for dietetics . It is a beautiful book which can still be read to advantage , and which at that time aroused the greatest attention . Only a year after its publication , it was translated into German . In 1844 Beaumont and his patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never to return , no matter how deep the interest shown in him by the scientific world . Beaumont was stationed at various army posts , the last being St. Louis , until his resignation in 1839 , after which he carried on a large practice in St. Louis until his death in 1853 . Would Beaumont have become a great man without Alexis St. Martin ? It is hard to say . Chance can not make a scientist . That Beaumont was of the right stuff is shown by the notes which he made as a beginner in Plattsburg and which evidence his gift for accurate observation and his conscientious wish to give an account of every detail which came before his eyes . A lucky accident gave a potential scientist his laboratory material . The fact that he recognized the opportunity and used it to the full in spite of difficult circumstances gives him his place among the leaders of medicine . ( Fig. 9 ) Samuel David Gross ( 1805 ? 1884 ) and James Marion Sims ( 1813 ? 1883 ) We are now well into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history . They are not the first important surgeons America had produced , or rather , not the first physicians to have done good work in surgery . For in spite Pioneers IOT of all Morgan 's endeavors , there was no division between medicine and surgery until almost the end of the nineteenth century : the surgeon continued to carry on a general practice . Before the time of Gross and Sims America could point to prominent surgeons : Philip Syng Physick ( 1769 ? 1837 ) in Philadelphia , a pupil of John Hunter 's , who , though he published nothing , left u great tradition behind him , an eminent teacher and a surgeon who never shed an unnecessary drop of blood ; John C. Warren ( 1778 ? 185o ) at Harvard , the first surgeon to use an ana ; sthetic ; Valentine Mott ( 1785 ? 1865 ) in New York , known for his ligating of great arteries ; B. W. Dudley ( 1785 ? 1870 ) trained in England and France , the pioneer of surgery in the West and teacher for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially for his bladder operations . What gives Gross and Sims their place in history is that they belong to the same generation as William Fergusson ( born in 1808 ) and James Paget in England ( 1814 ) , as Stromeyer and 1. angenbeck ( both 181o ) in Germany , Nelaton ( 1807 ) in France , and Rizzoli ( 1809 ) in Italy . That is to say , a generation which assisted at the rise of pathological anatomy , during its youth witnessed the introduction of ana ; sthesia and remained active far into the era of antiseptics . It was its task to clear the field , though the full harvest was reaped by the next generation . Samuel David Gross ( Fig. 1o ) was a Pennsylvania Dutchman descended from one of those Germans who had come over from the Rhine country in the eighteenth century . His childhood was spent on a farm . He was only a small boy when he first expressed the wish to become a doctor . But first he must study languages ? English and German ? for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a mixture of the two . At the age of sixteen he went to train with a physician . This was still customary . He was not satisfied and changed his teacher several times , till he realized that the fault lay with himself . He IO2 American Medicine was not sufficiently prepared . Though it was a bitter pill to swallow , he left off medicine to go back to school and study Latin and Greek . At last he was far enough along to take up medicine again . He matriculated at Jefferson College in Phila-delphia , and graduated there in 1828 . Now he had accom-plished the first step . A young doctor in Europe , after having passed his examina-tions , could spend a few carefree years in a clinic and as the pupil of some great teacher could train himself in his own specialty until he was equipped for an academic career . Here it was much more difficult . Hospital appointments were mostly in the hands of the older men . One could become the private pupil of a professor , as Gross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means would not permit this , had no alternative after passing their examinations but to go into prac-tice . This was the case with Gross . But he was a born scientist , with an especial bent for anatomy and surgery . He determined to settle down in Philadelphia , which then offered the greatest opportunity to keep in touch with scientific investigations . Philadelphia , however , had come to be a large city . There was no lack of physicians ; and things were not easy for begin-ners . Gross spent eighteen months waiting for patients . Very few appeared and his savings shrank to nothing . It was not an idle time . He worked indefatigably night and day . He translated French and German medical books and wrote one of his own on anatomy and the physiology and pathology of bones and joints . Billroth in Berlin was to pass through a similar experi-ence , but he made the time go by with music . Billroth was finally given an appointment at the Langenbeck clinic ; for Gross there was no way out except to leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Easton , near his father 's farm , and there his practice went much better . Here , too , he was impelled to pursue // his researches . A summer-house was turned into a dissectingn corn . Every possible animal was used for experiment . Now and then , by going to Philadelphia , he could procure for his anat omical studies a human cadaver , which he had to call for himself and drive home in his wagon . Full of plans as always , he began to work on a book , a descriptive anatomy , which howcvcr was never published . In Easton Gross felt isolated from the scientific world . He longed for work with a university . The West stood open and the new schools needed teachers . So in 1833 Gross went to Cincinnati to become demonstrator of anatomy at the Medical College of Ohio , one of the schools founded by Drake . Only two years later he was appointed to the Chair of Pathological Anatomy in the medical department of Cincinnati College , also founded by Drake . He was active there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lectures in America on pathologhal anatomy ; and the outcome of this series was a work in two volumes , of over a thousand pages , and copiously illustrated : the Elements of Pathological Anatomy , which went through several editions , the first comprehensive work in this field in America , indeed in the English language . In 1829 a shorter treatise on the subject by William E. Horner had been published in Philadelphia . Gross was now a famous man . He turned down several appointments in northern universities , but accepted a post in Louisville , Kentucky . It was the Chair of Surgery , his own immediate subject . He remained there sixteen years , except for one winter in New York , till he was called to Philadelphia in 1856 as Professor of Surgery in Jefferson Medical College . This was his own college . This call he must heed . He moved there with his whole family , returning to his point of departure , and stayed there until his death . Gross has written an enormous amount . Whenever his hand was not busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or experiments , it would take up the author 's pen . He wrote innumerable short articles , covering the whole field of medicine , but especially pathology and surgery . In addition he wrote several larger monographs and hand-books . Three great works were completed in Louisville : on intestinal lesions ( 1843 ) , the result of experiments on animals ; diseases , injuries and malformations of the bladder , prostate and urethra ( 1851 ) , a comprehensive work , with many illustrations , which remained authoritative for a long time ; and a treatise on foreign bodies in the organs of respiration ( 1854 ) , the first attempt to sum up the knowledge on this subject . In Philadelphia , in 1859 , was published his surgical handbook : A System of Surgery ; Pathological , Diagnostic , Thera peutique , and Operative , which went through six editions . Gross 's memory does not live by one achievement alone , as is the case with McDowell and Beaumont . During a time of great progress , his influence was predominant in many branches of medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pathological anatomy and surgery . Gross was active in this reconstruction , he carried many bricks to the great building , laid out many cross-sections in his monographs , and in his text-books gave a synthetic picture of the whole plan . And the literary side of his work was the most important . The thousands of physicians , who , often with inadequate training , were scattered over the face of the land , wanted books both for study and reference . Gross provided them . And the fact that they did not come from Europe but were written by an American from the American point of view , made them all the more valuable and easy to grasp . Finally , Gross had great influence through the force of his personality . As a physician of high ideals and tireless industry , he was an example to all , showing what a farmer 's boy could make of himself . Like all great physicians who have been aware of the meaning of their own period , he had a deep understand // ing of history . He wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in 1876 he published an account of the development of American surgery during the century which had just elapsed . Whenever there was a chance , he would use an historical example to bring home to his contemporaries the nature of the developments in which they themselves were taking part . At his death he left behind him the manuscript of his last urrk , an autobiography , published by his sons in a two-volume edition . It is a splendid piece of history . The European reader will for instance be interested in the impressions of a trip to Europe , which brought him in touch with the coryphants of medicine ; or in the pious pilgrimage to the home of Haller , whom he held in such reverence that he named a son after him . There is a statue of him in Washington , not far from the Capitol . The tall figure with its noble scholar 's head is cast in dark bronze and stands out sharply against a green background of surrounding trees . American surgeons raised this monument to the services which Gross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole . James Marion Sims ( 1813 ? 1883 ) ( Fig . II ) was , like Gross , a great surgeon . Like him he had completed his medical training in Philadelphia at Jefferson Medical College , graduating in 1835 , seven years later than Gross . But while Gross from childhood had wanted to be a physician and had steered steadily for that goal , Sims had drifted into medicine without enthusiasm , driven by circumstances . His family lived near Lancaster , South Carolina . His father , the incumbent of several small public offices , dreamed of seeing his son a lawyer , and made great sacrifices to send him to college . Sims would have preferred to go into business , but since his father had spent so much money on him , he could not disappoint him and was forced to study willy-nilly . He had not the 1o6 American Medicine slightest inclination towards the legal profession , nor did he want to become a preacher . So there was nothing for it but to study medicine . He began his studies under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charleston , and finally to Philadelphia . His examination completed , he bought a set of surgical instruments and a chestful of medicines , went home , and hung a large sign on his door . After some weeks he got his first case . An infant was suffering from acute diarrhoea . The father was a prominent man , a tailor , and the former Mayor of the town . Sims made the examination , and feeling quite at a loss , went home to his library , which consisted of seven text-books , and concocted a prescription . It did no good , nor did any of his subsequent prescriptions . The child died . One may imagine with what emotions he followed the funeral procession . A few weeks later a similar case presented itself . Again the child died . Sims would now have liked to give up medicine for good . But he was without means . He had to earn his living by what he had , learned . He left the place which had brought him so little luck , and went west to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Meigs . Here things went better . His practice thrived . He soon earned enough to be able to afford a marriage with a friend of his boyhood . A reputable physician took him into partnership under very advantageous conditions . He now lived in a log-cabin and practised his profession , still without any interest in its larger aspects . When a friend suggested going into partnership in the cloth trade and moving to Mississippi , he agreed , gave up medicine , and sold his house . But just as he was about to leave , the whole business went to pieces before it had even begun and there was nothing for him to do but to resume his practice . Everything went well enough until one day he and his whole family caught malaria . The place was swampy and miasmal . He decided to leave . In December , 184o , he settled in Montgomery , the capital of // Alabama . Sick and without means as he was , he had to begin all over again . But he succeeded . At first only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population and later , gradually , the gentility . He was able to open a small private clinic . Five years later he had acquired the reputation of a good physician and above all of a skillful surgeon . He was the first Southerner to operate successfully on a club-foot , the first to perform a strabotomy . He had already met with success in operating on an abscess of the liver , had undertaken the resection of a jaw , and operated on a hare-lip . These things were being done in Europe , too , but under much more favorable conditions . He had to invent his own instruments and , as so often happens , it was a small group of special cases which led to his future career . Vesico-vaginal fistulas had always proved a trial to the surgeon . Much had been written on the subject , but only a few successful cases were on record . The malady was considered on the whole incurable . It was not uncommon among the female slaves of the South , and chance would have it that Sims came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He operated , but without success . The use of lateral posture and a speculum he had himself invented allowed him a better field of vision than had ever been given previously . A new catheter made it possible to keep the bladder emptied . But all in vain . The fistula would not stay closed . He had the idea of using silver wire instead of silk thread for his stitches . And now , with this sterile material , as we would say nowadays , he met with success . The cases , which had been under clinical care for several years , were all cured within a few weeks . This was in 1849 . In 1852 he made public his cases in the American Journal of Medical Sciences , and the article met with the attention it deserved . Two years later , in 1854 , Gustav Simon in Germany wrote a monograph on the subject . But now that success had come , his practice thriving , and Sims had nothing left to wish for except that this state of affairs would 1o8 American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A son died . He himself was taken with a severe intestinal malady and was not far from death . A change of climate was urgently advised . He was forced to give up everything and go north . Sickness had eaten up his savings . In May , 1853 , he was in New York , ill and poor . He was now forty years old and the fight had to be fought all over again . His last cent went to purchase a house in a good situation . He was no longer a beginner . He knew how to operate t and had made an important discovery . He tried to build up a practice , but his receipts did not suffice even for necessities . His colleagues were interested in his operation and came to see it demonstrated . But instead of sending him patients , they carried out the operation themselves and made the life of this Southerner , who was attached to no clinic and quite friendless , as difficult as possible . At last there came a change for the better , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be recounted . Sims had been pushed by his discovery quite inevitably into the field of operative gynecology . He had in mind the establishment of a clinic for indigent women . But how could this be accomplished in the midst of an indifferent and hostile community ? One of his few friends had a scheme . He brought with him a newspaper man , who took the matter in hand . He rented a hall and sent seven hundred invitations to prominent physicians and laymen for a lecture by Dr. Sims upon the necessity of founding a Women 's Clinic in New York . The newspapers were won over . It worked . Now that the plan was made public , no one could put forward any objection . A board of trustees was set up . Women raised the funds and on May 1st , 1855 , the Women 's Hospital of the State of New York , with thirty beds ? all free ? was opened , with Sims as head physician . Now he could work and operate , and gained more and more // repute as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased daily . A journey to Europe in 1861 turned into a triumphal procession . In Paris he had to demonstrate his fistula operation over and over again , and the results were dumbfounding . Wherever he went , he was invited to operate , and he was soon as well known in Europe as in America . Crowds of women came to him for consultation . He was received by Napoleon III , and while the Empress Eugenie was ill with diphtheria , he was invited to spend fourteen days with her at St. Cloud . After this , his life was led on two continents , now in New York , now in Paris . He was one of the most sought-after gynecologists . He took a distinguished part in the FrancoPrussian War as head surgeon of an English-American ambulance . In 1886 appeared his most important book , Clinical Notes on Uterine Surgery , which was immediately translated into German . During 1881 and 1882 there was published in the British Medical Journal a comprehensive work on hemostasis in the abdominal cavity , on abdominal ligatures and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had described his method of amputating the cervix uteri and his gallbladder operation , as well as giving a very clear picture of the symptom complex of vaginitis . Gross and Sims differed much as men . Both were great surgeons . Both came from the people and had to struggle against poverty and other external difficulties . Both went through a pioneer period in the West . But while the life of Gross progressed in a straight line towards his position as a great teacher and productive writer , the life of Sims went up and down like the waves of the sea until he found his eventual success as practitioner and initiator in the field of operative gynecology. 1 10 American Medicine Oliver Wendell Holmes ( 1809 ? 1894 ) and Silas Weir Mitchell ( 1829 ? 1914 ) The scene of our previous sketches has been laid in Pennsylvania , Kentucky , Ohio , Michigan , South Carolina , and Alabama . It is time to look to the North again , to New England . There , too , the evolution was rapid . Before the Revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colonies ; Philadelphia , founded in 1765 , and New York , in 1767 , where the medical school was affiliated with King 's College . The first university to establish a medical school after the Revolution was Harvard . This was done in 1783 at the instigation of the surgeon John Warren . Further development is primarily identified with the personality of one man , who was a real pioneer in the field , Nathan Smith ( 1762 ? 1829 ) . Born in Massachusetts , he spent his childhood on a farm in Vermont , and went through the usual medical apprenticeship . He graduated from Harvard and spent some time in Edinburgh . He was equally outstanding as a physician and as a surgeon . In 1824 he wrote a classical monograph on typhoid , and later a similarly important one on necrosis . He , too , recognized the necessity of providing educational facilities for the doctors in connection with institutions of higher learning . His idea , a very sound one , was that each state should have one and only one medical school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New Hampshire , at Dartmouth College in Hanover , the fourth medical school of the Union . There , for many years , he was Professor of Anatomy , Chemistry , Medicine and Surgery , all at the same time . He was the faculty . In 1812 a medical faculty was added to Yale University , and Smith was appointed as Professor of Clinical Medicine . Maine and Vermont followed in 1821 . Medical schools were founded in Bowdoin and Burlington , in both cases with the cooperation of Smith . He lectured in both schools . // Oliver Wendell Holmes ( Fig. 12 ) was another Harvard man . He graduated from Harvard in 1829 ; it was at Harvard that he taught anatomy from 1847 until 1882 , and physiology from 1847 until 1871 . His whole life was centered in Boston . He is known primarily as a poet , one of the authorphysicians we come across so frequently . But he has a place in the history of medicine , since he took an active part in its development . his medical concepts were formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the eighteenth century , Paris in the first half of the nineteenth was the Mecca of American students of medicine . The man around whom they chiefly gathered was the great clinician , Louis . From him they learned clinical observation , clinical methods of examination , pathological anatomy , and statistical methods . He was the object of their " reverence , almost idolatry . " Broussais , too , was still on hand but , to use the words of I lolmes , he was like " an old volcano , which has pretty nearly used up its fire and brimstone , but is still boiling and bubbling in its interior and now and then sends up a spurt of lava and a volley of pebbles . " His lectures were followed by those of Andral , and if towards the end of the hour the students became impatient , Broussais " looked almost carnivorous at these interruptions . " Surgery was represented by Lisfranc , " a great drawer of blood and hewer of members . " When he had an attack of bloodletting , rivers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old Empire ? for what ? ? because they had such magnificent thighs to amputate ! " Old Baron Larrey , the surgeon of the Napoleonic armies , was also still at his post . " To go round the Hotel des Invalides with Larrey was to live over campaigns of Napoleon . " But Dupuytren was the greatest surgeon of all . " A square // solid-looking man with a fine head . . . he marched through the wards like a lesser kind of divinity . " Then there was Ricord , the syphilis man , whom Holmes called " the Voltaire of pelvic literature , a skeptic as to the morality of the race in general , who would have submitted Diana to treatment and ordered a course of blue pills for the Vestal Virgins . " Paris offered far more to these young foreigners than Edin-burgh had ever been able to : theatres , music , strolls along the banks of the Seine , not to mention the superb wines , which are so light ( compared with Boston rum and Philadelphia Madeira ) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physiology . " Holmes returned from Paris in December , 1835 , and in the following year published his first book , a volume of thought-ful , witty and graceful poems . But he stuck to medicine , set himself up as a practitioner and , having plenty of leisure , wrote several prize-winning essays : on intermittent fever ; on neural gia ; on the use and significance of direct examination . For several years he was attached to the Massachusetts General Hos pital . In 1838 he became Professor of Anatomy at Dartmouth College , holding this position until 184o ; it was no great burden since he was obliged to give lectures only three months out of the year . At the same time his practice continued , just large enough not to be troublesome . Then , in 1843 , at a meeting of the Boston Society for Medica Improvement , he presented a lecture which placed him all a once in the full light of history . This lecture was printed with the title : The Contagiousness of Puerperal Fever . A violently discussed case had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had died of puerperal fever , had taken sick and died , exhibiting similar symptoms . Holmes becam thoughtful . " I therefore felt that it would be doing a good service to look into the best records I could find , and inquire o // the most trustworthy practitioners I knew , and arrived at the results contained in the following pages . " The results , in a nutshell , were as follows : " A physician holding himself in readiness to attend cases of midwifery should never take any active part in the post-mortem examination of cases of puerperal fever . . . . If a physician is present at such autopsies , he should use thorough ablution , change every article of dress , and allow twenty-four hours or more to elapse before attending to any case of midwifery . . . . On the occurrence of a single case of puerperal fever in his practice , the physician is bound to consider the next female he attends in labor , unless several weeks at least have elapsed , as in danger of being infected by him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to diminish her risk of disease and death . If within a short period two cases of puerperal fever happen close to each other , in the practice of the same physician , . . . he would do wisely to relinquish his obstetrical practice for at least one month . . . . The occurrence of three or more closely connected cases , in the practice of one individual . . . is prima facie evidence that he is the vehicle of contagion . The physician should make proper inquiries concerning nurses and other assistants and give them timely warning of every suspected source of danger . " Holmes ' essay closes with the words : " Whatever indulgence may be granted to those who have heretofore been the ignorant causes of such misery , the time has come when the existence of a private pestilence in the sphere of a single physician should be looked upon , not as a misfortune , but a crime ; and in the knowledge of such occurrences the duties of the practitioner to his profession should give way to his paramount obligations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plainest possible language . Holmes had the satisfaction , during the year that followed , of seeing many physicians allow themselves to be convinced and to exercise greater care . Naturally there was no lack of opposition , // as is to be expected in the case of a theory which blames the physician for the disease . In 1852 two Philadelphia professors raised their voices in protest against the belief in the contagiousness of puerperal fever . One of them went so far as to say that he would prefer to attribute the illness to accident or to Providence , of which he could form some conception , rather than to a contagion of which he could form no clear idea , at least in this particular malady . Holmes answered in a new edition of his essay which was published in 1855 . His material was as impressive as before . In Europe it is Semmelweis who is hailed as the savior of motherhood , the discoverer of the true nature of puerperal fever and the means of its prevention . There is nothing more futile than these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part from a narrowminded nationalism . Holmes , too , was not the first to recognize the contagious character of the disease . In this essay he aims to present confirming testimony out of the past and reaches back through the eighteenth century for his material . Nevertheless , it remains his contribution to have marshalled with convincing power , into a brilliant , immortal essay , all the arguments for the right doctrine , and to have specified successful preventive measures . Semmelweis , who had never heard of Holmes , reached the same conclusions four years later , in 1847 , activated by a similar incident ? the death of a colleague from septic poisoning . Semmelweis 's observations were first announced in December , 1847 ; the conclusive statement was published in 1861 . The two men employ very similar arguments and speak in much the same spirit . But what gave such tremendous force to the teaching of Semmelweis was not his discovery of chlorine as a more effective hand-disinfectant ; it was the tragedy of his life . In the career of Holmes puerperal fever was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was limited . He had a brilliant and correct idea , which he championed with all the // material available , and he fully realized that here lay his great-est opportunity to be of service to society . But in the life of Semmelweis there was no compensation for the hell through which he had passed in the Vienna General Hospital , a hell such as did not exist in Boston . He had undergone torture . He had fought and suffered for his theory against opposition com-pared with which the American opposition to Holmes amounted to nothing . He had died in tragic circumstances , a broken man . All this lent him the aura of a martyr . Holmes , on the other hand , was made Professor of Anatomy and Physiology at Harvard in 1847 , became Dean of the Faculty and developed into a more and more popular author . But be-fore he came so far , he was a witness of an important medical event which took place in Boston , the introduction of inhalation anaesthesia , one of America 's most important contributions to world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need use only a few words . The first to use inhalation anaesthesia for operative purposes was Crawford Williamson Long ( 1815-1878 ) , a Georgia physician , who graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1839 , practised for one year in New York , and after 1 841 in a Georgia village . The euphoristic effect of laughing gas was known , and the inhalation of this gas was a favorite indoor sport . Long now discovered that ether had a similar effect , and one evening at a gathering of friends at his house , he suggested , there being no laughing gas at hand , that they might try ether . He noticed that if at such parties anyone were injured during his ether-intoxication , he would feel no pain . Evidently ether took away the sense of feeling . With the practical sense shown by these country doctors , Long made use of his observations and in March , 1842 , performed a small operation , after having first dulled the patient 's senses with ether . The experiment was completely successful and was repeated several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long did not make public his discovery , and it was not heard of beyond his immediate neighborhood . Why this silence ? Today , with fully developed means of transportation and countless organs of publicity , even the most unessential observation is advertised . In those days conditions were different . With things as they were , what chance to get a hearing would a country doctor in a remote village have ? McDowell , for instance , had waited years before communicating his discovery . In this instance , there was no time to wait . The need of a general anaesthesia was so great that the discovery of a reliable narcotic was inevitable . Long 's method was re-discovered a few years later , this time in Boston . As early as r 800 Sir Humphrey Davy had pointed out the narcotic effect of laughing gas . Decades passed before , in 1844 , the first attempts to use it were made . It happened that a dentist in Hartford , Connecticut , Horace Wells ( 1815-1848 ) had the distinction of introducing laughing gas-anaesthesia into dentistry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend and colleague , William Thomas Green Morton ( 1819-1868 ) developed the idea . It is not accidental that dentists have been leaders in this field , for if anyone ever knew how to inflict the most terrible pain , it was certainly the dentists . Morton , in his efforts to work without giving pain , continued the experiments from 1844 on , and learned from the chemist , Charles Thomas Jackson , that not only laughing gas but ether , as well , would inhibit feeling . On September 3oth , 1846 , he extracted a tooth , using ether with complete success . It was a fortunate circumstance that Morton practised in Boston instead of in the wilderness . He turned directly to the hospital and induced a surgeon , John Collins Warren , to undertake an operation at which he , Morton , was to make the patient unconscious . It was carried out on October 16th , 1846 , and repeated on the following day . There was no doubt that now a // means had been found by which even more serious operations could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to keep his substance secret , to patent and capitalize it , and to reserve all profits for himself . He was not a great man . The discovery , however , was great , and its use spread like wildfire . By the 18th of November it had already been made known to the world in an article by Henry J. Bigelow , and the very fact that recognized surgeons like Bigelow and Warren stood sponsor for it , cleared the way for its reception . It was Oliver Wendell Holmes who coined the terms anaesthesia and anaesthetics . Returning to him after this digression , we find him estab-lished as a professor . For thirty-five years , until his retirement in 1882 , he taught anatomy to the Harvard students , conducted the dissection exercises , gave instructions on the manipulation of the microscope , and , above all , for five days a week at one o'clock delivered a very popular course of lectures . An anatomical lecture can be fascinating or terribly boring ; it can sound like a fairy-tale or like a dull catalogue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discourse on anatomy with wit and eloquence , to make what was dead live , and to cast a spell on his hearers . He was no research worker , no man of the laboratory . He developed more and more into a writer ; he wrote poems , light essays , and novels . It is as an author that he is best known to America , as a representative of the literary group to which Hawthorne , Emerson , and Longfellow belonged . He survived them all , for he lived to be eighty-five years old . But he also deserves to be remembered as a physician . Silas Weir Mitchell ( Fig. 13 ) was another author , but a man of quite a different stamp , much more active in temperament // and above all a great neurologist . As a young man he sent Oliver Wendell Holmes a small collection of his poems , and the latter advised him to put poetry aside and devote himself entirely to medicine . Mitchell took his advice . Not until his fiftieth year did he come forward with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he was already one of America 's leading physicians and one of the great neurologists of his time . He grew up in a highly cultured circle in Philadelphia . His father was a prominent physician . After going to the University of Pennsylvania , he studied medicine at Jefferson Medical College , graduating in 185o . The course at that time lasted only two years . He then spent a year in Paris ( 1851-1852 ) , where he became immensely impressed by the work of Claude Bernard . He returned , started practice and devoted every available moment to research . There were as yet no laboratories in America . For that matter , Claude Bernard and Pasteur had also been forced to begin their work under very primitive conditions , but the resources at their disposal were enormous compared to what a scientist could muster at that time in the United States . In spite of hindrances , Mitchell found ways to join in many kinds of scientific pursuits . In 1853 he was made a member of the Academy of Natural Sciences ; in 1858 he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year before he had been one of the founders of the Pathological Society in Philadelphia . Here , as everywhere , the scientific societies had played a most stimulating part . Their organization was always a harbinger of new knowledge . They became gathering-places for scientific investigation , the more essential since there were no organized scientific departments . Nowadays , every department or institute is a little scientific center , within which a group can benefit by the constant interchange of ideas . At that time all scientists were isolated , and met each other only within the societies . Mitchell was later to initiate the founding of the American Physiological Society , which took place in 1887 and bore rich fruit . // Between 1851 and 1863 Mitchell published twenty-two works which presented important findings : on the formation of uric acid ; on blood-crystals ; on the chiasma of the nerves of the larynx of the turtle ; on the immunity of the pigeon to opium . The outstanding work of that period , however , was a toxicological study on the poison of rattle-snakes . He remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finally with Reichert in 1883 achieved the analysis of toxalbumen . The Civil War broke out and occasioned the opening of a new chapter in Mitchell 's life . The year 1863 found him at the head of a military hospital for nervous diseases . There followed years of unremitting and feverish activity , which drove him farther and farther into the field of neurology . In 1864 appeared the first result of his studies , a book on gun-shot and other injuries to the nerves . He continued his observations for many years and finally published the result of his researches in 1872 in a work which is perhaps his most valuable contribution : Injuries to the Nerves and their Treatment . The war was now over , but Mitchell had been won over permanently to neurology . He became director of a division of the Orthopaedic Hospital , the Infirmary for Nervous Diseases , an institution which he found a small and penurious dispensary and left a great hospital . He led the busy life of a general practitioner , a frequently consulted specialist , and a beloved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His contributions to neurology are many and valuable . He was the first to describe post-paralytic chorea , and erythromelalgia , the first to call attention to the fact that headaches are often caused by eye-strain resulting from uncorrected or insufficiently corrected defects in vision . He was known far and wide as the originator of the rest and fattening cure in the treatment of nervous cases , described by him in a pamphlet , Fat and Blood , which was translated into most European languages . // He was the author of novels , short stories and poems . They were written during vacations as a diversion from more strenuous work , and were widely read in their day . The poet and the physician found a united expression in a series of shorter works , lectures and speeches , in which he approached questions of general interest : the physician and the patient ; death and suffering ; hints for the overworked ; and other like matters . He was one of the curators of the University of Pennsylvania , and took an active part in the reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruitful life , which came to an end on January 4th , 1914 . John Shaw Billings ( 1838 ? 1913 ) Europe has any quantity of books . It has always had them . There were books even during ancient times , though these are no longer in existence . In the Middle Ages the monks did the writing , and every monastery had its library . With the invention of printing came the making of many thousands of books . Every city , no matter how small , supported a library . Universities and learned societies have for centuries made their own collections . In Europe books are taken for granted . They are used quite as a matter of course . In America , three hundred years ago , there were no books at all . The colonists brought with them very little besides their Bibles . In the eighteenth century , libraries like that of John Winthrop , Jr. , were very much the exception . Gradually a real hunger for books made itself felt , and they began to do a little printing in the colonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Benjamin Franklin was one of the Philadelphia printers . And of course books were imported from abroad . Those who went abroad to study brought their text-books home with them . Pupils learned from the books , few enough for the most part , found in their master 's library . It was only through books that America could share in Pioneers I2I the knowledge of Europe . Every learned institution collected its library ; and the library committee exercised one of the most important functions of the institution . As the West was opened up and schools were built in increasing numbers , the hunger for books grew insatiable . We have observed the efforts put forth by the Transylvania University to form its library . Every book is a repository of knowledge and power . In Europe , where books were an old story , this was often forgotten . But in America , where no book was come by without a sacrifice , the attitude towards books became something quite different . Even now that there is no scarcity of books and the libraries are the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in evidence . The architectural plan of a university frequently indicates that the library is its logical center . All other departments radiate from it . The pioneer of the medical library was John Shaw Billings ( Fig. 14 ) . He was an army surgeon and , naturally enough , a Westerner , who had begun to feel the need of books . He had grown up on an Indian farm in the middle of the pioneer country . Even as a child , he had shown an uncontrollable desire for knowledge . He learned Latin and Greek from an old clergyman ; in 1852 he went for five years to Miami University , afterwards studying medicine at the Medical College of Ohio , founded by Drake , and graduating there in 186o . His unusual gifts had attracted the attention of his teachers , and he was not allowed , like the other students , to go immediately into practice , but was retained as a demonstrator of anatomy . Then came the Civil War . Billings enlisted as an army surgeon , saw the whole war through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was present at Gettysburg and other bloody battles . In December , 1864 , he was ordered to the department of the Surgeon-General in Washington , where he was to remain for thirty years . I22 American Medicine He found there a library of 1365 books . This was not a great number . But gradually the idea took shape in his mind that this collection could be developed into a national library of medicine . A European might question the suitability of the office of a Surgeon-General as the starting-point for such an institution . In this case it assuredly was . America is a union of separate states , each exercising wide powers of sovereignty . Medicine and Public Health had been organized in each state separately , while the Medical Corps of the Army was a department which had federal authority . The library grew larger , as Congress agreed to bigger expenditures ; and Billings spent most of his time travelling in search of books . It was a good time to buy . In 1876 the library already owned forty thousand volumes . Another problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also serve as an exhaustive bibliography of medicine . After careful preliminary studies , the first volume of the index catalogue of the Surgeon-General 's Library was published in 1880 . Billings had valuable assistants , Robert Fletcher and Fielding H. Garrison , men who stood by him in his work and carried it on into the future . The first issue of the catalogue comprising sixteen volumes was completed in 1895 . A second edition was immediately begun , and finished with twenty-two volumes in 1916 . The library grew larger and larger . Today it holds more than half a million books . A third edition was brought to a conclusion in 1933 . A fourth is under way . Forty-eight volumes have been published so far . This catalogue is a monumental work , unequalled in medical history since the libraries of Haller , and is indispensable to every medical investigator . The importance of the library itself can be appreciated only by those who live in America and use it constantly . A year before the first volume of the index catalogue was completed , there appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Index 1lMedicus , a bibliographical periodical which keeps the physician informed of important new material in all medical literature . Billings with his co-workers created a mechanism which , through the extraordinary part which it played in the development of medicine in America , has made itself felt all over the world . It is probably the only case in history where a military authority in one country has contributed so much to international knowledge . Billings resigned from the army in 1895 and after a short term as visiting Professor of Hygiene at the University of Pennsylvania , he became director of the New York Public Library , a library of two million books , whose present quarters on Fifth Avenue were built according to his plans . It would be a great mistake to consider Billings merely as a librarian and a bibliographer . Close as this work was to his heart , and though it constituted probably his greatest contribution , he was nevertheless an active leader in a number of other fields . He had learned many things from the army : war-surgery , military sanitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project no matter what its nature . The army has always been the best school for organizers . One of his first tasks in Washington was the reorganization of the Marine Hospital Service . This department had charge of the health of the sailors in the Merchant Marine while in harbors and inland waters , and carried out the quarantine measures which protected the nation from foreign contagions . Billings was successful in doing away with abuses , and put the department in shape to assume increasing responsibilities till finally , in 1912 , it became the U. S. Public Health Service . This we shall return to later . Billings was the authority of his time on the subject of hospitals . The building of the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore , at the time the most modern institution for the sick in the United States , was begun after his plans in 1876 . He was called // in for advice wherever a hospital or a laboratory was to be erected . Finally he was a leader in the development of vital statistics . He recognized the enormous importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that since 188o the census of population has included medical data . For many years he assisted in the analysis of the material so assembled . Billings has written a great deal . His bibliography contains two hundred titles . He is the author of several excellent articles on medical history . Still , he was no literary man , but a man of action , a great organizer , such as was needed in a country deep in the process of construction . Sir William Osier ( 1849 ? 1919 ) It is difficult to write of him , without the privilege of having known him . The readiest pen may well falter . Will it be pos-sible to draw this picture ? Can a way be found to give expression to the feelings of thousands ? It is a temptation to skip to the next chapter after merely setting down : Here was a man who embodied the ideal physician and who was beloved by all . But his influence on American medicine goes so deep that this book would be an organism without a heart , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Fig. 15 ) The physicians of the European continent do not know much about him . The older ones have heard of him as a clinician . They have read some of his works and are perhaps familiar with his text-book which has been translated into French , Ger-man , Spanish and Chinese . To the younger men he is almost unknown . The physician , however , who leaves the Continent to enter the circle of Anglo-Saxon culture , will find himself all at once in a milieu where Osier 's spirit can still be felt . If he travels through America he will see his picture in every physician 's office . Medical libraries are proud to possess an old book , one // of the medical classics , given by Osler and inscribed by his hand . A recently published biography had a sale equalled usually only by popular novels . He is the subject of countless anecdotes . A myth is beginning to form about him . Here at the Hopkins we still feel his presence , though he left us in 1905 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before their eyes . The stranger who encounters this miracle will ask , " Who was Osler ? What is this all about ? Pasteur ? of course , he is known to every child in France and his memory is revered as that of a benefactor who by his great discoveries shielded humanity from disease . Was Osler a discoverer ? Is it his literary work which has cast a spell on posterity ? Or does the secret lie in another d i rection ? " The outward tenor of his life was as undramatic as possible and can be described in a few words . He was a Canadian of Celtic blood , son of a minister , and was himself intended for the ministry . He grew up in a country parish on the edge of the primeval forest , and attended Trinity College in Toronto . Becoming interested in the natural sciences , he gave up the idea of joining the ministry and turned to the study of medicine . After attending McGill University in Montreal , where he graduated in 1872 , he went abroad for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to itself the American students . Vienna , and above all the German universities , were now the main centers of attraction . Osier went first to London , where for fifteen months he worked in histology and physiology and learned to handle the microscope , then later to Berlin and Vienna . Foreign though the German character must have been to him , he recognized the significance of the German clinics and laboratories . He heard Virchow lecture , and was greatly influenced by the clinics of Frerichs and Traube at the Charite . In Vienna , Rokitansky and Skoda were still active , but they were old men ; and it was above all the specialists , the dermatologists , the ophthalmologists , the throat and ear specialists , // like Hebra , Arlt , Jaeger , Schnitzler , and Politzer , around whom the foreigners gathered . Even today , it is first of all on account of its specialists that American students go to Vienna . Osier returned to Canada in 1874 , started a practice , became instructor and later Professor of Medical Institutions at McGill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the University of Pennsylvania as Professor of Clinical Medicine , in 1889 to join the nucleus of the faculty of the Johns Hopkins Hospital , which did not open its doors until 1893 . He remained in Baltimore till in 1905 he went to Oxford as Regius Professor . In 1911 he was knighted by the King . It was an academic career , the most brilliant career within the reach of a medical man in an Anglo-Saxon country . The Regius Professorships of medicine in Oxford and Cambridge , which are not filled by the universities but by the Prime Minister himself , are the highest distinction which England can confer upon a physician . However , other men have achieved these dis-tinctions . Osier 's importance can not be entirely explained in this way . Osier has done much scientific work in pathological anatomy , in all branches of clinical medicines and many allied fields . He was one of the first to investigate blood platelets , and his name will remain linked to many clinical pictures : erythema multi forme , telangiectasis , cerebral palsies in children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But there were many great clinicians at work during those fruitful years when the natural sciences were being perfected and the laboratory was enlisted in the service of medicine . Osier 's text-book , Principles and Practice of Medicine , is an outstanding work and met with a success which its author had not anticipated . Still , there have been books in other countries Strumpell 's text-book , which appeared in 1883 , enjoyed a re ception in the German-speaking world in every way resembling that given by the English-speaking countries to Osier 's book , and // was likewise translated into a number of foreign languages . The two works are closely related in character and belong to the literary deposition of a great age in medicine . Both will one day be recognized as sources of important historical material . The secret of Osier 's influence must be looked for elsewhere . It lies in his personality , in his inimitable qualities as a physician , a teacher , and a man . The resemblance to Hermann Boerhaave comes involuntarily to one 's mind . Boerhaave also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable , can not explain his reputation . Nevertheless , he was the communis Europae magister , the teacher of Europe , the magnet which at the beginning of the eighteenth century drew the whole world to Leyden ; it was he who taught young people to observe and think beside a sick-bed , inspired them to accept the tasks of medicine and filled their minds with the precepts of medical ethics . What Boerhaave had been to the Europe of his day , Osier became for America . Wherever he went , to Montreal , to Philadelphia , he was met with enthusiasm by the young students of medicine . Most pregnant of all were the years in Baltimore . The importance of the Johns Hopkins Medical School to American medicine will be demonstrated more fully in the next chapter . A few words must be said here concerning its beginnings in which Osier took so prominent a part . In the year 1873 there died in Baltimore a merchant called Johns Hopkins , who left his fortune of seven million dollars to provide for a university and a hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daniel Coit Gilman President of the University , and found in him without doubt the most capable man in America at that time . The University , at first limited to a philosophical faculty , was opened in very modest quarters in 1876 . But the University from the outset was based on very different principles from others in America . It was a university in the European sense ; a center of research , // where masters and pupils could unite in the investigation of scientific problems . Gilman found eminent assistants who made it possible to bring his idea of a university to realization . The graduate school being well under way , attention now turned to the medical department , which was to be centered in a hospital . Here again , America was to be given something new , not a mere school which should provide students with two years of medical education ; this , too , was to be a center of research , this time of medical research . And the center of gravity should be , not in the lecture room , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laboratory . We have seen that in 1876 John Billings had been called into consultation and his plans accepted . The hospital was begun the following year . It took many years to build , as the funds were very economically managed . While the walls were slowly rising , the board kept their eyes open for men who would be competent to carry out the ideas of this department . William H. Welch was appointed as pathologist . He had received his training in Germany , had worked with Ludwig in Leipzig and with Cohnheim in Breslau , and had been connected with the Bellevue Hospital in New York . He came to the Hopkins in 1884 and , together with the biologist Newell Martin and the chemist Ira Remsen , began giving courses . The first structure to be finished was a building intended to house the basic sciences . It came to be the first institute of pathology in an American university . And from 1886 on , even before the medical school was opened , an active scientific life was developed , with Welch as its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical men . In the meantime the hospital had been completed and now the fate of the whole institution hung in a great measure on the choice of a clinician . Osier was called from Philadelphia . He accepted on May 7 , 1889 , and was present at the opening of the hospital , a system of red-brick pavilions on high ground , its // silhouette , with the dome of the main building rising above it , visible from a great distance ( Fig. 16 ) . It was a great day ; all eyes began to turn expectantly toward Baltimore . Work was commenced at once ; but four more years went by before , in the fall of 1893 , a memorable year , the medical school was ready to open its doors . The first class comprised eighteen students , three of them women . The faculty was firstrate , with Mall , who had worked with His and Ludwig , as anatomist ; with Abel , a pupil of Schmiedeberg 's , as pharmacologist ; Welch as pathologist ; Osier as clinician ; Halsted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wurzburg , as surgeon ; and Kelly as gynecologist . They were splendid times , those first years at the Johns Hopkins . Everything was new ; there was no shackling tradition . Everyone was young , and filled with an enthusiasm for his enterprise which carried all before it . Here Osier had an opportunity to develop his personality to the full . He worked , lived and had a good time with his pupils , and made them into physicians and scientists . It was for them that he wrote his text-book in 1892 . His clinic was a center of teeming scientific life . Of course , in Europe there were at that time and even earlier many such clinics . But not in America . Here was a medical school which put science before everything , in which from the outset the student shared in research work , where he received his instruction in the laboratory , in the wards . This was something new . What lent persuasive force to Osier 's personality was the fact that in contrast to many European clinicians he was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He collected and read them . He was a born humanist , but not one of those neo-humanists , who believe that the world may be improved by one program or another . In him the synthesis of learning was consummated as something natural and inevitable . So his students learned from him more than methods of clinical examination ; he introduced them to Thomas Brown , // Shakespeare , Montaigne , Cervantes , and Plutarch . His many writings of medical history are exquisite works of art , which bring to life the great physicians of the past , and have con-tributed more to the understanding of the evolution of medi-cine than many works by learned specialists . Soon after coming to Baltimore , he founded a medical history club , which met once a month . His historical interests were shared by Welch and the other Hopkins men , including Billings who came over from Washington , bringing with him treasures from his library . The Bulletin of the Johns Hopkins Hospital constantly pub-lished historical essays as well as laboratory and clinical studies . It is to be noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in American medicine are the ones who have shown this humanistic approach , and it is to this liberal note that the Hopkins largely owes its unique position . When Osier left for Oxford in 1905 , his loss was deeply felt at the Hopkins . But though absent in the flesh , his spirit re-mained present and was renewed in his pupils and in their pu-pils after them . The twenty years he had spent in America were a leaven which will never cease to work . Osier 's hospitable home in Oxford became the Mecca of American physicians . It was a heavy blow when in 1917 his only son fell at Ypres . He followed him two years later , in his seventieth year . His books were sent back to Montreal , to McGill University , which had been his starting-point . His ashes rest among the books which had meant so much to him . CHAPTER FIVE MEDICAL EDUCATION MEDICAL education has already been repeatedly discussed . We have seen that the first phase of its development consisted of a period of apprenticeship , whereby a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him for a number of years . We saw how individual physicians went to Europe and supplemented their training by studies at a foreign university , such as Edinburgh . ' We saw later , as a second phase , the establishment of medical schools , as medical departments of previously existing universities . Let us summarize briefly : in 1765 the first faculty in the country was organized at the College of Philadelphia , later becoming the Medical School of the University of Pennsylvania . New York followed , when in 1768 King 's College added a medical department , which , though it went to pieces during the war with England , was revived later , merged with the College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1814 and was eventually absorbed by Columbia University . Harvard followed in 1783 , Dartmouth in 1798 , Yale in 181o , and , as the first of the western colleges , Transylvania University , which in 1799 opened a medical department , reorganized in 1817 . So far the development had been entirely sound . The schools were well distributed and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best physicians in the country . We have seen many of them as leaders in their several fields . The schools were not intended to do away with the old apprentice method but rather to supplement its inadequacies . The students who came to the universities had as a rule four years of training behind them and had acquired a fund of practical 131 // experience . Many had already won a bachelor 's degree . The medical school in a one-year course offered them the opportunity of increasing and rounding out their scientific knowledge and usually in addition , through its connection with a hospital , the possibility of further clinical training . In order to be near a hospital , the Harvard Medical School moved from Cambridge to Boston in 1807 . If these developments had been allowed to continue without interruption , conditions similar to those in Europe would soon have prevailed . However , the interruption did occur through the opening of the West and the sudden expansion in that direction . The country needed doctors , many more than the few eastern schools could furnish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have watched Drake as the founder of schools . The movement was as irresistible as an avalanche . Medical schools shot up like mushrooms after a night of rain . There were hardly any governmental regulations . Wherever a few doctors were gathered together , they could found a school , get a charter , call themselves professors , give medical instruction in some rented building , deal out diplomas , and pocket the tuition fees . It was a good business , not only on account of the fees , but because former students would enlarge the professors ' practice by calling them in for consultation . It was such a good business that physicians found a teacher 's chair worth paying a good price for and , naturally , it was often on the open market . Instruction was , as may be imagined , quite insufficient . There was a complete lack of medical supplies . The schools were without funds . The only income was derived from the tuition fees and these were for the most part divided among the professors . The libraries were meagre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no corpses were provided for anatomical demonstration , but at the best , a skeleton instead of the usual chest filled with bones . The majority of schools had no connection with a // university , which might have guaranteed a certain standard of education ; or else their connection was merely nominal . Nor were most of them connected with hospitals , so that their instruction was limited to theory . The time required was now as a rule two years , but since there was no division into grades , the second year was nothing but a repetition of the first , and besides , in many places the academic year lasted only sixteen to twenty weeks . No previous training was required of the students . Still worse , these very inferior schools were replacing the old methods of practical training . Formerly an individual physician had his own group of pupils who for a number of years lived and worked in close touch with him . Now this contact was broken . A class received its instruction from a number of physicians in turn , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true that Europe still lay open ; and some students now went to Paris . But a journey abroad was expensive and only a few could afford it . Between 18 lo and 1840 twenty-six new schools were founded ; from 184o to 1876 , forty-seven . With the wave of immigration arose a corresponding number of schools : no less than one hundred and fourteen were founded between 1873 and 1890 . In some states and in individual localities schools were literally heaped one on top of the other . In Indiana there were twentyseven , in Illinois thirty-nine , of which fourteen were in Chicago alone . Missouri broke all records with forty-two . Louisville had eleven schools , as compared with Cincinnati 's twenty . It is difficult to give exact figures , as many of these schools collapsed soon after their establishment , some of them never existing except on paper . It has been calculated that in the course of a century the United States produced over four hundred medical schools . The result may readily be imagined . The country was completely flooded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who saw the danger of this situation . Voices were raised demanding reform . We have heard Drake make his protests and offer his sound suggestions . But these were voices crying in the wilderness . The country was too large and too heterogeneous ; it was being settled at too headlong a rate for any early organization to be possible . The nation must first reach a period of comparative rest and obtain a certain equilibrium . The process of reform was set in motion very gradually and from several quarters at once : the medical profession , the state , and the universities . In 1845 , following a motion made by N. S. Davis , the Medi-cal Society of the State of New York invited all medical so-cieties and schools of medicine in the Union to send delegates to a general congress of physicians to be held in New York . This step was provoked primarily by the realization that medical conditions had become intolerable and that above all there should be reforms in the training of physicians . In spite of in-itial opposition the meeting was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It passed four resolutions : that it would be to the advantage of the medical profession to form a national organization ; that it would be desirable for all medical schools as a unit to demand higher requirements for a doctor 's degree ; that it would be desirable for all young people who were ac-cepted as medical students , to have had suitable preparatory training ; that it would be advantageous for the medical profes-sion to submit to an enforcement of professional standards . The first point was carried : the congress had another meet-ing in Philadelphia in the following year , and organized the American Medical Association . It passed new resolutions for the reform of teaching . But they remained mere resolutions ; lost in the increasing chaos of rapid development . Nevertheless , the founding of the American Medical Associa-tion was of great importance . It provided physicians with a superstate organization , a forum for the expression of opinion , // and above all else , a common professional conscience . At the very beginning a committee on medical education was formed , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it did exercise a moral authority . It was to have an important share in the reorganization of medical training during the twentieth century . The intervention of the states proved to have greater , indeed paramount importance . We have seen that in the beginning of the colonial period , the practice of medicine was in no way controlled , anyone having the right to treat patients , but that even before the Revolution some states established certain standards , prescribing a minimum period of training and making the right to practise dependent on the acquisition of a license . New Jersey led the way by introducing a state medical examination in 1772 . These were promising beginnings . There was always the question as to where the authority to confer the license should rest . A doctor 's degree from a European university of itself entitled the bearer to practise in the colonies ; quite correctly , since the degree was the guarantee of a sufficient preparation . Now that medical schools which conferred diplomas were being established at home , it was natural that these , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools came to confer the doctor 's degree and the license at one and the same time . There were , however , still a great number of medical students who never attended a university , contenting themselves with supervised work under a practitioner . From whom were they to get their licenses ? When Daniel Drake began to practise , his only diploma was the certificate of completed studies given him by his master . This state of affairs persisted for a long time in many places in the West . In the East , on the other hand , medical societies , formed as // early as the eighteenth century , were given the right by the states to establish minimum training requirements and to award licenses . This was in itself a sound development . The medical profession was allowed to bring order into its own house . But now followed the tremendous changes of the nineteenth century , which in this field , too , led to chaotic conditions . The medical schools conferred the license to practise at the same time as the doctor 's degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew beyond calculation and that many were inferior from the start . The more numerous the schools , the lower sank the average level . A school which had insisted on difficult examinations would very quickly have lost its pupils . And on the pupils depended its very existence . Voices were raised repeatedly demanding that the examinations for doctor 's degree and the state license should be held separately and un-der different jurisdictions . It was no use ; the schools raised a lively protest , in words fairly dripping with virtue . And even in those localities where the licenses were under the control of medical societies , conditions became gradually worse . We will see later that during the nineteenth century there flourished not only religious , but medical sects . Each of these sects founded its own societies which claimed the same right as the legitimate medical societies to confer licenses . What was more , they exercised that right . Quackery had official sanction and those who could not procure a license from a medical so-ciety could always get hold of a perfectly valid license from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been reached . After 1835 there was a marked tendency among the states to establish state boards of medical examiners appointed by the Governor . The idea was good , but premature . There was the problem of filling the positions . Political influences made them-selves felt . In some places physicians nominated by the medical societies were appointed . Elsewhere , however , the various sects // were represented on the commission , and in still other places , they had their own examination boards . So nothing much was accomplished in this way . Towards the middle of the century these commissions were dissolved . They died of their own impotence . And again medical practice became a free-for-all proposition . The reaction came in the seventies . Conditions had become unendurable . Something had to be done to protect society from the pseudo-physician . And as there were good reasons for not putting the medical examinations in charge of the schools , there was nothing left but to have the state again assume the sole right of licenture . Statutes were passed to this effect . Again examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first in Texas in 1873 , in 1874 in New York and Kentucky , in 1875 in New Hampshire , and in 1876 in California and Vermont . By 1895 practically every state had its examination board . The nation was more mature ; its growth had become less rapid , so that the mistakes of the earlier days could be avoided . Naturally much still depended on the individuals composing the board and on their way of handling examinations . As is still the case , only written examinations were given , making it possible for students from inferior schools , if cleverly drilled , to obtain brilliant marks . Even today the problem of state examinations has not yet been solved satisfactorily , as we shall see later on . Nevertheless , the establishment of these boards was a great step forward . They at least gave the state an indirect control over the schools ; there was moreover the possibility , even if not put to immediate use , of direct interference , since the state could make the right to take examinations dependent upon certain conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it was at first a negative step ; the eradication of the rankest growths . The // country was still swarming with inferior schools and , even in the better ones , the instruction was by no means up to the highest standards of the time . Now we understand the importance of the Johns Hopkins Medical School . It was the first positive step towards the reorganization of medical education . A model was provided , and it found imitators . Physicians from Johns Hopkins soon proved their superiority . Today they are found in leading positions all over the country . It was soon generally recognized that the teaching of medicine can never be an exclusively academic matter , that laboratories , dissection rooms , and clinics are indispensable for practical instruction . It was further recognized that medicine is a university subject requiring contact with other branches of science . The realization of these facts had the fortunate result of closing automatically a large number of former medical schools . A school founded on a commercial basis could pay its way only as long as its expenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded laboratories , hospitals , and other expensive equipment there was not the slightest chance of keeping down to the income derived from tuition fees , much less of making a profit . Other schools followed the example of Hopkins . The large eastern institutions were reorganized one after another . In the ' West and Middle West state universities were established which from the start included a medical faculty and which knew how to make use of the new methods . In spite of all this , progress was slow . The opening of the twentieth century found plenty of abuses still persisting . Then in 1908 a great reform was set on foot . The Carnegie Foundation commissioned Abraham Flexner to prepare a report on the prevailing conditions of medical education in the United States and Canada . For two years Flexner travelled all over the country , visiting the 155 existing schools ( including those in Canada ) . In 1910 he published his report , which exposed withMedical // out hesitation all surviving abuses . But the book was more than a merciless piece of criticism ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now the great reorganization began to be carried out in a systematic manner . Again many schools which , according to Flexner 's report , had no future before them , closed their doors . Others , however , were put on a firmer basis with the assistance of the General Education Board , one of the Rockefeller foundations , which had Flexner at its head . The regional needs were taken into consideration . As the South was badly provided for , the medical school of I'ulane University at New Orleans was enlarged and expanded . With the help of wealthy patrons , Duke University was established at Durham , North Carolina , and the medical school of Vanderbilt University at Nashville , Tennessee , became a center for that section . In Rochester , New York , a modern university was founded , to which Eastman , the kodak manufacturer , contributed a large endowment . The new schools needed professors , and looked largely to I Iopkins for the supply . Often the faculty of a school would be essentially a graft from the Hopkins stem . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington University in St. Louis , and the University of Iowa were all developed with money given by Rockefeller . So it went on without a break . Wherever a sincere interest in reform was shown , abundant means would be forthcoming . And everywhere Abraham Flexner was the leader and adviser . Hand in hand with this reorganization came the introduction of a system much discussed in America , and little understood in Europe ? the so-called full-time system . The plan is very simple . Originally , professors of medicine in America , as in Europe , were physicians who earned their living by their practice and gave university lectures on the side . This is still the rule
