So long as the world bought Zion candy bars , Zion cookies . Zion lace , Zion books and Zion cement it could smile as it would at Wilbur Glenn Voliva 's dire prophecies and belief that the earth is soup-plate shaped . But it could not dispute the grim , lap-jowled prophet 's absolute mastery of his own tight sectarian world of Zion City , Ill. , on the lake shore 40 mi. north of Chicago . Owner of its communal industries and General Overseer of its Christian Catholic Church , Prophet Voliva banned tobacco , liquor , cinemas , profanity , immodest dress and chewing gum from his realm and ruled its 6,000 inhabitants body &; soul . <P> But Depression came and the outside world stopped buying so many candy bars and cookies . Zionites grew restive , grumblingly drifted off into new sects . Year ago Prophet Voliva 's world cracked under him when Zion 's industries , once worth $10,000,000 , went into receivership ( TIME , June 12 ) . Last week that world was heaving in open rebellion . <P> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last fortnight voters went to the polls , scratched three independents into the school board . Wrathfully last week Overseer Voliva tossed back a vengeful thunderbolt . Closing his parochial school ( enrollment : 950 ) , he declared that the town 's two public schools ( enrollment : 500 ) could take care of his ousted pupils or shut down too . <P> Next day the public schools opened as usual , laid plans to run extra shifts for the parochial pupils . Threatened with tar &; feathers , Prophet Voliva declared himself a two-gun man ready to kill at the drop of a hat . Then he announced that he would reopen all but the lower grades of his parochial school , require every pupil to take an oath of allegiance to him . Satan and his imps would try to destroy the world sometime in September , he said , and he needed an organization " like Hitler 's " to combat them .
