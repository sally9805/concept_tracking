txt The Cornell varsity crew swept to a sterling victory in the intercollegiate rowing regatta late today , ending a stern chase that had lasted for fifteen yiars . Rowing at little , more than a paddle through rough water and against a head wind , the winners rolled home more than three lengths ahead of Syracuse for their first varsity , victory on the Hudson since 1915 . In third place came the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , after setting a blinding pace through the opening miles of the four-mile event , and away in the ruck , splashing and making heavy weather of it , came the crews which had been favorites before the start . Never since the crews of the Far West began coming to the Hudson has there been such complete rout for them . Only California managed to stay in the fight at all , and it was forced to be content with fourth place ; not quite able to catch this Tech crew that today , on its second visit to this greatest of college races , turned in a magnificent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came Columbia , fighting off Washington , the heaviest favorite before the start , and behind them Penn and Wisconsin . Navy , which had been coupled with Washington before the start , never finished the race . It stopped rowing 100 yards from home with the gunwales awash and the men were taken from the shell by their caching launch . Starts Made Nearly on Time . Every effort had been made to avert another scene of confusion such as turned last year 's event into a wild scramble at the finish . The races were run off pretty much on time , and there were no false starts . But the weather refused to cooperate . A southeast wind blew up the course and threw up quite a sea . Even so , there was no excuse for the swamping of the Navy . That came from the wash of a Coast Guard cutter and a half dozen launches that chased up the side of the course after the leading crews and threw their wake into the lanes of the struggling , fighting men in the trailing crews . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat race has seen . All through the last mile Washington and Columbia and Navy had to work against the sea kicked up by these craft as well as by the wind . It proved too much for Navy . All through the afternoon of racing , oipsets were turned in . Never before have favorites been so rudely treated as they were this afternoon . In the freshman race at two miles old Jim Ten Eyck sent another finely rowed boat to the start that made short work of the favored Columbia , Navy and Washington boats , and , to add to the surprise , Cornell came in second . Then , in the three-mile junior varsity event , Cornell served notice of what was coming in the final race by going out in front to make the racing and leave open water dancing between its stern and the prow of the Washington boat , which had been considered just a bit slower than the favored Washington varsity . For Cornell tonight there was the return of the past . Not since the old man of Cornell 's ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - of Cayuga Lake , has the Red and White had such an afternoon on th water . The Cornell substitute oars man , dancing crazily on the roof o his boathouse as he watched the fin fish , was a symbol of , a return from the tail of the river . Back in 1926 , when Washington and Navy fought it out at the head of the parade , Cornell came limping home last of eight crews . That was the only time that it had ever been at the tail of things , and it was the low-water mark for a. rowing tradition that holds more Poughkeepsie victories than any other . The next year Jim Wray , who had coached for years at Harvard , went to Ithaca and the Red and White began to climb back . There was a good crew last year , but it foundered in the rough water . Tonight the veteran Wray stood calmly in the bow of the coaching launch , which is named " The Old Man , " after Courtney , and watched his boys end at last the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splendid , heady and well-planned race . There was no scrambling and no hurry . With Tech setting a blinding pace through the first two miles , Cornell slowly closed in and moved up through the field to challenge the game youngsters from Boston who were making such an amazing showing . Soon after the start of the second mile Cornell had - moved into the lead . It began adding . to that lead and it never was seriousay threatened . It was a great , finished job of rowing . The picture was complete again today for this huge regatta in which twenty-three shells fought it out over the waters of the Hudson . Day dawned without a cloud in sight and the sun long before noon was pouring down the blistering heat of a furnace . This is a late crowd here , one which comes , for the most part , the morning of the race . Hotels were filled last night , but this morning by lunch time they were packed like the platforms of a subway station . When the varsity crews started there must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curve along Poughkeepsie 's water front and on a fleet of yachts and small boats that stretched solidly along the Poughkeepsie side of the river from the towering railroad bridge which marks the start of the last mile to the finish . All morning long and well into the afternoon the streets of the city were jammed solid with automobiles , crawling along at a snail 's pace . Then , earlier than usual , for the races were held earlier this year , the descent on the river began . And it is a literal descent here , for the roads to the river drop almost straight down , and at . the foot of Main Street lies the ferry dock and S. wharf front that was jammed with craft of all sorts . The problem of crossing the river here is a grave one and all through the middle of the day ferries picked their solemn way across to the observation train on the other side , black with people and with an amazing fleet that included everything from tugboats to canoes darting in between . Finally the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fast-moving coaching boats that flashed back and forth on mysteriously important errands , the colors of their college snapping in the wind at their bows . Day Liners Come Upstream . Upstream came two , then three , and finally a fourth lumoering day liner , the fourth bearing two huge Columbia pennants high above her sacks . Robert Herrick 's trim-looking Gypsy , with the veteran referee , Julian Curtiss , standing up forware began heading upstream , to be followed by a small , white launch which announced by its signs that it was to broadcast the afternoon 's proceedAcross the river , just above Poughkeepsie , the new lumber in the yards there looked like piled gold in the sun , the golden fleece toward which these eights would head in the varsity event . . There was fair water for the freshman race and the officials did a good job at getting the crews under way . And the junior varsities also started Promptly . The wind was getting in its work , however , and they splashed and they ran into patches of dirty water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the full four miles of the varsity event the crews were all there . Sprawled across the river they headed in every direction , a school of strange water bugs that had been startled into confusion . The sun had been hidden by a heat haze that hung over the tops of the hills across the stream like a light fog and made the setting somber and gray . Clouds , with a threat of rain in them , piled up and the water , choppy and dark , lay in a colorless mass from shore to shore . Delay at the Start . it . Before the crews finished the mile M. I. T. was in front and it continued out there to open up at least a length lead . Now and then it seemed it had left open water on some of the others . Tech , rowing well and getting good results , stuck out there almost unchallenged for nearly the entire second mile . Behind it through that second mile , the rest of the field began to take on the amazing shape it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be apparent that Washington , from whom . so much had been expected , was not the crew it was thought . The white cedar shell in which the Westerners rowed was buried back a few lengths , with Columbia hanging resolutely to its port side . Navy Begins to Fall Back . Navy , another of the favorites , also began falling back through this second mile . Of the Westerners , only California remained at all in the picture . The Golden Bears , also fairly well in-stream with Cornell , shoved their craft slowly up out of the surrounding crews . Cornell , paddling along at the amazing pace of 26 strokes to the minute , moved steadily up into the fight and , as Tech began tiring , moved up alongside . Bob Wilson , the sophomore who was stroking his first race , was turning in a splendid job for the Ithacans . The boat behind him was unhurried and calm , looking for all the world as though it were out for an evening practice paddle . Calmly and steadily Cornell passed Navy and California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had given a tremendous lot in setting that opening pace , but it still had enough left to provide the Ithacans with their only real fight in the entire race . Cornell caught Tech at the , end of the second mile , but for almost a half mile the Bostonians hung on hard and made Cornell work for it . But there was no holding Cornell tonight . With the even , steady run of a steamer it continued toward the finish and finally Tech , despairing of hanging onto this emotionless eight that had come up to join it , dropped slowly back . At the two-and-a-half-mile mark Syracuse came dancing along to join the festivities . Its Orange flag flapping in the front , this Syracuse crew that had been granted only the slimmest of outside chances came up at a low , steady paddle . Cuts Down Tech 's Lead . California , still making pretty good weather of it , could not stop it , and Syracuse sailed into third place . Then , just as Cornell had done , it began to cut down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile Syracuse had Tech . Tech did not have quite enough left to stand the Orange off , and the game Boston eight dropped steadily off as Syracuse , rowing strongly , continued in the battle . For just a brief while there was the thought that Syracuse would continue to the head of the procession . But apparently the thought never entered the heads of the men in the Cornell crew . With the bald head of the huge going steadily and methodically back and forth at 5 , like a shining shield of victory , Cornell continued to paddle on through the closing stretches of water below the bridge , There was no drama at the finish . It was simply the stubborn , dogged courage of an eight that simply would not be caught . Syracuse could n't match that . It stopped gaining and the open water , plenty of it , rolled free between the two shells as Cornell rolled over the finish , sitting up and rowing not much more than thirty-two even in the last strokes of the battle . Tech had managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ride home in third place , and to do it , after a brief , sharp battle in the last mile , with plenty to spare . Cornell 's winning time was 21:42 . Others Are Far Behind . There was quite a delay at the start , with the crews loafing on their oars , coaching launches hovering about them , as the stake boats were lined up by surveyors on the shore . Two seaplanes , waiting to rush pictures of the start to New York , circled and came down to wait as a Coast Guard boat rushed over to warn them and sent them further upstream . Finally Syracuse pulled up to Its stake boat and the others gradually headed into line . One by one they came into position and stretched across the river , an amazing array of craft . Columbia 's coxswain , Walter Michels , poked his hand in the air and pointed at Washington alongside . The Westerners ' stake boat was out in front of the others , so that Dick Harris , in the coxswain 's seat , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The referee 's launch closed in to have a look and then turned in a wide , sedate circle to come back behind the centre of the field . Apparently it was too late to do anything more about the stake boats . Curtiss 's voice , high-pitched and dramatic , roared out of the megaphone and reached- the observation train . He I asked twice for the ready before all the coxswains ' hands went down and then , after what seemed a tremendously long wait , the pistol in his hand barked out and the nine motionless shells came to life as suddenly as though they had each been shot . It was a fairly even start , with Columbia and Washington , far out in the river , biting in a shade more i quickly , than the others , but not gaining much of a jump . Almost im- i mediately the Tech crew , which had been considered as a real dark horse , began the pace-setting which made its first two miles so dramatic . Before a half mile had been fin- t fished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the front . It was not rowing high , none of the crews was rowing high . They had all come down quickly out t of their racing starts , for the water was too rough for anything but the most careful oarsmanship . Tech , rowing at about 32 , moved steadily out from the ruck , with the rest of the crews very well bunched 1 behind . It shoved into third place by the time the half mile had been f passed and was setting sail for Penn r and California , just a bit ahead of t Behind , lengths and lengths back , came the rest of the field , badly beaten and getting the worst sort of treatment from the launches that followed . Columbia and Washington had really been the only crews racing . Between them the finest kind of a fight had gone on . But they never had a chance to finish it out decently or to close up any water on the leading crews . The Coast Guard boat threw its wash all over them , the wash once almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired , stern chasing hopefuls had to slam into the worst sort of water nearly all through the last mile . Columbia finally lasted the better and came away to win this separate ittle battle . Behind it was another fine fight between Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and it was a very close thing , Penn finally being dedared the winner there by the margin of a fifth of a second . A hundred yards from the finish Navy finally ran into a wave that smothered it . The men splashed gamely for a stroke or so and then t was impossible to go any further . Old Man Glendon headed his launch into them and they were taken aboard . For Navy , Washington and California the result was a bitter disappointment . For most of the others here was some satisfaction , though Columbia , ruler of the river last year , was lengths behind the leaders . It was an odd race , rowed at nothing like a racing stroke . For he second year in a row , the river had prevented a real race . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means , and there can be no credit taken away from the great , beautifully earned triumphs of the eaders , Cornell , Syracuse and Tech . They chopped their clean-cut perormances out of the river and they owed a far better race than any of heir competitors .
