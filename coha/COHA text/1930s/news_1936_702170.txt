txt King Leopold , in a statement to a Cabinet council here today , announced Belgium had severed her military alliances and was resuming her pre-war neutrality . It was the first Cabinet council over which the King had presided , and his statement received additional weight from the fact that his declarations , usually considered strictly confidential , were afterward issued for publication . The Cabinet meeting had been called to consider the military status of Belgium and the new military program to maintain Belgium 's integrity . " Reoccupation of the Rhineland , which abrogated the Locarno accord , practically placed our country in its pre-war position , " said the King . " Our geographic position forces us to maintain a military organization capable of preventing any of our neighbors from crossing our territory to attack another country . Holds Alliances Inadequate " Alliances , even defensive ones , would not serve us because , prompt as it might be , aid could not reach us before the first shock of the invader , which might be overpowering and against which we must prepare to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Minister of Foreign Affairs recently stated , that we must henceforth pursue an exclusively Belgian policy . This policy should be directed resolutely toward withdrawing our nation from the quarrels of our neighbors . It can be sustained by reasonable military and financial effort , and it will be approved by Belgians , who are all filled with an intense desire for peace . " In government circles it was made clear tonight that the new policy adopted by Belgium included a return to neutrality , the end of the Franco-Belgium military alliance , abandonment of collective security pacts and abstention from any Locarno pact that the Western powers may conclude . Prolongation of the military service term was decided on at the Cabinet meeting . The bill incorporating this new measure and providing for a general reorganization of the army will be presented to Parliament at a special session the latter part of this month . Whether it will get the approval of Parliament is uncertain as there is considerable opposition , but it is hoped that a majority will respond to the King 's appeal . 18-Month Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months , but recent events have necessitated lengthening the period . Now it is proposed that three-fifths of the recruits shall serve twelve months and twofifths eighteen months . Volunteers will be enlisted in a special motorized corps for five instead of three years . It is aimed to provide a strong covering force on every frontier with a mobile mass in the interior . As reasons for this armament program the King listed Germany 's rearmament , the militarization of Italy and Russia , the transformation of war tactics through intensive motorization , German reoccupation of the Rhineland , a decline in the value of international security agreements , such as the Treaty of Locarno , and a decline in the strength of the League of Nations . " Internal dissension in certain States , " King Leopold said , " is threatening to extend to rivalry between governmental systems and to bring about a conflagration of such a devastating nature as to make it impossible for Belgium to escape the consequences .
