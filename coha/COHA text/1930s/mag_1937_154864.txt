Manhattan is proud of its clear , sea-born air , which , especially in the first days of fall , Manhattanites find as heady as a new vintage . Manhattan is also proud of its nightspots , where the atmosphere , though equally shady , is not so crystal-pure . When Repeal put an end to Prohibition 's frowzy summer , Manhattan 's undercover nightclubs , legally uncorked at last , popped and fizzed into a boom-de-ay of business gaiety . When the egregious Billy Rose converted a theatre into his Casino de Paree , where hundreds instead of scores could wine , dine , dance and watch a show , he started something .

An escalator led up to a cocktail-and-dancing lounge . In a huge elliptical room whose shallow-bowl shape made it seem smaller than it was , 1,300 people could dine , dance and watch a show on a stage that moved up , down , sideways and around , had so many complicated mechanical gadgets that a last-minute breakdown forced the management to cut the opening show in half . The show itself , like the rest of the International Casino , was on the grand scale more calculated to appeal to the world- &-his-wife; than to sophisticated socialites , included a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new style , plump , dimple-backed , languorous European chorus girls with bangs in their eyes .
