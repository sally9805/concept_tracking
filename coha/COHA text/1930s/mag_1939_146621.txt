By doctors and patients familiar with it , tic douloureux or trigeminal neuralgia is considered the most painful of human ills . It is a nerve affliction which usually strikes one side of the jaw , occasionally both . The slightest stimulus on certain " trigger areas " of the face may set off lightning-like flashes of agony . Living in dreadful anticipation of the next attack , victims sometimes go weeks without shaving or washing their faces . Cause of tic douloureux is not definitely known . Tooth and sinus infections , circulatory disorders , sudden changes of climate have all been suspected. * <P> Various medications have been used for relief of tic , such as alcohol injections , salicylates , trichlorethylene . Latest proposed treatment is Vitamin **25;2915;TOOLONG ( TIME , May 8 ) . But all these treatments are palliative , none gives permanent relief . Surgical cutting of nerves in the face was tried as early as 1748 . Since then the surgical technique has been refined to include cutting of nerve roots and ganglions in the brain . <P> In Milwaukee last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described what he considers the best modern technique for relief of tic douloureux . It is a brain operation performed with the patient in a sitting position , under local anesthetic . Dr. Klemme makes a hole about the size of a quarter in the skull under the temple , lifts up the brain , exposes the root of the fifth cranial nerve , which serves the upper and lower jaws and the eyes . He delicately separates the fibres , severs only the sensory jaw fibres . In this way he has successfully relieved some 200 tic sufferers . In no case has the pain recurred . <P> Dr. Klemme described the operation at a meeting of the American Dental Association . The dentists were interested because tic douloureux is often mistaken for jumping toothaches or nerve pain following extractions and dental anesthesias . <P> <P> *In Milwaukee last week a Wisconsin dentist , Dr. T. A. Hardgrove , gave it as his opinion that pockets of typhoid germs are responsible for tic douloureux , said he had tried typhoid vaccine with success .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
