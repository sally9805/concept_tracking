S. a Congressman has utilized a radio station to obtain the attention of his fellow members of Congress . <P> Thus did Washington 's station WOL , hooked up for the occasion with Cincinnati 's big WLW , last week present some free radio time to Indiana 's 73-year-old Representative Finly H. Gray for the first of a series of addresses on money and depression . " Mr. Speaker and fellow members of Congress , " hopefully began gaunt , gold-toothed Representative Gray , who had informed his colleagues by letter and in the Congressional Record of his intention to take the air to harangue them at greater length than even his spectral appearance has ever induced them to listen to him from the floor . <P> Representative Gray , whose central conviction is that Congress has delegated to the President and the Federal Reserve System too much of its power to regulate the currency , devoted his first 15-minute speech to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I thank you , fellow members of Congress , for your attention . " His seven remaining talks will include discussions on The World Panic and the Disasters Following , The Remedy for Depressions , What Is Inflation ? " I want to explain this Depression , " says conscientious Finly H. Gray , " and at the close of the session you ca n't get enough time to thoroughly discuss a question . . . .
