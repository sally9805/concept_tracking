I 'LL TAKE THE HIGH ROAD-Wolfgang Langewiesche-Harcourf , Brace ( $2.50 ) . <P> " Flying , " writes Wolfgang Langewiesche , " is now possible for any person of normal intelligence who is in good health and is financially able to eat regularly . " It costs $275 or less to build up the flying time required for a private license. * Thanks to the light loads their large wings carry , " light planes , " which commercial pilots call flivvers , pop-bottles , and of which an unprecedented 2,500 are being turned out this year , are all but foolproof . They cost as little as $1,098 new , far less at secondhand , may be hired at 4 per seat per mile . In one such , Langewiesche flew from New York to Key West . The cost of fuel , oil , hangars , a standard 20-hour engine check , was $21.50 . <P> In a sense Author Langewiesche 's informative , engaging book is merely a skilful advertisement for flying-for-the-fun-of-it and for the planes which make such flying possible .

What he has done is simply to give a deftly selective account of his own career as an impecunious amateur : the virginal application for lessons ; first flight cross-country , by dead reckoning ; a siege of " aero-neurosis , " parachuting , a flight along the desolate eastward shelf of the continent . By the time he is done he has set straight a number of groundling misapprehensions , has clearly suggested a seeing and reading of a world no groundling can know , has need neither to explain his own love of flying nor to persuade others . <P> I 'll Take the High Road is capable of interesting a far more general , more sedentary audience than those whose interest in flying is already active . For Author Langewiesche has an uncommon talent for conveying , not merely describing , physical sensations . He is , moreover , both as airman and writer , a skilled amateur , with the wisdom never to desert his amateur standing . Of the 25 photographs , most are well above the shoddy average for book illustration , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , as for registration , Government inspection , no charge is made .
