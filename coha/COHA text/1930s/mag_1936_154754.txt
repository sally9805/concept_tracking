Near Somerville , N. J. one day last month Trooper William A. Turnbull of New Jersey 's State Police sighted a blue sedan scorching down the highway , gave chase , forced the speeders to stop . While he was arguing with the driver , another man and a woman got out of the automobile , poked pistols in his back . In the car they stripped , bound and wrapped him in a blanket , drove 50 miles to a spot near Bethlehem , Pa. where they dumped him out with his wrists bound , lips taped . <P> In New York City 's rogues ' gallery Trooper Turnbull identified his abductors as midwestern bank robbers named Harry Brunette and Merle Vandenbush . Because they had carried him across State lines , breaking the " Lindbergh Law , " the Federal Bureau of Investigation was notified . <P> One day three weeks ago two New Jersey troopers appeared at a police station in Manhattan 's upper West Side , reported that a repair bill from a nearby garage had been found in the kidnappers ' abandoned automobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them on the case . The G-men preferred to work alone . New York City detectives and New Jersey troopers then discovered that Brunette had lately married a resident of upper Broadway , set a watch on her family 's house . At this point , according to police , the G-men offered to join forces with them . Together they traced Brunette 's wife to a ground-floor apartment on West 102nd Street . Two New York detectives , one New Jersey trooper and one G-man were planted in the same house and in an adjoining house . Plans were made to seize Brunette , a daytime sleeper , one afternoon last week . <P> The two city detectives had gone around the corner for a cup of coffee at 1:15 a. m. on the appointed day , when Chief John Edgar Hoover suddenly appeared with ten G-men , proposed an immediate raid . Refusing to wait for police headquarters to be notified , the No. 1 G-man and his squad rapped on Brunette 's door , got a splatter of bullets for answer . For an hour they pumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombs into the apartment . Its Venetian blinds ignited . Firemen came , and were caught in the cross fire between desperado and G-men . Shot in the thigh , Brunette 's wife staggered out of the smoking apartment . His pistols empty , Brunette soon followed with hands in air . <P> That afternoon the old friction between local and Federal law enforcement agencies flared up at its hottest . First anonymously , then in the person of hardboiled , up-from-the-ranks Commissioner Lewis J. Valentine , New York 's police officials filled the newspapers with charges that G-Man Hoover had broken his agreement with them and , purely to make headlines and grab all the credit , had endangered the lives of bystanders and firemen by his unnecessary gunplay.
