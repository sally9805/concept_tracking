txt Despite a prediction , made by Charles E. Mitchell , chairman of the board of directors . of the National City Bank of New York , in testimony today before a Senate committee , that a Federal bond issue of $3,400,000,000 to provide money for cashing veterans ' bonous certificates would mean hundreds of bank failures , a favorable vote on the proposal by the Senate Finance Committee was predicted tonight . Mr. Mitchell declared that the portfolios of all the banks of the country would have to be readjusted on a new basis of bond values in the face of a $3,400,000,000 government issue . " There will be hundreds and hundreds of bank failures , small bank failures , throughout the United States , " he added . " We would have a grand and glorious inflation . The indications tonight were that the measure which the Senate Finance Committee will probably agree to report tomorrow will be along the lines of the Barkley bill , proposing payment of 100 per cent value of the adjusted compensation certificates to former service men . It Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House by Representative Patman of Texas that the estimate of $3,400 , - , 000,000 as to probable cost was made by Secretary Mellon . Mr. Patman said tonight that while efforts for a compromise had been made from time to time , he , for one , would accept nothing less than a measure giving the full value of the certificates to the veterans . One of the compromise plans was introduced by Senator Vandenberg of Michigan several weeks ago and provides for increasing the loan value of the certificates to 50 per cent instead of 22 per cent as at present , and for reducing the rate of interest on veterans ' loans . Senator Vandenberg encouraged the advocates of this plan when , after a recent visit to the White House , he intimated his belief that President Hoover would accept it . House Committee Hears Warning . The Ways and Means Committee also was warned that a demoralized bond market and the further depression of values of collateral securities would follow cash bonus legislation in the form proposed . E. C. Wagner , president of the Discount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government securities in the country , stated that holders of Federal bonds , including the Liberty Loans , had suffered a book value loss of $163,000,000 as a result of the decline last week , ascribed to proceedings in Congress . He said further demoralization would certainly follow definite progress toward passage of the pending legislation . The Senate Finance Committee will meet tomorrow in executive session for the first time since hearing testimony on cash bonus legislation last week . Administration &lowers; concede that advocates of the measure probably have enough votes to order a favorable report . Administration leaders opposed to the plan have invited a number of outstanding business and financial leaders , including Alfred P. Sloan , president of General Motors , and Owen D. Young , chairman of the board of the General Electric Company , to appear before the Ways and Means Committee as witnqsses . Mr. Sloan has been asked to Appear tomorrow with H. W. George of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company , E. D. Duffield of Newark , president of the Prudential Life Insurance Company ; Clarence W. Woolley of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Taylor . Mr. Young has been invited to appear Wednesday . Mr. Mitchell made his statement while testifying before the Glass subcommittee in regard to banking and securities problems . He said further that any such bonds as those of the proposed $3,400,000,000 issue would " have to have all the advantages of government bonds , plus . " With such an issue in the field , he continued , prior government bonds would be forced down in price until they were selling to yield rj , .1 to 1 per cent higher than at present . Mimicipal . State and industrial bonds would show even greater declines . Mr. Wagner 's Views . Mr. Wagner was one of three bankers and bond dealers to appear before the Ways and Means Committee , the others being Arthur Reynolds . chairman of the board of the Continental Illinois Bank and Trust Company of Chicago , and George J. Schaller , banker of Storm Lake , Iowa . The latter two also testified that a new government issue of the magnitude suggested by pending bonus bills would drive down securities values , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country . Philip A. Benson , treasurer of the Dime Savings Bank of Brooklyn and a representative of the National Association of Mutual Savings Banks , asserted that a large bond issue for a cash bonus or any other purpose would depress the value of government securities held by savings banks as liquid collateral against their deposits . making them more vulnerable to large withdrawals . As a representative of the association he protested against the " staggering blow to the financial structure of the country " that would result from the proposed legislation . Mr. Weenier began by saying that not only had Federal securities sagged in value , but that , in all probability , corporate issues were being held up because of uncertainty created by the cash bonus situation . NUNN fgrau.laistioilaellk rglr24440. public utilities . amounting to more than $800,000,000 , were pending . " A substantial part of the proceeds from these bonds , " he said , " would be expended in New York , but as long as the present uncertainty in the bond market continues , these issues must be held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced in the second half of 1930 , and particularly in the final months of the year , one of the most violent declines of all time . In many cases it was most difficult - to find buyers for bonds of a quality below the higher grades which were thrown on the market . Says Market Is Frozen . The government security market stood up remarkably well during this period , he went on , because banks and others were primarily interested in safety , but fresh issues or bonds of other sorts could not have been placed . It was in this highly sensitive situation that the market entered the new year . Since Jan. 1 there had been encouraging signs . In the main , new issues met with favorable reception and prices had some recovery . " Since the publicity on the proposal to pay at once the adjusted service certificates to World War veterans , this whole picture has , changed , " he continued . " Prices of United States Government long-time bonds have declined an average of nearly 3 points on the higher coupon bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Reynolds said banks had no such organization to sell $3,400,000 , - 000 in new bonds as it had in the Liberty Loan days . The rate of interest would have to be so high as to attract buyers and when the rate was pushed to that point it would have a depressing effect upon outstanding bonds . Such money as went into the new bonds would have to come from corporate treasuries and from funds meant for improvements that would give more employment for a general revival of business . " A cash bonus will later do more evil than it will do good now . It is like a hypodermic of strychnine given to a sick person . It may have good effects for the present , but will likely turn out to be harmful after the good effects wear away . " Mr. Mitchell on Bank Problems . A uniform banking system with considerably higher liquid reserve requirements than the various State and national laws now demand would be the surest preventive of bank failures , Mr. Mitchell told the Senate subcommittee . He termed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our day . " A director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , he agreed with the recent testimony of George R. Harrison , governor of that bank , that the raising of the rediscount rate in time would have forestalled the stock market crash of 1929 . He also agreed , in principle , with Mr. Harrison 's opinion that it is difficult , if not impossible , to draw a fine line of difference between commercial and security loans by banks in the conduct of the Federal Reserve Bank 's rediscount business . The capital gains tax , he said , encouraged inflation and , when the - 044- 4 .44 ? 444 444 *-1144 rapid deflation . As head of a bank which operates numerous branches in New York City , he favored branch banking in limited areas but opposed it in large areas where the central directing authority may not be in close touch with conditions surrounding each of the branches . Absence of Liquid Reserves . Replying to a question asked by H. Parker Willis , banking expert for the subcommittee , Mr. Mitchell said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banking difficulties come from the absence of liquidity In bank reserves . I think the idea developed that when the law set up what is called a reserve that is adequate for the protection of depositors , small banks , especially , think that this is sufficient . " As a matter of fact , there is not a bank in this country that is good if it is operating on that basis of liquid reserve . I think if the reserve was 25 per cent there would be few failures and if we could have such a uniform system there would not need to be so much discussion of the merits of various types of banking . " Unfortunately such a system can not be instituted through the Federal Reserve System , as we have no means of forcing banks into the Federal Reserve and making them stay there , where they belong . " The crash of 1929 , he thought , was due to a large extent to " maldistribution of gold and maladjustment of business and commerce by the war , " as well as inflation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessity for creation of debts during the war . " Loans by corporations outside of the banking fold during the speculative period he held " particularly unfortunate . " " It was equally unfortunate , " he added , " that the great volume of loans was not considered as a part of the credit structure . If it had been , we would have realized how great was the inflation of credit and we could have taken steps to correct the enormous inflation . Senator Glass asked Mr. Mitchell if he thought the Federal Reserve act authorized the use of the rediscount rate " to penalize commerce for the express purpose of restraining the stock market ? " ' If I had to answer yes or no , I 'd sa ? no , " responded Mr. Mitchell , " but this borrowing on securities does enter into the picture and the reflection of that has a grave effect on commerce and industry . " Senator Glass expressed the belief that some banks had taken advantage of rediscounting privileges on commercial paper to make security or call loans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone quite that far . A New York bank always has in its portfolio a large volume of street call loans . They are the most liquid of assets and , so far as I know , no loss ever occurred from them . In my own bank I am never quite happy unless we have about $100 , - 000,000 of street demand loans . They are a cushion in times of stress . " Opposes Capital Gains Tax . When Mr. Mitchell said the reserves of the Reserve banks are so far above the legal requirements that they have ceased to be a factor in the rediscount rate , Senator Glass might well be raised to " put a brake on expansion of the credit structure . " Mr. Mitchell said he knew of no way to eliminate loans made by banks for the account of business houses . He considered a legal limitation on loans to member banks by Federal Reserve banks to limit speculative loans " would be an unnecessary prohibition and work a hardship . " He recommended the gradual elimination of the capital gains tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make themselves liable to the tax on profits while in a falling market they rushed in to sell and take a loss which would enable them to save the tax . " If a man can take his profits without a break and take his losses in the same way I think there will be greater mobility of capital and the government get its returns in the same measure , " he added . Mr. Mitchell explained that his bank had a security affiliate , the National City Company , and a trust company and an international banking organization as the connected enterprises . The stock of the security affiliate was " held in a trusteeship for the benefit ' of our shareholders , " numbering approximately 69,000 . The bank seldom bought securities from its affiliate , but frequently " used its trading facilities to buy stocks of securities for the bank 's folio . " " For our trust accounts , " he added , " we have a fixed rule against buying from our security affiliate . " Asked whether the security affiliate was a large buyer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it " carries an account to ? take the peaks out of an advancing or declining market , " but does not operate in these stocks ordinarily and does not buy the bank 's stock for permanent investment . He believed simultaneous examination of an affiliate 's books with those of the bank should be legally required but was opposed to having statements t4 ' an affiliate 's operations published more frequently than once a year . " That would be very disadvantageous to a bank affiliate , as against private banks with whom the bank affiliates ars In direct competition , " he explained . He recommended that the Controller of the Currency or a similar official have discretionary powers in watching affiliates , rather than having them strictly regulated by prohibitory legislation . A restriction which he favored was that a bank 's trust company be definitely prohibited from buying securities from the affiliate of that bank . As for the number of affiliates a bank might have , he thought it might possess " as many as there is a good sound reason for . " Stressing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think we need to drive all of the banks into the Federal Reserve System . I - think that from the standpoint of the public good anything would be justifiable to bring that about . " Asked for opinion on the failure of  --  the Bank of United States in New York City , he replied : " That is a case of distinctly bad bankin , and there is zw way ; irk
