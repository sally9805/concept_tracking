Even schoolboys know that birds mate in the spring , but even a bright schoolboy could hardly tell why . Biologist James C. Perry of Cincinnati 's Xavier University , no schoolboy by a long shot , was convinced last week that it is not so much the flowers that bloom in the spring as what birds eat that affects their mating cycle . Other investigators had advanced the theory that increased exposure to sunlight in the spring is the sex stimulus . This theory they checked experimentally by inducing sex gland activity with artificial illumination . It looked as if the light stimulated the front lobe of the pituitary ( " master gland " ) , which in turn roused the gonads . <P> In his laboratory Dr. Perry induced unseasonable sex activity by shining ordinary 25-watt lamps on sparrows much less than a year old . The beaks of the males turned dark and their testes developed spermatozoa ; the ovaries of the females were swollen , contained numerous eggs . The scientist evoked even more pronounced gland changes with ultraviolet light . <P> Though some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Perry was not convinced that it was a case of cause and effect . Perhaps , he reasoned , the radiation first altered some factor in the diet , which then stimulated the pituitary and through it the sex mechanism . With this hypothesis in mind . Perry irradiated whole-wheat grains with ultraviolet light , fed them to his birds . That did the trick , whereas the sex glands of other birds which received the same ( normal ) illumination , but did not eat the irradiated , aphrodisiac wheat , remained in the " resting condition . " <P> In the Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine , Dr. Perry concluded : " This interpretation , which . . . shifts the emphasis from light affecting the animal to light producing a change in the diet , may well apply to the seasonal sexual development of other vertebrates as well. * The results . . . point to an increase of Vitamin D or some kindred substance as the specific dietary factor .
