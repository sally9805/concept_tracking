One evening last week a party of Navy folk gathered at an obscure Chinese restaurant in Honolulu 's Waikiki section where good chop suey is to be had . Full of good spirits , they sat around eating , laughing , talking , making merry . Centre of the group was Lieut . Thomas Hedges Massie , with his mother-in-law , Mrs. Granville Roland Fortescue . Thalia Fortescue Massie , his wife , was also there . About them they had assembled Navy friends for a celebration because for the first time in four months Lieut . Massie and Mrs. Fortescue , with Seamen Jones and Lord , were once again legally free . Their sentences for the killing of Joseph Kahahawai Jr . had been duly served . <P> At 10 o'clock that morning the four defendants , whom a polyglot jury had convicted of manslaughter instead of second-degree murder , were led into the Honolulu courtroom where they had sat through their three-week trial . Mounting the bench Judge Charles S. Davis pronounced his sentence : " Ten years imprisonment at hard labor . " * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Fortescue almost pranced she was so happy . The two enlisted men were as jaunty as ever . They all knew what was coming . <P> After the judge 's departure everyone stood around in the courtroom chatting easily while High Sheriff Gordon Ross guarded his prisoners . Soon the four " convicts " were herded across the sunny street to Iolani Palace , once the home of Hawaiian Kings , now the office of the territorial governor . There they sat waiting in a high-ceiled , red-carpeted inner room for a few minutes more . <P> " This is a swell jail ! " remarked Seaman Jones . " A lot better than Al Capone 's . " <P> At , exactly 11 a.m. all four prisoners were ushered down a hall and into the office of Governor Lawrence McCully Judd . To each he handed a paper commuting their sentences to the time already served . By telescoping ten years into one hour the Kahahawai case was thus closed with one final dramatic fillip . <P> " I wish I could be in Kentucky right now to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm free ! " exclaimed Lieut . Massie after hugging his wife and kissing his mother-in-law . Mrs. Massie was " thrilled " at the outcome . Mrs. Fortescue , almost weeping with delight , rushed off a message to her husband while Seaman Jones cabled his mother in New Bedford , Mass. : " Will be home soon . Keep the coffee hot . " Clarence Darrow , defense counsel , beamed satisfaction , shook hands all around . <P> The commutations from Governor Judd , island-born son of an island-born son of a Yankee missionary , did not come spontaneously . Defense counsel had formally petitioned him for executive clemency but more potent was the pressure of mainland sentiment . In Washington Congress had seethed with legislative proposals to set the convictions aside . No less than 104 Congressmen had signed a cabled plea to Governor Judd to pardon the four prisoners . Victor Steuart Kaleoaloha Houston , Hawaiian delegate in Congress , aware of the rising political tide against his territory , likewise begged the Governor . <P>          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
