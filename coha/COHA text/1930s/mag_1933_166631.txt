Hamilton Holt , beetle-browed onetime editor of the Independent , became president of Rollins College in Winter Park , Fla. in 1925 and has since made it noted , by some estimates , for fuddling eccentricity , and by others , for pleasant liberality .

With him he had a complaisant board of trustees , save for Mrs. Raymond Robins , Florida bookshop proprietor and wife of Herbert Hoover 's reformer friend who disappeared with amnesia for some weeks last year ( TIME , Sept. 19 et Seq . ) She hastened to Winter Park to see that her nephew , Professor Theodore Dreier , was not booted out with the others . <P> <P> <P> <P> *The total cost of running Rollins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of students .
