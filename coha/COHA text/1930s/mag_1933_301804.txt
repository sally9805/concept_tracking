Democratic Sin <P> Sirs : <P> TIME , in its issue of Jan. 30 , states the Congress " adopted a resolution by Pennsylvania 's Cochran to void President Hoover 's eleven orders for Government consolidation . " <P> Be advised that this sin rests upon the conscience of Missouri 's Cochran , a Democrat . <P> I opposed the resolution , believing we should achieve at once the economies to result from the consolidation of various governmental bureaus and commissions . <P> T. C. COCHRAN <P> Congress of the United States <P> House of Representatives <P> Washington , D.

Army radio <P> Washington , D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger generation down here , steeped in the glory of the Old South and fired with the possibilities of her future , have been taught to speak of the fighting between 1861 and 1865 as the Confederate War or the War Between the States . <P> I see you invariably refer to it as the Civil War . a term we have been taught to avoid , but one which most people employ ; even most Southerners . <P> Our reason is. of course , obvious : We dislike the thought of having rebelled , though it is perhaps true . <P> On what do you base your choice of " Civil War " rather than one of these others ? <P> FANNING MILES HEARON <P> Lynchburg , Va . <P> " Civil War " is brief , accurate. - ED . <P> Specialist <P> Sirs : <P> Your mention of the Indian climbing perch is interesting but inaccurate ( TIME . Feb. 6 ) . People , including scientists , ' ' know " why it wants to go overland as well as they know countless other facts about fauna . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the climbing perch is a specialist . Living in hot , often foul , water holes , it has developed a sort of auxiliary " lung " ( labyrinth ) that enables it to utilize atmospheric air instead of the oxygen in the water , which is too low under such conditions to sustain piscatorial life . <P> When the water hole dries up , it is able to wriggle or " walk " overland to another body of water , is aided in doing this by unusually stiff , spiny pectoral fins . <P> From the 18th Century until just recently ( c. 1951 ) even ichthyologists believed this fish climbed trees . The new explanation ( v. John Roxbrough Norman 's History of Fishes , published 1931 ) is parallel to that of the catfish incident : that birds seized them as they wriggled along on the ground , and placed them in crotches of trees possibly for future use . <P> Most aquarists and tropical fans are familiar with Anabas and many other labyrinthine fishes that are favorites among the 600-odd small tropical fishes being imported for home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same family . <P> LESTER L.
