txt Social Security Legislation A regrettable deadlock has developed in the New York State Legislature between the Senate and the Assembly over Governor-Lehman 's eight-point social security program . The Senate has adopted the Dunnigan bill to give legislative sanction to the Governor 's recommendations , and the Assembly 's public relief and welfare committee killed the companion bill and offered a substitute . Unless some form of compromise is effected , the 1936 social security program is doomed , and with it great loss to the State from Federal funds . The deadlock has held up the revision of New York 's old-age-assistance laws , with a threatened loss in revenue from Federal funds to the State of $536,000 if the Legislature fails to bring New York State laws in agreement with Federal social security statutes before April 1 . New York City 's loss will be $268,000 . EDWARD C. RYBICKI . New York , March 27. 1936.
