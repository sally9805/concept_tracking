txt West Point Postoffice Efficient . To the Editor of The New York Times : May I correct a misstatement " in and add to your article " Efficient Air Mail Service " ? The package of air mail letters dropped at West Point on July 25 by Major Doolittle landed at the feet of one of the Military Police , was picked up immediately and was in the hands of the postoffice force within fifteen minutes . I received it myself , and the letters were ready for the outgoing mail half an hour from the time they were dropped . Our last mail leaves here about 5 P. M. , and Major Doolittle arrived at 8:55 P. M. , which is the reason the letters left here on the first mail Tuesday morning . West Point was right on the job  --  got the mail when dropped , and the date received was stamped on the back of each letter . G. A. HARRINGTON , Postmaster . West Point N. Y. , Aug. 2 , 1932. ?          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
