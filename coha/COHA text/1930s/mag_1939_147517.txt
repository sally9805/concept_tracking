In the Villa , a house at the $13,000,000 Seminary of St. Mary 's of the Lake in Mundelein , Ill. , late last Sunday afternoon , two cassocked churchmen worked over the draft of a speech . One was Most Rev. Bernard James Sheil , Auxiliary bishop of Chicago , good friend of labor , good friend of youth , founder of the Catholic Youth Organization . The other was the godfather of the town , His Eminence George William Cardinal Mundelein , Archbishop of Chicago , great liberal of the Church , great builder and money-raiser for the sprawling archdiocese he had headed for nearly a quarter of a century . The speech over which they worked was to be delivered next evening at a C. Y. O. convention in Cincinnati . Bishop Sheil was to speak it , but it represented the thoughts of Cardinal Mundelein . His thoughts were of war &; peace . <P> With alarm the Cardinal perceived that great masses of citizens both Catholic and Protestant were being stirred on the neutrality issue by the persuasive baritone of Royal Oak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mundelein had crossed swords publicly in the past . The Cardinal knew that the Vatican , neutral in the War , was concerned about U. S. neutrality . Bishop Sheil had just returned from a visit to Rome , had hotfooted to Washington for a two-hour lunch in the White House . It then became known that his C. Y. 0 . speech would be broadcast and that it would uphold the Administration , denounce Father Coughlin . <P> The draft of the speech approved , Cardinal Mundelein dined , meditated , went to bed . Next morning , a secretary entered the Cardinal 's bedchamber to awaken him for his devotions . But in his sleep , heart disease had brought death , as to all men , to George William Mundelein , 67 . <P> Chicago had loved Cardinal Mundelein ever since it gasped , one morning in 1916 , to learn that , at the first public dinner given for him , an anarchist cook had poisoned the soup , laid most of the 300 guests low-but not the new Archbishop . <P> When he returned from Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to welcome ' him . And on each of two later occasions-an international Eucharistic Congress in 1926 , a celebration in 1034 of his 25th anniversary as bishop-1,000,000 people joined him in public acts of devotion . <P> In the sorrow and confusion after the death of the West 's first Prince of the Church , Bishop Sheil had a quick decision to make-whether or not to cancel his speech . In a stroke of astute churchmanship , he resolved to deliver it as Cardinal Mundelein 's political and ecclesiastical testament , a summing up of the liberal views which had made the Cardinal a personal friend of President Roosevelt and a public friend of the New Deal . <P> To the C. Y. 0 . and the U. S. , Bishop Sheil said : " What he Cardinal Mundelein authorized me to say was controversial-something he would not have wanted to have said for him-except that he felt that others had created a situation which might be mistaken to compromise the position of the Catholic clergy toward the Congress of the United States , and toward his great friend and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom and experience , and is a positive impediment to our democratic process , deliberately to bludgeon Senators and Congressmen with letters and telegrams which can only be counted and not read . . . .
