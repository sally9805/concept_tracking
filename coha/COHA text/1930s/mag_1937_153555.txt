As the annual summer epidemic of infantile paralysis was about to break upon the country last week , expert prophylactic teams deployed over the nation to prevent it by spraying the noses of children with zinc sulphate . This is a new but thoroughly tested method of preventing a disease which has crippled thousands of people of the U. S. , including the President . <P> Overtures to this preventive campaign appeared in last week 's Journal of the American Medical Association . Bacteriologist Edwin William Schultz of Stanford University recalled Medicine 's halting ; progress against infantile paralysis . Serum from the blood of people who suffered from the disease failed to immunize children . Vaccines made from the spines of infected monkeys failed . <P> Presuming that the virus entered the body only through the nerves of smell , Epidemiologist Charles Armstrong of the U. S. Public Health Service , tried coating the tips of those nerves with spray containing alum . This procedure protected some children exposed to the disease but not all . <P> Dr. Max Minor Peet , ebullient neurosurgeon of the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Armstrong , found that the occasional failures were due to faulty spraying . While he , with Assistants Dean H. Echols and Harry J. Richter experimented on methods of completely covering the olfactory nerve ends , Dr. Schultz , with help of Chemist L. P. Gebhardt , sought chemicals which might be more effective than alum . They decided on a solution of 1% zinc sulphate , 0.5% sodium chloride and 1% pontocaine , hydrochloride ( a local anesthetic ) in distilled water . <P> Last week Dr. Peet prescribed the method of administering this : " The subject is seated and an attendant holds the head tilted backward about 45 . This is the usual position for a nasal examination . A speculum is introduced into the nostril and under direct vision the spray tip is inserted upward along the septum until definitely past the middle turbinate . If it impinges on the roof of the nose it is slightly withdrawn . The bulb is squeezed the number of times required to introduce ice . of solution . This amount completely covers the olfactory area . A similar procedure is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> The zinc sulphate spraying should be repeated for three consecutive days , then once every two weeks while danger of infantile paralysis prevails in the community . The treatment destroys the sense of smell for a few days and may cause headaches , but is otherwise undisturbing . <P> Prophylactic teams , each composed of a specially trained doctor , a nurse and a clerk , will work under Dr. Armstrong 's general supervision . They started in the South where infantile first breaks out each summer and will rapidly work north . <P> Dr. Schultz last week took pains to warn : " The application of a prophylactic measure such as this must be kept entirely in the hands of those who are fully competent to apply it properly . It is not a prophylactic measure which can be turned over to the public for self administration . "
