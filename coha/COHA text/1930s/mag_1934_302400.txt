For sentimental and legal reasons , tiny Penzance was chosen for the first performance of The Pirates of Penzance . Cairo got the opening of Aida to christen its new opera house . For no particular reason at all , Dallas , Tex . was the scene last week of a world premiere of a play by George Bernard Shaw . <P> Village Wooing , " A comediettina for two voices " in three " conversations , " lasts less than an hour , has two characters , A and Z. A is a misanthropic author who meets Z , a country telephone operator and general store salesgirl , on a world cruise . Against his will , by reason of her commonsense and persistence , she marries him when they are later thrown together in her village store . With no vestige of a Cause at stake , Playwright Shaw has contented himself with assembling snatches of agreeable small talk . A snatch not so agreeable : <P> Z : My father used to say that men and women are always driving one another mad . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of letters ? <P> Z : Yes : I should think he was . A postman . <P> Not often does Dallas see a premiere , let alone one by the Sage of Adelphi Terrace , whose U.S. representatives , the Theatre Guild , had sanctioned the performance . Nevertheless , Dallas ' critical fraternity rose magnificently to the occasion . Observed Critic John Rosenfield Jr . of the Morning News : <P> " Village Wooing succeeded to a degree that will discomfit the author if he ever hears about it . The Dallas Little Theatre audience . . . blithely unimpressed by its history-making function , laughed often and loudly at the Immortal 's casual scherzo and damned it as the most pleasant entertainment on the precincts since Ten Nights in a Bar Room . . . . <P> " It is hard to tell what Shaw meant by Village Wooing , as he did not vouchsafe an explanatory preface . You are free to surmise many things : that he sought to show up the smart-talk writers from Maugham through Lonsdale , Coward and Milne ; to beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Woolley ' s performance . . . was practically perfect of its kind . . . . There is now a conception and a tradition to the part of ' Z ' that well may be standard . . . . Mr. Meredith generously permitted his colleague to take all the tricks . ... He was to her what Georgie Burns is to Gracie Allen . . . . "
