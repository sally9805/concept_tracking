Despite the best endeavors of a small group of tough , skillful , highly-paid young men , the city of Boston has never been persuaded to take professional football very seriously . Last year in Detroit , where some 20,000 people were willing to pay up to $3.30 every week out of sheer delight in professional football , the Detroit Lions finished third among the four teams in the National League 's Western Division . Meanwhile , in Boston , even when George Preston Marshall 's Redskins dramatically won the championship of the Eastern Division , Bostonians remained apathetic . This year disgusted Mr. Marshall pulled his football team up from Boston by the roots , transplanted it to Washington . <P> There the Redskins have prospered . More people watched their first three home games this year than watched all their games last year . A good reason for this interest is George Preston Marshall , who is not new to Washington . Some 50 blue- gold Palace Laundries ( " Long Live Linen ' ' ) on Washington street corners wash enough of Washington 's starched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his sporting activities and his spectacular private life . For a brief blazing period he was publisher of Hearst 's Washington Times . Even before that , he was taken up by amused Washington socialites to whom on every social occasion he recalled the fact that he did their laundry . <P> This Year 's Hero . Another reason for the Redskins ' current popularity is a young man named Sammy Baugh . Last year , a senior at Texas Christian , he was named All-America quarterback . Somewhere in his career a particularly idiotic sportswriter named him " Slingin ' Sam " because he threw a football as easily and as accurately as a baseballer throws a baseball . Slingin ' Sam 's nickname has this year been a double asset . Not only does it fit snugly into headlines , but sports-reading opponents , who always expect a pass whenever Sam Baugh has the ball , are disconcerted to find that Sam Baugh is as capable a runner and kicker as he is a passer . In the six games so far this season 53 of Sam Baugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yd . His running record is almost as impressive . Versatile Sam Baugh is the main reason why the Redskins are now only half a game behind the powerful Giants , why in mid-December they may possibly meet the champions of the Western Division-likely to be the Chicago Bears or the Green Bay Packers-for the National League championship .
