In Cleveland Artur Rodzinski thrust his baton into the air last week , scurried through the sparkling overture to Strauss 's Der Rosenkavalier and the curtain was up on a performance made memorable by Soprano Lotte Lehmann as the wistful , aging Princess . <P> In St. Louis , 6,000 people pushed their way into the huge new Convention Hall to hear Maria Jeritza in Puccini 's Turandot . <P> In San Francisco talk was all of Wagner 's Ring cycle which opened the season there last week ( TIME , Nov. 4 ) . <P> In the big Chicago opera house handsome Basso Ezio Pinza made a suave , red-clawed devil in Boito 's Mefistofele . The Marguerite was Soprano Edith Mason , oldtime Chicago favorite . Dominant behind the scenes was Italian Paul Longone , with the title of " General Manager . " <P> It has been a stiff battle to give Chicago opera since the Samuel Insull fiasco in the spring of 1932 . Following winter there was no one to pick up the pieces and the house stayed dark . Then up popped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise money . Backers for the first reorganized season were Continental Illinois National Bank &; Trust Co. which controls the building , scenery , lights ; the late George Lytton ( Hub clothing store ) ; Banker George Woodruff ; Lawyer George Haight ; Harold Fowler McCormick. who is always a willing patron for opera in Chicago . Deficit that first season was only $12,000 . Last year it ran up to $78,000 , discouraged everyone but irrepressible Paul Longone . Lawyer Haight announced then that times were unpropitious to undertake another season , withdrew a large part of the support and the name " Chicago Grand Opera . " Forthwith Longone went out for new backers , won the help of Mayor Edward Joseph Kelly , renamed the organization the Chicago City Opera . <P> Drawback to Chicago 's present arrangement is the short ( five-week ) season which makes it impossible to maintain a creditable resident company . Makeshift is to pay for a few big names to bolster up a list of mediocres . For his trump cards this season Longone will present Lehmann in Der Rosenkavalier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty Helen Jepson as the profligate Thais , the U. S. premiere of Respighi 's La Fiamma , the world premiere of Ethel Leginska 's Gale with John Charles Thomas singing and the bushy-haired composer conducting .
