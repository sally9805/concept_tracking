His twisted features toneless as grey clay , a middle-aged Brooklyn man last week doubled up with such pain in his abdomen that his tousled head banged his knees . For a multitude of similar sufferers from cancer of abdominal organs the only anodyne is morphine . <P> The pain-contorted Brooklyn man was a patient of Anesthetist Marius Bohdan Greene . Taking him into an aseptic operating room , he gently rolled the patient on his side , rolled up the bed shirt , injected into the spine a mixture of alcohol chloroform , acetone and cobra venom . The tortured man unbent . Faint color flooded his face . He opened his eyes . <P> And Dr. Greene hastened away to catch a train for Ottawa , where he was scheduled to tell the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( see p. 20 ) about his new pain interceptor . <P> According to his theory , injury to any part of the body also injures local nerves and sends messages of pain to the brain to protect the injured part . The brain sends messages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the site of injury . A hurt fist will clench , a face twist , a foot limp . These messages may accumulate if the injury is very great or persistent . This accumulation of nerve impulses may itself irritate nerves , causing useless and damaging excess pain . <P> The venom ( Dr. Greene also uses extracts from bees , lizards and salamanders ) in combination with the other ingredients of his spinal injection interrupts the nervous circulation of pain . This it does by paralyzing efferent motor nerves ( which carry commands from the brain ) just where they branch from the spinal cord . For lack of orders from the brain to do something , the injured part relaxes , does nothing . This gives injured local nerves opportunity to heal and to help the injured muscles which they serve , to heal also . Dr. Greene finds his anodyne an aid in the treatment of back injuries , sciatica and shaking palsy . In cases of inoperable cancer the patient has opportunity to die in peace .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
