Ladies and Gentlemen ( by Charles MacArthur and Ben Hecht , from a play by Ladislaus Bush-Fekete ; produced by Gilbert Miller ) . Decade ago the late Minnie Maddern Fiske huffed , barked , flounced her way through a typical virtuoso 's vehicle , Ladies of the Jury . Hungarian Ladislaus Bush-Fekete ( n Bus-Fekete : the " h " was his idea of Americanizing the name ) made a play with the same situation-a resourceful woman swinging the rest of a jury around from a verdict of guilty to acquittal in a murder case . <P> As translated , and practically rewritten , by Hecht and MacArthur ( The Front Page , 20th Century ) , Ladies and Gentlemen gives Helen Hayes ( Mrs. MacArthur ) her first new play after three years and 969 performances of Victoria Regina . She was glad to escape from that " rarefied atmosphere , " says she , " because I am fearful of becoming the centre of a cult . " Ladies and Gentlemen , after opening in Santa Barbara , last week started a month 's tryout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles . Miss Hayes said her husband felt that , if she must play in his piece , it had better begin as far from Broadway as possible . <P> Co-star with Helen Hayes is Herbert Marshall ; he , a frustrated architect ; she , a cinemagnate 's secretary . As she cajoles a jury into acquitting a man accused of killing his wife because he loves another , she falls in love with Marshall , a juror . As San Francisco saw Ladies and Gentlemen , the final curtain brought renunciation . Instead of going away with the secretary , the architect made ready to send his son to Europe , " in search of my lost youth . " But the play had a bad case of third-act anemia , for which the authors last week were preparing transfusions . Ladies and Gentlemen pleased San Francisco , may make good box-office on Broadway because of : 1 ) its stars , 2 ) its Hecht-MacArthur gags .
