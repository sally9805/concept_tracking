GRAHAM OF CLAVERHOUSE-Constance W. Dodge-Co-old Friede ( $2.50 ) . <P> His real name was John Graham of Claverhouse , but the muttering Scottish Covenanters pronounced it " Bluidy Clavers . " A gentleman , a hard-bitten soldier , Clavers had come back to Scotland from the Low Countries to see his dying mother , and at her behest stayed on to serve Charles II . His inglorious job was to uphold the unpopular Established Church , put down the dissenting Covenanters with a heavy hand . A misogynist , Clavers was faithful only to his duty . Nearly everyone hated him . <P> Local opinion of him became practically unanimous when hot-tempered Jean , who had no love for the canting Covenanters and was much drawn to Clavers ' dark good looks , saw him superintending a bloody flogging . That night , when they met at a ball , she publicly insulted him . ' But it was all a terrible mistake . The man she had seen flogged was one of Clavers ' own brutal troopers who had been caught torturing Jean 's old nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , apologized to Clavers as publicly as she had insulted him . By page 120 there seems no further reason to worry about the course of their love affair . <P> But meantime Clavers has had a recruit - towering Alastair Maclan , a proud , penurious Highlander plagued with second sight . And when Alastair went into one of his trances he saw rocks ahead . In his waking moments he ably seconded Clavers in his police duties , wooed Margaret , Jean 's protegee . Margaret liked Alastair but could not do better than that : seeing her father murdered had been a shock that left her pathologically virginal . Clavers married his Jean but Alastair pined in vain for Margaret . <P> When weak , unpopular James II came to the throne , the whip hand passed from Clavers ' party to the Covenanters . James skedaddled and William of Orange took his place . William was Clavers ' old commander but the Stuarts were still his liege lords , so he and Alastair left home , rode north to raise the clans . Leading his Highlandmen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shot from behind by a silver bullet . With the death of their leader the Stuart cause collapsed . <P> Alastair avenged his friend 's murder , and by doing it shocked Margaret ( who was just emerging from her pathological state ) for what looked like keeps . So he went back to his craggy home to live like a hermit . Smoked out by treacherous government soldiers , he decided to go to America . On the ship whom should he see but Margaret . This time the shock was pleasant for both parties . <P> Author Dodge has based her romantic tale on a rubble foundation of fact . Claverhouse was a real character who , she thinks , has been handled over roughly by historians . As raw material for the cinema , Graham of Claverhouse is magnificent stuff . As a book , it is cloak- &-sword; romance , Grade B.
