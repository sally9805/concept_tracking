Walter Bowes is 56 , Walter H. Wheeler Jr. , 42 . Walter Bowes is nervous , restless ; he hates a desk and office hours , prefers to putter about his home . Walter Wheeler is the reverse , has steady nerves and a passion for detail , likes to organize . One thing this antipodal pair have in common is a love of sailing . In 1929 Yachtsman Bowes sailed his six-meter Saleema to an international championship . In 1938 Yachtsman Wheeler won the Astor cup with his Q class Cottonblossom II . Messrs . Bowes and Wheeler have still another thing in common , their business-Pitney-Bowes Postage Meter Co. of Stamford , Conn . Chairman Bowes invents the meters and President Wheeler sells them . Last week they presented their slickest postage meter to date , the " Mailomat . " <P> Unveiled in Manhattan 's General Post Office , the Mailomat is about the size of a telephone booth , performs a similar service . You put your money in one slot , your letter in another , push a lever and the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no licking ) and speed ( no waiting at a post office window , no need for the letter to be canceled ) . <P> The Mailomat , whose price to the Government , or rental to industry , is still unfixed , is a development of the postage meter Walter Bowes persuaded the Post Office to try in 1920 , year after he and the late Arthur Pitney formed Pitney-Bowes . Since then use of postage meters has risen until they now provide the U. S. Government with 16% of its annual postage revenue . Practically every big U. S. company has either rented or bought a Pitney-Bowes machine to speed up its mailing . Pitney-Bowes profits meanwhile have risen to $614,791 in 1937 , $586,416 last year . Its stock , traded on the Curb , was only at $7.25 last week , but Founder Bowes has enough so that the annual 50-per-share dividend enables him to indulge another expensive hobby besides yachting-a stud farm in Virginia .
