Bostonians closed their eyes and doubted their ears last week . Reporters rushed backstage where the hero of the afternoon , excited by his ovation , said : " Look ! I can tie my own four-in-hand , too ! " <P> Paul Wittgenstein , famed one-armed Austrian pianist , had made his U. S. debut with the Boston Symphony , playing a Concerto especially composed for him by Maurice Ravel . Bostonians closed their eyes because it seemed incredible that a single left hand could compass a keyboard so quickly and completely , make the treble sound clear and strong while the bass poured out a seething undercurrent . Compared with most pianists , Paul Wittgenstein has a fairly small hand . His trick was to train it to lightning speed , to develop his pedal technique so that he could cover transitions gracefully and subtly , give a solid , two-handed effect . <P> Wittgenstein was once a prize pupil of the Master Leschitizky who taught Paderewski . In those days he had two hands . Year after his Viennese debut came the War . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the way to the Russian frontier his right arm was wounded . He lost consciousness , woke up to find himself in a Russian prison camp . He was shunted about behind the lines , spent six months in Siberia before his group was exchanged for Russian prisoners in Austria . <P> Minus one hand , his musical career seemed ended . But music obsessed him and he discovered that he could still do wonderful things with his left hand . A year later he gave his second Vienna concert and his prestige spread throughout Europe . Since then Leopold Godowsky and Moritz Rosenthal have made many of his arrangements . Besides last week 's Concerto , original music has been written for him by Erich Korngold , Sergei Prokofief , Richard Strauss .
