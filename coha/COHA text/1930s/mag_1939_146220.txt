When William Woodward 's Johnstown won the Kentucky Derby by six lengths last fortnight , horse-racing fans hailed an-other Man o ' War . Turf experts reserved their opinions . They wanted to see long-striding Johnstown run in the mud , something he had not been asked to do this year . Last week there was lots of mud for the Preakness , second of the Big Three U. S. races for three-year-olds . So convinced of Big John 's prowess were rival owners that only five were willing to risk the $500 starting fee ( day before ) to match their hopefuls against the Woodward colt . <P> Big John , coupled in the betting with Mrs. Henry Carnegie Phipps 's Gilded Knight , * was still an overwhelming favorite-despite the mud-when 30,000 horse-enthusiasts crammed the mid-Victorian stands at historic old Pimlico , on the outskirts of Baltimore , for the 49th running of the Preakness Stakes . Second choice was Challedon , who had finished second to Big John in the Derby and was reputed to like sloppy going . <P> Through a grey drizzle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as expected .

Coming into the homestretch , Challedon , who had been trailing the leaders , flew past them in a splatter of mud , crossed the finish line a length and a half-in front of Gilded Knight . Mighty Johnstown , with mud in his eye , strolled in next to last , almost ear to ear with last-place Ciencia , only filly in the race . <P> As the band played Maryland , My Maryland , Challedon and his owner , William L. Brann , standing in the winner 's circle , received one of the loudest ovations in the history of 68-year-old Pimlico . For Challedon , foaled at Owner Brann 's Glade Valley Farm 70 miles away , was the first Maryland-bred , Maryland-owned winner of Maryland 's beloved Preakness since 1877 . Rewarding his owner with $53,710 , richest prize of the year for three-year-olds , Challedon became the leading money-winner among his contemporaries ( foals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's total : $128,910 . <P> * Because both are trained by Jim Fitzsimmons.
