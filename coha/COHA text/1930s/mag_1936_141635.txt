In Atlanta last week the National Preaching Mission , currently touring the U. S. to awaken dozing Protestantism ( TIME , Sept. 28 ) , struck its first snag . The Atlanta Constitution had politely editorialized : " There should be earnest and full co-operation by the Christian people of Atlanta in the constructive and inspirational meetings to be held during the next four days . " But the Atlanta ministers in charge of arranging these inspirational meetings did not cotton to the Federal Council of Churches ' stipulation that at least one Negro be included among the speakers . Neither the protests of Preaching Missionaries nor remonstrance from the city 's Negro ministers made any difference . " Wide public controversy , " insisted the local committee , must be avoided . So the Preaching Mission followed its schedule , 100% white . <P> Though the Preaching Mission declined to sound off in the press , when its members arrived in Birmingham a few days later they showed pleasure at the inclusion on one program of Dr. Channing Tobias , national director of Negro Y. M , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in separate sections , Birmingham Negroes gladly attended meetings , shouted " Amen " and " Glory Be ! " The No. 1 Missioneer , Dr. Eli Stanley Jones , led off the opening meeting : " Constantly I remind myself that the Romans said , ' these Britons make the most unlovely , thick headed slaves we have here . . . . No good will ever come out of Britannia . ' "
