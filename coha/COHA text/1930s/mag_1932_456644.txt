DURING a visit to Paris in 1907 I saw for the first time some sculpture by Maillol , and later I told Rodin how much I liked it . He said at once that , had he seen Maillol 's work earlier , his own ideas of form would have been changed ? generous terms in which to speak of one so much his junior . I was soon to find English sculptors to be more grudging in their recognition of fresh talent . About this time a stranger came to see me , bringing a letter from Bernard Shaw . Epstein was a young sculptor with a powerful head and frame , determined-looking , enthusiastic . His people were Russians who lived in New York , he told me . He wanted to work in Europe , but he had no means . Shaw could n't help him , ? he thought his drawings mad , like burnt furze bushes , he wrote , ? but Epstein deemed I should think otherwise , so Shaw sent him to me . He showed me his drawings , illustrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if somewhat thin and tenuous . Judging from the style of the drawings , I believed he would find more sympathy in Paris or Berlin than in London . But Epstein replied he had reasons for wishing to work in London . For the moment he must go back to New York , but must somehow get back to England again . A friend of Epstein told me that his parents would n't hear of his being an artist ; if he remained in New York they would ruin his career . Perhaps if I wrote to them they might be persuaded . There was a brother , too , who might help . Of course I would write , but would a letter from me be of any use ? Somehow Epstein did manage to return from New York . I approached a Jewish society and persuaded them to help him ; and , with further small contributions , he was just able to live and work for two years . With a small shed for a studio , he began to model Rodinesque figures , wanting in form , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' What you say about my work is true , ' Epstein said ; ' but do not think that I am satisfied with what I have done myself . I know its faults , and if a regard for perfect form makes an artist a classicist , I am a classicist of classicists . ' To bring a work of sculpture to perfection needs , more than anything else , time ; also peace of mind in which to work out and perfect what one is doing . Neither of these conditions had , as yet , been realized by Epstein . He regarded what he had done as unfinished and only craved the time and opportunity in which to work on them to better them . Epstein never complained of having to live on a very small sum , but worked ceaselessly . Then came Adams and Holden , those paragons among architects , who were planning a new building for the British Medical Association . They at once realized Epstein 's power and proposed he should fill certain spaces on the facade of their building with symbolic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that the matter would go through , he took a suitable studio and set to work . It was a big undertaking to carve twelve figures , but he was full of courage . He found the work , as usual with sculptors , more costly than he had bargained for . I took Count Kessler to see it , hoping he might be interested ; but it failed to move him . Epstein met with many difficulties while carrying out the work . To carve twelve life-size figures was no easy matter ; but when the figures , depicting the birth and death of man , were uncovered , there was an uproar . Here was a sculptor who actually attempted to say , through his work , what he meant . This was not to be tolerated . For two centuries at least sculptors in England had been saying what they did n't mean with such skill that mere empty gesture had crystallized into a tradition . Mischievous people complained to the police , and there was talk of action being taken against Epstein . After fourteen months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the score of indecency , secret malice and enmity seemed likely to bring about the destruction of his conceptions . ' To have labored , conceived , and brought forth , to embody and make conceptions evident and then to have them destroyed and mutilated , would be damnable . ' Besides the architects , John , McEvoy and I wrote strong letters to the author ities defending Epstein , and finally the work was left undisturbed . ' My dear friend Rothenstein , ' Epstein wrote , I am overjoyed at the splendid result of the meeting on Wednesday and I will go on now quietly to the end . Your letter made me very happy and this great wave of sympathy from everyone has filled me with happiness . ' And , as usually happens , after all the fuss no further objection has ever been made , and the building with its figures remains one of the most significant examples of modern architecture in London . Epstein was now free to do other work . He made some admirable busts , of Mrs. Epstein , Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissioned him to model his child , Lady Ottoline Morrell a garden piece . His worst difficulties were now over . I admired much of Epstein 's work , most of all when it was not too forceful . He has a tendency , common among contemporary artists , to give more power to his forms than they can comfortably carry ? as though one pumped more air into a tire than it needed . But when Epstein is at his best , as , for instance , in the ' Lilian Shelley ' in the Tate Gallery , where head and figure are beautifully designed , there is no modeling in England to compare with his . But Epstein seems to me essentially a great portraitist . So much was said , both for and against his Rims ' and the carvings on the British Medical Association building , that in the din of controversy no sane voice could be heard . Indeed , no sane man could comfortably speak either for or against a man and his work so immoderately attacked , so uncritically praised . Epstein is by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no magic in carving ; makers of tombstones have never ceased to carve . Nor is there anything derogatory in modeling in clay . Yet for the moment it would seem as though modeling were something inferior , and only carving were worthy of sculptors . Ruskin has written more wisely than anyone else about sculpture ; he realized perfectly that roughness is necessary for work which is to be seen at a distance ? a roughness which , from a distance , looks smooth . But Epstein 's stone carvings look neither rough nor smooth ; I doubt whether he would have modeled his figures thus had he been working for bronze . An artist is the god of his own creations . It is his business , as creator , to give them strength , sanity , and health ; if he makes them either too feeble or too inflated , they are unlikely to survive . A disciplined ecstasy is the finest gift of the gods to man ; it is likewise the best an artist can give to the work of his hands . Meanwhile another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it then , to stand high among English sculptors . This was Eric Gill , who was not yet a sculptor , however , when I got to know him . I had recently painted a portrait for Magdalen College , Oxford , of George Edward Baker , their bursar . A Latin inscription was to be added . I was no letterer , but my friend Noel Rooke told me of Gill , who had recently painted their shop sign in Paris for Messrs . W. H. Smith . Gill had been trained as an architect , after which he came under Lethaby 's influence . He liked to think of himself as a working craftsman , his work anonymous as a blackbird 's song ; and he charged so much an hour for his work . His ideal at this time was to change the letter .. ing of London street names , an aim which was realized later . He now painted the inscription I needed . I was charmed by Gill 's blithe temper and we became great friends . When we went to Vattetot in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the barns , the carts , the flails still in use , and the reaping hooks ; he played charmingly on the penny whistle , and astonished the visitors at Etretat , whenever we went there , with his sandals , his red beard , and his hatless head . II Augustus John had now left Liverpool and had joined Orpen in starting a school in Chelsea ; which , proving successful , was to be taken over by some other painter . They were to be paid ? 200 for the good will on condition that they continued to teach . Scarcely was the agreement signed when John was again sounded about Liverpool , where there was talk of Lever founding a new University chair of art . John consulted me . ' An excellent proposal , dear John , ' I said , ' but are n't you bound by your recent agreement ? ' Only morally , ' was John 's laconic reply . John was wise to look to his painting for a living . The closer he kept to his easel , the better for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his paintings . Even ' The Smiling Woman ' found no purchaser for some time , and then the price for this masterpiece was only ? 60 . Nature intended John to be a great improviser . To repaint did not suit his superb lyrical gifts , which were best expressed through swift and happy lines and the fresh bloom of an inspired brush . The neglect of his copious inventiveness , so perfectly adapted for the decoration of a theatre or concert hall , irked me . I pleaded with Beerbohm Tree to get John to decorate His Majesty 's Theatre ; who better than John understood the genius of Marlowe and Shakespeare ? The cost would not then have been great ; and how great the loss ! We think only of preservation , of acquisition ? yet to employ John would be a more fruitful form of preservation and acquisition than the purchase of a new canvas for Trafalgar Square , or some early treasure for South Kensington . But we artists are largely to blame ; we should not allow such unnatural conditions to continue without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through the fruitful use of artists and craftsmen , the people were familiar with the arts . To-day we turn a deaf ear to living song , while we provide , as it were , golden cages for stuffed birds . We have removed images from our churches , to bend the knee and burn incense before them in our museums . By all means let us treasure the works of the great creators ; above all , artists are grateful for the inspiration they get from such . Certainly it is the first duty of each country to look after its own inheritance , and a museum provides safe keeping for treasures which otherwise might be ill cared for or even destroyed ; herein it performs a national service . Further , it offers , for our inspiration and information , a selection of masterpieces illustrating man 's past . But the greed , the scramble and rivalry among collectors and directors of museums for mere possession , has become an ugly , an unnatural thing . I read lately of a drawing by Durer which Germany desired to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying for it an absurd price which we could as ill afford as they . Would not a good photograph have sufficed for the use of our scholars ? Moreover , how many would notice the addition or absence of a single drawing among the riches we already possess ? Our museums are as vast as public cemeteries , compared with the old churchyards , veritable cities of monuments . Each addition becomes more costly , more wearying and confusing to the visitor , and a further encouragement to restlessness and haste , where peace and leisure are needed . What , I wonder , will future critics of our civilization say to this disproportion between the claims of the living spirit and the preservation of her past garments ? For a new Titian , much repainted , ? 120,000 was lately paid ? an annual rental of ? 6000 for a few feet of wall space ! Such a sum , well spent , would enable many living artists and craftsmen to add to the national wealth . The museums , whose function was to improve taste and active craftsmanship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality which time gives to the work of men 's hands . The growth of ' antique ' shops is a disquieting sign of the times ; our best craftsmen , who should be supplying the needs of the many who desire to have good modern furniture , silver , and tableware , are retained to make forgeries or copies of past styles . It is true that much bad decoration would result from public patronage ; but from quantity comes quality . Not from villages but from crowded cities hails the superfluous energy which generates art . There was much indifferent painting and carving in mediaeval Europe , so general was art ; but without a great demand few glorious works would have been achieved . I imagine the great split between the older and younger painters in England came about through the Post-Impressionist Exhibition of 1910 . I was away in India when that exciting show at the Grafton Gallery was held . Gill wrote to me : ? You are missing an awful excitement just now being provided for us in London ; to wit : the exhibition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All the critics are tearing one another 's eyes out over it and the sheep and the goats are inextricably mixed up . John says , ' It 's a bloody show , ' and Lady Ottoline says , ' Oh , charming ! ' As a matter of fact , those who like it show their pluck , and those who do n't show either great intelligence or else great stupidity . The show quite obviously represents a reaction and transition , and so if , like Fry , you are a factor in that reaction and transition , then you like the show . If , like MacColl and Robert Ross , you are too inseparably connected with the things reacted against and the generation from which it is a transition , then you do n't like it . If , on the other hand , you are like me and John , McEvoy and Epstein , then , feeling yourself beyond the reaction and beyond the transition , you have a right to feel superior to Mr. Henri Matisse ( who is typical of the show ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maddest ) and can say you do n't like it . But have you seen Mr. Matisse 's sculpture ? .. . Yes , I had seen Matisse 's sculpture in his studio at Paris . I could not pretend to like it , notwithstanding that Matisse gave an elaborate explanation of his intentions . It was massiveness and significance of form he aimed at . But is form merely massive ? ' I asked . May it not be alert as an animal resting is alert , ready to spring ? ' I little thought when I saw this first example of the newest sculpture what was to follow . Indeed , it was puzzling , knowing the charm of Maillol 's virginal figures , to meet with this sudden move away from the smooth radiance of form , so akin to that which Renoir had shown in his paintings of young girls , which had replaced Rodin 's more restless modeling . Why this dour heaviness , this solemnity which one was now to meet with ? What total absence of movement , what megalomania ! These cubistic sculptors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is a story of a saint , a lady whom a Roman general desired to share his bed . The lady thereupon sat on the ground , and first one and then several slaves were called upon to move her ; finally a whole regiment was ordered up , but still the lady sat immovable . I am reminded of this saint before the massive blocks that now are alone deemed suited to architecture ? as though carving should not play , like a flame , about a building . Ornament is the flower of the human spirit ; yet some frost has now nipped its bloom . Observe the flowering of the chestnut ? as though ten thousand candles in praise of life were lighted on the tree . I believe the human spirit will flower again ; when this tedious pedantry of inert mass shall have passed its dull and heavy record , time and weather will refine with their merciful patina . Time is the master artist , who , with a touch or two , gives grace and style even to poor witless apprentice work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? chiefly studio nudes . The nude was a Salon tradition ; each annual Salon provided paintings of Parisiennes lying on divans in provocative poses , and each year reproductions of these brought a wide sale for the Salon catalogues . Matisse 's nudes were the honest studies of a serious student with a sense of good painting who improvised well from the model , yet a student with no clear aim , with no imagination , and with little sense of composition . Pritchard , a friend from Lewes House , had taken me to Matisse 's studio , and the Berensons introduced me to Leonard Stein and Gertrude , his sister , whose flat was full of Matisse 's paintings . Matisse had given up his rather dry studies and was now painting violent forms with violent colors . He was still an improviser from the model ; an improviser of simple figures , for his gift was too slender to master the more complex difficulties with which the older painters were able to cope . Here were powerful studies , but how they smelled of paint ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the black eyes too large and black , and the drawing was over-deliberate . But Matisse was very intelligent , a man to be reckoned with . He knew his museums , had looked about him with a discerning eye , and was aware of the charm , not only of improvisation , but of direct statement of pattern . So he aimed at giving on canvas something of the quality of design which Persian potters and tile painters gave to their deft , fecund brushwork . A large clumsy design of women dancing , a prominent work at the Post-Impressionist Exhibition , which might have been suitable enough for tiles , seemed to me quite unfitted for oil colors and canvas , materials adapted for representative painting . But Matisse happened to hit the taste of the time , when connoisseurs , scholars , and dilettanti brought up on museums were occupied with the comparison of styles and of schools , with attribution and denial of works to particular masters ; and naturally such men are avid of theories which appeal to the mind , for the minds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Henceforth criticism was to be occupied with a literary or philosophical interpretation of the arts , with elaborate theories about form which soon became popular among those who wished to be in the fashion . The imaginative side of the painter 's nature was now condemned as ' literary ' ; and literary faculties were concentrated on painting and drawing which could not be understood without verbal explanation . Theheight of absurdity was achieved when , at one and the same time , representative art was to give way before significant form , and highly complex theories concerning the third dimension and of color values were evolved , which were now applied to Giotto and the primitives , who , according to the theorists , could have been as photographically accurate as modern painters had they wished ; it was their conscious esthetic choice which dictated their naivete , not their place in time ! Could anything be less unpsychological ' ? And at this time , when men pride themselves on their analytical insight ! But to-day the priest who knows all about God has been replaced by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throng to hear the latest word on creation from men who do not create . Even Matisse must have tired of the doctrine , for he has dropped significant form ' and distortion , to return to direct drawing and painting . A charming colorist is Matisse , and a lively draftsman . His aim is now a modeet one ; he remains true to simple studies , and has little ambition for any but a limited objective . He shoots his bolt ; it may hit the target near the centre , but the target is very close to his bow . Yet for a man to impress his vision , as Matisse has done , on his own generation is no mean thing . Always there are at the same time similar germs impregnating art , literature , science , and philosophy . Indeed , the fact that there is so general a response to Matisse 's art is itself significant , though that response may be the result of confusion , or despair , or hesitation after a period of conviction , of sustained faith and hope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relative truth of appearance , painters too will again concentrate on this shining symbol of reality . Meanwhile there is an intui- // tion among artists , in sympathy with that of our psychologists , that dynamic shapes , swift angles , and strong colors have a marked effect on our mood . The artists of the baroque period were well aware of this influence , and the early painters used horizontal and perpendicular forms to give dignity and repose to their panels and mural paintings . This sense of the emotional power of pure shapes and colors was lost by the academic artists of the nineteenth century , and it was against their irresponsible picture-making that the Pre-Raphaelites and Impressionists protested . To-day the younger men in their turn react against what they regard as the tyranny of appearance . It is not for our academics who try to be historians or retailers of anecdote to point the finger of scorn at our ' moderns ' who put blinkers on their eyes to follow philosophers and mathematicians . Yet what irony in the fact that the very painters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romance and illustration , they alone give us pure art ? turn their eyes away from appearance , to look , as it were , inward , producing art so incomprehensible that it must be expounded in books and articles by men of letters . The same fate has befallen Cezanne , whose good , solid , and powerful painting is enveloped in a fog of sentimental mysticism . But a much stronger claim is made , by the younger artists , for azanne : that he has revolutionized the painter 's approach to form , as no one since El Greco has done ; that he looked at nature more profoundly than a mere surface painter like Velasquez did , and , taking visible form as his raw material merely , passed the natural images made on his eye through the shuttles of his mind , whence it was transformed into a new material , an organized pattern , significant , ill uminating , born of the marriage of sight and intellect . COzanne 's hand , through its very inability to translate form from eye to canvas without constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less like what men call normal appearance , than that of a more skillful artist like Manet or Degas . A solitary and impassioned worker , he was also a thinker , who saw that the value of a great work of art lies in its uniqueness , in the fact that what the painter did , that he experienced ; that each touch of his brush was born of will and sensitiveness , and so , through a series of single acts , it became fused into a whole . He too felt himself to be unique ; only in solitude , through his own struggle , he finally asserts his reality . In this spirit , as though no problem had yet been solved , he worked throughout his life . This , I think , is the secret of the power that Cezanne 's work has upon his successors . The best of those stirred by his influence will also feel their own uniqueness , and thus his example will lead to paintings , not like C6zanne 's , but far otherwise . The younger artists are much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cezanne never saw clearly , as did Millet and Daumier , that the sense of mass comes from our perception that parts of form are turned toward and others away from the source of light . They learned this lesson , perhaps , from the old-fashioned cube , though more likely from their firm grasp of this simple principle . Artists who have important truths to impart need a clear system of msthetic . Daumier and Millet expressed the sense of volume more clearly and more completely , perhaps , than any artists before or since their time ; yet , because their aesthetic sensibility was used to present a more epic picture of the life of man than their followers conceived , the im- portance of their formal qualities goes unrecognized . A generation that sanctifies the austere devotion of a Cezanne and acclaims a Picasso is not easy to comprehend . But men travel- by different roads ; some toil up mountain paths , others speed along smooth , broad ways through the valley . While one man looks out upon the landscape from a height , and sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while around are hills , olive- and vine-clad , and all seems eternal peace , the ears of another are split with the noise and confusion of a village which , to that other , appears but as a fleck of white on the crest of a hill or the sweep of a valley . The impulse to replace vision by intellectual reason began in France , but the Frenchman has an innate classicism which gives distinction to his form and design , whatever his principles may be . It was not until some years later that the germ of this doctrine was carried to England . The urge to create pure form is , maybe , the first among many impulses ; but an artist must relate his abstract conceptions to the evidence of his senses , for , fallible though our senses may be , they are yet , as it were , a fixed point to which all experience may be related . Art and literature which do not combine form with human drama can not satisfy mankind . The minds of artists are not so limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with those emotions attendant on man 's pilgrimage through life which bring the arts within the orbit of common experience . There are signs , indeed , that this is again being realized by some of our younger painters . Interest in form for its own sake has never distinguished English painters . To-day , standing aloof from the ' abstract ' painters , there are a number of young artists who give fresh and vigorous attention to the life about them . In English painting there is something akin to the provincial flavor of Mark Rutherford 's and Thomas Hardy 's writing , an imaginative quality set down with reticence , yet by no means wanting in passion . It is not always the men who are most discussed during their lifetime who to succeeding generations stand as the interpreters of their generation . There is still surprising creative vitality in Europe ; yet one asks one 's self , seeing how naturally rich and fertile is the artistic field , whether the publicity given to artists in vogue does not corrupt many young , ingenuous natures , who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more personal , more scrupulous work . Yet advertisement itself offers scope for much ingenuity , and the effect of contemporary painting on design , on the quality and pattern of our fabrics , pottery , book illustrations , posters , book jackets , fashion plates , ? indeed , on everything connected with the making of books and magazines , ? has been highly stimulating . Elegance and finish , disdained by painters , are happily expressed in the minor arts ; much that is inappropriate to canvas and paint is perfectly suited to the crafts , and herein Picasso 's influence ? I once called Picasso the gigolo of geometry ? has been fruitful . We are singing , maybe , the swan song of luxury before a new social order sweeps it away . The glory of Western painting has been the compassing of great achievement . So low a standard of skill as now permits men to practise painting has not been known since the dark ages . Invention , a fresh outlook on art and on nature , is rightly praised ; some amateurishness , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or genuine naivete , is present . But the imitation of passion , the affectation of innocence , these have no worth , save in the eyes of critics and dilettanti , who assume that something which looks like an acknowledged work of art must share its qualities . The original Impressionists and Pre-Raphaelites , for instance , remain , while their imitators have disappeared . Up to the middle of the nineteenth century the followers of a sound master at least learned their trade as draftsmen , painters , or craftsmen , and could deal faithfully with the subject set them . Mulready , Landseer , Winterhalter , and Frith , painters who are now held in contempt , could do whatever their fancy bade them with a virtuosity denied to the moderns . ' I have often been asked to recommend painters for portraits of women and children , but the grace and charm the early Victorian painters commanded are no longer within our compass . No doubt contempt for skill arises from impatience with the triviality or unreality of aim and vision , for which the academic Victorians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , in the sixteenth century and after ; hence the growing tendency to look back to early periods of art . It is to my mind a fallacy based on comparison with later developments to insist on the more abstract quality of early painting and sculpture . Yet it is doubtful whether any art , even that which appears to us the most primitive , seemed simple when seen by contemporary eyes . Homer 's description of tie shield of Achilles denotes a highly realistic complex art ; yet , could we now behold such a shield as Homer wrote of , we should deem it na ? ve and archaic . Stories of paintings which have come down to us ? the birdspecking at the painted grapes , for example ? point to an acceptance of painting as a completely representative art . Shakespeare 's notion of a work of sculpture , in The Winter 's Tale , suggests a like conception ; and no doubt the Byzantine mosaics and illuminations appeared , to contemporary eyes , vivid and lifelike pictures . We prefer the simple , direct , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false heroics of later artists , and need something of the austerity and conviction of the earlier masters in our work to-day . But we must look for a more profound explanation of a phase which is too characteristic of modern art to be overlooked . We are faced with a persistent effort , an attempt to replace the thing seen by the evidence of the intellect . Many of us differ profoundly from this attitude as applied to the arts ; but it is in harmony with the challenge to our senses which is more and more occupying the attention of our all-powerful physicists . Foreign critics first began to entice painters toward a new atheism : the denial of the material world . Painters and sculptors are no longer to trust their eyes , but must consciously use their intellects . They are unlikely to attend long to such unwise counsel . Indeed , if artists listened to this unseductive song of a blue-stockinged Circe , their art ( like Ilmnpty Dumpty ) not all the King 's horses and all the King 's men could again set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain qualities which children ? and sometimes amateurs ? show in their work , a directness of vision and expression which seem beyond the compass of their own subtler eyes and more complex experience . The douanier Rousseau 's painting is typical of this ingenuousness ; so are the paintings of many workingmen in England . But the affectation of naivete is always ridiculous . Formerly there were harlots who walked in Regent Street , clad in the short skirts of schoolgirls , with golden hair hanging down their backs , but which of these poor wantons showed the maiden 's liquid eye and sparkling innocence ? Yet quite clever people are deceived by a similar pretense in literature and art . Picasso , that sad aesthetic rake , spends each week-end with a different style ; and how many young foreigners , who envy him his gallantry , he has debauched by his example ! I sometimes wish certain English painters would be a little naughtier , after his fashion . I could wish them more faithful to their wives ? more true to Mary Anne and more faithless to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our originals all paint alike . Though a modern painter can , through his own inner passion , give significance to the everyday things of life , I was possessed by the idea that some subject of common interest to artist and public as well was needed if a healthy interest in the arts was to be born again . /Esthetic and technical problems , an essential part of their craft , are chiefly of moment to artists . Popular interest comes from subject and its presentation ; the finer sensibilities grow therefrom . It is thus , too , with literature ; interest of story precedes the attraction of style . Moreover , the recognition of familiar things in the form of art pleases everyone . Painters know the countryman 's pleasure when he sees a familiar figure or landmark represented on canvas . In a village hall , the local hedger and thatcher , the carter and ploughman , would be fitly portrayed against the familiar local landscape . In town or city , the notables , the Lord Mayor , Vice Chancellor of the University , Town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others could serve as models for contemporary or past local history . For this local talent , too , would be well employed , and here and there a local school of painting might grow up . I pleaded with Sir Robert Morant to appoint in Yorkshire or Lancashire an inspiring artist to lead the way in some such direction , and when ( in 1910 ) a committee sat to inquire into the scope of the Royal College of Art , I gave evidence toward this end . I still cling to this heresy ; indeed , the later developments of painting and sculpture , so little individual , so akin in their cosmopolitan sameness to the European tailoring which is everywhere replacing dignified and beautiful local dress , have convinced me of the fruitlessness of mere aesthetic gesture . Let an artist , by all means , work for himself ; he has within him something which he , and no other , can say . But let him not confuse this honorable isolation with painting or carving or modeling to please the cognoscenti , the baggage followers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the favors of these last is to risk an artistic disease , one from which many paintings and carvings suffer . Were I asked to name it , I would call it collector 's pox , a mal de Chine , or d'Afrique . Style grows from within ; it is intrinsic in all good work ; it is the quiet good manners of art . You know a man by his speech , by his behavior , by his dress ; by the same tokens well-bred painting may be recognized . ' How like commonplace is a masterpiece , ' said Gauguin . The desire for perfection other than that dictated by the client , who wants finish , ' is innate in the artist . Perfection exists apart from accuracy ; the Chinese or Japanese artist aims at precision of touch , at a suggestion of a grace he finds in every blade of grass , in the bend of a bough , in the petals of a blossom . He who desires to achieve this sweeping finish should not , to my thinking , use oil paint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitted to render visual truth . In comparison with the graphic arts , too much prestige is given to oil painting . The essence of art is drawing , whereby body and spirit can be most perfectly united . Indeed , through drawing the modern movement ' has perhaps been most legitimately expressed . Even in the pages of fashion magazines , in Vogue and Harper 's Bazaar , the fine flower of modernity can be seen ; some of the fashion plates have a quality akin to that of Greek vase painting . While painting sometimes seems to be a lost art , the number of men who do excellent drawings is surprising . Eric Gill , John Nash , Eric Ravilious , Gwen Raverat , and Blair Hughes-Stanton have once again raised English wood engraving to a high level . Some of their white-line compositions are exquisite works of art . But the influence of Continental artists , of Matisse and Picasso especially , has seduced English painters from their old independence . Only a few among the younger painters have kept their birthright , notably Stanley and Gilbert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me from Paris : ' I wish you could be in Paris these days . I do n't want to work ? that is , not on anything I 'm doing . I want to start something fresh and raw . I feel inclined to paint a nude in cadmium and indigo and orange . The " Independents " is effrogable ? and yet one feels sometimes these chaps have blundered on something alive , without being able to master it . ' John too , for a time , looked on life with an ' early ' eye . As with other virile men , his mind and heart were at the same time complex and sim ple . How often one hears the tedious cliche , ' Though a great artist , he is so simple . ' The simplest persons are the egoists , who think overmuch of themselves ; a superior spirit has more complex motives , which sensitive feelings allow him to educate . John 's ardent soul dances before the ark of Leonardo and El Greco as it does before that of Giotto . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts of sluggish minds . Yet he takes his subjects by assault , never by cunning . Epstein has similar courage , but he has not John 's lyrical genius ; it is in the external world that he finds his inspiration . That one should be head over ears in love with some aspect of life is what matters . An artist who turns from his work to fulfill his duties as a citizen may feel he is wasting precious life ; for he is more ashamed of telling untruth with his pencil than of fibbing and prevaricating among his neighbors . Yet how tell the truth about the rainbow , about a blossoming almond tree , the lights and shadows that sweep over the mountains , changing their shapes from moment to moment , about the sun , about the night hung with a million million stars ? Behold a tree . It has grown , a miracle of strength and complex beauty , from a tiny seed ; the sun has drawn it upward , gravity has disciplined its growth , the winds have twined and twisted its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex laws which have woven its shape on their mysterious loom . But by subjecting himself intuitively to its appearance , by emptying himself and concentrating wholly on this shape and that , he may yet interpret the hidden forces of which the tree is the effective symbol . How absurd to speak of realism as though objective painting were of necessity less interpretative of spirit than illustrative , romantic , or abstract art . Creation is intuitive self-surrender , the entering into the thing loved . As the youth with the maid does not think of the miracle of childbirth that may ensue , or even of the beauty of the maid he clasps to him , but surrenders himself that he may unite , body and spirit , with her body and spirit , so the artist is oblivious of the final picture , and loses himself in active union with the object of his desire . This is the value of the work of art ? it is the supreme surrender of self and at the same time an act of masculine virility . Herein lies the impossibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relative unimportance of understanding . Appreciation is one of the social amenities of life ; creation alone has positive value . Hence the ancient difference betwixt critic and artist , between artist and public . Criticism is refined gossip . The truth between man and woman is known only to the two concerned , but is yet the occasion of infinite surmise by outsiders ; so only the artist knows what ecstasy , what agony , possessed him when he knew ? simple and significant word ! ? his subject . The truth between man and woman ! If women told it , how many men would hide their heads ! The true work of art wears on its surface , as it were , something akin to the radiance on the face of the satisfied woman . Yet how easily , with what cheap deception , can the appreciator be humbugged ! An artificial accent , the frequent use of modish slang , ? ' top hole , fed up with , I simply love it , too devastating , ' ? offend a sensitive ear ; but a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last word in refinement . Hence one prefers ignorant people to the initiated , who are too familiar with the shibboleths of Mayfair , Bloomsbury , and Chelsea to have preserved their ingenuousness . In the company of a few rare spirits we are possessed by our truest self ; and we see the light , as through a prism , red , orange , yellow , and violet . To speak of these'colors to others were , for the most part , in vain . One can be truthful only with one 's equals ; with those who have not his whole respect , the wise man is polite .
