txt No more refreshing and challenging word has been spoken in these days of confused and confusing voices than that of President HOPKivs of Dartmouth College at the opening of the academic year . He is aware that many of his assertions are " more definitely in the contro " versial field than is ordinarily ap " propriate to an academic address , " but the times will not let him keep silent . As he was once an ardent Bull Mooser , his views are of especial interest . The most serious danger threatening civilization today , in his view , is " the rapid development of a perverted sense of democracy " both at home and abroad , which encourages public opinion not only to accept but to idealize mediocrity and which allows public opinion to be ostentatiously arrogant in its indifference to intelligence and antagonistic toward any process of thought in its leaders which rises above its own average mental capacity . 0 Himself a firm believer in democracy , his argument is against an undisciplined and irresponsible form of it . Left to itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intolerance toward those possessed of the higher attributes . " Public confidence and " public applause are given most " largely not to those who are ca " pable of raising the level upon " which we live and think and act , " but to those who stoop to the aver " age and pander to the common . " On the other hand , the number who have had formal education , supplemented by , the host who without it have high intelligence and good-will , is great enough to assert itself effectively " in the creation of a new " spirit toward government and in " the establishment of a new social " order , " and to mobilize for cooperative action . Dr. HOPKINS dares to recall a chapter in history which is not pleasant reading at the present moment but of which everybody can see the bearing : The Praetorian Guard was originally recruited to safeguard home affairs and was selected from men distinguished for valor in foreign service and for their keen sense of patriotism . For a time these legions were the pride of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their potential power sprang up among the legions and an acquisitiveness for preferential treatment which led to demand after demand upon the State for gratuities . Cultivating their power in deciding elections , they secured what they sought in each successive demand . Gradually their appetite for extravagant subsidy became so voracious that they turned to the use of force and assassination , overthrew the government , and called for competitive bids for their favor , promising to make him Emperor who would distribute among them the largest money grants . Going from one bidder to another and holding the election open until the highest possible offer had been secured , sale of the position was made to a member of the Roman Senate who eventually made payment from the public treasury at a cost of millions to the State . However , this college president ends by saying that there was never a generation more to be envied than the one now coming on , " if only it " Will impose upon itself the require " ment to develop itself to the limit " of its capability .
