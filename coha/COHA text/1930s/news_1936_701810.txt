txt Concerning Subsidies The United States Chamber of Commerce and the American Liberty League have vehemently protested against the various brain-trust schemes for subsidizing the farmers . In this they have been entirely right , for , as Grover Cleveland wrote : " It is the duty of the people to support their government , and not of the government to support the people , " Following the agreement on a bill providing for increased subsidies to be paid to steamship construction and owners out of the funds wrung from our overburdened taxpayers , I have looked carefully for some protest by these self-constituted watchdogs of the Treasury against the subsidy scheme . So far , not a word . Are we to infer that Federal subsidies to the farmers are all wrong , but that payment of hundreds of millions of dollars private industries , such as steamship construction and operation , is all right ?
