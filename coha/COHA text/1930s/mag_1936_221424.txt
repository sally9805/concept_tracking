In the official mind of Manhattan 's Metropolitan Museum of Art only two men have ever really used paint . One was Rembrandt the Dutchman . The other was Titian the Venetian . Of some 300 closely-held authentic Titians , the Metropolitan until last week had only two . Then it bought a third from Duveen Bros. , Inc. and called it " the most important purchase of a single piece of art ever made by the museum . " Asked the price of this jewel , the Museum 's Director Herbert Eustis Winlock replied , " We never talk prices . They do n't mean anything . " A good guess : $300,000 . <P> The new Titian was Venus and the Lute Player . Lord Duveen , after buying it from the third Earl of Leicester in 1932 , lent it to Chicago 's Century of Progress Exposition and to Venice 's great Titian exhibition where it hung with the famed Venus of Urbino ( TIME , May 13 ) . <P> Venus and the Lute Player , finished when the world 's longest-living ( 99 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " yellow &; blue " period with overtones of the preceding " red &; green . " No diet-disciplined Hollywood beauty , the great-hipped , heavy-stomached Venus lies on a violet couch while a Cupid crowns her with flowers , and a boyish nobleman serenades her with a lute . The paint job is superb , the composition dramatic . Credited with being the first intimations of 18th Century Impressionism are the blue mountains , the wide vague plain in the background . <P> So impressed was the Metropolitan with its purchase last week that , against all precedent , it hung the new Titian at once , in a permanent place of honor at the head of the main stairs .
