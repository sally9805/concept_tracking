BISHOP WHIPPLE 'S SOUTHERN DIARY 1843-1844-Edited by Lester B. Shippee - University of Minnesota Press ( $3.50 ) . <P> Except to churchmen , the name of Henry Benjamin Whipple now means little . But for almost 40 years this energetic , squarejawed , hard-traveling Episcopal bishop of Minnesota was a U. S. figure to be taken seriously : a man of affairs who exerted his influence from the poverty-stricken , remote frontier post of Faribault , Minn. ; a missionary who was denounced by Senators and generals for his defense of the Indians after the Sioux Outbreak in 1862 ; an ecclesiastical leader who conferred with Queen Victoria and Abraham Lincoln , preached in most of the cathedrals of England and turned down the bishopric of the Sandwich Islands because he thought his work in Minnesota needed him more . Born in upper New York State in 1822 , Whipple studied in the abolitionist hotbed of Oberlin Institute , married at 20 , became a " rational abolitionist , " a conservative Democrat , a politician , a businessman , before his wife persuaded him to take Holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a brief , old-fashioned travel diary was found among Bishop Whipple 's papers . When he was 21 , ill-health had driven him South for the winter , on a long , tedious , weakening journey . He went from New York to Savannah on a first-class merchantman , from Savannah to St. Augustine by steamer , across Georgia " on the worst railroad ever invented , " by river boat from New Orleans to St. Louis , up the Ohio on the crowded , dirty Goddess of Liberty ( " anything but a goddess , " wrote young Whipple sourly ) . by stage ( " far pleasanter than on a rail-road car " ) from Cincinnati to Cumberland , W. Va . <P> A lively piece of Americana , Bishop Whipple 's Southern Diary is a 208-page volume that contains some shrewd observations on the weakening effects of slavery on the Southern white population , a good picture of Florida justice , a horrified account of New Orleans ' fabled immorality , pious reflections mingled with longings for home and loved ones .

He put down the population of the towns he passed , the number of rooms in the St. Charles Hotel in New Orleans , the speed of railroads , the price of cotton . But the most notable feature of his trip was its hardships : he was seasick on the Lancashire going South ( " I would not wish an enemy 's dog a sorer punishment than this deadly seasickness " ) , exasperated by the slowness of railroads as well as by the smoke in cars that threatened to " transfer us into bacon , " frightened by the possibility that the train would go off the track or a rail come through the floor of the car . On steamers he was afraid of fire . He was relieved when he got into stage-coaches , but on one a driver was drunk , on another a wagon tongue broke , almost tipped them off a mountain . Although he does not say that he regained his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression that Southern sunshine must have been beneficial , or he could never have stood the trip home .
