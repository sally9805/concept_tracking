Political lightning struck Iowa when Harry Hopkins , boss of WPA and a sitter on the New Deal Olympus , flatly plumped for Representative Otha Donner Wearin in this week 's Democratic Senatorial primary ( TIME , June 6 ) . What would otherwise have been a routine performance amid the fields of waving corn , with Senator Guy Mark Gillette walking sedately off renominated , was instantly transformed into a microcosm of the national political situation , a furious hurly-burly involving scores of participants far beyond Iowa 's borders . <P> Senator Gillette , backed by the State machine of his colleague Senator Clyde Herring and Governor Nelson G. Kraschel , backed also by Catholics , the A.F of L. and reputedly by Boss Jim Farley , stormed up &; down the State denouncing " this gang of political termites . . . boring from within . . . planning on taking over , if possible , the control of the Democratic party organization in 1940 . " Along with ' Harry Hopkins he damned Tommy Corcoran , Congressman Maury Maverick of Texas , Homer Martin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had unrighteously butted in by endorsing Mr. Wearin . He referred to his vote against the President 's Supreme Court bill as " my crime . . . which has brought down upon me and my candidacy this pack of political wolves from all over the United States . " <P> Otha Wearin , meantime , was playing up the Hopkins endorsement for all it was worth . It made him , he insisted , manifestly the anointed choice of the White House . Scornfully he exposed an effort by Senator Herring to get him to sign a post-primary peace agreement with Senator Gillette . This , he said , was an insidious effort by the Senators to suggest that <P> President Roosevelt was more interested in party unity in Iowa than in the primary 's outcome . Two days before the polls opened , he suddenly was able to play a political trump almost as big as the Hopkins endorsement . To his friend , Lawyer Ed G. Dunn of Mason City , came this telegram : <P> " Dear Ed : <P> " I am informed that a story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make in Iowa in behalf of the candidacy of Otha Wearin during my recent visit to the Mayo Clinic at Rochester . Minn . <P> " This is a deliberate misrepresentation intended to injure my friend , Otha Wearin . <P> " I had no such plans to come to Iowa because my doctors would not have permitted them . <P> " If I had such plans , you may be sure I would have kept them . <P> " You have my full authority to use this statement . <P> " James Roosevelt " <P> Triumphantly " My Friend Otha " concluded his campaign : " The issue is clear . It is simply a question of whether Iowa wants to go forward with Roosevelt or backward with his enemies ! " <P> Thus it was that when Iowa 's votes were counted , it seemed to matter little that a lot of other candidates were nominated for a lot of other offices ; that former Senator Lester Jesse Dickinson beat Representative Lloyd Thurston for the Republican nomination for Senator . Looming with a significance precisely equal to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic Senatorial result : Gillette over Wearift by about 2-to-1 . Three other Democratic candidates polled negligible votes .
