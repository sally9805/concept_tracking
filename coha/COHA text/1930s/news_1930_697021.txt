txt NO INCOME , NO TAXES . Suggestion for New Method of Assessment Meets With Objections . To the Editor of The New York Times : THE TIMES prints a letter from E. W. Estes in which he says : " Until the law is changed , making the assessed valuation for both land and building dependent upon the value of the net income from such building , this - injurious situation will continue to exist . " That is a quaint idea in these days . Carried to its logical conclusion , here is the result : No income ; no taxation . But it is not a new idea . That system existed all through Europe in the old days , . and in England until recently . Large landed estates paid small taxes or none at all because they produced ' little or no income . The owners did not intend their magnificent estates to produce incomes . The tax burden was borne by the farmers , the mere-I:lents and industrial workers . A government is created by people for their common good . Once set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should , therefore , be supported by all . If there is any defect or default in the administration of these functions in a democracy the people have it within their power to correct it . If the doctrine of " no income , no taxation " was applied here in New York , what would be the result ? There are a number of vacant plots of ground , some of them very valuable , which the owners will neither sell nor lease . There also are buildings ' in New York that are vacant because the owners insist on such a high rental , or such unreasonable terms , that they remain vacant . These properties , under Mr. Estes 's proposal , would pay no taxes . The same logic applies to the large estates in Westchester County and on ? Long Island , from which their wealthy owners derive no income . Practically all property is worth something . If the owners will not sell or rent , there is no good reason why they should not pay taxes . The functions and expenses of the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate must pay his share , and his share is measured by the two great functions of a government : protection to life and protection to property . In New York City if a property has a high assessment , it must be good property . If . after paying a tax of $2.75 per $100 value , there is not left , after all other expenses , sufficient to pay a net income of not less than 8 per cent , the property is either not in good condition , not properly handled , or it is inadequate for the neighborhood . If a property is overtaxed , an owner ought to be able to prove it to the assessors . Do that , and a reduction follows quickly . U. A. KEARIN . Brooklyn , Jan. 31 , 1930 . MISSIONARIES IN CHINA . They Will Be . Disliked Until Freed From Government Assistance . To the Editor of The New York Times : Though I have not been in China for seven months , I nevertheless feel that I am on safe ground in doubting the report sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missionaries Fear Setback in China . " Missionary opinion is divided in the matter of government protection , extraterritorial privileges and treaty rights . It is impossible , even for your correspondent , to discover just what proportion of the missionaries was thrown into consternation by Foreign Minister Henderson 's announcement that treaty protection would be withdrawn from British missionaries . His article , however , gives the impression that he classed the ? great majority of both British and American workers with this group . He should , in fairness , have noted the increasing numbers of those who have come to believe that the message of Jesus in China or anywhere else can never be consistently backed by force or unfriendly pressure . Quite a large group of such American men and women have definitely and publicly stated not only their willingness but their anxiety to give up special rights , and have always been answered by our government that It is impossible  --  business people and missionaries must be treated alike . Ministers and Lampson can tell how many such requests have been made . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missionaries before taking the step he did . I for one am thoroughly convinced that Christians will continue to be disliked by Chinese until they can get , rid of ' this severe handicap of government " assistance , " which places us in the class of the ex ' ploiters . May I also take occasion to deny your correspondent 's statement that " the Nationalist movement also is inimical to Christianity and all missions " ? Such a statement is absurd when so many of the Nationalist leaders are Christians themselves and when so many Christian leaders  - -  all of them , I should estimate -- are ardent Nationalists . There is no conflict between a sane nationalism and Christianity , and the Chinese know this as well as we . RICHARD H. RI . bJR . New York , Jan. 29 , 1930 . NO MYSTERY ABOUT IT . Denial That Women Follow Fashion for Strange Reasons . To the Editor of The New York Times : In a recent editorial in THE Truss , entitled " Dictates of Fashion , " you suggest there being a very urgent need of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just because ' she is turning from the skirt that reveals her form as it is , to 4ine that suggests what it might be , is no reason why her motives should be analyzed . From the very beginning of clothes fashion has dictated what to wear . Even Eve did not always wear fig leaves because they ' were the first style in dress . The sense of beauty and the love of change are what makes for variety in woman 's clothes . Also a wish to please the man whom she knows in his heart likes her best when she Is always different . The editorial goes on to say the conservative woman clings to last year 's short skirt . She is only conservative because she - has to be practical  --  wear the old short skirt until she can afford to . buy a new long one . For the home dressmaker , changing from short to long is more difficult than the change from long to short . It is not so easy to add to the length as it is to cut it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than man and takes to changes more easily . She thinks nothing of wearing a- straw hat in January and a velvet one in August . Not so the man . He dares not put on a straw hat until a certain prescribed date and will not wear it after the time dictated by public opinion . Woman needs no psychological analysis . Fashion will always dictate to her , and men will always admire her for her infinite variety . N. B. New York , Jan. 30 , 1930 . Ho for the Open Road ! To the Editor of The New York Times : Bravo , Mr. Filene ! Macte virtute ! More , power to his voice ! If he can mass a strong commercial organization behind a movement to " put the nation on its feet , ' it may yet happen that my next-door neighbor can come to tea even when her husband is out with the car , and that I , who have no means to maintain a car , no place to put , one and no aptitude for driving one , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and back without shortening my life with the nervous strain of dodging Cars . Nay , who knows but a fair dream , once cherished but some time singe abandoned , a dream of tramping with staff and pack from Woodbury to Greens Farms , might come true ? A footpath by every paved road ? that is the slogan . How gladly would I see my shoe bill doubled annually by such means ! I shall go at once and shake the dust off the rucksack . GRACE GOODALE . ? Woodbury , Conn. , Jan. 31 , 1930 . An Appreciation . To the Editor of The New York Times : May I ' comment upon a feature of your editorial page about which I have frequently remarked  --  namely , the abundance of biblical allusions ? Whether-at first or second hand , the fact remains that you seem to be saturated with scriptural expressions . I discover them with delight . Of course , this is not the only reason why I am fond of your editorial prege . I feel that I need it to keep me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old town and in the world . Rev. ARTHUR . B. McCORMICK . Oil .
