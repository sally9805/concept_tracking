IN JANUARY , 1942 , a long , angry howl of I disappointment will be heard rumbling throughout the length and breadth of the land . In that month , the first pensions under the federal contributory old-age insurance system will be paid to the first batch of beneficiaries reaching the retitement age . This is the old-age insurance plan which is supposed to end the tribulations of the aged with dignity and decency . Their neighbors and fellow-townsmen who get benefits of the public-charity description from the states may be getting as much as $30 a month . But under this system of purchased insurance , a man earning a hundred dollars a month will , in 1942 , be obliged to give up his job and pauperize himself in order to draw the $17 a month old-age insurance he has bought from the government . The charity pensioners who get almost twice as much will give him a horse laugh as he sinks back into the dignity and decency of retirement on $17 a month . The reader will probably be surprised to learn how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surmise at once that this is because the government is not collecting enough money in premiums to pay more . The guess will be wrong . The reason is a little shocking . The government is collecting and will continue to collect in payroll taxes for a generation enough money to pay benefits many times this sum . But it will not pay adequate pensions ? and this is the point I aim at ? because all the time it will bespending the old age insurance premium taxes for other things ? paying the ordinary expenses of the government . If the reader is a little surprised at this , let me add three very serious statements . First , the government will in the years up to 1980 collect in taxes for old-age pensions about 111 billion dollars . Second , of this 111 billion some 43 per cent , or 47 billion , will never be spent for old-age pensions at all but for every sort of government expense including , perhaps , building battleships . And , third , the government will never return this 47 billion dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the weirdest and most fantastic episodes in public finance . Unfortunately all this is cloaked under a collection of seemingly just and prudent arrangements ? arrangements which are mere fictions , however , and must be examined narrowly to be seen in their true relations . It is very necessary that we have clearly in mind that under our Social Security Act two sorts of benefits are provided for the aged . The government set out to establish an old-age retirement system which would provide a decent annuity for workers and for which the workers would pay . It was to be organized as an insurance system but operated by the government . The members of this system were to be taxed on their wages monthly and , when 65 years of age , would he entitled to the benefits provided in the act . But obviously people already past the retirement age could not get such insurance any more than a man who is dead can get life insurance . Therefore to provide some protection for those already arrived at retirement age an entirely separate system was established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Old Age Assistance Plan for people already past 65 . The other is called the Old Age Benefit Plan for those not yet arrived at retirement age . The first is entrusted to the states to organize , manage , and support , save that the federal government will make grants directly to the states to aid in supporting the plan . The second is organized and operated by the national government through the Social Security Board . It is of this latter plan that we propose to speak here . But we shall concern ourselves with only one feature of this plan ? the incredible scheme , as chimerical as Dr. Townsend 's wildest inventions or California 's famous ham-and-eggs device for $30-every-Thursday ? the scheme to create a vast reserve fund of 47 billion dollars . As the government was setting up an insurance plan , what more plausible than to do it as a private company would do it ? to create a great reserve fund to insure the financial soundness of the plan ? In other words , the government decided to charge the members at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and also to accumulate in the course of time a reserve fund , called the Old Age Account , of 47 billion dollars . The theory is plausible . The government will " save " for the fund a large sum each year and invest it in government bonds ? the soundest securities in the world . Back of the great plan , therefore , will always be this huge reserve with its constantly accumulating interest . But there is another reason for the reserve , also touched with the fatal vice of plausibility . This insurance plan is going to cost a great deal of money . It is tobe paid for by a tax on the workers and their employers , and these taxes will be sufficient to pay the bills for many years . But there will come a time when the number retiring will be so large that the old-age taxes will be insufficient to pay the benefits . Then the government will have to supplement the old-age taxes with other taxes . But by that time the reserve fund will have risen to many billions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The interest on this investment will be sufficient to meet the deficits and thus save the government from imposing further taxation . To put this concretely , here is the way it will work . Every employee who is a member of the insurance plan will be taxed one per cent of his wages and his employer will be taxed one per cent . The employer must deduct one per cent from the pay envelope and add one per cent to it and send it to the Treasury . It will be one per cent during 1937 , 1938 , 1939 . After that it will increase half a per cent every three years until it reaches three per cent for employee and three per cent for employer , or a total of six per cent . This tax will be paid on the salaries of 26 million persons and hence will yield enormous sums . The taxes paid will rise with the years . To give some idea of this , the following table gives the sums which will be collected and the benefits which will be paid in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that the receipts will he sufficient to pay the benefits until 1970 when they will fall 100 million short . In 1980 they will be $1,200,000,000 too small . But by 1980 this reserve accumulation will have grown to 47 billion dollars and the interest on that ? The benefit payments begin in 1942 . Before that only small refunds will be made to beneficiaries who die before benefits are payable . will be $1,406,000,000 a year or enough to cover the deficit . On the face of things , if you arc one of those people given to the bad habit of tossing off decisions on grave problems without reflection you will say nothing could be juster and sounder than this . That 's the way it looked to the President . That 's the way it still looks to him . But let us take a second look and see what we can see . III Now in order to follow this you must see how the reserve is now working in actual practice . The plan began in 1936 with the one per cent tax for boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collections amounted to $910,165,940.84 . Now what has become of this money ? It has gone into the Treasury . As no pensions are payable until 1942 , no pensions have been paid ? only some refunds on account of death and the expenses of administration . The balance ? some 817 million dollars ? has been transferred to the reserve , called the Oki Age Account . That is just an account in the Treasury . From there it has been transferred to the general funds of the Treasury . That is , the Treasury " borrowed " it and transferred to the Account its own bonds . Having borrowed the money , the Treasury is at liberty to use it as it chooses . It has spent the money on the general expenses of the government . Thus , as matters stand , the money is gone ? spent ; the Old Age Account or reserve has 817 million dollars of government I.O.U . ' s and the government owes the Account 817 million dollars . The explanation of this , of course , is that when needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Age Account . Meantime it will pay interest at three per cent each year . Each year the amount in the reserve will be greater . And each year the government will pay three per cent interest on that reserve . All the money will be loaned to the government . Hence all of it will bear interest at the rate of three per cent . Thegovernment will collect taxes to pay the interest . But it will promptly borrow the interest just as it borrows the principal . And so by 1980 the government will have collected in old age taxes and in interest 111 billion dollars . By that time it will have paid out in benefits 64 billion dollars . There will be 47 billion remaining in the reserve . Of course there will be no money there ? but just 47 billion of government paper . But why should anyone worry about this ? What could be better than U. S. government I.O.U . ' s ? Let us see . To understand this we have to be dear about the true character of savings . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather loosely . One may save a thousand dollars . But one 's savings do not continue to be a thousand dollars . There is only one way to save a thing and that is to save it . You save a thousand bushels of wheat by putting it into your bin or into a warehouse . You save a thousand dollars by putting it into a tin box or a bank vault . If you use your thousand dollars to buy a New York City bond or a Santa Fe Railroad bond , your savings are no longer a thousand dollars . They are now in the form of a claim on the City of New York or the Santa Fe Railroad . You no longer have dollars but claims ? perfectly good claims , to be sure . But the distinction is important , as you will see . The investment is a claim to interest each year at a fixed rate and to the payment of $1,000 when the bond falls due . If I lend $1,000 in money to the United States government on a bond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as good , perhaps better because it draws yearly interest of three per cent , which the money can never do . But I no longer have the thousand dollars . Speaking casually I may say my savings are $1,000 , but what I have is a claim for $1,000 and interest against the United States government . The distinction may seem a fine one , but you will see at once the seriousness of it if you will consider that the value of the claim must depend on the person on whom the claim is established . Consider for a moment the following performance and please do not think it irrelevant . Each week you save ten dollars . You put it in a tin box marked " Reserve . " In a year you have $520 . You wish to put it to work . You lend it to a friend who is in business , who is solvent , and who agrees to pay you six per cent . He gives you a note which goes into the box . Each year you save $520 plus the interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the reserve box the promissory notes of your friend covering his borrowings of your savings and the interest , all amounting to nearly $8,000 . You may say you have saved $8,000 . But what you have will be claims for $8,000 in loans and interest against your debtor . Now suppose you handle your savings in the following manner . You put ten dollars a week in the tin hox marked " Reserve . " In a year it amounts to $520 . From time to time you need money . Instead of borrowing from a bank or a friend you decide to borrow it from your reserve . You take out a hundred dollars and put in your I.O.U . as a man may do in his petty cash drawer . You continue faithfully saving the ten dollars a week for ten years . You continue at intervals to borrow what you have saved . You put in I.O.U . ' s and bind yourself to return the money with interest at six per cent to the box . You are very faithful with your and your bookkeeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tin box your own promissory notes to the amount of nearly $8,000 . You may say you have saved $8,000 . But what you have is $8,000 in claims ? upon yourself . If they were claims upon your friend they would be paid to you out of your friend 's earnings . But being claims on yourself they must be paid back out of your earnings . It is not necessary to press this seemingly simple transaction any further . For it is very obvious that you have no savings ; that you have nothing . The " reserve " you have created is a pure fiction . The dollars in your little tin box are phantom dollars . It is through this seemingly foolish performance that we can now see the fallacy of comparing a government old-age annuity system with a private insurance company , and a government reserve with a private insurance company reserve . Let us apply this test . The International Insurance Company puts aside ten million dollars a year in its reserve . That ten million it invests each year in the bonds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten years it has over /00 million dollars of claims against various corporations and public bodies . It has an annual income of perhaps four million dollars in interest . An insurance company has two sources of revenue ? from its policy-holders and from its investments . It has claims for premiums on its policy-holders which . must be paid out of their pockets . It has claims for interest upon the corporations which must come out of their earnings . An investment is a means of adding to your own earnings part of the earnings of another person . It is not a device for merely ear-marking part of your own earnings . Therefore each year the International has the revenues collected from its policy-holders plus what it collects from the earnings of various corporations against which it has claims . If at any time it should run into difficulties , if policy-holders ' revenues should decline in hard times , the International could meet its obligations by drawing upon its reserves , by using the interest or by converting the reserves into cash . It could , in short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the resources of its policyholders . Now suppose the International put its surplus into a tin box marked " Reserve . " Then suppose it needed money from time to time and borrowed from its reserve , putting bonds into the tin box . At the end of ten years it would have in its tin box a hundred million of its own bonds bearing interest . Would this be a reserve ? Would the International really have savings of a hundred million ? Would it not have in reality merely a tin box full of claims upon itself , which would mean claims upon its policyholders ? In other words , instead of having claims upon the earnings of others it would merely have claims upon its own earnings . And is it not as plain as a pikestaff that it does not have to have a tin box full of to have claims upon its own earnings ? It has those claims anyhow . Of course it is not possible to imagine an insurance company engaging in a farce-comedy of this sort . If it did it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would probably be indicted . Yet this is precisely what the government is now doing through the Social Security Board and the Treasury . The Social Security Board is merely a large government-operated insurance company . But it is also merely a department of the federal government . So is the Treasury Department . The acts of both are merely the acts of the government . When , therefore , the government puts aside a billion dollars in a year in a box marked " Reserve " and then borrows that billion , substituting its promises to pay in the form of bonds , and then pays interest each year on these billions and borrows it , giving bonds in its place , what it will have at the end of forty-three years will he a box full of bonds ? claims , not upon some outside assets , but upon itself ; which , of course , are no claims at all . It has no means of getting the funds or the interest upon the funds save by going to the very people from whom it took these funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus insured , 26 million of them , who constitute the chief part of the population which must bear the taxes . If the government invested these billions in the bonds of some other government or some private corporations so that it could realize on the investment out of the earnings of some other entity than itself , then it might claim to have a reserve . But of course no one would suggest doing this . In short , there is no reserve . There will be no reserve . The whole thing is a solemn and cruel farce . IV One reason assigned for this most singular device is the need for relieving future generations of the burden of supporting all of the heavy load when pensions reach their full dimensions . The idea that we can relieve future generations by taxing this one and spending now the taxes collected and then repaying the loan in the future by taxing future generations is too fantastic for serious discussion . But it leads to an important fact which we must face . A public old-age insurance plan can be financed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can not escape it . The object of an old-age insurance plan is to provide the aged with the necessities of life . These necessities will have to be produced at the time they are distributed . In other words we shall not save those necessities against the day of need . In any given year those under 65 must produce enough for themselves and also enough for those who are retired and who produce nothing . However , as our method of distributing goods is by means of money , workers under 65 must create in any given period enough money income for themselves and , in addition , the sum needed for the aged . To put the matter differently , whatever is paid out to the annuitants in any given period will have to he collected out of the workers in that period by means of taxes . We can not doubt this if we will look at the way it works out in practice . In the year 1960 the actuaries estimate that the government will have to pay out $1,379 , - 900,000 in benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total of $1,481,900,000 . But in that year it will collect $2,041,200,000 from the insured and their employers as premiums . No one will doubt that all this money will he collected in the period in which it is paid out . In other words , 1960 will pay for the 1960 benefits . But in 1970 it will he different . The benefits will amount to $2,303,500,000 and The table used on an earlier page of this discussion was offered not as an ideal schedule of rates , but merely to illustrate the discrepancy between the present exorbitant rates and rates that would be sufficient to pay the benefits authorized in the present act . The rates should be somewhat higher because the benefits should be higher at least in the early years of the plan . Instead of a two per cent total tax on employers and employees increasing by one per cent every three years and rising to six per cent by 1949 , the original rates of one per cent rising by one per cent every five years , attaining to five per cent by 1957 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the needed payments up to 1970 and a reserve of perhaps ten billion dollars besides . But if the benefits were increased in the earlier years the reserve would be kept to a low and manageable level . Of course some reserve is inescapable a billion or two or even three or four . But the question would be well worth considering whether investment of such reserves ought not to be limited to the open bond market to prevent a political government from exploiting the reserve as part of the public fiscal policies . Congress and labor , as well as the employers , will do well to face this problem squarely and honestly in this session . There is going to be no end of pension tinkering . Behind every crackpot scheme of politicians competing for the votes of the aged will be the problem of money ? . where to get the money . This reserve fund offers a tempting reservoir of money upon which they will cast hungry eyes . Already the housing advocates have made a bid for it . Mr. Roosevelt thinks it looks good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim to it . The best thing to do with this monstrous child is to slay it at once and thus frustrate the kidnapers.
