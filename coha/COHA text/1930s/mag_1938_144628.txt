Prime sample of Nazi conjuring at the anti-Schuschnigg exhibit at Tulln last week was a goggling , cadaver-like effigy of the former Chancellor cruelly tagged " Comical Kurt .

Meanwhile , still a closely-watched prisoner in his Belvedere Castle , Herr Schuschnigg was being permitted the comfort of daily visits from his blonde , 34-year-old fiancee , Countess Vera Fugger von Babenhausen , whose talent for fine music was Schuschnigg 's solace following the death of his wife in a motor crash three years ago .

" He probably would not be able to walk the streets for a minute without being attacked by a furious crowd . The world would then say the Nazis killed him . "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
