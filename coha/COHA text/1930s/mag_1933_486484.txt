It has long been and long will be impossible to refer to the late Mr. Reed without calling him the Speaker . As Seward was always Governor to Lincoln , so the masterful Speaker of 1889- ' 91 forever linked his name to the office . The fierce controversies which raged about his innovations on old practice have now abated , and we can calmly weigh his action with something of the serene impartiality of history . Looking back upon his break with the ancient law and tradition of the House , we do not see to-day , any more than we could see at the time , how it can be denied that his audacity was revolutionary . The particular vice of his attitude was that , in order to obtain authority regularly , he assumed it irregularly ; in order to enable his party to make a new rule , he himself made it off-hand . In other words , he counted a quorum in older to make it lawful to count a quorum , That was essentially a revolution in parliamentary practice , and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speaker Reed 's original act . Nor does the later record of Congress , under the " Reed rules , " satisfactorily bear out the exaggerated claims made in his behalf . He himself , in characteristic but dangerously sarcastic phrase , thanked God that the House of Representatives had " ceased to be a deliberative assembly . " What he meant was , that a weapon had been forged to force Congress to vastly greater expedition in a vastly greater amount of business . But an inspection of the Congressional Record will put a quietus on the pretension . As a matter of fact , the House sees as many bills sink into the grave as before , wastes as much time , and has as meagre a product to show for the labors of a session . We have always to bear in mind the simple truth that Congress is one of those bodies of which it can be said that , the more you change it , the more it remains the same thing . It is not in the rules of the House , but in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation lie . " You think , " said Congressman Cannon once , in a burst of angry candor , " that because I am Chairman of the Committee on Appropriations , it is my business to make appropriations . But my duty really is to prevent them from ' being made . " Somewhat the same may be said of the House as a whole . Perhaps its most important function is to put a hook in the nose of impetuous legislators . If every heady and hurrying Representative could drop a crude bill in the slot and draw out an enacted law , there would be an end of a stable social order . Congress has to deliberate in spite of itself . It has to compel individual or sectional interests to sub mit to the consensus of the whole country . That is a thing which could not be done by a Congressional machine turning out statutes as a press throws off printed sheets . Speaker Reed did not really create such a machine , despite the loud assertions of the time ; and it is just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majority 's having its way sharply and decisively when it knew what it really wanted ; but in the matter of sheer " efficiency , " judged by the amount of work done and the time consumed in doing it , he left the House very much where he found it . It was , after all , the personal quality of the man , more than his actual public service , which gave him a place apart . He was that rare phenomenon among ambitious politicians in a democracy  --  a man with positive convictions and a tongue that spared neither friend nor foe . He seemed , in his reckless use of biting speech , to have taken to heart the advice which Talleyrand gave to Thiers : " You wish to rise ; make enemies . " It was partly , no doubt , the temptation of his own incisive wit . He could puncture absurdity and inflated humbug as quickly as he perceived them , and he never found it in his heart to refrain . Almost at the very beginning of his Congressional career , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied to him to secure them some condemned cannon . by endorsing on their letter of application , " I am not in the old junk business " He could not stay his hand , on such fit occasion . From that moment until the day when , scorning to " flatter crime where it sits throned in brief omnipotence , " he levelled his sarcasms at a flaunting Imperialism , he was typically the American in public life who had a mind of his own and spoke it pungently . The political success which Mr. Reed won is really the best proof of an unusual ability , beyond that of a mere master of flouts and gibes . A democracy does not readily warm to a public man who ridicules its follies . One whose words " crystallize into epigrams as they touch the air , " must be able to convince men that he has weight as well as wit if he rises by the suffrages of a people who so like to be flattered , and whom it is so easy to flatter  --  as easy as lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Reed , go far ; and he has a title to distinction in the fact that his supporters saw more in him than the sharp tongue which made them wince even while they voted for him . Almost equally remarkable is it for a public man to retire voluntarily , as he did , without moroseness or bitterness . He never concealed his opinion of President McKinley or of the methods by which the.nomination of that gentleman was secured in 1896 ; yet it was not with the sourness of a disappointed man , but with the proud sense of an intellect and character superior to base time-serving , that he spoke of the men who had risen to power through sedulously consulting the tastes of the " strong beast " under which Plato figured the populace , and declaring that whatever it wanted was the deepest wisdom and the highest morality . Some one asked Mr. Reed not long ago if he had not greatly missed the fascinations of public life He replied frankly that he had feared he should do so , and did not know but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far " the Lord had been good " to him , and had preserved him from that misfortune . Such a cheerful temper , in retirement from great power . is as infrequent as it is admirable . There was undoubtedly in the man a strain of shrewd and sturdy Americanism , of the old-fashioned sort . This it was which made it impossible to trick him with the glamour of our latter-day Imperialism He was too solidly based to be swept away by the rush of newfangled doctrines which came with the Spanish war . He laughed at them ; he parodied them ; he poured out his irony upon them ; he turned them to ridicule , and transfixed their champions with the darts of his sarcasm ; but deep down in his heart he was filled with a sincere and patriotic grief that his countrymen should seem for a time to be running after those tawdry glories . A sinewy Yankee , smacking of the soil , he took his place beside that other racy product of our native earth , Mark Twain , in employing the arsenal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hour which would introduce the new Empire into old Americanism . It is his unyielding opposition to that folly , and the calm confidence " with which he looked to see it fall in ruin , that made his later years the most truly serviceable of all his life , and that deepen the regret we feel that such a man  --  so ill spared  --  should have been taken away before filling the measure of his days .
