Karl Berngardovich Radek , the greatest journalist in Soviet Russia , repeatedly in recent years the spokesman of Joseph Stalin , and in recent months so potent that Moscow correspondents were calling him " the Second Foreign Commissar , " was admitted by the Soviet Commissariat of Justice last week to be in jail awaiting trial for his life . Famed Journalist Radek ( n Sobelsohn ) suddenly " disappeared ' " last month and neither his paper Izvestia ( " News " ) , the official daily of the Soviet Government , nor any other Moscow organ printed a line as to the whereabouts of Communism 's most popular commentator . According to such Red newsorgans abroad as the Manhattan Daily Worker Comrade Radek has a " dazzling talent greater probably than that of any other Communist journalist " and has ever been " a passionate partisan of the masses . " Therefore last week the World proletariat was startled , to say the least , when Sovie Public Prosecutor Andrei Vishinsky accused Prisoner Radek of " political and legal guilt " in connection with the alleged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot " 16 Bolsheviks were recently shot ( TIME , Aug. 31 ) , the most prominent being Lenin 's old comrades Zinoviev ( n Apfelbaum ) and Karnenev ( n Rosenfeld ) . <P> Bolshevik males who happen to dislike Journalist Radek and the small fringe of whiskers around his round face have called him " that ugly little Jewish monkey . " Once his name was mentioned by defendants in the recent Plot-Against-Stalin trial , farcical though that was , the Soviet Commissariat for Internal Affairs set secret police to see what they could " get " on Radek . In Russia such agents seldom fail on such assignments . The object in this case was to link Radek with Stalin 's enemy , Trotsky . <P> As usual , Journalist Radek was one smart jump ahead of his enemies . Just before he " disappeared " he managed to get printed in Izvestia , above his signature , a scorching editorial in which he flayed Trotsky and demanded Death for all " decaying-souled traitors . " In this editorial Comrade Radek claimed that he personally sabotaged and foiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was expected last week to constitute Prisoner Radek 's chief defense in court . It was typical of Soviet justice that , even after Radek 's arrest had been admitted , Russian newspapers carried no details of the charges against him , and even privileged foreign correspondents in Moscow were not permitted to discover when or where the Kremlin 's erstwhile newspundit will be tried . <P> With the fate of Radek an official mystery , Communists and others recalled events of his recent fame . It was Radek who announced to Russia that " President Roosevelt as a private citizen has been a friend of the Soviet . " The first public champagne toast to Mr. Roosevelt drunk by Soviet officials in Moscow was at a party organized by Radek to celebrate the appointment as U. S. Ambassador to Russia of William Christian Bullitt , now U. S. Ambassador to France . It was Journalist Radek who interviewed Mr. Bullitt in Moscow in 1932 and quoted him as saying : " In all the world stalks destruction .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
