txt An insurance plan providing funds for the unemployed , based on obligatory personal savings , was outlined by Thomas F. Tarbell , president of the Casualty Actuarial Society , at its semiannual meeting at the Hotel Statler today . This plan would provide the unemployed individual with funds during the period immediately following cessation of employment from causes beyond his control , Mr. Tarbell said . Under the plan , the speaker explained , a certain percentage of weekly wages would be required ' to be deposited to the credit of the individual employee with a financial agency until a sufficient reserve would be accumulated to provide unemployment benefits at a specified rate for a certain period . Mr Tai bell , who is also actuary of the Traveleih ' Insurance Company of Hartford , Conn. , said his proposal would include supplementary contributions by the employer at times of dismissal to the extent of two weeks of pay and the payment of administration expenses of the plan by the State . The contributions , he said , uould amount to 5 per cent of each employee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had accumulated sufficient to provide benefits for at least 13 weeks , and for a total of 15 weeks with the two weeks ' salary from the employer . Two objections which the speaker said might accrue from this plan were that an act establishing such a plan might be regarded as unconstitutional , and that in some industries the wage scale is so low as to pie-vent employees from laying aside 5 per cent of their wages . While the first question could not be determined by actual test , Mr. Tarbell said , except perhaps in the courts , the second problem emphasizes the fact that social justice demands a wage scale which will permit necessities of life commen-urate with present-day standards . Under Mr. Tarbell 's plan , banks , trust companies , and possibly insurance agencies would be allowed to act as depositary agents . He pointed out the need for strict regulation regarding investments . Such funds , the speaker said , would have to be segregated from general funds and only securities possessing the maximum of security and marketability should be specified as eligible security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
