" You must concentrate , dear , " purred a U. S. woman spectator to freckled , 18-year-old Patricia Jane ( " Patty " ) Berg last week as they strode down a fairway of the seaside golf course at Southport , England . " I am concentrating hard , " tearfully replied U. S. Golfer Berg , " but nothing happens . " In spite of concentration , by the 18th hole Patty had missed five putts of less than five feet , lost her second-round match to Elsie Corlett of Lancashire . Other favorites fell even more quickly than Patty , whom British bookmakers had backed as the No. 1 U. S. entrant in the Women 's British Golf Championship , never won by a U. S. player . Mrs. Glenna Collett Vare , five-time contender for the title , lost her temper , then her first-round match to her close friend Charlotte Glutting . Defending Champion Wanda Morgan was also eliminated in the opening round . As it turned out , best of all the ladies was London 's 19-year-old Pamela ( " Pam " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patty Berg . Husky , handsome , red headed , she reached the final in 1934 and 1935 , lost both times . This year , against 24-year-old Bridget Newell , England 's youngest Justice of the Peace , Pam shot a competent 79 in the morning , finished the first 18 holes 3 up . In the afternoon she poled out tremendous drives , went triumphantly on to win 7 &; 5.
