GOOD-BY TO THE SUPERINTENDENT A STORY BY ELIZABETH SHEPLEY SERGEANT T HE Indian Boarding School Superin- tendent , inside a roped-off greensward on the school campus , was about to be offered a silver coffee urn on a bed of yellow satin . Desiderio , who had established himself inconspicuously in an angle of the nearest gray-stone building , watched attentively the milling crowd of employees in their best summer clothes settle into expectant silence . With his big Indian nose thrust over his narrow chin and his Sunday shirt , the dark-skinned boy noted with yearning that the gray kindly eyes of his " Father " ( so he always called his Superintendent in his heart ) filled up with tears as he listened to the presentation speech of the next in rank . " Miss him though we shall , we can not regret his going on to higher duties , " reeled off the spokesman in a well-oiled voice . Mr. Pomf'et , he do n't want to go , thought Desiderio resentfully , rubbing his hand across his lips . The hand was thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the resentment he was trying to wipe off was of the sad , not the angry kind . Why should another tribe get our Superintendent ? Why ? Because Washington said so . Washington was Fate with a capital F. But the lanky , white-headed Superintendent , whom Washington sent to the Middle of the World Tribe ten years ago and was now withdrawing , accepted the urn suavely , solemnly , and thankedthe donors in a few well-chosen words . When " Father " stood up there , under the bright blue sky , so tall , so limber and so firm , thanking those who loved him and those who loved him not , Desiderio felt pride mount in him like a stream in flood . All the same Mr. Pomf'ct did not look quite right to him . His hands had a queer jerky movement . Did he know there were those who wanted him to leave ? Who cussed when asked to contribute to the Testimonial ? In the corner of the grimy shop , behind the flying sparks with their steely smell , Desiderio had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of adaptation to changing Indian commissioners and shifting policies had trained Mr. Pomfret to keep plenty of knowledge under his gray felt hat . With a handsome gesture he passed the classic urn to his little round , elderly wife , and watched her clasp it tight against her new egg-shell blue knit dress . He had never been able to give Maria silver . When " Father " looked at something , Desiderio 's earnest and innocent gaze followed instinctively . He thought Mrs. Pomfret looked nice holding that urn . Her face was all wrinkled , like his mother 's when he brought her candy from town . The " Home Ec . " teacher , her special friend , looked happy too , the slanted Oriental eyes observed . Desiderio had seen Miss Teal bustling round the campus , collecting quarters and dimes and dollars . She was a bustler , that lady . He said it in Indian but that was what he meant . Now she bustled off , to start her pupils , the Home Ec . girls of the Twelfth Grade , serving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nostrils might be flattened and Chinese-looking , but they could always snuff out party food . Aware of his own failing , the good brown boy sunk his backbone deeper into the angle of the wall behind the forsythia bush . His girl , Marina , must not suspect him of thirsting for the fruit punch she was serving in little glasses with handles . He saw her , in there , in a school-made white dress , with a natty little jacket , looking almost like a white girl he thought , in the midst of the people round the Superintendent . He was n't sure he wanted her to look like a white girl . Now she was staggering over the lawn , in her pin-heel pumps , with a tray of ice-cream dishes . That was no way for an Indian girl to walk ! And she kept patting self-consciously the hedge of stiff curls that bordered her face . The hair of a Middle of the World woman must lie flat and smooth and shiny to her head and she must always seem modest and quiet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm silly smile to the Boys ' Adviser  --  that one-eighth Cherokee ! Desiderio 's government shoe , a secret partner in his conflicts , gave an involuntary kick against the stone of the house-wall . Looking down , he found he had stepped heavily on one of Mrs. Pomfret 's cherished pansy plants . The sight dismayed him . Mrs. Pomfret had put so much water on those plants . Still , the next Superintendent 's wife would not like pansies . He had heard the cook say so yesterday . She would dig up the pansies , throw them out on the dump heap , and plant cosmos . So the cook said . The government employees , white , pale-brown , deep brown , within the sacred eating place , were now handing back to the Indian girls punch glasses stuck over with cherry peel , and white platessLobbed with streams of sickly pink . They were crowding up to Mr. and Mrs. Pomfret , to say the last good-by . Some ducked under the rope , instead of waiting in the shake-hand line . Those were Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more . He was being " transferred . " Desiderio averted his eyes from their bad manners , their meanness , and vowed to avoid them on the path of his life . It would be prudent to edge a little nearer now . Absently stripping a branch off the Superintendent 's most valued shrub , he cautiously approached the rope . To his disgust , an old Indian of his own village was ahead of him , clinging to it with talonlike brown hands . " What you doin ' here ? " inquired Desiderio gruffly in his home speech . Red Eagle , dressed in a discarded army outfit , with his two long gray braids wrapped in otterskin , made no answer and just kept on staring at Mr. Pomfret , tall as a tree , shaking hands with his former subordinates . The old man 's eyes , whose lids rose in a point like a setter dog 's , stared full of trouble . At last he replied , in English , turning to look at the youngster with full dignity : " I  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did not need to be too polite . The old man was of the other " fraction . " Not of his group . " He give me this clo'es , " added Red Eagle proudly , almost tenderly . Then with sudden fire : " What you doin ' here , you-sell ? " Desiderio evaded the issue by dodging round to the other side of the rope . He had decided in his mind that Red Eagle was there to beg the Superintendent to help his niece keep her job at the Hospital  --  the job that fed him . Desiderio 's group wanted that job now . He 'd tell his uncle what the old fox was after . Most of the guests had now departed , leaving a trampled empty space which Mr. Pomfret 's close friends were doing their best to fill . Desiderio thought they all looked scared . He knew why . He was scared too . When a Superintendent is moved all the lower-downs feel insecure . " I 'll be the next , " muttered the History teacher to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Desiderio 's heart gave a rough leap against his ribs . It had been doing that all day  --  ever since the Superintendent had called him to his office and said his school job was not to be continued . He knew " Father " did not like to say it . For he had been encouraging him to save his money to go to a " Diesel school . " " You better try to get a job in town . You try all the garages and say I sent you . " It was no good . They would never employ Indian mechanics . He would have to go back to his village . He did n't want to . His own father was dead , his mother a widow , and her house , one room , was full of pottery , cooking pots , and children . The School had been his country for ten whole years . First the grades and then the auto-mechanic shop . But maybe Mr. Pomfret would listen to his plea . He had thought of something . Mrs. Pomfret now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ec . teacher , carrying the silver urn in its shiny white box . Her face , still frozen into its mold of pleasantness , was beginning to break up into the lines which any sixty-year-old face assumes when asked to move out of the house it has settled in . Lost in her own problem , she suddenly saw the downcast Desiderio , waiting patiently , implacably , obviously to see the Superintendent . " There 's that boy , " she murmured to her friend . Desiderio nodded respectfully to Mrs. Pomfret , though he had long since sensed her resistance to his intimacy with the Superintendent . The Pomfrets had no children and she had not liked his coming and his sitting in her living room at night , reading books from " Father 's " shelves . But " Father " had said : " You just come in and read till I get back . " Fortunately , women did not matter . He had to think women negligible right now . For the Superintendent , there inside the rope , was surrounded by the Twelfth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every one by name and thank her for the good feast , with no difference of manner to those who had given him trouble . He was encouraged by the way the Superintendent squared his shoulders , and strode along to the exit on his long gray legs . A man of authority . Fearless man . A man who could adapt himself to any horse 's pace , the old Indians said , and veil his eyes in any dust storm , without losing his keen vision . These traits the old men admired . But what they relied on , as De , siderio well knew , was that their Superintendent had a tender heart . " Hullo , boy , " said the Superintendent , with unconscious sternness , perceiving the tragic intentness of the slanted , shiny eyes that awaited him . " Hullo , " responded Desiderio faintly . His mouth was so full of his heart feelings that he could barely articulate . The Superintendent hesitated , then said : " Do you want to ask me something , Desiderio ? " " Yessir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He felt hurried inside , because he could feel Red Eagle stealing up on them . But it would be a shame  --  to show hurry . " Well ? " " I want ask you take me with you . To new Reservation . I drive your car ? " he inquired , hopefully . For he still had the unconscious belief he would be taken care of . The Superintendent 's wrinkled-parchment face contracted . His gray eyes narrowed . He spoke in a voice which Desiderio recognized as exasperation : " Now , boy  --  you know I drive my own car . Besides there are no funds for such things . You know that , Desiderio . You know I have to employ my own Indians wherever I am . " Desiderio said nothing but his bearing expressed pain , such extreme pain that the Superintendent winced . Though ac-tually his situation was changing without his own inner consent , he felt like a man deserting a devoted family . And in this enormous family this was the child who most needed him . " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " asked Mr. Pomfret , wearily " He do want , " said Desiderio evasively . " Did you try in town , as I told you to ? " Desiderio ducked his chin . " Mmm  --  well , I can recommend  --  but my successor will have his own ideas and choices . You 've been employed two years in this school . The government ca n't give jobs to all Indians . " This last truism , which he spoke one hundred times a day , so often that he thought it should be written on his tombstone , irked Mr. Pomfret horribly when applied to Desiderio , who seemed like any other Middle-of-the-World boy and yet was not . " I do n't want stay , you go . " Desiderio 's body was quiet and his voice fiat , but his right arm was acutely lashing his pants leg with that forsythia switch . The Superintendent , who had a creed that campus bushes must be treated with kindness , smothered the reproval that leaped to his lips . Let the bushes go ! But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of school and find themselves jobs as white boys do . Desiderio was beginning to sag now . But when Mr. Pomfret shook his head impatiently and started toward his house , he trailed along . " When you go ? " he asked " Father , " in a thick guttural tone , perceiving that Red Eagle was stalking them . The Superintendent half paused and looked at his house , a nondescript stone structure which stood a little apart from the row of lesser employee houses at the hack of the campus , crowded upon by other buildings in varying and mostly tasteless architectural styles , planned long since in the depths of the Department of the Interior without regard to environment . " To-morrow morning , " he said clearing his throat and not believing it . For hisunaesthetic house was dear to him . He had hoped to live there till he was retired , in the midst of this so knowledgeable Indian people , who loved him like their own . " I come say you good-by , six o'clock ? " Mr. Pomfret cleared his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round the villages to-night . All the Governors seemed to have last matters on their minds . I sent word I 'd be out . Could you get your clothes and come along ? I 'd drop you at San Rafael . " Desiderio clasped his left arm over his head , where his stiff black hair stood up in a shock . He stared trustingly at Mr. Pomfret , a slow gleam of happiness cutting the somber arc of his eyes . " OK . How soon you go ? " " Just time to change my suit . " Desiderio gazed thoughtfully at " Father 's " swell spring suit , and felt consoled that even a Superintendent must change to work clothes . Otherwise how would he make out ? " Mr. Pomfet , " piped a voice behind them . " I  --  me ? " Desiderio slid off and soon began to run , reaching in a jiffy the Boys ' Dormitory , with its scarified red-brick walls . Under the name of a past Commissioner , blazoned over the door , he entered a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was glad to be alone , and moving adroitly about the room he shared with three others , piled his work pants and his two shirts and his walk shoes and wrapped them in a clean white-cotton cloth his mother had given him , and tied the corners tight . Back he shot to the gray stone house , where the roadster stood ready and Mr. Pomfret , still in his gray suit , with one foot on the porch steps , was listening to Red Eagle . " I wo n't forget , " he heard Mr. Pomfret say soothingly . " I know you need the money . You 're getting on in years . " Then he shook Red Eagle cordially by the hand , and the Old One , his face wrinkling , embraced his Chief about the shoulders and lowered his own head , till his braids dropped on the Superintendent 's blue shirt front . To avoid this display of feeling , Desiderio quietly stowed his pack in the bottom of the rumble seat . " Where you gain ' ? " demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slammed the door smartly , inserted his key , which was tied to a lucky rabbit foot beaded by an Indian friend , and started his engine . " Jump in . " Oh , Father . You let me sit with you , thought Desiderio . " Like to go along , Red Eagle ? Get in the rumble seat . Nice and cool out there . " " I  --  me stay till to-morrow mo'nin ' , " the old man answered sagely , after a perceptible pause , during which a shrewd expression alighted on the crisscross folds round his eyes and clung there like a bird to a fence-rail . Old coyote . Thinks he get more pants . Mrs. Pomfret came out on the porch , a bungalow apron over her egg-shell blue , and looked reproachfully at the gray suit . " Back soon , Mr. Pomfret ? " " Not so soon , dear . Going for a last drive . Around the villages . Midnight probably . " Mrs. Pomfret turned quickly into the house then quavered , as the screen door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might be screen or might be tears : " Your supper , Mr. Pomfret . The packing . " " Do n't want supper , dear . Pack when I get home . " He stepped on the gas , shifted gears in swift succession , and swirled violently out of the school grounds , into the highway , amazing Desiderio . His " Father , " a very careful man , always went out of that gate in low . Soon they were out of town , beyond all houses , on the northern highway that curved round the base of the high mountains . It was dusky , almost dark now . The evening star , the planet Venus , wasrising in the west , displaying as she came her amorous bright rays . The lanky seasoned white man , and the dusky , warm , inarticulate young primitive beside him , gazed at her together , from within the hood of the car , stirred unconsciously by the almost sunlike radiance she spread over the vast and lonely sky which confronted them like a back-drop . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with iridescent color . The Superintendent was realizing for the first time fully that , pilgrim though he was , and must be  --  for the Indian Service seldom allowed a man to pause long enough to feel himself rooted  --  he had permitted himself to become attached . Desiderio , though he had instinctively drawn about him as the distance from school grew his blanket of inherited stoicism , was worrying again about his " Father 's " hands . It was still light enough to observe them . They were usually so firm and quiet . Now they kept clasping and unclasping on the wheel . Dry hands . Old-Iooking hands . Fishing up the canyon last Sunday , he had seen the bright green shoots of the Douglas spruce ( his people called them the flowers of the spruce ) at the end of every branch . His people honored this great forest tree . They carried its branches in all ceremonies . Desiderio , who thought of his Superintendent as this very tree , wished he could find some medicine to give " Father 's " hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice letter you wrote me , Desiderio , " said the Superintendent at last out of the dark . " You made me proud . " Desiderio swallowed and said nothing . " You know we men in the Indian Service do n't expect gratitude . We are here to do our duty . But when a boy  --  if someone  --  well  --  appreciates the service we try to give  --  we 're glad  --  that 's all . " Getting this out at last , the Superintendent could add : " I hope you 'll get to go to the Diesel school . The boys who can drive caterpillars are always needed  --  and make good money . " " Ai n't got ' nough money save up for go school . " " Have n't got , " the Superintendent corrected by habit . " Haven ' got . " " No-1 appreciate that . I 'm sorry , boy . But maybe you could get a job  --  say at Tamarisk garage , near home ? " Desiderio 's eyelids closed over his eyes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . . . . " " Marina , my girl , she want get married , " said Desiderio suddenly . " My mother , my uncle , she say come home , get married , start farmin ' , if you ai n't smart ' nough keep you gov'ment job . But my mother 's land , it no good . Not ' nough water . Do n't give a beilyfull . " " I fear so , " said Mr. Pomfret , hurriedly . . . . " You know I 'll always care to hear from you , Desiderio . You can write me , to the new Reservation . You can let me know how things are . . . . You might be a leader , boy . Those factions at San Rafael  --  they 're bad things . Try to see what the educated boys can do about those factions . " " Why you go , Mr. Pomfret ? We think ou fix it , that fraction . You know my peoples , they fights too much . I ca n't help . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Mr. Pomfret half-heartedly . " Why you leave my peoples ? My peoples , they say if Mr. Pomfret stay evy ' - thing be all right . " Mr. Pomfret made an impatient sound . This persistent refrain was killing him . " I ca n't help it  --  the system forces it . We live under army regulations in the Indian Service . " Then feeling ashamed , he added : " They judge I am badly needed elsewhere . " Desiderio was thinking fast now . For almost insensibly they were sliding through narrowing , lanelike roads into a dark square , surrounded by a block of fiat-roofed clay houses . The houses were almost all dark , as if everyone were already in bed . Under an ancient spreading cottonwood the Superintendent came to a stop , in the still deeper shadow . But at once there was a movement along the house doors . Like bees coming out of a hive , the men of the village began to swarm toward a car they knew well the sound of . Desiderio prepared to escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in respect , disappear . Besides , he was anxious to get home , for he had thought of something  --  something hidden under a beam in his mother 's house . He wanted to find it and give it to Mr. Pomfret . The Superintendent spoke low and sharp : " Desiderio  --  you get married . You try hard and build you a good house , like the model at school . Do n't drink , " he ended with authority , as the tribal leaders arrived and crowded jealously around him . The Superintendent had intended to stay only ten minutes , but it was half an hour before he could stave these fellows off , satisfy them in their hitter discontent at his leaving them . And even then the Governor clung to the running board , talking about the land transfers and the tractor  --  all the well-worn troubles . " Have you seen Desiderio , Governor ? " said Mr. Pomfret , peering into the dark . " You want ? " The Governor sent a messenger , summoned from across the square . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home with his things and gone out again . His mother did n't know where he was . Mr. Pomfret started his car mechanically and turned it into the dim winding road that led to the river . The second village , where the elders were waiting for him , was across the bridge and then a bit . The roadster , which Desiderio in the shop had put in fine trim for to-morrow 's long trip , shot down the hill onto the steel bridge that spanned mostly dry sands . In the middle of the bridge Mr. Pomfret came to a sudden stop . A dark figure had moved forward . Wrapped in a cotton blanket , with the headband of his people tied about his cropped boarding-school hair , Desiderio already looked changed , as he lifted his flat face under the stars . " Mr. Pomf'et . I bring you present . " With fingers that trembled a little , Mr. Pomfret accepted and examined under the dial light a small , deer skin case . Out of it he took a very smooth , elongated round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pointed at both ends . " What is it ? " he asked reverently , for he loved the ways of the Middle of the World people . " Deer stone . My father give me before he die . His father give him . You take . It good stone . Come out of deer stomach . Give good huntin ' . Give luck . " Mr. Pomfret felt of the deer fetich , rubbed smooth as satin by the age-old pressure of brown hands that still neededthe luck of the wilds . It fitted into his Ieft palm , under his folded knuckles , as if made to lie there . It felt alive too , alive and potent . As he softly rubbed it he felt his troubles being absorbed into it , carried back to Mother Nature to take care of . Still holding the stone in his left hand , Mr. Pomfret stretched his right hand out into the dark and met a warm broad palm , which shook a little and was quickly withdrawn . " Good-by  --  Father , " said Desiderio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken in his heart for a decade . " I 'll keep your luck right by me , Son , " said the Superintendent in a funny voice . TROUT IN SWIFT WATER BY EDWARD WEISMILLER M ISSHAPEN by the ragged stream , They take proportion in a dream Where cold whipped water and the sun Range them askew against a dun Fabric of sand and jutting stone Continuous to them alone . With strict composure they elide The pressure of the green goldtide , Whose ripples curve upon themselves And make the trout , above rock shelves , Appear to swim by halves and thirds With movements swift as hummingbirds ' . And yet the trout suppose awry The world above the stream ; they lie And watch morosely from their bed , While madmen curvet overhead .
