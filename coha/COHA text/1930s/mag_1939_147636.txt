Outside the U. S. Treasury last week , as usual , stood the time-mellowed , unsmiling bronze statue of First Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton . Inside , as usual , sat time-harried , unsmiling Henry Morgenthau Jr. , 50th Secretary . <P> On Mr. Morgenthau 's balding brow the cares of his office were writ large . Snappishly he told newsmen : " Every day we get that much closer to the limit , but . . . that 's Congress ' worry , not mine . I 'm not worrying about it , " said worried Mr. Morgenthau , " I 'm only the paymaster . " <P> What Mr. Morgenthau said he was not worrying about was the U. S. public debt , still climbing to alltime highs , now teetering at more than $41,168,000,000 . Another thing he was presumably not worrying about was the U. S. law which flatly forbids the public debt to go over $45,000,000,000 . Asked what he would do if &; when the 1940 fiscal tide lapped the public debt up around King Canute Congress ' shoes , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penny over the regular authority I 've got . " <P> U. S. newsmen , calculating roughly on their cuffs , figured that Mr. Morgenthau 's services to the Government would thus terminate in about nine months-unless Congress saw fit to move its chair back to higher ground . That move is just what the next session of Congress is expected to make , with only a modicum of fuss-but the Republican fuss can be counted on to be more than a modicum . <P> Congressional Canutes or no , the tide of national debt was still mounting . In the fiscal year 1939 the U. S. spent $3,600,000,000 more than was collected in taxes . Session III of the 76th Congress will face a probable new Army appropriation of about $1,700,000,000 , a new Navy appropriation of about $1,300,000,000 , plus a $275,000,000 deficiency appropriation . To meet this bill for national defense , while continuing to spend many millions on relief , works , etc. , the U. S. Treasury must raise new taxes , somehow , somewhere . And 1940 is an election year . To raise new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) broaden the income-tax structure , by lowering the tax-exemption rate to include thousands of U. S. citizens who now pay no income tax ; 2 ) lift the tax exemptions historically enjoyed by Federal , State and municipal bonds . <P> The latter dodge would be no great shakes as a revenue raiser . From the former , the most optimistic guesses would add $60,000,000 to the U. S. revenues . To Treasury experts , this amount may not be piddling , but it definitely is not enough . <P> Last week no Democrat , high or low , New or Old Deal , cared to take his political life in his hands , suggest brutal tax increases . The shadow of 1940 lay heavy on the grey Capitol , the gleaming White House . Ancient , ham-handed " Old Muley " Bob Doughton of North Carolina , chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , celebrated his 76th birthday , optimistically remarked that the war boom in business might obviate the need of new taxes .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
