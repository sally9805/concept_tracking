THE voluminous literature of prohibition , writers on both sides of the controversial fence have represented the speakeasy as a foul stain on our social escutcheon . To prove that crime , bestiality , and sordidness are the inseparable companions of Mr. Barleycorn , the drys are wont to illustrate their theses with word-pictures of the worst dives they can find . At the same time , to show that conditions under prohibition are intolerable , the wets make use of the same revolting illustrations . Caught thus , in a crossfire of opprobrium , the speakeasy has not , to employ a vulgarism , been given a very good break . Far be it from me to asperse the descriptive powers , the veracity , or the motives of other writers , wet or dry . I do not doubt that among the two hundred and twenty thousand or more speakeasies of this fair land many , perhaps most , are places into which a thoughtful debutante might well hesitate to introduce her mother . I am willing to believe the reports I have read of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children make and sell home-brews -- ranging from beer to various distillates of fruit and vegetable juices ? and to concede that such establishments may be inimical to the welfare of the nation . And I accept without cavil stories of the squalor , depravity , and general indecency that characterize the common run of illicit liquor dispensaries , from the beer flats of Wyoming to the so-called soft-drink parlors'of Ohio and Illinois , which purvey a low grade of corn whiskey known as " moon . " It is probable that they are as black as they have been painted . My only criticism of the speakeasy picture as usually drawn is that it is incomplete . Its delineators neglect to include certain types of establishments which ? save for the fact that they are operated contrary to law ? bear no resemblance to the noisome dens aforementioned . In the interest of social science , I propose to sketch in the missing portion of the picture , by describing the speakeasy de luxe , as found in New York . Whether or not its counterpart exists in many other communities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and one or two other cities may boast a few ; but , like most out-of-town imitations of New York institutions , theirs are but pallid copies of the originals . The speakeasy at its best is indigenous to Manhattan . Thither , at the risk of increasing the floating population of that tight little island , I shall presently conduct you . But only in fancy . The places I shall describe will be composite creations , drawn from life , yet hypothetical . Please do not write and ask me for their street numbers , for such requests will go unanswered . The speakeasy did not attain an assured position in New York society overnight . Like any other institution , it had to earn its place . In the first years of prohibition , before the illicit liquor traffic had become organized on a large scale and the protection system stabilized , the future of the speakeasy seemed precarious indeed . To begin with , the public was unaccustomed to the idea of violating laws ; and though the dry act specifically prohibited the sale of liquor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its purchase was equally illegal . While it is doubtless true that some persons derived a measure of enjoyment from the mere thought that they were participants in an outlaw enterprise , I think that to the majority the thought was distasteful . In those days a law was a law and a violator a criminal ; the ethical concept that breaking a sumptuary law is a venial sin had not yet been generally accepted . Among persons of position there was a feeling that while it was one thing to drink bootleg liquor in the privacy of one 's home , it was another to be seen buying and drinking it in public . Then , too , the duty of enforcement being at that time in the hands of the local police jointly with the Federal operatives , there was always the possibility that the speakeasy one chose might be raided and its patrons , as well as its staff , bundled into patrol wagons and haled into court , to the accompaniment of undesirable newspaper notoriety . To be interrupted in the middle of a meal and forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name and address was scarcely conducive to that tranquillity so essential to the enjoyment of food and drink . Coarse-grained individuals may have found that sort ofthing amusing , but there were others to whom it did not appeal . The frequency of raids created also other deterrents to speakeasy patronage . When you had invited friends to dinner at Joe 's , it was upsetting to find , on arriving there , that Joe 's had been put out of business . For in that early period the chances were that you did not know ? or were not known at ? any other establishment of equal merit . In those days when you discovered a place where the food was reasonably good and the liquor fit to drink you did n't , as a rule , experiment farther ; there was too great a risk of being poisoned . Still another deterrent was the nature of the speakeasies , which reflected that of their proprietors . The majority of the latter were underworld gentry , with everything to gain and nothing to lose , who had been drawn into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They knew little , if anything , and cared less , about commercial principles , ethics , or the building of good will . As for the niceties of service and appointments , those were matters alien to their experience . Such men were opportunists , pure and simple , with both eyes focussed on the present and no thought for the future ; which was natural , inasmuch as , so far as they knew , there might not be any future . They sold liquor without inquiring into its chemical constituents , on the theory that if its quality drove some customers away , there would always be others to take their places . That hundreds of them failed is scarcely cause for wonder . That many made money and are still making it , despite their methods , is merely one more proof that you can fool some of the people all the time . Yet though most of the speakeasies were started by ignorant ruffians , a few were opened by persons previously trained in the hotel , restaurant , or retail-liquor fields . Whether these were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York must sooner or later become a compromise , or whether they were only optimists , must remain a moot question . At any rate , they had vision enough to recognize that in the most sophisticated city in the country , where dining out was a deep-rooted habit , there would always be a demand for the liquor-serving restaurant . Owing to the chaotic enforcement situation , their beginnings were modest . The knowledge that their places might at any time be closed at the whim of a disgruntled patrolman or roving dry agent discouraged them from making heavy investments in decorations , furnishings , and equipment . But they shrewdly realized that cleanliness , appetizing foods suavely served , the best liquor obtainable , plus personal attention to the customer , would make up for the absence of luxury . Little by little , word-of-mouth advertising brought increased patronage and regular clienteles to these men who were restaurateurs first and criminals mainly by force of circumstances . Though sometimes they had to move , rather precipitously , they soon bobbed up again at new addresses , usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait long for their old customers to follow . Also , they recruited new ones . After a time , when it became obvious that wholesale arrests and padlockings were filling the local jails and court calendars to overflowing , without making a noticeable reduction in the number of speakeasies in operation , the State enforcement act was repealed . The police , whose hearts had never really been in it , were relieved from the necessity of taking the initiative in making raids and ordered back to work . The burden of obliterating the speakeasy fell on the Federal forces alone ? and proved too much for them . Joeand Henri , Louis and Giovanni , Tom , Bill , Tony , and George heaved sighs of relief and set to work to improve their places , or to re-establish them in new and worthier settings . They rented or bought fine houses , hired expensive decorators , set up elaborate bars , sent out engraved announcements to select lists . And the best people , who had once considered it infra dig to be seen in speakeasies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story which illustrates as well as any the status of the speakeasy in New York to-day . It concerns a Mrs. A , a member of one of the oldest families , born on Murray Hill and a tower of conservatism and dignity . For some time she had been hearing about speakeasies from her married daughters , who patronize them frequently , but she had never been to one herself . She had always thought of them as places to which it would be unseemly for persons of her age and background to go . But one day , quite recently , her curiosity got the better of her scruples . So , inviting three contemporaries to share the adventure , she directed her chauffeur to drive them to an address she had heard mentioned . The doorman surveyed the quartette with some misgivings , and , not knowing whether to admit them or not , summoned the proprietor . The latter , a former maitre d ' kaki of long experience , said that certainly he could vouch for the lady 's identity , and ushered her party in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would Madame and her friends care for a cocktail at the bar ? Of course , said Madame . So the four stood at the bar and bad their cocktails ? in the company of many other ladies ? and then an excellent lunch , cooked and served in a manner reminiscent of the old Delmonico 's . They were astonished and delighted . " But I had no idea , " said Mrs. A , " that speakeasies were like this . It is a charming place , charming . I shall come here very often . " A graph of the speakeasy day would show a business curve having four peaks , representing lunch , the cocktail hour , dinner , and the after-theater period . To give you a first-hand picture of the better-class establishments , I will take you to four of them , one at each different period . To finance this little junket it may be necessary for me to sell two or three bonds , but in the interests of social science one should be willing to make sacrifices . You see , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who , though they are liberal with their courtesy , have an understandable prejudice against giving away anything else . Catering to a section of the public which is prone to judge quality by price , they take no chances of alienating it by charging too little for their wares . And while they do , it is true , practice the old-time rite of providing occasional drinks " on the house , " they usually reserve it for the customer whose evening 's investment clearly entitles him to a dividend . I mention the sordid matter of money at the outset because , as Mr. Rockefeller , Sr. , used to say , plain understandings perpetuate friendships . Ou a hundred-odd dollars we shall be able to do ourselves fairly well . We may feel free to order whatever viands we wish from the menus submitted , without needing to consult the figures in the right-hand columns . We must be careful , however , not to absorb too many spirituous drinks , for at a dollar apiece , or even seventy-five cents , their cost mounts alarmingly fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restraint also . And it might as well be understood now , for the sake ofamity , that champagne , unless you agree to pay for it yourself , is out . There are in New York two kinds of speakeasies : those operated behind guarded doors and those which are open restaurants openly arrived at . Chez Recamier , whither we are headed for lunch , is among the latter . Here it is , on the ground floor of a great apartment house within a stone 's throw of Park Avenue . The liveried doorman under the entrance canopy will not inquire our names , for the question of our eligibility is none of his business . A simple doorman he , and nothing more , paid to open doors , call taxis , and keep the curb clear for arriving Lin-coins and Rolls-Royces . Now we are inside , in a little oblong foyer with mirrored walls and a plain taupe carpet . ( It should be explained , at this point , that for the purpose of this article you are a lady ? and supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to powder your nose , I surrender my hat and coat to the check boy , wash my hands , and repair to the lounge ; and there , just as I am finishing my cigarette , you rejoin me . It is an attractive spot , that lounge , with its pine panelling , its log fire , its softly yielding armchairs and couches , its vases of fresh flowers and its tables of current periodicals . But we are hungry and thirsty and we press on into the restaurant proper to be welcomed , at the doorway , by Rene himself , all bows and smiles . He shows us to a table ; we sit down , decide on dry Martinis , hors d'oeuvres , broiled sweetbreads , broccoli with hollandaise sauce , and a macedoine of fruit ; and then , while waiting , we take stock of our surroundings . We are seated side by side on an upholstered wall bench that extends around three sides of a. room roughly forty by sixty feet in area . The oblong tables ranging along the walls are just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , capable of seating upwards of six , stand within the rectangular floor space . On each table is a Lalique crystal vase of Talisman roses ; at each place gleaming silverware and glass and handsome service plates of modern design ; and the linen , needless to say , is immaculate . A thick carpet deadens the footsteps of waiters and busboys , who function with a quiet competence that bespeaks rigid training . But the character of the service is , after all , merely such as one has a right to expect of any first-class restaurant . And who could be better equipped to provide it than Rene , who began as a scullion in Switzerland and studied his profession in the most famous eating-places of Vienna , Berlin , Paris , and pre-prohibition New York ? Here is no beetle-browed monster , making war on Society , but a high priest of gastronomy who believes that alcohol and food were married in Heaven and that attempting to divorce them is a sin . In this he is sincere ; it is the chief reason why , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best hotels , he will have none of them . Of course , he makes a good deal of money where he is , and he is not fool enough to despise it utterly . Were pelf his first consideration , however , he could double his income by lowering his standards . He could promote the guzzling of liquor ? a practice he abhors ? but he does n't and he wo n't . His backers know this and make no attempt to coerce him . They own other , more profitable speakeasies , yet even they , who are anything but sentimentalists , derive satisfaction from knowing that their Chez Recamier is among the smartest places in town . Here come the Martinis . Rene 's method of serving them is an example of the art which conceals art . Nestling in bowls of crushed ice , they look for all the world like orders of sauerkraut juice , just as those Baccardis with grenadine , on the next table , look like well-seasoned essence of clams . Strangers do stray in , you see , and there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regular customers are partial to vitamins . You need n't fear , however , that because our Martinis outwardly resemble sauerkraut juice they will taste like that gruesome fluid , or that they will not exert the warming effect that they should . When I said that Recamier was among the smartest places in town , perhaps I ought to have been a little more explicit . Smartness , nowadays , is a relative term ; and Society an elastic one . It is possible to he smart without being in the Social Register and to be in the Social Register without being smart , in the present-day sense . These people lunching all about us are of mixed origins . They include members of old New York families ? not yet impoverished ? and persons whose parents may have come over in the steerage . But almost without exception they are men and women whose names , for one reason or another , are more or less familiar to the general newspaper-reading public . Directly opposite us , for example , is the head of a famous dressmaking house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right are two well-known young Park Avenue-Palm Bea ' h-Southampton matrons . On the left are a prominent manufacturer and a lady not his wife ; beyond them an eminent polo player with his fiancee . In the corner is the editor of a fashionable magazine , entertaining one of his most celebrated authors , here for a lecture tour . Next to them are two ornaments of the screen , recently arrived from a vacation in Paris . All in all , a typical cross-section of " smart " New York . At the other speakeasies on our schedule , you will doubtless see several of the same people again , for they move in a rather narrow orbit . This is the proper place to lunch , Jerry 's the place to dine ; after the theater they and their kind go to The Side Street . It is n't very exciting here ? No , it 's not supposed to be ; in fact , it 's supposed not to be . One does n't come for excitement , but for good food and drink served in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any music . Rene wo n't have it . He says if the music 's good enough to distract your attention from the food you are likely to get indigestion , and if it is n't you 're likely to get indigestion from having to listen to it . But what sort of excitement did you expect ? A shooting ? They do have shootings in some speakeasies , but not in the best ones ; at least , not as a general thing . The truth is that at the three other resorts on our list you will probably see not so much as a single mild brawl . Inasmuch as our fund ? now diminished by some fourteen dollars ? will not permit us to spend the whole afternoon eating and drinking , let 's go to a good movie , to pass the time until the cocktail hour . There is a theater on Broadway which confers a favor on mankind by almost always showing Mickey Mouse pictures , which are by far the most engaging films that have ever come out of Hollywood . For cocktails we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upwards of a thousand places called Tony 's , but there is only one that 's really select . There it is ? that large white stone house across the street , with the flower boxes and striped awnings , and the taxis and town cars all trying to crowd in front of the door at once . During the rush hours at Tony 's there 's usually a policeman stationed outside to keep the traffic under control and prevent parking too close to the entrance . New Yorkers have such a deplorable lack of respect for parking seen a one of Tony 's will interest you . It is a huge oval , occupying almost the entire front portion of the second floor space . Its polished black top , rimmed with stainless steel , rests on a base of contrasting natural woods . Little swivel stools , covered in beige leather , to match the color of the walls , are set all around it . In the center , the oval back-bar , also done in black and beige , is a sparkling pyramid of vari-colored bottles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy , shaking and mixing . We 're lucky to get seats . In a few minutes more the customers will be clustered here three deep . Do you hear that English voice ? Do n't look round now . That celebrated visiting author we saw at lunch just came in with his editor . When he saw this bar he tottered slightly with surprise and said " Strawdenry . " He 's still repeating it , but I think in a moment he may have recovered sufficiently to try a sentence . Do you notice the number of women ? And girls ? Whole platoons of women and girls , among the latter d ? butantes of this year , last year , and year after next . Camera fodder for the rotogravure sections , all of them . When I was a boy , girls of their upbringing were n't allowed to move a step without adventurous provocative . " But my dear fellah ? I mean to say ? I mean how long 's all this been going on ? , Most visitors to New York ask that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclamation of incredulity . So you 'd like another old-fashioned ? Well , perhaps they might be stronger , but do n't forget we have other pastures to browse in . We 're going to Jerry 's for dinner , and if people are n't reasonably sober when they arrive at Jerry 's the doorman wo n't let them in . That 's a fact . You may have one more old-fashioned now , since you 're pining for it , but after that you 'd better go to your hotel and take a nap and a cold shower . You see , we ca n't dine at Jerry 's in day clothes without being conspicuous , and even if we could , we 'd have to dress to get a table at The Side Street afterwards . Does it seem slightly ridiculous that wearing evening clothes should be mandatory at a speakeasy ? When you 're once inside Jerry 's you 'll think differently . I 'll call for you at half past seven . .. . Jerry 's house , just off the Avenue , is a chaste gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . There is a grille in this door through which one is inspected and , if need be , challenged . I have n't been here for some months , but the doorman will probably remember not only my face but my name . They have prodigious memories , those fellows . Do n't you think this hall 's rather attractive ? That 's a real Matisse over there . Jerry picked it up in Paris a couple of summers ago . He goes to Paris every year , to lay his pipes , so to speak . We 'll probably find him in the bar . It 's through that door at the rear . The bar at Jerry 's is invariably jammed , except in off hours , and the tables are so close that everybody sits in everybody else 's lap , more or less . But if we stand as close as we can , when someone leaves we can catch a bartender 's eye . What 'll you have ? Everything is genuine here ; not like the usual bootleg stuff at all . Jerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to know the difference between the real thing and the other kind . And he goes to a great deal of trouble to provide the best . That 's he over there , the lean chap talking to the pair at the end table . The girl is Marjorie Cipher ? you may have heard of her . She inherited a hundred million from her grandfather . The boy with her is Billy Dash . He 's only got fifty million of his own , but he 'll have more when his mother dies , so he 's managed to persuade Marjorie to say she 'll marry him . This is the place to see the people whom the fashion magazines call the best people . There 's the manufacturer who was at Recamier , still squiring the lady who is not his wife . Jerry is probably telling Billy he 's already had enough to drink . Customers do n't get drunk here if he and his partner can prevent it . After a certain point they either water their drinks or refuse to serve them any more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worse for wear are refused admittance , no matter who they may be . There are n't many speakeasy proprietors who take that attitude . But there 's nothing altruistic or moralistic about it ; simply sound business policy . Jerry knows that if the place were allowed to become disorderly the best people would stay away . Lots of rich men introduce their sons here , so that when the boys are down from school or college they wo n't need to worry about the possibility of their being poisoned or robbed . Another point in favor of this place is that you can pay by check , without being afraid of its being raised . For that matter , if your credit rating is satisfactory , you can run an account . A friend of mine had two checks raised in other speakeasies last winter . One for nine dollars was raised to ninety , and the other , for forty , was raised to four hundred . The bank detected them , so it was all right . Of course , there are other honest places in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quite good , and so is Louis ' , next door but one . In fact there arc excellent speakeasies dotted about in all these streets , though most of them just miss being first class . This is a big room , really , but it 's been decorated so as to look small . Notice how the walls are crowded with prints and gadgets , and how low the beamed ceiling seems , though it is n't ? It was all carefully thought out . You see , people do n't warm up in a place that feels too much like a cathedral . It does get a trifle smoky and noisy , but after we 've had another cocktail we 'll go upstairs for dinner . We can order it now . Let 's see . . some oysters to begin with ; a clear soup ; English sole Duglire ; a partridge en casserole ; an endive salad ; crepes Suzette for dessert , and then coffee . A bottle of Chablis with the sole ; Burgundy with the partridge ; Napoleon brandy with the coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every bit as good as the best you find in Paris . As a matter of fact it 's good in most of the better speakeasies . That 's why , in New York at any rate , the hotels are losing money on their restaurants . Speakeasies have run away with the cream of the dinner trade ; not only because they serve drinks , but because they serve more palatable food . The best of the foreign chefs prefer working in places like this to working in hotels . For one thing , cooking almost everything to order , for immediate consumption , gives them an incentive to do their best . In the second place , they have the choicest materials to work with and the wines their recipes call for . Third , they and their kitchen staffs are paid more than the hotels , struggling against high overhead costs , can possibly afford . Now that the crowd in the bar is thinning out , we might as well go upstairs too . The dining rooms are never congested , even when filled , because all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floors clear for action . To me the Chinese red leather upholstery of the benches and wainscoting seems too vivid and to clash with the evening gowns , but Jerry says it 's good because it looks gay when you come in and that most of it is concealed anyway when the tables are occupied . Above the wainscoting the walls are of painted plaster , creamy buff in hue and unadorned . The win ' dow curtains of black velvet and the black ceiling beams make quite a striking effect . Ah , here come the oysters . . . . I hope you enjoyed the dinner as much as I did . Considering that it NEW YORK was prepared and served by the outlaw employees of a pair of outlaws , it seems to me to have been a not uncivilized production . The barbaric feature was the fact that prohibition , which is supposed to make it impossible , and protection money , which made it possible , combined to make it three times as expensive as it should have been . I do not , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enjoy herself , but this is a special case . We have been so far to three places , in each of which we have been rather abstemious , yet my hundred-dollar fund has considerably diminished . Lunch , as I think I already mentioned , cost $14 . Cocktails at Tony 's amounted , with tips , to $11.50 . Cocktails downstairs added another $6.50 to the score . The dinner check , including the wine and the brandy , plus tips , came to $44.35 . So that by the time I 've tipped the hat boy we shall have managed to dispose of $70 since noon . As some people spend money , that is nothing at all ; a little dinner for four costing over $100 is by no means unusual , even during the depression . It 's enough , however , to give you an idea of the income one needs in order to patronize speakeasies of this kind regularly ; and to explain how it is possible for some of them to do a gross business of $2,000 to $3,000 daily . Iv @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too late for the theaters and , as it 's too early for The Side Street , we might as well sit here and talk . You have been charmingly restrained in the matter of asking questions , but I imagine you have one or two in mind which I may be able to divine . You are probably wondering , for instance , why some of these places maintain an air of secrecy , whereas others , such as Chez Recamier , operate openly . That does seem to require explanation , because it must be obvious that anyone who took the trouble to watch this house , for example , could scarcely mistake it for anything but what it is . Granted that large private families do consume foodstuffs in abundance , few , if any , have need for the quantities of provisions that are delivered here daily . Granted , too , that some families entertain on a large scale , few , if any , have guests by the hundred , four times a day . Nor is it customary at the best houses to subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door to them . Indeed , by that one sign alone , even the feeblest intellect should be able to distinguish between a speakeasy and a private residence . This being so , is there really anything to be gained by keeping up so shallow a pretense ? Yes , there is . Prohibition agents must have actual evidence of law violation in order to make a case . Suspicion , or even moral certainty , is not evidence . To obtain that , the agent must gain entry to the premises by subterfuge or by warrant . If he displays a warrant to the man on the door , thereby giving the alarm , ten to one the evidence will be destroyed ? and his quarry flown ? before he and his men can break in . If he does not display a warrant , and can not identify himself to the satisfaction of the doorman , he ca n't get in at all . As things are arranged nowadays , I 'm told , it is not often that agents try to gain admittance to respectable speakeasies with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make themselves unpopular . Agents are largely occupied in harassing the dive keepers and other small-fry , and in tracking down stills , breweries , and rum-runners . But , at times , special agents are sent from Washington , or from other territories , with instructions to stir things up . And , at times , it happens that such envoys are dry and incorruptible . Proprietors of speakeasies where drinks are sold over the bar and served undisguised at the tables have a natural aversion to letting unknown agents stroll in at random . For , in the jargon of the trade , these persons may be " wrong guys " ? a self-explanatory term . Refusing admittance to strangers also keeps out non-official wrong guys . It does a high-class speakeasy no good to allow its clientele to become mixed . Then too , there are the hijacker , the hold-up man , and other undesirables to be guarded against . If Jerry 's customers could not feel safe wearing their pearls and sables in his establishment they would soon cease to patronize it . Hence the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indelible memory , and the sixth sense which enables him to differentiate between wrong guys and right . But what of the resorts into which anyone can walk without preliminary identification ? Do n't they run the same risks ? They do , and yet their very openness serves in a measure to protect them . Jerry 's is but one house in a street of similar houses , fully half of which are speakeasies of varying grades . There is nothing about the exterior of Jerry 's to indicate that it is different from a cheap table d'hAte speakeasy two doors away . But the external appearance of a place such as Chez Recamier , for example , together with its location in an expensive apartment house in an expensive part of town , automatically keeps away the cheaper class of patronage . The impressive doorman under the smart canopy and the French name on a little brass plaque beside the door show at once the quality of the place . The very fact that it is not disguised tends to disarm suspicion , for there is nothing in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an oasis . It would be rash to state that any social gathering place in the United States ? except the White House , perhaps ? is bandit-proof . In a restaurant so plain to view as the Recamier , however , one can feel at least as safe from predatory visitors as in a hotel dining room or a bank . Toward the danger from unexpected prohibition wolves in sheep 's clothing , Rene and his colleagues maintain an attitude of cheerful cynicism . " When an agent comes , " explains Rene , " we have a little conference . We go into what you call a huddle , yes ? We tell him we do a nice , clean business here and that our patrons are of the first rank . And we ask him what is to do . Alm , monsieur , an agent is human , is it not ? He does not want to make trouble , but he does not want to lose the job . He has got to show the boss a prisoner once in a while . So he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back three grand and a couple of waiters . ' But us , we are not too ignorant , you know . So we say we give him two grand and a couple of waiters . Et voila ! " The waiters are charged with " possession " and let off with fines which the syndicate pays . Meanwhile business hums along as before . It must not be concluded from this that all prohibition agents are venal , or that no New York speakeasies are ever dealt with according to law . That would be untrue . In the district which includes Manhattan ? and extends over several counties to the north-3,227 speakeasies were raided in 1931 . Enforcement is being carried on . But the fact that many establishments have been in continuous operation for three , five , and even eight years tends to justify the assertion that it is enforcement of a selective brand . A few days ago a reporter friend of mine witnessed the raiding of one of the most elaborate speakeasies he had ever seen . In addition to dining rooms and bars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my friend estimated , the place must have represented an investment of not less than $200,000 . " Why do you suppose it was raided ? " I asked him . " I do n't have to suppose , " he replied , " I know . When the place was new it did n't do much business , and to begin with it was assessed on that basis . I mean it did n't have to pay much for protection . Well , after a while it began to take in money by the barrel , and its assessment was raised in proportion . But the fellows running it refused to come across with the higher assessment , so they got closed up . That 's all there was to that . It was one time when being thrifty was n't so smart . " Externally , The Side Street resembles Tony 's , except that it is larger . Internally the arrangement is quite different . From the foyer a double door opens into a huge , lofty dining room , brilliantly decorated in scarlet and black . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far end of this room . At the other end are stairs leading to a balcony , off which is a bar for men only . Triple rows of tables form a hollow square surrounding the dance floor . In one corner is an orchestra . As we enter , one of the musicians , seated at a miniature piano , close to a table of twenty , is singing for the special delectation of the guest of honor ? who looks as if he were still muttering " Strawdenry . " There are several other long tables ; one , not yet occupied , is set for fifty and is a mass of orchids . On all sides are coolers for champagne . Let 's get a table nearby .
