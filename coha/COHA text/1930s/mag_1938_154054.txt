In 1842 , the little Austrian Tyrolean town of Salzburg started the summer music festivals in honor of its illustrious son , Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart . These festivals were attended by the good , pipe-smoking Brger of Salzburg , by a few hardy music-lovers from nearby Vienna and Munich , by an occasional tourist or student from the great world beyond the Alps . Their programs were simple and unimportant . In 1918. however , a group of Viennese musicians , headed by Composer Richard Strauss , Conductor Franz Schalk , Stage Director Max Reinhardt and Playwright Hugo von Hofmannsthal . decided to give Salzburg a bigger place on the musical map . Two years later the first big Salzburg Festival was given , with a gala outdoor performance of von Hofmannsthal 's Jedermann ( Everyman ) as its principal drawing card . <P> In 1934 , when famed Maestro Arturo Toscanini snubbed Germany 's Bayreuth Festival and decided to conduct in Salzburg instead , Salzburg 's annual festival became Europe 's biggest single tourist attraction . To it flocked not only music-lovers from all the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , swank socialites . <P> Last spring , Austria 's Nazification left the future of the Salzburg Festival in doubt . Maestro Toscanini , implacable foe of Naziism , immediately announced his resignation . Nazi racial policies ruled out Salzburg 's two remaining luminaries . Conductor Bruno Walter and Stage Director Reinhardt . Though Nazi authorities soon announced that the festival would be continued as usual , it was obvious that Salzburg , 1938 model , was going to be very different from the Salzburgs that had preceded it . <P> Last week , as the first Nazi-sponsored Salzburg Festival opened , the extent of this difference became apparent . Cancellation of bookings from outside Greater Germany ( including nearly 50% of those from England and the U. S. ) converted the festival from an international tourist event into a dominantly German celebration . Places of absent foreign visitors were taken by droves of enthusiastic Nazis , including hundreds of members of Propaganda Minister Goebbels ' " Strength through Joy " movement who had been granted specially reduced rates . The elaborate permanent stages formerly used for the Reinhardt Faust and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name plates marking " Reinhardt Platz " and " Toscanini Hof " had been removed . <P> The festival 's general program had changed little , but the personnel had changed much . In the place of the absent Toscanini reigned Germany 's No. 1 conductor , Wilhelm Furtwngler . Notably absent from the roster were such famous operatic names as Lotte Lehmann , Kerstin Thorborg , Rosa Pauly . In place of the grandiose stage productions of Faust and Jedermann , two new dramatic productions were scheduled : Goethe 's Egmont and Amphitryon , a play by Germany 's 19th-Century , romantic Playwright Bernd Heinrich Wilhelm von Kleist .
