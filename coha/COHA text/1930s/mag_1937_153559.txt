Dr. Harvey Harlow Nininger has made Denver the meteorite capital of the U. S. Curator of meteorites at Colorado Museum of Natural History , professor of geology and meteoritics at University of Denver , he is the most persistent and energetic chaser of meteorites in the land , possessor of the world 's largest private meteorite collection and probably the only scientist anywhere who spends all his working time hunting , studying , writing or talking about fragments of the cosmos from outer space . Last week some 800 members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science assembled in Denver for their summer meeting , and one of the sectional conferences was that of the Society for Research on Meteorites , of which Dr. Nininger is secretary . He had been waiting for this occasion and he was much in evidence-slim , dark , bespectacled , lecturing in a deep , pleasant voice , pointing a bamboo fishing pole at his lantern slides . He gave three talks , introduced two of the other speakers . <P> Most meteors or " shooting stars " are entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the atmosphere . Meteorites are bodies which are big enough to survive their flaming passage and land on earth . Meteoriticist Nininger was born 50 years ago in Kansas , in which a greater number of important meteorite finds have been made than in any other U. S. State . He started his scientific career , however , as a biologist . One night in 1923 , while he was a biology professor at McPherson College in Kansas , he saw a shooting star so bright that he was sure some of it must have reached earth . The idea so excited him that he chucked biology for star-chasing forthwith . <P> Meteorites fall in showers and Harvey Nininger by last week had got his hands on specimens from 77 different meteoritic falls . He pays what he considers a fair price to landowners on whose property meteorites are discovered , whether they are aware or not of the scientific value of the prize . His usual price is $1 per Ib. , but he may pay much more than that for unusually fine specimens . He has supplied meteorites to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Museum , Manhattan 's American Museum , museums in Mexico , England , France , Czechoslovakia . <P> One of Dr. Nininger 's troubles is that most people who see a brilliant fireball are so excited that their subsequent testimony Is likely to be highly inaccurate . He himself has learned to sight meteor paths with extraordinary precision . On one occasion he sighted a fireball , marked out its probable course by drawing a line on a map . This line passed through the very field in which the meteorite , a splendid 820-pounder , was located a month later . <P> Last week Dr. Nininger learnedly described operations on a meteoritic site in Kiowa County . Kansas , which he believes to be the world 's first complete excavation of a meteorite crater . Some 300,000 separate fragments were recovered there , ranging from 85 Ib. down to tiny grains . Assistant Secretary of the Society for Research on Meteorites is Dr. Nininger 's wife , Addie Delp Nininger.
