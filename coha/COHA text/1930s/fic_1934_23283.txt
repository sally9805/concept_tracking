THE COUNTRY SUIT A STORY BY GRIFFITH BEEMS " G OD HEAVENS , " Zoe said aloud , " why do we do these things ? " For ten minutes , although he had not stirred , she had known from his breathing that Steve was awake . Turning in her own section of the studio couch , she slipped her forearm beneath her cheek , drew up her knees , and regarded the back of Steve 's head in the adjacent section contentedly . In turning , by straining her eyeballs upward , she had glimpsed the face of the alarm clock , ticking harshly on the table with the groceries . The white northern light edged the fully drawn blind in the one window , glittered starlike in the chinks and came through , yellowing the blind and shadowing the narrow hall-like apartment . The window behind the blind was open , and Zoe felt the cool damp April air on her naked arms . Her husband flounced completely over and slowly , lazily , smiled at her . " What things ? " he mocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections were in the bed between them . Through his tousled hair he looked half his age , which was twenty-four . " It 's disgracefully late , " Zoe said . " It 's after twelve thirty . Get up , Stevie , and let some light in . " " You must permit me the luxury of disobedience this bright Sunday morning . " " I do n't permit you the luxury of disobedience any morning . And do n't yawn in my face . You look like the mandrill at the zoo . I never saw such a big mouth . " " Pray God you never see bigger , " Steve said , forcing his jaws into an even greater yawn , " close up . " " Now do get up and no nonsense . " " I 'm tired . " " If you are n't the laziest , most impudent little devil . " " Smart too , " Steve grinned . " What 's the rush to-day anyway , sweetie pie ? " " I want to get up and wear my new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice and laughed at her own intonation . " I ca n't wait to wear it into the office to-morrow , " she added . Steve hooted . " Office , " he said disdainfully . " Office . Never mind about the office . This suit is something else again . And never mind about tomorrow . Where can we go to-day ? Where 's a place we can go to-day , Zoe , and show off the wife of Mr. Stephen Denham in her new suit to the world at large ? That 's what I want to do . Where shall we go ? " " How should I know , silly ? " " There must be a place where you can go to make an effect , even on Sunday . You must know , Zoe . A woman should know . " " There 's church . " " I do n't mean church . " " It 's too late for a church , " Zoe said . " Besides , you do n't show off a suit like this . This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you show off ? " " Evening gowns . " " Do you want an evening gown , sweetie pie ? " " No , " Zoe said with alarm . " Do n't you think of it . You had no business getting me this . It 's an extravagance . " " We 've been married five months . It was high time . " " Humph . What has that to do with it ? " " Everything . When I walked by Tatham 's Wednesday and saw it in the window  --  chic , petite , irresistible  --  I had to buy it . It reminded me of you immediately . It must have been the form . I 'm sure it was the form . It was built exactly as you are . " Zoe covered her face with her hand in affected modesty . " Hey , wake up , " Steve said . " I 'm referring to your well-known figure . The form was built exactly as you are , rather trim and generally flat , with that saucy little lift , front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A lot you know about it . " " And the moment I saw this beautiful headless plasterwork figure , I thought to myself  --  Zoe  --  the spitting image of Zoe . Then when I saw Tatham 's advertisement in Friday morning 's paper devoted to this identical suit , lauding and praising it as ' The Classic Country Suit , ' with words like ' exclusive ' and ' dear England , ' that settled it . I could no longer resist . Particularly as it was mostly your money . We had to buy it . " " We did n't have to buy it . And we should n't have either . It went against my better judgment . Imagine people like us buying clothes at Tatham 's . Sixty dollars . It 's ridiculous . " " What 's ridiculous ? " " I 'm worried about it too . " " Why ? " " It 's so extreme . I 'm afraid . " " Of what ? " " Where can I wear it ? There 's a right and a wrong to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that 's what it 's called , how can I wear it to the office ? " " Wear it anywhere . " " A lot you know about it . " " Nonsense . The suit is all right . I know what I 'm talking about , Zoe . The real people come to a department store . Do n't look superior , because I know what I 'm talking about . I see them every day . I see just as many well dressed people in the drapery section as you can see anywhere else in this city . I know what I 'm talking about , and the suit is the real thing . I like it . It 's what they call classic tailleur . Anyway  --  listen , let me tell you something . Once when I was young another kid told me about his girl . He told his girl he did n't like the color of her stockings and she went straight home and changed them . " Zoe laughed . " It made quite an impression on me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't change my stockings for any man alive . It 's too foolish . " Steve looked at her , and his neck against the white pajama collar flushed . " You do n't get the point , " he said . " What point ? " " If you seem like a knockout to me what more do you want ? " " Nothing , " Zoe said . " Nothing . " She reached her hand toward him . " Do n't be mad at me , darling . You know , do n't you ? " " I 'm not mad , " Steve asserted , ignoring her hand , and sitting up with his face turned from her . " You surprise me sometimes , that 's all . " He got into his blue slippers and went into the bathroom . Zoe , her arm still under her cheek , watched him go . He did not look back . He needs breakfast , she thought . The room was disordered . Their clothes were flung together in the overstuffed armchair . By the head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette stubs and beside it a heap of orange peel . Zoe slipped into Steve 's half of the couch . It was still warm . She lay for a moment in his warmth . Near the alarm clock , ticking harshly on the table , were the breakfast groceries in paper sacks as Steve had dropped them the preceding evening when they came in . It had been nine o'clock then and Saturday . Zoe sighed and sat up shivering . The suit was of brown herringbone . It had a single-breasted short jacket with pockets and mannish lapels and a straight fitted skirt . After breakfast Zoe dressed carefully . She put on a white piqu ? blouse with the suit and walked up and down the room , buttoning and unbuttoning the jacket . She got out her last summer 's brown straw sailor and tied Steve 's green and yellow plaid muffler , ascot fashion , around her neck , tucking the ends inside the jacket . She stroked the tweed along her thighs and bit her upper lip reflectively . Steve lifted down the mirror from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " You 're a knockout . " " The skirt and jacket seem to be even , " Zoe admitted . " Lower it a little . " " It looks on you just as I knew it would when I first saw it in the window . You 're a knockout , Zoe . I marvel you 're not jumping up and down with delight . I warn you that 's what I expect . " " I am , Stevie  --  inside . There , you can raise it . I ca n't sec it across the back . Does it hike up at the neck ? I guess not . How is it across the fanny ? Has it got that slack look these English things always have on slender women ? " " Not a bit . You fill it out perfectly . " " What do you mean ? You mean ? " " Nothing of the kind , " Steve said . " I was exaggerating . You 're perfect . " " But is n't it  --  is n't it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as they can see you that you 're a woman , very female , all wool and a yard wide . " " Never mind that crack about a yard wide , " Zoe said . " I feel horribly man-nish . " " You look horribly smart . " " It 's so extreme . " She stood with her feet apart , her fingers thrust into the slanted hip pockets of her skirt , and in the mirror she practiced with arms and shoulders the attitudes between raffish and akimbo . " I ca n't make up my mind , " she said , throwing herself into the overstuffed chair . She studied the skirt while she crossed and recrossed her knees several times . " I do n't believe this is a real country suit  --  the kind that English . women wear with brogans , tramping round in rain and fog through the countryside . It 's too well tailored . It pinches in at the waist . It 's more of a tailored business suit . " " That 's right , " Steve said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-dressed way . You 'll see . It will never go out of fashion . That 's the way you should always dress , Zoe . These inexpensive things you get are all styled to beat the band . They look superannuated in about two months and you have to throw them away . Now if you ? " " Oh , hush , " Zoe said . " Are you off on that again ? I 'm glad to throw them away in two months . I 'm tired of them by then . I ca n't afford good clothes . We should n't have done this . When I think . Sixty dollars . It 's too extravagant . " " You are n't really pleased with it , are you , Zoe ? " " Yes , I am . " " It was made for you . Do n't be disappointed . I wish you 'd believe me . You 're stunning . I 'm going to have to dress up before I can even tag along . " He hung the mirror again on the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dash if you 're going to wear my plaid muffler . " " I am , " Zoe stated , " and let 's hear no more about that . You can buy another muffler , but do n't get a plaid one . We 'd look funny together . " " And that shall never be . " " Are you sure I look all right ? " " Positive . You look like a girl straight out of a limousine . " " But I 'm not out of a limousine . Oh , dear , I ca n't be sure . I 've never had anything so extreme . " " Stop worrying . This suit will loosen folks ' teeth with envy . You 're a knockout . I 'll stand on my head if that will make it any more emphatic . " " All right , " Zoe said . " Let 's see what happens to me in the street . If anybody laughs at it I 'll die . " " They wo n't , " Steve said . " It says class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods . " " I suppose so , " Zoe said . They got off the subway at Times Square and walked the two long blocks across town to Fifth Avenue . At the corner they turned northward up the avenue . Shadows from the office buildings darkened the street . The clock in front of the Guaranty Trust Company said twenty minutes to three . It was a gray afternoon . The avenue , its contours perceptible through the thin Sunday traffic , dipped and then surmounted a slight rise at 50th Street . The buildings were deserted ; along the street level in many of the shop fronts the curtains had been drawn . In those others , in the open windows and the gray light , the lame , the satin , the rhinestones , and the marcasite did not glitter ; alI was cold and expensive . Green buses , their upper decks half filled , careered by , discharging carbon monoxide . " He noticed , " Steve said . " Humph , " Zoe said . " I ca n't be bothered . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was you or the suit , but he certainly gave you a tumble . " " Do n't bother about the men , " Zoe said . " What do they know about it ? Look at the women . " " Men have better taste than women . " " Yes , yes , of course , darling . You have marvelous taste . But let 's not argue . Just watch . " " I 'd be fighting mad the way men look at you if I did n't know you were crazy about me . " " Stop fishing , Stevie . I 'm not going to say a word to you until I make up my mind about this suit . " " Come on . Just one crumb . " " Not a smidgen . Just watch now and do n't talk . " " That one looked you over , all right , " Steve said . " Did you see her eyes ? They started with your hat and went right down to your shoes and back up and down and hack and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked back at you . " " Yes , and caught you looking at her over your shoulder . Now please do n't do that again . Do n't look back . Especially at a woman like that . I do n't care a rap about her opinion . Her coat was at least four years old . Did n't you notice ? Monkey fur . Did n't it look silly ? " " It always reminds me of a bear claw necklace the way it spreads out around the neck . " " Yes , that 's right , " Zoe said , pressing his arm . " I never did like it much . I must get myself a pair of shoes though . These are n't right . I ought to have some brown oxfords , short vamps you know , with grosgrain ties to do in a nice bow . You know the kind . It 's a trifle early for this hat too . Look . You sec that couple over there in front of the jeweler 's window ? Do n't stare . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say . When I go up to the window , you follow behind me , be sure and stay a little behind , and while I 'm looking in the window , you keep your eye on the woman . Understand ? " " She noticed you , " Steve said . " She looked you over but I could n't tell . The glasses hid her eyes and she had a face like a stone wall anyway . Not a trace of expression . She was old too , fifty if she was a day , and her complexion looked like raw fishmeat . She 'd had her face lifted , did you notice ? And an odd thing happened . The man was standing there , between you and her , and a little behind both of you , and I 'm sure I saw his fingers move . I just had a sense of motion out of the corner of my eye . His arm hung down very near you and his fingers curled up a little , a very little , in his glove . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Zoe said . " It is n't nice to notice those things . The reason I took you over there was because they both looked as though they 'd know good clothes when they saw them . She was wearing a mink coat that cost two thousand if it cost a penny . There was that iron burglar thing over the window but I could see a little in the reflection . I think she was im-pressed . " " I know she was . " " I feel better . " " I do n't like that woman . Why is it that old hulks like her always have ? " " Shush , " Zoe said . " It is n't nice to talk that way . I do n't want her mink coat . What do we care ? Look . Over there . The couple in front of the window . Is n't it sweet the way she 's hanging onto him ? That 's the way we are . " " Yes , " Steve said , " just look . She 's hanging onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fidgeting on one foot , just itch-ing for that awful pink negligee with the marabou feathers , while he stands there like a poor sap , saying ' Yes , honey , when our ship comes in , ' or some other tripe . " " Now , now , " Zoe said . They walked arm in arm . The avenue was not crowded and they sauntered , part of the straggling northward-going column , watching the countermoving successions of faces . The passers-by stared at one another , breathed in the air of the avenue , and stopped before the theatrically set shop windows with the sober manners of people getting through an idle afternoon . An old flower woman held out refrigerator-freshened violets from a pasteboard box with the suppliance of a beggar . Pushing boys , walking four abreast , crowded by on the way to Central Park . In the bleak light the windshields and nickel plating on the traffic competing in the avenue glinted dully . Zoe and Steve looked in each of Tatham 's windows ; Steve pointed out the gilded fleche on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complained about the life of stockings and the off-the-face trend in hats , when suddenly , near St. Thomas ' Church , sharply Zoe squeezed Steve 's arm . Approaching them from the opposite direction came a tall young woman in a similar suit . The suit was gray . She was alone and walked heavily on her heels , leading a black toy porneranian by a black leash . She wore a black felt slouch hat with an aluminum buckle and around her shoulders , slung magnificently , two deep-pelt silver fox furs . She stopped just before they passed , ostensibly to allow the dog on his brisk soldierly legs to catch up , and stared at Zoe . " Not quite the same , " Zoe said . " I like brown better . Her tweed was too salt and peppery looking and her hips are so large the skirt had to be shaped . Custom tailored probably . But such furs . " " Never mind , Zoe . At least you 're an honest woman . " " Humph . Is n't that a man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you notice ? The suits arc really the same . " He spoke triumphantly . " Yours is the real thing , Zoe . Did n't you notice ? Does n't she convince you ? " " Yes , a little , " Zoe admitted . " I guess maybe you 're right , all right . " " Really satisfied ? " " Yes . " " Hurray , " Steve whispered boisterously . " Hurray . Listen , Zoe . Can I do the bells ? I want to do the bells . " " You can not , " Zoe said firmly . " You keep your feet right on the ground and match along now . " The next morning Zoe passed the switchboard , walked down the office corridor , turned right , and deliberately entered the stenographic room of Standard Credit , Inc. , seven minutes late . Eleven girls behind typewriter tables , in their various ways with forms , carbons , lipsticks , letters , handkerchiefs , statements , and mirrors , were preparing to begin a day 's work . " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hack while she placed her hat on the locker shelf and smoothed at her hair . There were greetings and a rising storm . " Zoe Denham , you 've got on a new suit . " Zoe recognized Marjorie Fink 's voice and turned round . " Oh , is n't it smart ? . . . Is n't it darling ? . . . I 've never seen anything like it . . . . Is n't it cute ? . . Where did you get it ? . . Swank , I 'll say . . . . Turn round ... turn round ... . Absolutely darling . . . . What you must have paid for it . . . . It 1.4. s like a dream . . . . You lucky thing . . . . Unbutton it . . . . Let 's see . . . . Look how beautifully it 's finished . . . . See this hem . . . . Hand-whipped . . . . Button it all the way down . . . . Just feel it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both buttons now . . . . I ca n't get over the way it fits . . . . Is n't it English , though ? . . Tell us where you found it . . . . It 's her type , is n't it , girls ? . . You look positively striking in it . . . It 's too darling for words . . . Oh , Zoe . . . " " Tatham 's , " Zoe said . By the time Mr. Albee rang Zoe was glad to get away . But she could hardly wait for lunch . She met Marjorie Fink by prearrangement and they rode together in the elevator in a bursting silence . No sooner had they pushed through the revolving door into the street than Zoe exclaimed : " What did they say ? Tell me. quick . " " They all liked it , " Marge said . " They really did . " " I thought so . " Zoe breathed relievedly . " Tell me everything . " Over their sandwiches and coffee Marge told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to try wearing pastel-colored blouses with it ? pale blue or chartreuse , she said  --  and Wahnetah agreed with her . She said that with such conservative style , anything frivolous , a jabot , a ruche , frills , you know , would look just right . She said it was such a chance to look adorably feminine . " " What did Nosey have to say ? " " Would n't you just know ? She said no one could go wrong at Tatham 's . It was getting bargains that took taste . " " Is n't that her ? " " Is n't it though ? " " It 's about time we opened the window again . We have n't given Nosey a good draft for a long time , have we ? " " No , " Marge said , " but do n't mind her . What do you think ? I have n't told you the most exciting thing yet . " " What is it ? " " What do you think Miss Hawkins said ? " " What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ napkin floated under the table . " Did Hawkins notice it ? " " She certainly did . Kitty said  --  you know they 're thick right now  --  that Hawkins told her that she thought if you had half of Bella Orton 's salary as a secretary to do it on , you 'd outdress her easily . " " Did Hawkins say that ? No . Really , Marge ? " " She certainly did . Now that is something , Zoe . " " Do n't I know it ? " Zoe said . " Do n't I kn , , w it ? Imagine . Did Kitty tell the other girls ? " " Everyone was there but Paula . " " Oh , Marge . I ca n't tell you . It 's wonderful . " " It certainly is . " " I 'll never get over this . I never will . And I 'll tell you a secret , Marge . You must n't breathe it , but when I walked into that office this morning I was shaking in my shoes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit out , you know . Steve did . He saw it in Tatham 's window and he made me go there and buy it . He went with me . I did n't want to . I would n't ever have thought of getting it myself , I never wore anything like it before . And I tell you , I was scared . I was scared stiff . I knew it was a wonderful suit , but I did n't know whether I could carry it off . If anybody had wisecracked about it this morning , I think I'd. have torn their eyes out . You do n't know how I felt . " " You did n't show it . " " If I could n't put this suit across  --  I do n't know what might n't have happened . You do n't know Steve , Marge . You 've met him , but you do n't know him . You never knew anyone like him . He expects so much it scares me . He expects me to wear everything , doeverything , know everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't , I ca n't , but I do n't dare . He 's  --  he'syou do n't know ? " " AlI right , " Marge conceded . " All right . We 're all of us entitled to be goofy over one of them once . " " I think I 'll call him up and tell him . " " Now ? " " Of course not , " Zoe said . " Do n't be silly , Why waste nickels ? Standard Credit 's telephones are good enough for me . But I 'm going to . And what a load off my mind . " By three o'clock Mr. Albee had gone out , and she telephoned from his room . " Steve , oh , Steve , how are you , darling ? Are you free ? No customers ? . . . I could n't wait to tell you . Are you all right ? . . . What do you think happened ? The office is just crazy about my suit . They really are . I never had such a success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more wonderful still . . . . Miss Hawkins told Kitty Fay that I was the best dressed girl in the office . Think of that . Are n't you proud ? . . . Really , you know , it 's all you . I ca n't thank you enough , Steve , for getting me the suit . . . I 'm so happy . I ca n't thank you enough . Be home as soon as you can . I want to eat you up . You 're so wonderful . Oh , Stevie . . . " Steve listened , answering very little . This was the response he had anticipated , the response for which he had waited , a response overflowing , jubilant , reckless of praise , but for him Zoe 's enthusiasm came late . He recognized in his wife 's voice the delight that yesterday he had longed for and he recognized it with cold slow deepening chill . Putting the telephone back on the bundle desk , he walked to his section , his salesbook under his arm , swallowing down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensible . After all , it was only natural that the excited impression which the suit had made in the office should please Zoe . And Miss Hawkins  --  he was being petty if Miss Hawkins ' approval of his wife 's clothes made any difference to him . As though be could be jealous of Miss Hawkins . He had never even met the woman  --  somebody or other 's secretary . His feeling was jealousy , he told himself , petty jealousy , and he ought to give it no attention . He had no right to be disappointed in Zoe . It was not her fault . It was all very natural , and he was being unreasonable . He admitted he was being unreasonable and yet at the same time , if she loved me , he thought . . if she truly loved me . . . if I were everything to her . . . if I were the very center of her life . . Something within him , unreasoning and strong , was smarting like thawing frostbitten flesh .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
