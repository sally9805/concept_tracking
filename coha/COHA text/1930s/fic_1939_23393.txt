THE PRESBYTERIAN CHOIR SINGERS A STORY BY WILLIAM SAROYAN O NE of the many curious and delight- ful things about our country is the ease with which our good people move from one religion to another , or from no particular religion at all to any religion that happens to come along , without experiencing any particular loss or gain , and go right on being innocent anyhow . Myself , I was born , for instance , a kind of Catholic , although I was not baptized until I was thirteen , a circumstance which , I remember clearly , irritated the priest very much and impelled him to ask my people if they were crazy , to which my people replied , We have been away . Thirteen years old and not baptized ! the priest shouted . What kind of people are you ? For the most part , my uncle Melik replied , we are an agricultural people although we have had our brilliant men too . It was a Saturday afternoon . The whole thing took no more than seven minutes , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel any change . Well , my grandmother said , you are now baptized . Do you feel any better ? For some months , I believe I ought to explain , I had been feeling intelligent , which led my grandmother to suspect that I was ill with some mysterious illness or that I was losing my mind . I think I feel the same , I said . Do you believe now ? she shouted . Or do you still have doubts ? I can easily say I believe , I said , but to tell you the truth I do n't know for sure . I want to be a Christian of course . Well , just believe then , my grandmother said , and go about your business . My business was in some ways quaint and in other ways incredible . I sang in the Boys Choir at the Presbyterian Church on Tulare Street . For doing so I received one dollar a week from an elderly Christian lady named Balaifal who lived in sorrow and solitude in the small ivy-covered house next to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , like myself , was loud in speech . That is to say , we swore a good deal  --  in all innocence of course  --  and by doing so grieved Miss or Mrs. Balaifal so much that she sought to save us while there was still time . To be saved was a thing I for one had no occasion to resent . Miss Balaifal ( 1 shall call her that from now on , since while I knew her she was certainly single , and since I do not know for sure if she ever married , or for that matter if she ever thought of marrying , or if she ever so much as fell in love ? earlier in life of course , and no doubt with a scoundrel who took the whole matter with a grain of salt ) ? Miss Balaifal , as I began to say , was a cultured woman , a reader of the poems of Robert Browning and other poets and a woman of great sensitivity , so that coming out on the porch of her house to hear us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when the limit had been reached , cried out , Boys , boys . You must not use profane language . Pandro Kolkhozian , on the one hand , seemed to be the most uncouth boy in the world and on the other  --  and this was the quality in him which endeared him to me  --  the most courteous and thoughtful . Yes , Miss Balaifum , he said . Balaifal , the lady corrected him . Please come here . Both of you . We went to Miss Balaifal and asked what she wanted . What do you want , Miss Balaifum ? Pandro said . Miss Balaifal went into her coat pocket and brought out a sheaf of pamphlets , and without looking at them handed one to each of us . My pamphlet was entitled , Redemption , The Story of a Drunkard . Pandro 's was entitled , Peace at Last , The Story of a Drunkard . What 's this for ? Pandro said . I want you boys to read those pamphlets and try to be good , Miss Balaifal said . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say anything here about profane language , Pandro said . There 's a good lesson for each of you in those pamphlets , the lady said . Read them and do n't use profane language any more . Yes , ma'am , I said . Is that all ? One thing more , Miss Balaifal said . I wonder if you boys would help me move the organ from the dining room to the parlor ? Sure , Miss Balaifum , Pandro said . Any time . So we went into the lady 's house and , while she instructed us in just how to do it without damaging the instrument or ourselves , we moved it , by slow degrees , from the dining room to the parlor . Now read those pamphlets , Miss Balaifal said . Yes , ma'am , Pandro said . Is that all ? Well , now , the lady said . I want you to sing while I play the organ . I ca n't sing , Miss Balaifum , Pandro said . Nonsense , the lady said . Of course you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Pedro is my cousin 's name . As a matter of fact Pandro 's name was Pantalo , which in Armenian means pants . When he had started to school his teacher had n't cared for , or had n't liked the sound of , the name , so she had written down on his card Pandro . As for his cousin 's name , it was Bedros , with the b soft , which in turn had been changed at school to Pedro . It was all quite all right of course , and no harm to anybody . Without answering him , the elderly lady sat on the stool , adjusted her feet on the pedals of the organ , and without any instructions to us , began to play a song which , from its dullness , was obviously religious . After a moment she herself began to sing . Pandro , in a soft voice , uttered a very profane , if not vulgar , word , which fortunately Miss Balaifal did not hear . Miss Balaifal 's voice was , if anything , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sang , the tones of the organ were not any too clear , but even so , it was possible to know that Miss Balaifal 's voice was not delightful . Galilee , bright Galilee , she sang . She turned to us , nodded , and said , Now sing . Sing , boys . We knew neither the words nor the music , but it seemed that common courtesy demanded at least an honest effort , which we made , trying as far as possible to follow the music coming out of the organ and the dramatic words coming out of Miss Balaifal . Ruler of the storm was He , on the raging Galilee , she sang . In all , we tried to sing three songs . After each song , Pandro would say , Thank you very much , Miss Balaifum . Can we go now ? At last she got up from the organ and said , I 'm sure you 're the better for it . If evil friends invite you to drink , turn away . We 'll turn away , Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I will , I said . I will too , Pandro said . Can we go now , Miss Balaifum ? Read the pamphlets , she said . It 's not too ate . We 'll read them , Pandro said . Just as soon as we get time . We left the lady 's house and went back to the front yard of Pandro 's house and began to read the pamphlets . Before we were half through reading , the lady came out on the porch and in a very high and excited voice said , Which of you was it ? Which was what ? Pandro said . He was very bewildered . Which of you was it that sang ? Miss Balaifal said . We both sang , I said . No , Miss Balaifal said . Only one of you sang . One of you has a beautiful Christian voice . Not me , Pandro said . You , Miss Balaifal said to me . Eugene . Was it you ? Aram , I said . Not Eugene . No , I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Balaifal said . Who ? Pandro said . Both of you , the lady said . When we were in the house and Miss Balaifal was seated at the organ again Pandro said , I do n't want to sing I do n't like to sing . You sing , the lady said to me . I sang . Miss Balaifal leaped to her feet . You are the one , she said . You must sing at church . I wo n't , I said . You must n't use profane language , she said . I 'm not using profane language , I said , and I promise not to use profane language again as long as I live , but I wo n't sing in church . Your voice is the most Christian voice I have ever heard , Miss Balaifal said . It is n't , I said . Yes , it is , she said . Well , I wo n't sing anyway , I said . You must , you must , Miss Balaifal said . Thanks very much , Miss Balaifum , Pandro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to sing in church . He must , he must , the lady insisted . Why ? Pandro said . For the good of his soul , the lady said . Pandro whispered the profane word again . Now tell me , the lady said . What is your name ? I told her . You are a Christian of course ? she said . I guess so , I said . A Presbyterian of course , she said . I do n't know about that , I said . You are , the lady said . Of course you are . I want you to sing in the Tulare Street Presbyterian Church  --  in the Boys Choir  --  next Sunday . Why ? Pandro said again . We need voices , the lady explained . We must have young voices . We must have singers . He must sing next Sunday . I do n't like to sing , I said . I do n't like to go to church either . Boys , Miss Balaifal said . Sit down . I want to talk to you . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least thirty minutes . We did n't believe a word of it , although out of courtesy we kept answering her questions the way we knew she wanted us to answer them , but when she asked us to get down on our knees with her while she prayed , we would n't do it . Miss Balaifal argued this point for some time and then decided to let us have our way  --  for a moment . Then she tried again , but we would n't do it . Pandro said we 'd move the organ any time , or anything else Iike that , but we would n't get down on our knees . Well , Miss Balaifal said , will you close your eyes ? What for ? Pandro said . It 's customary for everybody to close his eyes while someone is praying , Miss Balaifal said . Who 's praying ? Pandro said . No one , yet , Miss Balaifal said . But if you 'll promise to close your eyes , I 'll pray , but you 've got to promise to close your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pandro is so , let me ask you to sing for me every said . Sunday .

I 've got the worst voice in the world , Pandro said with great pride . His poor voice would n't be worth ten cents to anybody , Miss Balaifal said . Not even a nickel , Pandro said . Well , I said , rim not going to sing  --  for a dollar and a quarter or anything else . I do n't need any money . You made a bargain , Miss Balaifal said . Yes , you did , Pandro said . I jumped on Pandro right in Miss Balaifal 's parlor and we began to wrestle . The elderly Christian lady tried to break it up , but since it was impossible to determine which of us was the boy with the angelic voice , she began to pray . The wrestling continued until most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organ . The match was eventually a draw , the wrestlers exhausted and flat on their backs . Miss Balaifal stopped praying and said , Sunday then , at a dollar and a quarter . It took me some time to get my breath . Miss Balaifal , I said , I 'll sing in that choir only if Pandro sings too . But his voice , Miss Balaifal objected . It 's horrible . I do n't care what it is , I said . If I sing , he 's got to sing too . I 'm afraid he 'd ruin the choir , Miss Balaifal said . He 's got to go up there with me every Sunday , I said , or nothing doing . Well , now , let me see , Miss Balaifal said . She gave the matter considerable thought . Suppose he goes up and stands in the choir , Miss Balaifal said , but does n't sing ? Suppose he just pretends to sing ? MAGAZINE That 's all right with me , I said , but he 's got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Pandro said . Well , now , Miss Balaifal said , I surely ca n't be expected to pay you too . If I go up there , Pandro said , I 've got to be paid . All right , Miss Balaifal said . One dollar for the boy who sings ; twenty-five cents for the boy who does n't . I 've got the worst voice in the world , Pandro said . You must be fair , Miss Balaifal said . After all , you wo n't be singing . You 'll just be standing there with the other boys . Twenty-five cents is n't enough , Pandro said . We got off the floor and began rearranging the furniture . All right , Miss Balaifal said . One dollar for the boy who sings . Thirty-five cents for the boy who does n't . Make it fifty , Pandro said . Very well , then , Miss Balaifal said . A dollar for you . Fifty cents for you . We start working next Sunday ? Pandro said . That 's right , Miss Balaifal said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not a word of this to any of the other boys in the choir . We wo n't mention it to anybody , Pandro said . In this manner , in the eleventh year of my life , I became , more or less , a Presbyterian  --  at least every Sunday morning . It was n't the money . It was simply that a bargain had been made , and that Miss Balaifal had her heart set on having me sing for religion . As I began to say six or seven minutes ago , however , a curious thing about our country is the ease with which all of us , ? or at least everybody I know  --  are able to change our religions , without any noticeable damage to anything or anybody . When I was thirteen I was baptized into the Armenian Catholic Church , even though I was still singing for the Presbyterians , and even though I myself was growing a little skeptical , as it were , of the whole conventional religious pattern , and was eager , by hook or crook , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to terms with Omnipotence in my own way . Even after I was baptized , I carried in my heart a deep discontent . Two months after I was baptized my voice changed , and my contract with Miss Balaifal was cancelled  --  which was a great relief to me and a terrible blow to her . I was born a Catholic . I was not baptized until I was thirteen . At that time I had been a Presbyterian for al-most two years of Sundays . After being baptized my voice changed . I stopped being a Presbyterian . As for the Armenian Catholic Church on Ventura Avenue , I went there only on Easter and Christmas . All the rest of the time I moved from one religion to another , and in the end was none the worse for it , so that now , like most Americans , my faith consists in believing in every religion , including my own , but without any ill-will toward anybody , no matter what he believes or disbelieves , just so his personality is good .
