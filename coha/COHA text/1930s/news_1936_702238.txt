txt The sudden recognition of the Spanish Rebels by Germany and Italy was accepted here today as part of the antiCommunist " holy war " now being organized with such sound and fury by all Fascist countries , great and small . For the present Britain is con vinced that it is only a war of words . She believes Germany , Italy , Japan and their satellites are making a great deal of noise and a great show of standing together against an imaginary menace to impress the world with their power . Britain is also sure that the crusaders in this strange war of doctrines do not intend for a long time to launch their guns , tanks and bombing planes against their common foe . But she does not like the looks of the alignment , whose outlines are becoming sharper every day , She regards it as mischievous and disruptive now and a possible threat to herself in some remote future . Move Toward Russia For this reason she probably will draw closer to Russia again , after several months of coolness in Anglo-Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity of a common AngloAmerican policy in the Pacific , where the interests of the two Anglo-Saxon powers coincide . All this , however , is for the future . No crisis is expected to result from today 's Italo-German move , which had been anticipated for many weeks . The threat of a sea blockade of Barcelona , which was communicated to the British Government today in a circular from Burgos , Rebel headquarters in Northern Spain , brings with it the danger of an " incident , " but such danger is inherent in all blockades . It is not to be expected that Britain will admit General Francisco Franco 's right to bombard Barcelona indiscriminately without first indicating a safety zone for neutral shipping , for which there are established precedents . At the moment , the cruiser Arethusa , flagship of Britain 's Third Cruiser Squadron , is in Catalan waters with several destroyers , but the British do not expect these vessels to be needed for anything except evacuation of foreigners from Barcelona . Legal Status Unchanged London 's view is that recognition itself does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least . Germany and Italy are still bound , like the rest of Europe , not to intervene openly on behalf of the Rebels , however much assistance they may be providing behind the screen of official policy . The British Government believes there will be no immediate aban- donment of official neutrality , either by the Fascist powers , which have sympathized openly with the Spanish Rebels since the civil war began , or by Russia , which has just as ardently sympathized with the Madrid government . Unless there is a further change of policy in Berlin , Rome or Moscow , the useful fiction of neutrality will be continued , regardless of what happened today . Officials pointed out tonight that there was no reason why recognition of a new government should imply open assistance for it . Britain and France still recognize the Madrid government as the legitimate ruler of Spain , yet they have applied a rigorous arms embargo and declared they will not intervene . That policy is going to be I continued even if Germany and Italy should decide in the near future to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize General Franco in the immediate future , it was stated emphatically in official quarters here , and will not be in a hurry to recognize him even if he becomes undisputed master of Spain . If the Rebels capture Madrid , the British charg ? d'affaires will be instructed to make contact with the Insurgent leaders so as to protect British lives and property . The British Minister acted similarly when the Italians marched into Addis Ababa , and this did not involve recognition . Nor will Britain lift her arms embargo even if Germany , Italy and Portugal should scramble openly to supply General Franco with weapons . The British are determined not to burn their fingers in Spain , no matter what other nations may do . There is always the disturbing thought that if Germany and Italy quit the non-intervention committee they may claim the right to board and search Soviet vessels bound for Catalan ports , but if the worst came officials here are confident Russia would not go to war over such an incident .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
