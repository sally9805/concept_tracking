txt THE SILENT DRYS . Literary Digest poll Called Unfair to Those Favoring Prohibition . To the Editor of The New York Times : Pertinent to the question " Are the drys voting in The Literary Digest poll ? " the following analysis of the returns is offered : The nine States generally conceded as containing the greatest percentage of wet sentiment , and comprising less than one-third the population . of the United States according to the 1920 census , have cast nearly onehalf the total votes which have been counted to date . States . Votes Counted . Population . Massachusetts 149.295 3,852,356 Rhode Island 16,643 604,397 Connecticut 84,752 1,380,631 New York 511,401 10,385,227 New Jersey 212,569 3,155,900 Pennsylvania 438,896 8,720,017 Maryland 41,406 1.440,661 Illinois 232,752 6,185,280 Wisconsin 82,488 2,632,067 Total for above 1,770,202 38,365,358 Expressed in other words , the percentage of population voting in the aforementioned States was 4.6 per cent , while but 2.4 per cent of the balance of the country was polled . Whether the more populous centres , which it is generally admitted are preponderatingly wet , have received an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fact remains , however , that the wet sections are voting most heavily . Since this condition is evident in comparing one State with another , it is reasonable to assume that the same applies in comparing different communities within the same State . Upon this premise the conclusion is inevitable that the dry sentiment is far from being fairly represented . REYNOLDS LONGFIELD . Garnerville , N. Y. , April 26 , 1930 . Avoidable Accidents . To the Editor of The New York Times : May I thank you for the very helpful editorial in THE TIMES of April 22 concerning the State Department of Labor ' report on industrial accidents ? I appreciate your stressing the point of the avoidability of industrial accidents and the value of educational campaigns among workers . Many people , both employers and workers , are particularly blind to the dangers inherent in ( heir own occupations until such dangers are called to their attention , either forcibly through accidents or through repeated ' admonitions and warnings . The public also is generally apathetic and without appreciation of the large amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although accident prevention is but one feature of the varied work of the State Department of Labor , there is perhaps no other whose progress is more dependent upon the education of the public to its purposes and meaning . An important editorial utterance concerning this aspect of our work is therefore of incalculable value . FRANCES PERKINS , Industrial Commissioner . New York , April 26 , 1930 . JUDGE PARKER 'S DECISIONS . Some of the Important Cases in Which He Has Written Opinions . It has been suggested by a few that the judicial career of Judge Parker has not been sufficiently " outstanding . " It is worth while , therefore , to consider it briefly . Appointed by President Coolidge to the bench of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in October , 1925 , the first decision in which Judge Parker participated was handed down Nov. 28 of that year , and the first case in which he wrote the opinion of the court was decided Jan. 12 , 1926 . In a little over four years he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually written the opinions of his court in no less than one hundred and fifty litigations . They cover a large and varied field of legal subjects . These include such topics as admiralty , adverse possession , bankruptcy , banks , bills and notes , carriers , colleges ( liability of for torts ) , contracts , corporations , counties , courts , criminal law , eminent domain , fraudulent conveyances , injunctions , insurance , interstate commerce , labor litigation , municipal corporations , negligence , patents , police power , practice and procedure , principal and agent , prohibition , railroads , rate regulation , sales , search and seizure , suretyship , taxation , trespass . Judge Parker was the author of the opinion in the case of Ettlinger against the Trustees of RandolphMacon College , in Virginia , in which had been asserted the liability in damages of that institution for injuries to a student who had jumped from the window of a burning building , involving the responsibility of educational institutions generally for the negligence of their officers and employes . In this case Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution without expectation of profit , acquiring the property through charitable gifts and bequests and charging less than cost for board and tuition , was an eleemosynary organization , and as such was not liable for injuries to a student because of the negligence of the officers , agents or servants of the institution . Another interesting case , involving originality in the application of old principles to new conditions , turned upon the contention that the death of one insured under an accident policy , which resulted from drinking what was supposed to be an ordinary gin cocktail but which in reality contained wood alcohol , was a consequence of an acciderrtal cause within the purview of the policy . The affirmative of this proposition was sustained by Judge Parker . In a prosecution for selling intoxicating liquor pursuant to a plan for entrapment , the defendant , informed of the designs of the prohibition enforcement officers , accepted the money , but delivered a jar of water instead of liquor . It was urged on the part of the United States that , because the defendant had accepted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in return , he was guilty of a violation of law , though liquor was not in fact delivered . But " the offense of illegally selling liquor , " ruled Judge Parker , " is not committed by a bargain or executory contract for a sale . " In his opinions in " search and seizure " cases , Judge Parker has frequently upheld . the liberty of the ini dividual . " The rights guaranteed by , the Fourth Amendment are not to be encroached upon or gradually de , preciated by the imperceptible prise. tice of courts or by well-intentioned but mistakenly overzealous executive officers , " announced Judge Parker . t But where the evidence had ifairl , shown a violation of the national pr . hibition act , Judge Parker it * e for strict enforcement , ' Thus iii el case which arose in West Virgintel Judge Parker sustained the foS. feature of an automobile proved trii be the property of a wife living witii. her husband , where the vehicle hal been used in the transportation o intoxicating liquor by the husbamt under circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or connivance , Then , too , Judge Parker 's court , 14 ; judgments in which he has Comm curred , has decided cases for , as welt as against , organized labor . In one such case it was held that the of . ficers of a labor union would not 14 bound by a decree of injunction is. sued some years previously against their predecessors in office , deter+ mining the rights of parties as of that time . In this case ( decided in , 1926 ) it was also declared that an injunction against labor union of . ficials would not be deemed to pro . hibit the use of lawful propaganda to increase union membership . It is interesting also to consider , that the official reports of decisions indicate a surprisingly small num. ber of cases in which Judge Parker wrote the opinions for his court which have been reversed on appeal to the United States Supreme Court : In fact , only two such examples have been noted , and of these one was not reversed on the merits but because , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in existence and , as the Supreme Court said , " to dismiss the appeals would leave the injunction in force . " The only other reversal of a case in which Judge Parker wrote which has come to my attention was where Judge Parker had decided that a Federal intermediate credit bank could not maintain an action in a District Court of the United States , the act of Congress under which the bank was organized providing that the bank , for the purposes of jurisdiction , should be deemed a citizen of the State where it is located , There was strong analogy from decided cases for this position . Judge Parker 's judicial record is significant in another respect . There have been extremely few dissenting opinions by the other members of the Circuit Court of Appeals in cases in which Judge Parker has written the opinion of the court . In fact , only , one such example has been observed , and on this occasion , on appeal to the United States Supreme Court , Judge Parker 's opinion was sus. tained . Judge Parker also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important case of the United States agaiipt Virginia Shipbuilding Corporation , fustaining a judgment in favor of i:he United States and against that corporation and one of its subsidiaries for an amount which , including interest , was . over U6,000,000 . LAWYER. , New York , April 28 , 1930 . POWER AND LIGHT RATES . A Consumer Compares His Bills Here and in Canada . To the Editor of The New York Times : In your issue of April 25 you publish a letter from Mr. Carlisle , chairman of the Niagara Hudson Power Corporation , in which he complains that Governor Roosevelt 's statement dealing with power rates " creates the impression that the rates within the territory of our companies are much higher than those in the Province of Ontario , " and he adds , " The Ontario sales bear practically no taxes . " I lived in Toronto from the birth of the Hydro-Electric system until August , 1926 , and in New York City since that time . I have therefore a healthy realization of the difference in the rates charged there and here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I paid in Toronto during the first six months of 1926 with what I paid here for the same period in 1927 . Here are the figures : TORONTO-1926 . January and February . $3.31 March and April 2.64 May and June 2.23 Total $8.18 . NEW YORK CITY-1927 . Jan. 10 to Feb .. 10 $5.49 Feb. 10 to March 10 4.41 March 10 to April 11 3.83 Aprll 11 to May 11 3.32 May 11 to June 10 3.74 June 10 to July 12 3.74 Total $24.53 Those are the actual payments . I had the same-sized family and apartment in Toronto and used exactly the same electric utensils . The charge that " Ontario sales bear practically no taxes " is a familiar one and is not true . The executive head of the Smithsonian Institution of Washington , D. C. , published a report in 1925 in a volume bearing the title " Smithsonian Institution 's Study of Natural Resources  --  Niagara Falls , Its Power Possibilities and Preservation , " written by Samuel S. Wyer , associate in mineral technology , United States National Museum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ontario and United States Electric Service Compared . " In seeking to explain why in Ontario the rates are " considerably below those prevailing in the United States , " ? Mr. Wyer asserts : " The governmentally owned hydroelectric system * * * in Ontario is not taxed . " Sir Adam Beck , chairman of the Ontario system , in a report published in 1925 , declares Mr. Wyer 's statement to be " absolutely false . " Here is what Sir Adam says : " The Hydro-Electric Power Com- mission of Ontario pays taxes both to municipalities and to the Provincial Government , to the extent of hundreds of thousands of dollars annually , not only on land which it occupies , but in connection with other properties which it operates ; In addition , the commission has paid millions of dollars in customs duties to the government of Canada , did rectly and indirectly , ? on materials and equipment which must be ported from the United States and other countries  --  a charge for which there is no similar expense of comp+ parable magnitude in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " From the consumers ' standpoint it is worth remembering that in Ontario the element of profit is entirely removed and that municipal services are supplied at cost , and Sir Adam says , " In this regard the saving to the taxpayers has been estimated to be substantially in excess of $1,000,000 annually . " JOHN G. O'DONOGHUE . Jamaica , N. Y. , April 29 , 1930 . What Gray Wrote . To the Editor of The New York Times : An interesting editorial in THE TIMES of April 27 , " On the Tip of the Tongue , " dealing with the difficulty of quoting accurately from memory , took as its starting point the ninth stanza of Gray 's " Elegy , " of which it printed the third line as , Await alike th ' Inevitable hour . The line is frequently so printed , but the correct reading is " awaits , " not " await . " A manuscript copy in Gray 's own hand , on exhibition in the British Museum and published by the museum in facsimile , ' plainly reads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the subject of " awaits " ; the first two lines give its object . A little reflection will convince one that a writer so careful and precise as Gras ' could not have written " await , " witlx the first two lines as subject and " thi inevitable hour " as object . That would be equivalent to saying that the noble , the powerful , the beautiful and the wealthy spend their time waiting for the hour of their death . No , it is " th ' inevitable hour " which lies in wait for The boast of heraldry , the pomp of power . And all that beauty , all that wealth e'er ? gave . They spend their time advancing along " the paths of glory , " forgetful of death , but somewhere on his path each finds " th ' inevitable hour " awaiting him : The paths of glory lead but to the rave .
