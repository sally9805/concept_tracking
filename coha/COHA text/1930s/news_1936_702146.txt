txt Our Foreign Trade Early in this administration I called attention to the similarity in phraseology between 's definition of insanity and President Roosevelt 's definition of the New Deal . Both , as I recall it in effect , contained " A prolonged change in the usual method of thinking . " The comparison was then published , I assume , because it was amusing . Subsequent events have proved , however , that the two conditions thus defined are in reality dangerously similar . For instance : When our competitors for world trade voice their delight over the way our new treaties play into their hands . Washington points to this joyous approval as a feather In the cap of our government . By the same line of cockeyed reasoning , if they could make us import all that we consume , and export nothing , these trade treaties would be perfect . CHARLES B. SLADE . New York , Sent . 25 , 1936.
