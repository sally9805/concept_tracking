Hypercompetitive , bubble-riding , style-mad is the $100,000,000 U. S. millinery industry . The Federal Trade Commission last week published a study of its scrambled distribution methods . Prime thesis of the report : chain and syndicate distributors ( who combine the functions of wholesaler and retailer ) handle close to half of the total trade , are not the pirates that manufacturing milliners think them : " With a better understanding the manufacturer will come to realize that he has not been the victim of oppression by the syndicate . " <P> Engaging are some of FTC 's findings : <P> &gt; A few weeks after headgear is brought out as the new thing , it may be old hat . " Millinery . . . has no intrinsic value at all . . . . " <P> &gt; On fewer than 20% , of the 1,300 styles which New York City 's 500 millinery manufacturers try out each year are there sizable repeat orders . <P> &gt; " . . . The store that operates its own millinery department and is dependent for merchandise upon infrequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . can not hope to keep up with the style demands of the consumer . " <P> &gt; Important are millinery departments managed by syndicates , on lease , in department stores . One trick of less responsible syndicates : 1 ) to use a store 's good name to sell bad goods at a high price , later move on to a new store . <P> &gt; " Unlike industries requiring a substantial capital investment " ( in New York City , which accounts for 56% of millinery production , total equipment is estimated at $1,000,000 ) , " hard times produce an increase in the number of millinery manufacturers . The failure of one concern results in the formation of three or four new concerns , for the owners , salesmen and factory workers of the firm which goes out of business . . . start new factories of their own .
