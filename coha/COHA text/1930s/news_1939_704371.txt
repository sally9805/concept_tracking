txt With thirty-six of her crew buried on Uruguayan soil , the pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee , which Germany expected would revolutionize naval warfare , lay today in the mouth of the River Plate , a broken and twisted mass of black and burning wreckage . Of her complement 1,039 members of the crew , including Captain Hans Langsdorff and other officers , are in Buenos Aires , Argentina , where they went last night in the expectation of being treated as shipwreck survivors . It seemed very probable tonight , however , that they would be interned . The Argentine Foreign Ministry announced that the officers and crew of the Graf Spee would be interned , The United Press reported from Buenos Aires . If this should happen , it would make even more useless Captain Langsdorff 's futile gesture of destroying his ship rather than interning her and the crew in Uruguay . Battleships represent so much in tradition and honor that no one can visit the tragic ruins of the Graf Spee , as this correspondent did this afternoon , without being deeply impressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so ignoble an end . Near Mutiny Reported It is easy to believe a report current here today that several officers and other members of the crew almost mutinied when their commander informed them of the fate awaiting their vessel . They are said to have insisted that it was far better to be sunk in battle and go down in glory . But Captain Langsdorff had his orders direct from Chancellor Hitler . Also , Captain Langsdorff prides himself that in all his raiding he has not lost a man of the enemy ship ? and thus he refused to commit mass suicide with his crew of young Germans , little more than boys . All that is left of the four-year-old $19,000,000 warrior is a shapeless mass of scrap iron . She fought only one battle and ran away from that . The Graf Spee is still burning with the fury of a blast furnace , making it impossible to believe Captain Langsdorff 's explanation that the ship sought refuge in Montevideo Harbor because she was short of fuel . Not a Menace to Navigation The Graf Spee is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred-mile river just outside the channel that light draft vessels use in going to Buenos Aires . She is not a menace to navigation because she is outside that channel , but Uruguayan port authorities planted a wreckage buoy near her last night to warn shipping to keep clear . The position of the wreck indicates that the fatal bomb that destroyed the ship was planted in the powder magazine under the aft turret . It must have blown the whole bottom out of the vessel 's stern . The ship 's entire after deck is under water and only the ends of two of her torpedo tubes are visible . The whole ship has listed heavily to starboard and that side of the deck is under water . The port side deck is above water forward from the funnel and fighting tower . The funnel , with its surrounding superstructure has been torn clear away from the ship and is hanging heavily over the starboard side . White hot flames are still pouring out of it , however , as fumes from the fuel oil are ignited by the oxygen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of interning the cargo ship Tacoma , which carried more than half of the Graf Spee 's crew out of the harbor yesterday and transferred them to barges for their trip to Buenos Aires . Under international law a merchant vessel of a belligerent power can be interned if sailors from a warship have boarded her and worked on her as in the case of the Tacoma . Because of the already delicate situation with Germany , the Uruguyans are hesitating about taking any action regarding the Tacoma . The ship is still under arrest and no one is allowed on or off her . The captain also is under technical arrest for his participation In yesterday 's events . Spee Sailors Are Detained MONTEVIDEO , Uruguay , Dec. 18 ( UP ) ? Four members of the crew of the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee were held today by Uruguayan authorities , and although there was no official order for their arrest they were expected to be interned here . The men , a corporal , a fireman and two ordinary seamen , were taken off the German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Graf Spee was blown up . The four were reported reliably to have been taken from the Tacoma , which had followed the Graf Spee put of this harbor late yesterday afternoon , after officials aboard a government launch said they had seen them inside Uruguayan territorial waters after the warship was scuttled . The Germans were said to have set off the blast from one of the Graf Spee 's launches under orders of Captain Hans Langsdorff , commander of the vessel . It is understood this government contends that as sailors of a belligerent country they are subject to arrest by Uruguay under this nation 's neutrality laws . It was emphasized , however , that such action would depend entirely on the point at which they originally were seen by Uruguayan authorities . Argentina to Intern Crew BUENOS AIRES , Argentina , Dec. 18 ( UP ) ? Captain Hans Langsdorff , commander of the scuttled German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee , and 1,000 of his officers and crew , who landed here today , will be interned , the Foreign Office announced . Internment will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XV of The Hague Convention of 1907 . That article , which concerns the rights and duties of neutrals , provides that a neutral country must intern belligerent forces that have taken refuge in its territory . It was believed that the crew members would be lodged until the end of the European war on the small island of Martin Garcia , in the River Plate . The officers were expected to be allowed to live in Buenos Aires on their word not to attempt to escape . No Renewal of Struggle The Foreign Office indicated that it would not allow any renewal of the diplomatic struggle between Great Britain and Germany over the status of the Graf Spee and her crew . The fact that Captain Langsdorff , his officers and crew were brought here aboard two Argentine tugs , a barge and a launch , the first three vessels evidently contracted for the trip by German diplomats here , precludes any argument that the men are not liable to internment under the Hague Convention , the Foreign Office said . The men arrived here after a twenty-hour trip from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spee was blown up and sunk at dusk yesterday . Two hundred and fifty , including Captain Langsdorff , were lodged temporarily at the naval arsenal , while the remaining 750 were taken to the Hotel de Immigrantes alongside the arsenal . Visibly weary and tired , Captain Langsdorff personally supervised the landing of the crew members , barking orders as 7,000 persons who jammed the small dock space loudly cheered the German sailors . The men were herded into a temporary internment site nearby immediately after landing . A majority appeared to be youths between the ages of 18 and 21 . They obeyed orders with marked discipline , and chatted with each other . All showed the effects of their experience last evening off the Uruguayan coast . Their uniforms were soiled and all the men had an unkempt appearance . Captain Langsdorff , who traveled here aboard the tug Coloso from the spot near the Uruguayan shore where the Graf Spee lay , was quoted as saying en route : " I am satisfied . I saved all my men .
