Cool on the banks of piney Lake Mendota rests the quiet city of Madison , centre of a rich dairy and farming area , home of Wisconsin 's State capitol and State university . Last week , though no petroleum has ever been found there , Madison became also the temporary capital of the U. S. oil industry . In the biggest trust-busting case since the famed dissolution of Standard Oil , the Federal Government last week brought to trial in Madison 18 major U. S. oil companies , five of their subsidiaries , three oil trade journals and 57 ranking oilmen. * Under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act all stood criminally indicted for having " combined and conspired , beginning in February 1935 ... to raise and fix prices of gasoline sold in ... ten States of the Middle West . " <P> In the spring of 1936 Attorney General Homer Stille Cummings announced that the Department of Justice would investigate complaints of price-fixing . Presently a Federal grand jury began sitting in Madison , chosen because Wisconsin is the most centrally located of the ten States in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do business there . A year ago having examined some 18 tons of documents and endured sweltering heat for the longest period any Federal grand jury has ever sat in a Department of Justice case , the jury charged the defendants with price-fixing by : 1 ) operating two buying pools to acquire gasoline from independent refiners at artificial prices ; 2 ) selling gasoline to jobbers under long-term contracts in which price would be determined by the average of the spot market prices published in the Chicago Journal of Commerce and Platt 's Oilgram ; 3 ) taking " distress " ( i.e. , excess ) gasoline off the market ( TIME , Aug. 17 , 1936 ) . Result , according to the jury , was severe losses to jobbers and independents . <P> Far from denying such charges , oilmen plaintively asserted that this was merely what they had been directed to do by the New Deal and NRA . Best summary yet of the situation from the oilman 's point of view was the remark of one executive : " The oil industry feels like a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . ... " Last week , when trial finally got under way on the second floor of Madison 's eight-year-old Federal building , it was obvious that this would be the major line of defense . <P> Sitting on the bench in the stuffy courtroom last week was Judge Patrick Thomas Stone , 48 , regular presiding justice for the district . Appointed by President Roosevelt in 1933 , he is softspoken , dignified , erect , has a reputation for scrupulous fairness . That he would tolerate no undue fuss and delay became apparent when he succeeded in getting a jury chosen on the first day , instead of allowing the week that had been estimated would be necessary . His sternness was also apparent in the first skirmish of the trial , when Prosecutor Hammond Edward Chaffetz , 30 , who has been with the Department of Justice since graduation from Harvard Law School seven years ago , tried to forestall the obvious plan of the defense to shoulder all blame on the New Deal . Prosecutor Chaffetz asked Judge Stone to forbid the defense to assert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters from President Roosevelt or Secretary of the Interior Ickes to substantiate the assertion .
