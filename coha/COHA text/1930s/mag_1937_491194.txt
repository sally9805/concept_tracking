NEXT to Franklin Delano Roosevelt , the most important man in the United States in the next four years is likely to he the Honorable Thomas Jefferson Jones , an average member of the House of Representatives . On him will rest the responsibility of determining the future relationship between the executive and legislative branches of the American Government . Will the servility to which the President has reduced Congress become the permanent condition of the legislative branch ? Is Congress to resume its ancient independence ? Torn Jeff will decide . Torn Jeff is what you get if you take the 334 Democratic members of the now House which meets this week , add all their qualities and divide by 334 . What you get is not a hero . He is forty-five , big framed , and so pudgy by now that he has considerable difficulty in squeezing into his old uniform for the veterans ' parades . He is growing slightly bald , the slabs of fat on his cheeks are thickening , and lately he has taken to wearing octagonal glasses . His clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him the flowing Prince Alberts of old-fashioned statesmanship . Indeed , his only remarkable physical characteristic is his ability to keep both ears to the ground at once . A Democrat more by chance than by conviction , Tom Jeff comes from a state which used to be thought solidly Republican . He entered the House in 1932 , in the first of that succession of landslides which has ended by making Republican congressmen almost worthy of preservation in the Smithsonian  --  so rare , indeed , that if congressional independence is to revive , Tom Jeff and his fellow Democrats must revive it . Tom Jeff spends most of his time on Capitol Hill , either on the floor , where he is given to rambling , verbose orations full of references to " our great leader , Franklin D. Roosevelt , " or in his office . The filing cabinets along his office walls contain the principal fruits of his four years ' labors in Washington-7000 envelopes , each enclosing a long file of correspondence concerning a job for one of his constituents ; 1500 envelopes full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of correspondence on public works , relief projects , CCC camps , Resettlement 's miniature Utopias and such things in his home district . Sometimes , after a drink or so , he complains mournfully that he is no better than an errand boy for the folks back home , and , in the main , he is quite right . Way down deep , he hankers to be a statesman . He wishes he had time to study more of the bills he votes for so docilely . Yet he feels that running errands is safer , so he contents himself with trying to understand the legislation handled by his own committee . Visit the House one afternoon . You will see a desert of empty seats , uphol-stered in leather of an unpleasant blue color , and around the well of the cham-ber an oasis of humanity  --  perhaps seventy-five solons  --  gossiping , studying the entry cards of the Maryland race tracks , dozing , or merely sitting , resting their tired minds in a happy vacuity un-til it is their turn to speak . If Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he glances apprehensively toward the gal-leries from time to time . He is looking for a possible opponent in the next elec-tion , come to the Capitol to got the goods on him . Tom Jeff never forgets that congressional elections happen every two years , and he regards running errands for the folks bank home as the best kind of biennial-disaster insurance . With fewer errands to run at this session , Torn Jeff is going to feel rather like an unhappy sufferer from the morning of ter a long drunk . You see , he finds patronage and money for his district supremely intoxicating . In the last four years , 111,000 old non-Civil-Service jobs and 214,000 now ones have been shared out among the deserving Democrats , and the Federal Government has poured out $10,000,000,000 or so in emergency expenditures . Like a man on a bender , anxious only about the next drink , Tom Jeff has been so busy getting his share and so grateful to the President for what he has got , // that . ho has been glad to vote with the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonus and the veterans ' pay-cut-restoration bill were the solitary occasions of his revolt . Now all that is over . The New Deal patronage pie , Gargantuan pasty though it was , has been gobbled up , and the President himself appears to be determined to cut off the torreet of public money which has poured so pleasingly into Tom Jeff 's district . Moreover , the President is about to enter his second term , and , in the past , second terms have always encouraged members of the President 's party in Congress to shift for themselves . All these things considered , it really looks as though Tom Jeff would assert his own independence again pretty soon . He and his fellows must choose a new course . Their choice is important simply because a legislative body can survive four years of servility , but after eight , its faculty of criticism and revolt will atrophy for good . In reducing Congress to servility , the President has merely done what every one of his predecessors would have liked to do , and what most of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . where President Roosevelt has had billions of the public money and hundreds of thousands of jobs at his command , President . Hoover , a less imaginative man , tried to get by on breakfast . sausage and a patronage pie which had been rather completely cut by Harding and Coolidge . The President will do his best to keep Tom Jeff obedient ; every public man believes that he knows best . But he has not only lost his weapons of patronage and public largesse . He has more Tom Jeffs to deal with in the new Congress than over before , both in the House and in the Senate , where the Honorable Achitophel Jenkins , senior senator from Torn Jeff 's state , is going to suffer the same sort of rude awakening as TomJeir is . In essence the President is faced with the unpleasant task that was tackled so triumphantly by the old woman who lived in a shoe , who had so many children she did n't know what to do . If you do n't remember her : There was an old woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children she did n't know what to do ; She gore them some broth without any bread , And whipped them all soundly and put them to bed . The Democratic Deluge T HE President must not only make Tom Jeff like broth without any bread ; he must make Tom Jeff 's innumerable colleagues like it . That is a fourth trouble for him . Legislative majorities are always more manageable , more willing to hew to the party line when they are small and fairly well matched by the opposition , Before election , the President 's congressional leaders were even heartless enough to hope that the Democratic majority in the House would be cut down fifty seats . Instead , it was increased thirteen seats , and while the President may he rather flattered by the extra evidence of the electorate 's handsome endorsement of his policies , the leaders are frankly peevish . Soon after the new majority had been counted , one of them said snappishly : " We 've got so many damn-fool Democrats round here now that it 's a God 's pity we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat litters ; pick out the ones we want to keep and drown the rest .. " The leaders , who are careful students of Tom Jcfrs psychology , predict that for four months he will continue as biddable as ever . In that period , they plan to shove through appropriation bills promising far less opulently for Tom Jeff 's district , and a big governmental reorganization scheme which will not only darken Tom Jeff 's prospect of future patronage but even return some of his present jobholders to the ranks of the unemployed . Then they expect Tom Jeff and his friends , cut to the quick by such brutal treatment. , to begin gathering into Woes . They fear that from Tom Jeff 's hurt feelings will grow an ardent desire to do something extra , something more handsome than the Administration is prepared to do , for labor and the farmers and the aged . Whether this first manifestation of Tom Jeff 's independence can be beaten , or whether independence will become a habit with him , the leaders do n't know . Speaker William B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent , a strong disciplinarian ; Representatives John O'Connor , of New York , and Sam Rayburn , of Texas , the irascible Tammany politician and the shrewd quiet Southerner who have been fighting for the floor leadership ; Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee Bob Doughton , lanky , obstinate North Carolina cattleman , whose despotism is tempered with kindliness ; Chairman of the Appropriations Committee " Buck " Buchanan , a Texan of the frontier , who used to carry a six-shooter , who has the best luck at . poker , the softest voice and the smallest feet in the House  --  these are the leaders through whom the President must deal with Tom Jeff this year . Every one of them is a party man , first. , last and foremost , and they have given the President . what he wanted in the past because they are party men . The thought of the party and the President 's own amazing personal charm have always soothed their rebellions . The President has made them his straw bosses in a mass-production legislative industry . Right here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has done to Congress , and what his new independence may do . Heaven knows , there have been bossed Congresses before . When that witty tyrant , Tom Reed , first of the great House Czars , got ready to let the Democrats in on the Republican legislative program , he used to begin his announcement : " Gentlemen , William and Mark and I have decided to perpetrate the following outrage . " They perpetrated their outrage with no one to let or hinder . But William  --  President McKinley  --  did not command Mark Hanna , the Republican giant of the Senate , and Tom Reed , Speaker of the House , to perpetrate any outrages . The two branches of the Government , personified in the triumvirate , met together and picked their outrage in equal council . In the past four years , on the other hand , any Democratic leader who presumed to hint that he had an equal voice with the President in determining the party program , or any voice at all above a whisper , for that matter , would have provoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President and his intimate advisers in the departments have decided what , they wanted , have written the bills , and have handed them to the legislative leadership with orders to make them laws without changing a single important comma . All the huffing and puffing of some of the leaders , all the occasional parade of congressional independence , has been so much piffle . The leaders , who have their positions by virtue of seniority as well as ability , can well remember Congresses before the New Deal . They have not been altogether delighted by their new unimportance , but they have been maneuvered into a position where they must take it and like it , as Vice President Garner rather forcibly explained to them during the holding-company-bill fight . Then the House , terrified by floods of protesting telegrams from home , jibbed for the first and last time at an item on the New Deal program . Many of the telegrams were fakes , but the mere sight of any telegram from home gives Tom Jeff the jitters . The House did not want the famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to get it in he forgot his usual suavity and cracked the whip over the leaders . They were angry , discouraged , ready to give the whole business up , when Vice President Garner interrupted their plaints against the President with the remark : It . do n't matter a damn what kind of guy you say he is ; he 's your guy just the same . And never forget one thing . He 's the whole Democratic Party just now , whether you like it or not , and if you do n't believe it , go ask your people . " The leaders knew that the old Uvalde fox spoke truth . They put the screws on the House a little harder , and the recollection that the President was the fountain of patronage and public money , and the exposure of the faked telegrams converted Tom Jeff and his friends to the death-sentence clause . The President got . what he wanted . The President has short-circuited the leaders ; how , can best be judged by the recent history of the pork-barrel bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depended on the congressional leaders to get pork for their districts into the appropriation bills . One of the first things the President did was substitute for the old **25;1004;TOOLONG bill the new lump-suns appropriation bill , which gives him the power to pass out the pork . The President , not the party nor its leaders in Congress , is the source of all the things Tom Jeff wants . The President has es-tablished a party dictatorship , of which the first real ' test will come in . this Congress , now that so many of the things Tom Jeff wants are . rso longer at tLe President 's disposal . Probably patronage is what Tom Jeff wants most , and will miss most . Certainly it is what he and his friends have spent the most time getting in the last four years . It may be superstition in Tom Jeff to put so high a value on patronage , but every politician S ' before him has believed that jobs should be the reward of the organization faithful , and Tom Jeff is no political nonconformist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the Democrats got control of the House , a friend noticed old Percy Quin , of Mississippi , an honest and an earthy fellow who was slated to be chairman of the powerful Military Affairs Committee , standing in the House lobby , pensively watching the elevators . The friend offered old Percy a penny for his thoughts . " I 'm just standing here enjoying myself , " he replied . " thinking of what 's the first thing we 're going to do , now we 're on top . We 're going to throw out the damn Republicans and get . some good Democrats running them elevators . That 's the first thing we 're going to do . " The Elevator Barometer OW there are Democrats running the elevators N in every Federal building in the country , and nine-tenths of the occupants of the elevators are Democrats too . Tom Jeff has done his share of the great work , but how ? Well , a few days after Tom Jeff arrived on Capitol Hill , walking on air , believing himself a blend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualities , he received a nice letter from the great Mr. Farley himself . The giver of all good things complimented him on his splendid victory , and informed him that he need only come to the Postmaster General 's office to be served . It seemed to Tom . Jeff that the day of Jubilo had arrived a week or so later , when all the postmaster-ships in his district  --  around seventy of them  --  were turned over to him for distribution to deserving Democrats as the terms of the Republican incumbents ended . But by that time the letters of the job hunters had begun to pour into his office . They arrived , twenty , fifty , a hundred of them , in every mail , and each one of them seared Tom Jeff 's kind heart . Tom Jeff rolled up his sleeves . His first attack was on Mr. Emil Hurja , the great Mr. Farley 's assistant , and , as the inventor of a scientific system of patronage accounting , a genius in his own right . Mr. Hurjs , believed that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the 214,000 new non-Civil-Service jobs Tom Jeff was helping to create every time he voted for a bill setting up another New Deal agency , should be distributed in a businesslike way . Under his patent system , application cards were filled out in triplicate and filed by the Democratic National Committee under the names of the job seeker , the job seeker 's congressional sponsor , and his state . Tom Jeff marveled when the rising genius of the Democracy showed him his system , and was delighted when Mr. Hurja promised him a. nice block of jobs . Unhappily , the letters continued to pour in , and Tom Jeff 's secretary , an old hand on the Hill , had a dark suspicion that Mr. Hurja 's real and rather shocking purpose was to get Torn Jeff on his books , to see that he got no more patronage than he was owed . Tom Jeff , independent in this at least , set to work on his own . For every job hunter who was neither actually insane nor e Republican he wrote letters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a particular friend of mine , a lifelong Democrat . and a special case . " He had printed one little form on which job seekers suspected of Republican infection could get the endorsement of the organization back home , and another little form on which the Democratic National Committee could give its clearance to constituents looking for jobs . Some of the department personnel officers , like Julien N. Friant , of Agriculture and Resettlement. , demand clearance from the committee as well as from a Democratic congressman . Tom Jeff 's letters and the little forms came to be the commonplaces of the day 's mail in all the departments . Tom Jeff made his real effort , however , over the truly deserving Democrats , the men and women of some importance to the organization back home . He telephoned Mr. Friant , Edgar Puryear at the Public Works Administration , and the other personnel officers . He went down to their offices to badger them . He cultivated department heads and the administrators of agencies by pushing their pet measures in the House . And with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a friend of his , who wanted to sidetree &; a dangerous prospective opponent by getting him a well-paid job . Tom Jeff 's friend went down to one of the large agencies and told his whole sad story to a sympathetic administrator . The administrator consented to save Tom Jeff 's friend 's skin by setting aside a soft berth for the prospective opponent . Tom Jeff 's friend , satisfied , started for the door . " Oh , by the way , George , " he said , just before he got there , " I would n't let him make any speeches if I were you , He 's a fine fellow , but sometimes he talks sort of wild . " The administrator nodded , and the legislator started doorwards again . Once more he paused . " And another thing , George , I do n't think I 'd let him handle any money either . I 've sort of heard that his sense of what 's his and what 's yours is n't any too well developed . " Praise Wiih a Catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Again the legislator headed for the door , and this time be got clear outside and , shut it . Then he opened it and put his head back in . " And say , George , I guess there 's one last thing maybe I ought to tell you , " the legislator said . " Do n't misunderstand me . This guy 's a nice able fellow , and he 'll be a credit to your outfit if he 's handled right , but if I were you , I just would n't lot him get too near any pretty girls . " " Humph , " grunted the administrator . " As ( Continued on Page 57 ) merou  --  liferou , the Bonehead , the first and only merou any of us had seen  --  was not one of these confirmed home bodies . Certainly he 'd known all the ins and outs of that crevice as though he 'd lived there a long time . The rock ledge outside it was a comfortable ? front porch for him to loll around on , there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an , if I had been a nterou , I could n't have asked for a nicer setup myself . The more we discussed it the more likely it seemed that we 'd find him still in business  --  a year older , a little bigger , hut , we hoped , with arteries and skull no harder . On the twenty-eighth of September , in calm warm water and bright sunshine , four of us went out to look for him . Mr. Mrozowicki and I had our standard harpoons , while Messrs . Courtois and Gilley carried steel-tube spears with detachable heads secured to the shafts by twelve-foot lengths of heavy line . Because I remembered the bottom from the year before  --  somehow , a igoggle fisher acquires the knack of ' finding his way by the bottom unerringly , and rarely uses landmarks  --  I had no difficulty in leading the caravan to the proper territory . And there on his ledge , looking up at us with his horsy eye , lay M erou , the Bonehead , exactly as I 'd first seen him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and mingled with him at once . I could see his whole body , and I believe I could have seragged him then and there . But a meran is not to he taken lightly , and at least two of our number had legitimate scientific reasons for wanting to see such a grand specimen I understand it , your man will make a tine public servant if we gag him , bind him and blindfold him . We 'll take him , on those terms . " By industry , and by his standing as a Democratic representative obedient to the White House , Tom Jeff prospered . In the end , besides his seventy postmasters , he succeeded in scattering 175 appointees elsewhere through the Federal Government . Nine-tenths of them were important cogs in his district organization , and Tom Jeff believes that they had as much to do with his 1936 majority as the President 's , personal popularity or the millions of public money that went into his district . No wonder Tom Jell is likely to be a little restive in the future , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got , now that the President 's reorganization scheme threatens his present job holders . TOM Jeff is a human fellow , fond of the beer and skittles of life , partial to the movies and occasional evenings of loud-laughing , back-slapping partying . And he sometimes wonders if patronage scrabbling is worth all the trouble , Much less sordid and equally satisfying has been his experience in getting something for the folks back home . He really believes that he has had a lot to do with the tens of millions of public money which the New Deal has poured into his district , but he is wrong , For dealing with Tom Jeff and his friends , the agencies who hold the money bags have a little system as beautifully ingenious and infinitely THE SRTURDRY at large . The grand specimen , bow-ever , had legitimate scientific reasons for getting to hell out of there , and he did so with a single caudal flip which took him into the crevice and out of sight . It was apparent that he did n't care for crowds . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own personal fish : and so , with the gesture of a matador ordering his peons from the ring and hoping to God that they wo n't take it seriously , I waved my companions away and prepared myself to settle the thing , man to merou . They swam away twenty yards or so and lay with their faces under water to witness the drama of life and death which an of its felt would shortly unfold . As for myself , I floated with spear couched and knife loosened in its shea th , ready to sink down and deal the lethal blow . He didn't. come out . 1 lay there for a long , long time  --  so long that I studied his old homestead i 11 detail , even noting that the seaweed on his ledge  --  a species of white flower very like the gardenia of dry land  --  had a foot-wide path worn through it by the friction of his belly . He stuck his head out exaelly where I knew he would . I went down , just as I had planned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew back my arm , sighted tilting the spear , uneorked my soul anal  --  smack ! There was a frightful ruction , a brown flash and , , moor , the Bonehead , was gone ! When 1 came to the surraer , I found that the steel shaft of my harpoon was bent two inches out of line . Well , wait till you see the harpoons we 're making for next year ! more workable than the patronageneeounting system of the brilliant Mr. Hurja . In the last four years , each agency , whether PWA , or TPA , CCC , or Resettlement , always asked Tom Jeff for suggestions , and he invariably responded with reams of them . His responses were then filed for further reference and forgotten , arid the agencies allocated their funds pretty much on the basis of need , They kept Tom Jeff radiantly happy , however , by telephoning him the joyful news sometime before aft allocation to his district was to be announced . The PWA used to allow him a mere three hours , which put Tom Jeff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his mind at once to approve the allocation if he wanted to take the credit for what his district got . He was often given a day or so 's notice by less-cunning administrators than Harold Ickes , who needs to be cunning , since his municipal power plants and housing projects have often been controversial issues . Whether Tom Jeff was allowed a few hours or ii few days , the result was the same . He would telegraph the glorious news back to his district , taking all the credit for himself , and the local newspapers would blossom with pleasing headlines , Doc POUND FOR H USTIPUCKENY PROMISED JONES ; JONES GETS RED GULCH BRIDGE , and the like . With the stories friendly editors often printed what Al Smith used to call a baloney picture of Tom Jeff leaving the allocating department or ? 58 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST janssarY e , 1937 agency . The idea was that Tom Jeff was coming out with the swag . Tom Jeff occasionally pestered the men who could give his district something , but he never went quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build a maternity hospital in his native town . Tom Jeff 's colleague swore that the hospital would be both useful and self-liquidating , but on investiga I ion the PWA discovered that if the institution was to pay for itself , every woman over eighteen and under fifty in the congressman 's district would have to produce two and one-half children annually . Pester the administrators though he did on occasion , Tom Jeff was content in the main to stay regular and let the manna fall . Five or six rebellious Democrats who developed the most frightful symptoms of political starvation , or galloping inability to get the district anything , taught Tom Jeff that regularity and obedience to the White House was the course of wisdom . Men whom Tom Jeff secretly envied , however , were the dangerous rebels , the ones the New Dealers felt they must convert , and converted by surfeit . Take the ease of the Virginia congressional delegation . Defiance from Virginia , with its long and glorious Democratic tradition , would have been a serious matter to the New Deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine congressmen were openly unsympathetic at the New Deal 's start . Strangely enough . Federal money began to pour into Virginia at . such a rate the State Chamber of Commerce established a special department to think up new things the Federal Treasury could do for Virginia . Its director was once heard to wail : " Oh , if I could only dig up just twelve unemployed actors in the state . Why , I could get 870.000 for a theater project tomorrow , but I 've combed the state over , and one broken-down Thespian 's all I can find . " When the Rain of Manna Ends In the first . three and one-half years of the New Deal , some $326,000,000 went . into Virginia in loans and grants of different kinds . The happy populace would brook no disapproval of Santa Claus , and eight of the nine Virginia representatives are counted as dependable New Dealers now . More important still , the latent dissent of the State 's two distinguished senators , Carter Glass and Harry F. Byrd , has never bloomed into open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immense sum of money at the President 's disposal has been . While the manna has showered down , congressmen have stayed quiet . Whether or no the result is a new independence of Congress , it will be interesting to watch the reactions of Torn Jeff and his friends when the rain of manna thins to a weak drizzle . As it was at the end of the patronage story , so again the question is ; What will Tom Jeff do ? The congressional leaders have an answer to the question . They think that if Toni Jeff ca n't get something for his district one way , he 'll try it another , and their sleep is already troubled by dreams of blocs  --  visions of horrid witches ' sabbaths , in which farmers , and labor , and Doctor Townsend 's legions of the aged , and women peace advocates , and veterans , and all the other special interests which seek appeasement by legislation bellow their demands , while Tom Jeff promises everything to each of them , and the President wildly brandishes his veto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Tom Jeff is an amiable fellow , very fond of giving everyone , or at least everyone with a vote , exactly what he wants . They know that Tom Jeff 's obsessing aim is to hang onto his job , and they know , too , that Tom Jeff thinks he can hang onto his job forever if he satisfies the important voting interests in his district . His district is neither rural nor urban ; the labor vote is strong , the farm vote is strong , and elderly persons , anxious to end their days on Federal bounty , are as common as veterans of the various wars . You can see that there are a lot of people for Tom . Jeff to satisfy . Because patronage was strengthening his organization ; because public money was pouring into his district , satisfying everyone ; because he has been acutely conscious of the President 's immense personal popularity , Toni Jeff has heeded the President , not the lobbyists , in the last four years . Except for the veterans ' representatives , the lobbyists who swarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket and a list of votes in the other , have been surprisingly ineffective under the New Deal . Rising Above Principle This session , with the patronage run out and the flood of public money dwindling , the leaders expect Tont Jeff and his friends to be terrified of the lobbyists again at the end of four months . Then the blocs will form , with the lobbyists as their guiding minds . Terror is the lobbyists ' weapon with Tom Jeff ; under ordinary circumstances , they can arouse Tom Jeff 's constituents to write and telegraph him in their thousands at the drop of a hat , until Tom Jeff is convinced that he must vote the lobbyists ' way or lose his job . Even if he believes a measure is a bad one , a real whirlwind of telegrams will persuade Toni Jeff that it 's time , as one statesman put it , " to rise above principle and vote for the people . " The leaders are all the more worried because two of the most powerful lobbying groups , labor and the farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power since their demonstration of strength nt the polls in November . The thirty-hour-week bill , bills doubling farm benefits and other measures originating in these two lobbies will be hard to stop , and the leaders know it . With a prescience born of worry , they can imagine Tom Jeff 's first submission to a bloc . They are conscious that the law of self-preservation motivates politicians as well as pigs . They have made a gloomy ealeulat ion of the probable lack of cohesiveness in their huge majority . Already they can hear Toni Jeff 's answer , when they ask him to vote with the President and against the lobbyists . " Boys , just this once , I 've got to save my own skin . There are 334 of us , and if I vote to keep my job just this time , you 've still got 333 others to vote with the President . He wo n't miss me today and , boys , I 'd he kind of glad if you would n't tell um about . it . " No doubt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Tom Jeff is not the same Tom Jeff who heard Representative Clifton A. Woodrum , of Virginia , tell the House Dem-ocrats : " When the Congressional Record lies on the desk of Mr. Roosevelt in the morning , he will look over the roll call , and from that he will know whether or not the members of his own party were willing to go along with him . There is not a Democrat here who does not understand what I mean . " That was during the economy-bill debate back in 1933 , even before Tom Jeff got his hands on the post offices , and the hideous threat made Tom Jeff vote against the veterans ' lobby and his better judgment . It would n't now . Labor arid agriculture are not alone in their power to frighten Tom Jeff . The veterans , who have not quite digested the bonus , are expected to keep quiet , but when the Social Security Act is revamped this session , Toni Jeff will want to increase the law 's immediate pension benefits in his elderly constituents ' favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quotas of telegrams to the blue and yellow piles on Toni Jeff 's desk , and so will many more . Tom Jeff is even likely to find himself voting for lobbies he never heard of , since one of the things lobbyists do best is fix up deals between blocs , on the simple principle , " You vote for my bill and I 'll vote for yours . " For example , the New Deal 's Philippine Independence Bill was whooped through while the liberals cheered . yet a good many legislative bosoms burned with the spirit ? of freedom only because the dairy farmers , who wanted a tariff on Philippine copra and coconut oil , and the beet-sugar people , who hankered to see Philippine cane sugar pay customs duty , had got together . Tom Jeff made one of his best . speeches that time , on " The Spirit of ' 76 . " Dairy farmers are numerous in his district . The Sheep and the Goats In order to keep Torn Jeff regular , the leaders are going to offer him such a Hobson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They plan to tell him , " Stay with us or stay at home . There are plenty of others here like you , and if you are n't regular , you 're just another Republican as far as we 're concerned . " The fact is , the leaders will try to fight blocs with a blocs In mid-November they began canvassing the long list of House Democrats , culling it . over for the makings of an administration bloc of about 250 members . They hope that if they divide their majority into a manageable herd of 250 sheep and a hand of eighty-four goats , they can maintain the President 's authority . The patronage and pickings  --  what little is left of them  --  will all be the sheep 's , and the sheep will be lectured daily on party responsibility . The goats will get tin cans and promises of opposition in the 1938 primaries . Tom Jeff does n't know now , and wo n't know until the moment of choice , whether he is to be a sheep or a goat . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derision , depends the whole suecees of the leaders ' strategy . If the strategy succeeds , a tall , modest , highly intelligent young man from Ohio , with large ears and a pleasant manner , will have proved himself the greatest lobbyist in the history of the United States . He is , by title , Under Secretary of the Interior . His name is Charles West , and he used to expound the theory of government as an instructor in the subject at Harvard . His former students might be mildly surprised to see him putting the theory into very realistic practice as the White House lobbyist on Capitol Hill . West is one of the most remarkable illustrations of the President 's ability to pick the right man for the right job . A former congressman himself , he knows just how to deal with members . He knows which leader likes to he made to feel that some bill entirely written by a brain truster is his on-rill wonderful invention ; which leader needs a daily pat on the back ; and which one needs a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the leaders , but when they get into trouble , he goes to the individual members with whom he is immensely popular . More congressmen have poured their troubles into those large , receptive ears of his than into any other ears in Washington . Backfiring Oratory Moreover , West knows his way about as well as the leaders themselves in the labyrinth of rules and precedents which govern the House 's procedure , At his regular post . in the Speaker's4 office , he is always ready to confer with them on how a bill should be speeded up , slowed down , passed , stepped on or condemned to a lingering death in committee . Any bill , whether West brings it up from the White House or Tom Jeff introduces it to indemnify a constituent whose brow has been scarred by ice falling from the post-office roof , has a difficult road to travel . It must go to the committee , be approved there , come up on the floor and be voted on . The leaders can use their influence and the House rules to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebellion of the Toni Jeffs can take their power from them . West and the leaders are counting heavily on the rules as another weapon against bloc action . One last thing the leaders count one to help them in their dealings with Toni Jeff . Before he came to Congress , Torn Jeff was a rather obscure lawyer of political leanings , and before 1932 his greatest triumph at the polls was when he got the job of district attorney for one term . " Since 1932 he has been so busy running errands for the folks back home that he has not learned his job thoroughly . The leaders know their jobs and Tom Jeff 's job , too , which gives them a distinct advantage . In their long calculations of what Toni Jeff will do to hang on to his job , the leaders keep harking bark to an incident of the sales-tax fight of 1932 . Then the real legislative concern of the Tom Jeffs in the House was exquisitely illustrated , even before Tom Jeff himself became a solon . Vice President Garner , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , to balance the4 budget , and so did other Democratic leaders . The sales tax was decided on . Some Republicans , some Democrats , like Bob Doughton , the Progressives , like Fiorello La Guardia , were bitterly opposed to the measure . But the leadership rounded up a sizable favorable majority of Tom Jeffs . The bill was set to pass until Representative Charles R. Crisp , an able but emotional Georgian statesman , ended a strong speech for it by beating his breast and shouting that although his vote for the sales tax might defeat him in the next election , he loved his country well enough to sacrifice his job . While the House cheered , Representative Loring Black , of New York , another supporter of the pleasure , stamped angrily out of the chamber with the verdict : " The bill 's licked , now he 's told them it might lick them . " And so it was ,
