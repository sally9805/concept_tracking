In 1922 the late Samuel Lionel ( " Roxy " ) Rothafel began a weekly broadcast called " Roxy and His Gang . " Purpose was to promote the Capitol Theatre , huge Manhattan cinemansion of which Major Edward Bowes was part owner . In 1925 , Rothafel left the Capitol to direct the new , plush-lined Roxy Theatre , took his " Gang " idea with him . The Capitol 's program continued as " Major Bowes 's Capitol Theatre Family , " with Bowes acting as an unctuously friendly master of ceremonies in the Roxy manner . In 1934 , a veteran at the microphone , Major Bowes began an " Amateur Hour " over New York 's small Station WHN . Last year , after Roxy had failed on a spectacular scale to make a go of Radio City 's gigantic Music Hall , Major Bowes 's hour had become Radio 's No. 1 commercial broadcast , worth $7,500 a week to Standard Brands to advertise Chase &; Sanborn 's Coffee over 60 National Broadcasting Co. stations . Last week , when it was announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chrysler , would pay him a reputed $15,000 a week for program rights alone , Major Bowes graduated clear out of show business , was a big business in himself . <P> Contrary to the opinion of many an interested adman who thought that Radio 's top attraction had thus successfully culminated a campaign for a merited raise , Major Bowes blandly announced : <P> " Major Bowes 's relations with his present sponsor are of the happiest . There has never been a single instance to mar a completely harmonious association ; nor has there ever been any discussion whatever as to compensation . Major Bowes and Walter P. Chrysler are old and intimate friends , and Major Bowes has such admiration for the man and his achievements that to represent him and his products on the radio will take on an added pleasure and satisfaction . " <P> If Major Bowes should care to incorporate , the books of Bowes Inc. would show by September a weekly gross of some $30,000 . For the famed Bowes gong now reverberates far beyond his radio audience , in a half-dozen lucrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorated with pictures of cat &; dog amateurs ; Major Bowes cotton fabrics , also decorated with amateurs ; the Major Bowes alarm clock which rouses sluggards with a gong ; the 25 Major Bowes ' Amateur Magazine ; the weekly Amateur Writers Page in Bernarr MacFadden 's Liberty ; a parchesi-like Major Bowes Game ; two monthly movie shorts ; and 14 traveling shows or " units ' of amateurs who have appeared on the radio program , playing theatres all over the U. S. Over head of Bowes Inc. would include $5 weekly to 14 or 15 amateurs , $10 to those who " get the gong " ( are hustled off the air when Bowes rings a bell ) , salaries of 35 personal employes , and $40 to $60 weekly , plus transportation , to the unit members .
