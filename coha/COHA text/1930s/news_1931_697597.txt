txt VOLUME VS . STYLE IN SINGING To the Editor of The New York Times : I notice that you always have a harsh word for Mr. Lauri-Volpi 's singing , condemning him for using loud voice on his high notes . It might enlighten you to turn to the reviews of the late Enrico Caruso for the years 1906-1910 , where you will discover that he was spoken of with almost the same words you use about Mr. Lauri-Volpi . You might further consider that a large part of the music lovers who attend Metropolitan performances do not have the reviewer 's privileges of seats near the stage , and that they like to know that the tenor really has a voice . If you will sit in the upper regions of the Metropoli- , tan  --  where most of the really appreciative operagoers have to sit or stand  --  you will be grateful to Mr. Lauri-Volpi for giving up enough voice to reach the balconies . Probably you prefer more of what you choose to call " style " in your singing . But you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is used to mask the incapacity of the singer or to supplement the vocal gifts of nature . If you like the style of Trantoul , take it ; but give the poor dumb operagoer who pays for his tickets a little more of Lauri-Volpi 's voice and less of Trantoul 's " style . " CLEM WAGNER . Brooklyn , Jan. 21 , 1931 . CONDUCTORS AND PROGRAMS . To the Editor of The New York Times : Why does a conductor not take into account what other conductors have played or what he himself has played ? At his last visit Serge Koussevitzky played Stravinsky 's new " Capriccio , " but not the Prokofieff symphony he had first announced . Now , for his next visit , he announces the " Capriccio " a second time , instead of letting us hear the Prokofieff at least once . He also announces Strauss 's " Sin- fonia Domestica " and Sibelius 's Seventh symphony ( though he has played these works here and has not played others by the same composers ) . Giving so few concerts in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be grasped at first hearing , so that we may hear as many as possible of the interesting works that he plays in Boston . If anything , then , he should repeat the Sibelius symphony , which is rarely heard and not easily grasped . Instead , he announces one performance of this work , and two of the Strauss , which is well known and not difficult ! A SUBSCRIBER . New York , Jan. 27 , 1931 . PRAISE FOR THE SOCIETY OF THE FRIENDS OF MUSIC To the Editor of The New York Times : Few and far between are the recessions in this seething metropolis whither one can retreat into their grace for inspiration , and one of them is the Society of the Friends of Music . In their unremitting quest for the unexploited esthetic values in music , coupled with the feeling of reverence for genius that reposes in oblivion , the society , under the masterly direction and erudition of Artur Bodanzky , brings to life and light musical creations which perhaps fate herself had hoped and waited for liberation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those who unassumingly crave for the things that endure and for art of the highest order . A cause that lays claim to sacrifice , love and devotion and imbues one with its spirit to be willing and ready to offer them must be nothing short of ideal . ADAM A. SANDERS .
