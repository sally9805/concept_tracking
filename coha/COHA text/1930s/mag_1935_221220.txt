In an industry to which personal vanity , professional jealousy and creative carte blanche are as indispensable as they are to the cinema , upheavals in personnel are naturally more sudden , more dramatic , and more painful than elsewhere . Hollywood long ago chose " amicable settlement " as an apt phrase to describe the results , whatever these may be , of all such events . Two months ago when Producers Darryl Zanuck and Joseph Schenck took their lively Twentieth Century Pictures away from United Artists to merge with Fox , where Winfield Sheehan has been vice president in charge of production since 1926 , it was immediately clear that an amicable settlement of major proportions was at hand . Last week it arrived . After chats with Producer Schenck and Fox President Sidney Kent , Winfield Sheehan announced that he had tendered his resignation . Said Mr. Kent : " . . . It was accepted with regret . I and the corporation extend our best wishes to Mr. Sheehan . . . . This matter has been settled amicably . . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no plans except a holiday abroad . <P> Born in 1883 , a onetime New York World reporter who got into the cinema business in 1914 , Producer Sheehan was right-hand man to William Fox when that ambitious onetime garment worker was building up his topheavy theatre chain . When Fox was ousted , fat , jolly Producer Sheehan remained , on such good terms with Mr. Fox 's enemies that , instead of losing his job as the studio 's production head , he held it through two reorganizations . In 1932 , when he had the nervous breakdown which is often another Hollywood euphemism for an ousting , it looked as if Producer Sheehan might be through . Instead , though his importance in Fox was somewhat lessened by the introduction of outside producers like Sol Wurtzel and Jesse Lasky , he continued in power , made such successes as Cavalcade and State Fair . <P> That last week 's settlement might really have been amicable was indicated by the terms revealed . Producer Sheehan kept his fat block of Fox stock , got something like $360,000 for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new regime at Fox-henceforth to be called Twentieth Century-Fox-Producer Zanuck will have Producer Sheehan 's old job as Production Chief , direct studio operations under the nominal control of President Kent .
