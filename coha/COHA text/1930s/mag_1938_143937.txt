More than seven years ago , sardonic , leather-faced John Erskine , then president of Manhattan 's opulent Juilliard School of Music , remarked that he saw no future in opera " as it is imported from Europe and produced . . . in the big American opera houses . " Mr. Erskine craved librettos that could be heard " without the listener losing his self-respect . " <P> Of the five operas by U. S. composers since presented in the cozy , elegant Concert Hall of the Juilliard School , three have had librettos by ex-President Erskine . The first , Jack &; the Beanstalk ( music by Louis Gruenberg , composer of the opera Emperor Jones ) , was light , agreeable , vaudevillian ( TIME , Nov. 30 , 1931 ) . The second , Helen Retires ( music by George Antheil , Dadaist enfant terrible ) . was based on Erskine 's smart novel The Private Life of Helen of Troy , had surrealist scenery and freakish , hit-or-miss orchestration ( TIME , March 12 , 1934 ) . <P> Last week a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premiere of Erskine 's third libretto . Like its predecessors , The Sleeping Beauty was a sophisticated , faintly boudoirish version of a well-known legend . Its Prince Charming was slightly discouraged by the princess ' somniloquent references to a previous boy friend , but the discouragement was temporary . The music , by Cleveland Institute of Music 's Director Beryl Rubinstein , sounded like a protracted anthology of French Impressionism . In the few moments when it was not dull it echoed the libretto 's mood of gentle irony . Said gently ironic Critic Oscar Thompson ( New York Sun ) : " The subject of the new opera was not of itself one to promise an exciting evening and Mr. Rubinstein 's score was never false to its subject .
