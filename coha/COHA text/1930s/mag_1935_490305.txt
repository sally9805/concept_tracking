COLLEGIATE NOTES of an Informative Nature : Jane Seymour , a freshman at Hunter , is a descendant of the brother of the third wife of Henry VIII . One of the members of the Cornell varsity polo team is a i , irl named Nathalie . MELLIFLUOUS NOTE : There 's a millinery shop in Times Square which goes by the- easily verified name of Grace &; Merit . the many parishioners who sent us holiday greetings we send thanks and greetings . Two odd little incidents occurred . A lady in Toledo sent us a typewritten greeting which we mistook for a manuscript and re-jected with our usual promptness and severity . With amazing amiability she mailed it right hack ; for when a woman wishes us well , nothing can stop her . Another reader , of the opposite temper , submitted for publication a greeting which he had sent to his friends . Everybody had told him it was good enough to print in The New Yarker . He said we could publish it provided we used his name . All in all a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known in some time . IT is impossible to resist or explain the subtle change in the public sentiment toward Bruno Hauptmann . When he was arrested , charged with the crime , the strong assumption was that he was guilty and a wave of hate hung over him for days . Months have elapsed , as they always do in criminal cases in this country , where the microphone bids fairto supplant the scales in the hand of Justice . Mr. Hauptmann has appeared many times before us  --  reunited with wife and baby , analyzed by feature writer , pictured as a mystery man of iron will , shunned only by carol singers . Gradually he becomes , in a backhanded way , a kind of innocuous celebrity  --  like any third-rate novelist or six-day hike rider  --  tinged , of course , with a faint note of impurity but almost completely rid of that fierce blame which first encompassed him as the possessor of the ransom hills . Justice seems to run to extremes : either we lynch a Negro in the bloody passion of the moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long period that he comes to trial wearing a white veil like a bride . WE got out our stocking cap and our ringing steel the other evening and went skating at the corner of Sixty-first and Park Avenue , where somebody has flooded the tennis courts by arrangement with Jack Frost . The night was clear and kindly , and we even played a little hockey , with some Park Avenue scrubs . It seemed a queer place to he on skates , that corner , among the fine towers , beside the still waters . A premonitory coldness descended upon the block , and for an instant we beheld in a vision the next ice age  --  all buildings gone , all corners flooded and frozen . But we recovered and stayed late , gliding gracefully about beneath the calm gaze of the stars and the doorman at No. 47 East . THE new streamlined cab is a com- plete sellout to the chicanery of design . Holiday traffic crawled at two miles an hour . The only thing that needed streamlining was the meter , so that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meek ninnies we are , the whole hunch of us , letting our crowns be bruised by a lot of crackpot engineers crazed with the notion that we are presenting too great a resistance to the wind ! The next thing they will streamline will he the Avenue buses , which sometimes take two clays getting from Best 's to the thorn hushes in front of the Library . ABANKER 'S wife , despite the badgered , harassed time she must he having of it , has taken a moment to sit down and write us a note about Dean 's . Dean 's , it seems , has " arranged with the authorities " that southbound cars , between the hours of 10 A.M. and 5 P.M. , may make a left turn from Fifth Avenue into Fifty-seventh Street . Dean 's has managed this for the convenience of its customers , and if any traffic officer tries to stop you , you are to report him . It certainly shows that industry is vitally interested in leftist movements , although still envisaging a world which travels only by car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fifth Avenue . TT is obvious what the thief who stole 1 . the lightning-rod tips from the top of the Washington Monument has in mind . He is going to use them to chop down a cherry tree . Two Volumes DR . DAME has been back in Canada for some rime now , but we feel it is n't too late to tell of a little incident of his last day here , a happening in his room at the Ritz-Carlton . The Doctor was having breakfast  --  or trying to ; quite a few people were in the room , and more kept knocking on the door or ringing on the telephone . The Doctor had to get up to accept two chamois penguins designed by Walt Disney , a gift from Lord &; Taylor . No sooner had he sat down than he was on his feet again to receive two large volumes brought by a messenger. ? ? These , it came out , were a learned treatise on obstetrics , and they were accompanied by a polite and respectful little note from the author himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dafoe glanced through the pages of first one volume and then the other , pausing every now and then to go back over a paragraph . Finally he put the volumes down on a table . " Too deep for me , " he said . Little Red Hats restless search for clean enter- tainment took us into the big eighth-floor studio at Radio City last Tuesday night , to see Ed Wynn broadcast his Texaco program over the N.B.C . network . The place was already filled when we got there at nine-fifteen ; some fifteen hundred pun-lovers were sitting on small , uncomfortable-looking chairs , holding their overcoats and hats in their laps . The nearest we can come to describing them is to say that they looked like fifteen hundred of the people who listen to Mr. Wynn on the radio . Everybody got a little red Fire Chief hat , and nobody knew what to do with it . We finally dropped ours on the floor , like a coward . Must people just put theirs on top of their hats and overcoats in their laps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Louis Witten , came out and assured the audience , in the pure tones of professional elocution , that silence was not necessary to the broadcast . We could laugh our heads off , he said . Everybody coughed . The man next to us moved his legs convulsively and upset an empty chair in front of him . Eddy Duchin 's hand , wearing red jackets , came in , and after them Graham McNamee and Ed Wynn . The siren and bell sounded . We were on the air ! From then on , things were more familiar , naturally ; you could close your eyes and imagine you were home , trying to play bridge . The only thing we remember about this particular program is that Ed Wynn said his uncle always went to costume parties as a harlequin . " After two drinks , he harlequin stand up , " he explained . " TV hat ? " said a lady sitting near us . " He said , " her husband told her in a vicious undertone , " that after two drinks he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " doubtfully . Mr. Witten had warned us not to leave when the broadcast was over , so we stayed , Everybody stayed , and Ed came hack and talked to us informally for half an hour . He called Graham McNamee and Eddy Duchin back , too , and paid . them both some handsome compliments . We remember particularly what he said about Eddy : " This boy is a genius , and he do n't know it . If lie would only sacrifice all the great things in life and lock himself in a room , he would he a great genius . " Eddy blinked , probably considering the price of genius . We kept hoping that the Wynn gag-man would he introduced , too , but he was n't . Ed assured us that he was and always would be a stickler for wholesomeness and cleanliness , and took occasion to repeat Mr. Brisbane 's advice about not selling America short . He really did ; we do n't make up anything in this department . Then he and Eddy Duchin played a piano duet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow found their way to people who seemed to have a use for them . Some carried sheaves of six or seven . If you want to know what made the biggest impression on us , it was the reverent silence that prevailed in the studio during the commercial plug . The message about Texaco gasoline commanded a sort of reverence-plus , far more impressive than anything we ever saw in a church . Catastrophe WE have learned already of one sad mishap to mar the holiday season . After a small but festive dinner at which most of the guests were folk home from school , various of the gentlemen present did parlor tricks . The young man of the house topped them all by digging into a bowl of walnuts and slamming them , one by one , against a window of the living-room . The point was that the walnuts always smashed to bits , the window never . There was n't any deception about it , either  --  the guests were allowed to try it themselves . Everybody was fascinated , particularly the lad who is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( it broke up rather early , because they ran out of walnuts and everything seemed anticlimactic after that ) , this young man hurried home . Luck was with him ; his father and mother and two sisters were still up . Not even waiting to take off his topcoat , he went to a Christmas nut bowl , snatched up a walnut , and hurled it against the window . There was a Erie crash : the window this time . His family just looked at him , while the pieces of glass tinkled on the pavement below , and he just looked at them . Then , bowed by the complete hopelessness of everything , he turned and went to his room . He spoke very little to his family for the next several days . The man who told us about this says that before you try the trick , you must be sure your walnuts are of the thin-shelled variety and well dried ; also that the window is big enough to have a little elasticity . The young man evidently got hold of a thick-hulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window was too small . Our own earnest advice is to ignore the whole thing . We ca n't even he sure the stor ? has n't been cooked up to get trusting people to smash windows all over wwn . Bad Samaritam A BRISK young business woman A 1 named Florence left a gay holiday party around midnight , being bored , and set out for home . The house she went away from is over in Chelsea , not . far from where Clement Moore wrote " ' T was the Night Before Christmas , " but the region has changed for the worse since those placid days , and our young woman found herself walking south on Ninth Avenue a little frightened and quite cold . She discovered that she had only four cents in her purse and would have to walk home  --  or the go back to the party and wait for the young man who took her there . She had left him singing " Sweet Nri ( ilets , Sweeter Than All the Roses " and apparently not ever wanting to go home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eighteenth Street two men stepped out of the shadows and accosted her . They looked like thugs ; in fact , they were thugs . One grabbed her arm and the other took hold of her handbag . " Come ahn , give it up , lady , " said the latter . Her heart was heating fast and her throat was dry , but she managed to gasp that she had oily four cents  --  otherwise , she said , she 'd be in a taxicab . They let her empty her handbag and prove that what she said was true : she had just four cents , a cigarette-lighter , some keys , and papers . One of the men took the lighter , but they let her put all the other things back in the hag , including the four cents . " Where you live , lady asked one of the men . She said Bedford Street . " Well , " the man said , " you ought n't to be welkin ' home alone all the way down there . Ai n't dat right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few minutes more of chiding her for being so foolish as to walk along Ninth Avenue alone after midnight , one of the holdup men said that they 'd see her home . They did , too , one walking on either side of her . The trio talked about the hard times , the last Chicago Bears-New York Giants professional football game , etc. , until they reached Bedford Street . There , on the corner , she left them . They did n't how , but they said , " So long , lady , " and they tipped their hats , or touched their fingers to them anyway . They kept her lighter . Retreat THE Hotel Sherwood of Newark , O. , pop . 30,596 , has yielded before the generosity of its patrons but is still trying to mitigate their munificence . So writes a friendly world traveller , enclosing a card reading as follows , which he found under the glass top of the table in his room there : Our " No Tipping " experiment has been a failure . You may tip or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will receive will be the Mine in either case . If it is n't please let us know . If you really desire to tip why not give a nickel ? Japanese Handy Man numPEt Lista has satisfied a lifetime ambition ; he has sold one of his paintings . This unprecedented event occurred in November during the John Wanamaker store exhibition . The purchaser was a woman doctor named Sara A. Bonnett , who paid him two hundred dollars for an interior titled simply " Painting . " Some of the critics thought he should have had one of the three prizes . The success of Mr. Usui has caused wide alarm among other painters , because if a real demand for his pictures develops , he will have no time to frame the work of his co-practitioners on tick . He is one of the busiest picture-framers in the city now , being especially patronized by the very rich and the very poor , who seem to appreciate cheapness about equally . He will not charge even Mrs. John D. Rockefeller , Jr. , more than fifty dollars for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his colleagues , framing several pictures and keeping one . He 'll do this only for painters whose work he admires , though , preferring to let the others owe him the money if they 're broke . It 's no wonder he has too much work and too many unpaid bills in his atelier , at 5 East Fourteenth Street . But he is a resourceful man ; he raises Siamese cats to help offset the deficit . The name is pronounced " Boom-pay Oo-soo-ay , " and it 's an old one in Nagano , the Japanese silk centre . Bumpei was born there in 1898 , into a silk-producing family . Winters , as a boy , he used to go to school , and in the summer he 'd pick mulberry leaves for the silkworms . Tiring of that , he went to England in 1917 and joined an older brother , who was buying Occidental pictures . In three years in London he picked up English and learned the secrets of Queen Anne lacquering , which , he believes , are known to no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a Fifth Avenue shop window , a grandfather 's clock he had done in England . It was marked " Original , " and this made him proud . Iri 1929 he was painting some furniture for a lady on Seventy-ninth Street , and she showed him another clock he recognized as an early Usui . She said it was a beautiful old thing . " No , " said Bumpei , who explains that he did not wish to praise his own work . To prove his point , he took an icepick and removed several buckshot from the wormholes . He got no more work in that house . He came here in 1921 , " fool around for a year , " and then set up in the lacquering line , working for decorators . This petered out about 1927 , and he did such things as striping automobiles until , in 1929 , his friend and countryman Kuniyoshi asked him to try some framing for him . Bumpei , " born with clever hand , " pleased him exceedingly . His career as a framer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to fit the frame not only to the picture but to the room in which it is to hang . For instance , he 's designing a frame now for a still-life of fruits and a scarf , owned by Mrs. Rockefeller . It 's to hang in a modern room designed by Donald Deskcy . The walls are off-shade white with black trim , and the adjoining bathroom has a black built-in tub and bright chromium fixtures . The frame will he strictly modern , with silver as the featured color . An ordinary artisan would n't think of taking the bathroom fixtures into account . Usui lives on Ninth Street with his wife , a Kansas City girl . Here he keeps his cats . He sells fifteen cats at fifty dollars each during a fair year . Because of his custom of accepting canvases as remuneration for work , he has an extensive collection of moderns . Even so , when he sells a cat , he may-sally into the marts and plunk down cash for another picture he likes . Ile 's painted since his London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his hoods . He flails the water with a branch until " the fish get excited " and hide under a rock . Then he reaches in and gets them . Fish do n't see you , apparently , when " excited . " He always puts the trout back , because he 's been told it 's against the law to catch one unless you offer him a small colored feather to eat . Music Box AN American engineer told a little group the other evening of something that happened last summer in Spain , where he went to take charge of a road-building project . The natives had little interest in the job and a rather impractical attitude toward any kind of work , it seemed , and things went distressingly slow . He hopefully looked forward to the arrival of an American concrete-mixer to catch up with the construction schedule . It finally arrived , and was assembled and tet in operation , but its first effect was the opposite of what he had hoped . The moment it started , the native laborers all threw down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite deliriously . Highest Office SOMEBODY ( we suspect a Chry- sler man ) wrote us anonymously the other day and asked , " Do you realize that the highest occupied office in town is n't in the Empire State Building ? " He granted that the Empire State contained the highest unoccupied offices , but claimed that the highest occupied were no higher than those in several other buildings he could name . We at once went out to check up and , as we suspected , found that our correspondent was wrong . It 's true that the Empire State directory lists no tenants between the forty-first and eightieth floors , but on the eighty-fifth is the highest occupied office in town . The tenant is the National Broadcasting Company and it has had a short-wave research laboratory there , 1,060 feet above the street , since shortly after the building was opened . Not only is it the highest laboratory pretty exclusive : strictly no visitors allowed . Since it occupies half the floor and the other half is untenanted , the eighty-fifth floor is closed to everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laboratory . Mr. Brown , the manager of the building , who knows us of old , supplied a few facts , though . It takes the N.B.C . researchers about a minute and a quarter ( time actually in motion ) to ascend to their office : fifty-five seconds on the express to the eightieth floor , and twenty seconds on the car from the eightieth to the eighty-fifth . ( Falling down would take a trifle over eight seconds . ) The eighty-fifth is the highest rentable floor in the building , just under the first observation platform . It seems the N.B.C . had to get the highest quarters available , as the short waves disappear at the horizon and they like to see them as long as they can . That 's the way Mr. Brown put it . The second highest office in the Empire State , and in town , is Raskob 's and Pierre S. du Pont 's on the eightieth floor , one thousand feet up . Mr. Raskob has six rooms , Mr. du Pont three . We got a peek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a beautiful Persian rug on the floor , an oil of the twelve kaskob children which covers most of one wall , and a brass cuspidor with a rubber mat behind the desk . Neither Mr. Raskoh nor Mr. du Pont was in the suite the day we were there  --  the latter , in fact , being at the investigation in Washington  --  and it was a lonesome place , with heavy rain and mist without . You could n't see a thine- . " We 're above the clouds today , " our guide told us . " It happens about three times a week this weather . " We found out one other thing about the Empire State that 's been worrying us : whether the nightly lighting of the unoccupied upper floors is merely for advertising . Turns out to he primarily an aesthetic matter . One night one of the architects of the building hap pened to look up at it and gave a cry of horror . The brilliantly lighted mooring mast had a terrifying aspect  --  as though it were perched in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called up the building and told them what a shock he 'd had .

Brotherly AMOTHER who , with one of her daughters , sat in a rear pew of the First Presbyterian Church last Sunday morning reports that she was considerably interested in the behavior of two of the deacons who took up the collection . After they 'd finished , she says , they were standing side by side at the rear of the centre aisle , holding their laden plates in front of them , all ready to begin their march to the altar , when suddenly one of them , who seemed to have got better results from his collecting than the other , generously dipped his hand into his gatherings , took out a heap of hills and change , and transferred them to his companion 's plate . Then , with the equalized burdens , they set off down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
