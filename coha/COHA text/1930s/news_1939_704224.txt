txt President 's Stand Criticized His Arguments for Repeal of Embargo Are Called Inconclusive To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In going before Congress to urge repeal of the arms embargo , the President undertook an unaccustomed role for him , that of opponent of legal change , of champion of ancient wont and use . The novelty of the part perhaps accounts for his rather unsatisfying performance of it . Mr. Roosevelt asserts in his opening sentence that the embargo " impairs the peaceful relations of the United States with foreign nations " ; and he later adds his " deep and unalterable conviction ? * that by the repeal of the embargo the United States will more probably remain at peace than if the law remains as it stands today . " In support of neither assertion nor conviction , however , does he adduce any proof of either factual or logical nature , except a reference to " years of experience as a worker in international peace , " most of which must have antedated his original approval of the embargo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the embargo provision sets up between completed implements of war and the materials out of which they are made an " artificial " one , and he challenges " those who seek to retain the present embargo position " to " be wholly consistent and seek legislation to cut off cloth and copper and meat and wheat and a thousand other articles from all of the nations at war . " Consistency Questioned But obviously the fact that this distinction is " artificial " would not necessarily make it a source of danger to our relations with other countries , while the appeal to consistency is an argument which can be worked both ways . Mr. Roosevelt himself would have to admit that it is " artificial " to distinguish between one who makes a gun and puts it into the hands of another in the certain knowledge that it will be used by that other against a third person , and on the other hand one who fires a gun himself at said third person . Yet this is precisely the distinction on which neutral status pivots . Would Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance ? The fact is , of course , that most legal distinctions are artificial , otherwise the law would not have had to intervene to set them up . And the distinction which the President attacks is derived from the very international law which he so much praises , and to which he is so anxious to return . What is more , he himself adopts it at the end , when he urges the retention of the present " license system covering import and export of arms , ammunition and implements of war , " and the present ben on the shipment of these to belligerent countries on American vessels . Of the latter he says , " This provision should not he disturbed . " The Jefferson " Parallel " Mr. Roosevelt also endeavors to bolster his case by an appeal to history . He seeks to affix to the present embargo the odium which Jefferson 's embargo incurred some 130 years ago . Referring to our struggle to keep out of the Napoleonic Wars , he says : " We acted for some years under the so-called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a disastrous failure  --  first , because it brought our own nation close to ruin , and second , because it was the major cause of bringing us into active participation in European wars in our own War of 1812 . It is merely reciting history to recall to you that one of the results of the policy of embargo and nonintercourse was the burning in 1814 of part of this Capitol in which we are assembled . " Coming from the present leader of the Democratic party , this attack on the principal and most obstinately persisted in policy of the party 's founder seems an argument of desperation . At least , it will come as news to most students of American history that Jefferson 's embargo brought on the War of 1812 ! Another argument the President phrased thus : " From a purely material point of view , what is the advantage to us in sending all manner of articles across the ocean for final processing there , when we could give employment to thousands by doing it here ? Incidentally , and again from the material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own national defense . " Argument Is Criticized The argument is both irrelevant to the main issue and unconvincing in itself . The Congress has recently appropriated some billions of dollars toward this country 's rearmament . Is their expenditure to be postponed in order that we may supply the warring European countries with arms , or are the two things to proceed concomitantly ? If the latter , we shall have on our hands at the end of hostilities a vastly overdeveloped munitions industry just as we did at the end of the World War , and a second economic collapse of more or less serious character . It is true that this danger would he somewhat mitigated by adoption of the cash-and-carry plan , although that is entirely without sanction from international law . Finally , the President advances the following argument : " Repeal of the embargo and a return to international law are the crux of this issue . The enactment of the embargo provisions did more than merely reverse our traditional policy . It had the effect of putting land powers on the same footing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned . A land power which threatened war could thus feel assured in advance that any prospective sea-power antagonist would be weakened through denial of its ancient right to buy anything anywhere . " This , four years ago , gave a definite advantage to one belligerent as against another , not through his own strength or geographic position , but through an affirmative act of ours . Removal of the embargo is merely reverting to the sounder international practice , and pursuing in time of war as in the time of peace our ordinary trade policies . This will be liked by some and disliked by other. , depending on the view they take of the present war , but that is not the issue . The step I recommend is to put this country back on the solid footing of real and traditional neutrality . " There is some confusion of statement , possibly of thought , here . " Four years ago , " when the embargo was enacted , there were no belligerents ; it was a period of peace , at any rate as respects the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can it be conceded , then , that the United States is not free to revise its trade policies in time of peace , whatever the repercussions may be upon the opposed interests of future belligerents ? Certainly no auch concession can be made unless international law requires it . The fact is that the foregoing argument rests on a mistaken assumption ? namely , that neutrals are under a positive obligation to trade with belligerents . The international law to which the President constantly appeals knows no such rule . That law merely permits neutrals to trade with belligerents , subject to the hazards to which the rules concerning contraband and blockade give rise ; it no more requires neutrals to sell to belligerents than it requires them to produce for belligerents . The President 's argument subjects neutral interests to an utterly unheard of servitude in favor of belligerents , and at the same time quite gratuitously presents the naval powers with a grievance made up out of whole cloth . There may be plenty of sound arguments for the repeal of the arms embargo . If so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The address to Congress does not make out a case for its main proposal and shows ; a disturbing lack of clarity on the part of the Administration as to its own guiding intention . EDWARD S. CORWIN . Princeton , N. J. , Sept. 29 , 1939 . Hitler and the Germans Mr. Krock 's View of His Domination Is Upheld Against . Disputant To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : From factual , psychological , political and historical viewpoints the view . of Erwin H. Klaus expressed In his letter to THE TIMES are wrong and Mr. Krock is right . I am ; German-born myself . I am a scientist in politics , culture and education . I have been an editor and an educator in Germany as I am an Author and an educator in this country . I know a good part of the world and have enough distance and objectivity not to be blinded by hatred or wishful thinking . However , I believe that Hitler is the supreme expression of Prussia.nism . Prussia has always ruled Germany and imposed upon that country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become general for Germany . There is no doubt in my mind that Hitler has behind him a vast if not overwhelming majority . This majority you could already watch growing in the elections before Hitler came to power . Maybe it diminished a little during the beginning of his rule , but it certainly increased again after his successes in annexing Austria , Czecho-Slovakia aftd Memel . Although they are opposed to war  --  because the horrors of the World War are still alive ? there is no doubt that Hitler 's ideas have been infiltrated successfully into the German people . Every nation has the government it deserves . That holds good for Germany too . They found their idol in Hitler because Hitler personifies their nebulous dreaming for world domination as originated from their eternal inferiority complexes . I know the Germans very well indeed and I have found again and again in their minds Hitlerist trends ? already in the time of the first and the second Reich . Make no mistake about it . Hitler is Germany 's majority . To base any policy on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nazism alone would not he sufficient to secure lasting peace . Something else must he done  --  a century of education for democracy . For the German people had never before time and opportunity to study and get acquainted with this form of life . It is the eternal guilt of the Allies not to have helped the Weimar Republic for reaching this goal . KURT L. LONDON . New York , Sept. 29 , 1939 . Two Opinions of a Peace Plea . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I sincerely hope all of your readers will see the letter " Appeal for a Just Peace " by John D. Moore . It is one of the best letters I have read on the present war situation . It is about time people realize that France and England are not absolutely blameless in the present crisis . Mrs. F. G.

It was chiefly President Wilson who re-created Poland and gave her Danzig and an outlet to the sea .

To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The city seems determined to demolish the Ninth Avenue elevated . My only plea for the preservation is based on sentiment . The Bible says : " Remove not the ancient landmarks .
