Japanese aviation interests , which have long tried to extend airlines into China , last week had something to fume about . They learned that Juan Terry Trippe , whose Pan-American Airways Inc. contracts to deliver mail in 31 Central and South American countries and in Alaska . had bought into the Chinese airways monopoly . For years Juan Trippe 's ambition has been to run every major U. S. air service operating outside the U. S. He now does . From North American Aviation . Inc. , which is merging with General Aviation Corp . ( TIME . March 27 ) . Pan-American had acquired , by exchange of stock , the two-year-old China Airways Federal . Inc . It was the last important extra-U . S. aviation interest outside the Pan-American system . <P> China Airways Federal owns 45% of China National Aviation Corp .. whose planes and personnel come from the U. S. The Chinese Nationalist Government owns the rest . China National runs a daily service between Shanghai , Nanking and Hankow ( 567 mi . ) . Twice weekly its planes carry on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world 's grandest scenery-to Chungking . The line also operates thrice-weekly between Shanghai and Peiping ( 790 mi . ) . If &; when Pan-American reaches across the Pacific ( or around it . via Alaska ) , the franchise between Shanghai and Hongkong , 630 mi. from Manila , will be valuable . <P> To U. S. nationals in the Far East , the line which their countrymen operate is a source of gratification . It is one of the few enterprises in China in which the U. S .. China 's good but gullible friend , really leads .
