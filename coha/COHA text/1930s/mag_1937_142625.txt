The University of Rochester last week announced that its gait analyst . Orthopedist Russell Plato Schwartz , will build a race track on a farm which he has just bought overlooking the Genesee River . There Dr. Schwartz will walk , trot , single-step , lope and gallop horses on whose backs will be strapped an electric recording device which Dr. Schwartz calls an electrobasograph . This will show by means of wires attached to the hoofs , details of locomotion which the fastest cinema cameras have failed to catch . Eventually Dr. Schwartz " hopes to determine precisely what makes a good race horse . " <P> The horse track will be the second field extension of a laboratory to study locomotion which Dr. Schwartz has conducted in the University of Rochester Medical School since 1926 . His studies of foot problems as old as Xenophon 's forced march across Asia Minor are original enough to have earned him a gold medal from the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons and a bronze medal from the American Medical Association . And practical enough for a Rochester shoe manufacturer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) support of Dr. Schwartz 's gait laboratory ; 2 ) maintenance of an extension gait laboratory in its own factory ; 3 ) manufacture of what Dr. Schwartz calls " balance-in-motion " shoes which " compel the wearer to walk naturally . " When properly fitted , " they correct flat feet , obliterate bunions and callouses , alleviate sacroiliac pain , and actually , in certain cases , cure mental derangements by removing strains from the muscles and tendons of locomotion . " <P> The principle of " balance-in-motion " is relatively simple . By means of electrobasographs Dr. Schwartz determined that in natural walking the big toe propels the body forward , the heel and outer margin of the middle feet merely bear weight . The heel strikes the ground first , stays there 0.4 sec . Then , 0.15 sec. after the beginning of the heel 's impact , the middle foot begins a 0.4-sec. roll upon the ground . Just as the heel lifts clear , the big toe comes down for a 0.2-sec. contact . The instant the toe of one foot is ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot comes down to begin a cycle on that side . <P> Flat feet , according to Dr. Schwartz , are usually due to malalignment of the heel bone with the tibia ( larger of the two long bones in the lower leg ) . Side swing of the heel throws all the muscles and tendons of the foot out of balance . " Since the tendons act as slings for the 26 bones of the foot , " reasons Dr. Schwartz , " those bones then have a tendency to slip out of their anatomical arrangement . " <P> To rearrange and brace the whole weakened structure he designed a shoe with a high , stiff , snug counter . This keeps the heel directly under the tibia , puts the heel in a straight line with the base and tip of the big toe , warps the instep into a springy arch . Shoes , according to Dr. Schwartz , must have heels to help throw the body forward while walking . Men 's heels should be supported eight eighths of an inch-from the ground , women 's fourteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
