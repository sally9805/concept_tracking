txt Unification Held Costly Proposed Price for the B. M. T. System Is Called Too Expensive for City To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : For twenty-five years the city has sustained a tremendous financial loss by virtue of the operation of its subways by the I. R. T , and the B. M. T. under the dual contracts . Now it is planned to impose another burden on the taxpayer for fifty years by means of unification . The phponents of unification seem more interested in saving the security holders of both lines than they are in helping the city to reduce its transit debt charges . No advocate of unification has yet shown that unification will Increase , extend or improve service on the city lines or that the city will receive any net revenue to apply to the payment of interest or sinking fund charges on securities issued when the lines were built . The taxpayer is now paying about $36,000,000 a year for transit debt service , which includes the obligations of the Independent System . Profit for the Companies The city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an investment of $394,000,000 in the old lines . Of this sum , $19,000,000 was a return on its vast investment , and the balance of $76,000,000 was the rental due under Contract 3 . The companies on a combined investment of about $330,000,000 have in this same period received the sum of $557,000,000 in preferential payments . The companies have done quite well under the dual contracts . It is proposed to purchase the B. M. T. system , including its street car and bus lines , for $175,000,000 . Payment is to be made by issuing , outside the debt limit , 3 per cent fifty-yea ? securities . The dual contracts expire in thirty years , at which time the city can acquire the B. M. T. system by paying about $1,000,000 . Why should the taxpayer be compelled to pay interest and sinking fund charges for twenty years after the expiration of the dual contracts ? If it is imperative that the B. M. T. lines be purchased now , then let the securities issued in payment have a thirty-year maturity . Amortizing these securities on such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show any financial gain to the city or any benefit to the straphanger . Reduction in Income The B. M. T. net income for its 1938 fiscal year was about $578,000 , a drop of about $4,000,000 from the previous year . This reduction of net income followed wage increases to its employes as a result of union contracts . Should another wage increase result from present wage negotiations , or should one be granted in the near future , the B. M. T. will be operating in the red . If we were to capitalize at 3 per cent the B. M. T. net income for last year , we should get a present value of about $20,000,000 . The 1937 combined assessed valuation of the transit companies was about $120,000.000 . I have often wondered how much weight was given to these elements of value in determining a purchase price for the B. M. T. system . The city is facing a deficit unless drastic reductions are made in expenditures . The present is an opportune time to halt all unification negotiations , and to begin a more thorough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again " hold the bag , " The lines should only be purchased at a price which will clearly show a profit to the city . The proposed price for the B. M. T. system will prove financially disastrous to the city . ISIDORE A. LEVITT , New York , March 29 , 1939 . Professor Blanchard Excepts To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In THE TIMES of March 28 a headline over a news report of a talk given by me before the Institute of Traffic Engineers read " Columbia Professor Proposes Compulsory Insurance as the Best Solution . " I did not propose nor recommend compulsory automobile liability insurance , nor have I done so at any other time . My talk was devoted to an analysis of the issues and a presentation of the facts on both sides of the compulsory insurance debate . I indicated explicitly that I was stating no conclusions . RALPH H. BLANCHARD . New York , March 29 , 1939 . Douglas Fir , Not Pine To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In Topics of The Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged by the head of the New York Botanical Garden to locate a 250-foot Douglas pine out of which to make the tallest flagpole in the world . If Mayor La Guardia should be successful , he would not only provide the Botanical Garden with the tallest flagpole in the world , but the only one in the world made from Douglas pine . The true name is Douglas fir , there being no such thing as a Douglas pine . EDWARD J. MAGEE . Castle Rock , Wash. , March 26 , 1939 . Spreading Racial Prejudice To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I witnessed a disgraceful scene last Saturday night in the Seventh Avenue subway . A boy came into the car selling Father Coughlin 's Social Justice and urging passengers to buy it . Following him was a group of men and women shouting : " Buy Christian only ! " " Save America ! Down with the Jews ! " " Read Social Justice ! " " Do not buy from Jews ! Buy from Christians only ! " and similar remarks . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prevent the spread of hatred and prejudice among us ? M. F. New York , March 27 , 1939 . Registering an Objection To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : May I protest against three words in the article on Hitler in last Sunday 's issue ? Those three words are " erratic feminine temperament , " which the author uses as an excuse for the actions of Hitler . I wish to call attention to the fact that it is not my sex which is making shambles of Europe . It is not my sex which is spending money in this country in a sort of grand emotional spree . It is not my sex which loves to fight so much that its individual members , even in the supposedly upper classes of society , " fight at the drop of a hat . " It is not my sex which first attacks , then ravishes and then kills many members of the other sex . In fact , I object intensely to this exceedingly stupid habit of ascribing to women practically all human faults , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have " feminine temperaments .

Plight of Small Farmers Relief for Them Declared Forgotten in Our Government Program To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES ' : This matter of " farm relief " goes back a long way  --  long before Secretary Wallace was born . In looking over the farm census figures for 1935 I was struck by the variety of sizes and conditions of farms , and I got to wondering just what class of farmers our Congress is trying to help . Total number of farms 6,812,350 Farms of less than 3 acres 35,573 Farms of 3 to 9 acres each 535,258 Farms 10 to 19 acres each 683,452 Farms 20 to 29 acres each 557,979 Farms 30 to 49 acres each. , , 882,164 Now here is a total of 2,694,426 farms of fewer than fifty acres each . Will some member of Congress tell us just what the present or proposed laws do or will do for the men  --  and there are a lot of them  --  with fewer than three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show , furthermore , that 20 per cent of the farmers have fewer than twenty acres each . Another group of 20 per cent own from twenty to forty-nine acres each . The first 20 per cent own 1.2 per cent of the total farm area , and the second 20 per cent own 4.5 per cent of the land . In other words , these two groups of very small land owners constitute 40 per cent of the farmers , but operate less than 6 per cent of the land . The question persists with me : What are we doing for this 40 per cent ? It would appear that they are the ones who ought to have government help , if any farmer should . The thought comes to me , maybe these are the folks the government is adding to the relief rolls throughout the farming regions . LISTER FARSUND . Story City , Iowa , March 28 , 1939 . Parking Violations To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Yesterday I found a summons on my car for parking overtime on Fortyfourth Street in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $2 tomorrow , payable , not by mail , but in person , for the evident purpose of causing me the greatest inconvenience and , incidentally , increasing my penalty by $1 for tunnel toll when I return tomorrow . In most cities it has been found that a fine of $2 is a sufficient penalty for this violation , without requiring a personal appearance , to make it an effective deterrent against repeated violations . Furthermore , since New York is Inviting to its Fair visitors from the entire country , most of whom will know nothing of special parking rules , why are not signs posted on the streets to inform motorists of parking time limitations , similar to those prohibiting parking during designated hours ? In the absence of signs , a visiting motorist is justified in assuming that there is no parking limitation . It will cost him $2 or more to learn of his mistake , but it will cost New York City a greater loss in good-will . GEORGE GOLD . Newark , March 29 , 1939 . Action on Bridge Regretted To THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the utmost disgust and sorrow that I read in THE TIMES that the City Council has approved the suspension bridge from the Battery to Brooklyn . This downtown section is one of the beauty spots of New York ; to me , a native New Yorker , it represents our New York , old and new . How beautiful , how majestic , how glorious ! Why destroy it all with a bridge ? Even if it cost 's more , why not a tunnel instead of what eventually , like all our elevated roads , will be torn down ? I , for one , can not understand why New Yorkers do not get up and say something . Where are the taxpayers ? Have they no word in the matter , or Is the Council the last word ? JOHN HAMILTON .
