Several times in Germany last week sex officially reared its head : <P> The Government 's vital statistics bureau announced that marriages in the Ostmark ( onetime Austria ) numbered 4,126 in July , almost quadrupling Austria 's 1,092 in July 1937 . Delighted , a bureau spokesman announced : " It is hoped that next year 's birthrate in the Ostmark will be at least double that of 1938 .

Photographers were barred by the police .
