Four times a day for six days ( five on Saturdays ) , a vast , synthetic sunburst explodes in the auditorium of Manhattan 's Radio City Music Hall , world 's biggest theatre . Sometimes the 75-piece Music Hall Symphony Orchestra plays almost prayerfully . Sometimes it lashes and groans through a hot , new delirium . The 46 young ladies in the Rockette troupe are equal to either occasion . They can move shyly and demurely in ballet tulle . They can kick and whirl giddily to shrieking brass . Exact , machine-like execution has made the Rockettes known wherever U. S. precision dancing is known and many a strict balletomane takes the organization seriously . New glory came last week to the Rockettes when Edmond Labb , general commissioner of the Paris Exposition , picked them out to dance at the Exposition 's international dance festival July 2 . The Rockettes are the first U. S. dance troupe officially invited to appear in France . They will represent the U. S. on a program that includes such distinguished performers as La Scala Ballet , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rockettes came into being in 1925 when a hoofer named Russell Markert rounded up 16 girls to dance at the Skouras Brothers ' Missouri Theatre in St. Louis . He called them the Missouri Rockets . When Broadway clamored for the troupe , Markert changed their name to the American Rockets and took them East . They danced in Publix theatres , in the Greenwich Village Follies . The late Producer Samuel ( ' Roxy " ) Rothafel signed them up for his Roxy Theatre as the Roxyettes . When Roxy went to the Rockefeller Center Music Hall in 1932 , the Roxyettes went with him . When he left two years later , they became the Rockettes and stayed on at Rockefeller Center . <P> Russell Markert still helps direct the Rockettes , helps work out their routines , which are divided between classical and tap dance numbers . Between their four shows daily he manages to sandwich rehearsals for new numbers . There are 46 in the troupe , but only 36 dance at one time . Rockettes earn $48.50 a week , dance three weeks out of four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She may be anywhere from 18 to 23 . Six of the girls are married , four engaged . There are more brunettes than blondes , three redheads . Few Rockettes are ravishing , because Markert cares more about legs than looks , but all are ambitious . Voted most likely to succeed in serious dancing was Jean Eckler of West Palm Beach , Fla . Most popular is Muriel Le Count of Jack son Heights , L. I. <P> The Rockettes reach Paris June 25 , will put up in suburban St. Cloud . Twelve Frenchwomen , hand-picked by Exposition authorities , will look after the Rockettes during their two-week stay to help keep their discipline and deportment up to its high U. S. standard . For their official appearance , the Rockettes will dance four of their most famous routines in 16 minutes : Military March , in which 72 legs operate as synchronously as two ; a buck &; wing number ; Midshipmen , a fast , stylized version of Annapolis drills ; Beguine , a sultry , rumba-ish performance for which the girls make up like mulattoes. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
