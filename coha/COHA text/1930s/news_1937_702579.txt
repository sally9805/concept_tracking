txt James J. Dooling , leader of Tammany , returned yesterday afternoon 1 after an eight-week stay in Miami i and will confer with members of the Tammany executive committee on the leadership situation during the week . He again indicated that he had no intention ' Of resigning . " I will talk with members of the executive committee to ? get their advice and decide what is best for the organization , " he said after his return . Mr. Dooling 's return was a day earlier than expected . He thereby avoided being met by newspaper 1 photographers and reporters on his arrival at the Pennsylvania Station . He was accompanied by Michael J. Kennedy , leader with Mr. Dooling of the Fifth Assembly District ; Mrs. Kennedy , and his sisters , the Misses Evelyn and Florence Dooling , who had been with . him in Florida . As a consequence of Mr. Dooling 's arrival twenty-fbur hours ahead of his announced schedule , he was met only by Bert Stand , secretary of Tammany , and Charles W. Culkin , a leader of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible successor in the leadership . Mr. Dooling went directly to his home at 460 West Forty-third Street , where he was visited later by a few personal friends . Health Seems Improved The Tammany chieftain , who has been in ill health since last Summer , acquired a fine tan during his stay in Florida and seemed to be improved in health . Members of the Tammany executive committee are divided in their opinions as to whether this improvement is real or seeming . Doubt remains that Mr. Dooling , who suffered a stroke last Summer , would be able to stand the strain of the approaching municipal campaign . Mr. Dooling , it is reported , has no doubt of his ability to do so . Mr. Dpoling 's return has made it . virtually certain that there will be some action by the Tammany exec1 utive committee by next week . A meeting this week is not expected , as- Mr. Dooling said he wished to consult some of the district leaders and this will take several days . James J. Hines , leader of the 1 Eleventh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 their recent visit to Miami a promise that he would send for them after his return to New York . It is expected that they will be among the earlier district leaders with whom Mr. Dooling will discuss the Tammany situation . Settlement of the Tammany leadership problem is desired not only iv Tammany , but by the Democratic 1 leaders of the other boroughs , be1 cause settlement must precede any 1 agreement upon organization candidates for the Democratic nomination for Mayor and other places on the city ticket . Mr. Dooling on his return said he personally had no I candidate . For Any One Who Can Win " Anybody who can beat Mayor La Guardia will suit me , " he said . " I i am probably one of the very few 1 who is not trying to push forward a personal preference . " Mr. Dooling indicated that he was Ifar from satisfied that the best interests of Tammany called for his I resignation or that it was desired by a majority of the leaders . So far , it was said , no district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number have urged him to stay ; Those in the latter group apparently have been influenced by fear of a bitter contest for the leadership if it should become vacant . Representative Christopher D. Sullivan has the support of a powerful group , but , although fifteen out of twenty-three votes in the . executive committee are claimed for him , there is doubt that he actually has more than seven or eight . A group that numbers among its members Mr. Hines , Mr. Culkin and William P. Kenneally , chairman of the executive committee , is opposed to the election-of Mr. Sullivan . Mr. Culkin seems at present to be the candidate of this group . Should Mr. Dooling decide to resign , Mr. Kenneally , as executive committee chairman , would become temporary leader pending election of a new leader . Mr. DeAling is reported to be strongly opposed to letting Mr. Kenneally have even temporary power . Although there is general belief in Tammany that Mr. Dooling will retire before the actual beginning of the city campaign , there is doubt that the executive committee , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oust him at this meeting . Many of the committee members are reluctant to take this step against a man in poor health and are said to be willing to give him more time for consideration . It is believed , however , that ultimately the committee will vote to depose him if he does not decide to resign before the time element , which will require the selection of a slate for the city ticket by July 1 , makes it necessary in the opinion of a majority of the committee to take steps to get another leader . Postmaster General James A. Farley , Democratic State and National Chairman , has kept out of the Tammany situation so far , except to inform some of the Tammany district leaders that he does not believe Mr. Sullivan would be the best selection for leader on the eve of a city campaign . Mr. Farley has told some of the district leaders that he does not wish to take any part in an attempt to oust Mr. Dooling , as he did in ousting John F. Curry , but that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to offer suggestions for a. new leader .
