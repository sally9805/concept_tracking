" Got enough to get there , " said Pa . " We ai n't left it all . We 'll have work right off . " " I ai n't a-gonna do it , " Wilson said . " I 'll git mean if you try . " Ma took the two bills from Pa 's hand . She folded them neatly and put them on the ground and placed the pork pan over them . " That 's where they 'll be , " she said . " If you don ' get ' em , somebody else will . " Wilson , his head still down , turned and went to his tent ; he stepped inside and the flaps fell behind him . For a few moments the family waited , and then , " We got to go , " said Tom . " It 's near four , I bet . " The family climbed on the truck , Ma on top , beside Granma . Tom and Al and Pa in the seat , and Winfield on Pa 's lap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cab . The preacher and Uncle John and Ruthie were in a tangle on the load . Pa called , " Good-by , Mister and Mis ' Wilson . " There was no answer from the tent . Tom started the engine and the truck lumbered away . And as they crawled up the rough road toward Needles and the highway , Ma looked back . Wilsonstood in front of his tent , staring after them , and his hat was in his hand . The sun fell full on his face . Ma waved her hand at him , but he did not respond . Tom kept the truck in second gear over the rough road , to protect the springs . At Needles he drove into a service station , checked the worn tires for air , checked the spares tied to the back . He had the gas tank filled , and he bought two five-gallon cans of gasoline and a two-gallon can of oil . He filled the radiator , begged a map , and studied it . The service-station boy , in his white uniform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You people sure have got nerve . " Tom looked up from the map . " What you mean ? " " Well , crossin ' in a jalopy like this .

But folks are kind of scared to stop at night . I 'd hate to be doing it . Takes more nerve than I 've got . " Tom grinned . " It do n't take no nerve to do somepin when there ai n't nothin ' else you can do . Well , thanks . We 'll drag on . " And he got in the truck and moved away . The boy in white went into the iron building where his helper labored over a book of bills . " mss , what a hard-lookingoutfit ! " " Them Okies ? They 're all hard-lookin ' . " " Jesus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " " Well , you and me got sense . Them goddamn Okies got no sense and no feeling . They ai n't human . A human being would n't live like they do . A human being could n't stand it to be so dirty and miserable . They ai n't a hell of a lot better than gorillas . " " Just the same I 'm glad I ai n't crossing the desert in no Hudson Super-Six . She sounds like a threshing machine . " The other boy looked down at his book of bills . And a big drop of sweat rolled down his finger and fell on the pink bills . " You know , they do n't have much trouble . They 're so goddamn dumb they do n't know it 's dangerous . And , t Almighty , they do n't know any better than what they got . Why worry ? "  | " I 'm not worrying . Just thought if it was me , I would n't like it . " " That 's ' cause you know better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wiped the sweat from the pink bill with his sleeve . The truck took the road and moved up the long hill , through the broken , rotten rock . The engine boiled very soon and Tom slowed down and took it easy . Up the long slope , winding and twisting through dead country , burned white and gray , and no hint of life in it . Once Tom stopped for a few moments to let the engine cool , and then he traveledon . They topped the pass while the sun was still up , and looked down on the desert  --  black cinder mountains in the distance , and the yellow sun reflected on the gray desert . The little starved bushes , sage and greasewood , threw bold shadows on the sand and bits of rock . The glaring sun was straight ahead . Tom held his hand before his eyes to see at all . They passed the crest and coasted down to cool the engine . They coasted down the long sweep to the floor of the desert , and the fan turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the driver 's seat , Tom and Al and Pa , and Winfield on Pa 's knee , looked into the bright descending sun , and their eyes were stony , and their brown faces were damp with perspiration . The burnt land and the black , cindery hills broke the even distance and made it terrible in the reddening light of the setting sun . Al said , " what a place . How 'd you like to walk acrost her ? " " People done it , " said Tom . " Lots a people done it ; an ' if they could , we could . " " Lots must a died , " said Al.  | " Well , we ai n't come out exac'ly clean . " Al was silent for a while , and the reddening desert swept past . " Think we 'll ever see them Wilsons again ? " Al asked . Tom flicked his eyes down to the oil gauge . " I got a hunch nobody ai n't gon na see Mis ' Wilson for long . Jus ' a hunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanta get out . " Tom looked over at him . " Might 's well let ever'body out ' fore we settle down to drivin ' tonight . " He slowed the car and brought it to a stop . Winfield scrambled out and urinated at the side of the road . Tom leaned out . " Anybody else ? " " We 're holdin ' our water up here , " Uncle John called . Pa said , " Winfiel ' , you crawl up on top . You put my legs to sleep a-settin ' on ' em . " The little boy buttoned his overallsand obediently crawled up the back board and on his hands and knees crawled over Granma 's mattress and forward to Ruthie . The truck moved on into the evening , and the edge of the sun struck the rough horizon and turned the desert red . Ruthie said , " Wouldn ' leave you set up there , huh ? " " I didn ' want to . It was n't so nice as here . Couldn ' lie down . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' a-talkin ' , " Ruthie said , " ' cause I 'm goin ' to sleep , an ' when I wake up , we gon na be there ! ' Cause Tom said so ! Gon na seem funny to see pretty country . " The sun went down and left a great halo in the sky . And it grew very dark under the tarpaulin , a long cave with light at each end  --  a flat triangle of light . Connie and Rose of Sharon leaned back against the cab , and the hot wind tumbling through the tent struck the backs of their heads , and the tarpaulin whipped and drummed 04above them . They spoke together in low tones , pitched to the drumming canvas , so that no one could hear them . When Connie spoke he turned his head and spoke into her ear , and she did the same to him . She said , " Seems like we was n't never gon na do nothin ' but move . I 'm so tar 'd . " He turned his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How 'd you like to be alone now ? " In the dusk his hand moved out and stroked her hip . She said , " Do n't . You 'll make me crazy as a loon . Do n't do that . " And she turned her head to hear his response . " Maybe  --  when ever'body 's asleep . " " Maybe , " she said . " But wait till they get to sleep . You 'll make me crazy , an ' maybe they wo n't get to sleep . " " I ca n't hardly stop , " he said . " I know . Me neither . Le 's talk about when we get there ; an ' you move away ' fore I get crazy . " He shifted away a little . " Well , I 'll get to studyin ' nights right off , " he said . She sighed deeply . " Gon na get one a them books that tells about it an ' cut the coupon , right off .

" What you gon na need ice roun ' Christmus for ? " She giggled . " Tha 's right . But I 'd like ice any time . Now do n't . You 'll get me crazy ! " The dusk passed into dark and the desert stars came out inp305the soft sky , stars stabbing and sharp , with few points and rays to them , and the sky was velvet . And the heat changed . While the sun was up , it was a beating , flailing heat , but now the heat came from below , from the earth itself , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck came on , and they illuminated a little blur of highway ahead , and a strip of desert on either side of the road . And sometimes eyes gleamed in the lights far ahead , but no animal showed in the lights . It was pitch dark under the canvas now . Uncle John and the preacher were curled in the middle of the truck , resting on their elbows , and staring out the back triangle . They could see the two bumps that were Ma and Granma against the outside . They could see Ma move occasionally , and her dark arm moving against the outside . Uncle John talked to the preacher . " Casy , " he said , " you 're a fella ought a know what to do . " " What to do about what ? " " I du n no , " said Uncle John . Casy said , " Well , that 's gon na make it easy for me !

" I du n no . " " Well  --  see  --  I was married  --  fine , good girl . An ' one night she got a pain in her stomach . An ' she says , You better get a doctor . ' An ' I says , Hell , you jus ' et too much . ' " Uncle John put his hand on Casy 's knee and he peered through the darkness at him . " She give me a look . An ' she groaned all night , an ' she died the next afternoon . " The preacher mum- 06bled something . " You see , " John went on , " I kil't her . An ' sence then I tried to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to be good , an ' I ca n't . I get drunk , an ' I go wild . " " Ever'body goes wild , " said Casy . " I do too . " " Yeah , but you ai n't got a sin on your soul like me . " Casy said gently , " Sure I got sins . Ever'body got sins . A sin is somepin you ai n't sure about . Them people that 's sure about ever'thing an ' ai n't got no sin  --  well , with that kind a son-of-a-bitch , if I was God I 'd kick their ass right outa heaven ! I couldn ' stand ' em ! " Uncle John said , " I got a feelin ' I 'm bringin ' bad luck to my own folks . I got a feelin ' I ought a go away an ' let ' em be . I ai n't comf'table bein ' like this .

On'y one thing in this worl ' I 'm sure of , an ' that 's I 'm sure nobody got a right to mess with a fella 's life . He got to do it all hisself . Help him , maybe , but not tell him what to do . " Uncle John said disappointedly , " Then you don ' know ? " " I don ' know . " " You think it was a sin to let my wife die like that ? " " Well , " said Casy , " for anybody else it was a mistake , but if you think it was a sin  --  then it 's a sin . A fella builds his own sins right up from the groun ' . " " I got to give that a goin ' - over , " said Uncle John , and he rolled on his back and lay with his knees pulled up . The truck moved on over the hot earth , and the hours passed . Ruthie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the load and covered himself and Rose of Sharon with it , and in the heat they struggled together , and held their breaths . And after a time Connie threw off thep307blanket and the hot tunneling wind felt cool on their wet bodies . On the back of the truck Ma lay on the mattress beside ( ; ranma , and she could not see with her eyes , but she could feel the struggling body and the struggling heart ; and the sobbing breath was in her ear . And Ma said over and over , " All right . It 's gon na be all right . " And she said hoarsely , " You know the family got to get acrost . You know that . " Uncle John called , " You all right ? " It was a moment before she answered . " All right . Guess I dropped off to sleep . " And after a time Granma was still , and Ma lay rigid beside her . The night hours passed , and the dark was in against the truck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sometimes great trucks came up out of the west and rumbled eastward . And the stars flowed down in a slow cascadeover the western horizon . It was near midnight when they neared Daggett , where the inspection station is . The road was floodlighted there , and a sign illuminated , " KEEP RIGHT AND STOP . " The officers loafed in the office , but t hey came out and stood under the long covered shed when Tom pulled in . One officer put down the license number and raised the hood . Tom asked , " What 's this here ? " " Agricultural inspection . We got to look over your stuff . Got any vegetables or seeds ? " " No , " said Tom . " Well , we got to look over your stuff . You got to unload . " Now Ma climbed heavily down from the truck . Her face was swollen and her eyes were hard . " Look , mister . We got a sick of lady . We got to get her to a doctor . We ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You ca n't make us wait . "  |p3o8  " Yeah ? Well , we got to look you over . " " I swear we ai n't got any thing ! " Ma cried . " I swear it . An ' Granma 's awful sick . " " You do n't look so good yourself , " the officer said . Ma pulled herself up the back of the truck , hoisted herself with huge strength . " Look , " she said . The officer shot a flashlight beam up on the old shrunken face . " By God , she is , " he said . " You swear you got no seeds or fruits or vegetables , no corn , no oranges ? " " No , no . I swear it ! " " Then go ahead . You can get a doctor in Barstow . That 's only eight miles . Go on ahead . " Tom climbed in and drove on . The officer turned to his companion . " I couldn ' hold ' em . " " Maybe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , God no ! You should of seen that of woman 's face . That was n't no bluff . " Tom increased his speed to Barstow , and in the little town he stopped , got out , and walked around the truck . Ma leaned out . " It 's awright , " she said . " I didn ' wanta stop there , fear we wouldn ' get acrost . " " Yeah ! But how 's Granma ? " " She 's awright  --  awright . Drive on . We got to get acrost . " Tom shook his head and walked back . " Al , " he said , " I 'm gon na fill her up , an ' then you drive some . " He pulled to an all-night gas station and filled the tank and the radiator , and filled the crank case . Then Al slipped under the wheel and Tom took the outside , with Pa in the middle . They drove away into the darkness and the little hills near Barstow were behind them . Tom said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's flighty as a dog with a flea in his ear . Wouldn ' a took long to lookp309over the stuff . An ' she says Granma 's sick ; an ' now she says Granma 's awright . I ca n't figger her out . She ai n't right . S'pose she wore her brains out on the trip . " Pa said , " Ma 's almost like she was when she was a girl . She was a wild one then . She wasn ' scairt of nothin ' . I thought havin ' all the kids an ' workin ' took it out a her , but I guess it ai n't . When she got that jack handle back there , I tell you I wouldn ' wan na be the fella took it away from her .

" Tom said , " Well , you done a damn good job a pickin ' . We ai n't had hardly no trouble with her at all . " All night they bored through the hot darkness , and jackrabbitsscuttled into the lights and dashed away in long joltingleaps . And the dawn came up behind them when the lights of Mojave were ahead . And the dawn showed high mountains to the west . They filled with water and oil at Mojave and crawled into the mountains , and the dawn was about them . Tom said , " Jesus the desert 's past ! Pa , Al , for Christ 's sakes ! The desert 's past ! " " I 'm too goddamn tired to care , " said Al . " Want me to drive ? " " No , wait awhile . " They drove through Tehachapi in the morning glow , and the sun came up behind them , and then  --  suddenly they saw the great valley below them . Al jammed on the brake and stopped in the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The vineyards , the orchards , the great flat valley ,  | green and beautiful , the trees set in rows , and the farm houses . And Pa said , God almighty " The distant cities , the little towns in the orchard land , and the morning sun , golden on the valley . A car honked behind them . Al pulled to the side of the road and parked . " I want to look at her . " The grain fields golden in the morning , and the willow lines , the eucalyptus trees in rows . Pa sighed , " I never knowed they was anything like her . " The peach trees and the walnut groves , and the dark green patches of oranges . And red roofs among the trees , and barns  --  rich barns . Al got out and stretched his legs . He called , " Ma  --  come look . We 're there ! " Ruthie and Winfield scrambled down from the car , and then they stood , silent and awestruck , embarrassed before the great valley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew softer and softer in the distance . A windmill flashed in the sun , and its turning blades were like a little heliograph , far away . Ruthie and Winfield looked at it , and Ruthie whispered , " It 's California . " Winfield moved his lips silently over the syllables . " There 's fruit , " he said aloud . Casy and Uncle John , Connie and Rose of Sharon climbed down . And they stood silently . Rose of Sharon had started to brush her hair back , when she caught sight of the valley and her hand dropped slowly to her side . Tom said , " Where 's Ma ? I want Ma to see it . Look , Ma ! Come here , Ma . " Ma was climbing slowly , stiffly , down the back board . Tom looked at her . " My God , Ma , you sick ? " Her face was stiff and putty-like , and her eyes seemed to have sunk deep into her head , and the rims were red withp311weariness . Her feet touched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice was a croak . " Ya say we 're acrost ? " Tom pointed to the great valley . " Look ! " She turned her head , and her mouth opened a little . Her fingers went to her throat and gathered a little pinch of skin and twisted gently . " Thank God ! " she said . " The fambly 's here . " Her knees buckled and she sat down on the running board . " You sick , Ma ? " " No , jus ' tar 'd . " " Didn ' you get no sleep ? " " No . " " Was Granma bad ? " Ma looked down at her hands , lying together like tired lovers in her lap . " I wisht I could wait an ' not tell you . I wisht it could be all  --  nice . " Pa said , " Then Granma 's bad . " Ma raised her eyes and looked over the valley . " Granma 's dead . " They looked at her , all of them , and Pa asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ las ' night . " " So that 's why you didn ' want ' em to look . " " I was afraid we wouldn ' get acrost , " she said . " I tol ' Granma we couldn ' he'p her . The fambly had to get acrost . I tol ' her , tol ' her when she was a-dyin ' . We couldn ' stop in the desert . There was the young ones  --  an ' Rosasharn 's baby . I tol ' her . " She put up her hands and covered her face for a moment . " She can get buried in a nice green place , " Ma said softly . " Trees aroun ' an ' a nice place . She got to lay her head down in California . "  |p312The  family looked at Ma with a little terror at her strength . Tom said , ' JesusChrist ! You layin ' there with her all night long ! " " The fambly hadda get acrost , " Ma said miserably . Tom moved close to put his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " I 'll hol ' up if you don ' touchme . That 'd get me . " Pa said , " We got to go on now . We got to go on down . " Ma looked up at him . " Can  --  can I set up front ? I don ' wan na go back there no more  --  I 'm tar 'd . I 'm awful tar 'd . " They climbed back on the load , and they avoided the long stiff figure covered and tucked in a comforter , even the head covered and tucked . They moved to their places and tried to keep their eyes from it  --  from the hump on the comfort that would be the nose , and the steep cliff that would be the jut of the chin . They tried to keep their eyes away , and they could not . Ruthie and Winfield , crowded in a forward corneras far away from the body as they could get , stared at the tucked figure . And Ruthie whispered , " Tha 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded solemnly . " She ai n't breathin ' at all . She 's awful dead . " And Rose of Sharon said softly to Connie , " She was adyin ' right when we --  " " How 'd we know ? " he reassured her . Al climbed on the load to make room for Ma in the seat . And AI swaggered a little because he was sorry . He plumped down beside Casy and Uncle John . " Well , she was ol ' . Guess her time was up , " Al said . " Ever'body got to die . " Casy and Uncle John turned eyes expressionlessly on him and looked at him as though he were a curious talking bush . " Well ,  | 3ai n't they ? " he demanded . And the eyes looked away , leavingAI sullen and shaken . Casy said in wonder , " All night long , an ' she was alone . " And he said , " John , there 's a woman so great with love  --  she scares me . Makes me afraid an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sin ? Is they any part of it you might call a sin ? " Casy turned on him in astonishment , " A sin ? No , there ai n't no part of it that 's a sin . " " I ai n't never done nothin ' that was n't part sin , " said John , and he looked at the long wrapped body . Tom and Ma and Pa got into the front seat . Tom let the truck roll and started on compression . And the heavy truck moved , snorting and jerking and popping down the hill . The sun was behind them , and the valley golden and green before them . Ma shook her head slowly from side to side . " It 's purty , " she said . " I wisht they could of saw it . " " I wisht so too , " said Pa . Tom patted the steering wheel under his hand . " They was too old , " he said . " They would n't of saw nothin ' that 's here . Grampa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prairie countrywhen he was a young fella . An ' Granma would a rememberedan ' seen the first home she lived in . They was too ol ' .

Tommy 's growed way up  --  way up so I ca n't get aholt of ' im sometimes . " They popped down the mountain , twisting and looping , losing the valley sometimes , and then finding it again . And the hot breath of the valley came up to them , with hot green smells on it , and with resinous sage and tarweed smells . The crickets crackled along the road . A rattlesnake crawled across the road and Tom hit it and broke it and left it squirming . Tom said , " I guess we got to go to the coroner , wherever he is . We got to get her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pa ? " " ' Bout forty dollars , " said Pa . Tom laughed . " , are we gon na start clean ! We surc ai n't bringin ' nothin ' with us . " He chuckled a moment , and then his face straightened quickly . He pulled the visor of his cap down low over his eyes . And the truck rolled down the mountain into the great valley.  | ONCE California belonged to Mexico and its land to Mexicans ; and a horde of tattered feverish Americanspoured in . And such was their hunger for land that they took the land  --  stole Sutter 's land , Guerrero 's land , took the grants and broke them up and growled and quarreledover them , those frantic hungry men ; and they guarded with guns the land they had stolen . They put up houses and barns , they turned the earth and planted crops . And these things were possession , and possession was ownership . The Mexicans were weak and fed . They could not resist , because they wanted nothing in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with time , the squatters were no longer squatters , but owners ; and their children grew up and had children on the land . And the hunger was gone from them , the feral hunger , the gnawing , tearing hunger for land , for water and earth and the good sky over it , for the green thrusting grass , for the swelling roots . They had these things so completely that they did not know about them any more . They had no more the stomach-tearing lust for a rich acre and a shining blade to plow it , for seed and a windmill beating its wings in the air . They arose in the dark no more to hear the sleepy birds ' first chittering , and the morning wind around the house while they waited for the first light to go out to the dear acres . These things were lost , and crops were reckoned in dollars , and land was valued by principal plus interest , and crops were bought and sold before they were planted . Then crop failure , drought , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple losses of money . And all their love was thinned with money , and all their fierceness dribbled away in interest until they were no longer farmers at all , but little shopkeepers of crops , little manufacturers who must sell before they can make . Then those farmers who were not good shopkeepers lost their land to good shopkeepers . No matter how clever , how loving a man might he with earth and growing things , he could not survive if he were not also a good shopkeeper . And as time went on , the businessmen had the farms , and the farms grew larger , but there were fewer of them . Now farming became industry , and the owners followed Rome , although they did not know it . They imported slaves , although they did not call them slaves : Chinese , Japanese , Mexicans , Filipinos . They live on rice and beans , the business men said . They do n't need much . They would n't know what to do with good wages . Why , look how they live . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get funny  --  deport them . And all the time the farms grew larger and the owners fewer . And there were pitifully few farmers on the land any more . And the imported serfs were beaten and frightened and starved until some went home again , and some grew fierce and were killed or driven from the country . And the farms grew larger and the owners fewer . And the crops changed . Fruit trees took the place of grain fields , and vegetables to feed the world spread out on the bottoms : lettuce , cauliflower , artichokes , potatoes  --  stoop crops . A man may stand to use a scythe , a plow , a pitchfork ; but he must crawl like a bug between the rows of lettuce , hep317must bend his back and pull his long bag between the cotton rows , he must go on his knees like a penitent across a cauliflowerpatch . And it came about that owners no longer worked on their farms . They farmed on paper ; and they forgot the land , the smell , the feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remembered only what they gained and lost by it . And some of the farms grew so large that one man could not even conceive of them any more , so large that it took batteriesof bookkeepers to keep track of interest and gain and loss ; chemists to test the soil , to replenish ; straw bosses to see that the stooping men were moving along the rows as swiftly as the material of their bodies could stand . Then such a farmer really became a storekeeper , and kept a store . He paid the men , and sold them food , and took the money back . And after a while he did not pay the men at all , and saved bookkeeping . These farms gave food on credit . A man might work and feed himself ; and when the work was done , he might find that he owed money to the company . And the owners not only did not work the farms any more , many of them had never seen the farms they owned . And then the dispossessed were drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico ; from Nevada and Arkansas families , tribes , dusted out , tractored out . Carloads , caravans , homeless and hungry ; twenty thousand and fifty thousand and a hundred thousand and two hundred thousand . They streamed over the mountains , hungry and restless  --  restless as ants , scurrying to find work to do  --  to lift , to push , to pull , to pick , to cut  --  anything , any burden to bear , for food . The kids are hungry . We got no place to live . Like ants scurrying for work , for food , and most of all for land . We ai n't foreign . Seven generations back Americans , and beyond that Irish , Scotch , English , German . One of our folks in the Revolution , an ' they was lots of our folks in the Civil War  --  both sides . Americans . They were hungry , and they were fierce . And they had hoped to find a home , and they found only hatred . Okiestheowners hated them because the owners knew they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fed and the Okies hungry ; and perhaps the owners had heard from their grandfathershow easy it is to steal land from a soft man if , you are fierce and hungry and armed . The owners hated them . And in the towns , the storekeepers hated them because they had no money to spend . There is no shorter path to a storekeeper'scontempt , and all his admirations are exactly opposite . The town men , little bankers , hated Okies because there was nothing to gain from them . They had nothing . And the laboring people hated Okies because a hungry man must work , and if he must work , if he has to work , the wage payer automatically gives him less for his work ; and then no one can get more . And the dispossessed , the migrants , flowed into California , two hundred and fifty thousand , and three hundred thousand . Behind them new tractors were going on the land and the tenants were being forced off . And new waves were on the way , new waves of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous . And while the Californians wanted many things , accumulation , social success , amusement , luxury , and a curious bankingsecurity , the new barbarians wanted only two things -- land and food ; and to them the two were one . And whereas the wants of the Californians were nebulous and undefined , the wants of the Okies were beside the roads , lying there to be seen and coveted : the good fields with water to be dug for , the good green fields , earth to crumble experimentally in the hand , grass to smell , oaten stalks to chew until the sharp sweetness was in the throat . A man might look at a fallow field and know , and see in his mind that his own bendingback and his own straining arms would bring the cabbagesinto the light , and the golden eating corn , the turnips and carrots . And a homeless hungry man , driving the roads with his wife beside him and his thin children in the back seat , could look at the fallow fields which might produce food but not profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a sin and the unused land a crime against the thin children . And such a man drove along the roads and knew temptation at every field , and knew the lust to take these fields and make them grow strength for his children and a little comfort for his wife . The temptation was before him always . The fields goaded him , and the company ditches with good water flowingwere a goad to him . And in the south he saw the golden oranges hanging on the trees , the little golden oranges on the dark green trees ; and guards with shotguns patrolling the lines so a man might not pick an orange for a thin child , oranges to be dumped if the price was low . He drove his old car into a town . He scoured the farms for work . Where can we sleep the night ? Well , there 's Hooverville on the edge of the river . There 's a whole raft of Okies there . He drove his old car to Hooverville . He never asked again , for there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rag town lay close to water ; and the houses were tents , and weed-thatched enclosures , paper houses , a great junk pile . The man drove his family in and became a citizen of Hooverville  --  always they were called Hooverville . The man put up his own tent as near to water as he could get ; or if he had no tent , he went to the city dump and brought back cartons and built a house of corrugated paper . And when the rains came the house melted and washed away . He settled in Hooverville and he scoured the countryside for work , and the little money he had went for gasoline to look for work . In the evening the men gathered and talked together . Squatting on their hams they talked of the land they had seen . There 's thirty thousan ' acres , out west of here . Layin ' there . Jesus what I could do with that , with five acres ofthat ! Why , hell , I 'd have ever'thing to eat . Notice one thing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farms . They raise one thing  --  cotton , say , or peaches , or lettuce . ' Nother place 'll be all chickens . They buy the stuff they could raise in the dooryard . Jesus what I could do with a couple pigs ! Well , it ai n't yourn , an ' it ai n't gon na be ' yourn . What we gon na do ? The kids ca n't grow up this way . In the camps the word would come whispering , There 's work at Shafter . And the cars would be loaded in the night , the highways crowded  --  a gold rush for work . At Shafter the people would pile up , five times too many to do the work . A gold rush for work . They stole away in the night , frantic for work . And along the roads lay the temptations , the fields that could bear food . That 's owned . That ai n't our'n . Well , maybe we could get a little piece of her . Maybe  --  a little piece . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could git enough potatoes off'n that little patch to feed my whole family !  |p321It  ai n't our'n . It got to have Jimson weeds . Now and then a man tried ; crept on the land and cleared a piece , trying like a thief to steal a little richness from the earth . Secret gardens hidden in the weeds . A package of carrot seeds and a few turnips . Planted potato skins , crept out in the evening secretly to hoe in the stolen earth . Leave the weeds around the edge  --  then nobody can see what we 're a-doin ' . Leave some weeds , big tall ones , in the middle . Secret gardening in the evenings , and water carried in a rusty can . And then one day a deputy sheriff : Well , what you think you 're doin ' ? I ai n't doin ' no harm . I had my eye on you . This ai n't your land . You 're trespassing . The land ai n't plowed , an ' I ai n't hurtin ' it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you owned it . You 'd be sore as hell . Think you owned it . Get off now . And the little green carrot tops were kicked off and the turnip greens trampled . And then the Jimson weed moved back in . But the cop was right . A crop raised  --  why , that makes ownership . Land hoed and the carrots eaten  --  a man might fight for land he 's taken food from . Get him off quick ! He 'll think he owns it . He might even die fighting for the little plot among the Jimson weeds . Did ya see his face when we kicked them turnips out ? Why , he 'd kill a fella soon 's he 'd look at him . We got to keep these here people down or they 'll take the country . They 'll take the country . Outlanders , foreigners.  | Sure , they talk the same language , but they ai n't the same . Look how they live . Think any of us folks 'd live like that ? Hell , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excited man : Why n't twenty of us take a piece of Ian ' ? We got guns . Take it an ' say , " Put us off if you can . " Why n't we do that ? They 'd jus ' shoot us like rats . Well , which 'd you ruther be , dead or here ? Under groun ' or in a house all made of gunny sacks ? Which 'd you ruther for your kids , dead now or dead in two years with what they call malnutrition ? Know what we et all week ? Biled nettles an ' fried dough ! Know where we got the flour for the dough ? Swep ' the floor of a boxcar . Talking in the camps , and the deputies , fat-assed men with guns slung on fat hips , swaggering through the camps : Give ' em somepin to think about . Got to keep ' em in line or only knows what they 'll do ! Why , they 're as dangerousas niggers in the South ! If they ever get together there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quote : In Lawrenceville a deputy sheriff evicted a squatter , and the squatter resisted , making it necessary for the officer to use force . The eleven-year-old son of the squatter shot and killed the deputy with a .22 rifle . Rattlesnakes ! Do n't take chances with ' em , an ' if they argue , shoot first . If a kid 'll kill a cop , what 'll the men do ? Thing is , get tougher'n they are . Treat ' em rough . Scare ' ern . What if they wo n't scare ? What if they stand up and take it and shoot back ? These men were armed when they were children . A gun is an extension of themselves . What if they wo n't scare ? What if some time an army of them marches on the land as the Lombards did in Italy , as the Germans did on Gaul and the Turks did on Byzantium ? They were landhungry , ill-armed hordes too , and the legions could not stop them . Slaughter and terror did not stop them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in his own cramped stomach but in the wretched bellies of his children ? You ca n't scare him  --  he has known a fear beyond every other . In Hooverville the men talking : Grampa took his lan ' from the Injuns . Now , this ai n't right . We 're a-talkin ' here . This here you 're talkin ' about is stealin ' . I ai n't no thief . No ? You stole a bottle of milk from a porch night before last . An ' you stole some copper wire and sold it for a piece of meat . Yeah , but the kids was hungry . It 's stealin ' , though . Know how the Fairfiel ' ranch was got ? 1 ' 11 tell ya . It was all gov'ment lan ' , an ' could be took up . 01 ' Fairfiel ' , he went into San Francisco to the bars , an ' he got him three hunderd stew bums . Them bums took up the lan ' . Fairfiel ' kep ' ' em in food an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ian ' , of Fairfiel ' took it from ' em . He used to say the lan ' cost him a pint of rotgut an acre . Would you say that was stealin ' ? Well , it was n't right , but he never went to jail for it . No , he never went to jail for it . An ' the fella that put a boat in a wagon an ' made his report like it was all under water ' cause he went in a boat  --  he never went to jail neither . An ' the fellas that bribed congressmen and the legislatures never went to jail neither . All over the State , jabbering in the Hoovervilles.  | And then the raids  --  the swoop of armed deputies on the squatters ' camps . Get out . Department of Health orders . This camp is a menace to health . Where we gon na go ? That 's none of our business . We got orders to get you out of here . In half an hour we set fire to the camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ta spread it all over ? We got orders to get you out of here . Now get ! In half an hour we burn the camp . In half an hour the smoke of paper houses , of weedthatchedhuts , rising to the sky , and the people in their cars rolling over the highways , looking for another Hooverville . And in Kansas and Arkansas , in Oklahoma and Texas and New Mexico , the tractors moved in and pushed the tenants out . Three hundred thousand in California and more coming . And in California the roads full of frantic people running like ants to pull , to push , to lift , to work . For every manload to lift , five pairs of arms extended to lift it ; for every stomachfulof food available , five mouths open . And the great owners , who must lose their land in an upheaval , the great owners with access to histor , with eyes to read histor and to know the great fact : w en property accumulates in too few hands it is ta en away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people arehungry and cold they will take by force what they need . And the little screaming fact that sounds through all history : repressionworks only to strengthen and knit the repressed . The great - owners ignored the three cries of history . The land fell into fewer hands , the number of the dispossessed increased , andp325every effort of the great owners was directed at repression . The money was spent for arms , for gas to protect the great holdings , and spies were sent to catch the murmuring of revoltso that it might be stamped out . The changing economy was ignored , plans for the change ignored ; and only means to destroy revolt were considered , while the causes of revolt went on . The tractors which throw men out of work , the belt lines which carry loads , the machines which produce , all were increased ; and more and more families scampered on the highways , looking for crumbs from the great holdings , lustingafter the land beside the roads . The great owners formed associations for protection and they met to discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And always they were in fear of a principal  --  three hundred thousand  --  if they ever move under a leader  --  the end . Three hundred thousand , hungry and miserable ; if they ever know themselves , the land will be theirs and all the gas , all the rifles in the world wo n't stop them . And the great owners , who had become through their holdingsboth more and less than men , ran to their destruction , and used every means that in the long run would destroy them . Every little means , every violence , every raid on a Hooverville , every deputy swaggering through a ragged camp put off the day a little and cemented the inevitability of the day . The men squatted on their hams , sharp-faced men , lean from hunger and hard from resisting it , sullen eyes and hard jaws . And the rich land was around them . D'ja hear about the kid in that fourth tent down ? No , I jus ' come in . Well , that kid 's been a-cryin ' in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks thought he got worms . So they give him a blaster , an ' he died . It was what they call black-tongue the kid had . Comes from not gettin ' good things to eat . Poor little fella . Yeah , but them folks ca n't bury him . Got to go to the county stone orchard . Well , hell . And hands went into pockets and little coins came out . In front of the tent a little heap of silver grew . And the family found it there . Our people are good people ; our people are kind people . Pray God some day kind people wo n't all be poor . Pray God some day a kid can eat . And the associations of owners knew that some day the praying would stop . And there 's the end.  | THE family , on top of the load , the children and Connie and Rose of Sharon and the preacher were stiff and cramped . They had sat in the heat in front of the coroner 's office in Bakersfield while Pa and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was brought out and the long bundle lifted down from the truck . And they sat in the sun while the examination went on , while the cause of death was found and the certificate signed . Al and Tom strolled along the street and looked in store windows and watched the strange people on the sidewalks . And at last Pa and Ma and Uncle John came out , and they were subdued and quiet . Uncle John climbed up on the load . Pa and Ma got in the seat . Tom and Al strolled back and Tom got under the steering wheel . He sat there silently , waiting for some instruction . Pa looked straight ahead , his dark hat pulled low . Ma rubbed the sides of her mouth with her fingers , and her eyes were far away and lost , dead with weariness . Pa sighed deeply . " They was n't nothin ' else to do , " he said . " I know , " said Ma . " She would a liked a nice funeral , though . She always wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County ? " he asked . " Yeah , " Pa shook his head quickly , as though to get back to some reality . " We didn ' have enough . We couldn ' of done it . " He turned to Ma . " You ai n't to feel bad . We couldn ' no matter how hard we tried , no matter what we done . We jus ' didn ' have it ; embalming , an ' a coffin an ' a preacher , an ' a plot in a graveyard . It would of took ten times what we got . We done the bes ' we could . " " I know , " Ma said . " I jus ' ca n't get it outa my head what store she set by a nice funeral . Got to forget it . " She sighed deeply and rubbed the side of her mouth . " That was a purty nice fella in there . Awful bossy , but he was purty nice . " " Yeah , " Pa said . " He give us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair back with her hand . Her jaw tightened . " We got to git , " she said . " We got to find a place to stay . We got to get work an ' settle down . No use a-lettin ' the little fellas go hungry . That was n't never Granma 's way . She always et a good meal at a funeral . " " Where we goin ' ? " Tom asked . Pa raised his hat and scratched among his hair . " Camp , " he said . " We ai n't gon na spen ' what little 's lef ' till we get work . Drive out in the country . " Tom started the car and they rolled through the streets and out toward the country . And by a bridge they saw a collection of tents and shacks . Tom said , " Might 's well stop here . Find out what 's doin ' , an ' where at the work is . " He drove down a steep dirt incline and parked on the edge of the encampment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tents , shacks , cars were scattered about at random . The first house was nondescript . The south wall was made of three sheets of rusty corrugated iron , the east wall a square of moldy carpet tacked between two boards , the north wall a strip of roofingpaper and a strip of tattered canvas , and the west wall six pieces of gunny sacking . Over the square frame , on un-Lp329trimmed willow limbs , grass had been piled , not thatched , but heaped up in a low mound . The entrance , on the gunnysackside , was cluttered with equipment . A five-gallon kerosenecan served for a stove . It was laid on its side , with a sectionof rusty stovepipe thrust in one end . A wash boiler rested on its side against the wall ; and a collection of boxes lay about , boxes to sit on , to eat on . A Model T Ford sedan and a two-wheel trailer were parked beside the shack , and about the camp there hung a slovenly despair . Next to the shack there was a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up ; and the boxes in front of it were placed against the tent wall . A stovepipe stuck out of the door flap , and the dirt in front of the tent had been swept and sprinkled . A bucketful of soaking clothes stood on a box . The camp was neat and sturdy . A Model A roadster and a little home-made bed trailer stood beside the tent . And next there was a huge tent , ragged , torn in strips and the tears mended with pieces of wire . The flaps were up , and inside four wide mattresses lay on the ground . A clothes line strung along the side bore pink cotton dresses and several pairs of overalls . There were forty tents and shacks , and beside each habitation some kind of automobile . Far down the line a few children stood and stared at the newly arrived truck , and they moved toward it , little boys in overalls and bare feet , their hair gray with dust . Tom stopped the truck and looked at Pa . " She ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go somewheres else ? " " Ca n't go nowheres else till we know where we 're at , " Pa said . " We got to ast about work . " Tom opened the door and stepped out . The family climbed down from the load and looked curiously at the camp . Ruthie and Winfield , from the habit of the road , took down the bucket and walked toward the willows , where there would be water ; and the line of children parted for them and closed after them . The flaps of the first shack parted and a woman looked out . Her gray hair was braided , and she wore a dirty , floweredMother Hubbard . Her face was wizened and dull , deep gray pouches under blank eyes , and a mouth slack and loose . Pa said , " Can we jus ' pull up anywheres an ' camp ? " The head was withdrawn inside the shack . For a moment there was quiet and then the flaps were pushed aside and a bearded man in shirt sleeves stepped out . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come into the open . The bearded man said , " Howdy , folks , " and his restless dark eyes jumped to each member of the family , and from them to the truck to the equipment . Pa said , " I jus ' ast your woman if it 's all right to set our stuff anywheres . " The bearded man looked at Pa intently , as though he had said something very wise that needed thought . " Set down anywheres , here in this place ? " he asked . " Sure . Anybody own this place , that we got to see ' fore we can camp ? " The bearded man squinted one eye nearly closed and studied Pa . " You wanta camp here ? " Pa 's irritation arose . The gray woman peered out of the burlap shack . " What you think I 'm a-sayin ' ? " Pa said . " Well , if you wanta camp here , why do n't ya ? I ai n't a-stoppin ' you . " Tom laughed . " He got it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' wanted to know does anybodyown it ? Do we got to pay ? "  | The bearded man thrust out his jaw . " Who owns it ? " he demanded . Pa turned away . " The hell with it , " he said . The woman 's head popped back in the tent . The bearded man stepped forward menacingly . " Who owns it ? " he demanded . " Who 's gon na kick us outa here ? You tell me . " Tom stepped in front of Pa . " You better go take a good long sleep , " he said . The bearded man dropped his mouth open and put a dirty finger against his lower gums . For a moment he continued to look wisely , speculatively at Tom , and then he turned on his heel and popped into the shack after the gray woman . Tom turned on Pa . " What the hell was that ? " he asked . Pa shrugged his shoulders . He was looking across the camp . In front of a tent stood an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man was grinding the valves , and as he twisted back and forth , back and forth , on the tool , he looked up at the Joad truck . They could see that he was laughing to himself . When the bearded man had gone , the young man left his work and sauntered over . " H'are ya ? " he said , and his blue eyes were shiny with amusement . " I seen you just met the Mayor . " " What the hell 's the matter with ' im ? " Tom demanded . The young man chuckled . " He 's jus ' nuts like you an ' me . Maybe he 's a little nutser'n me , I don ' know . " Pa said , " I jus ' ast him if we could camp here . " The young man wiped his greasy hands on his trousers . " Sure . Why not ? You folks jus ' come acrost ? " " Yeah , " said Tom . " Jus ' got in this mornin ' . " " Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hooverville ? " " This here 's her . " " Oh ! " said Tom . " We jus ' got in . " Winfield and Ruthie came back , carrying a bucket of water between them . Ma said , " Le 's get the camp up . I 'm tuckered out . Maybe we can all rest . " Pa and Uncle John climbed up on the truck to unload the canvas and the beds . Tom sauntered to the young man , and walked beside him back to the car he had been working on . The valve-grinding brace lay on the exposed block , and a little yellow can of valve-grinding compound was wedged on top of the vacuum tank . Tom asked , " What the hell was the matter'th that of fella with the beard ? " The young man picked up his brace and went to work , twisting back and forth , grinding valve against valve seat . " The Mayor ? Christ knows . I guess maybe he 's bull-simple . " " What 's bull-simple ' ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's still spinning . " Tom asked , " Why would they push a fella like that aroun ' ? " The young man stopped his work and looked in Tom 's eyes . " Christ knows , " he said . " You jus ' come . Maybe you can figger her out . Some fellas says one thing , an ' some says another thing . But you jus ' camp in one place a little while , an ' you see how quick a deputy sheriff shoves you along . " He lifted a valve and smeared compound on the seat . " But what the hell for ? " " I tell ya I don ' know . Some says they don ' want us to vote ; keep us movin ' so we ca n't vote . An ' some says so we ca n't get on relief . An ' some says if we set in one place we'dp333get organized . I don ' know why . I on'y know we get rode all the time . You wait , you 'll see . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 're lookin ' for work . We 'll take any kind a work . " The young man paused in fitting the brace to the valve slot . He looked in amazement at Tom . " Lookin ' for work ? " he said . " So you 're lookin ' for work . What ya think ever ' - body else is lookin ' for ? Di'monds ? What you think I wore my ass down to a nub lookin ' for ? " He twisted the brace back and forth . Tom looked about at the grimy tents , the junk equipment , at the old cars , the lumpy mattresses out in the sun , at the blackened cans on fire-blackened holes where the people cooked . He asked quietly , " Ai n't they no work ? " " I don ' know . Mus ' be . Ai n't no crop right here now . Grapes to pick later , an ' cotton to pick later . We 're a-movin ' on , soon 's I get these here valves groun ' . Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard they was work up north . We 're shovin ' north , up aroun ' Salinas . " Tom saw Uncle John and Pa and the preacher hoisting the tarpaulin on the tent poles and Ma on her knees inside , brushingoff the mattresses on the ground . A circle of quiet childrenstood to watch the new family get settled , quiet chil- dren with bare feet and dirty faces . Tom said , " Back home hl some fellas come through with han'bills  --  orange ones . Says they need lots a people out here to work the crops . " The young man laughed . " They say they 's three hunderd thousan ' us folks here , an ' I bet ever ' dam ' fam'ly seen them han'bills . " " Yeah , but if they don ' need folks , what 'd they go to the trouble puttin ' them things out for ? "  | " Use your head , why don'cha ? " " Yeah , but I wanta know . " " Look , " the young man said . " S'pose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's jus ' one fella wants the job . You got to pay ' im what he asts . But s'pose they 's a hunderd men . " He put down his tool . His eyes hardened and his voice sharpened . " S'pose they 's a hunderd men wants that job . S'pose them men got kids , an ' them kids is hungry . S'pose a lousy dime 'll buy a box a mush for them kids . S'pose a nickel 'll buy at leas ' somepin for them kids . An ' you got a hunderd men . Jus ' offer ' em a nickel  --  why , they 'll kill each other fightin ' for that nickel . Know what they was payin ' , las ' job I had ? Fifteen cents an hour . Ten hours for a dollar an ' a half , an ' ya ca n't stay on the place . Got to burn gasoline gettin ' there . " He was panting with anger , and his eyes blazed with hate . " That 's why them han'bills was out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with what ya save payin ' fifteen cents an hour for fiel ' work . " Tom said , " That 's stinkin ' . " The young man laughed harshly . " You stay out here a little while , an ' if you smell any roses , you come let me smell , too . " " But they is work , " Tom insisted . with all this stuff a-growin ' : orchards , grapes , vegetables  --  I seen it . They got to have men . I seen all that stuff . " A child cried in the tent beside the car . The young man went into the tent and his voice came softly through the canvas . Tom picked up the brace , fitted it in the slot of the valve , and ground away , his hand whipping back and forth . The child 's crying stopped . The young man came out and watched Tom . " You can do her , " he said . " Damn good thing . You 'll need to . "  | " How ' bout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen all the stuff growin ' . " The young man squatted on his heels . " I worked in . Takes nine men all the year roun ' . " He paused impressively . " Takes three thousan ' men for two weeks when them peaches is ripe . Got to have ' em or them peaches 'll rot . So what do they do ? They send out han'bills all over hell . They need three thousan ' , an ' they get six thousan ' . They get them men for what they wanta pay . If ya don ' wanta take what they pay , goddamn it , they 's a thousan ' men waitin ' for your job . So ya pick , an ' ya pick , an ' then she 's done . Whole part a the country 's peaches . All ripe together . When ya get ' em picked , ever ' goddamn one is picked . There ai n't another damn thing in that part a the country to do . An ' then them owners don ' want you there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work 's done . You might steal , you might get drunk , you might jus ' raise hell . An ' besides , you don ' look nice , livin ' in of tents ; an ' it 's a pretty country , but you stink it up . They don ' want you aroun ' . So they kick you out , they move you along . That 's how it is . " Tom , looking down toward the Joad tent , saw his mother , heavy and slow with weariness , build a little trash fire and put the cooking pots over the flame . The circle of children drew closer , and the calm wide eyes of the children watched every move of Ma 's hands . An old , old man with a bent back came like a badger out of a tent and snooped near , sniffing the air as he came . He laced his arms behind him and joined the children to watch Ma . Ruthie and Winfield stood near to Ma and eyed the strangers belligerently . Tom said angrily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't they ? Jus ' when they 're ripe ? "  | " ' Course they do . " " Well , s'pose them people got together an ' says , Let ' em rot . ' Wouldn ' be long ' fore the price went up , by God ! " The young man looked up from the valves , looked sardonicallyat Tom . " Well , you figgered out somepin , didn ' you . Come right outa your own head . " " I 'm tar 'd , " said Tom . " Drove all night . I do n't wanta start no argument . An ' I 'm so goddamn tar 'd I 'd argue easy . Don ' be smart with me . I 'm askin ' you . " The young man grinned . " I didn ' mean it . You ai n't been here . Folks figgered that out . An ' the folks with the peach orchard figgered her out too . Look , if the folks gets together , they 's a leader  --  got to be  --  fella that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fella opens his mouth they grab ' im an ' stick ' im in jail . An ' if they 's another leader pops up , why , they stick ' im in jail . " Tom said , " Well , a fella eats in jail anyways . " " His kids do n't . How 'd you like to be in an ' your kids starvin ' to death ? " " Yeah , " said Tom slowly . " Yeah . " " An ' here 's another thing . Ever hear a ' the blacklist ? " " What 's that ? " " Well , you jus ' open your trap about us folks gettin ' together , an ' you 'll see . They take your pitcher an ' send it all over . Then you ca n't get work nowhere . An ' if you got kids --  " Tom took off his cap and twisted it in his hands . " So we take what we can get , huh , or we starve ; an ' if we yelp we starve . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his hand took in the ragged tents and the rusty cars . Tom looked down at his mother again , where she sat scraping potatoes . And the children had drawn closer . He said , " I ai n't gon na take it . Goddamn it , I an ' my folks ai n't no sheep . I 'll kick the hell outa somebody . " " Like a cop ? " " Like anybody . " " You 're nuts , " said the young man . " They 'll pick you right off . You got no name , no property . They 'll find you in a ditch , with the blood dried on your mouth an ' your nose . Be one little line in the paper  --  know what it 'll say ? Vagrant foun ' dead . ' An ' that 's all . You 'll see a lot of them little lines , Vagrant foun ' dead .

" He looked into the grease-streaked face . And a veil drew down over the eyes of the young man . " Nothin ' . Where you from ? " " Us ? Right near Sallisaw , Oklahoma . " " Jus ' get in ? " " Jus ' today . " " Gon na be aroun ' here long ? " " Do n't know . We 'll stay wherever we can get work . Why ? " " Nothin ' . " And the veil came down again . " Got to sleep up , " said Tom . " Tomorra we 'll go out lookin ' for work . " " You kin try . " Tom turned away and moved toward the Joad tent . The young man took up the can of valve compound and dug his finger into it . " Hi ! " he called.  | 3 8 Tom turned . " What you want ? " " I want ta tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which a blob of compound stuck . " I jus ' want ta tell ya . Don ' go lookin ' for no trouble . ' Member how that bull-simple guy looked ? " " Fella in the tent up there ? " " Yeah  --  looked dumb  --  no sense ? " " What about him ? " " Well , when the cops come in , an ' they come in all a time , that 's how you want ta be . Dumb  --  do n't know nothin ' . Do n't understan ' nothin ' . That 's how the cops like us . Do n't hit no cops . That 's jus ' suicide . Be bull-simple . " " Let them goddamn cops run over me , an ' me do nothin ' ? " " No , looka here . I 'll come for ya tonight . Maybe I 'm wrong . There 's stools aroun ' all a time . I 'm takin ' a chancet , an ' I got a kid , too . But I 'll come for ya . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're a goddamn dumb Okie , see ? " " Tha 's awright if we 're doin ' anythin ' , " said Tom . " Don ' you worry . We 're doin ' somepin , on'y we ai n't stickin ' our necks out . A kid starves quick . Two-three days for a kid . " He went back to his job , spread the compound on a valve seat , and his hand jerked rapidly back and forth on the brace , and his face was dull and dumb . Tom strolled slowly back to his camp . " Bull-simple , " he said under his breath . Pa and Uncle John came toward the camp , their arms loaded with dry willow sticks , and they threw them down by the fire and squatted on their hams . " Got her picked over pretty good , " said Pa . " Had ta go a long ways for wood . " He looked up at the circle of staring children . " Lord God Almighty ! " he said . " Where 'd you come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their feet.  | 39 " Guess they smelled the cookin ' , " said Ma . " Winfiel ' , get out from under foot . " She pushed him out of her way . " Got to make us up a little stew , " she said . " We ai n't et nothin ' cooked right sence we come from home . Pa , you go up to the store there an ' get me some neck meat . Make a nice stew here . " Pa stood up and sauntered away . Al had the hood of the car up , and he looked down at the greasy engine . He looked up when Tom approached . " You sure look happy as a buzzard , " Al said . " I 'm jus ' gay as a toad in spring rain , " said Tom . " Looka the engine , " AI pointed . " Purty good , huh ? " Tom peered in . " Looks awright to me . " Jesus , she 's wonderful . She ai n't shot no oil nor nothin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his forefingerin the hole . " Crusted up some , but she 's dry . " Tom said , " You done a nice job a pickin ' . That what ya want me to say ? " " Well , I sure was scairt the whole way , figgerin ' she 'd bust down an ' it 'd be my fault . " " No , you done good . Better get her in shape , ' cause tomorra we 're goin ' out lookin ' for work . " " She 'll roll , " said Al . " Do n't you worry none about that . " He took out a pocket knife and scraped the points of the spark plug . Tom walked around the side of the tent , and he found Casy sitting on the earth , wisely regarding one bare foot . Tom sat down heavily beside him . " Think she 's gon na work ? " " What ? " asked Casy . " Them toes of yourn . " " Oh ! Jus ' settin ' here a-thinkin ' . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Tom.  | Casy waggled his big toe up and his second toe down , and he smiled quietly . " Hard enough for a fella to think ' thout kinkin ' hisself up to do it . " " Ai n't heard a peep outa you for days , " said Tom . " Thinkin ' all the time ? " " Yeah , thinkin ' all the time . " Tom took off his cloth cap , dirty now , and ruinous , the visor pointed as a bird 's beak . He turned the sweat band out and removed a long strip of folded newspaper . " Sweat so much she 's shrank , " he said . He looked at Casy 's waving toes . " Could ya come down from your thinkin ' an ' listen a minute ? " Casy turned his head on the stalk-like neck " Listen all the time . That 's why I been thinkin ' . Listen to people a-talkin ' , an ' purty soon I hear the way folks are feelin ' . Goin ' on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel ' em ; an ' they 're beating their wings like a bird in a attic . Gon na bust their wings on a dusty winda tryin ' ta get out . " Tom regarded him with widened eyes , and then he turned and looked at a gray tent twenty feet away . Washed jeans and shirts and a dress hung to dry on the tent guys . He said softly , " That was about what I was gon na tell ya . An ' you seen awready . " " I seen , " Casy agreed . " They 's a army of us without no harness . " He bowed his head and ran his extended hand slowly up his forehead and into his hair . " All along I seen it , " he said . " Ever ' place we stopped I seen it . Folks hungry for side-meat , an ' when they get it , they ai n't fed . An ' when they 'd get so hungry they couldn ' stan ' it no more , why , they 'd ast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I done it . " He clasped his hands around drawn-up knees and pulled his legs in . " I use ta think that 'd cut ' er , " he said . " Use ta rip off ap341prayer an ' all the troubles 'd stick to that prayer like flies on flypaper , an ' the prayer 'd go a-sailin ' off , a-takin ' them troublesalong . But it don ' work no more . " Tom said , " Prayer never brought in no side-meat . Takes a shoat to bring in pork . " " Yeah , " Casy said . " An ' Almighty God never raised no wages . These here folks want to live decent and bring up their kids decent . An ' when they 're old they wanta set in the door an ' watch the downing sun . An ' when they 're young they wanta dance an ' sing an ' lay together . They wanta eat an ' get drunk and work . An ' that 's it  --  they wanta jus ' fling their goddamn muscles aroun ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ? " I du n no , " said Tom . " Sounds kinda nice . When ya think you can get to work an ' quit thinkin ' a spell ? We got to get work . Money 's ' bout gone . Pa give five dollars to get a painted piece of board stuck up over Granma . We ai n't got much lef ' . " A lean brown mongrel dog came sniffing around the side of the tent . He was nervous and flexed to run . He sniffed close before he was aware of the two men , and then looking up he saw them , leaped sideways , and fled , ears back , bony tail clamped protectively . Casy watched him go , dodging around a tent to get out of sight . Casy sighed . " I ai n't doin ' nobody no good , " he said . " Me or nobody else . I was thinkin ' I 'd go off alone by myself . I 'm a-eatin ' your food an ' a-takin ' up room . An ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could get a steady job an ' maybe pay back some a the stuff you 've give me . " Tom opened his mouth and thrust his lower jaw forward , and he tapped his lower teeth with a dried piece of mustard stalk . His eyes stared over the camp , over the gray tents and the shacks of weed and tin and paper . " Wisht I had a sack a Durham , " he said . " I ai n't had a smoke in a hell of a time . Use to get tobacco in McAlester . Almost wisht I was back . " He tapped his teeth again and suddenly he turned on the preacher . " Ever been in a jail house ? " " No , " said Casy . " Never been . " " Do n't go away right yet , " said Tom . " Not right yet . " " Quicker I get lookin ' for work  --  quicker I 'm gon na find some . " Tom studied him with half-shut eyes and he put on his cap again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't no Ian ' of milk an ' honey like the preachers say . They 's a mean thing here . The folks here is scared of us people comin ' west ; an ' so they got cops out tryin ' to scare us back . " " Yeah , " said Casy . " I know . What you ask about me bein ' in jail for ? " Tom said slowly , " When you 're in jail  --  you get to kindasensin ' stuff . Guys ai n't let to talk a hell of a lot together  --  two maybe , but not a crowd . An ' so you get kinda sensy . If somepin 's gon na bust  --  if say a fella 's goin ' stir-bugs an ' take a crack at a guard with a mop handle  --  why , you know it ' fore it happens . An ' if they 's gon na be a break or a riot , nobody do n't have to tell ya . You 're sensy about it . You know . " " Yeah ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stick aroun ' till tomorra anyways . Somepin 's gon na come up . I was talkin ' to a kid up the road . An ' he 's bein ' jus ' as sneaky an ' wise as a dog coyote , but he 's too wise . Dog coyote a-mindin ' his own business an ' innocent an ' sweet , jus ' havin ' fun an ' no harm  --  well , they 's a hen roost clost by . " Casy watched him intently , started to ask a question , and then shut his mouth tightly . He waggled his toes slowly and , releasing his knees , pushed out his foot so he could see it . " Yeah , " he said , " I wo n't go right yet . " Tom said , " When a bunch a folks , nice quiet folks , do n't know nothin ' about nothin '  --  somepin 's goin ' on . " " I 'll stay , " said Casy . " An ' tomorra we 'll go out in the truck an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Casy , and he waved his toes up and down and studied them gravely . Tom settled back on his elbow and closed his eyes . Inside the tent he could hear the murmur of Rose of Sharon 's voice and Connie 's answering . The tarpaulin made a dark shadow and the wedge-shaped light at each end was hard and sharp . Rose of Sharon lay on a mattress and Connie squatted beside her . " I ought a help Ma , " Rose of Sharon said . " I tried , but ever ' time I stirred about I throwed up . " Connie 's eyes were sullen . " If I 'd of knowed it would be like this I wouldn ' of came . I 'd a studied nights ' bout tractors back home an ' got me a three-dollar job . Fella can live awful nice on three dollars a day , an ' go to the pitcher show ever ' night , too . " Rose of Sharon looked apprehensive . " You 're gon na study nights ' bout radios , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ? " she demanded . " Yeah , sure . Soon 's I get on my feet . Get a little money . " She rolled up on her elbow . " You ai n't givin ' it up ! " " No  --  no  --  ' course not . But  --  I didn ' know they was placeslike this we got to live in . " The girl 's eyes hardened . " You got to , " she said quietly . " Sure . Sure , I know . Got to get on my feet . Get a littlemoney . Would a been better maybe to stay home an ' study'bout tractors . Three dollars a day they get , an ' pick up extra money , too . " Rose of Sharon 's eyes were calculating . When he looked down at her he saw in her eyes a measuring of him , a calculation of him . " But I 'm gon na study , " he said . " Soon 's I get on my feet . " She said fiercely , " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We ai n't gon na have this baby in no tent . " " Sure , " he said . " Soon 's I get on my feet . " He went out of the tent and looked down at Ma , crouched over the brush fire . Rose of Sharon rolled on her back and stared at the top of the tent . And then she put her thumb in her mouth for a gag and she cried silently . Ma knelt beside the fire , breaking twigs to keep the flame up under the stew kettle . The fire flared and dropped and flared and dropped . The children , fifteen of them , stood silently and watched . And when the smell of the cooking stew came to their noses , their noses crinkled slightly . The sunlight glistened on hair tawny with dust . The children were embarrassed to be there , but they did not go . Ma talked quietly to a little girl who stood inside the lusting circle . She was older than the rest . She stood on one foot , caressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her arms were clasped behind her . She watched Ma with steady small gray eyes . She suggested , " I could break up some bresh if you want me , ma'am . " Ma looked up from her work . " You want to get ast to eat , huh ? " " Yes , ma'am , " the girl said steadily . Ma slipped the twigs under the pot and the flame made a puttering sound . " Didn ' you have no breakfast ? " " No , ma'am . They ai n't no work hereabouts . Pa 's in tryin ' to sell some stuff to git gas so 's we can git ' long . "  | Ma looked up . " Didn ' none of these here have no break-fast ? " The circle of children shifted nervously and looked away from the boiling kettle . One small boy said boastfully , " I did  --  me an ' my brother did  --  an ' them two did , ' cause I seen ' em . We et good . We 're a-goin ' south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hungry . They ai n't enough here to go around . " The small boy 's lip stuck out . " We et good , " he said , and he turned and ran and dived into a tent . Ma looked after him so long that the oldest girl reminded her . " The fire 's down , ma'am . I can keep it up if you want . " Ruthie and Winfield stood inside the circle , comporting themselves with proper frigidity and dignity . They were aloof , and at the same time possessive . Ruthie turned cold and angry eyes on the little girl . Ruthie squatted down to break up the twigs for Ma . Ma lifted the kettle lid and stirred the stew with a stick . " I 'm sure glad some of you ai n't hungry . That little fella ai n't , anyways . " The girl sneered . " Oh , him ! He was a-braggin ' . High an ' mighty . If he do n't have no supper  --  know what he done ? Las ' night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , sir , I looked in whilst they was a-eatin ' an ' it was fried dough jus ' like ever'body else . " " Oh ! " And Ma looked down toward the tent where the small boy had gone . She looked back at the little girl . " How long you been in California ? " she asked . " Oh , ' bout six months . We lived in a gov'ment camp a while , an ' then we went north , an ' when we come back it was full up . That 's a nice place to live , you bet . "  | " Where 's that ? " Ma asked . And she took the sticks from Ruthie 's hand and fed the fire . Ruthie glared with hatred at the older girl . " Over by Weedpatch . Got nice toilets an ' baths , an ' you kin wash clothes in a tub , an ' they 's water right handy , good drinkin ' water ; an ' nights the folks plays music an ' Sat'dy night they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so nice . Got a place for kids to play , an ' them toilets with paper . Pull down a little jigger an ' the water comes right in the toilet ; an ' they ai n't no cops let to come look in your tent any time they want , an ' the fella runs the camp is so polite , comes a-visitin ' an ' talks an ' ai n't high an ' mighty . I wisht we could go live there again . " Ma said , " I never heard about it . I sure could use a wash tub , I tell you . " The girl went on excitedly , " Why , God Awmighty , they got hot water right in pipes , an ' you get in under a shower bath an ' it 's warm . You never seen such a place . " Ma said , " All full now , ya say ? " " Yeah . Las ' time we ast it was . " " Mus ' cost a lot , " said Ma . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money , they let you work it out  --  couple hours a week , cleanin ' up , an ' garbagecans . Stuff like that . An ' nights they 's music an ' folks talks together an ' hot water right in the pipes . You never seen nothin ' so nice . " Ma said , " I sure wisht we could go there . " Ruthie had stood all she could . She blurted fiercely , " Granma died right on top a the truck . " The girl looked questioningly at her . " Well , she did , " Ruthie said . " An ' the cor'ner got her . " She closed her lips tightly and broke up a little pile of sticks.  |p347Winfield  blinked at the boldness of the attack . " Right on the truck , " he echoed . " Cor'ner stuck her in a big basket . " Ma said , " You shush now , both of you , or you got to go away . " And she fed twigs into the fire . Down the line Al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you 're ' bout through , " he said . " Two more . " " Is they any girls in this here camp ? " " I got a wife , " said the young man . " I got no time for girls . " " I always got time for girls , " said Al . " I got no time for nothin ' else . " " You get a little hungry an ' you 'll change . " Al laughed . " Maybe . But I ai n't never changed that notion yet . " Fella I talked to while ago , he 's with you , ai n't he ? " " Yeah ! My brother Tom . Better not fool with him . He killed a fella . " " Did ? What for ? " " Fight . Fella got a knife in Tom . Tom busted ' im with a shovel . " " Did , huh ? What 'd the law do ? " " Let ' im off ' cause it was a fight , " said Al . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , he ai n't . But Tom do n't take nothin ' from nobody . " Al 's voice was very proud . " Tom , he 's quiet . But  --  look out ! " " Well  --  I talked to ' im . He didn ' soun ' mean . " " He ai n't . Jus ' as nice as pie till he 's roused , an ' then  --  look out . " The young man ground at the last valve . " Like me to he'p you get them valves set an ' the head on ? " " Sure , if you got nothin ' else to do . "  | " Ought a get some sleep , " said Al . " But , hell , I ca n't keep my han 's out of a tore-down car . Jus ' got to git in . " " Well , I 'd admire to git a hand , " said the young man . " My name 's Floyd Knowles . " " I 'm Al Joad . " " Proud to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al . " Gon na use the same gasket ? " " Got to , " said Floyd . Al took out his pocket knife and scraped at the block . ' he said . " They ai n't nothin ' I love like the guts of a engine . " " How ' bout girls ? " " Yeah , girls too ! Wisht I could tear down a Rolls an ' put her back . I looked under the hood of a Cad ' i6 one time an ' , ' you never seen nothin ' so sweet in your life ! In Sallisaw  --  an ' here 's this i6 a-standin ' in front of a restaurant , so I lifts the hood . An ' a guy comes out an ' says , What the hell you doin ' ? ' I says , Jus ' lookin ' . Ai n't she swell ? ' An ' he jus ' stands there . I do n't think he ever looked in her before . Jus ' stands there . Rich fella in a straw hat . Got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We don ' say nothin ' . Jus ' look . An ' purty soon he says , How 'd you like to drive her ? ' " Floyd said , " The hell ! " " Sure  --  ' How 'd you like to drive her ? ' Well , hell , I got on jeans  --  all dirty . I says , I 'd get her dirty . " Come on ! ' he says . Jus ' take her roun ' the block . ' Well , sir , I set in that seat an ' I took her roun ' the block eight times , an ' , oh , my God Almighty ! " " Nice ? " Floyd asked . " Oh , Jesus ! - " said Al . " If I could of tore her down why  --  I 'd a give  --  anythin ' . "  |p349Floyd  slowed his jerking arm . He lifted the last valve from its seat and looked at it . " You better git use ' to a jalopy , " he said , " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He put his brace down on the running board and took up a chisel to scrape the crust from the block . Two stocky women , bare-headed and bare-footed , went by carrying a bucket of milky water between them . They limped against the weight of the bucket , and neither one looked up from the ground . The sun was half down in afternoon . Al said , " You do n't like nothin ' much . " Floyd scraped harder with the chisel . " I been here six months , " he said . " I been scrabblin ' over this here State tryin ' to work hard enough and move fast enough to get meat an ' potatoes for me an ' my wife an ' my kids . I 've run myself like a jackrabbit an '  --  I ca n't quite make her . There just ai n't quite enough to eat no matter what I do . I 'm gettin ' tired , that 's all . I 'm gettin ' tired way past where sleep rests me . An ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ai n't there no steady work for a fella ? " Al asked . " No , they ai n't no steady work . " With his chisel he pushed the crust off the block , and he wiped the dull metal with a greasy rag . A rusty touring car drove down into the camp and there were four men in it , men with brown hard faces . The car drove slowly through the camp . Floyd called to them , " Any luck ? " The car stopped . The driver said , " We covered a hell of a lot a ground . They ai n't a hand 's work in this here country . We got ta move . " " Where to ? " Al called . " God knows . We worked this here place over . " He let in his clutch and moved slowly down the camp.  |  Al looked after them . " Wouldn ' it be better if one fella went alone ? Then if they was one piece a work , a fella 'd get it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ai n't learned , " he said . " Takes gas to get roun ' the country . Gas costs fifteen cents a gallon . Them four fellas ca n't take four cars . So each of ' em puts in a dime an ' they get gas . You got to learn . " " Al ! " Al looked down at Winfield standing importantly beside him . " AI , Ma 's dishin ' up stew . She says come git it . " Al wiped his hands on his trousers . " We ai n't et today , " he said to Floyd . " I 'll come give you a han ' when I eat . " " No need ' less you want ta . " " Sure , I 'll do it . " He followed Winfield toward the Joad camp . It was crowded now . The strange children stood close to the stew pot , so close that Ma brushed them with her elbows as she worked . Tom and Uncle John stood beside her . Ma said helplessly , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed the fambly . What 'm I gon na do with these here ? " The children stood stiffly and looked at her . Their faces were blank , rigid , and their eyes went mechanically from the pot to the tin plate she held . Their eyes followed the spoon from pot to plate , and when she passed the steaming plate up to Uncle John , their eyes followed it up . Uncle John dug his spoon into the stew , and the banked eyes rose up with the spoon . A piece of potato went into John 's mouth and the banked eyes were on his face , watching to see how he would react . Would it be good ? Would he like it ? And then Uncle John seemed to see them for the first time.  |p351He  chewed slowly . " You take this here , " he said to Tom . " I ai n't hungry . " " You ai n't et today , " Tom said . " I know , but I got a stomickache . I ai n't hungry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tent an ' you eat it . " " I ai n't hungry , " John insisted . " I 'd still see ' em inside the tent . " Tom turned on the children . " You git , " he said . " Go on now , git . " The bank of eyes left the stew and rested wonderingon his face . " Go on now , git . You ai n't doin ' no good . There ai n't enough for you . " Ma ladled stew into the tin plates , very little stew , and she laid the plates on the ground . " I ca n't send ' em away , " she said . " I don ' know what to do . Take your plates an ' go inside . I 'll let ' em have what 's lef ' . Here , take a plate in to Rosasharn . " She smiled up at the children . " Look , " she said , " you little fellas go an ' get you each a flat stick an ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ai n't to be no fightin ' . " The group broke up with a deadly , silent swiftness . Children ran to find sticks , they ran to their own tents and brought spoons . Before Ma had finished with the plates they were back , silent and wolfish . Ma shook her head . " I du n no what to do . I ca n't rob the fambly . I got to feed the fambly . Ruthie , Winfiel ' , Al , " she cried fiercely . " Take your plates . Hurry up . Git in the tent quick . " She looked apologetically at the waiting children . " There ai n't enough , " she said humbly . " I 'm a-gonna set this here kettle out , an ' you 'll all get a little tas ' , but it ai n't gon na do you no good . " She faltered , " I ca n't he'p it . Ca n't keep it from you . " She lifted the pot and set it down on the ground . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she went into the tent quickly so she would not see . Her family sat on the ground , each with his plate ; and outside they could hear the children digging into the pot with their sticks and their spoons and their pieces of rusty tin . A mound of children smothered the pot from sight . They did not talk , did not fight or argue ; but there was a quiet intentness in all of them , a wooden fierceness . Ma turned her back so she could n't see . " We ca n't do that no more , " she said . " We got to eat alone . " There was the sound of scraping at the kettle , and then the mound of children broke and the children walked away and left the scraped kettle on the ground . Ma looked at the empty plates . " Didn ' none of you get nowhere near enough . " Pa got up and left the tent without answering . The preacher smiled to himself and lay back on the ground , hands clasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Got to help a fella with a car . " Ma gathered the plates and took them outside to wash . " Ruthie , " she called , " Winfiel ' . Go get me a bucket a water right off . " She handed them the bucket and they trudged off toward the river . A strong broad woman walked near . Her dress was streaked with dust and splotched with car oil . Her chin was held high with pride . She stood a short distance away and regarded Ma belligerently . At last she approached . " Afternoon , " she said coldly . " Afternoon , " said Ma , and she got up from her knees and pushed a box forward . " Wo n't you set down ? " The woman walked near . " No , I wo n't set down . " Ma looked questioningly at her . " Can I he'p you in any way ? "  |p353The  woman set her hands on her hips . " You kin he'p me by mindin ' your own childern an ' lettin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ai n't done nothin '  --  " she began . The woman scowled at her . " My little fella come back smellin ' of stew . You give it to ' im . He tol ' me . Don ' you go a-boastin ' an ' a-braggin " bout havin ' stew . Don ' you do it . I got ' nuf troubles ' thout that . Come in to me , he did , an ' says , Why n't we have stew ? ' " Her voice shook with fury . Ma moved close . " Set down , " she said . " Set down an ' talk a piece . " " No , I ai n't gon na set down . I 'm tryin ' to feed my folks , an ' you come along with your stew . " " Set down , " Ma said . " That was ' bout the las ' stew we 're gon na have till we get work . S'pose you was cookin ' a stew an ' a bunch a little fellas stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We did n't have enough , but you ca n't keep it when they look at va like that . " The woman 's hands dropped from her hips . For a moment her eyes questioned Ma , and then she turned and walked quickly away , and she went into a tent and pulled the flaps down behind her . Ma stared after her , and then she dropped to her knees again beside the stack of tin dishes . Al hurried near . " Tom , " he called . " Ma , is Tom inside ? " Tom stuck his head out . " What you want ? " " Come on with me , " Al said excitedly . They walked away together . " What 's a matter with you ? " Tom asked . " You 'll find out . Jus ' wait . " He led Tom to the torn-down car . " This here 's Floyd Knowles , " he said . " Yeah , I talked to him . How ya ? " " Jus ' gettin ' her in shape , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of the block . " What kinda bugs is crawlin ' on you , Al ? " " Floyd jus ' tol ' me . Tell ' em , Floyd . " Floyd said , " Maybe I shouldn ' , but  --  yeah , I 'll tell ya . Fella come through an ' he says they 's gon na be work up north . " " Up north ? " " Yeah  --  place called Santa Clara Valley , way to hell an ' gone up north . " " Yeah ? Kinda work ? " " Prune pickin ' , an ' pears an ' cannery work . Says it 's putty near ready . " " How far ? " Tom demanded . " Oh God knows . Maybe two hundred miles . " " That 's a hell of a long ways , " said Tom . " How we know they 's gon na be work when we get there ? " " Well , we don ' know , " said Floyd . " But they ai n't nothin ' here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brother , an ' he 's on his way . He says not to tell nobody , they 'll be too many . We ought a get out in the night . Ought a get there an ' get some work lined up . " Tom studied him . " Why we got ta sneak away ? " " Well , if ever'body gets there , ai n't gon na be work for nobody . " " It 's a hell of a long ways , " Tom said . Floyd sounded hurt . " I 'm jus ' givin ' you the tip . You don ' have to take it . Your brother here he'ped me , an ' I 'm givin ' you the tip . " " You sure there ai n't no work here ? " " Look , I been scourin ' aroun ' for three weeks all over hell , an ' I ai n't had a bit a work , not a single han ' - holt . ' F you wanta look aroun ' an ' burn up gas lookin ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . More that goes , the less chance I got . "  | 5 5Tom said , " I ai n't findin ' fault . It 's jus ' such a hell of a long ways . An ' we kinda hoped we could get work here an ' rent a house to live in . " Floyd said patiently , " I know ya jus ' got here . They 's stuff ya got to learn . If you 'd let me tell ya , it 'd save ya somepin . If ya don ' let me tell ya , then ya got to learn the hard way . You ai n't gon na settle down ' cause they ai n't no work to settle ya . An ' your belly ai n't gon na let ya settle down . Now  --  that 's straight . " " Wisht I could look aroun ' first , " Tom said uneasily . A sedan drove through the camp and pulled up at the next tent . A man in overalls and a blue shirt climbed out . Floyd called to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a hap ' - turn of work in the whole darn country , not till cotton pickin ' . " And he went into the ragged tent . " See ? " said Floyd . " Yeah , I see . But two hunderd miles , jesus ' " Well , you ai n't settlin ' down no place for a while . Might 's well make up your mind to that . " " We better go , " Al said . Tom asked , " When is they gon na be work aroun ' here ? " " Well , in a month the cotton 'll start . If you got plenty money you can wait for the cotton . " Tom said , " Ma ai n't a-gonna wanta move . She 's all tar 'd out . " Floyd shrugged his shoulders . " I ai n't a-tryin ' to push ya north . Suit yaself . I jus ' tol ' ya what I heard . " He picked the oily gasket from the running board and fitted it carefully on the block and pressed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " ' f you want to give me a han ' with that engine head . " Tom watched while they set the heavy head gently down over the head bolts and dropped it evenly . " Have to talk about it , " he said . Floyd said , " I do n't want nobody but your folks to know about it . Jus ' you . An ' I would n't of tol ' you if ya brother didn ' he'p me out here . " Tom said , " Well , I sure thank ya for tellin ' us . We got to figger it out . Maybe we 'll go . " Al said , " By God , I think I 'll go if the res ' goes or not . I 'll hitch there . " " An ' leave the fambly ? " Tom asked . " Sure . I 'd come back with my jeans plumb fulla jack . Why not ? " " Ma ai n't gon na like no such thing , " Tom said . " An ' Pa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Floyd set the nuts and screwed them down as far as he could with his fingers . " Me an ' my wife come out with our folks , " he said . " Back home we wouldn ' of thought of goin ' away . Wouldn ' of thought of it . But , hell , we was all up north a piece and I come down here , an ' they moved on , an ' now God knows where they are . Been lookin ' an ' askin ' about ' em ever since . " He fitted his wrench to the engineheadbolts and turned them down evenly , one turn to each nut , around and around the series . Tom squatted down beside the car and squinted his eyes up the line of tents . A little stubble was beaten into the earth between the tents . " No , sir , " he said , " Ma ai n't gon na like you goin ' off . " " Well , seems to me a lone fella got more chance of work . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it at all . " Two cars loaded with disconsolate men drove down into the camp . Floyd lifted his eyes , but he did n't ask them aboutp357their luck . Their dusty faces were sad and resistant . The sun was sinking now , and the yellow sunlight fell on the Hoovervilleand on the willows behind it . The children began to come out of the tents , to wander about the camp . And from the tents the women came and built their little fires . The men gathered in squatting groups and talked together . A new Chevrolet coupe turned off the highway and headed down into the camp . It pulled to the center of the camp . Tom said , " Who 's this ? They do n't belong here . " Floyd said , " I du n no  --  cops , maybe . " The car door opened and a man got out and stood beside the car . His companion remained seated . Now all the squattingmen looked at the newcomers and the conversation was still . And the women building their fires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer with elaborate circuitousness , edging inward in long curves . Floyd put down his wrench . Tom stood up . Al wiped his hands on his trousers . The three strolled toward the Chevrolet . The man who had got out of the car was dressed in khaki trousers and a flannel shirt . He wore a flat-brimmed Stetson hat . A sheaf of papers was held in his shirt pocket by a little fence of fountain pens and yellow pencils ; and from his hip pocket protruded a notebook with metal covers . He moved to one of the groups of squatting men , and they looked up at him , suspicious and quiet . They watched him and did not move ; the whites of their eyes showed beneath the irises , for they did not raise their heads to look . Tom and AI and Floyd strolled casually near . The man said , " You men want to work ? " Still they looked quietly , suspiciously . And men from all over the camp moved near.  |p358One  of the squatting men spoke at last . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work ? " " Tulare County . Fruit 's opening up . Need a lot of pickers . " Floyd spoke up . " You doin ' the hiring ? " " Well , I 'm contracting the land . " The men were in a compact group now . An overalled man took off his black hat and combed back his long black hair with his fingers . " What you payin ' ? " he asked . " Well , ca n't tell exactly , yet . ' Bout thirty cents , I guess . " " Why ca n't you tell ? You took the contract , didn ' you ? " " That 's true , " the khaki man said . " But it 's keyed to theprice . Might be a little more , might be a little less . " Floyd stepped out ahead . He said quietly , " I 'll go , mister . You 're a contractor , an ' you got a license . You jus ' show your license , an ' then you give us an order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when , an ' how much we 'll get , an ' you sign that , an ' we 'll all go . " The contractor turned , scowling . " You telling me how to run my own business ? " Floyd said , " ' F we 're workin ' for you , it 's our business too . " " Well , you ai n't telling me what to do . I told you I need men . " Floyd said angrily , " You didn ' say how many men , an ' you didn ' say what you 'd pay . " " Goddamn it , I do n't know yet . " " If you don ' know , you got no right to hire men . " " I got a right to run my business my own way . If you men want to sit here on your ass , O.K. I 'm out getting men for Tulare County . Going to need a lot of men . " Floyd turned to the crowd of men . They were standing up now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Twicet now I 've fell for that . Maybe he needs a thousan ' men . He 'll get five thousan ' there , an ' he 'll pay fifteen cents an hour . An ' you poor bastards 'll have to take it ' cause you 'll be hungry . ' F he wants to hire men , let him hire ' em an ' write it out an ' say what he 's gon na pay . Ast to see his license . He ai n't allowed to contract men without a license . " The contractor turned to the Chevrolet and called , " Joe ! " His companion looked out and then swung the car door open and stepped out . He wore riding breeches and laced boots . A heavy pistol holster hung on a cartridge belt around his waist . On his brown shirt a deputy sheriff 's star was pinned . He walked heavily over . His face was set to a thin smile . " What you want ? " The holster slid back and forth on his hip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The deputy asked " Which one ? " " This fella . " The contractor pointed to Floyd . " What 'd he do ? " The deputy smiled at Floyd . " He 's talkin ' red , agitating trouble . " " Hm-m-m . " The deputy moved slowly around to see Floyd 's profile , and the color slowly flowed up Floyd 's face . " You see ? " Floyd cried . " If this guy 's on the level , would he bring a cop along ? " " Ever see ' im before ? " the contractor insisted . " Hmm , seems like I have . Las ' week when that used-car lot was busted into . Seems like I seen this fella hangin ' aroun ' . Yep ! I 'd swear it 's the same fella . " Suddenly the smile left his face . " Get in that car , " he said , and he unhooked the strap that covered the butt of his automatic . Tom said , " You got nothin ' on him . "  |p36o  The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go in too , you jus ' open your trap once more . They was two fellas hangin ' around that lot . " " I was n't even in the State las ' week , " Tom said . " Well , maybe you 're wanted someplace else . You keep your trap shut . " The contractor turned back to the men . " You fellas do n't want to listen to these goddamn reds . Troublemakers  --  they 'll get you in trouble . Now I can use all of you in Tulare County . " The men did n't answer . The deputy turned back to them . " Might be a good idear to go , " he said . The thin smile was back on his face . " Board of Health says we got to clean out this camp . An ' if it gets around that you got reds out here  --  why , somebody might git hurt . Be a good idear if all you fellas moved on to Tulare . They is n't a thing to do aroun ' here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Be a bunch a guys down here , maybe with pick handles , if you ai n't gone . " The contractor said , " I told you I need men . If you do n't want to work  --  well , that 's your business . " The deputy smiled . " If they do n't want to work , they ai n't a place for ' em in this county . We 'll float ' em quick . " Floyd stood stiffly beside the deputy , and Floyd 's thumbs were hooked over his belt . Tom stole a look at him , and then stared at the ground . " That 's all , " the contractor said . " There 's men needed in Tulare County ; plenty of work . " Tom looked slowly up at Floyd 's hands , and he saw the strings at the wrists standing out under the skin . Tom 's own hands came up , and his thumbs hooked over his belt.  | " Yeah , that 's all . I do n't want one of you here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chevrolet . " Nov , you , " the deputy said to Floyd , " you get in that car . " He reached a large hand up and took hold of Floyd 's left arm . Floyd spun and swung with one movement . His fist splashed into the large face , and in the same motion he was away , dodging down the line of tents . The deputy staggered and Tom put out his foot for him to trip over . The deputy fell heavily and rolled , reaching for his gun . Floyd dodged in and out of sight down the line . The deputy fired from the ground . A woman in front of a tent screamed and then looked at a hand which had no knuckles . The fingers hung on strings against her palm , and the torn flesh was white and bloodless . Far down the line Floyd came in sight , sprinting for the willows . The deputy , sitting on the ground , raised his gun again and then , suddenly , from the group of men , the Reverend Casy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then stood back as the heavy man crumpled into unconsciousness . The motor of the Chevrolet roared and it streaked away , churning the dust . It mounted to the highway and shot away . In front of her tent , the woman still looked at her shattered hand . Little droplets of blood began to ooze from the wound . And a chuckling hysteria began in her throat , a whining laugh that grew louder and higher with each breath . The deputy lay on his side , his mouth open against the dust . Tom picked up his automatic , pulled out the magazine and threw it into the brush , and he ejected the live shell from the chamber . " Fella like that ai n't got no right to a gun , " he said ; and he dropped the automatic to the ground . A crowd had collected around the woman with the broken hand , and her hysteria increased , a screaming quality came into her laughter . Casy moved close to Tom . " You got to git out , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He didn ' see me kick ' im , but he seen you stick out your foot . " " I don ' want to go , " Tom said . Casy put his head close . He whispered , " They 'll fingerprintyou . You broke parole . They 'll send you back . " Torn drew in his breath quietly . I forgot . " " Go quick , " Casy said . " ' Fore he comes to . " " Like to have his gun , " Tom said . " No . Leave it . If it 's awright to come back , I 'll give ya four high whistles . " Tom strolled away casually , but as soon as he was away from the group he hurried his steps , and he disappeared among the willows that lined the river . Al stepped over to the fallen deputy . " " he said admiringly , " you sure flagged ' im down ! " The crowd of men had continued to stare at the unconscious man . And now in the great distance a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screamed again , nearer this time . Instantly the men were nervous . They shifted their feet for a moment and then they moved away , each one to his own tent . Only Al and the preacher remained . Casy turned to Al . " Get out , " he said . " Go on , get out  --  to the tent . You do n't know nothin ' . " " Yeah ? How ' bout you ? " Casy grinned at him . " Somebody got to take the blame . Ip363got no kids . They 'll jus ' put me in jail , an ' I ai n't doin ' nothin ' but set aroun ' . " Al said , " Ai n't no reason for --  " " Go on now , " Casy said sharply . " You get outa this . " Al bristled . " I ai n't takin ' orders . " Casy said softly , " If you mess in this your whole fambly , all your folks , gon na get in trouble . I don ' care about you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get in trouble . Maybe they 'll send Tom back to McAlester . " Al considered it for a moment . " O.K. , " he said . " I think you 're a damn fool , though . " " Sure , " said Casy . " Why not ? " The siren screamed again and again , and always it came closer . Casy knelt beside the deputy and turned him over . The man groaned and fluttered his eyes , and he tried to see . Casy wiped the dust off his lips . The families were in the tents now , and the flaps were down , and the setting sun made the air red and the gray tents bronze . Tires squealed on the highway and an open car came swiftly into the camp . Four men , armed with rifles , piled out . Casy stood up and walked to them . " What the hell 's goin ' on here ? " Casy said , " I knocked out your man there . " One of the armed men went to the deputy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now what happened here ? " " Well , " Casy said , " he got tough an ' I hit ' im , and he started shootin '  --  hit a woman down the line . So I hit ' im again . " " Well , what 'd you do in the first place ? " " I talked back , " said Casy . " Get in that car . "  | " Sure , " said Casy , and he climbed into the back seat and sat down . Two men helped the hurt deputy to his feet . He felt his neck gingerly . Casy said , " They 's a woman down the row like to bleed to death from his bad shootin ' . " " We 'll see about that later . Mike . is this the fella that hit you ? " The dazed man stared sickly at Casy . " Do n't look like him . " " It was me , all right , " Casy said . " You got smart with the wrong fella . " Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the right fella to me . By God , I 'm gon na be sick ! " Casy said , " I 'll go ' thout no trouble . You better see how bad that woman 's hurt . " " Where 's she ? " " That tent over there . " The leader of the deputies walked to the tent , rifle in hand . He spoke through the tent walls , and then went inside . In a moment he came out and walked back . And he said , a little proudly , what a mess a .45 does make ! They got a tourniquet on . We 'll send a doctor out . " Two deputies sat on either side of Casy . The leader sounded his horn . There was no movement in the camp . The flaps were down tight , and the people in their tents . The engine started and the car swung around and pulled out of the camp . Between his guards Casy sat proudly , his head up and the stringy muscles of his neck prominent . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face a curious look of conquest . When the deputies had gone , the people came out of the tents . The sun was down now , and the gentle blue evening light was in the camp . To the east the mountains were stillp365yellow with sunlight . The women went back to the fires that had died . The men collected to squat together and to talk softly . Al crawled from under the Joad tarpaulin and walked toward the willows to whistle for Tom . Ma came out and built her little fire of twigs . " Pa , " she said , " we ai n't goin ' to have much . We et so late . " Pa and Uncle John stuck close to the camp , watching Ma peeling potatoes and slicing them raw into a frying pan of deep grease . Pa said , " Now what the hell made the preacher do that ? " Ruthie and Winfield crept close and crouched down to hear the talk . Uncle John scratched the earth deeply with a long rusty nail . " He knowed about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tol ' me ; but I don ' know if he 's right . He says a fella 's sinned if he thinks he 's sinned . " Uncle John 's eyes were tired and sad . " I been secret all my days , " he said . " I done things I never tol ' about . " Ma turned from the fire . " Don ' go tellin ' , John , " she said . " Tell ' em to God . Don ' go burdenin ' other people with your sins . That ai n't decent . " " They 're a-eatin ' on me , " said John . " Well , don ' tell ' em . Go down the river an ' stick your head under an ' whisper ' em in the stream . " Pa nodded his head slowly at Ma 's words . " She 's right , " he said . " It gives a fella relief to tell , but it jus ' spreads out his sin . " Uncle John looked up to the sun-gold mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wisht I could run it down , " he said . " But I ca n't . She 's a-bitin ' in my guts . "  | Behind him Rose of Sharon moved dizzily out of the tent . " Where 's Connie ? " she asked irritably . " I ai n't seen Connie for a long time . Where 'd he go ? " " I ai n't seen him , " said Ma . " If I see ' im , I 'll tell ' im you want ' im . " " I ai n't feelin ' good , " said Rose of Sharon . " Connie shouldn ' of left me . " Ma looked up to the girl 's swollen face . " You been a-cryin ' , " she said . The tears started freshly in Rose of Sharon 's eyes . Ma went on firmly , " You git aholt on yaself . They 's a lot of us here . You git aholt on yaself . Come here now an ' peel some potatoes . You 're feelin ' sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the tent . She tried to avoid Ma 's stern eyes , but they compelled her and she came slowly toward the fire . " He shouldn ' of went away , " she said , but the tears were gone . " You got to work , " Ma said . " Set in the tent an ' you 'll get feelin ' sorry about yaself . I ai n't had time to take you in han ' . I will now . You take this here knife an ' get to them potatoes . " The girl knelt down and obeyed . She said fiercely , " Wait 'll I see ' im . I 'll tell ' im . " Ma smiled slowly . " He might smack you . You got it comin ' with whinin ' aroun ' an ' candyin ' yaself . If he smacks some sense in you I 'll bless ' im . " The girl 's eyes blazed with resentment , but she was silent . Uncle John pushed his rusty nail deep into the ground with his broad thumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pa said , " Well , tell then , goddamn it ! Who 'd ya kill ? " Uncle John dug with his thumb into the watch pocket ofp367his blue jeans and scooped out a folded dirty bill . He spread it out and showed it . " Fi ' dollars , " he said . " Steal her ? " Pa asked . " No , I had her . Kept her out . " " She was yourn , was n't she ? " " Yeah , but I did n't have no right to keep her out . " " I do n't see much sin in that , " Ma said . " It 's yourn . " Uncle John said slowly , " It ai n't only the keepin ' her out . I kep ' her out to get drunk . I knowed they was gon na come a time when I got to get drunk , when I 'd get to hurtin ' inside so I got to get drunk . Figgered time wasn ' yet , an ' then  --  the preacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Pa nodded his head up and down and cocked his head to hear . Ruthie moved closer , like a puppy , crawling on her elbows , and Winfield followed her . Rose of Sharon dug at a deep eye in a potato with the point of her knife . The evening light deepened and became more blue . Ma said , in a sharp matter-of-fact tone , " I don ' see why him savin ' Tom got to get you drunk . " John said sadly , " Ca n't say her . I feel awful . He done her so easy . Jus ' stepped up there an ' says , I done her . ' An ' they took ' im away . An ' I 'm a-gonna get drunk . " Pa still nodded his head . " I do n't see why you got to tell , " he said . " If it was me , I 'd jus ' go off an ' get drunk if I had to . " " Come a time when I could a did somepin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Uncle John said sadly . " An ' I slipped up . I didn ' jump on her , an '  --  an ' she got away . Lookie ! " he said . " You got the money . Gim me two dollars . " Pa reached reluctantly into his pocket and brought out the leather pouch . " You ai n't gon na need no seven dollars to get drunk . You do n't need to drink champagny water . "  | Uncle John held out his bill . " You take this here an ' gim me two dollars . I can get good an ' drunk for two dollars . I don ' want no sin of waste on me . I 'll spend whatever I got . Always do . " Pa took the dirty bill and gave Uncle John two silver dollars . " There ya are , " he said . " A fella got to do what he got to do . Nobody don ' know enough to tell ' im . " Uncle John took the coins . " You ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ? " yes , " said Pa . " You know what you got to do . " " I wouldn ' be able to get through this night no other way , " he said . He turned to Ma . " You ai n't gon na hold her over me ? " Ma did n't look up . " No , " she said softly . " No  --  you go ' long . " He stood up and walked forlornly away in the evening . He walked up to the concrete highway and across the pavement to the grocery store . In front of the screen door he took off his hat , dropped it into the dust , and ground it with his heel in self-abasement . And he left his black hat there , broken and dirty . He entered the store and walked to the shelves where the whisky bottles stood behind wire netting . Pa and Ma and the children watched Uncle John move away . Rose of Sharon kept her eyes resentfully on the potatoes . " Poor John , " Ma said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good if  --  no  --  I guess not . I never seen a man so drove . " Ruthie turned on her side in the dust . She put her head close to Winfield 's head and pulled his ear against her mouth . She whispered , " I 'm gon na get drunk . " Winfield snorted and pinched his mouth tight . The two children crawled away , holding their breath , their faces purple with the pres/sure of their giggles . They crawled around the tent and leaped up and ran squealing away from the tent . They ran to the willows , and once concealed , they shrieked with laughter . Ruthie crossed her eyes and loosened her joints ; she staggered about , tripping loosely , with her tongue hanging out . " I 'm drunk , " she said . " Look , " Winfield cried . " Looka me , here 's me , an ' I 'm Uncle John . " He flapped his arms and puffed , he whirled until he was dizzy . " No , " said Ruthie . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm Uncle John . I 'm awful drunk . " Al and Tom walked quietly through the willows , and they came on the children staggering crazily about . The dusk was thick now . Tom stopped and peered . " Ai n't that Ruthie an ' Winfiel ' ? What the hell 's the matter with ' em ? " They walked nearer . " You crazy ? " Tom asked . The children stopped , embarrassed . " We was  --  jus ' playin ' , " Ruthie said . " It 's a crazy way to play , " said Al . Ruthie said pertly , " It ai n't no crazier'n a lot of things . " Al walked on . He said to Tom , " Ruthie 's workin ' up a kick in the pants . She been workin ' it up a long time . ' Bout due for it . " Ruthie mushed her face at his back , pulled out her mouth with her forefingers , slobbered her tongue at him , outraged him in every way she knew , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looked at Winfield again to start the game , but it had been spoiled . They both knew it . " Le 's go down the water an ' duck our heads , " Winfield suggested . They walked down through the willows , and they were angry at Al . Al and Tom went quietly in the dusk . Tom said , " Casy 70 shouldn ' of did it . I might of knew , though . He was talkin ' how he ai n't done nothin ' for us . He 's a funny fella , Al . All the time thinkin ' . ' " Comes from bein ' a preacher , " Al said . " They get all messed up with stuff . " " Where ya s'pose Connie was a-goin ' ? " " Goin ' to take a crap , I guess . " " Well , he was goin ' a hell of a long way . " They walked among the tents , keeping close to the walls . At Floyd 's tent a soft hail stopped them . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Floyd raised the canvas a little . " You gettin ' out ? ' Tom said , " I don ' know . Think we better ? " Floyd laughed sourly . " You heard what that bull said . They 'll burn ya out if ya do n't . ' F you think that guy 's gon na take a beatin ' ' thout gettin ' back , you 're nuts . The pool-room boys 'll be down here tonight to burn us out . " " Guess we better git , then , " Tom said . " Where you a-goin ' ? " " Why , up north , like I said . " Al said , " Look , a fella tol ' me ' bout a gov'ment camp near here . Where 's it at ? " " Oh , I think that 's full up . " " Well , where 's it at ? " " Go south on 99 ' bout twelve-fourteen miles , an ' turn east to Weedpatch . It 's right near there . But I think she 's full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al said . " Sure , she 's nice . Treat ya like a man ' stead of a dog . Ai n't no cops there . But she 's full up . " Tom said , " What I ca n't understan 's why that cop was sop371mean . Seemed like he was aimin ' for trouble ; seemed like he 's pokin ' a fella to make trouble . " Floyd said , " I don ' know about here , but up north I knowed one a them fellas , an ' he was a nice fella . He tol ' me up there the deputies got to take guys in . Sheriff gets seventyfivecents a day for each prisoner , an ' he feeds ' em for a quarter . If he ai n't got prisoners , he do n't make no profit . This fella says he didn ' pick up nobody for a week , an ' the sheriff tol ' ' im he better bring in guys or give up his button . This fella today sure looks like he 's out to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to get on , " said Tom . " So long , Floyd . " " So long . Prob'ly see you . Hope so . " " Good-by , " said Al . They walked through the dark gray camp to the Joad tent . The frying pan of potatoes was hissing and spitting over the fire . Ma moved the thick slices about with a spoon . Pa sat near by , hugging his knees . Rose of Sharon was sitting under the tarpaulin . " It 's Tom ! " Ma cried . " Thank God . " " We got to get outa here , " said Tom . " What 's the matter now ? " " Well , Floyd says they 'll burn the camp tonight . " " What the hell for ? " Pa asked . " We ai n't done nothin ' . " " Nothin " cept beat up a cop , " said Tom . " Well , we never done it . " " From what that cop said , they wanta push us along . " Rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yeah , " said Al . " Way to hell an ' gone up the river . He 's goin ' south . " " - Was  --  was he goin ' away ? "   " I don ' know . " Ma turned on the girl . " Rosasharn , you been talkin ' an ' actin ' funny . What 'd Connie say to you ? " Rose of Sharon said sullenly , " Said it would a been a good thing if he stayed home an ' studied up tractors . " They were very quiet . Rose of Sharon looked at the fire and her eyes glistened in the firelight . The potatoes hissed sharply in the frying pan . The girl sniffled and wiped her nose with the back of her hand . Pa said , " Connie wasn ' no good . I seen that a long time . Didn ' have no guts , jus ' too big for his overhalls . " Rose of Sharon got up and went into the tent . She lay down on the mattress and rolled over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms . " Wouldn ' do no good to catch ' im , I guess , " Al said . Pa replied , " No . If he ai n't no good , we don ' want him . " Ma looked into the tent , where Rose of Sharon lay on her mattress . Ma said , " Sh . Don ' say that . " " Well , he ai n't no good , " Pa insisted . " All the time a-sayin ' what he 's a-gonna do . Never doin ' nothin ' . I didn ' want to say nothin ' while he 's here . But now he 's run out --  " " Sh ! " Ma said softly . " Why , for Christ 's sake ? Why do I got to shh ? He run out , didn ' he ? " Ma turned over the potatoes with her spoon , and the grease boiled and spat . She fed twigs to the fire , and the flames laced up and lighted the tent . Ma said , " Rosasharn gon na have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

You wouldn ' say no bad things about Connie if he 's dead . " Tom broke in , " Hey , what is this ? We ai n't sure Connie 's gone for good . We got no time for talkin ' . We got to eat ' an ' get on our way . " " On our way ? We jus ' come here . " Ma peered at him through the firelighted darkness . He explained carefully , " They gon na burn the camp tonight , Ma . Now you know I ai n't got it in me to stan ' by an ' see our stuff burn up , nor Pa ai n't got it in him , nor Uncle John . We 'd come up a-fightin ' , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an ' mugged . I nearly got it today , if the preacher hadn ' jumped in . " Ma had been turning the frying potatoes in the hot grease . Now she took her decision . " Come on ! " she cried . " Le 's eat this stuff . We got to go quick . " She set out the tin plates . Pa said , " How ' bout John ? " " Where is Uncle John ? " Tom asked . Pa and Ma were silent for a moment , and then Pa said , " He went to get drunk . " " " Tom said . " What a time he picked out ! Where 'd he go ? " " I don ' know , " said Pa . Tom stood up . " Look , " he said , " you all eat an ' get the stuff loaded . I 'll go look for Uncle John . He 'd of went to the store ' crost the road . " Tom walked quickly away . The little cooking fires burned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light fell on the faces of ragged men and women , on crouched children . In a few tents the light of kerosene lamps shone through the canvas and placed shadows of people hugely on the cloth .   74 Tom walked up the dusty road and crossed the concrete highway to the little grocery store . He stood in front of the screen door and looked in . The proprietor , a little gray man with an unkempt mustache and watery eyes , leaned on the counter reading a newspaper . His thin arms were bare and he wore a long white apron . Heaped around and in back of him were mounds , pyramids , walls of canned goods . He looked up when Tom came in , and his eyes narrowed as though he aimed a shotgun . " Good evening , " he said . " Run out of something ? " " Run out of my uncle , " said Tom , " Or he run out , or something . " The gray man looked puzzled and worried at the same time . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around to stop an itch . " Seems like you people always lost somebody , " he said . " Ten times a day or more somebody comes in here an ' says , If you see a man named so an ' so , an ' looks like so an ' so , will you tell ' im we went up north ? ' Somepin like that all the time . " Tom laughed . " Well , if you see a young snot-nose name ' Connie , looks a little hit like a coyote , tell ' im to go to hell . We 've went south . But he ai n't the fella I 'm lookin ' for . Did a fella ' bout sixty years or , black pants , sort of grayish hair , come in here an ' get some whisky ? " The eyes of the gray man brightened . " Now he sure did . I never seen anything like it . He stood out front an ' he dropped his hat an ' stepped on it . Here , I got his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from under the counter . Tom took it from him . " That 's him , all right . " " Well , sir , he got couple pints of whisky an ' he didn ' say a thing . He pulled the cork an ' tipped up the bottle . I ai n't got a license to drink here . I says , Look , you ca n't drink here . You got to go outside . ' Well , sir ! He jus ' stepped outside the door , an ' I bet he did n't tilt up that pint more'n four times till it was empty . He throwed it away an ' he leaned in the door . Eyes kinda dull . He says , Thank you , sir , ' an ' he went on . I never seen no drinkin ' like that in my life . " " Went on ? Which way ? I got to get him . " " Well , it so happens I can tell you . I never seen such drinkin ' , so I looked out after him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come along an ' lighted him up , an ' he went down the bank . Legs was beginnin ' to buckle a little . He got the other pint open awready . He wo n't be far  --  not the way he was goin ' . " Tom said , " Thank ya . I got to find him . " " You want to take his hat ? " " Yeah ! Yeah ! He 'll need it . Well , thank ya . " " What 's the matter with him ? " the gray man asked . " He was n't takin ' pleasure in his drink . " " Oh , he 's kinda  --  moody . Well , good night . An ' if you see that squirt Connie , tell ' im we 've went south . " " I got so many people to look out for an ' tell stuff to , I ca n't ever remember ' em all . " " Do n't put yourself out too much , " Tom said . He went out the screen door carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concrete road and walked along the edge of it . Below him in the sunken field , the Hooverville lay ; and the little fires flickered and the lanterns shone through the tents . Somewhere in the camp a guitar sounded , slow chords , struck without any sequence , practice chords . Tom stopped and listened , and then he moved slowly along the side of the road , and every few steps he stopped to listen again . He had gone a quarter of a mile before he heard what he listened for . Down below the embankment the sound of a thick , tuneless voice , singing drably . Tom cocked his head , the better to hear . And the dull voice sang , " I 've give my heart to Jesus , so Jesus take me home . I 've give my soul to Jesus , so Jesus is my home . " The song trailed off to a murmur , and then stopped . Tom hurried down from the embankment , toward the song . After a while he stopped and listened again . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tuneless singing , " Oh , the night that Maggie died , she called me to her side , an ' give to me them of red flannel drawers that Maggie wore . They was baggy at the knees --  " Tom moved cautiously forward . He saw the black form sitting on the ground , and he stole near and sat down . Uncle John tilted the pint and the liquor gurgled out of the neck of the bottle . Tom said quietly , " Hey , wait ! Where do I come in ? " Uncle John turned his head . " Who you ? " " You forgot me awready ? You had four drinks to my one . " " No , Tom . Don ' try fool me . I 'm all alone here . You ai n't been here . " " Well , I 'm sure here now . How ' bout givin ' me a snort ? " Uncle John raised the pint again and the whisky gurgled . He shook the bottle . It was empty . " No more , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die awful . Die a little bit . Got to . Like sleepin ' . Die a little bit . So tar 'd . Tar 'd . Maybe  --  don ' wake up no more . " His voice crooned off . " Gon na wear a crown  --  a golden crown . " Tom said , " Listen here to me , Uncle John . We 're gon na move on . You come along , an ' you can go right to sleep up on the load . "  |p377John  shook his head . " No . Go on . Ai n't goin ' . Gon na res ' here . No good goin ' back . No good to nobody  --  jus ' adraggin ' my sins like dirty drawers ' mongst nice folks . No . Ai n't goin ' . " " Come on . We ca n't go ' less you go . " " Go ri ' ' long . I ai n't no good . I ai n't no good . Jus ' adraggin ' my sins , a-dirtyin ' ever'body . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John put his head close , and he winked one eye wisely . Tom could see his face dimly in the starlight . " Nobody don ' know my sins , nobody but Jesus . He knows . " Tom got down on his knees . He put his hand on Uncle John 's forehead , and it was hot and dry . John brushed his hand away clumsily . " Come on , " Tom pleaded . " Come on now , Uncle John . " " Ai n't goin ' go . Jus ' tar 'd . Gon ' res ' ri ' here . Ri ' here . " Tom was very close . He put his fist against the point of Uncle John 's chin . He made a small practice arc twice , for distance ; and then , with his shoulder in the swing , he hit the chin a delicate perfect blow . John 's chin snapped up and he fell backwards and tried to sit up again . But Tom was kneelingover him and as John got one elbow up Tom hit him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom stood up and , bending , he lifted the loose sagging body and boosted it over his shoulder . He staggered under the loose weight . John 's hanging hands tapped him on the back as he went , slowly , puffing up the bank to the highway . Once a car came by and lighted him with the limp man over his shoulder . The car slowed for a moment and then roared away . Tom was panting when he came back to the Hooverville ,   down from the road and to the Joad truck . John was coming to ; he struggled weakly . Tom set him gently down on the ground . Camp had been broken while he was gone . Al passed the bundles up on the truck . The tarpaulin lay ready to bind over the load . Al said , " He sure got a quick start . " Tom apologized . " I had to hit ' im a little to make ' im come . Poor fella . " " Didn ' hurt ' im ? " Ma asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . " Uncle John was weakly sick on the ground . His spasms of vomiting came in little gasps . Ma said , " I lef ' a plate a potatoes for you , Tom . " Tom chuckled . " I ai n't just in the mood right now . " Pa called , " Awright , Al . Sling up the tarp . " The truck was loaded and ready . Uncle John had gone to sleep . Tom and Al boosted and pulled him up on the load while Winfield made a vomiting noise behind the truck and Ruthie plugged her mouth with her hand to keep from squealing . " Awready , " Pa said . Tom asked , " Where 's Rosasharn ? " " Over there , " said Ma . " Come on , Rosasharn . We 're a-goin ' . " The girl sat still , her chin sunk on her breast . Tom walked over to her . " Come on , " he said . " I ai n't a-goin ' . " She did not raise her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want Connie . I ai n't a-goin ' till he comes back . " Three cars pulled out of the camp , up the road to the highway , old cars loaded with the camps and the people . TheyP379clanked up to the highway and rolled away , their dim lights glancing along the road . Tom said , " Connie 'll find us . I lef ' word up at the store where we 'd be . He 'll find us . " Ma came up and stood beside him . " Come on , Rosasharn . Come on , honey , " she said gently . " I wants wait . " " We ca n't wait . " Ma leaned down and took the girl by the arm and helped her to her feet . " He 'll find us , " Tom said . " Don ' you worry . He 'll find us . " They walked on either side of the girl . " Maybe he went to get them books to study up , " said Rose of Sharon . " Maybe he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's jus ' what he done . " They led her to the truck and helped her up on top of the load , and she crawled under the tarpaulin and disappeared into the dark cave . Now the bearded man from the weed shack came timidly to the truck . He waited about , his hands clutched behind his back . " You gon na leave any stuff a fella could use ? " he asked at last . Pa said , " Ca n't think of nothin ' . We ai n't got nothin ' to leave . " Tom asked , " Ai n't ya gettin ' out ? " For a long time the bearded man stared at him . " No , " he said at last . " But they 'll burn ya out . " The unsteady eyes dropped to the ground . " I know . They done it before . " " Well , why the hell do n't ya get out ? " The bewildered eyes looked up for a moment , and then down again , and the dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Takes so long to git stuff together . " " You wo n't have nothin ' if they burn ya out . " " I know . You ai n't leavin ' nothin ' a fella could use ? " " Cleaned out , slick , " said Pa . The bearded man vaguely wandered away . " What 's a matter with him ? " Pa demanded . " Cop-happy , " said Tom . " Fella was sayin '  --  he 's bullsimple . Been beat over the head too much . " A second little caravan drove past the camp and climbed to the road and moved away . " Come on , Pa . Let 's go . Look here , Pa . You an ' me an ' AI ride in the seat . Ma can get on the load . No . Ma , you ride in the middle . AI "  --  Tom reached under the seat and brought out a big monkey wrench  --  " Al , you get up behind . Take this here . Jus ' in case . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Al took the wrench and climbed up the back board , and he settled himself cross-legged , the wrench in his hand . Tom pulled the iron jack handle from under the seat and laid it on the floor , under the brake pedal . " Awright , " he said . " Get in the middle , Ma . " Pa said , " I ai n't got nothin ' in my han ' . " " You can reach over an ' get the jack handle , " said Tom . " I hope Al , you don ' need it . " He stepped on the starter and the clanking flywheel turned over , the engine caught and died , and caught again . Tom turned on the lights and moved out of the camp in low gear . The dim lights fingered the road nervously . They climbed up to the highway and turned south . Tom said , " They comes a time when a man gets mad . " Ma broke in , " Tom  --  you tol ' me  --  you promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "   " I know , Ma . I 'm a-tryin ' . But them deputies  --  Did you ever see a deputy that didn ' have a fat ass ? An ' they waggle their ass an ' flop their gun aroun ' . Ma , " he said , " if it was the law they was workin ' with , why , we could take it . But it ai n't the law . They 're a-workin ' away at our spirits . They 're a-try-in ' to make us cringe an ' crawl like a whipped bitch . They tryin ' to break us . Why , fit , Ma , they comes a time when the on'y way a fella can keep his decency is by takin ' a sock at a cop . They 're workin ' on our decency . " Ma said , " You promised , Tom . That 's how Pretty Boy Floyd done . I knowed his ma . They hurt him . " " I 'm a-tryin ' , Ma . Honest to God , I am . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with my belly on the groun ' , do you ?

But when one a them fat asses gets to work in ' me over , I got a big job tryin ' . If it was the law , it 'd be different . But burnin ' the camp ai n't the law . " The car jolted along . Ahead , a little row of red lanterns stretched across the highway . " Detour , I guess , " Toni said . He slowed the car and stopped it , and immediately a crowd of men swarmed about the truck . They were armed with pick handles and shotguns . They wore trench helmets and some American Legion caps . One man leaned in the window , and the warm smell of whisky preceded him . " Where you think you 're goin ' ? " He thrust a red face near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crept down to the floor and felt for the jack handle . Ma caught his arm and held it powerfully . Tom said , " Well  --  " and then his voice took on a servileP382whine . " We 're strangers here , " he said . " We heard about they 's work in a place called Tulare . " " Well , goddamn it , you 're goin ' the wrong way . We ai n't gon na have no goddamn Okies in this town . " Tom 's shoulders and arms were rigid , and a shiver went through him . Ma clung to his arm . The front of the truck was surrounded by the armed men . Some of them , to make a military appearance , wore tunics and Sam Browne belts . Tom whined , " Which way is it at , mister ? " " You turn right around an ' head north . An ' do n't come back till the cotton 's ready . " Tom shivered all over . " Yes , sir , " he said . He put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He headed back the way he had come . Ma released his arm and patted him softly . And Tom tried to restrain his hard smothered sobbing . " Don ' you mind , " Ma said . " Don ' you mind . " Tom blew his nose out the window and wiped his eyes on his sleeve . " The sons-of-bitches --  " " You done good , " Ma said tenderly . " You done jus ' good . " Tom swerved into a side dirt road , ran a hundred yards , and turned off his lights and motor . He got out of the car , carrying the jack handle . " Where you goin ' ? " Ma demanded . " Jus ' gon na look . We ai n't goin ' north . " The red lanterns moved up the highway . Tom watched them cross the entrance of the dirt road and continue on . In a few moments there came the sounds of shouts and screams , and then a flaringlight arose from the direction of the Hooverville . The light grew and spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got in the truck again . He turned around and ran up the dirt road without lights . At the highway he turned south again , and he turned on his lights . P383Ma asked timidly , " Where we goin ' , Tom ? " " Goin ' south , " he said . " We couldn ' let them bastards push us aroun ' . We couldn ' . Try to get aroun ' the town ' thout goin ' through it . " " Yeah , but where we goin ' ? " Pa spoke for the first time . " That 's what I want to know . " " Gon na look for that gov'ment camp , " Tom said . " A fella said they don ' let no deputies in there . Ma  --  I got to get away from ' em . I 'm scairt I 'll kill one . " " Easy , Tom . " Ma soothed him . " Easy , Tommy . You done good once . You can do it again . " " Yeah , an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . " " Easy , " she said . " You got to have patience . Why , Tom  --  us people will go on livin ' when all them people is gone . Why , Tom , we 're the people that live . They ai n't gon na wipe us out . Why , we 're the people  --  we go on . " " We take a beatin ' all the time . " " I know . " Ma chuckled . " Maybe that makes us tough . Rich fellas come up an ' they die , an ' their kids ai n't no good , an ' they die out . But , Tom , we keep a-comin ' . Don ' you fret none , Tom . A different time 's comin ' . " " How do you know ? " " I don ' know how . " They entered the town and Tom turned down a side street to avoid the center . By the street lights he looked at his mother . Her face was quiet and a curious look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a statue . Tom put out his right hand and touched her on the shoulder . He had to . And then he withdrew his hand . " Never heard you talk so much in my life , " he said . " Was n't never so much reason , " she said . He drove through the side streets and cleared the town ,   and then he crossed back . At an intersection the sign said " 99 . " He turned south on it . " Well , anyways they never shoved us north , " he said . " We still go where we want , even if we got to crawl for theright . " The dim lights felt along the broad black highway ahead .   THE moving , questing people were migrants now . Those families which had lived on a little piece of land , who had lived and died on forty acres , had eaten or starved on the produce of forty acres , had now the whole West to rove in . And they scampered about , looking for work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ditch banks were lines of people . Behind them more were coming . The great highways streamed with moving people . There in the Middle- and Southwest had lived a simple agrarian folk who had not changed with industry , who had not formed with machines or known the power and danger of machines in private hands . They had not grown up in the paradoxes of industry . Their senses were still sharp to the ridiculousness of the industrial life . And then suddenly the machines pushed them out and they swarmed on the highways . The movement changed them ; the highways , the camps along the road , the fear of hunger and the hunger itself , changed them . The children without dinner changed them , the endless moving changed them . They were migrants . And the hostility changed them , welded them , united them  --  hostility that made the little towns group and arm as though to repel an invader , squads with pick handles , clerks and storekeepers with shotguns , guarding the world against their own people . In the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Men of property were terrified for their ' property . Men who had never been hungry saw the eyes of the hungry . Men who had never wanted anything very much saw the flare of want in the eyes of the migrants . And the men of the towns and of the soft suburban country gathered to defend themselves ; and they reassured themselves that they were good and the invaders bad , as a man must do before he fights . They said , These goddamned Okies are dirty and ignorant . They 're degenerate , sexual maniacs . These goddamned Okies are thieves . They 'll steal anything . They 've got no sense of property rights . And the latter was true , for how can a man without propertyknow the ache of ownership ? And the defending people said , They bring disease , they 're filthy . We ca n't have them in the schools . They 're strangers . How 'd you like to have your sister go out with one of ' em ? The local people whipped themselves into a mold of cruelty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  armed them with clubs , with gas , with guns . We own the country . We ca n't let these Okies get out of hand . And the men who were armed did not own the land , but they thought they did . And the clerks who drilled at night owned nothing , and the little storekeepers possessed only a drawerful of debts . But even a debt is something , even a job is something . The clerk thought , I get fifteen dollars a week . S'pose a goddamn Okie would work for twelve ? And the little storekeeperthought , How could I compete with a debtless man ? And the migrants streamed in on the highways and their hunger was in their eyes , and their need was in their eyes . They had no argument , no system , nothing but their numbersand their needs . When there was work for a man , ten P387men fought for it  --  fought with a low wage . If that fella 'll work for thirty cents , I 'll work for twenty-five . If he 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , me , I 'm hungry . I 'll work for fifteen . I 'll work for food . The kids . You ought to see them . Little boils , like , comin ' out , an ' they ca n't run aroun ' . Give ' em some windfallfruit , an ' they bloated up . Me . I 'll work for a little piece of meat . And this was good , for wages went down and prices stayed up . The great owners were glad and they sent out more handbills to bring more people in . And wages went down and prices stayed up . And pretty soon now we 'll have serfs again . And now the great owners and the companies invented a new method . A great owner bought a cannery . And when the peaches and the pears were ripe he cut the price of fruit below the cost of raising it . And as cannery owner he paid himself a low price for the fruit and kept the price of canned goods up and took his profit . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they were taken by the great owners , the banks , and the companies who also owned the canneries . As time went on , there were fewer farms . The little farmers moved into town for a while and exhausted their credit , exhausted their friends , their relatives . And then they too went on the highways . And the roads were crowded with men ravenous for work , murderous for work . And the companies , the banks worked at their own doom and they did not know it . The fields were fruitful , and starvingmen moved on the roads . The granaries were full and the children of the poor grew up rachitic , and the pustules of pellagra swelled on their sides . The great companies did not know that the line between hunger and anger is a thin line . And money that might have gone to wages went for gas , for guns , for agents and spies , for blacklists , for drilling . On the highways the people moved like ants and searched for work , for food . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late when Tom Joad drove along a country road looking for the Weedpatch camp . There were few lights in the countryside . Only a sky glare behind showed the direction of Bakersfield . The truck jiggled slowly along and hunting cats left the road ahead of it . At a crossroad there was a little cluster of white wooden buildings . Ma was sleeping in the seat and Pa had been silent and withdrawn for a long time . Tom said , " I don ' know where she is . Maybe we 'll wait till daylight an ' ast somebody . " He stopped at a boulevard signal and another car stopped at the crossing . Tom leaned out . " Hey , mister . Know where the big camp is at ? " " Straight ahead . " Tom pulled across into the opposite road . A few hundred yards , and then he stopped . A high wire fence faced the road , and a wide-gated driveway turned in . A little way inside the gate there was a small house with a light in the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air and crashed down again . " Jesus ! " Tom said . " I didn ' even see that hump . " A watchman stood up from the porch and walked to the car . He leaned on the side . " You hit her too fast , " he said . " Next time you 'll take it easy . " " What is it , for God 's sake ? "  | The watchman laughed . " Well , a lot of kids play in here . You tell folks to go slow and they 're liable to forget . But let ' em hit that hump once and they do n't forget . " " Oh ! Yeah . Hope I didn ' break nothin ' . Say  --  you got any room here for us ? " " Got one camp . How many of you ? " . - Tom counted on his fingers . " Me an ' Pa an ' Ma , Al an ' Rosasharn an ' Uncle John an ' RutEiie an ' Winfiel ' . Them last is kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Got any camping stuff ? " " Got a big tarp an ' beds . " The watchman stepped up on the running board . " Drive down the end of that line an ' turn right . You 'll be in Number Four Sanitary Unit . " " What 's that ? " " Toilets and showers and wash tubs . " Ma demanded , " You got wash tubs  --  running water ? " " Sure . " " Oh ! Praise God , " said Ma . Tom drove down the long dark row of tents . In the sanitarybuilding a low light burned . " Pull in here , " the watchmansaid . " It 's a nice place . Folks that had it just moved out . " Tom stopped the car . " Right there ? " " Yeah . Now you let the others unload while I sign you up . Get to sleep . The camp committee 'll call on you in the morning and get you fixed up . " Tom 's eyes drew down . " Cops ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We got our own cops . Folks here elect their own cops . Come along . " Al dropped off the truck and walked around . " Gon na stay here ? "   " Yeah , " said Tom . " You an ' Pa unload while I go to the office . " " Be kinda quiet , " the watchman said . " They 's a lot of folks sleeping . " Tom followed through the dark and climbed the office steps and entered a tiny room containing an old desk and a chair . The guard sat down at the desk and took out a form . " Name ? " " Tom Joad . " " That your father ? " " Yeah . " " His name ? " " Tom Joad , too . " The questions went on . Where from , how long in the State , what work done . The watchman looked up . " I 'm not nosy . We got to have this stuff . " " Sure , " said Tom . " Now  --  got any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't destitute ? " " Got a little . Why ? " " Well , the camp site costs a dollar a week , but you can work it out , carrying garbage , keeping the camp clean  --  stuff like that . " " We 'll work it out , " said Tom . " You 'll see the committee tomorrow . They 'll show you how to use the camp and tell you the rules . " Tom said , " Say  --  what is this ? What committee is this , anyways ? " The watchman settled himself back . " Works pretty nice . There 's five sanitary units . Each one elects a Central Corn- mittee man . Now that committee makes the laws . What they say goes . " " S'pose they get tough , " Tom said . " Well , you can vote ' em out jus ' as quick as you vote ' em in . They 've done a fine job . Tell you what they did  --  you know the Holy Roller preachers all the time follow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Well , they wanted to preach in this camp . And a lot of the older folks wanted them . So it was up to the Central Committee . They went into meeting and here 's how they fixed it . They say , Any preacher can preach in this camp . Nobody can take up a collection in this camp . ' And it was kinda sad for the old folks , ' cause there has n't been a preacher in since . " Tom laughed and then he asked , " You mean to say the fellas that runs the camp is jus ' fellas  --  campin ' here ? " " Sure . And it works . " " You said about cops --  " " Central Committee keeps order an ' makes rules . Then there 's the ladies . They 'll call on your ma . They keep care of kids an ' look after the sanitary units . If your ma is n't working , she 'll look after kids for the ones that is working , an ' when she gets a job  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a nurse comes out an ' teaches ' em . All kinds of things like that . " " You mean to say they ai n't no cops ? " " No , sir . No cop can come in here without a warrant . " " Well , spore a fella is jus ' mean , or drunk an ' quarrelsome . What then ? " The watchman stabbed the blotter with a pencil . " Well , the first time the Central Committee warns him . And the second time they really warn him . The third time they kick him out of the camp . "  | " God Almighty , I ca n't hardly believe it ! Tonight the deputies an ' them fellas with the little caps , they burned the camp out by the river . " " They do n't get in here , " the watchman said . " Some nights the boys patrol the fences , ' specially dance nights . " " Dance nights ? - ! " " We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't they more places like this ? " The watchman looked sullen . " You 'll have to find that out yourself . Go get some sleep . " " Good night , " said Tom . " Ma 's gon na like this place . She ai n't been treated decent for a long time . " " Good night , " the watchman said . " Get some sleep . This camp wakes up early . " Tom walked down the street between the rows of tents . His eyes grew used to the starlight . He saw that the rows were straight and that there was no litter about the tents . The ground of the street had been swept and sprinkled . From the tents came the snores of sleeping people . The whole camp buzzed and snorted . Tom walked slowly . He neared NumberFour Sanitary Unit and he looked at it curiously , an unpaintedbuilding , low and rough . Under a roof , but open at the sides , the rows of wash trays . He saw the Joad truck standing near by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitched and the camp was quiet . As he drew near a figure moved from the shadow of the truck and came toward him . Ma said softly , " That you , Tom ? " " Yeah . " " Sh ! " she said . " They 're all asleep . They was tar 'd out . "   " You ought to be asleep too , " Tom said . " Well , I wanted to see ya . Is it awright ? " " It 's nice , " Tom said . " I ai n't gon na tell ya . They 'll tell ya in the mornin ' . Ya gon na like it . " She whispered , " I heard they got hot water . " " Yeah . Now you get to sleep . I don ' know when you slep ' Ias ' . " She begged , " What ai n't you a-gonna tell me ? " " I ai n't . You get to sleep . " Suddenly she seemed girlish . " How can I sleep if I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " " No , you do n't , " Tom said . " First thing in the mornin ' you get on your other dress an ' then  --  you 'll find out . " " I ca n't sleep with nothin ' like that hangin ' over me . " " You got to , " Tom chuckled happily . " You jus ' got to . " " Good night , " she said softly ; and she bent down andslipped under the dark tarpaulin . Tom climbed up over the tail-board of the truck . He lay down on his back on the wooden floor and he pillowed his head on his crossed hands , and his forearms pressed against his ears . The night grew cooler . Tom buttoned his coat over his chest and settled back again . The stars were clear and sharp over his head . It was still dark when he awakened . A small clashing noise brought him up from sleep . Tom listened and heard again the squeak of iron on iron . He moved stiffly and shivered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood up and looked over the side of the truck . The eastern mountains were blueblack , and as he watched , the light stood up faintly behind them , colored at the mountain rims with a washed red , then growing colder , grayer , darker , as it went up overhead , untilP395at a place near the western horizon it merged with pure night . Down in the valley the earth was the lavender-gray of dawn . The clash of iron sounded again . Tom looked down the line of tents , only a little lighter gray than the ground . Besidea tent he saw a flash of orange fire seeping from the cracks in an old iron stove . Gray smoke spurted up from a stubby smoke-pipe . Tom climbed over the truck side and dropped to the ground . He moved slowly toward the stove . He saw a girl working about the stove , saw that she carried a baby on her crooked arm , and that the baby was nursing , its head up under the girl 's shirtwaist . And the girl moved about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a better draft , opening the oven door ; and all the time the baby sucked , and the mother shifted it deftly from arm to arm . The baby did n't interfere with her work or with the quick gracefulnessof her movements . And the orange fire licked out of the stove cracks and threw flickering reflections on the tent . Tom moved closer . He smelled frying bacon and baking bread . From the east the light grew swiftly . Tom came near to the stove and stretched out his hands to it . The girl looked at him and nodded , so that her two braids jerked . " Good mornin ' , " she said , and she turned the bacon in the pan . The tent flap jerked up and a young man came out and an older man followed him . They were dressed in new blue dungarees and in dungaree coats , stiff with filler , the brass buttons shining . They were sharp-faced men , and they looked much alike . The younger man had a dark stubble beard and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces were wet , their hair dripped , water stood in drops on their stiff beards . Their cheeks shone with dampness . Togetherthey stood looking quietly into the lightening east . They yawned together and watched the light on the hill rims . And then they turned and saw Toni . " Mornin ' , " the older man said , and his face was neither friendly nor unfriendly . " Mornin ' , " said Tom . And , " Mornin ' , " said the younger man . The water slowly dried on their faces . They came to the stove and warmed their hands at it . The girl kept to her work . Once she set the baby down and tied her braids together in back with a string , and the two braids jerked and swung as she worked . She set tin cups on a big packing box , set tin plates and knives and forks out . Then she scooped bacon from the deep grease and laid it on a tin platter , and the bacon cricked and rustled as it grew crisp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a square pan full of big high biscuits . When the smell of the biscuits struck the air both of the men inhaled deeply . The younger said , " Kee-rist ! " softly . Now the older man said to Tom , " Had your breakfast ? ' - ' " Well , no , I ai n't . But my folks is over there . They ai n't up . Need the sleep . " " Well , set down with us , then . We got plenty  --  thank God ! " " Why , thank ya , " Tom said . " Smells so darn good I couldn ' say no . " " Do n't she ? " the younger man asked . " Ever smell anything so good in ya life ? " They marched to the packing box and squatted around it . " Workin ' around here ? " the young man asked .   " Aim to , " said Tom . " We jus ' got in las ' night . Ai n't had no chance to look aroun ' . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man said . The girl , working by the stove , said , " They even got new clothes . " Both men looked down at their stiff blue clothes , and they smiled a little shyly . The girl set out the platter of bacon and the brown , high biscuits and a bowl of bacon gravy and a pot of coffee , and then she squatted down by the box too . The baby still nursed , its head up under the girl 's shirtwaist . They filled their plates , poured bacon gravy over the biscuits , and sugared their coffee . The older man filled his mouth full , and he chewed and chewed and gulped and swallowed . " God Almighty , it 's good ! " he said , and he filled his mouth again . The younger man said , " We been eatin ' good for twelve days now . Never missed a meal in twelve days  --  none of us . Workin ' an ' gettin ' our pay an ' eatin ' . " He fell to again , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scalding coffee and threw the grounds to the earth and filled their cups again . There was color in the light now , a reddish gleam . The father and son stopped eating . They were facing to the east and their faces were lighted by the dawn . The image of the mountain and the light coming over it were reflected in their eyes . And then they threw the grounds from their cups to the earth , and they stood up together . " Got to git goin ' , " the older man said . The younger turned to Tom . " Lookie , " he said . " We 're layin ' some pipe . ' F you want to walk over with us , maybe we could get you on . "  | Tom said , " Well , that 's mighty nice of you . An ' I sure thank ya for the breakfast . " " Glad to have you , " the older man said . " We 'll try to git you workin ' if you want . " " Ya goddamn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' wait a minute . I 'll tell my folks . " He hurried to the Joad tent and bent over and looked inside . In the gloom under the tarpaulin he saw the lumps of sleeping figures . But a little movement started among the bedclothes . Ruthie came wriggling out like a snake , her hair down over her eyes and her dress wrinkled and twisted . She crawled carefully out and stood up . Her gray eyes were clear and calm from sleep , and mischief was not in them . Tom moved off from the tent and beckoned her to follow , and when he turned , she looked up at him . " Lord God , you 're growin ' up , " he said . She looked away in sudden embarrassment . " Listen here , " Tom said . " Do n't you wake nobody up , but when they get up , you tell ' em I got a chancet at a job , an ' I 'm a-goin ' for it . Tell Ma I et breakfas ' with some neighbors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head away , and her eyes were little girl 's eyes . " Do n't you wake ' em up , " Tom cautioned . He hurried back to his new friends . And Ruthie cautiously approached the sanitary unit and peeked in the open doorway . The two men were waiting when Tom came back . The young woman had dragged a mattress out and put the baby on it while she cleaned up the dishes . Tom said , " I wanted to tell my folks where-at I was . They was n't awake . " The three walked down the street between the tents . The camp had begun to come to life . At the new fires the women worked , slicing meat , kneading the dough for thep399morning 's bread . And the men were stirring about the tents and about the automobiles . The sky was rosy now . In front of the office a lean old man raked the ground carefully . He so dragged his rake that the tine marks were straight and deep . " You 're out early , Pa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yep , yep . Got to make up my rent . " " Rent , hell ! " the young man said . " He was drunk last Sat'dy night . Sung in his tent all night . Committee give him work for it . " They walked along the edge of the oiled road ; a row of walnut trees grew beside the way . The sun shoved its edge over the mountains . Tom said , " Seems funny . I 've et your food , an ' I ai n't tol ' you my name  --  nor you ai n't mentioned yours . I 'm Tom Joad . " The older man looked at him , and then he smiled a little . " You ai n't been out here long ? " " Hell , no ! Jus ' a couple days . " " I knowed it . Funny , you git outa the habit a mentionin ' your name . They 's so goddamn many . Jist fellas . Well , sir  --  I 'm Timothy Wallace , an ' this here 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tom said . " You been out here long ? " " Ten months , " Wilkie said . " Got here right on the tail a the floods las ' year , Jesus. - We had a time , a time ! goddamn near starve ' to death . " Their feet rattled on the oiled road . A truckload of men went by , and each man was sunk into himself . Each man braced himself in the truck bed and scowled down . " Goin ' out for the Gas Company , " Timothy said . " They got a nice job of it . "   " I could of took our truck , " Tom suggested . " No . " Timothy leaned down and picked up a green walnut . He tested it with his thumb and then shied it at a blackbirdsitting on a fence wire . The bird flew up , let the nut sail under it , and then settled back on the wire and smoothed its shining black feathers with its beak . Tom asked , " Ai n't you got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom , looking at their faces , saw that they were ashamed . Wilkie said , " Place we , work at is on'y a mile up the road . " Timothy said angrily , " No , we ai n't got no car . We sol ' our car . Had to . Run outa food , run outa ever'thing . Couldn ' git no job . Fellas come aroun ' ever ' week , buyin ' cars . Come aroun ' , an ' if you 're hungry , why , they 'll buy your car . An ' if you 're hungry enough , they do n't hafta pay nothin ' for it . An '  --  we was hungry enough . Give us ten dollars for her . " He spat into the road . Wilkie said quietly , " I was in Bakersfiel ' las ' week . I seen her  --  a-settin ' in a use ' - car lot  --  settin ' right there , an ' seventy-five dollars was the sign on her . " " We had to , " Timothy said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or us steal somepin from them . We ai n't had to steal yet , but , goddamn it , we been close ! " Tom said , " You know , ' fore we lef home , we heard they was plenty work out here . Seen han'bills askin ' folks to conic out . " " Yeah , " Timothy said . " We seen ' em too . An ' they ai n't much work . An ' wages is comin ' down all a time . I git so goddamn tired jus ' figgerin ' how to eat . " " You got work now , " Tom suggested . " Yeah , but it ai n't gon na las ' long . Workin ' for a nice fella . P401Got a little place . Works ' longside of us . But , hell  --  it ai n't gon na las ' no time . " Tom said , " Why in hell you gon na git me on ? I 'll make it shorter . What you cuttin ' your own throat for ? " Timothy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Got no sense , I guess . We figgered to get us each a hat . Ca n't do it , I guess . There 's the place , off to the right there . Nice job , too . Gettin ' thirty cents an hour . Nice frien'ly fella to work for . " They turned off the highway and walked down a graveled road , through a small kitchen orchard ; and behind the trees they came to a small white farm house , a few shade trees , and a barn ; behind the barn a vineyard and a field of cotton . As the three men walked past the house a screen door banged , and a stocky sunburned man came down the back steps . He wore a paper sun helmet , and he rolled up his sleeves as he came across the yard . His heavy sunburned eyebrowswere drawn down in a scowl . His cheeks were sunburneda beef red . " Mornin ' , Mr. Thomas , " Timothy said . " Morning . " The man spoke irritably . Timothy said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could see your way to put him on ? " Thomas scowled at Tom . And then he laughed shortly , and his brows still scowled . " Oh , sure ! I 'll put him on . I 'll put everybody on . Maybe I 'll get a hundred men on . " " We jus ' thought  --  " Timothy began apologetically . Thomas interrupted him . " Yes , I'been thinkin ' too . " He swung around and faced them . " I 've got some things to tell you . I been paying you thirty cents an hour  --  that right ? " " Why , sure , Mr. Thomas  --  but --  " " And I been getting thirty cents ' worth of work . " His heavy hard hands clasped each other .   " We try to give a good day of work . " " Well , goddamn it , this morning you 're getting twentyfivecents an hour , and you take it or leave it . " The redness of his face deepened with anger . Timothy said , " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I know it . But it seems like I ai n't hiring my own men any more . " He swallowed . " Look , " he said . " I got sixty-five acres here . Did you ever hear of the Farmers ' Association ? " " Why , sure . " " Well , I belong to it . We had a meeting last night . Now , do you know who runs the Farmers ' Association ? I 'll tell you . The Bank of the West . That bank owns most of this valley , and it 's got paper on everything it do n't own . So last night the member from the bank told me , he said , You 're paying thirty cents an hour . You 'd better cut it down to twenty-five . ' I said , I 've got good men . They 're worth thirty . ' And he says , It is n't that , ' he says . The wage is twenty-five now . If you pay thirty , it 'll only cause unrest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to need the usual amount for a crop loan next year ? ' " Thomas stopped . His breath was panting through his lips . " You see ? The rate is twenty-five cents  --  and like it . " " We done good work , " Timothy said helplessly . " Ai n't you got it yet ? Mr. Bank hires two thousand men an ' I hire three . I 've got paper to meet . Now if you can figure some way out , by Christ , I 'll take it ! They got me . " Timothy shook his head . " I don ' know what to say . " " You wait here . " Thomas walked quickly to the house . The door slammed after him . In a moment he was back , and he carried a newspaper in his hand . " Did you see this ? Here , I 'll read it : Citizens , angered at red agitators , burn squatters '  | camp . Last night a band of citizens , infuriated at the agitationgoing on in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground and warned agitators to get out of the county . ' " Tom began , " Why , I  --  " and then he closed his mouth and was silent . Thomas folded the paper carefully and put it in his pocket . He had himself in control again . He said quietly , " Those men were sent out by the Association . Now I 'm giving ' em away . And if they ever find out I told , I wo n't have a farm next year . " " I jus ' do n't know what to say , " Timothy said . " If they was agitators , I can see why they was mad . " Thomas said , " I watched it a long time . There 's always red agitators just before a pay cut . Always . Goddamn it , they got me trapped . Now , what are you going to do ? Twentyfivecents ? " Timothy looked at the ground . " I 'll work , " he said . " Me too , " said Wilkie . Tom said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll work . I got to work . " Thomas pulled a bandanna out of his hip pocket and wiped his mouth and chin . " I do n't know how long it can go on . I do n't know how you men can feed a family on what you get now . " " We can while we work , " Wilkie said . " It 's when we do n't git work . " Thomas looked at his watch . " Well , let 's go out and dig some ditch . By God , " he said , " I 'm a-gonna tell you . You fellas live in that government camp , do n't you ? " Timothy stiffened . " Yes , sir . " " And you have dances every Saturday night ? " Wilkie smiled . " We sure do . "   " Well , look out next Saturday night . " Suddenly Timothy straightened . He stepped close . " What you mean ? I belong to the Central Committee . I got to know . " Thomas looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What is it ? " Timothy demanded . " Well , the Association do n't like the government " camps . Ca n't get a deputy in there . The people make their own laws , I hear , and you ca n't arrest a man without a warrant . Now if there was a big fight and ' rnaybe shooting  --  a bunch of deputiescould go in and clean out the camp . " Timothy had changed . His shoulders were straight and his eyes cold . " What you mean ? " " Do n't you ever tell where you heard , " Thomas said uneasily . " There 's going to be a fight in the camp Saturday night . And there 's going to be deputies ready to go in . " Torn demanded , " Why , for God 's sake ? Those folks ai n't bothering nobody . " " I 'll tell you why , " Thomas said . " Those folks in the camp are getting used to being treated like humans . When they go back to the squatters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wiped his face again . " Go on out to work now Jesus I hope I have n't talked myself out of my farm . But I like you peo-ple . " Timothy stepped in front of him and put out a hard lean hand , and Thomas took it . " Nobody wo n't know who tol ' . We thank you . They wo n't be no fight . " " Go on to work , " Thomas said . " And it 's twenty-five cents an hour . " " We 'll take it , " Wilkie said , " from you . " Thomas walked away toward the house . " I 'll be out in ap405piece , " he said . " You men get to work . " The screen door slammed behind him . The three men walked out past the little white-washed barn , and along a field edge . They came to'a long narrow ditch with sections of concrete pipe lying beside it . " Here 's where we 're a-workin ' , " Wilkie said . His father opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he said to Tom , " Here 's your beauty . " Tom hefted the pick . " Jumping If she do n't feelgood ! " " Wait 'll about ' leven o'clock , " Wilkie suggested . " See how good she feels then . " They walked to the end of the ditch . Tom took off his coat and dropped it on the dirt pile . He pushed up his cap and stepped into the ditch . Then he spat on his hands . The pick arose into the air and flashed down . Tom grunted softly . The pick rose and fell , and the grunt came at the momentit sank into the ground and loosened the soil . Wilkie said , " Yes , sir , Pa , we got here a first-grade muckstickman . This here boy been married to that there little digger . " Tom said , " I put in time ( umph ) . Yes , sir , I sure did ( umph ) . Put in my years ( umph ! ) . Kinda like the feel ( umph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sun cleared the fruit trees now and the grape leaves were golden green on the vines . Six feet along and Tom stepped aside and wiped his forehead . Wilkie came behind him . The shovel rose and fell and the dirt flew out to the pile beside the lengthening ditch . " I heard about this here Central Committee , " said Torn . " So you 're one of ' em . " " Yes , sir , " Timothy replied . " And it 's a responsibility . AllAP4o6 them people . We 're doin ' our best . An ' the people in the camp a-doin ' their best . I wisht them big farmers wouldn ' plague us so . I wisht they wouldn ' . " Tom climbed back into the ditch and Wilkie stood aside . Tom said , " How ' bout this fight ( umph ! ) at the dance , he tol ' about ( umph ) ? What they wanta do that for ? " Timothy followed behind Wilkie , and Timothy 's shovel beveled the bottom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Seems like they got to drive us , " Timothy said . " They 're scairt we 'll organize , I guess . An ' maybe they 're right . This here camp is a organization . People there look out for theirselves . Got the nicest Strang band in these parts . Got a little charge account in the store for folks that 's hungry . Fi ' dollars  --  you can git that much food an ' the camp 'll stan ' good . We ai n't never had no trouble with the law . I guess the big farmers is scairt of that . Ca n't throw us in jail  --  why , it scares ' em . Figger maybe if we can gove'n ourselves , maybe we 'll do other things . " Tom stepped clear of the ditch and wiped the sweat out of his eyes . " You hear what that paper said ' bout agitators up north a Bakersfiel ' ? " " Sure , " said Wilkie . " They do that all a time . " " Well , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call reds . What the hell is these reds anyways ? " Timothy scraped a little hill level in the bottom of the ditch . The sun made his white bristle beard shine . " They 's a lot a fellas wanta know what reds is . " He laughed . " One of our boys foun ' out . " He patted the piled earth gently with his shovel . " Fella named Hines  --  got ' bout thirty thousan ' acres , peaches and grapes  --  got a cannery an ' a winery . Well , he 's all a time talkin ' about them goddamn reds . ' Goddamnreds is drivin ' the country to ruin , ' he says , an ' WeP407got to drive these here red bastards out . ' Well , they were a young fella jus ' come out west here , an ' he 's listenin ' one day . He kinda scratched his head an ' he says , Mr. Hines , I ai n't been here long . What is these goddamn reds ? ' Well , sir , Hines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents an hour when we 're payin ' twenty-five ! ' Well , this young fella he thinks about her , an ' he scratches his head , an ' he says , Well , Jesus , Mr. Hines . I ai n't a son-of-a-bitch , but if that 's what a red is  --  why , I want thirty cents an hour . Ever'body does . Hell , Mr. Hines , we 're all reds . ' " Timothy drove his shovel along the ditch bottom , and the solid earth shone where the shovel cut it . Tom laughed . " Me too , I guess . " His pick arced up and drove down , and the earth cracked under it . The sweat rolled down his forehead and down the sides of his nose , and it glistened on his neck . " Damn it , " he said , " a pick is a nice tool ( umph ) , if you don ' fight it ( umph ) . You an ' the pick ( umph ) workin ' together ( umph ) . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ditch inched along , and the sun shone hotly down on them in the growing morning . When Tom left her , Ruthie gazed in at the door of the sanitary unit for a while . Her courage was not strong withoutWinfield to boast for . She put a hare foot in on the concrete floor , and then withdrew it . Down the line a woman came out of a tent and started a fire in a tin camp stove . Ruthic took a few steps in that direction , but she could rot leave . She crept to the entrance of the Joad tent and looked in . On one side , lying on the ground , lay Uncle John , his mouth open and his snores bubbling spittily in his throat . Ma and Pa were covered with a comfort , their heads in , awayP408from the light . Al was on the far side from Uncle John , and his arm was flung over his eyes . Near the front of the tent Rose of Sharon and Winfield lay , and there was the space where Ruthie had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . Her eyes remained on Winfield 's tow head ; and as she looked , the little boy opened his eyes and stared out at her , and his eyes were solemn . Ruthie put her finger to her lips and beckoned with her other hand . Winfield rolled his eyes over to Rose of Sharon . Her pink flushed face was near to him , and her mouth was open a little . Winfield carefullyloosened the blanket and slipped out . He crept out of the tent cautiously and joined Ruthie . " How long you been up ? " he whispered . She led him away with elaborate caution , and when they were safe , she said , " I never been to bed . I was up all night . " " You was not , " Winfield said . " You 're a dirty liar . " " Awright , " she said . " If I 'm a liar I ai n't gon na tell you nothin ' that happened . I ai n't gon na tell how the fella got killed with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an ' took off a little chile . " " They was n't no bear , " Winfield said uneasily . He brushed up his hair with his fingers and he pulled down his overalls at the crotch . " All right  --  they was n't no bear , " she said sarcastically . " An ' they ai n't no white things made outa dish-stuff , like in the catalogues . " Winfield regarded her gravely . He pointed to the sanitary unit . " In there ? " he asked . " I 'm a dirty liar , " Ruthie said . " It ai n't gon na do me no good to tell stuff to you . " " Le 's go look , " Winfield said.  | " I already been , " Ruthie said . " I already set on ' em . I even pee 'd in one . " " You never neither , " said Winfield . They went to the unit building , and that time Ruthie was not afraid . Boldly she led the way into the building . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each toilet had its compartment with a door in front of it . The porcelain was gleaming white . Hand basins lined another wall , while on the third wall were four shower compartments . " There , " said Ruthie . " Them 's the toilets . I seen ' em in the catalogue . " The children drew near to one of the toilets . Ruthie , in a burst of bravado , boosted her skirt and sat down . " I tol ' you I been here , " she said . And to prove it , there was a tinkle of water in the bowl . Winfield was embarrassed . His hand twisted the flushing lever . There was a roar of water . Ruthie leaped into the air and jumped away . She and Winfield stood in the middle of the room and looked at the toilet . The hiss of water continued in it . " You done it , " Ruthie said . " You went an ' broke it . I seen you. , , " I never . Honest I never . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You jus ' ai n't to be trusted with no nice stuff . " Winfield sunk his chin . He looked up at Ruthie and his eyes filled with tears . His chin quivered . And Ruthie was instantly contrite . " Never you mind , " she said . " I wo n't tell on you . We 'll pretend like she was already broke . We 'll pretend we ai n't even been in here . " She led him out of the building.  | The sun lipped over the mountain by now , shone on the corrugated-iron roofs of the five sanitary units , shone on the gray tents and on the swept ground of the streets between the tents . And the camp was waking up . The fires were burning in camp stoves , in the stoves made of kerosene cans and of sheets of metal . The smell of smoke was in the air . Tent flaps were thrown back and people moved about in the streets . In front of the Joad tent Ma stood looking up and down the street . She saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worryin ' , " Ma said . " I didn ' know where you was . " " We was jus ' lookin ' , " Ruthie said . " Well , where 's Tom ? You seen him ? " Ruthie became important . " Yes , ma'am . Tom , he got me up an ' he tol ' me what to tell you . " She paused to let her importancebe apparent . " Well  --  what ? " Ma demanded . " He said tell you  --  " She paused again and looked to see that Winfield appreciated her position . Ma raised her hand , the back of it toward Ruthie . " What ? " " He got work , " said Ruthie quickly . " Went out to work . " She looked apprehensively at Ma 's raised hand . The hand sank down again , and then it reached out for Ruthie . Ma embracedRuthie 's shoulders in a quick convulsive hug , and then released her . Ruthie stared at the ground in embarrassment , and changed the subject . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White ones . " " You been in there ? " Ma demanded . " Me an ' Vinfiel ' , " she said ; and then , treacherously , " Winfiel ' , he bust a toilet . " Winfield turned red . He glared at Ruthie . " She pee 'd in one , " he said viciously . P411Ma was apprehensive . " Now what did you do ? You show me . " She forced them to the door and inside . " Now what 'd you do ? " Ruthie pointed . " It was a-hissin ' and a-swishin ' . Stopped now . " " Show me what you done , " Ma demanded . Winfield went reluctantly to the toilet . " I didn ' push it hard , " he said . " I jus ' had aholt of this here , an '  --  " The swish of water came again . He leaped away . Ma threw back her head and laughed , while Ruthie and Winfield regarded her resentfully . " Tha 's the way she works , " Ma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish , you push that . " The shame of their ignorance was too great for the children . They went out the door , and they walked down the street to stare at a large family eating breakfast . Ma watched them out of the door . And then she looked about the room . She went to the shower closets and looked in . She walked to the wash basins and ran her finger over the white porcelain . She turned the water on a little and held her finger in the stream , and jerked her hand away when the water came hot . For a moment she regarded the basin , and then , setting the plug , she filled the bowl a little from the hot faucet , a little from the cold . And then she washed her hands in the warm water , and she washed her face . She was brushingwater through her hair with her fingers when a step sounded on the concrete floor behind her . Ma swung around . An elderly man stood looking at her with an expression of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in here ? " Ma gulped , and she felt the water dripping from her chin and soaking through her dress . " I didn ' know , " she said apologetically . " I thought this here was for folks to use . " The elderly man frowned on her . " For men folks , " he said sternly . He walked to the door and pointed to a sign on it : MEN . " There , " he said . " That proves it . Didn ' you seethat ? " " No , " Ma said in shame , " I never seen it . Ai n't they a placewhere I can go ? " The man 's anger departed . " You jus ' come ? " he askedmore kindly . " Middle of the night , " said Ma . " Then you ai n't talked to the Committee ? " " What committee ? " " Why , the Ladies ' Committee . " " No , I ai n't . " He said proudly , " The Committee 'll call on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take care of folks that jus ' come in . Now , if you want a ladies ' toilet , you jus ' go on the other side of the building . That side 's yourn . " Ma said uneasily , " Ya say a ladies ' committee  --  comin ' tomy tent ? " He nodded his head . " Purty soon , I guess . " " Thank ya , " said Ma . She hurried out , and half ran to thetent . " Pa , " she called . " John , git up ! You , Al . Git up an ' git washed . " Startled sleepy eyes looked out at her . " All of you , " Ma cried . " You git up an ' git your face washed . An ' combyour hair . " Uncle John looked pale and sick . There was a red bruisedplace on his chin . Pa demanded , " What 's the matter ? " " The Committee , " Ma cried . " They 's a committee  --  a ladies ' committee a-comin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ git washed . An ' while we was a-sleepin ' an ' a-snorin ' , Tom 's went out an ' got work . Git up , now . " They came sleepily out of the tent . Uncle John staggered a little , and his face was pained . " Git over to that house and wash up , " Ma ordered . " We got to get breakfus ' an ' be ready for the Committee . " She went to a little pile of split wood in the camp lot . She started a fire and put up her cooking irons . " Pone , " she said to herself . " Pone an ' gravy . That 's quick . Got to be quick . " She talked on to herself , and Ruthie and Winfield stood by , wondering . The smoke of the morning fires arose all over the camp , and the mutter of talk came from all sides . Rose of Sharon , unkempt and sleepy-eyed , crawled out of the tent . Ma turned from the cornmeal she was measuring in fistfuls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at her frizzled uncombed hair . " You got to clean up , " she said briskly . " Go right over and clean up . You got a clean dress . I washed it . Git your hair combed . Git the seeds out a your eyes . " Ma was excited . Rose of Sharon said sullenly , " I don ' feel good . I wisht Connie would come . I do n't feel like doin ' nothin ' ' thout Connie . " Ma turned full around on her . The yellow cornmeal clung to her hands and wrists . " Rosasharn , " she said sternly , " you git upright . You jus ' been mopin ' enough . They 's a ladies ' committee a-comin ' , an ' the fambly ai n't gon na be frawny when they get here . " " But I don ' feel good . " Ma advanced on her , mealy hands held out . " Git , " Ma said . " They 's times when how you feel got to be kep ' to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vomit , " Rose of Sharon whined . " Well , go an ' vomit . ' Course you 're gon na vomit . Ever ' - body does . Git it over an ' then you clean up , an ' you wash your legs an ' put on them shoes of yourn . " She turned back to her work . " An ' braid your hair , " she said . A frying pan of grease sputtered over the fire , and it splashed and hissed when Ma dropped the pone in with a spoon . She mixed flour with grease in a kettle and added water and salt and stirred the gravy . The coffee began to turn over in the gallon can , and the smell of coffee rose from it . Pa wandered back from the sanitary unit , and Ma looked critically up . Pa said , " Ya say Tom 's got work ? " " Yes , sir . Went out ' fore we was awake . Now look in that box an ' get you some clean overhalls an ' a shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You git in Ruthie an ' Winfiel 's ears . They 's hot water . Will you do that ? Scrounge aroun ' in their ears good , an ' their necks . Get ' em red an ' shinin ' . " " Never seen you so bubbly , " Pa said . Ma cried , " This here 's the time the fambly got to get decent . Comin ' acrost they was n't no chancet . But now we can . Th'ow your dirty overhalls in the tent an ' I 'll wash ' em out . " Pa went inside the tent , and in a moment he came out with pale blue , washed overalls and shirt on . And he led the sad and startled children toward the sanitary unit . Ma called after him , " Scrounge aroun ' good in their ears . " Uncle John came to the door of the men 's side and looked out , and then he went back and sat on the toilet a long time and held his aching head in his hands . Ma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ droppingspoons of dough in the grease for a second pan when ap415shadow fell on the ground beside her . She looked over her shoulder . A little man dressed all in white stood behind her  --  a man with a thin , brown , lined face and merry eyes . He was lean as a picket . His white clean clothes were frayed at the seams . He smiled at Ma . " Good morning , " he said . Ma looked at his white clothes and her face hardened with suspicion . " Mornin ' , " she said . " Are you Mrs. Joad ? " " Yes . " " Well , I 'm Jim Rawley . I 'm camp manager . Just dropped by to see if everything 's all right . Got everything you need ? " Ma studied him suspiciously . " Yes , " she said . Rawley said , " I was asleep when you came last night . Lucky we had a place for you . " His voice was warm . Ma said simply , " It 's nice . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women get to washing . Pretty soon now . You never heard such a fuss . Like a meeting . Know what they did yesterday , Mrs. Joad ? They had a chorus . Singing a hymn tune and rubbing the clothes all in time . That was something to hear , I tell you . " The suspicion was going out of Ma 's face . " Must a been nice . You 're the boss ? " " No , " he said . " The people here worked me out of a job . They keep the camp clean , they keep order , they do everything . I never saw such people . They 're making clothes in the meeting hall . And they 're making toys . Never saw such people . " Ma looked down at her dirty dress . " We ai n't clean yet , " she said . " You jus ' ca n't keep clean a-travelin ' . " " Do n't I know it , " he said . He sniffed the air . " Say  --  is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Does smell nice , do n't it ? Outside it always smells nice . " And she said proudly , " We 'd take it in honor ' f you 'd have some breakfus ' with us . " He came to the fire and squatted on his hams , and the last of Ma 's resistance went down . " We 'd be . proud to have ya , " she said . " We ai n't got much that 's nice , but you 're wel-come . " The little man grinned at her . " I had my breakfast . But I 'd sure like a cup of that coffee . Smells so good . " " Why  --  why , sure . " " Do n't hurry yourself . " Ma poured a tin cup of coffee from the gallon can . She said , " We ai n't got sugar yet . Maybe we 'll get some today . If you need sugar , it wo n't taste good . " " Never use sugar , " he said . " Spoils the taste of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little sugar , " said Ma . She looked at him suddenly and closely , to see how he had come so close so quickly . She looked for motive on his face , and found nothing but friendliness . Then she looked at the frayed seams on his white coat , and she was reassured . He sipped the coffee . " I guess the ladies 'll be here to see you this morning . " " We ai n't clean , " Ma said . " They should n't be comin ' till we get cleaned up a little . " " But they know how it is , " the manager said . " They came in the same way . No , sir . The committees are good in this camp because they do know . " He finished his coffee and stood up . " Well , I got to go on . Anything you want , why , come over to the office . I 'm there all the time . Grand coffee . Thank you . " He put the cup on the box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the line of tents . And Ma heard him speaking to the people as he went . P417Ma put down her head and she fought with a desire to cry . Pa came back leading the children , their eyes still wet with pain at the ear-scrounging . They were subdued and shining . The sunburned skin on Winfield 's nose was scrubbed off . " There , " Pa said . " Got dirt an ' two layers a skin . Had to almost lick ' em to make ' em stan ' still . " Ma appraised them . " They look nice , " she said . " He'p yaself to pone an ' gravy . We got to get stuff outa the way an ' the tent in order . " Pa served plates for the children and for himself . " Wonder where Tom got work ? " " I du n no . " " Well , if he can , we can . " Al came excitedly to the tent . " What a place ! " he said . He helped himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doin ' ? He 's buildin ' a house trailer . Right over there , back a them tents . Got beds an ' a stove  --  ever'thing . Jus ' live in her . By God , that 's the way to live ! Right where you stoptha'swhere you live . " Ma said , " I ruther have a little house . Soon 's we can , I want a little house . " Pa said , " Al  --  after we 've et , you an ' me an ' Uncle John 'll take the truck an ' go out lookin ' for work . " " Sure , " said Al . " I like to get a job in a garage if they 's any jobs . Tha 's what I really like . An ' get me a little of cut-down Ford . Paint her yella an ' go a-kyoodlin ' aroun ' . Seen a purty girl down the road . Give her a big wink , too . Purty as hell , too . " Pa said sternly , " You better get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Uncle John came out of the toilet and moved slowly near . Ma frowned at him .   " You ai n't washed  --  " she began , and then she saw how sick and weak and sad he looked . " You go on in the tent an ' lay down , " she said . " You ai n't well . " He shook his head . " No , " he said . " I sinned , an ' I got to take my punishment . " He squatted down disconsolately and poured himself a cup of coffee . Ma took the last pones from the pan . She said casually , " The manager of the camp come an ' set an ' had a cup a coffee . " Pa looked over slowly . " Yeah ? What 's he want awready ? " " Jus ' come to pass the time , " Ma said daintily . " Jus ' set down an ' had coffee . Said he didn ' get good coffee so often , an ' smelt our'n . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Didn ' want nothin ' . Come to see how we was gettin ' on . " " I don ' believe it , " Pa said . " He 's probably a-snootin ' an ' a-smellin ' aroun ' . " " He was not ! " Ma cried angrily . " I can tell a fella that 's snootin ' aroun ' quick as the nex ' person . " Pa tossed his coffee grounds out of his cup . " You got to quit that , " Ma said . " This here 's a clean place . " " You see she do n't get so goddamn clean a fella ca n't live in her , " Pa said jealously . " Hurry up , Al . We 're goin ' out lookin ' for a job . " Al wiped his mouth with his hand . " I 'm ready , " he said . Pa turned to Uncle John . " You a-comin ' ? " " Yes , I 'm a-comin ' . " " You do n't look so good . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comin ' . " Al got in the truck . " Have to get gas , " he said . He startedp419the engine . Pa and Uncle John climbed in beside him and the truck moved away down the street . Ma watched them go . And then she took a bucket and went to the wash trays under the open part of the sanitary unit . She filled her bucket with hot water and carried it back to her camp . And she was washing the dishes in the bucket when Rose of Sharon came back . " I put your stuff on a plate , " Ma said . And then she looked closely at the girl . Her hair was dripping and combed , and her skin was bright and pink . She had put on the blue dress printed with little white flowers . On her feet she wore the heeled slippers of her wedding . She blushed under Ma 's gaze . " You had a bath , " Ma said . Rose of Sharon spoke huskily . " I was in there when a lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? You get in a little stall-like , an ' you turn handles , an ' water comes a-floodin ' down on you  --  hot water or col ' water , jus ' like you want it  --  an ' I done it ! " " I 'm a-goin ' to myself , " Ma cried . " Jus ' soon as I get finish ' here . You show me how . " " I 'm a-gonna do it ever ' day , " the girl said . " An ' that lady  --  she seen me , an ' she seen about the baby , an '  --  know what she said ? Said they 's a nurse comes ever ' week . An ' I 'm to go see that nurse an ' she 'll tell me jus ' what to do so 's the baby 'll be strong . Says all the ladies here do that . An ' I 'm a-gonna do it . " The words bubbled out . " An '  --  know what  --  ? Las ' week they was a baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' they give clothes , an ' they give stuff for the baby  --  even give a baby buggy  --  wicker one . Was n't new , but they give it a coat a pink paint , an ' it was jus ' like new . An ' they give the baby a name , an ' had a cake . Oh , Lord ! " She subsided , breathing heavily.  | Ma said , " Praise God , we come home to our own people . I 'm a-gonna have a bath . " " Oh , it 's nice , " the girl said . Ma wiped the tin dishes and stacked them . She said , " We 're Joads . We do n't look up to nobody . Grampa 's grampa , he fit in the Revolution . We was farm people till the debt . And then  --  them people . They done somepin to us . Ever ' time they come seemed like they was a-whippin ' me  --  all of us . An ' in Needles , that police . He done somepin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel ashamed . An ' now I ai n't ashamed . These folks is our folks  --  is our folks . An ' that manager , he come an ' set an ' drank coffee , an ' he says , Mrs. Joad ' this , an " Mrs. Joad ' that  --  an " How you gettin ' on , Mrs. Joad ? ' " She stopped and sighed . " Why , I feel like people again . " She stacked the last dish . She went into the tent and dug through the clothes box for her shoes and a clean dress . And she found a little paper package with her earrings in it . As she went past Rose of Sharon , she said , " If them ladies comes , you tell ' em I 'll he right back . " She disappeared around the side of the sanitary unit . Rose of Sharon sat down heavily on a box and regarded her wedding shoes , black patent leather and tailored black bows . She wiped the toes with her finger and wiped her finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pressure on her growing abdomen . She sat up straight and touched herself with exploring fingers , and she smiled a little as she did it . Along the road a stocky woman walked , carrying an apple box of dirty clothes toward the wash tubs . Her face was brown with sun , and her eyes were black and intense . She wore a great apron , made from a cotton bag , over her ginghamdress , and men 's brown oxfords were on her feet . SheP421saw that Rose of Sharon caressed herself , and she saw the little smile on the girl 's face . " So ! " she cried , and she laughed with pleasure . " What you think it 's gon na be ? " Rose of Sharon blushed and looked down at the ground , and then peeked up , and the little shiny black eves of the woman took her in . " I don ' know , " she mumbled . The woman plopped the apple box on the ground . " Got a live tumor , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which 'd you ruther ? " she demanded . " I du n no  --  boy , I guess . Sure  --  boy . " " You jus ' come in , didn ' ya ? " " Las ' night  --  late . " " Gon na stay ? " " I don ' know . ' F we can get work , guess we will . " A shadow crossed the woman 's face , and the little black eyes grew fierce . " ' F you can git work . That 's what we all say . " " My brother got a job already this mornin ' . " " Did , huh ? Maybe you 're lucky . Look out for luck . You ca n't trus ' luck . " She stepped close . " You can only git one kind a luck . Cai n't have more . You be a good girl , " she said fiercely . " You be good . If you got sin on you  --  you better watch out for that there baby . " She squatted down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scandalous things goes on in this here camp , " she said darkly . " Ever ' Sat'dy night they 's dancin ' , an ' not only squar ' dancin ' , neither . They 's some does clutch-an ' - hug dancin ' ! I seen ' em . " Rose of Sharon said guardedly , " I like dancin ' , squar ' dancin ' . " And she added virtuously , " I never done that other kind . " The brown woman nodded her head dismally . " Well ,  |p422some  does . An ' the Lord ai n't lettin ' it get by , neither ; an ' don ' you think He is . " " No , ma'am , " the girl said softly . The woman put one brown wrinkled hand on Rose of Sharon 's knee , and the girl flinched under the touch . " You let me warn you now . They ai n't but a few deep down Jesusloverslef ' . Ever ' Sat'dy night when that there strang ban ' starts up an ' should be a-playin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a-reelin ' . I seen ' em . Won ' go near , myself , nor I don ' let my kin go near . They 's clutch-an ' - hug , I tell ya . " She paused for emphasis and then said , in a hoarse whisper , " They do more . They give a stage play . " She backed away and cocked her head to see how Rose of Sharon would take such a revelation . " Actors ? " the girl said in awe . " No , sir ! " the woman exploded . " Not actors , not them already damn ' people . Our own kinda folks . Our own people . An ' they was little children didn ' know no better , in it , an ' they was pertendin ' to be stuff they was n't . I didn ' go near . But I hearn ' em talkin ' what they was a-doin ' . The devil was jus ' a-struttin ' through this here camp . " Rose of Sharon listened , her eyes and mouth open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chile play  --  Christmus . " " Well  --  I ain ' sayin ' tha 's bad or good . They 's good folks thinks a Chris ' chile is awright . But  --  well , I wouldn ' care to come right out flat an ' say so . But this here wasn ' no Chris ' chile . This here was sin an ' delusion an ' devil stuff . Struttin ' an ' paradin ' an ' speakin ' like they 're somebody they ai n't . An ' dancin ' an ' clutchin ' an ' a-huggin ' . " Rose of Sharon sighed . " An ' not jus ' a few , neither , " the brown woman went on .   3 " Gettin ' so 's you can almos ' count the deep-down lambbloodfolks on your toes . An ' don ' you think them sinners is puttin ' nothin ' over on God , neither . No , sir , He 's a-chalkin ' ' em up sin by sin , an ' He 's drawin ' His line an ' addin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , an ' I 'm a-watchin ' . He 's awreadysmoked two of ' em out . " Rose of Sharon panted , " Has ? " The brown woman 's voice was rising in intensity . " I seen it . Girl a-carryin ' a little one , jes ' like you . An ' she playacted , an ' she hug-danced . And "  --  the voice grew bleak and ominous  --  " she thinned out and she skinnied out , an '  --  she dropped that baby , dead . " " Oh , my ! " The girl was pale . " Dead and bloody . ' Course nobody wouldn ' speak to her no more . She had a go away . Ca n't tech sin ' thout catchin ' it . No , sir . An ' they was another , done the same thing . An ' she skinnied out , an '  --  know what ? One night she was gone . An ' two days , she 's back . Says she was visitin ' . But  --  she ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the manager , he took her away to drop her baby . He don ' believe in sin . Tol ' me hisself . Says the sin is bein ' hungry . Says the sin is bein ' cold . Says  --  I tell ya , he tol ' me hisself  --  ca n't see God in them things . Says them girls skinnied out ' cause they didn ' git ' nough food . Well , I fixed him up . " She rose to her feet and stepped back . Her eyes were sharp . She pointed a rigid forefingerin Rose of Sharon 's face . " I says , Git back ! ' I says . I says , I knowed the devil was rampagin ' in this here camp . Now I know who the devil is . Git back , Satan , ' I says . An ' , by Chris ' , he got back ! Tremblin ' he was , an ' sneaky . Says , Please ! ' Says , Please don ' make the folks unhappy . ' I says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bout them dead babies an ' them poor sinners taint ' count of play-actin ' ? ' He jes ' looked , an ' he give a sick grin an ' went away . He knowed when he met a real testifier to the Lord . I says , I 'm a-helpin ' Jesus watch the goin's-on . An ' you an ' them other sinners ai n't gittin ' away with it . " She picked up her box of dirty clothes . " You take heed . I warned you . You take heed a that pore chile in your belly an ' keep outa sin . " And she strode away titanically , and her eyes shone with virtue . Rose of Sharon watched her go , and then she put her head down on her hands and whimpered into her palms . A soft voice sounded beside her . She looked up , ashamed . It was the little white-clad manager . " Do n't worry , " he said . " Do n't you worry . " Her eyes blinded with tears . " But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I didn ' tell her . I done it in Sallisaw . Me an ' Connie . " " Do n't worry , " he said . " She says I 'll drop the baby . " " I know she does . I kind of keep my eye on her . She 's a good woman , but she makes people unhappy . " Rose of Sharon sniffled wetly . " She knowed two girls los ' their baby right in this here camp . " The manager squatted down in front of her . " Look ! " he said . " Listen to me . I know them too . They were too hungry and too tired . And they worked too hard . And they rode on a truck over bumps . They were sick . It was n't their fault . " " But she said --  " " Do n't worry . That woman likes to make trouble . " " But she says you was the devil . " " I know she does . That 's because I wo n't let her make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't you worry . She does n't know . " And he walked quickly away . P425Rose of Sharon looked after him ; his lean shoulders jerked as he walked . She was still watching his slight figure when Ma came back , clean and pink , her hair combed and wet , and gathered in a knot . She wore her figured dress and the old cracked shoes ; and the little earrings hung in her ears . " I done it , " she said . " I stood in there an ' let warm water come a-floodin ' an ' a-flowin ' down over me . An ' they was a lady says you can do it ever ' day if you want . An '  --  them ladies ' committee come yet ? " " Uh-uh ! " said the girl . " An ' you jus ' set there an ' didn ' redd up the camp none ! " Ma gathered up the tin dishes as she spoke . ' ' We got to get in shape , " she said . " Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the groun ' . " She picked up the equipment , put the pans in their box and the box in the tent . " Get them beds neat , " she ordered . " I tell ya I ai n't never felt nothin ' so nice as that water . " Rose of Sharon listlessly followed orders . " Ya think Connie 'll be back today ? " " Maybe  --  maybe not . Ca n't tell . " " You sure he knows where-at to come ? " " Sure . " " Ma  --  ya don ' think  --  they could a killed him when they burned  --  ? " " Not him , " Ma said confidently . " He can travel when he wants  --  jackrabbit-quick an ' fox-sneaky . " " I wisht he 'd come . " " He 'll come when he comes . " " Ma --  " " I wisht you 'd get to work . " " Well , do you think dancin ' an ' play-actin ' is sins an 'll make me drop the baby ? "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hips . " Now what you talkin ' about ? You ai n't done no play-actin ' . " " Well , some folks here done it , an ' one girl , she dropped her baby  --  dead  --  an ' bloody , like it was a judgment . " Ma stared at her . " Who tol ' you ? " " Lady that come by . An ' that little fella in white clothes , he come by an ' he says that ai n't what done it . " Ma frowned . " Rosasharn , " she said , " you stop pickin ' at yourself . You 're jest a-teasin ' yourself up to cry . I don ' know what 's come at you . Our folks ai n't never did that . They took what come to ' em dry-eyed . I bet it 's that Connie give you all them notions . He was jes ' too big for his overhalls . " And she said sternly , " Rosasharn , you 're jest one person , an ' they 's a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I knowed people built theirself up with sin till they figgered they was big mean shucks in the sight a the Lord . " " But , Ma --  " " No . Jes ' shut up an ' git to work . You ai n't big enough or mean enough to worry God much . An ' I 'm gon na give you the back a my han ' if you don ' stop this pickin ' at yourself . " She swept the ashes into the fire hole and brushed the stones on its edge . She saw the committee coming along the road . " Git workin ' , " she said . " Here 's the ladies comin ' . Git a-workin ' now , so 's I can be proud . " She did n't look again , but she was conscious of the approach of the committee . There could be no doubt that it was the committee ; three ladies , washed , dressed in their best clothes : a lean woman with stringy hair and steel-rimmed glasses , a small stout lady with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mammothlady , big of hock and buttock , big of breast , muscledP427like a dray-horse , powerful and sure . And the committee walked down the road with dignity . Ma managed to have her back turned when they arrived . They stopped , wheeled , stood in a line . And the great woman boomed , " Mornin ' , Mis ' Joad , ai n't it ? " Ma whirled around as though she had been caught off guard . " Why , yes  --  yes . How 'd you know my name ? " " We 're the committee , " the big woman said . " Ladies ' Committee of Sanitary Unit Number Four . We got your name in the office . " Ma flustered , " We ai n't in very good shape yet . I 'd be proud to have you ladies come an ' set while I make up some coffee . " The plump committee woman said , " Give our names , Jessie . Mention our names to Mis ' Joad . Jessie 's the Chair , " she explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this here 's Annie Littlefieldan ' Ella Summers , an ' I 'm Jessie Bullitt . " " I 'm proud to make your acquaintance , " Ma said . " Wo n't you set down ? They ai n't nothin ' to set on yet , " she added . " But I 'll make up some coffee . " " Oh , no , " said Annie formally . " Do n't put yaself out . We jes ' come to call an ' see how you was , an ' try to make you feel at home . " Jessie Bullitt said sternly , " Annie , I 'll thank you to remember I 'm Chair . " " Oh ! Sure , sure . But next week I am . " " Well , you wait 'll next week then . We change ever ' week , " she explained to Ma . " Sure you wouldn ' like a little coffee ? " Ma asked helplessly .   8 " No , thank you . " Jessie took charge . " We gon na show you ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wanta , we 'll sign you up in the Ladies ' Club an ' give you duty . ' Course you don ' have to join . " " Does  --  does it cost much ? " " Do n't cost nothing but work . An ' when you 're knowed , maybe you can be ' lected to this committee , " Annie interrupted . " Jessie , here , is on the committee for the whole camp . She 's a big committee lady . " Jessie smiled with pride . " ' Lected unanimous , " she said . " Well , Mis ' Joad , I guess it 's time we tol ' you ' bout how the camp runs . " Ma said , " This here 's my girl , Rosasharn . " " How do , " they said . " Better come ' long too . " The huge Jessie spoke , and her manner was full of dignity and kindness , and her speech was rehearsed . " You shouldn ' think we 're a-buttin ' into your business , Mis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff ever'body uses . An ' we got rules we made ourself . Now we 're a-goin ' to the unit . That there , ever'body uses , an ' ever'body got to take care of it . " They strolled to the unroofed section where the wash trays were , twenty of them . Eight were in use , the women bending over , scrubbing the clothes , and the piles of wrung-out clothes were heaped on the clean concrete floor . " Now you can use these here any time you want , " Jessie said . " The on'y thing is , you got to leave ' em clean . " The women who were washing looked up with interest . Jessie said loudly , " This here 's Mis ' Joad an ' Rosasharn , come to live . " They greeted Ma in a chorus , and Ma made a dumpy little bow at them and said , " Proud to meet ya . " P429Jessie led the committee into the toilet and shower room . " I been here awready , " Ma said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what they 're for , " Jessie said . " An ' they 's the same rule . You got to leave ' em clean . Ever ' week they 's a new committee to swab out oncet a day . Maybe you 'll git on that committee . You got to bring your own soap . " " We got to get some soap , " Ma said . " We 're all out . " Jessie 's voice became almost reverential . " You ever used this here kind ? " she asked , and pointed to the toilets . " Yes , ma'am . Right this mornin ' . " Jessie sighed . " Tha 's good . " Ella Summers said , " Jes ' las ' week --  " Jessie interrupted sternly , " Mis ' Summers  --  I ' 11 tell . " Ella gave ground . " Oh , awright . " Jessie said , " Las ' week , when you was Chair , you done it all . I 'll thank you to keep out this week . " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , " said Jessie , " it ai n't this committee 's business to go a-blabbin ' , but I wo n't pass no names . Lady come in las ' week , an ' she got in here ' fore the committee got to her , an ' she had her of man 's pants in the toilet , an ' she says , It 's too low , an ' it ai n't big enough . Bust your back over her , ' she says . Why couldn ' they stick her higher ? ' " The committee smiled superior smiles . Ella broke in , " Says , Ca n't put ' nough in at oncet . ' " And Ella weathered Jessie 's stern glance . Jessie said , " We got our troubles with toilet paper . Rule says you ca n't take none away from here . " She clicked her tongue sharply . " Whole camp chips in for toilet paper . " For a moment she was silent , and then she confessed . " NumberFour is usin ' more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in general ladies ' meetin ' . Ladies ' side , Unit  --  Number Four is usin ' too much . ' Come right up in meetin ' ! " Ma was following the conversation breathlessly . " Stealin ' it  --  what for ? " " Well , " said Jessie , " we had trouble before . Las ' time they was three little girls cuttin ' paper dolls out of it . Well , we caught them . But this time we do n't know . Hardly put a roll out ' fore it 's gone . Come right up in meetin ' . One lady says we ought a have a little bell that rings ever ' time the roll turns oncet . Then we could count how many ever'body takes . " She shook her head . " I jes ' don ' know , " she said . " I been worried all week . Somebody 's a-stealin ' toilet paper from Unit Four . " From the doorway came a whining voice , " Mis ' Bullitt . " The committee turned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A flushed , perspiring woman stood in the doorway . " I couldn ' git up in meetin ' , Mis ' Bullitt . I jes ' couldn ' . They 'd a-laughed or somepin . " " What you talkin ' about ? " Jessie advanced . " Well , we-all  --  maybe  --  it 's us . But we ai n't a-stealin ' , Mis ' Bullitt . " Jessie advanced on her , and the perspiration beaded out on the flustery confessor . " We ca n't he'p it , Mis ' Bullitt . " " Now you tell what you 're tellin ' , " Jessie said . " This here unit 's suffered a shame ' bout that toilet paper . " " All week , Mis ' Bullitt . We couldn ' he'p it . You know I got five girls . " " What they been a-doin ' with it ? " Jessie demanded ominously . " Jes ' usin ' it . Hones ' , jes ' usin ' it . " " They ai n't got the right ! Four-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The confessor bleated , " Skitters . All five of ' em . We been low on money . They et green grapes . They all five got theP431howlin ' skitters . Run out ever ' ten minutes . " She defended them , " But they ai n't stealin ' it . " Jessie sighed . " You should a tol ' , " she said . " You got to tell . Here 's Unit Four sufferin ' shame ' cause you never tol ' . Anybodycan git the skitters . " The meek voice whined , " I jes ' ca n't keep ' em from eatin ' them green grapes . An ' they 're a-gettin ' worse all a time . " Ella Summers burst out , " The Aid . She ought a git the Aid . " " Ella Summers , " Jessie said , " I 'm a-tellin ' you for the las ' time , you ai n't the Chair . " She turned back to the raddled little woman . " Ai n't you got no money , Mis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , but we might git work any time . " " Now you hol ' up your head , " Jessie said . " That ai n't no crime . You jes ' waltz right over t ' the Weedpatch store an ' git you some grocteries . The camp got twenty dollars ' credit there . You git yourself fi ' dollars ' worth . An ' you kin pay it back to the Central Committee when you git work . Mis ' Joyce , you knowed that , " she said sternly . " How come you let your girls git hungry ? " " We ai n't never took no charity , " Mrs. Joyce said . " This ai n't charity , an ' you know it , " Jessie raged . " We had all that out . They ai n't no charity in this here camp . We wo n't have no charity . Now you waltz right over an ' git you some grocteries , an ' you bring the slip to me . " Mrs. Joyce said timidly , " S'pose we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long time . " " You 'll pay if you can . If you ca n't , that ai n't none of our business , an ' it ai n't your business . One fella went away , an ' two months later he sent back the money . You ai n't got the right to let your girls git hungry in this here camp . "   2Mrs . Joyce was cowed . " Yes , ma'am , " she said . " Git you some cheese for them girls , " Jessie ordered . " That 'll take care a them skitters . " " Yes , ma'am . " And Mrs. Joyce scuttled out of the door . Jessie turned in anger on the committee . " She got no right to be stiff-necked . She got no right , not with our own people . " Annie Littlefield said , " She ai n't been here long . Maybe she do n't know . Maybe she 's took charity one time-another . Nor , " Annie said , " do n't you try to shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass speech . " She turned half to Ma . " If a body 's ever took charity , it makes a burn that do n't come out . This ai n't charity , but if you ever took it , you do n't forget it . I bet Jessie ai n't ever done it . " " No , I ai n't , " said Jessie . " Well , I did , " Annie said . " Las ' winter ; an ' we was astarvin '  --  mean ' Pa an ' the little fellas . An ' it was a-rainin ' . Fella tol ' us to go to the Salvation Army . " Her eyes grew fierce . " We was hungry  --  they made us crawl for our dinner . They took our dignity . They  --  I hate ' em ! An '  --  maybe Mis ' Joyce took charity . Maybe she didn ' know this ai n't charity . Mis ' Joad , we do n't allow nobody in this camp to build theirselfup that-a-way . We do n't allow nobody to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the camp , an ' the camp can pass it out . We wo n't have no charity ! ' ' Her voice was fierce and hoarse . " I hate ' em , " she said . " I ai n't never seen my man beat before , but them  --  them Salvation Army done it to ' im . " Jessie nodded . " I heard , " she said softly , " I heard . We got to take Mis ' Joad aroun ' . " Ma said , " It sure is nice . " " Le 's go to the sewin ' room , " Annie suggested . " Got twop433machines . They 's a-quiltin ' , an ' they 're makin ' dresses . You might like to work over there . " When the committee called on Ma , Ruthie and Winfield faded imperceptibly back out of reach . " Why n't we go along an ' listen ? " Winfield asked . Ruthie gripped his arm . " No , " she said . " We got washed for them sons-a-bitches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winfield said , " You tol ' on me ' bout the toilet . I 'm a-gonna tell what you called them ladies . " A shadow of fear crossed Ruthie 's face . " Don ' do it . I tol ' ' cause I knowed you didn ' really break it . " " You did not , " said Winfield . Ruthie said , " Le 's look aroun ' . " They strolled down the line of tents , peering into each one , gawking self-consciously . At the end of the unit there was a level place on which a croquet court had been set up . Half a dozen children played seriously . In front of a tent an elderly lady sat on a bench and watched . Ruthie and Winfield broke into a trot . " Leave us play , " Ruthie cried . " Leave us get in . " The children looked up . A pig-tailed little girl said , " Nex ' game you kin . " " I wanta play now , " Ruthie cried . " Well , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruthie moved menacingly out on the court . " I 'm a-gonna play . " The pig-tails gripped her mallet tightly . Ruthie sprang at her , slapped her , pushed her , and wrested the mallet from her hands . " I says I was gon na play , " she said triumphantly . The elderly lady stood up and walked onto the court . Ruthie scowled fiercely and her hands tightened on the mallet . The lady said , " Let her play  --  like you done with Ralph las ' week . "   The children laid their mallets on the ground and trooped silently off the court . They stood at a distance and looked on with expressionless eyes . Ruthie watched them go . Then she hit a ball and ran after it . " Come on , Winfiel ' . Get a stick , " she called . And then she looked in amazement . Winfield had joined the watching children , and he too looked at her with expressionless eyes . Defiantly she hit the ball again . She kicked up a great dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children stood and watched . Ruthie lined up two balls and hit both of them , and she turned her back on the watching eyes , and then turned back . Suddenly she advanced on them , mallet in hand . " You come an ' play , " she demanded . They moved silently back at her approach . For a moment she stared at them , and then she flung down the mallet and ran crying for home . The children walked back on the court . Pigtails said to Winfield , " You can git in the nex ' game . " The watching lady warned them , " When she comes back an ' wants to be decent , you let her . You was mean yourself , Amy . " The game went on , while in the Joad tent Ruthie wept miserably . The truck moved along the beautiful roads , past orchards where the peaches were beginning to color , past vineyards with the clusters pale and green , under lines of walnut trees whose branches spread half across the road . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a sign : " No help wanted . No trespassing . " Al said , " Pa , they 's boun ' to be work when them fruits gets ready . Funny place  --  they tell ya they ai n't no work ' fore you ask ' em . " He drove slowly on.  |p435Pa  said , " Maybe we could go in anyways an ' ask if they know where they 's any work . Might do that . " A man in blue overalls and a blue shirt walked along the edge of the road . Al pulled up beside him . " Hey , mister , " Al said . " Know where they 's any work ? " The man stopped and grinned , and his mouth was vacant of front teeth . " No , " he said . " Do you ? I been walkin ' all week , an ' I ca n't tree none . " " Live in that gov'ment camp ? " Al asked . " Yeah ! " " Come on , then . Git up back , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the side-boards and dropped in the bed . Pa said , " I ai n't got no hunch we 'll find work . Guess we got to look , though . We do n't even know where-at to look . " " Shoulda talked to the fellas in the camp , " Al said . " How you feelin ' , Uncle John ? " " I ache , " said Uncle John . " I ache all over , an ' I got it comin ' . I ought a go away where I wo n't bring down punishmenton my own folks . " Pa put his hand on John 's knee . " Look here , " he said , " don ' you go away . We 're droppin ' folks all the time  --  Grampa an ' Granma dead , Noah an ' Connie  --  run out , an ' the preacher  --  in jail . " " I got a hunch we 'll see that preacher agin , " John said . Al fingered the ball on the gear-shift lever . " You don ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " The hell with it . Le 's go back an ' talk , an ' find out where they 's some work . We 're jus ' huntin ' skunks under water . " He stopped the truck and leaned out the window and called back , " Hey ! Lookie ! We 're a-goin ' back to the camp an ' try an ' see where they 's work . They ai n't no use burnin ' gas like this . "  |p436The  man leaned over the truck side . " Suits me , " he said . " My dogs is wore clean up to the ankle . An ' I ai n't even got a nibble . " Al turned around in the middle of the road and headed back . Pa said , " Ma 's gon na be putty hurt , ' specially when Tom got work so easy . " " Maybe he never got none , " Al said . " Maybe he jus ' went lookin ' , too . I wisht I could get work in a garage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like it . " Pa grunted , and they drove back toward the camp in silence . When the committee left , Ma sat down on a box in front of the Joad tent , and she looked helplessly at Rose of Sharon . " Well  --  " she said , " well  --  I ai n't been so perked up in years . Was n't them ladies nice ? " " I get to work in the nursery , " Rose of Sharon said . " They tol ' me . I can find out all how to do for babies , an ' then I 'll know . " Ma nodded in wonder . " Wouldn ' it be nice if the menfolks all got work ? " she asked . " Them a-workin ' , an ' a little money comin ' in ? " Her eyes wandered into space . " Them a-workin ' , an ' us a-workin ' here , an ' all them nice people . Fust thing we get a little ahead I 'd get me a little stove  --  nice one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd get a tent , big enough , an ' maybe secon ' - han ' springs for the beds . An ' we 'd use this here tent jus ' to eat under . An ' Sat'dy night we 'll go to the dancin ' . They says you can invite folks if you want . I wisht we had some frien 's to invite . Maybe the men 'll know somebody to invite . " P437Rose of Sharon peered down the road . " That lady that says I 'll lose the baby  --  " she began . " Now you stop that , " Ma warned her . Rose of Sharon said softly , " I seen her . She 's a-comin ' here , I think . Yeah ! Here she comes . Ma , do n't let her --  " Ma turned and looked at the approaching figure . " Howdy , " the woman said . " I 'm Mis ' Sandry  --  Lisbeth Sandry . I seen your girl this mornin ' . " " Howdy do , " said Ma . " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Ma . " Are you saved ? " " I been saved . " Ma 's face was closed and waiting . " Well , I 'm glad , " Lisbeth said . " The sinners is awful strong aroun ' here . You come to a awful place . They 's wicketness all around about . Wicket people , wicket goin's-on that a lamb ' - blood Christian jes ' ca n't hardly stan ' . They 's sinners all around us . " Ma colored a little , and shut her mouth tightly . " Seems to me they 's nice people here , " she said shortly . Mrs. Sandry 's eyes stared . " Nice ! " she cried . " You think they 're nice when they 's dancin ' an ' huggin ' ? I tell ya , ya eternal soul ai n't got a chancet in this here camp . Went out to a meetin ' in Weedpatch las ' night . Know what the preacher says ? He says , ' They 's wicketness in that camp . ' He says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He says , ' They 's dancin ' an ' huggin ' when they should be wailin ' an ' moanin ' in sin . ' That 's what he says . Ever'body that ai n't here is a black sinner , ' he says . I tell you it made a person feel puny good to hear ' im . An ' we knowed we was safe . We ai n't danced . " Ma 's face was red . She stood up slowly and faced Mrs. Sandry . " Git ! " she said . " Git out now , ' fore I git to be a sinner a-tellin ' you where to go . Git to your wailin ' an ' moanin ' . " Mrs. Sandry 's mouth dropped open . She stepped back . And then she became fierce . " I thought you was Christians . " " So we are , " Ma said . " No , you ai n't . You 're hell-burnin ' sinners , all of you ! An ' I 'll mention it in meetin ' , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see that innocent child in that there girl 's belly a-burnin ' . " A low wailing cry escaped from Rose of Sharon 's lips . Ma stooped down and picked up a stick of wood . " Git ! " she said coldly . " Don ' you never come back . I seen your kind before . You 'd take the little pleasure , wouldn ' you ? " Ma advanced on Mrs. Sandry . For a moment the woman backed away and then suddenly she threw back her head and howled . Her eyes rolled up , her shoulders and arms flopped loosely at her side , and a string of thick ropy saliva ran from the corner of her mouth . She howled again and again , long deep animal howls . Men and women ran up from the other tents , and they stood near  --  frightened and quiet . Slowly the woman sank to her knees and the howls sank to a shuddering , bubbling moan . She fell sideways and her arms and legs twitched . The white eyeballsshowed under the open eyelids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She got the sperit . " Ma stood looking down at the twitching form . The little manager strolled up casually . " Trouble ? " he asked . The crowd parted to let him through . He looked down at the woman . " Too bad , " he said . " Will some of you help get her back to her tent ? " The silent people shuffled their feet . Two men bent over and lifted the woman , onep439held her under the arms and the other took her feet . They carried her away , and the people moved slowly after them . Rose of Sharon went under the tarpaulin and lay down and covered her face with a blanket . The manager looked at Ma , looked down at the stick in her hand . He smiled tiredly . " Did you clout her ? " he asked . Ma continued to stare after the retreating people . She shook her head slowly . " No  --  but I would a . Twicet today she worked my girl up . " The manager said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She just is n't well . " And he added softly , " I wish she 'd go away , and all her family . She brings more trouble on the camp than all the rest together . " Ma got herself in hand again . " If she comes back , I might hit her . I ai n't sure . I wo n't let her worry my girl no more . " " Do n't worry about it , Mrs. Joad , " he said . " You wo n't ever see her again . She works over the newcomers . She wo n't ever come back . She thinks you 're a sinner . " " Well , I am , " said Ma . " Sure . Everbody is , but not the way she means . She is n't well , Mrs. Joad . " Ma looked at him gratefully , and she called , " You hear that , Rosasharn ? She ai n't well . She 's crazy . " But the girl did not raise her head . Ma said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes back , I ai n't to be trusted . I 'll hit her . " He smiled wryly . " I know how you feel , " he said . " But just try not to . That 's all I ask  --  just try not to . " He walked slowly away toward the tent where Mrs. Sandry had been carried . Ma went into the tent and sat down beside Rose of Sharon . " Look up , " she said . The girl lay still . Ala gently lifted the blanket from her daughter 's face . " That woman 's kinda0 crazy , " she said . " Do n't you believe none of them things . " Rose of Sharon whispered in terror , " When she said about burnin ' , I  --  felt burnin ' . " " That ai n't true , " said Ma . " I 'm tar 'd out , " the girl whispered . " I 'm tar 'd a things happenin ' . I wanta sleep . I wanta sleep . " " Well , you sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can sleep . " " But she might come back . " " She wo n't , " said Ma . " I 'm a-gonna set right outside , an ' I wo n't let her come back . Res ' up now , ' cause you got to get to work in the nu'sery purty soon . " Ma struggled to her feet and went to sit in the entrance to the tent . She sat on a box and put her elbows on her knees and her chin in her cupped hands . She saw the movement in the camp , heard the voices of the children , the hammering of an iron rim ; but her eyes were staring ahead of her . Pa , coming back along the road , found her there , and he squatted near her . She looked slowly over at him . " Git work ? " she asked . " No , " he said , ashamed . " We looked . " " Where 's Al and John and the truck ? " " Al 's fixin ' somepin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to fix her there . " Ma said sadly , " This here 's a nice place . We could be happy here awhile . " " If we could get work . " " Yeah ! If you could get work . " He felt her sadness , and studied her face . " What you a-mopin ' about ? If it 's sech a nice place why have you got to mope ? " She gazed at him , and she closed her eyes slowly . " Funny , P441ai n't it . All the time we was a-movin ' an ' shovin ' , I never thought none . An ' now these here folks been nice to me , been awful nice ; an ' what 's the first thing I do ? I go right back over the sad things  --  that night Grampa died an ' we buried him . I was all full up of the road , and bumpin ' and movin ' , an ' it was n't so bad . But now I come out here , an ' it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noah walkin ' away like that ! Walkin ' away jus ' down the river . Them things was part of all , an ' now they come a-flockin ' back . Granma a pauper , an ' buried a pauper . That 's sharp now . That 's awful sharp . An ' Noah walkin ' away down the river . He don ' know what 's there . He jus ' don ' know . An ' we don ' know . We ai n't never gon na know if he 's alive or dead . Never gon na know . An ' Connie sneakin ' away . I didn ' give ' em brain room before , but now they 're a-flockin ' back . An ' I ought a be glad ' cause we 're in a nice place . " Pa watched her mouth while she talked . Her eyes were closed . " I can remember how them mountains was , sharp as of teeth beside the river where Noah walked . I can remember how the stubble was on the groun ' where Grampa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home with a feather caught on it , all criss-crossed with cuts , an ' black with chicken blood . " Pa 's voice took on her tone . " I seen the ducks today , " he said . " Wedgin ' south  --  high up . Seems like they 're awful dinky . An ' I seen the blackbirds a-settin ' on the wires , an ' the doves was on the fences . " Ma opened her eyes and looked at him . He went on , " I seen a little whirhvin ' , like a man a-spinnin ' acrost a fiel ' . An ' the ducks drivin ' on down , wedgin ' on down to the southward . " Ma smiled . " Remember ? " she said . " Remember what we 'd always say at home ? Winter 's a-comin ' early , ' we said , when the ducks flew . Always said that , an ' winter come when itA was ready to come . But we always said , She 's a-comin ' early . ' I wonder what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wires , " said Pa . " Settin ' so close together . An ' the doves . Nothin ' sets so still as a dove  --  on the fence wires  --  maybe two , side by side . An ' this little whirlwin '  --  big as a man , an ' dancin ' off acrost a fiel ' . Always did like the little fellas , big as a man . " " Wisht I would n't think how it is home , " said Ma . " It ain'tour home no more . Wisht I 'd forget it . An ' Noah . " " He was n't ever right  --  I mean  --  well , it was my fault . " " I tor you never to say that . Woudn ' a lived at all , maybe . " " But I should a knowed more . " " Now stop , " said Ma . " Noah was strange . Maybe he 'll have a nice time by the river . Maybe it 's better so . We ca n't do no worryin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe you 'll get work right off . " Pa pointed at the sky . " Look  --  more ducks . Big bunch . An ' Ma , Winter 's a-comin ' early . ' "  --   --  She chuckled . " They 's things you do , an ' you don ' know why . " " Here 's John , " said Pa . " Come on an ' set , John . " Uncle John joined them . He squatted down in front of Ma . " We didn ' get nowheres , " he said . " Jus ' run aroun ' . Say , Al wants to see ya . Says he got to git a tire . Only one layer a cloth lcf ' , he says . " Pa stood up . " I hope he can git her cheap . We ai n't got much lef ' . Where is Al ? " " Down there , to the nex ' cross-street an ' turn right . Says gon na blow out an ' spoil a tube if we don ' get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes followed the giant V of ducks down the sky . Uncle John picked a stone from the ground and droppedp443it from his palm and picked it up again . He did not look at Ma . " They ai n't no work , " he said . " You didn ' look all over , " Ma said . " No , but they 's signs out . " " Well , Tom musta got work . He ai n't been back . " Uncle John suggested , " Maybe he went away  --  like Connie , or like Noah . " Ma glanced sharply at him , and then her eyes softened . " They 's things you know , " she said . " They 's stuff you 're sure of . Tom 's got work , an ' he 'll come in this evenin ' . That 's true . " She smiled in satisfaction . " Ai n't he a fine boy ! " she said . " Ai n't he a good boy ! " The cars and trucks began to come into the camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And each man carried clean overalls and shirt in his hand . Ma pulled herself together . " John , you go find Pa . Get to the store . I want beans an ' sugar an '  --  a piece of fryin ' meat an ' carrots an '  --  tell Pa to get somepin nice  --  anything  --  but nice  --  for tonight . Tonight  --  we 'll have  --  somepin nice . "   THE migrant people , scuttling for work , scrabbling to live , looked always for pleasure , dug for pleasure , manufactured pleasure , and they were hungry for amusement . Sometimes amusement lay in speech , and they climbed up their lives with jokes . And it came about in the camps along the roads , on the ditch banks beside the streams , under the sycamores , that the story teller grew into being , so that the people gathered in the low firelight to hear the gifted ones . And they listened while the tales were told , and their participation made the stories great . I was a recruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflected the dying fire . Them Injuns was cute  --  slick as snakes , an ' quiet when they wanted . Could go through dry leaves , an ' make no rustle . Try to do that sometime . And the people listened and remembered the crash of dry leaves under their feet . Come the change of season an ' the clouds up . Wrong time . Ever hear of the army doing anything right ? Give the army ten chances , an ' they 'll stumble along . Took three regiments to kill a hundred braves  --  always . And the people listened , and their faces were quiet with listening . The story tellers , gathering attention into theirI And perhaps a man balanced twenty cents between food and pleasure , and he went to a movie in Marysville or Tulare , in Ceres or Mountain View . And he came back to the ditch camp with his memory crowded . And he told how it was : They was this rich fella , an ' he makes like he 's poor , an ' they 's this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor too , an ' they meet in a hamburg ' stan ' . Why ? I do n't know why  --  that 's how it was . Why 'd they purtend like they 's poor ? Well , they 're tired of bein ' rich . Horseshit ! You want to hear this , or not ? Well , go on then . Sure , I wanta hear it , but if I was rich , if I was rich I 'd git so many pork chops  --  I 'd cord ' em up aroun ' me like wood , an ' I 'd eat my way out . Go on . Well , they each think the other one 's poor . An ' they git arrested an ' they git in jail , an ' they don ' git out ' cause the other one 'd find out the first one is rich . An ' the jail keeper , he 's mean to ' em ' cause he thinks they 're poor . Ought a see how he looks when he finds out . Jes ' nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jail for ? Well , they git caught at some kind a radical meetin ' but they ai n't radicals . They jes ' happen to be there . An ' they do n't each one wanta marry fur money , ya see . So the sons-of-bitches start lyin ' to each other right off . /Vell , in the pitcher it was like they was doin ' good . They 're nice to people , you see . I was to a show oncet that was me , an ' more'n me ; an ' my life , an ' more'n my life , so ever'thing was bigger . Well , I git enough sorrow . I like to git away from it . Sure  --  if you can believe it . P447So they got married , an ' then they foun ' out , an ' all them people that 's treated ' em mean . They was a fella had been uppity , an ' he nearly fainted when this fella come in with a plug hat on . Jes ' nearly fainted . An ' they was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet  --  funny as hell . And always , if he had a little money , a man could get drunk . The hard edges gone , and the warmth . Then there was no loneliness , for a man could people his brain with friends , and he could find his enemies and destroy them . Sittingin a ditch , the earth grew soft under him . Failures dulled and the future was no threat . And hunger did not skulk about , but the world was soft and easy , and a man could reach the place he started for . The stars came down wonderfullyclose and the sky was soft . Death was a friend , and sleep was death 's brother . The old times came back  --  a girl with pretty feet , who danced one time at home  --  a horse  --  a long time ago . A horse and a saddle . And the leather was carved . When was that ? Ought to find a girl to talk to . That 's nice . Might lay with her , too . But warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sadness and pleasure so close together , really the same thing . Like to stay drunk all the time . Who says it 's bad ? Who dares to say it 's bad ? Preachers  --  but they got their own kinda drunkenness . Thin , barren women , but they 're too miserable to know . Reformers  --  but they do n't bite deep enough into living to know . No  --  the stars are close and dear and I have joined the brotherhood of the worlds . And everything 's holy  --  everything , even me . A harmonica is easy to carry . Take it out of your hip pocket , knock it against your palm to shake out the dirt and pocket fuzz and bits of tobacco . Now it 's ready . You can do anything with a harmonica : thin reedy single tone , or chords , or melody with rhythm chords . You can mold the music with curved hands , making it wail and cry like bagpipes , making it full and round like an organ , making it as sharp and bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can play and put it back in your pocket . It is always with you , always in your pocket . And as you play , you learn new tricks , new ways to mold the tone with your hands , to pinch the tone with your lips , and no one teaches you . You feel around  --  sometimes alone in the shade at noon , sometimes in the tent door after supper when the women are washing up . Your foot taps gently on the ground . Your eyebrows rise and fall in rhythm . And if you lose it or break it , why , it 's no great loss . You can buy another for a quarter . A guitar is more precious . Must learn this thing . Fingers of the left hand must have callus caps . Thumb of the right hand a horn of callus . Stretch the left-hand fingers , stretch them like a spider 's legs to get the hard pads on the frets . This was my father 's box . Was n't no bigger'n a bug first time he give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good as him , he hardly never played no more . Used to set in the door , an ' listen an ' tap his foot . I 'm tryin ' for a break , an ' he 'd scowl mean till I get her , an ' then he 'd settle back easy , an ' he 'd nod . " Play , " he 'd say . " Play nice . " It 's a good box . See how the head is wore . They 's many a million songs wore down that wood an ' scooped her out . Some day she 'll cave in like a egg . But you ca n't patch her nor worry her no way or she 'll lose tone . Play her in the evening , an ' they 's a harmonica player in the nex ' tent . Makes it pretty nice together . The fiddle is rare , hard to learn . No frets , no teacher . Jes ' listen to a ol ' man an ' try to pick it up . Wo n't tell howp449to double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here 's how he done it . Shrill as a wind , the fiddle , quick and nervous and shrill . She ai n't much of a fiddle . Give two dollars for her . Fella says they 's fiddles four hundred years old , and they git mellowlike whisky . Says they 'll cost fifty-sixty thousan ' dollars . I do n't know . Soun 's like a lie . Harsh ol ' bastard , ai n't she ? Wanta dance ? I 'll rub up the bow with plenty rosin . Man ! Then she 'll squawk . Hear her a mile . These three in the evening , harmonica and fiddle and guitar . Playing a reel and tapping out the tune , and the big deep strings of the guitar beating like a heart , and the harmonica'ssharp chords and the skirl and squeal of the fiddle . People have to move close . They ca n't help it . " Chicken Reel " now , and the feet tap and a young lean buck takes three quick steps , and his arms hang limp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bare ground , beating dull , strike with your heels . Hands ' round and swing . Hair falls down , and panting breaths . Lean to the side now . Look at that Texas boy , long legs loose , taps four times for ever ' damn step . Never seen a boy swing aroun ' like that . Look at him swing that Cherokee girl , red in her cheeks an ' her toe points out . Look at her pant , look at her heave . Think she 's tired ? Think she 's winded ? Well , she ai n't . Texas boy got his hair in his eyes , mouth 's wide open , ca n't get air , but he pats four times for ever ' darn step , an ' he 'll keep a-going ' with the Cherokee girl . The fiddle squeaks and the guitar bongs . Mouth-organ man is red in the face . Texas boy and the Cherokee girl , pantin ' like dogs an ' a-beatin ' the groun ' . 01 ' folks Stan ' a-pattin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' their feet .   Back home  --  in the schoolhouse , it was . The big moon sailed off to the westward . An ' we walked , him an ' me  --  a little ways . Didn ' talk ' cause our throats was choked up . Didn ' talk none at all . An ' purty soon they was a haycock . Went right to it and laid down there . Seein ' the Texas boy an ' that girl a-steppin ' away into the dark  --  think nobody seen ' em go . Oh , God ! I wisht I was a-goin ' with that Texas boy . Moon 'll be up ' fore long . I seen that girl 's ol ' man move out to stop ' em , an ' then he didn ' . He knowed . Might as well stop the fall from comin ' , and might as well stop the sap from movin ' in the trees . An ' the moon 'll be up ' fore long . Play more  --  play the story songs  --  " As I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gone down . Be a shame to build her up . Little ol ' moon 'll be up ' fore long . Beside an irrigation ditch a preacher labored and the peoplecried . And the preacher paced like a tiger , whipping the people with his voice , and they groveled and whined on the ground . He calculated them , gauged them , played on them , and when they were all squirming on the ground he stooped down and of his great strength he picked each one up in his arms and shouted , Take ' em , Christ ! and threw each one in the water . And when they were all in , waist deep in the water , and looking with frightened eyes at the master , he knelt down on the bank and he prayed for them ; and he prayed that all men and women might grovel and whine on the ground . Men and women , dripping , clothes sticking tight , watched ; then gurgling and sloshing in their shoes they walked back to the camp , to the tents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they said . We 're washed white as snow . We wo n't never sin again . And the children , frightened and wet , whispered together : We been saved . We wo n't sin no more . Wisht I knowed what all the sins was , so I could do ' em . The migrant people looked humbly for pleasure on the roads.  | ON SATURDAY morning the wash tubs were crowded . The women washed dresses , pink ginghamsand flowered cottons , and they hung them in the sun and stretched the cloth to smooth it . When afternoon came the whole camp quickened and the people grew excited . The children caught the fever and were more noisy than usual . About mid-afternoon child bathing began , and as each child was caught , subdued , and washed , the noise on the playground gradually subsided . Before five , the children were scrubbed and warned about getting dirty again ; and they walked about , stiff in clean clothes , miserable with carefulness . At the big open-air dance platform a committee was busy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city dump had been visited for wire , every tool box had contributedfriction tape . And now the patched , spliced wire was strung out to the dance floor , with bottle necks as insulators . This night the floor would be lighted for the first time . By six o'clock the men were back from work or from looking for work , and a new wave of bathing started . By seven , dinnerswere over , men had on their best clothes : freshly washed overalls , clean blue shirts , sometimes the decent blacks . The girls were ready in their print dresses , stretched and clean , their hair braided and ribboned . The worried women watched the families and cleaned up the evening dishes . On the platform the string band practiced , surrounded by a double wall of children . The people were intentand excited . In the tent of Ezra Huston , chairman , the Central Committeeof five men went into meeting . Huston , a tall spare man , wind-blackened , with eyes like little blades , spoke to his committee , one man from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the word they was gon na try to bust up the dance ! " he said . The tubby little representative from Unit Three spoke up . " I think we ought a squash the hell out of ' em , an ' show ' em . " " No , " said Huston . " That 's what they want . No , sir . If they can git a fight goin ' , then they can run in the cops an ' say we ai n't orderly . They tried it before  --  other places . " He turned to the sad dark boy from Unit Two . " Got the fellas together to go roun ' the fences an ' see nobody sneaks in ? " The sad boy nodded . " Yeah ! Twelve . Tol ' ' em not to hit nobody . Jes ' push ' em out ag'in . " Huston said , " Will you go out an ' find Willie Eaton ? He 's chairman a the entertainment , ai n't he ? " " Yeah . " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The boy went out , and he returned in a moment with a stringy Texas man . Willie Eaton had a long fragile jaw and dust-colored hair . His arms and legs were long and loose , and he had the gray sunburned eyes of the Panhandle . He stood in the tent , grinning , and his hands pivoted restlessly on his wrists . Huston said , " You heard about tonight ? " Willie grinned . " Yeah ! " " Did anything ' bout it ? " " Yeah ! "   " Tell what you done . " Willie Eaton grinned happily . " Well , sir , ordinary ent ' - tainment committee is five . I got twenty more  --  all good strong boys . They 're a-gonna be a-dancin ' an ' a-keepin ' their eyes open an ' their ears open . First sign  --  any talk or argament , they close in tight . Worked her out purty nice . Ca n't even see nothing . Kinda move out , an ' the fella will go out with ' em . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Willie laughed gleefully . " I tol " em , " he said . " Well , tell ' em so they know . " " They know . Got five men out to the gate lookin ' over the folks that comes in . Try to spot ' em ' fore they git started . " Huston stood up . His steel-colored eyes were stern . " Now you look here , Willie . We do n't want them fellas hurt . They 's gon na be deputies out by the front gate . If you blood ' em up , why  --  them deputies 'll git you . " " Got that there figgered out , " said Willie . " Take ' em out the back way , into the fiel ' . Some a the boys 'll see they git on their way . " " Well , it soun 's awright , " Huston said worriedly . " But do n't you let nothing happen , Willie . You 're responsible . Don ' you hurt them fellas . Don ' you use no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " " No , sir , " said Willie . " We wo n't mark ' em . " Huston was suspicious . " I wisht I knowed could trus ' you , Willie . If you got to sock ' em , sock ' em where they wo n't bleed . " " Yes , sir ! " said Willie . " You sure of the fellas you picked ? " " Yes , sir . "  | " Awright . An ' if she gits outa han ' , I 'll be in the right-han ' corner , this way on the dance floor . " Willie saluted in mockery and went out . Huston said , " I du n no . I jes ' hope Willie 's boys do n't kill nobody . What the hell the deputies want to hurt the camp for ? Why ca n't they let us be ? " The sad boy from Unit Two said , " I lived out at Sunlan ' Lan ' an ' Cattle Company 's place . Honest to God , they got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faucet for ' bout two hundred people . " The tubby man said , " Jesus , God , Jeremy . You ai n't got to tell me . I was there . They got a block of shacks  --  thirtyfiveof ' em in a row , an ' fifteen deep . An ' they got ten crappersfor the whole shebang . An ' , Christ , you could smell ' em a mile . One of them deputies give me the lowdown . We was settin ' aroun ' , an ' he says , Them goddamn gov'ment camps , ' he says . Give people hot water , an ' they gon na want hot water . Give ' em flush toilets , an ' they gon na want ' em . ' He says , You give them goddamn Okies stuff like that an ' they 'll want ' em . ' An ' he says , They hol ' red meetin 's in them gov ' - ment camps . All figgerin ' how to git on relief , ' he says . " Huston asked , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They was a little fella , an ' he says , What you mean , relief ? ' " I mean relief  --  what us taxpayers puts in an ' you goddamnOkies takes out . ' " We pay sales tax an ' gas tax an ' tobacco tax , ' this little guy says . An ' he says , Farmers get four cents a cotton poun ' from the gov'ment  --  ai n't that relief ? ' An ' he says , Railroads an ' shippin ' companies draws subsidies  --  ai n't that relief ? ' " They 're doin ' stuff got to be done , ' this deputy says . " Well , ' the little guy says , how 'd your goddamn crops get picked if it was n't for us ? ' " The tubby man looked around . " What 'd the deputy say ? " Huston asked . " Well , the deputy got mad . An ' he says , You goddamn reds is all the time stirrin ' up trouble , ' he says . You better come along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an ' they give him sixty days in jail for vagrancy . " " How 'd they do that if he had a job ? " asked Timothy Wallace . The tubby man laughed . " You know better'n that , " he said . " You know a vagrant is anybody a cop do n't like . An ' that 's why they hate this here camp . No cops can get in . This here 's United States , not California . " Huston sighed . " Wisht we could stay here . Got to be goin ' ' fore long . I like this here . Folks gits along nice ; an ' , God Awmighty , why ca n't they let us do it ' stead of keepin ' us miserablean ' puttin ' us in jail ? I swear to God they gon na push us into fightin ' if they do n't quit a-worryin ' us . " Then he calmed his voice . " We jes ' got to keep peaceful , " he reminded himself . " The committee got no right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unit Three said , " Anybody that thinks this committee got all cheese an ' crackers ought to jes ' try her . They was a fight in my unit today  --  women . Got to callin ' names , an ' then got to throwin ' garbage . Ladies ' Committeecouldn ' handle it , an ' they come to me . Want me to bring the fight in this here committee . I tol ' ' em they got to handle women trouble theirselves . This here committee ai n't gon na mess with no garbage fights . " Huston nodded . " You done good , " he said . And now the dusk was falling , and as the darkness deep-P457ened the practicing of the string band seemed to grow louder . The lights flashed on and two men inspected the patched wire to the dance floor . The children crowded thickly about the musicians . A boy with a guitar sang the " Down Home Blues , " chording delicately for himself , and on his second chorus three harmonicas and a fiddle joined him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in their clean blue denim and women in their ginghams . They came near to the platform and then stood quietly waiting , their faces bright and intent under the light . Around the reservation there was a high wire fence , and along the fence , at intervals of fifty feet , the guards sat in the grass and waited . Now the cars of the guests began to arrive , small farmers and their families , migrants from other camps . And as each guest came through the gate he mentioned the name of the camper who had invited him . The string band took a reel tune up and played loudly , for they were not practicing any more . In front of their tents the Jesus-lovers sat and watched , their faces hard and contemptuous . They did not speak to one another , they watched for sin , and their faces condemned the whole proceeding . At the Joad tent Ruthie and Winfield had bolted what littledinner they had , and then they started for the platform . Ma called them back , held up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked into their nostrils , pulled their ears and looked inside , and sent them to the sanitary unit to wash their hands once more . They dodged around the back of the building and bolted for the platform , to stand among the children , close-packed about the band . Al finished his dinner and spent half an hour shaving with Tom 's razor . Al had a tight-fitting wool suit and a striped shirt , and he bathed and washed and combed his straight hair back . And when the washroom was vacant for a moment , he smiled engagingly at himself in the mirror , and he turned and tried to see himself in profile when he smiled . He slipped his purple arm-bands on and put on his tight coat . And he rubbed up his yellow shoes with a piece of toilet paper . A late bather came in , and AI hurried out and walked recklessly toward the platform , his eye peeled for girls . Near the dance floor he saw a pretty blond girl sitting in front of a tent . He sidled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Gon na dance tonight ? " he asked . The girl looked away and did not answer . " Ca n't a fella pass a word with you ? How ' bout you an ' me dancin ' ? " And he said nonchalantly , " I can waltz . " The girl raised her eyes shyly , and she said , " That ai n't nothin '  --  anybody can waltz . " " Not like me , " said Al . The music surged , and he tapped one foot in time . " Come on , " he said . A very fat woman poked her head out of the tent and scowled at him . " You git along , " she said fiercely . " This here girl 's spoke for . She 's a-gonna be married , an ' her man 's a-comin ' for her . " Al winked rakishly at the girl , and he tripped on , striking his feet to the music and swaying his shoulders and swinging his arms . And the girl looked after him intently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on , John , " he said ; and he explained to Ma , " We 're a-gonna talk to some fellas about gettin ' work . " And Pa and Uncle John walked toward the manager 's house . Tom worked a piece of store bread into the stew gravy onp459his plate and ate the bread . He handed his plate to Ma , and she put it in the bucket of hot water and washed it and handed it to Rose of Sharon to wipe . " Ai n't you goin ' to the dance ? " Ma asked . " Sure , " said Tom . " I 'm on a committee . We 're gon na entertainsome fellas . " " Already on a committee ? " Ma said . " I guess it 's ' cause you got work . " Rose of Sharon turned to put the dish away . Tom pointed at her . " My God , she 's a-gettin ' big , " he said . Rose of Sharon blushed and took another dish from Ma . " Sure she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gettin ' prettier , " said Tom . The girl blushed more deeply and hung her head . " You stop it , " she said , softly . " ' Course she is , " said Ma . " Girl with a baby always gets prettier . " Tom laughed . " If she keeps a-swellin ' like this , she gon na need a wheelbarra to carry it . " " Now you stop , " Rose of Sharon said , and she went inside the tent , out of sight . Ma chuckled , " You shouldn ' ought to worry her . " " She likes it , " said Tom . " I know she likes it , but it worries her , too . And she 's a-mournin ' for Connie . " " Well , she might 's well give him up . He 's prob'ly studyin ' to be President of the United States by now . " " Do n't worry her , " Ma said . " She ai n't got no easy row to hoe . " Willie Eaton moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom Joad ? "  | " Yeah . " " Well , I 'm Chairman the Entertainment Committee . We gon na need you . Fella tol ' me ' bout you . " " Sure , I 'll play with you , " said Tom . " This here 's Ma . " " Howdy , " said Willie . " Glad to meet ya . " Willie said , " Gon na put you on the gate to start , an ' then on the floor . Want ya to look over the guys when they come in , an ' try to spot ' em . You 'll be with another fella . Then later I want ya to dance an ' watch . " " Yeah ! I can do that awright , " said Tom . Ma said apprehensively , " They ai n't no trouble ? " " No , ma'am , " Willie said . " They ai n't gon na be no trouble . " " None at all , " said Tom . " Well , I 'll come ' long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two young men walked quickly away toward the main gate . Ma piled the washed dishes on a box . " Come on out , " she called , and when there was no answer , " Rosasharn , you come out . The girl stepped from the tent , and she went on with the dish-wiping . " Tom was on'y jollyin ' ya . " " I know . I did n't mind ; on'y I hate to have folks look at me . " Ai n't no way to he'p that . Folks gon na look . But it makes folks happy to see a girl in a fambly way  --  makes folks sort of giggly an ' happy . Ai n't you a-goin ' to the dance ? " " I was  --  but I don ' know . I wisht Connie was here . " Her voice rose . " Ma , I wisht he was here . I ca n't hardly stan ' it . " Ma looked closely at her . " I know , " she said . " But , Rosasharn  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don ' aim to , Ma . " " Well , do n't you shame us . We got too much on us now , without no shame . " The girl 's lip quivered . " I  --  I ain ' goin ' to the dance . I couldn '  --  Ma  --  he'p me ! " She sat down and buried her head in her arms . Ma wiped her hands on the dish towel and she squatted down in front of her daughter , and she put her two hands on Rose of Sharon 's hair . " You 're a good girl , " she said . " You always was a good girl . I 'll take care a you . Do n't you fret . " She put an interest in her tone . " Know what you an ' me 's gon na do ? We 're a-goin ' to that dance , an ' we 're a-gonna set there an ' watch . If anybody says to come dance  --  why , I 'll say you ai n't strong enough . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the music an ' all like that . " Rose of Sharon raised her head . " You wo n't let me dance ? " " No , I wo n't . " " An ' don ' let nobody touch me . " " No , I wo n't . " The girl sighed . She said desperately , " I don ' know what I 'm a-gonna do , Ma . I jus ' don ' know . I don ' know . " Ma patted her knee . " Look , " she said . " Look here at me . I 'm a-gonna tell ya . In a little while it ai n't gon na be so bad . In a little while . An ' that 's true . Now come on . We 'll go get washed up , an ' we 'll put on our nice dress an ' we 'll set by the dance . " She led Rose of Sharon toward the sanitary unit . Pa and Uncle John squatted with a group of men by the porch of the office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We was jus ' a few minutes late . They awready got two fellas . An ' , well , sir , it was a funny thing . They 's a straw boss there , an ' he says , We jus ' got some two-bit men . ' Course we could use twenty-cent men . We can use a lot a twentycentmen . You go to your camp an ' say we 'll put a lot a fellas on for twenty cents . ' " The squatting men moved nervously . A broad-shouldered man , his face completely in the shadow of a black hat , spatted his knee with his palm . " I know it , goddamn it ! " he cried . " An ' they 'll git men . They 'll git hungry men . You ca n't feed your fam'ly on twenty cents an hour , but you 'll take anything . They got you goin ' an ' comin ' . They jes ' auction a job off .

The circle was silent for him . " Well  --  I jus ' thought , if a fella had a acre . Well , my woman she could raise a little truck an ' a couple pigs an ' some chickens .

" Black Hat raised his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his stringy neck where the whiskers lay flat like fur . " Yeah ! " he said bitterly . " You 'll do that . An ' I 'm a two-bit man .

" I ca n't starve so 's you can get two bits . " Black Hat dipped his head again , and his chin went into the shadow . " I du n no , " he said . " I jes ' du n no .

I ca n't think all the time , goddamn it ! It drives a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet nervously . Tom stood at the gate and watched the people coming in to the dance . A floodlight shone down into their faces . Willie Eaton said , " Jes ' keep your eyes open . I 'm sendin ' Jule Vitela over . He 's half Cherokee . Nice fella . Keep your eyes open . An ' see if you can pick out the ones . " " O.K. , " said Tom . He watched the farm families come in , the girls with braided hair and the boys polished for the dance . Jule came and stood beside him . " I 'm with you , " he said . Tom looked at the hawk nose and the high brown cheek bones and the slender receding chin . " They says you 're half Injun . You look all Injun to me. " tP464 " No , " said Jule . " Jes ' half . Wisht I was a full-blood . I 'd have my lan ' on the reservation . Them full-bloods got it pretty nice , some of ' em . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The guests were moving in through the gateway , families from the farms , migrants from the ditch camps . Children straining to be free and quiet parents holding them back . Jule said , " These here dances done funny things . Our peoplegot nothing , but jes ' because they can ast their frien 's to come here to the dance , sets ' em up an ' makes ' em proud . An ' the folks respects ' em ' count of these here dances . Fella got a little place where I was a-workin ' . He come to a dance here . I ast him myself , an ' he come . Says we got the only decent dance in the county , where a man can take his girls an ' his wife . Hey ! Look . " Three young men were coming through the gate  --  young working men in jeans . They walked close together . The guard at the gate questioned them , and they answered and passed through . " Look at ' em careful , " Jule said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three ? " he asked . " Fella named Jackson , Unit Four . " Jule came back to Tom . " I think them 's our fellas . " " How ya know ? " " I du n no how . Jes ' got a feelin ' . They 're kinda scared . Foller ' em an ' tell Willie to look ' em over , an ' tell Willie to check with Jackson , Unit Four . Get him to see if they 're all right . I 'll stay here . " Tom strolled after the three young men . They moved toward the dance floor and took their positions quietly on the edge of the crowd . Tom saw Willie near the band and signaled him . P465 " What cha want ? " Willie asked . " Them three  --  see  --  there ? " " Yeah . " " They say a fella name ' Jackson , Unit Four , ast ' em . " Willie craned his neck and saw Huston and called him over . " Them three fellas , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an ' see if he ast ' em . " Huston turned on his heel and walked away ; and in a few moments he was back with a lean and bony Kansan . " This here 's Jackson , " Huston said . " Look , Jackson , see them three young fellas  --  ? " " Yeah . " " Well , did you ast ' em ? " " No . " " Ever see ' em before ? " Jackson peered at them . " Sure . Worked at Gregorio 's with ' em . " " So they knowed your name . " " Sure . I worked right beside ' em . " " Awright , " Huston said . " Do n't you go near ' em . We ai n't gon na th'ow ' em out if they 're nice . Thanks , Mr. Jack-son . " " Good work , " he said to Tom . " I guess them 's the fellas . " " Jule picked ' em out , " said Tom . " Hell , no wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em . Well , I 'll point ' em out to the boys . " A sixteen-year-old boy came running through the crowd . He stopped , panting , in front of Huston . " Mista Huston , " he said . " I been like you said . They 's a car with six men parked down by the euc'lyptus trees , an ' they 's one with four men up that north-side road . I ast ' em for a match . They got guns . I seen ' em . " P466 Huston 's eyes grew hard and cruel . " Willie , " he said , " you sure you got ever'thing ready ? " Willie grinned happily . " Sure have , Mr. Huston . Ai n't gon na be no trouble . " " Well , do n't hurt ' em . ' Member now . If you kin , quiet an ' nice , I kinda like to see ' em . Be in my tent . " " I 'll see what we kin do , " said Willie . Dancing had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform . " Choose up your squares , " he called . The music stopped . Boys and girls , young men and women , ran about until eight squares were ready on the big floor , ready and waiting . The girls held their hands in front of them and squirmed their fingers . The boys tapped their feet restlessly . Around the floor the old folks sat , smiling slightly , holding the children back from the floor . And in the distance the Jesus-lovers sat with hard condemning faces and watched the sin . Ma and Rose of Sharon sat on a bench and watched . And as each boy asked Rose of Sharon as partner , Ma said , " No , she ai n't well . " And Rose of Sharon blushed and her eyes were bright . The caller stepped to the middle of the floor and held up his hands . " All ready ? Then let her go ! " The music snarled out " Chicken Reel , " shrill and clear , fiddle skirling , harmonicas nasal and sharp , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the turns , the squares moved . And they danced forward and back , hands ' round , swing your lady . The caller , in a frenzy , tapped his feet , strutted back and forth , went through the figures as he called them . " Swing your ladies an ' a dol ce do . Join han 's roun ' an ' P467away we go . " The music rose and fell , and the moving shoes beating in time on the platform sounded like drums . " Swing to the right an ' a swing to lef ' ; break , now  --  breakbackto  --  back , " the caller sang the high vibrant monotone . Now the girls ' hair lost the careful combing . Now perspirationstood out on the foreheads of the boys . Now the expertsshowed the tricky inter-steps . And the old people on the edge of the floor took up the rhythm , patted their hands softly , and tapped their feet ; and they smiled gently and then caught one another 's eyes and nodded . Ma leaned her head close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wouldn ' think it , but your Pa was as nice a dancer as I ever seen , when he was young . " And Ma smiled . " Makes me think of of times , " she said . And on the faces of the watchers the smiles were of old times . " Up near Muskogee twenty years ago , they was a blin ' man with a fiddle --  " " I seen a fella oncet could slap his heels four times in one jump . " " Swedes up in Dakota  --  know what they do sometimes ? Put pepper on the floor . Gits up the ladies ' skirts an ' makes ' em purty lively  --  lively as a filly in season . Swedes do that sometimes . " In the distance , the Jesus-lovers watched their restive children . " Look on sin , " they said . " Them folks is ridin ' to hell on a poker . It 's a shame the godly got to see it . " And their children were silent and nervous . " One more roun ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caller chanted . " Hit her hard , ' cause we 're gon na stop soon . " And the girls were damp and flushed , and they danced with open mouths and serious reverent faces , and the boys flung back their
