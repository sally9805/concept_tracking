Everyone who is really for Democracy and hates Right &; Left - isms had good cause to stand up and cheer last week , as Premier Camille Chautemps fought and won the greatest battle of his career . The grave crisis the Premier faced was really three crises rolled into one : <P> Labor Crisis : Something had to be done to stave off trouble after the expiration on March 1 of some 7,000 labor contracts , affecting workers in every part of France . Ugly signs of labor unrest have been appearing for several months , and last week there were grounds to fear another wave of sit-down strikes and stand-up riots such as burst forth under Socialist Premier Lon Blum ( TIME , June 15 , 1936 ) , today Vice-Premier . <P> Revolutionary Crisis : Since last November , in view of the great quantities of arms , ammunition and bombs seized by the French Secret Service , it has been certain that there are in France sizable groups determined to overthrow the Republic by force . Proletarian leaders have not hesitated to accuse Socialist Vice-Premier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interior from making use of evidence which might condemn two Rightists , whose names are household words in France , the No. 1 munitions maker , de Wendel , and the No. 1 tire maker , Michelin . On the other hand , exasperated Frenchmen in circles close to the Church and the General Staff have their list of Communists , proletarian militants and officials of the Soviet Embassy in Paris whom they accuse of preparing a Leftist coup d ' tat . <P> Parliamentary Crisis : Since free France is still continental Europe 's greatest Democracy , her battle of last week was fought in the Chamber &; Senate . In case Chautemps &; Friends did not win , there was a good chance not only of an eruption of strikes , but a general strike followed by God knew what . <P> The parliamentary battle was waged around six bills which Premier Chautemps calls his " Modern Labor Charter , " and which represent a great constructive effort to create , by democratic means and with democratic checks , a French State authority strong enough to arbitrate and enforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7,000 contracts expiring March 1 were not permitted to expire last week while the parliamentary battle raged , for the Chamber &; Senate calendar was kept day after day at February 28 , and thus officially time stood still . <P> The Charter . The formulas by which studiously Middle-Class Camille Chautemps hoped to achieve social peace : <P> In case a strike is about to be called , a plebiscite on the issue must first be held among workers in the plant concerned , by secret ballot . Coercion by trade union leaders or employers is thus theoretically held at arm 's length . The Premier believes that this will result in the workers themselves democratically blocking hundreds of incipient strikes . <P> The cost of living has now risen and is still rising in France at such a rate that wages must obviously be further raised- members of the Chamber took time out recently to raise their own pay-and the new charter adopts a variant of the system existing in Belgium , where most labor contracts provide for automatic revision of wages up or down in step with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
