txt A proposal by George L. Berry , president of the Printing Pressmen 's Union , for arbitration of the controversy between the American Federation of Labor and the Committee for Industrial Organization was rejected today soon after it had been made . Members of the A. F. of L. executive council unanimously opposed arbitration of the dispute and determined upon drastic proceedings against the ten unions suspended Sept. 5 because they refused to withdraw from the C. I. 0. , which had been held to be a dual or rival labor federation . At the end of the council meeting William Green , president of the A. F. of L. , announced that the question of whether the dissident unions should be expelled would be settled by the federation convention , which opens here Monday . " The situation has not developed to a point where we are able to form an opinion as to how the delegates feel , " Mr. Green said . " The entire subject-matter will be referred to a committee , which will draft a report to the convention , which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not predict now . The committee report will probably be acted upon a week after the convention opens its sessions . " Line-Up of the Council The council , which governs the affairs of the federation between conventions , has seventeen members , of whom sixteen are expected to attend the convention . Of these , it was said in reliable quarters today that , to put it conservatively , ten were united in a bloc opposed to John L. Lewis , head of the C. I. 0. , two at the most were pro-Lewis and four were " on the fence . " Those who favor expulsion of the ten C. I. 0 . unions have been urging the wavering council members to join them , pointing to the Lewis group 's welcoming of two unions held to be dual as proof that the president of the United Mine Workers intended to form a rival federation . Since the United Radio and Electrical Workers Union and the Industrial Union of Shipyard Workers joined the C. I 0 . last week the anti-Lewis bloc has gained in influence and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become more insistent . Before the issue is carried to a showdown , however , there will be a quiet canvass of sentiment among key unions to learn which way they are likely to vote and to learn whether there is any possibility that they would desert the federation if Mr. Lewis announced the official formation of an independent organization . Especially does the council wish to know where the brewery workers and the bakery workers unions stand . These unions , at their recent conventions , deplored the suspension of the C. I. 0 . unions and urged organization of the mass production industries along industrial lines . That they would vote against revocation of the charters of the C. I. 0 . is assumed here , but whether they would join the Lewis bloc is uncertain . Much Manoeuvring in View Expediency will probably play a large part in the convention moves . The action by the anti-Lewis leaders will be calculated to throw the blame on him for splitting open the labor movement . The other side will probably jockey to throw that blame on the act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an act allegedly contrary to the federation 's Constitution . There has been a considerable increase in sympathy for Mr. Green since he was cited by Mr. Lewis to appear before the miners international executive board next Wednesday to answer a charge of consorting and conspiring with enemies of the miners union . If there was any chance that Mr. Green would be jettisoned at this convention the action of Mr. Lewis is said to have removed that possibility . That action , however , has stimulated further discussion concerning Mr. Green 's future and concerning possible reforms in the work of the federation in the near future . A veritable hornets ' nest has been stirred up by John P. Frey , president of the metal trades department , the convention of which , just concluded , adopted a boycott against the label of the International Typographical Union because C. P. Howard , its president , is a member of the C. I. 0 . The resolution stated that the metal unions would refuse to use the printers ' label " until his Howard 's organization compels him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0 . " In nearly all large cities the label of the printing trades is a joint symbol , put out under the auspices of the city 's allied printing trades council . In these councils are the photo-engravers , the pressmen , the stereotypers and other unions . Concerned Over Boycott The printing unions not affiliated with the C. I. 0 . are gravely concerned over the boycott , since they would be affected if the metal trade unions withdrew patronage from union printing shops in cities where the combined label is in use . Mr. Frey said today he would lead a fight in the credentials committee against at least two delegates from central labor bodies who , be said , were Communists and organizers for the C. I. 0 . He did not give their names . He added that if Mr. Howard and Max Zaritsky , president of the United Hatters , Cap and Millinery Workers Union , appeared here he would also contest their seating . He declared that he regarded Mr. Zaritsky , who attended the meeting of the C. 1 . 0 . in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an individual , a status he also ascribed to Mr. Howard . Mr. Green , however , has stated that be does not consider Mr. Zaritsky a member of the C. I. 0 . because the millinery division which he headed when he joined the C. I. 0 . has been merged with the Hatters division to form a new national union . Mr. Zaritsky told the C. I. 0 . meeting last week that he considered himself a loyal member of the C. I. 0 . If members of any of the suspended C. I. 0 . unions are sent as delegates by central labor bodies or State labor federations , it is reported , they will be seated in the convention . The federation has taken no action against C. I. 0 . unions in these city and State bodies . Thus J. C. Lewis , president of the Iowa State Federation of Labor , who is a member of the Miners Union but is here as a delegate from his State federation , will be seated , it was said . Berry Gives Interview Major Berry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitration proposal in an interview today . He urged that arbitration be used to avert a " tragic " split in organized labor 's ranks . He is expected to transmit his proposals officially to both sides later . " I suggest appointment of a committee made up of equal numbers from each side with a neutral arbiter , with the majority decision to be accepted in advance by all , " Major Berry said . " This course , it seems to me , would be in entire harmony with the policy pursued by the A. F. of L. since its organization . " Labor has insisted upon this principle in its dealings with employers . Why not in its own affairs ? " He emphasized that he spoke as president of the International Printing Pressmen and Assistants Union and not as a Federal official . " The proposal will probably not be acceptable to either side , " commented Mr. Green . " The executive council suggested the only possible peace plan . " Mr. Frey declared : " If the Berry proposal is good now it was equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was equally good when the C. I. 0 . was refusing to meet with a committee of the A. F. of L. , to consider the entire controversy . Uses Civil War Analogy " The proposal that the North and South appoint a committee to adjust their growing differences and if necessary have a third man on the board before Fort Sumter was fired upon would have been of practical value . But after Fort Sumter was attacked and the Stars and Bars flew in actual rebellion against the United States the day for conciliation and arbitration had passed . There was but one thing for the United States to do and that Was to put down the rebellion . " John Coefield , president of the United Association of Plumbers and Steamfitters , asserted that the Berry proposal smacked of governmental interference in labor affairs . Arthur 0 . Wharton , president of the International Association of Machinists , rejected the proposal and said it reminded him of a suggestion that intimate domestic relationships be arbitrated . Matthew Woll of the Photo-Engravers Union declined to comment until the council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of the Building Trades Department , said that the proposal , " coming from a professional politician , " was not acceptable to him . A conference in an effort to settle The Seattle Post-Intelligencer strike will probably be held here soon , Mr. Green declared . He was asked concerning such a possibility after it had been learned that two men prominent in the disputing sides were here . These are David Beck of Seattle , president of the District Council of Teamsters , and Harvey J. Kelly , labor adviser to the Hearst publications . Mr. Green also said that the council meeting went over the plans for the opening of the convention next week . Those invited to speak are Secretary Perkins , Senator Wagner , Claude Pepper and C. 0 . Andrews , the new Florida Senators ; 1 David Lilienthal of the TVA : John G. Winant , former chairman of the Social Security Board , and A. J. Altmyer , a member of the Social Security Board .                 @ @ @ @
