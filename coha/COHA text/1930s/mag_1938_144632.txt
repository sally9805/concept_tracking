The Broadway season , like the oyster season , is restricted to months with an r in them . With only one more show , a musical , opening this season and with such hits as Hooray for What ! and Of Mice and Men already closed , it was plain last week that few producers were running the risk of theatrical ptomaine . But 1937-38 was eupeptic . No really bad play landed on its feet , though several got passing marks almost entirely through star acting : Susan and God because of Gertrude Lawrence , Whiteoaks because of Ethel Barrymore , Once Is Enough because of Ina Claire . Further , it was a season in which , from start to finish , the critics acted as pacesetters : No-play they panned became a hit , and none they cheered turned out a flop . <P> Of the season 's 96 productions , some 50% were flops , however , while 19 shows ran 100 performances or better . The general average of 53.4 performances ( as of June 1 ) creditably topped last season 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was : <P> 1 ) The Mercury Theatre , which first made headlines with Julius Caesar , the season 's most exciting stunt , and thereafter stayed continuously on the front page with The Cradle Will Rock , the season 's most original form of entertainment ; The Shoemakers ' Holiday , the season 's most rollicking revival ; Heartbreak House , the season 's most difficult play to revive . Synonymous with the Mercury Theatre was Actor-Director Orson Welles . <P> 2 ) The Federal Theatre , which has three hits in Manhattan : the Living Newspaper " . . . one third of a nation . . . " , a smashing exposure of slum conditions ; what might be called the Living Pulp Magazine Haiti which , played in Harlem with all the stops pulled out , is whacking good melodrama ; Prologue to Glory , no great shakes as a play , but redeemed by the acting of Stephen Courtleigh as the young Abe Lincoln . <P> 3 ) The sceneryless stage , which for a while scared stage designers as a nudist epidemic would scare dressmakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its meaning , by giving Our Town the universality of Everytown . <P> 4 ) A trend toward mysticism , which expressed itself in three smash hits ( Our Town , Shadow and Substance , On Borrowed Time ) as well as in some lesser fry . But all these plays , warmed by humor or pricked by wit , were far removed from the solemn fudge of the Servant in the House era , made neither God nor Death embarrassing . On Borrowed Time , though pleasant , was very likely the most overrated play of the season . But Our Town ( the Pulitzer Prize play ) , despite a third act which got beyond its depth , squeezed so much honest feeling , poetry and humor into its first two acts as to be , if not technically the season 's best play , its most notable event in the theatre . Best play technically : Of Mice and Men , ( which won the New York Drama Critics ' Circle Award ) . <P> The season produced no first-rate comedy , and , though its biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play with social significance . ( Of Mice and Men and Golden Boy had social material , but no major social theme . ) But social significance ran away with the musical field , providing a tense , pounding strike drama in The Cradle Will Rock , a fresh , spirited revue in Pins and Needles . Best of the straight musicals : Hooray for What ! , thanks to the clowning of Ed Wynn , the music of Harold Arlen.
