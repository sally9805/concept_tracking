COLD ROAST LAMB A STORY BY CHARLES CALDWELL DOBIE T HE price of spring Iamb was outrageous , yet Hester Lance decided to take no thought of expense . She laughed softly to herself at the memory of the playful thrusts with which her husband always pierced her spasmodic financial caution . How he would enjoy her confession that even in this instance she had entertained a fleeting impulse toward economy ! And strawberries in April for a shortcake , too ! What a feast they would have ! Begoni , the proprietor of the market , offered to send everything around in half an hour . Hester smiled back her refusal . No , she was n't trusting anybody to-day . She would carry everything herself ; it was only a block to her apartment anyway . At this Begoni 's dark eyes twinkled . " Who 's the big guest ? " he asked chuckling . " My husband ! " she threw at him , her voice thrilling with almost youthful vibrance . " He 's been away three months ! " " Ah ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She felt herself blushing . These Italians ! Really they were terrible . Yet , somehow , even their indelicacies had a certain naive friendliness . She decided to nod back at him gaily instead of frowning . What difference did a little questionable familiarity make on such a day ? At the bakery it was the same . Seeing her weighted down with so many bundles , the little Swedish woman in charge had said : " Leave them here , Mrs. Lance . I 'll have my boy carry them home for you when he comes in . " But Hester would have none of it . " No , it 's really nothing ! You see my husband is coming home ! " The Swedish woman understood . She knew the feeling . Had n't her dead husband been a seafaring man ? " Every time his ship made port , " she admitted , " I was excited and happy . And I always planned a feast  --  things he liked . For one thing , we always had herring salad . Men are all alike , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America is so full of divorce . The women cook so badly . " Well , she tossed back , nations , like individuals , had different ways of " holding " men . She was thankful that she never had to take any thought on that score . Cooking or no cooking , she held hers . And with this last prideful fling , she gathered her bundles together and departed . Bush Street was glistening from the effects of an April shower  --  about the only traditional trick of weather , barring a blustery March , in which San Francisco climate ever indulged . The sun had come out , glowing and warm , and waves of steam rose from the cement sidewalks . Broken lines of automobiles rolled with unusual caution down the slippery street , scattering water and mud from depressions in the asphalt . The caprices of the skies had kept cautious females indoors for the most part all day , but ROW . with the dinner hour an imminent possibility , the laggards were swarming into the corner groceries , intent on indifferently replenishing scant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ males . Hester had been a bit beforehand it scarcely had turned five o'clock  --  and she felt a measure of triumph and superiority . She always resented these women who seemed suddenly to come out of a daze of bridge-playing or telephone gossiping or arrant idling to the realization of an impending dinner hour . In her six months of apartment-house dwelling she had learned to know the faces of these women . Time upon time , especially during Philip Lancers absence , she had met them scampering out at the hour when they should have been making mayonnaise and shelling peas instead of buying them bottled or canned in order to save time and energy . She had to admit one thing in their favor : they always were resplendent in crisp house dresses and freshly marceled hair , their rouged nails polished to shining inefficiency . At least the day of red wrappers and curl papers and grubby fingers was over . If they held their males at all , it was not by the culinary methods commended by the bakery-woman . But , in a way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mightily for the fleshpots . Yet Hester Lance ! reserved the right to fancy that her culinary beguilements were secondary , a sort of accessory to the fact of some less prosaic quality . She liked to think that a matrimonial success of fifteen years ' duration could be a trifle independent of domesticexcellence . She had the pride of her skill at housekeeping , so much pride that , in the face of her husband 's breakdown , she had welcomed the chance to minister directly to his fastidious needs . She never regretted the twelve-room house in West Clay Park . There were too many compensations in drawing closer the ties which bound her to Philip Lancel , Somehow , the fact of a more circumscribed menage seemed fraught with tender revivals . But the experiment had failed . Philip 's necessity had gone beyond personal comforts . " A change  --  a complete break in the damnable monotony ! " That had been the doctor 's final decision . Damnable monotony ! It was not a flattering phrase for any wife to hear in connection with a husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inference that she had a part in his boredom fly past and alight on more impersonal ground . She had bowed , even to this , with a smile , burning with eagerness to show her quality . The doctor had not been put to the embarrassment of explaining just what he meant by a complete change . Hester had sensed it . And so Philip Lance ! had gone away to Catalina , fishin g  --  alone . It had hurt a little , naturally . But Hester had faith in the law of compensations . There would be moments when he would miss her . Moments when he would miss her  --  she asked nothing more ! He was coming back , whole again and , even if she had no tangible part in the mystery of his recovery , she was glad site had had the courage of surrendering so completely to her duty , however filled it had been with covert disappointment .. .. It was all over now , she told herself , like the spring shower which had just passed darkly down the street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped into the shadow of the Wilmington Apartments , she was glad to come upon the figure of Mrs. Pottle , who lodged just over her , throwing open the main door . The box of strawberries was slipping from her grasp , and the leg of lamb had begun to poke its way through the indifferent wrapping . " My ! " exclaimed Mrs. Pottle , putting out a fatly jeweled hand in rescue , " you must be having a party ! " " Only my husband , " Hester explained , this time with an odd sense of sounding ridiculous . " He 's been away . " Mrs. Pottle , dangling the basket of strawberries out of range of her quite too-modish dress , glowed expansively . " Coming home , eh ? Well , ai n't that grand ! I used to say to Al , over and over again , every night at dinner , ' It does seem a shame for that lady below us to be sitting down all by herself when we 've got full and plenty . ' And Al always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her up some night ? ' . . . That 's the man of it ! When I told him we had n't been introduced he just snorted , Oh , hell , what 's the use of standing on ceremony ? Ai n't we neighbors ? ' Hester smiled wanly and pressed the button for the automatic elevator . She would have preferred to let her neighbor 's confessions of thwarted hospitality pass , but instead she said as politely as possible : " I 've been lonely , naturally . But I was n't in the mood for companionship . I 'm afraid I 'd have made a very poor guest . " Mrs. Pottle opened the elevator door and waved Hester in with fine condescension . " Blue , of course ! I know how that is ! Al goes to New York on business twice a year . And for the first week ai n't got enough pep to telephone my grandmother . But , after about ten days , I always pull myself together and think , ' What are you pining away and dying for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the veil anywhere . ' And I just go out and round up a bunch of friends and have a party . .. . I 'll say there 's nothing like company to cheer you up . " " No , I suppose not , " Hester returned helplessly . " Especially if you 've a little drop or two in the old cellar . " Mrs. Pottle gave a pleasant wink . " Now I suppose you ai n't exactly a desert yourself . " " Almost . " Hester found herself laughing back in spite of her frigid inclinations . " I 'm opening our last bottle of burgundy to-night . " " Only a quart left and wine at that ! " exclaimed Mrs. Pottle . " That ai n't any business with friend husband making a home run . . .. I 'll tell you , I 've got the grandest bottle of Gordon gin , and I 'm just going to make you a couple of cocktails . When Al comes in I 'll send him down with them ! " They had reached the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mild panic , taking her strawberries from the complacently generous Mrs. Pottle as she protested : " Oh , that 's very nice , I 'm sure . But I could n't think of robbing you ! " Her neighbor smiled back in placid triumph . " Rob us , nothing ! If you do n't get them somebody else will ! " And with that the door slammed and the elevator continued its clicking ascent to Mrs. Pottle 's floor . During the next hour Hester 's thoughts were equally divided between preparing dinner and speculating on just what means she could direct against Al Pottle 's untimely appearance with the cocktails . The Potties rather amused Hester . She was willing to take a closer view , secure in the conviction that she could keep their friendliness within bounds . But Philip , she felt sure , would have none of them . Especially would he have none of Al Pottle , resplendent in a salmon-pink tie pierced by an incredible diamond horseshoe . She remembered only too well what he had said of the Potties , following repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevator just before he had fled south , " My God ! Ca n't we escape them anywhere ? I thought there were tenements for such people ! " He had been nervously on edge then , of course , but Hester had a feeling that even a recaptured tranquillity would not tolerate the Potties . She finished crushing the strawberries for the shortcake and looked at the clock : it was six fifteen . He would be home within a half-hour . Her heart began to beat quickly , as it did in the old days at the first hint of his nearness . The thrill repaid her for all the drab , lonely weeks . She was glad she had let him go on his holiday alone . No doubt Philip would expect her to meet him and be carried off to some indifferent table d'h  --  te . How surprised he would be , first to find her missing from the throng of welcomers and again at the meal she had prepared . There was something comic in the picture she conjured up of his disappointment at finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such babies in spite of their reputed indifference to the amenities of life . The quick rush of speculations , impressions , and emotions which swept her was almost too poignant . She would never have believed that she could have recaptured youth with such completeness . Overhead a door closed sharply , succeeded by a vigorous tramping she knew only too well . Al Pottle had come in . In a few moments he would be banging on her door with his wife 's contribution to Philip 's homecoming feast . At least she hoped he would come down and get it over before Philip arrived . This was her hour , and she wished for no intrusion , much less an intrusion that she felt sure Philip would resent . . . Quite suddenly she decided to go up after the cocktails herself . Mrs. Pottle , still clad for the street , met her at the door . " Oh , " she exclaimed a bit ruefully , " I was just going to send Al down . " Hester was not even apologetic . " I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she stepped into the living room . Mrs. Pottle had been shaking the cocktails into a state of chilled perfection . The silver container , frosted with clouded moisture , lay upon a tray . Hester took in the room swiftly : satin and lace pillows , heaps of cut-glass , bronze and marble statuettes , oil paintings in heavy gold frames  --  she had known what it would be like before she had entered . " Al and I are going downtown for dinner , " Mrs. Pottle volunteered , picking up the cocktail shaker and giving it a series of rhythmical shakes . " Once in a while I go on a strike and refuse to peel another potato or broil another steak . You know how it is ! " A series of violent sneezes came from the open door leading to the bedroom . " Oh , Al , come in and say hello to Mrs. Lancet ! You know , the lady who lives downstairs ! " Al came into the room with an open handkerchief in his hand . " Glad to meet you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gave another vigorous sneeze . " Excuse me ! Guess I musta been sniffing up some dust somewhere . " " Dust ! " echoed his wife indignantly . " Not in this apartment . " She turned to Hester . " He 's catching cold but he wo n't admit it . The last time he began that way I had him in bed for three days . " Al mopped his brow and with a scornful sniff turned the subject . " You ought a let me bring them cocktails down . . Oh , no trouble at all ? a pleasure , I assure you ! Any time we 've got anything you want , why just holler to the wife . What 's neighbors for if you ca n't use ' em ? That 's what I say . " Hester escaped quickly upon the plea of her unbaked shortcake , holding the cold shaker between chilled fingers . She got back to her apartment to find the telephone ringing . Her heart was beating absurdly as she took down the receiver . " Mrs. Lancel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Plans changed . Back Sunday night . Signed Philip Lancel . . . Shall we mail copy ? " She hung up . Plans changed .. . Back Sunday night ! The brevity of it had the brutal force of a blunt weapon . She brought her apron up over her head with a quick gesture , as suddenly , without warning , she burst into tears . Her emotional outburst had the quality of an explosive touched off by final contact with a distantly lighted fuse . All the tremulous tensions of months had blazed up and flicked out with shattering violence . The succeeding calm began slowly to be rippled by little gusts of saving humor . She thought , smiling wryly , of the leg of lamb , sputtering in the oven , and the shortcake waiting its turn . She felt like the man in the parable who had spread a feast and found no willing partakers . From overhead came the sound of the Potties closing their door . She flew into the hall , signaling them to stop the elevator . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was wondering . . . " Mrs. Pottle repeated the invitation to Al . " Her husband is n't coming . Ai n't that a shame ? And she wants to know if ? " " Sure ! " Al returned heartily . A warm sense of relief mingled with a curious sense of gratitude enveloped Hester . On entering Hester 's apartment Mrs. Pottle said : " Well , this is what I call class . Kinda restful , ai n't it , Al ? You certainly have grand taste , Mrs. Lancel . " Al was more interested in the meal than the question of his hostess 's testhetic tendencies . He greeted every dish with fresh outbursts of delight . They both protested at the wine . " Not your last bottle , Mrs. Lancet ! .. . What 'll Mr. Lancet say when he gets home ? " After the shortcake Al expanded . It seemed that once he had been a saloon keeper ; now he was an automobile salesman . He wondered if the Lancels by any chance were thinking of a car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could set them up with anything from a Ford to a Rolls Royce . There were a swell lotta new models coming , with a lotta fancy trimmings and fixings , but , say , when it came to that , one of them old models was just as good on the road , and he could sneak a bargain for a friend that made it look like he was getting the car for nothing . Mrs. Pottle remonstrated . " What will Mrs. Lancel think of you , Al , talking shop at her dinner-party ! " Al rose supremely to the occasion . " Oh , Mrs. Lancel  --  she 'll understand . " And , curiously , she did . Al Pottle 's interest was friendly , quite apart from his profits . There was something fraternal about his naive assumption of intimacy . Hester was assured of his good will guaranteed for all time by the simple gesture of breaking bread at her table . She nodded reassuringly to both her guests although she was forced to say : " I 'm afraid we sha n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's taken money to run two establishments . " " Two establishments ? " queried AI , with a significant emphasis . " Not the way you mean , " his wife frowned . " You see , " explained Hester with faint amusement , " Mr. Lance ! has had a nervous breakdown . We sent him away to Catalina . He took a cottage there . " " He 's been gone three months , ai n't he ? " remarked Mrs. Pottle . " I remember the day I saw him leave . It was our wedding anniversary . remember what I said to Al , ' That man downstairs must be going off on a long trip from the look of his baggage . He must be a traveling salesman ! ' " What made you think that ? " " Well , I certainly did n't think a woman would be letting her husband go away alone on a pleasure trip . " She threw a warmly tolerant glance at Al . " Men get into enough mischief when they go off on business . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cure , " replied Hester with a note of pride . " The doctor recommended a complete change . You see , my presence did n't come under that head . " " Of course the doctor was a man ! " sniffed Mrs. Pottle with bland good humor . " Men always hang together . " " Ah , come on ! " protested Al . " I do n't call it very polite making phony cracks about a lady 's husband . After all , when a man 's sick he ai n't apt to be flighty . " " Ai n't he ! Well , Al Pottle , I 'd hate to turn you loose alone on one of them beaches down south sick or well . Not with all the movie queens lying around in one-piece bathing suits . " " Oh , well , " put in Hester with a superior air , " if my husband comes home well that 's all that matters . " " That 's what you say now ! " cried Mrs. Pottle with a laugh . " But anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Sure , do n't I know ? " grunted Al . " The old lady ai n't never as happy as when she 's got me in bed with a hot-water bottle at my feet . " " I know where you are then ! " Mrs. Pottle threw back . Everybody laughed , and Al Pottle had a violent attack of sneezing , upon which his wife turned a look of triumphant prophecy . In the moment of silence which followed Hester found herself thinking of Philip with a touch of resentment . Plans changed  --  back Sunday night ! Certainly her forethought had earned more consideration than that ! At this point a misgiving submerged her displeasure . Could it be possible that Philip had mistaken her self-effacement for indifference ? Did he fancy that his departure or return could have only casual significance ? But she realized how absurd that was ! She understood perfectly . Doubtless the fishing was so exciting that it had beguiled him into stealing just one more day . Men were such children , after all ! Mrs. Pottle was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially the inspiring blue of her Canton china . " Mine 's Haviland  --  pink roses and gold . You 'll see when you have dinner with us . " " Oh , yes . . . Yes , of course , " Hester found herself murmuring , with fleeting trepidation at Mrs. Pottle 's assumption of sustained friendship . A silence fell again , and presently Al , stretching himself , said amiably : " What do you say to a run downtown ? We could drop in somewhere and dance ! " " With that cold of yours coming on ? " said Mrs. Pottle . " Sure , it will do it good ! " Mrs. Pottle shrugged . " They 're all alike ! " she said to Hester with a shrug of resignation . " Well , what 's the verdict ? " asked Al . " Are you game ? " Hester was expecting Mrs. Pottle to voice another protest so she said nothing . " Sure we 're game ! " cried Mrs. Pottle suddenly rising from her seat . Hester felt routed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it matter , anyway ? Outside the night was glamorous and gay . They decided to walk , and Powell Street lay before them , a gilded cascade of light leaping like some fabulous and enchanted stream into the molten torrent of Market Street . The steep hill , falling away from Bush Street , made the women ding , pattering , to Al 's arm . A man , climbing up , turned and looked after them , diverted no doubt by the spectacle of a single male supporting two such divergent types  --  Mrs. Pottle , flamboyant and bovine , Hester , gray-eyed and immaculate to a point of severity , her figure slender , if not precisely virginal , her brown hair straying out in little rebellious wisps to meet the evening breeze . Al proposed the St. Francis . Hester 's first impulse was snobbish . She could n't help speculating whether anyone she knew would be there . She could n't quite fancy presenting the Pottles to any of her intimates . But her sense of fairness intervened . She had no business to be ashamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel steward . He shook his hand , nudged him in the ribs , whispered an indecent fragment . The result was a perfectly placed table close to the edge of the dancing space . They sat down with the least possible formality , and Mrs. Pottle took out her vanity case and powdered her nose . Their entrance had been achieved with a more or less vulgar flourish . Hester felt annoyed  --  sorry , in fact , that she had been beguiled into deserting her solitude ; but presently the orchestra began to whinny , and its cadence got into her blood . Without realizing it , her shoulders rose and fell rhythmically . Mrs. Pottle began genially to chide her husband . " What 's the matter with you , Al ? " she scolded . " Why do n't you get up and dance with Mrs. Lancel ? " Al made a reluctant move toward rising . Hester checked him . " No , please ! ... It 's much more fun to sit and watch ! " The music began more and more to communicate its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undulating stream of dancers . A wistful melancholy fell gently upon Hester Lance ' , evoked by a minor strain in the placid flow of melody . The leader himself was performing now , blowing out a thin trickle of sound  --  the silver pipings of a twentieth-century Pan  --  which rose magically above the sensuous shuffle of bewitched feet . Hester found her thoughts slipping back to the days when she had been beguiled by the sense of Philip Lancel 's nearness enwrapped in a flood of provocative sound . Dancing then had been gayer , more obvious and full-blooded  --  less a thing of subtle modulations and crashing climaxes . Now the saxophone was moaning , working up the entire orchestra to a fanatical frenzy . Would the dance end in the swirling laughter of brass or die out in a vague , cool whisper ? . .. The sound fell again to the tranquil dribblings of the pipes . Ilex groves and splashing fountains and leaping fauns rose up to meet Hester 's mood . Faintly the murmuring melody receded , grew dim , and sighing , spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath , slowly released , escaped Hester . The encore began , sprightly and charged with overtones . Mrs. Pottle 's feet began to tap the floor and suddenly she said to Al : " Well , ai n't you going to ask friend wife for the pleasure ? " Al flashed a look of mock misery at Hester and rose . They dashed off , pumping their shoulders energetically . The music had grown strident and forthright . This time it seemed there were to be no inflections or repressions . Without varying the tempo , the quality of the dance was changed completely . What had before been dreamy and almost delicate was now a thing of gayety and joy . Everybody was smiling . Hester decided to change her seat . She wanted a better view of the dancing floor . The waiter came , bringing the pallid drinks of prohibition  --  grenadine punches for the ladies and a horse's-neck for Al Pottle . She selected a straw and bent slightly forward as she sipped pensively at the sickly-sweet draught . The music no longer held her captive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the personality of the dancers . Her first impression was a composite picture of sophisticated youth . The girls were very slender , and the boys lean of flank and towering There were few couples past thirty on the floor , Time was when such a gathering had been full of personalities known to her  --  people she could at least place . But to-night she recognized no one . Was the city growing larger , more impersonal ? . . . She transferred her glance from the dancing-floor to the tables in the hope of finding a familiar face . She wondered faintly whether , when Philip returned , she could beguile him into an occasional dip into this discreet bohemia ? He had n't liked the quality of these diversions lately . Well , he was like so many men , she supposed , growing more phlegmatic with the years , more content with his own fireside , moreand more a one-woman man . She was glad , of course . If Philip had n't been just this sort of man she would n't have had the courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't have borne to have had him like Al Pottle , ogling over his wife 's shoulder at every responsive flapper who floated by him . Her hope for a greater gayety when Philip got home was not framed so much for her need as his . She did n't want him to get bored again . Her thoughts became transferred to an arresting flame of head-gear lighting up a discreet corner . The startling red of it flashed between the dancing forms like the fitful gleam of a danger signal . She bent forward , curious to discover the personality back of such a positive and emphatic bit of millinery . But the woman 's back was toward her . She could see only the bared arms and the patch of skin below the nape of the neck , tanned to a gypsy brown . The slender arms proclaimed their owner 's youth , and the sunburnt skin suggested hours upon a strand of southern beach . . . . Would Philip be tanned ? Hester found herself wondering . Naturally . He adored swimming and besides ? At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a swift , terrifying glance at the man sitting opposite it . . . . Only when the music stopped and the voice of Mrs. Pottle had broken in on her with , " I guess we 'd better go home , Mrs. Lancel ! " did Hester realize that she had been staring at the face of her husband . She closed the door upon the retreating Pottles and threw her hat into a corner as she sank into the first chair . Why did n't she scream or claw the tapestry on the arms of her chair or smash a vase ? That 's what Mrs. Pottle would have done . Why did she sit , dry-eyed , stupidly opening and closing the palms of her hands ? . If my husband comes home well that 's all that matters . He had come home well , all right . It had taken only one glimpse of his sunburnt face to tell her that . His companion had been young and pretty , too . Young and pretty ! Well , why not ? Was she expected to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband go through the comedy of arrival ? Just what was the proper etiquette for a self-effacing wife to use on such an occasion ? She wondered if he had seen her . Go down and meet him ? Well , just watch her ! She 'd pack her things that very night and let him have his recaptured health and his woman all to himself . She was n't in the habit of making compromises . She 'd show him . She went into the bedroom and opened the closet door , rummaging through its shallow depths for her week-end bag . But after she had thrown it upon the bed , her hands trembled so that she could n't assemble the articles to go in it . Overhead she heard the heavy tramping of Mrs. Pottle . Al was sneezing again , and the reverberations echoed down the light-well on which his bathroom opened . She had a comic picture of Mrs. Pottle filling up the hot-water bottle and badgering Al into the captivity of bed to-morrow . She remembered the confusion of the kitchen and she suddenly left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She lighted the water heater and began to scrape the soiled plates and pile them on the drain-board of the sink with neat precision . Her hands grew steady under the discipline of this routine . She threw out the remnants of the shortcake and the mashed potatoes . Philip never liked potatoes done over . But she saved the peas for a salad and the cold roast lamb . They could have cold roast lamb to-morrow . Cold roast lamb , to-morrow . . . . Cold roast lamb ! She felt trapped and began to laugh . She went back into the bedroom and , taking the suitcase from the bed , flung it into the closet again . Al Pottle had ceased his sneezing . He was coughing now , in hard , tight gasps that were significant . Without doubt he was going to be laid up , and Mrs. Pottle would have her transient moment of security . . . Well , she supposed that even Philip Lancel would have a cold occasionally .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
