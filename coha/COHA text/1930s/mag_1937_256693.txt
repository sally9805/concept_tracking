LITTLE CHILDREN - William Saroyan - Harcourt , Brace ( $2.50 ) . <P> William Saroyan is 29 . When he was 26 , a book of brash short stories ( The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze ) won him the reputation of most terrible literary infant of the year . Since then William Saroyan has been increasingly a problem child . Critics and readers alike have been impressed by his audacity , displeased by his bounding ego . His coldest dispraisers admit that he sometimes blurts out a suggestive truth ; his warmest admirers wish occasionally that he would not shout so loud . Last week Saroyan 's fourth book , Little Children , well illustrated his inclusive vices and his eclectic virtues . Of the 17 stories printed , perhaps half were worth it ; five certainly did him credit , lent weight to the belief that the boy was growing older . <P> Some of them : <P> An urchin writes a love letter to the richest little girl in his class , who haughtily hands it in to teacher , who sends the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the urchin 's eyes . <P> A boy 's first day in school brings tears to the eyes of his foster mother , but gives him a rich feeling of man-about-town . <P> A little boy is saving his nickels to buy a $1 zeppelin so that he and his pal can go to the Klondike in it . When the zeppelin arrives , they are disappointed that it turns out to be a toy .
