At the New York World 's Fair , as a part of a Merrie England folderol , the Bard of Avon is played inside a replica of the famed Elizabethan Globe Theatre . Thanks to Director Margaret Webster , the Old Globe 's Shakespeare is neither skittish nor stodgy . Four Shakespeare comedies-As You Like It , A Midsummer Night 's Dream , The Comedy of Errors , The Taming of the Shrew-have been shrunk to a quarter their usual size , ironed without starch . Punched into shape as unceremoniously as a vaudeville act , Shakespeare 's one-acters-runoff seven times a day-perk up . <P> Only one falls flat . That nobody can do anything with the puerile plot of The Comedy of Errors was shown this season when Rodgers &; Hart found it the snag in their otherwise delightful The Boys from Syracuse . But the Old Globe 's The Taming of the Shrew picks up enormously by having Kate take the count within 45 minutes , becomes , indeed , an exuberant comic-strip courtship . Best of the four productions is A Midsummer Night 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all but missing its marvelous moon-drenched poetry . But largely missing too are Hermia and Helena and their supporting cast of bores . What remains are the comic ad-ventures of Bottom and his fellow bumpkins , culminating in the uproarious production of Pyramus &; Thisbe before the Duke . To many in the first-night audience , Shakespeare seemed almost as good as Billy Rose 's Aquacade . <P> For Margaret Webster , newsreel-length Shakespeare was a light chore at the end of a heavy season . Besides laboring at the Maurice Evans Hamlet and Henry IV Part I , she directed the current Family Portrait , plays Mary Magdalene in it . The most powerful new director in the U. S. theatre , Margaret Webster is bold , witty , imaginative . She does not approach Shakespeare on bended knee , but gives him a hearty slap on the back . <P> Blue-eyed , reddish-haired Director Webster was born- " a small tangerine-colored object " - 34 years ago in Manhattan . On both sides she comes of English actors : famed Dame May Whitty is her mother , Shakespearean Actor Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slid into directing because the field was less crowded , but admits she prefers acting . Though she professionally directed a score of plays in England , it was in the U. S. three years ago , with Evans ' Richard II , that she first directed Shakespeare . Directing plans for next year : Chekhov 's The Cherry Orchard . Some day : Shakespeare 's Troilus and , Cressida , Macbeth . <P> Margaret Webster finds Broadway much more exciting than London , though she protests that Broadway still reveals " an awful hangover from what the Shuberts did in 1910 . " Her favorite U. S. directors are Guthrie McClintic ( Mamba 's Daughters ) , Herman Shumlin ( The Little Foxes ) , but she . has no desire to be , as they are , a producer as well . Acting , directing , adapting plays , writing a book about her family keep her pleasantly occupied .
