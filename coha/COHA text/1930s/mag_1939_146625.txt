What was probably the longest sport-train excursion yet staged in the U. S. took place last week when the B. &; O. R. R. , encouraged by the success of ski and bicycle trains , inaugurated a fishing special from Chicago to Annapolis , Md. ( 850 mi. ) for a week-end of saltwater angling in Chesapeake Bay . Of the 52 Midwest lake-fishermen ( 48 men and four wives ) who made the trip , 40 had never even seen salt water . Returning home with 700 fish , mostly hardheads and croakers , the first batch of angling excursionists felt quite satisfied that they had $40 worth of fun .
