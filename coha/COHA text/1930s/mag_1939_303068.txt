Every day in the year , the American Medical Association keeps a watchful eye on every hospital in the U. S. Last week the Journal of the A. M. A. published its annual hospital report , which contains " the most accurate figures available . " <P> Significant facts : <P> &gt; There are now 6,166 registered hospitals in the U. S. , as compared to 6,128 a year ago . These hospitals hold more than one million beds . Over 70% of the total in crease in beds was due to expansion of public hospitals , which now total 1,728 . <P> State hospitals which accommodate mostly insanity , cancer and tuberculosis patients accounted for most of this increase . <P> &gt; " Most striking of all changes " was the increase in nervous and mental hospitals , which averaged only 350,000 patients a day in 1927 , but over 550,000 last year . <P> &gt; Every 3.3 seconds , a patient enters a U. S. hospital . During 1938 one person in 14 became a hospital patient . If he went to a general hospital he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hospitalization " is clipped shorter and shorter . " <P> &gt; In 1938 , " for the first time in history , " over one million U. S. babies ( out of two million ) were born in hospitals . <P> &gt; Greatest scarcity of hospitals is in Mississippi ( 1.4 beds to each thousand inhabitants ) . Greatest abundance is in the District of Columbia ( 8.6 beds per thousand ) . Most States average from two to four beds per thousand inhabitants . <P> &gt; There are about 6,100 internships available every year . Since graduates of U. S. medical schools totaled less than 5,200 last year , there are " approximately 900 positions that can not be filled from our own medical schools . . . . Currently a relative shortage of interns exists . " This shortage , said the Journal , may be remedied if hospitals induce interns to remain two years instead of one , and accept well-trained graduates of foreign medical schools who pass tests given by the National Board of Medical Examiners ( see p. 4 ) .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
