As manager of the consolidated airline ticket office in Toledo , J. Dunham Ruhl wearied of thumbing through timetables . Especially he wearied of hunting down connection times among schedules of the 26 U. S. airlines , even in a single 50-page booklet containing all of them . Last fortnight he published a handy timefinder-a 4-ft. map of the U. S. showing not only every airline , but every plane schedule , with times of arrival &; departure at each city . Around the border , as paid advertising , are the tariff schedules of the lines . The map is to be published monthly by Standard Airway Schedule Co. , which consists of J. Dunham Ruhl &; wife .
