txt Short-Sightedness . General Johnson 's " crack down " on the banks of the nation for their all-. too-eager acceptance of a schedule of charges to be made against those who with the instinct of thrift and security try to maintain a bank account is to be commended . It is just another instance of shortsightedness in a major industry in putting on more than the traffic will stand . The railroads did that , until they lost business almost to a complete vanishing point . Now the frantic campaign is under way to win it back . The line of men and women at the postoffice money order windows has lengthened even since the small charge was made by the banks for handling small accounts . The way is open for the postoffice to take care of even more of these men and women who must have some method of transferring money in the conduct of their small businesses . Perhaps the government will find the ' way to do it by an amplified money-order system . S. L. K. Philadelphia , Pa. , Dec. 30. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
