txt Opposed to Coercion To the Editor Of The New York Times : What is sauce for the goose is surely sauce for the broiled lobster . Your issue of Oct. 26 quotes Glenn McCabe , president of the Federation of Flat Glass Workers , as calling the strike because the union 's demand for a closed shop was refused . Even though it were now legal , how would Mr. McCabe et al like to have the company lock them out unless they left the union ? ' The tyranny of ignorance - is worse than that of any other type . The American people are long-suffering ; they bend so far , but never break . They will eventually rise up against the coercion of our citizens by the oligarchy of labor . The mass of our people work for some one and sympathize with their class , but they do not sympathize with coercion and tyranny . They have too strong an individualistic formation to permit any one to tell them that they can not exert their constitutional right to work without joining a union . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 , 1936.
