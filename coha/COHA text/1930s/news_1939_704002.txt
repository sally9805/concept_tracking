txt Two things unprecedented in the history of British royal activities marked the first day 's visit of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth to Ottawa , the Capital of the Dominion of Canada . The King has given the royal assent to bills passed at a session of the Dominion Parliament and a reception has been held for members of the press . Following a drive through the City 's beautiful avenues and parkways upon their arrival , when they were greeted as joyously and vociferously as they had been at Montreal , and following a private luncheon at Government House with the Governor General , Lord Tweedsmuir , and Lady Tweedsmuir Their Majesties attended the day 's session in the Red Chamber of the Senate . Doubtless one of the most color- ful events of their entire tour , it resembled in its ceremonial formality and beauty the opening of Parliament in London . The groaned arches of Canadian sandstone and the white and green marble flooring of the foyer set off in rich relief the brilliant uniforms of the Guard of Honor as they took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the scarlet coats of the Princess Louise Dragoons , the braided uniform of a Rear Admiral , the plaid and busby of a colonel of the Canadian Black Watch , Red Coats and Plumed hats of Field Officers , cockades and gleaming swords and rows of medals ? Vc and DSO and MC ? were a tapestry of moivng color worthy the shuttle of the Lady of Shalott . The King in his picturesque uniform of Field Marshal , the Queen a fairy story figure in lustrous white taffetas enriched with pale gold , her small head encncled with a diamond coronet ; the Prime Minister , W. L. Mackenzie King . resplendent in the black and gold uniform of an Imperial Privy Councillor , and the Supreme Court Judges in their n obes of scarlet sitting on the woolsack , made an interesting contrast to the rear half of the chamber and its 800 visitors . The wives of members and their friends wore evening gowns , mostly of pastel blues and mauves , in courtesy to the Queen , who has expressed a preference for such hues in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small group in solemn procession , among them the sergeant-at-arms , carrying the gold mace , and the gentleman of the Black Rod , filed slowly through the long corridors to knock on the door of Commons , whose members thereupon followed them back to the Red Chamber and stood behind the brass rail at the rear of the room , for they are not permitted inside . " May it please your Majesty , the Senate and House of Commons have passed the following bills to which they humbly iequest your Majesty 's assent . " Eight of the bills tied up with red ribbon and indicated by the clerk of the Crown in Chancety were approved by an inclination of the royal head , and the Clerk of the Senate announced , " His Majesty doth assent to these bills . " Lady Tweedsmuir , who usually occupies the throne with Lord Tweedsmuir , looked down from the gallery while the Governor General was not to be seen . Since he is his Majesty 's personal representative there is no need for him to officiate when the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing again through the Gothic hall beneath the Peace Tower the men in formal afternoon attire and the women in evening frocks and all the glittering officeis in full dress uniform burst suddenly into an explosion of cheering which echoed and re-echoed through the vaulted ceiling and up into the belfrey from which a carillon of welcome had pealed out but four hours previously . When at the command of Their Majesties the Governor General invited the 70-odd mcmbeis of the pilot train , pi css corps , and other journalists to a reception at Government House , after the approving of bills in the Houses of Parliament , the majority of them were out on roofs of high buildings or peiched with cameramen in well-nigh inaccessible corners of towers or sealed temporarily in some reserved observation gallery , but somehow they managed to break their way through the milling crowds and the innumerable guard lines of police , veterans , and militia , pick up their white gloves and their silk top hats and , by the skin of their teeth , catch the bus which was to take them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for they walked around the reception hall to each person presented to them , and chatted with several about their work , the place from which they came , the extent to which certain publications broadcast , and so forth . Today 's program is one of striking contrast : the trooping of the colors on Parliament Hill by the brigade of Canadian Guards , a ceremony of guard mounting dating from the Eighteenth Century when the battalion forming the guards for the day trooped the color which was to be carried on the King 's guard . Four guards , each of about three officers and 50 other ranks , are furnished from each battalion of the brigade of Canadian Guards and formed up at Parliament Hill , together with massed bands and drums . The total number of troops on parade , all in full dress uniform , approxi ' mates 600 . The King 's color is posted about the center of the parade , and on his arrival the King is received with a royal salute . Elaborate Menu The festival note is struck by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Governor General and Lady Tweedsmuir . It will be similar to the customary party which is held on the King 's birthday . Three huge cakes weighing 200 pounds each , over 13,000 sandwiches , 3,600 sausage rolls , 6,000 eclairs , and 600 bricks of ice cream are a few of the items on the menu . George is the Ottawa artist who designed the cakes . They are sur , mounted with a replica of the royal crown , and from the base of each one arises a frosting battleship representing the Collingwood on which His Majesty served at the battle of Jutland . The rose , thistle , and shamrock emerge above this and nine maple leaves and the coat of arms of Great Britain complete the list of motifs . This evening the King and Queen will honor the Government of Canada by attending a Parliamentary dinner . Tomorrow they will participate in the ceremony of unveiling the national war memorial and will leave on the royal train about 2:15 in the afternoon , stopping for a drive through Kingston and arriving in Toronto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
