txt In a conciliatory speech whose courage was widely praised Foreign Minister Julius Curtius of Germany today did much to remove the bad effects on the French of his League of Nations Assembly address Saturday and thus improve the atmosphere for the approaching visit to Berlin of Premier Laval and Foreign Minister Briand . The conciliatory tone was so strong , so easy to misrepresent and so liable to anger the Nationalists and other Germans who already have been attacking him that a good many think Dr. Curtius has taken his political life in his hands . The gesture was made at the annual luncheon given to the President of the Assembly and the President and members of the Council by the International Association of Journalists Acredited to the League . Viscount Cecil of Chelwood , in a toast , gave by the anecdote method a gentle and unmistakable hint that he thought the Germans might adopt a little friendlier tone toward the French than Dr. Curtius did Saturday ' and that the world was getting tired of the continual Franco-German dispute .

Briand Jokes With Curtius . A cartoon by the Hungarian caricaturists , Derso and Kelen , on the menu provided the means . It showed M. Briand as founder of the European union commission , alone on the edge of a precipice , pointing with a cigarette to the Promised Land . A little behind him came a procession of all ' the Foreign Ministers of Europe , with Dr. Curtius in the van throwing up his hands . Alluding wittily to all this , M. Briand made clear his isolation and jokingly suggested that his friend Dr. Curtius 's gesture seemed to show he was alarmed at the goal toward which they were headed and the nearness of the precipice . Dr. Curtius , in the most eloquent speech the writers have heard him make , then took the cartoon for his text , too . Stressing the fact that all the European Foreign Ministers were shown moving in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " We all are determined to follow M. Briand as our leader to the promised land . " While many in the audience gaped at the German Foreign Minister admitting the French Foreign Minister as his leader , Dr. Curtius thus interpreted his gesture in the cartoon : " My arms are outthrown not in alarm but in enthusiasm for the goal toward which M. Briand is leading us . Only boldness can win success . " Dr. Curtius concluded : " By close cooperation we can find a way out of this crisis . That is especially true as far as Europe is concerned and what is necessary is close FrancoGerman collaboration . Firmly Decided on Collaboration . ? " We are firmly decided to pursue such collaboration between our two countries . It is only in this way and with the aid of the League that we can hope to master the difficulties and reach the goal set by M. Briand in his moving and impressive words ? the complete suppression of war .

The importance the French attach to these points indicates the line of policy they are pursuing . Finland 's desire to have the Council examine her claims against Great Britain for some ships lost in the World War came before the Council . The discussion was chiefly remarkable for the degree to which the greater power opposed recourse not only to the Council but to all international machinery for settling the dispute as the smaller power proposed .

Opposes Asking Advisory Opinion . He also opposed the Finnish proposal that the World Court 's advisory opinion be asked as to whether the Council was really incompetent to decide the question , as Britain maintained . Britain holds that the resources of British law have not yet been exhausted and wants the case left to them . There was no decision today . With forty-eight voting , the Assembly today elected three non-permanent members of the Council , China unanimously , Panama with 45 votes and Spain , re-elected , with 43 . Mexico , Hungary and Portugal each got 2 and Belgium and Bulgaria each 1 . The expectation of Mexico 's being elected ended when Guatemala withdrew her resigRation from the Council and thus reduced the seats to be filled ' from four to three .
