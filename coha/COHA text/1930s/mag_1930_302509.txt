Wagner 's Gtterdmmerung begins with three Norns darkly spinning the fates which are to enmesh the erring gods . Light breaks when their prophecy is told . The swaggering Siegfried enters and after him Brnnhilde in the full ecstasy of love . This moment , important in any performance of Gtterdmmerung , was doubly significant last week at Manhattan 's Metropolitan Opera House for Brnnhilde was Soprano Elisabeth Ohms making her U. S. dbut . <P> In Europe Elisabeth Ohms is regarded as one of the foremost singers of the day . A native of Arnhem , Holland , she began to study singing at 16 , was graduated from the Amsterdam Conservatory at 19 , soon afterward appeared in concerts under Conductor Willem Mengelberg . Her operatic career was chiefly molded in Germany-in Mainz where she sang for two years , in Munich where tourists have flocked to hear her Isolde , her Leonore ( Fidelio ) , her Elektra , her Tosca , her Brnnhildes in the Ring operas . Famed too have been her appearances at London 's Covent Garden , at La Scala in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there for a stay of five years . Europeans predicted for her a great U. S. career . She is young , comely , heroically built . She has two qualities rare in opera singers : taste ( although her effective costumes are to be credited to her husband , Russian Leo Pasetti , designer of scenery and costumes for the Munich opera ) and intelligence ( she speaks many languages fluently ) . But Manhattan last week was unwilling to give her unqualified approval on a single hearing . Critics confessed themselves swayed by her fine flair for the stage , conceded that the Gtterdmmerung Brnnhilde is the most taxing role in all grand opera . But her voice they found to spread unpleasantly , to be piercing in the upper register . Its colors were not deep enough , some said , to suggest a woman given to great love , revenge , final understanding .
