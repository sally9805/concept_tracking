txt Mr. Rogers Reports the Horse Is Doing a Real Come-Back To the Editor of The New York Times : SANTA MONICA , Cal. , April 3 . ? Major Chamberlin and his troop of crack riders of our army were just up here at the ranch . They are our representatives in the Olympics . They are at San Diego working day and night on their horses . Major Chamberlin has represented us in previous games and he says that the horsemanship events are the most popular on the whole program . You talk about something coming back . Say , the old horse is coming back in a high lope . Thousands of people are riding a horse today that five years ago could n't sit in a Ford with all doors locked . Polo and horse shows are all doing great work to help the farmer and rancher to raise better horses . We oughtto legalize racing in every State . Sure , people will bet , but they get to see the horses run , and you certainly ca n't see General Motors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Yours , WILL ROGERS .
