txt The Board of Tax Appeals fixed 5:103,053 plus interest yesterday as the amount , of 1931 income taxes msed by the late Andrew W. Mellon for 1931 . This concluded , as far as the , Boatel was concerned , a sensational dispute of many years in which the Internal Revenue Bureau tried to collect , more than $3,000,000 flout Mr. Mellon and to prove he was guilty , of income tax fraud The Board ; ruled a few months ago that Mr. Mellon was innocent of the fraud ' charge and laid down legal principles which wiped out most of the Government claim . The exact amount , however , was left to be determined by attorneys for both sides on the basis of the Board 's legal ruling Both sides have been considering appealing the decision to the Circuit Court of Appeals , but neither has announced what it will do Interest charges , attorneys said , would amount to about 30 per cent , increasing the total to more than $500,000              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
