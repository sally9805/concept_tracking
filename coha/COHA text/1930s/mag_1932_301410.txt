When the U. S. Academies at West Point and Annapolis agreed last summer , after a three-year breach of athletic relations , to resume playing football with each other , they failed to settle the differences on which the breach was based . Navy like other colleges observes the three-year eligibility rule ; at West Point cadets who have played three years of varsity football elsewhere are still eligible for the team . This gives West Point an obvious advantage in Army-Navy games . Navy has not won since 1921 . In last week 's game , closing the football season for the East , stout-hearted Navy tried hard , but anyone could see that Army had more power , more experience . Its team was precisely as much better than Navy 's as the score , 20-to-0 , showed . <P> Army 's first touchdown came in the second quarter . After a 54-yd. march down Franklin Field , Quarterback Pick Vidal plunged through centre across the goal line . Navy played tenacious football and had bad luck with penalties and passes in the second half . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack Buckler threw a 34-yd. pass to Bill Frenzel , who caught it on Navy 's 6-yd. line , fell into the end zone as he was tackled . Five minutes before the game ended , Buckler did most of the work on a 40-yd. march in twelve plays and went around his right end for the last touchdown . <P> One of Army 's points in the discussion of eligibility rules has always been that many of its best football players would be eligible anywhere . Jack Buckler , a yearling from Waco , substitute this season for Ken Fields , is a case in point . So is rapid little Quarterback Vidal . Brother of a famed Army end , Gene Vidal , who was on the team in 1916-17 , he finished school at 15 , waited a year , entered Wrest Point when he was still under age . This season , his first as a member of the first-string team , he was Army 's best broken field runner . He will be graduated next spring at 20 . <P> Auburn , ready to clinch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a comfortable lead of two touchdowns in the first half . South Carolina made a 60-yd. march to a touchdown in the third quarter but it did not seem important ; Auburn scored again soon after the kickoff . Then , in the last quarter , after a weak Auburn punt , South Carolina completed two passes for a touchdown ; an Auburn fumble opened the way for another . South Carolina 's Quarterback Hal Mauney kicked the goal that ended the game 20-to-20. first time Auburn has been tied this year . Tennessee , by beating feeble Florida 32-to-13 , and Louisiana State ended the season in a triple tie with Auburn for the championship . In a poll of 31 sportswriters on southern newspapers , 22 favored giving the title to Tennessee for winning seven conference games to Auburn 's six , with one tie each . <P> Alabama 's Captain John ( " Hurry " ) Cain cut through St. Mary 's right tackle on his own 29-yd. line , swerved toward the left side of the field , wriggled away from three tacklers and sidestepped two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more minutes of bruising , grunting , thumping , kicking and pounding , the score still remained Alabama 6 , St. Mary 's 0 , at San Francisco . <P> Nebraska , Big Six champion , ended its season with a trip to Dallas and a beating , 21-to-14 , for Southern Methodist .
