The U. S. Military Academy at West Point last week let out 64 cadets deficient in studies . At the station , Major General William Ruthven Smith , superintendent of the Academy , bade them goodbye , wished them success . All were still in uniform as they passed through Manhattan on their way home , but newsgatherers had no trouble in singling out the one they were looking for ; a tall , broad-shouldered boy of 20 whose face was darker than the dark brown-paper bundle under his arm . He was Alonzo Souleigh Parham , the fourteenth Negro to enter West Point , the eleventh to leave before graduation . <P> Tactless newsgatherers stabbed with questions . Cadet Parham , more tactful than they , replied : " I got a square deal . I was given very good treatment . The officers were my friends and cadets , too , both from the North and South . " Had he been happy ? " Well , take any young fellow away from home out where men are men . He 's going to be lonesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would he make a racial issue of his failure ? " I should say not ! " <P> <P> If he had been at all displeased with his treatment at the Point , the only clue he gave was that , honorably discharged , he was " not particularly disappointed . " <P> Cadet Parham , appointed from Chicago by Negro Congressman Oscar De Priest , entered the Academy last summer ( TIME , July 15 ) . Almost at once he fell behind his class in mathematics ( algebra and geometry ) . Once when he was about to resign Congressman De Priest came to see him , urged him to " stick it out . " He started special coaching , stopped after a week . His grades in mathematics were so consistently low that his classmates suspected he was " boning foundation " ( inviting discharge by failing to work ) . They felt that , though there was no hazing , no discrimination , he would not have entered the Academy if he had foreseen his position as West Point 's lone Negro . They " handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any but exemplary conduct . Also satisfied that there had been no discrimination was Congressman De Priest . Promising to name another Negro , he asked : " If I do n't appoint men of my own race to the Academy , who will ? I do not propose to be disloyal. . . . "
