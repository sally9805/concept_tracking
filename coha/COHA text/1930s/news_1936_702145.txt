txt Characterizing the Roosevelt Social Security Act as " unjust , unworkable , stupidly drafted and wastefully financed , " Governor Landon tonight pledged himself and the Republican party to amend it to provide old-age pensions for needy American citizens more than 65 years old financed on a commonsense , pay-as-you-go basis and large enough to give each such person a minimum income sufficient to protect him or her from want . Disclosing his position on unemployment insurance , - the Republican Presidential candidate , who spoke at the Milwaukee auditorium , advised caution and delay in Federal legislation . He advocated encouragement of legislation by the States to meet this problem and declared that by State exp9rimentation with different plans a much better result could be worked out than could possibly be achieved at this time in Washington . " Day dreams do not pay pensions , " Governor Landon declared , and to the elderly , unemployed and infirm he added : " I will not promise the moon . I promise only what I know can be performed  --  economy , a living pension and such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 7,000 Assemble Despite Rain Despite the rainy night , about 7,000 persons filled the Auditorium to capacity . Governor Landon was introduced by Alexander Wiley , Republican candidate for Governor . " This man is one of us , " Mr. Wiley said . " He has made a success of his own business . He has made a success of the business of a great State . He is a man in whose hands the nation 's affairs will be safe , and the vote in Wisconsin next November will prove that we support our convictions with our ballots . " Governor Landon received an even more enthusiastic ovation than at Des Moines and Minneapolis . Pleased by the demonstration , he smiled and waved his hand at the audience for several minutes . The audience frequently interrupted the speech with applause and applauded at the end . As he concluded the address Governor Landon waved to the audience and then shook hands with those on the stage . Law Called " Cruel Hoax " He asserted that the Roosevelt method of financing old-age pensions by a payroll tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wagner-Lewis Social Security Act , was a " cruel hoax " on the workers . He said that the creation of a " needless " reserve of $47,000 , - 000,000 would result in that additional amount of bonds in the Federal treasury and encouragement of further Federal extravagance . He declared that when the aged sought payment of their pensions they would find in the government strong box only bundles of " I. 0 . U 's . " Governor Landon said he could not state with finality the total cost of his old-age-pension plan . One of the most serious criticisms of the present Social Security Act , he asserted , was the haste with which it was constructed , and he added I that he did not intend to repeat that error . He said he had been studying the problem for a year and a half and that , while he was not willing to accept elaborate computations which have have been made for him as final , it was clear that the cost of his plan would be much less than that of the Roosevelt administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay-asyou go basis , with the result that we will know year by year what our pensions are costing us , " he declared . " This is sound , commonsense financing . " Advocates " Visible " Tax To raise the money to pay the old-age pensions , he advocated a direct , visible special tax , earmarked for this purpose and widely distributed . " Only if every member of our great body of citizens is conscious ! of his share of the cost can we hope to resist the constant pressure to increase pensions to the point where the burden will be unbearable , " he said . " Only if every one bears his just share can we hope to prevent the plan being used for political purposes . " If we will prevent such exploitation and if we will put the plan on a sound financial basis , we can afford to be liberal with our old people . If the present compulsory insurance plan remains in force , our old people are only too apt to find the cupboard bare . " I am a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My criticism of the present act is not that its purpose is bad . It is that the act will involve a cruel disappointment for those of our people least able to bear the shock of disappointment . " He devoted three-quarters of his speech to criticism of the present Social Security Act , which he condemned in accepting the nomination for President . He said that there were two ways to approach the development of a program of economic security , one to assume that human beings are improvident and that stern management by a paternal government is necessary to force them to provide for themselves and save for their old age , and the other to recognize that in an industrial nation some persons are unable to provide for their old age and that it is the responsibility of society to take care of them . Social Justice Held Hey " The act passed by the present administration is based upon the first of these approaches , " the Governor continued . " It assumes that Americans are irresponsible . It assumes that old-age pensions are necessary because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I refuse to accept any such judgment of my fellow-citizens . " I believe that as a nation we can afford old-age pensions , that in a highly industralized country they are necessary . I believe in them as a matter of social justice . " He called the Social Security Act a glaring example of the bungling and waste which , he said , had characterized the Roosevelt administration 's program . The act , he pointed out , is divided into three main sections . One section , he added , deals with compulsory oldage insurance and applies to about one-half the working population. , excluding farmers , farm laborers and domestic servants . Another section , he declared , attempts to force the States to adopt unemployment insurance systems , and the third section provides for old-age pensions for those who do not come under the compulsory plan . Under the compulsory plan , he asserted , none of the old people would get a pension until 1942 and those so insured would have to earn on the average $125 a month for the next twenty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month for the next forty-five years to get a monthly pension of $59.38 . " Largest Tax Bill in History " On Jan. 1 , next , he continued , employers must begin to deduct taxes from the pay envelopes of their employes and turn them over to the government to start this insurance fund and must begin themselves to pay taxes on their payrolls . " This is the largest tax bill In history , " the speaker declared , " and to call it ' social security ' is a fraud on the working man . " The taxes start at the rate of $2 in taxes for every $100 of wages and increase to S6 for every $100. and the law provides for an equal division of these tax amounts between employer and employe . Governor Landon said that this would not work out and that the employer would tend to transfer his part of this tax to the consumer through higher prices . " That is the history of all such taxes , " he went on . " This is because the tax is imposed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay in business he must shift the tax to I some one else . " Do not forget this : Such an excessive tax on payrolls is beyond question a tax on employment . In prosperous times it slows down the advance of wages and holds back re-employment . In bad times it increases unemployment and unemployment breaks wage scales . The Republican party rejects any feature of any plan that hinders reemployment . " Tracks Use of Savings The Republican standard bearer 's most forceful criticism of the Social Security Act was in connection with what would happen to the ' worker 's savings , forcibly taken by the government . He said that the administration 's theory was that this money would go into a reserve fund to be invested at interest and that the interest would help pay the pensions . He declared that the drafters of the new law knew nothing about government finance . " Let us trace the process step by step , " the Governor continued . " The worker 's cash comes into the Treasury . What is done with it ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens when the Treasury buys government bonds ? " Well , at present , when there is a deficit , the Treasury gives the Treasury some nice new bonds in exchange for the cash which the Treasury gives the Treasury . Now what happens to the cash that the Treasury gives the Treasury ? The answer is painfully simple . We have good spenders at Washington , and they spend the cash that the Treasury gives the Treasury . " Now I know all this sounds silly , but it happens to be an accurate recital of what this administration has been foolish enough to enact into law . " Let me explain it in another way  --  in the simple terms of the family budget : " The father of the family is a kindly man , so kindly that he borrows all he can to add to the family 's pleasure . At the same time he impresses upon his sons and daughters the necessity of saving for their old age . " Every month they bring 6 per cent of their wages to him so that he may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . The father decides that the best investment is his own I 0 U , so every month he puts aside in a box his I 0 U , carefully executed , and , moreover , bearing interest at 3 per cent . " And every month he spends the money that his children bring him , partly in meeting his regular expenses and the rest in various experiments that fascinate him . " Years pass  --  the children grow old  --  the day comes when they have to open their father 's box . What do they find ? Roll after roll of neatly executed I 0 U 'S . " Governor Landon said that the government was preparing a plan , I the exact nature of which would not be known until after election , for keeping the employment records ofi working men and women who will ) come under the compulsory insurance plan . This , he declared , would I mean an army of investigators and bureaucracy and Federal snooping would flourish . " The Republican party will have I nothing to do with any plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , " the speaker said . In discussing unemployment insurance Governor Landon said that the attempt of the administration by use of its taxing power to force the States to enact unemployment insurance statutes was unheard of and unwise and ignored the value of learning from , the experience of the States in a field that is new in this country . " The impatient advocates of almost every social reform are disposed to seek the short cut of Federal action rather than to wait for the slower but more certain progress achieved under State auspices , " he declared . " If a State makes a mistake the effect is local and limited . With State action we avoid mistakes involving the whole country . As Woodrow Wilson said of State action , it ' has given speed , facility , vigor and certainty to the progress of our economic and political growth ' . "
