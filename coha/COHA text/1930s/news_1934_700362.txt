txt The city is faced by an estimated deficit of about $25,000,000 this year , a figure which may be increased by $10,000,000 or so if the water rates are cut , Controller W. Arthur Cunningham announced yesterday after an Intensive although brief study of the city 's finances . So serious is the situation , he said , that he can not see how the city can appropriate snore than $600,000 of the more than $1,000,000 which is needed to obtain CWA funds for unemployment relief . The State must make up the difference , he held . There is enough money in the city treasury or available as a result of the agreement with the bankers to assure the January payroll , he said . Beyond that he would not commit himself . It was indicated , however , that he and other members of the LaGuardia administration have little actual fear of any payless pay days for city workers . More Optimistic . Taking a more optimistic view of the financial situation , former Controller George announced last night that all the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been refunded almost completely , and that all borrowing requirements for budgetary purposes had been underwritten four years ahead , in accordance with the bankers ' agreement with the city . Mr. Cunningham went on to point out that as to money for snow removal the usual policy of selling special revenue bonds to the several sinking funds can be followed , for the present at least . However , he pointed out , his check shows there is only about $5,000,000 in surplus cash in the sinking funds . Since it costs upward of $1,000,000 for each severe snowstorm , he added , it is obvious that if too many storms or too many other emergencies arise the city will be pressed for cash . It is the hope of the LaGuardia administration , he said , that the budget can be balanced , as it must be to get Federal funds for subways and other public improvements , by means of economies . To this end , he indicated , It is essential that the drastic emergency legislation which the administration is asking be enacted into law by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this connection , he pointed out , since the budget must be balanced by the end a the month if the needed Federal aid is to be obtained . The Controller would not commit himself with regard to repeal of the much-discussed water rate increase . He showed extreme skep- ticism , however , as to any appreciable sum of money the city might get even if the five-cent taxicab ride tax , now in the courts , should be finally upheld . " Even it the city is successful in the courts , " he said , " there is a great question as to how much we could collect . Aside train the large companies I do n't know how much of the tax money has been put aside . We could take the cabs , but they would n't help much in meeting appropriations . " He was doubtful , too , as to the possibility of finding iew sources of revenue through license fees . " Always bear in mind , " he said , " that if we can get the legislation we would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it is , " he went on " that subject to further check there is n't much money in the city treasury . There are large cash balances , but , as every one knows , they are largely earmarked for special purposes . " The Controller made It plain that there Is enough money actually available to appropriate $1,000,000 for CWA purposes . To do so , however , he said , would likely create a serious situation a few months from now since then , according to the present outlook the fund allocated to work and home relief will become exhausted . Care must he taken in the spending of the $25 , - 000,000 still in the fund , he said , since the city 's relief program will cost an estimated $5,000,000 a month for the next few months . He made it clear that he intends to let the citizens of the city have complete information as to its financial status .

In December the city faced refunding or partial redemption of short-term securities amounting to $293,821,000 . Holders of $203,321,000 of revenue bills issued against arrears of taxes , which became delinquent prior to Nov. 1 , will be paid about $49,500 , - 000 , representing a 20 per cent payment on the securities . The remainder of the issue has been refunded through exchange of new three-year notes payable on Nov. 1 , 1936 . These operations , Mr. said , left only $4,300,000 net of the maturing issues which are gradually disappearing . The refunding renewals were made at an interest rate of 4 per cent , more favorable to the city than the previous rates of 4% to 5N . Corporate stock notes of $58,500 , - , MO issued in anticipation of longterm corporate stock issues were completely refunded for nine months at 5 per cent , against 53/4 and 6 per cent previously paid .

On Nov. 1 last $30,000 , - 000 in relief money remained in the city treasury to cover relief requirements to Sept. 1 next . All these refunding operations , the former Controller said , were preliminary to the establishment by the bankers of a four-year revolt ' 1ing fund for the city . Beginning on Jan. 1 these loans will be made against collection of taxes and to offset delinquencies in tax payments which may develop in the next four years . Mr. said the last three months in city financing had constituted a most trying teat of the practicability of the whole plan . With the successful refunding operations now completed , he said , the road was clear for the city to proceed with the four-year plan RI Self .

The total for current and previous tax levies received was $25,700,000 , against $8.910,000 for the same period in 1932 . Collections on account of tax arrears between Jan. 1 and Dec. 31 , 1933 , totaled $103,830,000 , or 136 , - 321,000 more than the receipts in 1932 . The Finance Department 's book show all budgetary requirements for 1933 had been discharged at the end of the year , while $1,300,000 remained unexpended , showing that the 1933 budget had been overestimated by that amount . The city still faces deficiencies on its capital spending accounts . Liabilities of that kind depending on corporate stock sales amount to about $15,000,000 , while liabilities for condemnation awards are $43,181,751 .
