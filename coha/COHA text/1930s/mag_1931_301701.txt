Last week Mr. Cox 's Daily News announced an experiment , charitable , interer-making , reader-getting . The paper had Discovered that in the nearby Miami valley " there are thousands of bushels of wheat selling at such a low price that a great deal of it will be fed to farm animals this winter ... a plenitude of supplies , and yet want involving more families than have ever gone hungry in the history of this country . " The Daily News said it would buy some of this wheat , give it to needy folk endorsed by the Dayton Family Welfare Association . If the family had a coffee grinder it could make whole wheat muffins , cakes . or breads , or else soak the wheat for 48 hours and make porridge . The Daily News hoped : " If this method can be demonstrated , then it may spread all over the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tribune used to chalk up on a blackboard each silly question that one staff member asked another . High man for the week was supposed to stand his contemporaries a drink or drinks . No living man ever scored highest , however . <P> High score for silly talk was always given to the late great Stephen Decatur , whose **26;11386;TOOLONG speech runs in the Tribune 's massed-head as its slogan . When Col. Robert Rutherford McCormick , publisher of the Tribune , made his annual inspection visit , someone was told off to stand in front of the score board . Last week Publisher McCormick , inspecting his Paris branch , had other things to think of beside blackboards . He learned that his European paper had been wizened to its winter size ( eight and twelve pages ) all summer , that the competing U.S. daily , the Paris Herald , had been light too but was distributing 34,000 net paid copies to the Tribune 's padded 14,000 . Publisher McCormick was reported planning a shakeup . <P> After 91 years in business , last week the London Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the paper 's fate had been sealed since the disappearance of its associated journal , the Daily Chronicle , a year ago . David Lloyd George was once financially interested in the Sunday News . Six months ago prolific Author-Playwright Edgar Wallace acquired control , wrote theatrical criticism in it , gave horse-race tips , scattered his name and the name of his multifarious works throughout the paper . The Sunday News will be incorporated with the Sunday Graphic , a tabloid picture paper . <P> Founded in 1889 by Drygoodsman John Wanamaker , bought and made into one of the first great crusading journals 17 years later by Butterick Publishing Co. , discontinued in January 1930 , last week Everybody 's was revived as a cheap true-story vehicle .
