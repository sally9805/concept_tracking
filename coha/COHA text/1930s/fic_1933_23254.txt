GOLDEN SUNSET A STORY BY LEONARD HESS 1 ' ALLOWES would come on her in the barn and look at her with gray eyes that had been pleading with her for three years . For a man who worked on a farm , he was remarkably sallow . Yet his health was good . Labor did not tire him any more than it tired the other hands . His sallowness had more to do with Fallowes ' spirit than with his body . He was tall and lank . A curling lock of hair , dark chestnut in color , fell down over his high , narrow forehead . At the temples the forehead was bony . He would look at Hannah Eastman . The sunlight , gilding the powder of straw and grain afloat in the air , would make the girl appear as in a golden nimbus ; and Fallowes would be almost hurt by her beauty . Not all men would have called her beautiful . She had a round , sweet face , but her nose was rather flat and her mouth too wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Fallowes saw all this , but his fondness transfigured the blemishes . She was a stalwart girl , a real farm girl , heroic in her build . Fallowes would look at her , saying nothing about what moved in his heart . Then he would make a remark about some detail of the farm . Or he would come on her in the fields . She performed all sorts of chores , in the white farmhouse , in the barn , in the fields . She did all the kitchen work . She sewed . She helpedwith the planting and the harvesting . She fed the animals . She was on her feet from dawn until bedtime . She was , in Fallowes ' estimation , a drudge . He had hired himself out to Raines , the farmer , three years ago , when the farm of his own people had fallen under the auctioneer 's hammer . He was the youngest among five children . Because of his pallor , his soft eyes , his passion for books , and his introspective habits , the family had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others was like him . His father had been a very Iazy man , and the farm had run down-hill steadily . In the grandfather 's time it had flourished , and the Falloweses had been people of standing in the district . One spring evening James had been walking in the woods , along the creek on the western border of the farm , and there he had found his father lying on the stones , with his head in the water . He had been shot in the back . " Yes , " the others had said when James came staggering into the house with his face horror-twisted ; he was carrying his father on his back  --  and he could not help thinking of fEneas , who had carried the old Anchises from burning Troy ; only Anchises was alive while Fallowes was dead ? " yes , " they cried , " we did hear a shot ! " In the woods James had not heard any noise , except the scurrying of the wild creatures over the sere , fallen leaves and among the crackling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not come to him when he was sunk in thought . One of the trespassers on the land , whom the dead farmer had threatened with the law , had probably shot him . The investigation came to nothing . Soon afterward the farm was sold , the family was scattered , and James crossed the hills to hire himself out to Raines . There he had found Hannah Eastman . His father 's death had Ieft an emptiness inside him , and Hannah was like balm on an open wound . James had not suspected that his father had meant much to him . It might be that he had not meant much , but his tragic end and the callous way the other sons and the two daughters took it , especially after the reading of the poor will , moved something that was deep down in James and caused him to think . He knew his father had been a lazy man , but now he understood that he had been a lonely one at the same time , a man who had not been able to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonely . He could not talk much either . He began to wonder what other traits he had inherited from his father . When he looked at Hannah his head emptied itself of everything but the girl . His head would swim in cloudy regions at the sight of her . He knew this was love . He had spent some time with women in the towns , though without really thinking about them ; but he wanted to marry Hannah . It was only his eyes that spoke to her about it now , because she had already turned him down , three times . Nevertheless , she did not object to his eyes pleading with her . Until he had come to the farm she had not believed any man could want to have anything to do with her in a respectable manner . She had never met with any disagreeable experiences , which could have putsuch an idea as that into her head . She was twenty-three years old , and it might be imagined that she could not have reached that age without some of those experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raines , her aunt , saw to it . " The best of them are no good , " Mrs. Raines said . Hannah had been living on the farm since her thirteenth year , and all that while her aunt had dinned that into her ears . " The best of them are no good . " Perhaps that was the truth . The farm-hands , and other men too , had looked at her from time to time in a way which caused Hannah to feel strange , as if she were a sapling in the spring of the year , and the sap had suddenly begun to seethe painfully in her ; or a young heifer , or a colt , ready to fly madly around a field . She dreaded that feeling and , clearly , the men were to blame for it . " They ca n't keep their eyes off a woman , " said Mrs. Raines . " It 's their eyes  --  or their hands , if you give them the least chance . " She said some nasty things about men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and always kind to Hannah . Raines had only one passion ; it was politics . Every other word that came from his somewhat slack , bearded lips concerned the political situation . He maintained that the farmers were the backbone of the country and that such an important fact ought not to wait so long for general recognition . He ranted about it . His wife was sick of heating this and she said he was a fool . He was well off . What more did he want ? " If men are n't beasts then they 're fools , " she said to Hannah . " You take my advice , do n't you ever get married . You 'll regret it if you do to the day you die . " In men 's eyes , therefore , the girl nearly always saw an ugly thing . Mrs. Raines , like all schemers , had an argument for absolving herself from guilt . She told herself she was saving Hannah from future trouble . She had a smug face but with the lines of great will-power stamped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be intelligent , but closer acquaintance would reveal her mental capacities as factitious ; it was simply her method . of forcing her way to her goal that gave the impression of intelligence . In this respect she was like a great many financiers . Hannah was her brother 's daughter , and an orphan . It was Raines who had brought Hannah to the farm when the child 's parents had died , within two weeks of each other , of typhoid fever . The little boy too had died of it . Mrs. Raines had not especially welcomed her niece , who arrived in a bewildered condition , her face swollen from crying , and in shapeless clothes which needed mending . The girl had worn broken , distorted clumps of shoes . Mrs. Raines was very handsome and dark . She dressed like a city woman , making trips to New York twice a year , to replenish her wardrobe according to the latest fashions . She had not liked her brother , and the dislike seemed to carry over to his child . Her brother had understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had told her bluntly that she had married Charles Raines for his money and because he was of an old , good family . So she had . She knew site had . Her womanly instincts were frigid , and it is possible that her first contact with the farmer , who blindly worshipped her because of her beauty , was what aroused in her hercontemptof men . It was Raines ' passion for her which had slowly changed into his passion for politics . Mrs. Raines never forgave her brother his sharp perceptions , andshe never would forgive him even now that he was in his grave . She never would like Hannah . But she saw Hannah 's value to her . That was why James Fallowes had found the girl there , a drudge . Mrs. Raines meant to keep Hannah . Mrs. Raines would sit in the parlor of the white farmhouse , among the furniture with the solid mahogany woodwork , and the antimacassars , and the Brussels carpet , and the lithographs on the walls with the blue-flowered wallpaper , and the lamps which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old oil lamps . She had good taste . She did not mean to destroy the aristocratic values of the old parlor . She would sit there , reading a novel and doing never a stitch of work . Hannah did everything . Mrs. Raines ' hands were long and white . Or she would walk in her flower garden under a white silk parasol . Her brother used to say of her , " She gives herself airs . " If Hannah were ever to marry , Mrs. Raines would have to do without her . She made a strict church-goer of Hannah to guard against an illicit entanglement with a man , which might Iead to marriage . But in James Fallowes ' eyes Hannah did not see the ugly thing she believed she saw in other men 's . Then he asked her to marry him . She had an impulse to run from him and to tell her aunt about it , but she did not do that . Her aunt might order Fallowes to leave the farm . Hannah said " no " to Fallowes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter . He happened to know how her aunt had spoken to Hannah about marriage . Then , some months later , he asked her again . He asked her three times . After that his eyes went on asking her . Presently  --  soon after the time at which this story begins  --  his eyes began to ask her something else . And yet it was not as when other men 's eyes asked her  --  or so she imagined  --  for that . The others ' eyes seemed shifty or crude , while Fallowes ' looked straight into her , searching out her heart , which would tremble but remain unafraid . She began to like this . Sometimes she would stand hidden where Fallowes could not see her , and she would look at him as he worked in his blue overalls ; and once or twice after some minutes had passed she came from her hiding-place and deliberately went to where he was , so that he should look at her in his special way . He still wanted to marry her but he said to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She would not . Life was a taste of bitter almonds in his mouth . He could not help his eyes looking on Hannah with desire , though he was sure nothing would come of that either . In his dreams he saw her tawny hair . Like his own family , Hannah also thought James Fallowes something of a weakling even while she saw him doing his daily labors with browned , hard muscles . There was a queer aura of ineffectiveness about him which sometimes made the girl want to shun him . Her strong frame , with its closeness to the earth , did not want to accept his frame . She felt they were not made for each other . Yet when she was near Fallowes she did not think at all of what her aunt said about men . Although Fallowes too worked on a farm , and his arms to the elbows were encrusted with loam , and his shirt was dark with sweat , he did not seem to be close to the earth as Hannah was . She could not think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom , she wildly threw a conjecture toward marriage  --  for the briefest instant only  --  it was not a man like James Fallowes she would see herself with . He was tall , but to her he did not seem like a big man . So lie was able to lookstraight at her without her becoming terrified . Beyond the outmost field of the Raines ' farm , across the stone wall , was a field all run to seed . Grasses and weeds grew breast-high . There had been a farm there a long time ago , and there was still a barn in the field , standing awry with boards askew and gaping open and ashen in hue . In places the sky gleamed through yawning spaces . When the wind blew the barn became a trumpet . When the rain fell the barn was a sponge . Its red paint had been washed off years before . The farmhouse had burned down , and the charred foundations were lost under rolling grass . The barn stood alone . Nobody was ever seen to go into it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immediate countryside , and only children might have gone into the empty barn to play . Tramps might have used it in the darkness as a shelter , but no one saw them . Where the ashen structure stood against the sky was an inactive place . Suddenly one early summer evening , just before sundown , it sprang into a terrible activity . Hannah was at the stone wall on the Raineses ' side , where currant bushes grew thickly ; she plucked the red , glassy berries and dropped them into a pail . Everything had been still , very still , with an evening stillness , and then everything was full of shouts and clamor , as if the evening had exploded . The farm hands , including James Fallowes , had run to the stone wall . The Raineses were there . Three automobiles filled with State troopers had swept along the State road . These troopers sprang out of the cars and ran into the field where the old barn toppled against the redness in the sky , and then Hannah saw another bunch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the field from the scrub of low trees on the far side . She could see them only from their breasts up , with the tall grass bending before them . " They 're surrounding the barn , " said someone . " It 's Smiling Boy Atwell in the barn , " another hand said . It was Smiling Boy Atwell . He had come this way . He had been sheltered in the barn a few days perhaps . He was a killer . At the post office they had said he was somewhere in the district , hiding out , and the farm hand put two and two together . The barn with the troopers cautiously converging upon it was as quiet as death . The farm people heard a shout which sounded like , " Come out , surrender . " Then the troopers all sank into the grass . The sunset began to flame . Hannah felt a hand grip her wrist , and she was pulled downward . " They may fire . " It was Fallowes . " Get down . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In fact there was a shot . Everyone ducked under the wall but peered above it . The shot echoed loudly through the vault of the surrounding stillness . The grass of the wild field moved in dark streaks , where the troopers were creeping through it toward their quarry . A crack in the barn side spat out an orange flame . All the sound that came was " Ping ! " A roar from the rifles in the field rolled over the landscape , the bullets rattled into the wood of the barn , and smoke hung lazily over the grass . Then , " Ping ! Ping ! Ping ! " The cornered bandit must have been scurrying all over the barn as fast as he could and shooting through apertures and knot-holes here , there , everywhere . His unseen , frantic movements made Hannah 's heart thump violently . Fallowes ' hand was still tight on her wrist . She was aware of it , then she forgot about it , and let it remain there . " Ping ! Ping ! Ping ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He must be running round in there like a rabbit , " Hannah said to herself . She pictured to herself a small , rabbit-like man . She did not know whether it were pity she felt or terror or what ; but her heart banged against her ribs . She pressed her free hand to her gray , woolly dress where her breast was . The roar of the rifles was steady , drowning out the " Ping ! Ping ! " " He 's certainly making a fight for it ! " said a hand . " They 're bound to get him , " Raines said . Then he muttered , " The whole infernal system is wrong ! " He often ranted about the " System . " Hannah pictured the small man scurrying in the barn , fighting off death . The sunset turned to a bright gold . The field turned bright gold . The old barn was bright gold . It was a beautiful picture , like a picture of gold in a vivid dream , and Hannah pressed the hand harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Hannah had lived with them , all your life  --  the palpable objects of the world turning to a golden unreality  --  and maybe you wo n't see them after a while , unless you are like James Fallowes . Hannah until this strange moment had not really seen them . Now she saw . The picture penetrated into her because a man was about to die . Within her was a horrible tumult , yet the beauty reigned over all . It was a golden sunset , but too cruel . " Ah ! " somebody exclaimed . A figure had appeared in the doorway of the barn . It stalked boldly forward . The " pings " had stopped . GOLDEN With no bullets left , Smiling Boy Atwell had come out to face death . There he stood . He advanced out of the doorway and stood against the sunset glow , which was beginning to lose its gold beneath shades of lavender . Hannah stared at him . She rose up , above the wall . When Fallowes jerked her back she wrested her wrist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on her feet , staring at Smiling Boy Atwell . He was not a small , rabbitlike man at all . He was large . He was immense . He was huge against the glow of the sunset . Hannah 's heart beat madly . Atwell seemed the largest man she had ever seen . He looked as though he were planted there and growing straight out of the earth . He looked more vibrant than anyone she had ever seen before this moment . Her heart leaped to him across the field . He was too far away from her for her to see his eyes . All she saw was his immense , solid stalwartness . Fallowes groped at her to drag her down , and she was angry . All Fallowes ' strange qualities of body and incomprehensible mind seemed to nag at her , and when he groped again she gave him a push . He let go her wrist . Her large body squared itself front to front with the great body of the man against the sunset , whose eyes she could not see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapped at her . Her aunt was a sack of fine garments , huddled close against the wall . But Hannah did not get down . She stood front to front with that man as if consecrating herself to him . " They wo n't shoot ! " she cried scornfully . " They wo n't kill him now ! " She was mistaken about that . You could not take chances with Smiling Boy Atwell . One of the State troopers whose cousin , another State trooper , the Smiling Boy had killed , now killed the Smiling Boy . Bang , bang , bang , bang ! Out of the grass came the licks of flames and the curling gray smoke ; and the echoes bounded along the rims of the far hills . The big figure pitched forward . A choked cry came from Hannah 's throat . A cry of outrage . The field broke into shouts . The khaki men sprang up and began to run toward the fallen figure . The farm men vaulted the stone wall and pressed through the high grass . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hannah stayed where she was , with her large red hands clenched on the top of the rough stones of the wall and her body leaning forward . Fallowes , feeling sick , turned away and walked toward the well . He drank avidly from the tin cup . His throat was hot . The world seemed staggering all round him . Hannah watched a procession forming , a line of khaki , with trailing rifles that reflected the waning gleams of the sunset . The sky overhead was pale green . The farm people followed the khaki as far as the road . Something was placed in a car , and the cars moved off with the troopers that had come out of the scrub woods standing on the running-boards . The cars flashed away on the gray road . Mrs. Raines got to her feet and brushed twigs and dirt from her silks . The color was coming back into her cheeks . " It 's time for supper , " she said to Hannah . She went into the house . Hannah may have heard her but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone wall . Her heart was now beating with a slow , enlarged thud . The farmers returned to the Raines farm . Hannah heard their voices , excitedly talking about what had happened . Darkness began to close in . The fields were dark gray and blue , the ashen , broken barn took on a ghostly appear-ance . Hannah climbed over the wall and made her way over the field . Nettles bit her legs , and her woolly dress was stuck full of grasses . She pushed on . She had no thought clear in her head , and she stepped over the spot where the Smiling Boy had fallen and went inside the barn and looked round , though she was not really looking for anything . It was simply that something vital had happened here . She found a rusted wheelbarrow , sat down on it and looked around her . Her hands were folded in her lap . Through the chinks of the decrepit walls and roof the last shreds of evening light came in , but when they darkened away , Hannah still did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barn was a cavern of gloom . There was even yet a smell of burned powder , but a breeze sprang up and presently drove the smell out . The sweetness of the field came in . She heard a step on the creaking floor-boards and she turned slowly to see . James Fallowes was there . In the gloom he too looked bigger than usual . " I saw you coming over here , " he said . " What are you staying here for so long ? What are you doing here ? " " I just thought I 'd come and look around . " He sat down beside her on the wheelbarrow . They did not speak . It was almost entirely black in the barn now ; but Hannah could feel Fallowes ' eyes on her . Then she felt his hand on her arm . She did not stir . The hand moved slowly , wistfully , along her arm and paused under her right breast . Fallowes ' arm was round her . Her heart began to go more quickly again . The barn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster and faster . The wild-run field , now a blue-black stretch beyond the wide barn-door , sent up sharp night odors , and the breeze wafted the odors into the barn , and they flurried round Hannah and Fallowes sitting in the darkness . Hannah was conscious of the odors as she had been conscious of the golden picture . Fallowes kissed her on the mouth . Then he rose and stooped over her , and she did not stir , and he looked in the darkness very big , immense , solid , like a figure belonging to the earth . He made a sort of grunt in his throat . Hannah then looked up quickly . He took hold of her and raised her powerfully from the wheelbarrow and crushed her against him . When Smiling Boy had died the world , under a wave of horror , had gone dead to Fallowes . Life must not go out like that , and so he wanted to bring it alive again . It cried deafeningly inside him . He found it alive in Hannah . He began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not scuffling . She believed she saw his eyes glitter . She shut hers . He was pulling at her , toward the floor . She let herself sink down . Something must happen , to obliterate the death of Smiling Boy Atwell , but she was not thinking , she was not exactly feeling either . She was in a dark emptiness . Fallowes ' kisses were all over her . She made no resistance to him . His hands were soothing . " Or their hands all over you , " her aunt had said . But that seemed long ago and curiously untrue . When she entered the farmhouse her aunt glared at her . " Well , where have you been , if you please ? " " I 'm going to marry Jim Fallowes , " Hannah said . She passed her astounded aunt , and walked slowly , solidly , into the kitchen .
