Smiling pinkly , the only living ex-President of the U. S. reached Brussels last week on his first visit to Europe in nearly 20 years . Every Belgian paper , from Communist to Rexist , dropped its bickering to honor Herbert Clark Hoover , Belgium 's Wartime Relief Administrator , with fulsome editorials . Every member of the Chamber of Representatives rose in his seat at word that Herbert Hoover had crossed the frontier . Dinners and receptions were held by the Foreign Office , the University of Louvain , the College of Burgomasters and Aldermen . The Belgian Government issued a new stamp , bearing the portrait of the late great King Albert , but dedicated to Herbert Hoover . <P> In return Herbert Hoover laid wreaths on the tombs of King Albert and Queen Astrid , visited the Royal Palace , forgathered with veterans of the old Commission for Relief in Belgium , said : " I am happy , really happy , to be in Belgium again . " <P> Young Belgians who never knew the War have especially good cause to be grateful for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of donors and what cautious Administrator Hoover considered the real need of Wartime Belgians left the Belgian Relief Fund with a whopping surplus of $25,000,000 when the books were closed in 1919 . This was split three ways : $9,000,000 to rebuild Belgium universities , $6,000,000 for a foundation for scientific research , $10,000,000 for exchange scholarships between Belgium and the U. S.
