Last year Harold L. Ickes and Robert Houghwout Jackson handed U. S. Business the Administration 's Christmas greetings in the form of a pair of diatribes about " economic oligarchy " and " the 60 families . " Implication was that they would be followed by a similarly vehement message from the President to Congress , suggesting revision of U. S. anti-trust laws . Anxiously awaited by Business ever since , the business monopoly message from the nation 's greatest governmental monopolist finally appeared last week . A detailed request for Congressional investigation of the whole subject of monopoly as a preliminary to future legislation to curtail it , it was chiefly noteworthy for a tone as mild as Messrs . Ickes &; Jackson had been bitter . <P> Simple Truths . Read to Congress the day after Governor La Follette 's launching of a new party in Madison , Wis. ( see p. 12 ) , the President 's message opened with some strikingly similar themes : <P> " Unhappy events abroad have retaught us two simple truths about the liberty of a democratic people . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic State itself . That , in its essence , is fascism-ownership of government by an individual , by a group or by any other controlling private power . <P> " The second truth is that the liberty of a democracy is not safe if its business system does not provide employment and produce and distribute goods in such a way as to sustain an acceptable standard of living . Both lessons hit home . Among us today a concentration of private power without equal in history is growing . " <P> Statistics . To prove his point that current concentration of economic power is unexampled , the President quoted familiar statistics from reports to the Bureau of Internal Revenue : 1 ) .1% of U. S. corporations own 52% of all corporate assets , get 50% of all corporate income , less than 5% of U. S. corporations own 87% of the assets and less than 4% of manufacturing corporations get 84% of their net profits ; 2 ) even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dividends and 3 ) in 1936 , 33% of all inheritances went to 4% of all heirs . Taking this as premise No. 1 , the President proposed as premise No. 2 that the concentration was due to monopolistic trends in U. S. business . His conclusion was that " a thorough study of the concentration of economic power in American industry and the effect of that concentration upon the decline of competition " should be undertaken by the Federal Trade Commission , Department of Justice and Securities &; Exchange Commission , for whom he recommended appropriating $500,000 . In addition , the President requested $200,000 more to enable the Department of Justice-whose Assistant Attorney General Thurman Arnold ( The Folklore of Capitalism ) was last week telling a New York audience about his plan to publicize antimonopoly prosecutions-to enforce existing anti-trust laws .
