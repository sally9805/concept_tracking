When a knight , even a Jewish knight , has been appointed Governor General of a British Dominion , he has every right to expect that he will be made a peer the next time His Majesty makes a batch of peers . <P> As the 66th birthday of George V rolled round last week , Australians expected that among the " birthday honors " would be a peerage for Sir Isaac Isaacs , new Australian Governor General , only native-born G. G. of a British Dominion ( TIME , May 5 , Dec. 15 , 1930 ) . When the Honors List was published at London , Australians were disappointed . Native Sir Isaac Isaacs got nothing-possibly because of the unconcealed anger of George V , who objected vigorously when the Australian Government refused to accept the Duke of York as Governor General , forced His Majesty to appoint Sir Isaac , a man whom he did not " even know by sight " ( TIME , Dec. 15 ) . <P> Jews in general were not disappointed by George V last week . Mr. Montague Burton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest merchant tailor , became " Sir Montague . " The Jewish assistant Secretary of the General Post Office , Mr. Leon Simon , became ' ' Sir Leon . " Others who received Birthday Honors last week were : <P> Albert Montefiore Hyamson , Jewish Chief Immigration Officer of Palestine : Order of the British Empire . <P> Sigfried Hoofien , general manager of the Orient Anglo-Palestine Co . Ltd. : Order of the British Empire . <P> Plainly and obviously the distribution of these honors was a move by Prime Minister James Ramsay MacDonald to regain the Jewish favor he lost at the time of the Palestine crisis ( TIME , Nov. 3 ) . Anxious , too , about Arab goodwill in Palestine , Mr. MacDonald " advised " ( i. e. caused ) His Majesty to knight Zahda Haddad , Arab Medical Officer at Haifa . <P> With a second Indian Round Table Conference looming at London , now is obviously the time to honor Indians , and many figured in last week 's Honors List . <P> Only British M. P. to be knighted was sturdy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , onetime weaver , now textile union head . In general the Honors List reflected Scot MacDonald 's disapproval of the peerage-no new peer was created. * <P> There are signs that the Labor Party will try to fight the next election on a platform of " Reform the House of Lords ! " By " reform " the average Laborite understands a complete emasculation of the powers of the House of Lords , preparatory to its abolition . <P> Harmless items on last week 's List were : <P> A baronetcy for Sir Edward Elgar , composer of what has become a ' ' sound effect " in the newsreels : Pomp and Circumstance . <P> Creation of Actress Sybil Thorndike , " foremost British tragic actress , " a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire . <P> A baronetcy for Sir Herbert Gibson , rich British resident of Buenos Aires , this being his reward for his aid in puffing &; pushing Edward of Wales 's British Empire Trade Exposition in Argentina . <P> <P> *Peerages and baronetcies are hereditary , knighthoods die with the holder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . A knight is " Sir " by courtesy . In ascending order of rank , peers ( members of the House of Lords ) are barons , viscounts , earls , marquesses , dukes .
