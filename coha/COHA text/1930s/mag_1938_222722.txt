Crown Prince Umberto obliged Dictator Benito Mussolini last week with a few personal appearances in the Italian Tyrol . Arriving at flag-bedecked. half-Austrian Bolzano ( formerly Bozen ) , guarded by soldiers and Black Shirts , His Royal Highness inaugurated a public works program . He then visited Merano where he dedicated a monument to Italian Alpine troops . Meanwhile , his Belgian consort , Crown Princess Maria Jose , inspected welfare centres . <P> The royal visit was plainly calculated as a gesture which would impress and cheer up the 250,000 unhappy , German-speaking Italian Tyroleans , former subjects of the pomp-displaying Habsburg emperors , more than any blustering , oratorical visit by II Duce could . Living quietly in Naples , the tall , 33-year-old heir to the crown of Italy has been none too ardent a believer in Fascism , has silently but successfully sidestepped Fascist activities . <P> The mountainous South Tyrol sticks out as the weakest spot in the Berlin-Rome axis . Promise of this 30-mile , largely vertical strip along the Italian-Austrian border was part of the secret deal which in 1915 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her former Central Powers allies . No minorities treaty was signed by Italy , but until minority-hating Fascism 's advent there was little oppression of the German population . In 1923 a determined program of oppressive " Italianization " was inaugurated . In the district 's schools only Italian teachers conducting lessons in Italian were allowed . Germanic names were ordered Italianized . Until 1936 German could not be spoken publicly . No German secret society could be formed , officials were exclusively Italian , Italian-German marriages generally resulted in social ostracism . <P> Although Fhrer Adolf Hitler 's main plank is return of all German minorities to the Reich fold , his passiveness toward the South Tyroleans has contrasted with his agitation for the Sudeten Germans of Czechoslovakia . To South-Tyrolean Anschluss agitation the Fhrer has lately turned a cold shoulder , has declared Italy 's present frontiers inviolable , has let the word be passed around that Ally Mussolini should not be embarrassed by Nazi agitation for a German Tyrol.                    @
