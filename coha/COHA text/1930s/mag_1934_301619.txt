Last week for the first time the 73rd Congress turned Indian-giver on President Roosevelt . Last year , in the first flush of the New Deal , it had delegated to him enormous executive power to purge the veterans ' pension roll and readjust government wages as a means of balancing the ordinary budget . Last week , under the lash of two of the most potent lobbies in Washington , it snatched back that power from the White House and returned pension reform to the pork barrel . <P> The issue stemmed directly from the Economy Act which the new Congress passed in March 1933-on the President 's say-so and almost with its eyes closed . That measure , often acclaimed as the Administration 's longest single step forward toward governmental reform , authorized the President to reduce the pay of government employes by 15% , to cut veterans ' pensions and weed out those who were drawing compensation for injuries not even remotely connected with the War . Budget savings of $625,000,000 were important but more important was the principle of administrative instead of legislative control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and government employe lobbies have been busy trying to induce Congress to turn back the new leaf . Little by little , the President gave ground to forestall Congressional revolts . His regulations were liberalized and more &; more veterans were permitted to remain on the pension rolls with the result that the first paper savings of $460,000,000 shrank to $300,000,000 . But the President managed to preserve the principle of the Economy Act-to keep off pensions those veterans whose injuries &; illnesses were " presumed " by old statutes to have been acquired in service if they had developed within six years after the War . <P> In January under a " gag rule " the House passed the Independent Offices Appropriation bill providing money for pensions and government salaries in the form the Administration wanted it . But the Senate , where no gag rule prevails , upset everything by voting back the Federal pay cuts and practically all the pension cuts . The House on a second go-round restored two-thirds of the Federal pay cut , and 75% of their former pensions to " presumptives . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 1933 Economy Act , but it did wipe out the principle of executive control of pensions and salaries . <P> Before he started south , the President vetoed the bill and his veto was instantly overridden ( 310-to-72 ) by the House ( TIME , April 2 ) . Last week was the Senate 's turn to be an Indian-giver . In a reasonable , sweet-tempered veto message the President had promised still further restorations of pensions to veterans for the sake of preserving his New Deal principle . Said he : " What you and I are seeking is justice and fairness . . . . It goes without saying that I shall not hesitate to make further changes if the principles of justice demand them . . . . My disapproval of this bill is not based solely on the consideration of dollars and cents . . . . You and I are concerned with the principles herein enunciated . . . . "
