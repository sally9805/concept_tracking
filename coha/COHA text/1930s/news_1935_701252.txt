" I wish the crowd would disperse ; this is humiliating , " police credited him with commenting when detectives , a tear gas gun in reserve , ducked a flying slate and battered down the door of the family 's ramshackle mansion on a once fashionable street . Irvin IL Mills , a violin maker , posting much of a $1,300 bond for himself and his wife in gold , denied that his son , Barton , was a delinquent although he never had been to a school , a church or a motion picture , " We taught him ourselves and by travel , " Mills explained . He now has the mentality of a 21 year old youth .                @ @ @ @ @
