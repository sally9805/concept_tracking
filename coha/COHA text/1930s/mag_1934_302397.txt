Stand Up and Cheer ( Fox ) contains a penguin dressed to resemble Jimmy Durante ; a song called " I 'm Laughin ' " ; a grand finale parade , showing Hollywood chorus boys and girls waving their arms in time to ah anthem called " We 're Out of the Red . " None of these is any better than it sounds . <P> Cinemaddicts who do not consider that any performance by a child actress constitutes cruelty to adults may be pleased with the demure wrigglings of four-year-old Shirley Temple . Among other features of Stand Up and Cheer are two U. S. Senators ( Mitchell and Durante ) who proceed from an argument about the tariff to a slapstick vaudeville tumbling act ; a scene in which Stepin Fetchit goes wading in a goldfish bowl hoping to catch a haddock ; a pleasing song called " Baby Take a Bow . " <P> The plot of Stand Up and Cheer , suggested by Will Rogers , concerns the efforts of a U. S. Secretary of Amusements ( Warner Baxter ) and his pretty assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with government-supervised vaudeville acts . The picture aims to combine spontaneity and grandeur , succeeds in being an erratic and mildly entertaining musicomedy which makes the tedious mistake of harping on Depression . <P> Shirley Temple is the daughter of a branch manager of California Bank in Santa Monica . Associate Producer Lew Brown , who discovered Jackie Cooper , chose her for Stand Up and Cheer from a group of 200 child actresses who answered a general call . She had already learned to sing by imitating radio crooners . She learned most of her tap-dancing in three weeks on the Fox lot . Blonde and pretty , Shirley Temple signed her own contract with an " X. " <P> <P> Men in White ( Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ) stays well inside the stern plot of Sidney Kingsley 's play which is one of this year 's strong contenders for the Pulitzer Prize . Dr. George Ferguson ( Clark Gable ) is an able young surgeon interning at St. George 's Hospital . His fiancee , Laura Hudson ( Myrna Loy ) , feels that he pays too much attention to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for postponing an engagement , he spends a careless night with a pretty resident nurse ( Elizabeth Allan ) . The result of this misdemeanor is the gruesome climax of Men in White : a hysterectomy following an infective abortion . Dr. Ferguson does the operating . Dr. Hochberg ( Jean Her-sholt ) , the surgeon who runs St. George 's hospital and considers Dr. Ferguson his most promising interne , persuades Laura Hudson to watch it . Going under ether , the nurse babbles enough to explain the cause of her predicament . Laura Hudson faints , has to be carried from the operating room . The nurse dies . At the end of Men in White it looks as if some good may come of what has happened . <P> There are times in Men in White during which Director Richard Boleslavsky allows his excitement over the glossy interiors of St. George 's , its shiny washrooms , its clean corridors and the house telephone service to get in the way of a simple , disagreeable story . More outspoken and more serious than the cinemas of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film is a harrowingly honest document . Good shot : Laura Hudson learning the lesson Dr. Hochberg wants to teach her , from Dr. Ferguson 's impatient fury when she touches him , sterile after his scrub-up , with her bare hands in the operating room .
