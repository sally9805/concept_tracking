The gallows in my garden , people say , Is new and neat and adequately tall . -G . K. Chesterton . <P> Adequate though small is Engelbert Dollfuss . Last week the mite of a Chancellor ( 4 ft. 11 in. ) who holds the balance between Austria 's raging Nazis and scarcely less irate Socialists , decided that what he needed was a whopping gallows . Not since 1920 , when the death penalty was abolished , has there been such a thing in Austria . Engelbert Dollfuss called carpenters . With a mighty thwacking they built in the gloomy courtyard of Vienna 's district jail a monster gallows " adequately tall , " said to be the biggest ever reared in Austria . <P> Meanwhile Chancellor Dollfuss had declared martial law , " yielding to popular demands for the restoration of the death penalty , " as his Government neatly put it , adding : " The peaceful population of Austria naturally has nothing to fear . . . . On the other hand this measure is to be understood as meaning that henceforth perpetrators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent acts menacing the public safety will not be able to reckon with the light penalty hitherto specified in our laws . " <P> Enrolled to defend the Dollfuss Government last week were 8,000 newly uniformed and smartly armed persons called " assistant soldiers . " Under the Treaty of St. Germain the Austrian Republic is entitled to 30,000 volunteer soldiers . Britain , France and Italy , all pro-Dollfuss. agreed last summer to let Chancellor Dollfuss add the 8,000 reserve .
