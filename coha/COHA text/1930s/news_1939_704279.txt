txt Welfare Head Replies Commissioner Hodson Closes the Relief Debate for His Department There is an old saying that " no souls are saved after the first twenty minutes . " I have no intention of continuing further this correspondence with Judge O'Brien concerning relief administration . He has made up his mind and is not interested in the accumulated evidence with respect to the way in which the department is doing its job . To all that evidence he says " not in point . " The only thing that seems to he in point for the Judge is his own opinion . When he talks about the disintegration of families and social despair which we see all around us , he does not direct-. ly say that this suffering is the fault of the Department of Welfare , but he leaves the impression that the department is in some way accountable for this human distress . It woul , hardly seem necessary to point out to any reasonable person that widespread unemployment is due to basic industrial and economic conditions and that the Department of Welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available again . More than 600,000 men . women and children today are under constant care and receiving regular assistance . That may he statistics to the Judge . To me it is human service on a tremendous scale . The Judge has referred with specific detail to one case of a woman with six children and says that these children will have to be committed to a public institution because of the department 's refusal to assist . The name of this family is not known to me. but I think my subordinates have identified them . At any rate , there is one situation of a family with six children about which the department has had controversy with Judge O'Brien . Court Cooperation Sought The human facts in this situation are so complicated that I shall not undertake to relate them in detail , except to point out that in this family the husband and wife are living apart . The husband is receiving $35 a week in wages , or a total of $153 a month , vet the impression created by the Judge 's letter was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children would have to he sent . to an institution . This is not the fact , and the department stand : ready to supplement this income . if necessary . to prevent any such po ; =sibility. if the court will cooperate . Judge O'Brien , who . I am advised , has constantly criticized the present city administration on many fronts , requests an investigation of this department . I have no fear whatever of any investigation and have never opposed any of the investigations that have already taken place . We have had two investigations , one by the old Board of Aldermen and one by the present City Council . There have been studies of the department by two committees appointed by the Mayor and one by the Governor . We have been under investigation almost constantly since June , 1934 , and not or e of these investigations has uncovered anything of substantial importance other than suggestions for certain routine administrative reforms and more appropriations for the department . Committee 's Reaction Favorable Against the opinion of Judge O'Brien , may I quote Peter Grimm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor 's committee . which reported recently and said , among other things , the followiee : " Members of the hoard have been so favorably impressed by what t hey ha ' e seen of the adminietretion of relief that familiar untruths and inaccuracies ( so commonly believed ) have been completely swept away from their minds . We sincerely wish , therefore , that all our citizens might know the facts as we now know them . If it were possible for our citizens tosee the depth and nature of the need and the struggles that have been made to meet it , public opinion could probably be focused upon this sore spot in our economic life in such a way that a more fundamental solution to the problem might be found . " WILLIAM HODSON . Commissioner . Department of Welfare . New York , Oct. 31 , 1939 . City Pension Inquiries To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Councilman Abner C. Surpless in a letter to THE TIMES seeks to make capital of the " failure " of the city administration to take action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pension systems , and while I sympathize with his disappointment , it might he well to get the facts straight . The Mayor 's special pension commit ? tee , which was appointed shortly after the Council passed Mr. Surpless 's bill , on June 1 , 1938 , turned in a report on the Fire Department Relief Fund signed by President of the Council Newbold Morris , Controller Joseph D. , Councilman Charles Belous , Fire Commissioner John J. , Assistant Chief Joseph O'Hanlon , Vincent J. Kane , president of the Uniformed Firemen 's Association ; George B. Buck . actuary , Bureau of Retirement and Pensions ; Director of the Budget Kenneth Dayton and Paul Kern , president of the Civil Service Commission . The committee was appointed following a letter to President Morris dated April 5 , and the report from the committee was transmitted to the Council by the Mayor on Oct. 25 , 1938 , in a letter which concluded with the following paragraph : " I am transmitting the report to you with the suggestion that your honorable body study the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect to this fund and other funds as the facts warrant . " One may therefore question the correctness of Mr. Surpless 's statement that the committee " held a few meetings , and nothing further has been heard from it . " Shortly after the Council received this letter from the Mayor the Legislature convened and there was introduced the Babcock-Seelye bill , which would have solved the pensions problem for New York and other municipalities . Although I was in the midst of the agitation for pension reform , I do not recall that Mr. Surpless evinced any particular interest in the Babcock-Seelye bill . J. B. MILGRIM . Brooklyn , Oct. 29 , 1939 . Christianity as a Remedy Pope 's Encyclical Viewed as Pointing Way to World Peace To THE EDITOR or THE NEW YORK TIMES ! ' Pope Pius XII , in his first encyclical , has shown himself to be a great spiritual leader . Two features of this letter should be especially comforting to all those who call themselves Christians . First , His Holiness has no fear that the present war in Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put Christianity first because its preservation is the greatest need of humanity . The continuance of what we call civilization is of far less consequence because civilization only means a particular type of . civil organization . Christianity is the same yesterday , today and tomorrow , while every type and variety of Nye order is fortunately changing from time to time . Christianity has often changed types of civilization , as , for instance , when it finally eradicated human slavery among nations calling themselves civilized . There are millions of Christians outside the Church of Rome who agree with Pope Pius that God has made all men of one blood ; and that Christianity is the only power capable of making this blood relationship understandable and workable in a distraught world . As the Pope puts it , Christianity is the alpha and omega . It is a sad fact that the statesmen who rule the nations do not realize that their wisdom and strength are not enough to bring peace and good-will to the earth . There is but one sovereign remedy for all earthly ills , political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we call Christianity . Democracy is not enough . Th , ? only reason we esteem a democratic form of government is that so far man has not yet discovered anything better in secular statecraft . We know the corruption and incompetence which have been the earmarks of democracy for thousands of years : but experience has shown us that it is the best insurance policy against tyranny ; and we prefer freedom even if the structure of democracy reeks with greed and inefficiency . One of the defects of democracy is that its principal object is to enforce the will of the majority . One of the greatest perfections of Christianity is that its greatest concern is to protect the rights of a minority . " He that would be the first among you , let him he the least . " Pius XII is the only Pope who has reigned for the last thirty years that I. have not as yet seen . But I am certain he is a worthy successor of his distinguished predecessors . His encyclical just issued should be read by all the rulers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hitler . He has pointed out the great emedy of his Master for war and sin .. And let those who read the wonderful document hear in mind that there le no other remedy . HYACINTHE RINGROSE . New York , Oct. 29 , 1939 . Symbolism Distorted TO THE EDITOR OF the NEW YORK TIMES : . The magnificent . monuments in Union Square have apparently settled down for good , what , with Robert Moses ' park renovation there completed and attention directed elsewhere . The e:iticArian statue of George Washington and the nob.e one of Lincoln seem to be pieced in historical sequence , Washington in the forefront . But the beautiful and . expressive statue of Lafayette shrieks aloud at being compelled to turn his back upon Washington and offer his sword and France 's symbolical help to a store across the way . How could such a grievous error ir placing the statue which symbolically offers the help of France as well as hif own sword and himself to Washington he so stupidly placed ? The error must be ascribed to mischance and should be corrected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the whole pedestal should be turned 90 degrees and permit the figure with its offering gesture to face Washington 's statue , JOHN J. BRADLEY . New York , Oct. 30 , 1939 . Battery Bridge Gains an Enemy TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Although I could not enthuse much over the prospect of mussing up Battery . Park , which should be , but is n't , one of Manhattan 's most attractive pleasure grounds , until this morning my interest was languid and my neutrality pure and uncle : Hod , as between those who are whooping it along for the BatteryBrooklyn bridge and those who are crying it down . But since being painfully bunged in the eye by the sketch of the " ramp to Governors Island from proposed Battery Bridge " in THE NEW Yoiuc TIMER , I have become violently , one might say pathologically , unneutral . I now  - -  against the project at least 125 per cent , and as much more as my physical and mental forces and indignation can add to this percentage . One thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why Robert Moses , wh : has accomplished such distinguished and not-to-he-overpraised service in developing , beautifying and coordinating our parks , can bring himself to sponsor this bridge .
