A few Wall Street clerks and runners , several loafers , a handful of worshipers and some Roman Catholic nuns dropped in at odd times last week on Manhattan 's old Trinity Church to inspect a large cabinet in the nave . They beheld , behind glass , an illuminated statuet of Jesus Christ , praying in a Garden of Gethsemane in which every leaf and blade of grass was meticulously modeled and painted . Every four and one-half minutes the lights slowly dimmed and the haloed plaster head of Jesus raised slowly heavenward . This was " the first animated diorama ever made of a religious subject , " lent to Trinity by its makers , Diorama Corp . of America . <P> A diorama differs from a cyclorama , panorama or simple miniature group in that it is both three-dimensional and , from the spectator 's point of view , in true perspective . From front to back , a diorama 's figures and objects diminish in size , merging imperceptibly with a curved , painted background . Diorama Corp . is proud of its historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smithsonian Institution as well as for such firms as Ford and Sears Roebuck . Its President Edward Heckler Burdick conceived the idea of doing Christ in Gethsemane , to be followed by a half-dozen other Biblical scenes for possible exhibition at the New York World 's Fair in 1939 . <P> The Gethsemane diorama was lately on view at Diorama Corp . ' s Chicago offices . A Mrs. Ryan viewed it and , unaware that it is animated by electric motors , fainted when Christ 's head moved . She told her good friend , Trinity 's Rector Frederic Sydney Fleming , this experience and he got President Burdick to lend the diorama , valued at $7,500 , for the Easter season . <P> In Philadelphia last week several hundred clergymen were invited to the Planetarium donated by Soapman Samuel Simeon Fels to the Franklin Institute . They beheld ' ' The Easter Story , " projected not only with lights showing how the moon and sun determine the falling of Easter Sunday ( this year : March 28 ) but also-to the accompaniment of phonograph records and scripture readings-with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angels .
