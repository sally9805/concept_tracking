Loud-shirted John Jay Price , long chief cameraman for the extinct New York World , since 1927 operator of his own news picture service in Manhattan , is now rated by Publisher Roy Wilson Howard as " one of the country 's outstanding news photog-raphers . " Two years ago , however , Jack Price angered clannish press photographers by writing in Editor &; Publisher : " Photography is no longer the specialized profession , requiring many years to master . Any reporter can make a really good picture within a short time if he will give a little care and attention to a camera . " <P> Last week Photographer Price , on the theory that if reporters can handle cameras , photographers can manage typewriters , published his second book , * dedicated to the instruction of the " lads of the country whose goal is the camera staff of a newspaper . " Fellow photographers could temper their hostility by reading Jack Price 's ecstatic picture of a news cameraman : <P> " In a riot he must be among the rioters ; in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , often the unbidden guest . He sizzles at a fire and gets chilblains at a flood . He has been insulted and assaulted so often that some sympathetic States have enacted special legislation to protect him . <P> " Besides being a ubiquitous bird , an ace strategist and an untiring worker , he is a master technician with perfect control of the mechanisms that he operates . To the citizen who does not want his picture in print , the news photographer is Public Pain in the Neck No. 1 ; to others he is the symbol of opportunity . His body belongs to the city editor , he has no soul , and his life is lived between the pulmotor and Paradise . But without him all news would be colorless and the newspaper just a broad expanse of funereal type . " <P> *NEWS PICTURES-Round Table Press . Inc. ( $3.50 ) .
