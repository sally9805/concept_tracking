For the past seven years Conductor Arturo Toscanini , who dislikes mechanical music , has been steadfast in his refusal to make phonograph records . To him , his own performances always seemed short of perfection , hence unworthy of being perpetuated . During his last few months with the New York Philharmonic-Symphony ( TIME , May 11 et ante ) , RCA Victor doubled its efforts to persuade him to change his mind , pleaded that he owed it to the public and posterity . The Maestro 's " no " was unyielding until a friend suggested that he would be doing a real service to the composer he might interpret , that his records would help young conductors with their phrasing and their tempi . Result was the release last week of a Toscanini Wagner album , * which included the Preludes to the first and third acts of Lohengrin ; Dawn and Siegfried 's Rhine Journey from Gtterdmmerung ; the tender Siegfried Idyll , composed by Wagner as a Christmas serenade for his wife Cosima the year after their son Siegfried was born . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week sales were unparalleled , according to record dealers , since the days of Caruso . From headquarters in Camden . N. J. , RCA Victor reported that few other albums have sold so well in a year as Toscanini 's did in the first few days after its release . <P> &lt;FOOTNOTE*Victor ( $10 ) .
