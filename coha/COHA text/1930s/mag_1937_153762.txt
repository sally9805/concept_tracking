On the 30th floor of Chicago 's Board of Trade Building is a door with the legend MR . AUGUST KOCHS . Inside is a large suite whose three main features are Mr. Kochs himself , his secretary for 30 years , stout , clamp-lipped Miss Millie Bott , and a small oil painting of an alchemist by a 19th-Century German named Eickinger . Mr. Kochs considers the painting " appropriate " for he is himself a chemist of long standing and high success as president of Victor Chemical <P> Works . Victor is small potatoes beside gigantic Du Pont or Allied Chemical &; Dye , but in the specialized field of H3PO4 ( phosphoric acid ) and its derivatives Victor is tops . Its materials are used by the nation 's biggest makers of baking powder , Pharmaceuticals , dentifrices , fertilizers , matches and fireworks . Last week Mr. Kochs , though a modest man , was eager to tell the world about all this because Victor was making a public offering of stock for the first time in its 35-year career . <P> German-born , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago Heights after his father-in-law had acquired it in payment of a debt , incorporated it in 1902 . Losing regularly at first , he persuaded Cornelius Vanderbilt , President John R. Hegemen of Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. and Banker William A. Read to " take a flyer " with $150,000 . They never had cause to regret the move-business picked up in 1907 , and with the War Victor left its competitors behind . In 1920 it expanded by building a second plant in West Nashville , near Tennessee 's phosphate rock quarries . Until then the standard means of extracting phosphorus consisted of mixing the ore with sulphuric acid . In 1922 , however , a better method came into general use- mixing ore and sand in electric furnaces at high temperatures . This put August Kochs in a pretty fix , for competitors had tied up the southern power supply . Undaunted , Chemist Kochs adapted the blast furnace used by the steel industry , spent $500,000 in experimentation before Victor finally regained its dominance in 1928 . Last year Victor paid dividends of $1.25 on 621,000 shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , the company made a profit of $342,500 . <P> A heavyset , silver-haired , pleasant man of 65 whose hobbies are golf and a $100,000 collection of French and Dutch oils , August Kochs , with typical German thrift , has always financed Victor expansion out of earnings . At present he contemplates a $1,000,000 plant with electric furnaces near Mount Pleasant , Tenn. , for which the company has signed a $500,000-a-year power contract with TVA . This hefty expansion could be swung by private financing , but August Kochs has lately been pestered by stockholders who want a market valuation for their stock . Therefore last week Victor Chemical Works offered a public sale of 150,000 shares , planned to seek listing on the New York Stock Exchange . Half the stock represents new financing , half was acquired from a group of stockholders . Price : $19 per share .
