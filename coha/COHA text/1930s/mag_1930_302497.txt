A little before Christmas one Benjamin Minturn of Chicago heard that , because of lagging stamp sales , the post office at Florence , Kan. , his home town , would be reduced to third class , and that his old schoolmate , Postmaster Shamus O'Brien , might have his salary cut . To Schoolmate O'Brien he sent $1,000 for stamps , to make Florence seem like more of a post office ( TIME , Dec. 30 ) . Last week this kind deed was nullified . Postmaster O'Brien was informed from Washington that the $1,000 order would not count in his year 's business . Postmasters were warned that those who induce stamp purchases " for the purpose of increasing their pay or affecting the allowance of facilities at their office " were open to suspicion .
