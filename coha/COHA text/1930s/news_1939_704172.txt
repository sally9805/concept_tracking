txt Immediate abandonment of the Anglo-Polish alliance is among the so-called " minimum demands " that Chancellor Hitler made to Sir Nevile Henderson , the British Ambassador , it became known tonight . Herr Hitler also demanded the unconditional return of Danzig to Germany and a " corridor " across Pomorze , the Polish Corridor . He told the Ambassador that unless all three of these were conceded in advance he would not negotiate on " other matters " with the Poles or with any one else . Sir Nevile is expected to return to Berlin tomorrow with the British Government 's reply , which will amount to rejection , but may at the same time try to keep the door open to negotiations . Whether this can be done by asking for " clarification " or by proposing an alternative plan is a question that the Ministers themselves had not final ? ly decided tonight . The Cabinet met for two and a half hours this evening after the Ambassador had reported to Prime Minister Chamberlain and King George on his long interview with Herr Hitler yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blunt and uncompromising rejection , for this was the mood of the government throughout a day of mounting tension on the Continent . Revision Demanded by One Nevertheless , at least one powerful Minister whose name has been associated with the " appeasers " of ilast year is said to have objected that the draft was too strong . So an attempt was being made tonight to draft a reply in more legalistic ) and conciliatory terms in the hope of avoiding anything that would bang the door irrevocably or enable the Germans to blame Britain for a new world war if it should come . Another meeting of the Cabinet has been summoned for 10:30 tomorrow morning , and Sir Nevile presumably will await the outcome before returning with his message to Herr Hitler . The full report that the Ambassador brought back from Germany this morning showed Herr Hitler to have been in his most truculent mood and manner in his talk with Sir Nevile yesterday . Par from being an " interview , " it was more of a violent and abusive monologue . It is true that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a torrent of an hour and a quarter of angry rhetoric , all of which Sir Nevile dutifully reported to his superiors today . Herr Hitler began it , according to the British version , with a diatribe against Poland . He said it was impossible to have neighborly relations with a country that was " martyrizing " its Germans and was bent on war . He was contemptuous of Poland 's " sovereign rights " and talked menacingly of what Germany and Russia together could do to Poland if they were driven to it . Losing Patience , He Repeats The Chancellor also said once more that his patience was being exhaust ? ed and he denounced Britain for her part in encouraging the Poles . Britain has no business in Eastern Europe anyway , he cried . Thereupon he announced that if he did not " settle accounts " with the Poles by arms he must have Danzig unconditionally and also the " corridor across the Corridor " that he had demanded in his Reichstag speech last April . There are other questions that might be negotiated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible until " conditions for confidence " are present . The greatest obstacle to confidence is the Anglo-Polish alliance , he told the Ambassador , and this led him to demand that the alliance  --  formally signed only Thursday night In London  --  must be abrogated as a prerequisite to negotiation . Whether the Ambassador man- aged to interrupt this monologue is not clear from British accounts of the interview . Official quarters here bitterly denied reports from Berlin that the Ambassador had expressed willingness to concede Danzig or that he had given any indication of British support for such a " settlement . " Nevertheless , the political correspondent of The Sunday Times will say tomorrow that both Danzig and the Corridor " are negotiable questions if an acceptable basis for a conference could be found . " It remains to be seen after tomorrow 's Cabinet meeting whether there has really been any weakening of the British attitude or whether these hints of a new " appeasement " to avert war are only the work of one or two Ministers in Mr. Chamberlain 's official family . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quibble are those of Sir John Simon , Chancellor of the Exchequer , and young Richard Austen Butler , Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs , who is not a member of the Cabinet but was invited to join the discussion around the Cabinet table . Their argument against a harsh reply to Herr Hitler is reported to have been that Britain must have an absolutely clear case in the eyes of the world if she goes into a war and that she  --  must show once more her willingness to discuss any " legitimate " grievances around a conference table . As for " selling out " the Poles by putting pressure on them to give up Danzig and the Corridor , there was still no sign that the British Government would repeat its tactics of last year in the case of Czecho-Slovakia despite reports from Berlin that another Munich was imminent . The overwhelming majority of the Cabinet is believed to be as firm as ' the French , who simply replied to Herr Hitler tonight that any German demands must be put up to Poland as the sole judge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributed to Sir John Simon that there was even talk in London tonight  --  perhaps wishful , perhaps truthful  --  that Sir John would resign if the draft of tomorrow 's reply were not watered down to meet his views . Once before , in the midst of the World War , he resigned from the government ; then it was because he could not accept the principle of conscription . Moreover , there is a tremendous pressure of opinion upon Mr. Chamberlain for 100 per cent firmness . The general staff is said to have urged that if war must come it would be preferable now rather than a year from now . At least now the Polish Army is in existence and Britain has other allies in Eastern Europe that might create a war on two fronts ; a year from now the Eastern allies might have vanished and Germany might have been strengthened by huge stocks of raw materials from Russia 's inexhaustible supplies . Not only the fighting services but the government departments are in a more warlike mood than one has ever known them to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Corridor go to Germany the stage will be set for another " March 15 " ? another invasion and annihilation like the conquest of Czecho-Slovakia five months ago . But there is still another argument heard in favor of firmness , and it may yet be echoed in the British reply tomorrow . It is that Herr Hitler has not yet made up his mind to plunge into a new world war , no matter what he may have told the British Ambassador yesterday . The Ambassador 's report gave the impression that Herr Hitler was trying to frighten the British and the Poles into surrender to get his way . Yet the dread signal has not been given . An ultimatum to Poland was predicted for last Thursday , but it did not come ; it was predicted again for yesterday , but the Fuehrer did not speak ; it was looked for in his Tannenberg speech scheduled for tomorrow , but the ceremony on the old battlefield was canceled . The French , at least , are convinced that firmness can yet win the day and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allies .
