txt A severe electrical storm , accompanying one of the heaviest downpours of the year , drenched the Chicago area last night and early this morning , first striking Waukegan , then moving southward through the northern suburbs until It engulfed the city Itself . The north and west sides of the city were hardest hit . The street drainage system was unable to take care of the sudden storm waters and streets ran a foot deep with the flood . Automobiles were stalled and firemen were busy with calls to pump out flooded basements . Lightning struck the home of Frederick Phillips , 1009 North Mansfield avenue , and knocked plastering trom the ceiling , but did little damage . A bolt also struck and partially destroyed the cross on the Sacred Heart Catholic church in Winnetka . The rain first struck Waukegan about 4 p. m. , flooding streets and basements . In Glencoe and Highland Park trees were splintered by lightning and telephone and light wires blown down . Evanston firemen were also called out when wires were torn down in that suburb .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
