txt Maturities of city securities aggregating $16,000,000 which fall due on Monday were the subject of a conference at City Hall yesterday attended by Mayor O'Brien , members of the Board of Estimate and representatives of the banks that have been lending the city money . Called at the insistence of Controller Berry , who wanted each Board of Estimate member to hear what the bankers had to say , the conference occupied itself solely with the problem of meeting the next maturity . Those present began on the assumption that an extension would be required , either directly or by refinancing that would allow the city to pay off that debt by contracting a new one at the same time . Though the city has $135,000,000 to meet on June 10 , that maturity was not discussed . One banker said that the financial group would have enough to do to consider one problem at a time . In addition to the Mayor , those at the conference were Winthrop W. Aldrich , chairman of the Chase National pank ; Thomas W. Lamont of J. P. Morgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of banks ; Controller Berry , Deputy Controller Frank J. Prial , Duncan Maclnnes , chief accountant of the Finance Department ; William Reid Jr. , City Collector ; Borough Presidents George U. Harvey of Queens , John A. Lynch of Richmond and Henry Hesterberg of Brooklyn ; Welfare Commissioner Frank J. Taylor , William J. Flynn , Public Works Commissioner of the Bronx ; John Halleran , Public Works Commissioner of Queens , and David S. Rendt , Public Works Commissioner of Richmond . Bankers Wilting to Extend . The bankers told the Board of Estimate members that they were willing to grant an extension on the city securities held by banks . They pointed out , however , that about $4,000,000 of the $16,000,000 maturing next week is held by private investors . Whether these investors will grant similar extensions remained an open question . A bank representative said that the difficulty of obtaining extensions from private holders increased each time it was tried . He added that he was confident some way would be found to meet the situation when it arises . In discussing the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $60,000,000 a year , the bankers called attention to the fact that relief money refunded by the State was placed in the city 's general fund for reduction of taxation . While they made no specific request regarding this money , the bankers indicated their belief that it would be better financing to hold the returns from the State against the necessity of future relief funds . Under the present system the city must borrow new money every month for relief . The city still faces the problem of obtaining $5,000,000 this month for unemployment relief during May . If the $16,000,000 maturing next week is renewed the bankers said the city could find the required $5,000,000 in the $16,000,000 . Prefer Further Economy . While the bankers expressed some satisfaction over the city 's budget economies , they left the impression that there was plenty of room for further saving . They were inclined to the belief that the city could put its financial house in order by cutting expenses rather than by seeking new revenues . After the conference , which lasted for almost two hours , Mayor O'Brien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City Hall . Asked what had gone on behind the closed doors , he said : " We discussed city finances . " " Was any decision made on them ? " " I wo n't say whether there was or not , " the Mayor replied judiciously . " We have a pretty clear understanding . We discussed the whole thing , prospective and retrospective . " " Did you get the relief money needed for May ? " " Come on out and look at the parade . " he replied . The Mayor said he had pointed out to the bankers that tax arrears collected in the last few days to- taled $5,000,000 more than for the same period last year . Tax collections up to May 8 , he said , were 8 per cent of the total levy , against 4.13 per cent this year in 1932 , 4.26 per cent in 1931 and 3.55 per cent in 1930 . The Mayor did not explain that the 8 per cent this year was composed of 4.90 per cent in taxes collected in advance through the sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent represented taxes collected in the usual way . Berry Plan Not Discussed . Before he left the City Hall last night Mayor O'Brien touched on the conference once more . " As a result of the conference there is a better understanding between the banking interests and the city , " he said . " We look for a full cooperation from them , as they do from us . I do not believe another conference will be necessary . After there is a start in employment through the projects which will be started , and when employment becomes widespread , the relief needs of the city will be greatly reduced . There was no discussion of the Berry report . The bankers spoke from their point of view and we from ours . There was a general expression that the bankers wanted to be helpful to the city . and they seemed to realize the full measure of the economies thus far accomplished .

Deficiencies in the current city budget and mandatory increases next year will raise the 1934 budget by $40,000,000 over that for 1933 , Harold Riegelman , counsel of the Citizens Budget Commission , said yesterday . He spoke before the Uptown Chamber of Commerce in the Hotel Theresa . He attacked the city administration for its haphazard methods in launching public improvements without knowing where the money was coming from to finish them . Items that would make up the $40,000,000 budget increase next year , he said , included $10,500,000 deficiency in State aid for education ; Board of Transportation expenses , $4,500,000 ; pension and retirement funds , $6,850,000 , and mandatory salary increases for police , fire and educational employes , $2 , - 040,000 .
