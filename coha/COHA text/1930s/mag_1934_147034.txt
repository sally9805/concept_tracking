The rough , nickel-loded , forest-fuzzed Canadian frontier at the east end of Lake Nipissing bulged large with spring 's fertility last week . The full moon with Venus , Mars and Saturn accompanying swelled pompously across the midnight sky . And in a lamplit farmhouse near Callander a buxom French-Canadian woman of 24 whimpered with the unusual fullness of her womb . She , too , had three attendants-her aunt , another goodwife who had borne 17 children , and her husband Ovila Dionne . Upstairs in bed were the two boys and three girls of the Dionnes . Four years in his grave lay their sixth child . <P> Toward 4 a. m. things began popping in the uncarpeted downstairs bedroom where Elzire Dionne lay . " a me fait mal , " she wept . Ovila Dionne surmised that his wife was complaining about the swelling of her legs . But the goodwives knew that Elzire Dionne was on the verge of bearing her seventh child , perhaps twins . They dispatched Ovila down the rocky , forest-edged road to Dr. Dafoe 's , placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean towels and a bottle of olive oil on the new bedroom bureau , lined a wicker clothesbasket with pads and sheets to receive the newcomer , washed their hands , and composed themselves to watch a labor which no one expected for at least another month . <P> Dr. Allan Roy Dafoe. a stocky little grey-haired practitioner who has delivered some 1,500 children in frontier Ontario , leaped nimbly into his clothes when Ovila timidly rapped at the door . In the doctor 's Dodge they drove back to the Dionne house . <P> A premature baby girl was there ahead of them , and another was on the way before the doctor could remove his coat , roll up his sleeves and wash his hands . Like a football quarterback , Dr. Dafoe passed another girl to the dumbfounded goodwives and another and another and another . " Mon Dieu , mon Dieu , " sniffled Papa Dionne , fetching and pouring hot water . Fearing that none of the 9-in. , 8-mo. mites would live long enough for a priest to arrive , he baptized each one himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth of the fifth girl , who completed the 31st authentically known quintuplet in 500 years , Mrs. Elzire Dionne fainted . It all had taken place in 30 minutes . <P> Ovila Dionne wept : " I am ashamed of myself . " <P> He fetched a potato scales and weighed the lot in the clothesbasket : 13 Ib. 6 oz . The Dionne roosters were crowing for dawn while Dr. Dafoe washed up , eased his suspenders , donned his coat and drove back to his wifeless , book-filled home . He needed a little sleep , for later that day he expected another confinement . <P> En route he stopped at Father Daniel Routhier 's . Father Routhier hurried over to sprinkle and cross the quintuplets officially for God . <P> Only God knew who was who and who was first in the clothesbasket . In the bustle of delivery Dr. Dafoe 's helpers had misarranged the girls . Few days later , after Mrs. Dionne regained energy enough to think , she picked the names Cecile , Yvonne , Marie , Emily , Annette . A trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
