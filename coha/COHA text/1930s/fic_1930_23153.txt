A RESIDENT OF PURGATORY A STORY BY THOMAS BOYD I N all Reno there was no more popu- lar haven for discontented wives than Mrs. Green 's furnished apartment building  --  and no more discontented wife than young Mrs. Green herself . Lilia Green 's **27;123;TOOLONG cubicles were neither more convenient nor less expensive than those at the Golden View or at the Brookside . Their exceptional popularity was mainly due to her sympathetic interest in other people 's troubles . With glistening brown hair , a spot of rouge on each cheek , and dark eyes full of solicitude , Lilia sat on the arm of the chintz-covered sofa in apartment number one and listened to large Mrs. Ledyard 's woeful account of the married life from which she was escaping by way of Nevada 's peculiarly liberal divorce laws . " It 's such a comfort to talk to you  --  you 're so understanding . But you simply ca n't imagine what I 've put up with for years ! " Mrs. Ledyard tragically concluded . " I know . " Lilia nodded compassionately . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During her many months as mistress of the Green Apartments she had heard more than a hundred variations on it , each from a different tenant  --  young , old , and middle-aged , homely and pretty , pitiful and defiant . Added to that was her own recent and bitter appraisal of Bert and the possibility of a happier life which Kirk was offering her . She had been married to Bert for twelve years . Even since his decree and swore he would wait no longer . With Bert there would be no trouble like that Mrs. Ledyard feared from her husband . There was nothing Bert could do to stop her once she started . She was already a resident of Nevada , and Attorney Will Sibley could get her a divorce on the grounds of non-support without the slightest trouble . Within ten days after filing her complaint , which she meant to see about at once , Judge Tanner or Judge Lacey would hand her the decree , and on that same day she and Kirk could be married and on their way to his tobacco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ledyard , " she repeated , adding , " like Clyde , the entertainer out at the Buckaroo , sings of Judge Lacey and the girls : He thinks he 's giving them e-man-ei-pation , But all he does is to put ' em back in cir-eu-Ia-tion . ' " Lilia laughed and looked expectantly at Mrs. Ledyard . It was a line that seldom failed to divert her distracted tenants , but Mrs. Ledyard pronounced a solemn " very amusing " and leaned over to turn on her rented radio . As the sound came forth from the San Francisco broadcasting station she picked up an empty highball glass and walked heavily toward the kitchenette . " You 'll see about getting more heat in the apartment , wo n't you , Mrs. Green ? " Lilia had stopped in that morning because Mrs. Ledyard had been cold and had complained of it . At the remembrance her disgust with Bert was increased . Though his chief job in winter was to keep the furnace stoked from six at night till nine in the morning , he had , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had not been down to touch it since . Promising Mrs. Ledyard more warmth for her apartment , Lilia went out in the hall where Katie , the swarthy , flat-faced Indian girl , was lazily polishing the banister . Katie looked at her with brown , completely uninterested eyes and said , " Mist ' Green he say tell you he gone downtown . " Lilia muttered angrily to herself , " If that 's not just like him ! And on Monday morning , too ! " Bert knew she had two cases coming up in court at ten o'clock and had to be there punctually . Yet he had gone out , leaving the building to her care entirely . It was now after nine and she had n't finished dressing ; she had promised to run up and see Kirk , but she no longer had time for anything except to get ready for court . In spite of her hurry she dressed with leisure and care . She had intended to see Kirk , but he would be there after lunch , too . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddle-soaping his boots while he waited for her to come . Poor Kirk , she thought ; he had had a lonely time of it since September when he had arrived to start legal proceedings against a wife who had deserted but would not divorce him . He had looked so restless and unhappy in Reno that she had felt pity for him from the beginning . But their intimacy had begun on the day Bert stopped mowing the lawn because of a crick in his back . For Kirk , to have something to do , had taken up the machine where her husband had left it and had laboriously continued until all the yard was neatly clipped . She had gone out to thank him , had stayed to talk . Some people , they had decided , were energetic ? like themselves . Others were shiftless , they had agreed  --  it was implied but obvious on whom each based the conclusion . They parted with mutual esteem . She admired his strength and his dependability and was sorry for his loneliness in Reno . He grew emotionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an apartment house after her husband had failed in business and successfully carrying it on without his assistance . Each time they met it was with keener feelings for each other until now it seemed as if the only possible life for either of them was with each other . Lila finished dressing for court . When she reappeared in the hail it was as if she had clothed herself for a holiday . Her nails were glistening with liquid polish , her lips were red and smiling . She wore a smart black hat and a black coat with a large fur collar . It was a costume as carefully considered as that of the leading woman in a Broadway play . Lilia smiled at herself with approval . Though she was only to appear as witness that two of her tenants had lived in Reno for fully three months  --  which entitled them to the benefit of Nevada 's favorable divorce laws  --  and though it was a regular weekly occurrence , Mondays in court to her were more important than a holiday . From the Green Apartments it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on South Virginia Street , but Lilia , as usual , traveled the distance in her sedan . Parking before the square , white , pseudo-classic building , she got out and cheerily climbed to the second floor . Entering the bated , tensely expectant atmosphere of the court chambers , she received familiar but respectful nods and whispers from half a dozen lawyers , several divorce plaintiffs , the court reporter , and also the clerk . As she walked down between the front bench and the railed enclosure she had an agreeable suspicion that most of the strangers to the court were noticing her as a person of consequence . It was ten o'clock , but the first ease had not yet been called because Judge Lacey was in his private room finishing his cigar as Lilia , who knew his habits , could see through an opening in the doorway to the left of the judicial bench . Everyone else , however , was there . The lawyers were waiting casually with their brief cases , Attorney Will Sibley among them  --  but it was no time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaintiffs sat in positions too studiously careless , the onlookers exchanged hushed gossip among themselves . Joining one of her divorcee tenants , Lilia sat down and began tolook around . Down at the farther end of the front bench beside one of the women for whom she had come to testify , she noticed old Mrs. Gowdy , who owned the Riverview Apartments , and behind her ' fish Nagel of the Summit Ridge Apartments . Presently Judge Larey , completely bald , with a narrow jaw and empty , round blue eyes , came in . The gavel rapped , the people stood , there was a shuffling of feet , the court sat , then silence . Lilia , watched attentively , but her interest in the scene was really centered on the part which she herself was to play . As Judge Lacey opened the heavy book on his desk and read , " Case number H-994832a ! Are you ready ? " Lilia observed old Mrs. Gowdy , with corseted hips , waddle forth beside a girl in a cheap red hat and rabbit-fur collar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gowdy take more pride in her appearance on a day like this ? And why did she always fumble and mumble over taking the oath ? Sitting awkwardly in her chair beneath the judge 's desk , her knees apart , and the toes of her unpolished shoes turned out , she replied to the lawyer 's questions as if she had never been to court before in her life . A disgrace to Reno , Lilia thought impatiently . Case number II-994632a was begun at 10:10 . At exactly 10:18 the attorney for the girl in the cheap red hat and rabbit-fur collar was mechanically congratulating her at the doorway while Judge Lacey arose and called out , " Case number H-994633a ! " That was Lilia 's cue . And when Attorney Will Sibley nodded to her she turned to the pale , rather nervous looking woman beside her and whispered reassuringly , " You 'll be all right , dearie ; all you have to do is to keep saying yes : , 1 With the assurance of the expert Lilia stepped briskly through the railed enclosure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk , and crossed over to the chair beneath the judge 's bench , where she sat with one knee over the other and small head alertly tilted forward . Attorney Will Sibley , with a sheaf of papers in his hand , looked at her and , after establishing the fact of her own residence before the court , asked in a businesslike tone , " Are you acquainted with the plaintiff , Mrs. Green ? " Lilia answered promptly , " I am . " " How long have you known her ? " " Since September first , " replied Lilia briefly . " You have seen the plaintiff every day since September first ? " " Every day , " affirmed Lilia . Judge Lacey nodded from the bench , Will Sibley bowed and smiled . " Thank you , Mrs. Green . That is all . " Satisfied that she had made her usual good impression , Lilia went through the court and down the hall into Judge Tanner 's chambers where she repeated the same formality for Mrs. Bingham , her other tenant who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solemnity of a private hearing , an extra attention for which her more affluent clients were glad to pay . And this morning in particular , after Judge Tanner had said , " Well , you 're looking pretty smart to-day , are n't you , Mrs. Green ? " she felt as if her place in Reno , even with Bert as a husband , was a distinguished and satisfactory one . But when she returned home that morning and , going through the hall in which the noise of the incessant radio from number three could be heard , found Bert comfortably smoking a cigar in the sunlight of the big bay window of the apartment , her discontent flared again into lively activity . She said accusingly , as she stood in the doorway , the big fur collar of her coat thrown back , " Well , Bert . Green ! Where have you been ? " Bert was sleek and nearly forty , with eyes drawn in from life , and a jaw that slid back and forth when he talked . " I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He looked at herwith sleepy insolence over the end of his cigar . " Yes , " said Lila tapping her foot , " and what about the furnace this morning ? What about the garbage that 's still in the hail upstairs ? " Bert tilted his head on one side and delicately crooked the little finger of the hand in which he held his cigar . " Well , what about the garbage ? It 's been emptied , ai n't it ? " He had collected it after he had come back from the hotel . " I guess you better take another look . " " A fine time to take care of it , " said Lilia sarcastically . The glowing self-appreciation she had felt in the court room had been thoroughly dissipated by the inadequacy of Bert , and in its place lay her usual dull resentment . Hanging her new coat in the closet she went out to the kitchenette and set the kettle on the electric range . But as she slowly slipped her rubber apron over her foulard dress her dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a man who sat about the house all day and did nothing ? Why should she continue to live with a husband like that when , up on the third floor , Kirk was waiting , offering the love , the sympathy and admiration which she needed and which she had only to lift her hand to possess ? With a sudden spurt of fury she banged the saucepan against the sink , jerked off her apron , and marched into the living room where she turned on the radio . Bert asked casually over his cigar , " Ravin ' a tantrum , Lil ? ' She was furious , but the thought of the escape Kirk offered made her smile at him with scorn . Bert turned again toward the sunlight , the unclouded blue sky , and the tawny , irregular ridge of the ribbed Sierras . Half an hour passed in silence , save for the incongruous sound of jazz from the radio . Finally Bert looked around . " Lil , " he said , " ai n't it pretty near time for dinner ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , with her eyes on the Sunday feature section of the newspaper , she answered disinterestedly , " If you want lunch you can get it yourself . " " All right , by God , " he announced decisively , " I will ! " Jerking his feet down from the radiator , he stalked into the kitchen and began rattling pots and pans . Bitterly amused , Lilia waited . Even before the apartment was filled with the smell of burning rice she knew what the outcome of Bert 's activity would be . " Just what I thought would happen , " she taunted as he came angrily into the room . Bert glared at her and went to the closet for his hat . " You know a hell of a lot , " he said sarcastically . She knew where he was going : down to the hotel for lunch  --  which he would pay for with her money . " I wish I did know a hell of a lot , " she mimicked him furiously , " because then maybe I 'd know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yeh ? " He swung round toward her . " Lemme tell you something , Lil . You did n't do any wonderin ' when you were back of the hardware counter in Woolworth 's , and I was dickerin ' to set up in business for myself ! You made so big a grab for me that everybody in town could see it ! " " You ! " she advanced upon him with hot scorn in her voice . " You ! Well , thank heavens I do n't have to stay married to you ! " He was close and menacing . " Is that a fact ? Well , now just lemme tell you something else . You watch your step -- -see ! " She stood her ground , demanding fiercely , " What do you mean ? How dare you threaten me ! " " Listen ! " ? it was Bert 's turn to be scornful ? " what 's that guy up in number twelve staying on here for when he 's had his decree for the last three weeks ? " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a lucky guess ; Bert had never seen her and Kirk together . With a cold smile that ad-mitted nothing but her distaste for her husband she answered , " He swore in court he came out here to make Nevada his permanent home , did n't he ? Maybe that 's the reason he 's staying . " " Do n't hand me none of that old stuff . Everybody has to swear to that because it 's the law and they would n't get their divorces if they did n't . " Bert put on his hat and went to the door . With his hand on the knob he said again , " You watch your step , Lil . If I catch you and that big hulk together I 'll go after you . go after you so hard you 'll both wish you were never born . " He went out , jerking the door shut behind him . Lilia 's expression of defiance needed no strengthening by words . Bert 's threat , she knew , was meant to warn her no less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his character which might easily provoke him to insane violence if it were aroused . But she was not afraid . Standing there after he had gone out , feeling the pulse of anger throbbing in her temples , she thought of Kirk and would have rushed to his room at once , except for the trivial fact that he had probably not returned from lunch . Above the music from the still insistent radio the buzzer whirred . Probably , Lilia thought , it was one of her tenants wanting something done that Bert had Ieft undone . Assuming her customary solicitous smile , she went to answer it . " Oh , Mrs. Green ! " It was young Mrs. Jaffrey , the pale , nervous looking woman for whom Lilia had testified in court that morning . But Mrs. Jaffrey was not pale and nervous looking now , for she had received her decree of absolute divorce , also several hundred dollars a month alimony , and she had already begun to celebrate with highballs before lunch . " Oh , Mrs. Green , you 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and have a cocktail with us to-night ? It 's my graduating party , you know . " Lilia was pleased but hesitant .. " Why I 'd love to ? " She was thinking of Kirk , for she had intended to be with him that evening . Mrs. Jaffrey noticed her uncertainty , but ascribed a different cause to it . " And Mr. Green too , of course  --  if he wants to come . " It was plain she hoped he would n't . " Oh , no , no , " said Lilia hastily . " It 's his lodge night . He never misses Monday . " Mrs. Jaffrey was relieved . Impulsively she enlarged her invitation . " I 'm having just a few friends in , but later we might all go out to the Buckaroo . And perhaps I could ask Mr. Howland , that man on the third floor , to go along . " Lilia 's eyes shone at this lucky shaping of events . " I 'm sure he 'd  --  I mean , I think it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Jaffrey turned to go a moment later , Lilia followed her down to the end of the hall and went upstairs to see if Kirk had come back from lunch . At his door she tapped lightly and , still smiling , stood leaning forward eagerly as she heard his heavy , awkward steps come toward her . Kirk was raw bcaled and over six feet tall . Holding a sponge and a brown leather boot in his hand , he opened the door . His light , quizzical eyes regarded her with frowning intentness and he asked abruptly , dropping the boot and taking hold of her arms , " Lilia , darling , did you see that lawyer this morning ? " " No , " in her exuberance over Mrs. Jaffrey 's unexpected invitation she answered and hastily plunged ahead with what she had come to tell him , " but I 've got the most marvelous news ! I 've just been talking to Mrs. Jaffrey , you know that girl in number seven . She 's giving a graduating party and she 's asking us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Buckaroo ! Is n't that great ? " Kirk looked at her dubiously . " I do n't like that Buckaroo , Lilia . They put glycerin in the corn whisky , and I 'll swear they 've got their gin scented just like perfume . It 's all right for these high-steppin ' divorcees with lots of money to throw away on that roulette wheel of theirs , but I do n't favor it myself . " He stopped and looked at her earnestly . " Ca n't we just go somewhere by ourselves ? " Lilia frowned disappointedly and answered with native pride , " It 's as good a night club as there is in North Carolina , is n't it ? " Kirk laughed . " Honey , it 's got to be . Because I 've never seen a night club from one end of the state to the other . But if you want to go out there , we 'll go . " She looked up at him . " Kirk , you 're a darling , you know it ? " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be if you say so . And when I get you back to North Carolina , Lilia ? " She stiffened a little . " Kirk , I 've got to tell you something . Bert knows about us and he 's threatened I do n't know what if he finds us together ! " Kirk instead of showing consternation looked toward the hall door with an expression of steadfast pleasure . " That 's all right , Lilia . If a woman 's not worth fightin ' for she 's not worth havin ' . I 'll just go down and hold a little talk with him . " He moved as if to go at once . Lilia stood in front of him . " No , I wo n't let you do that . I can take care of myself and I do n't want to be fought over . " Kirk stopped , puzzled . " You sure that 's the reason you wo n't let me go down ? " " Why , of course it is , " said Lila decidedly . But Kirk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hankerin ' after that husband of yours and do n't know it ? " He looked worriedly at her . " Bert ? " Lilia laughed  --  it was so ridiculous ? " Kirk , that 's the craziest thing you ever said . " " All right . " Kirk stopped obediently . " But once you 've got your decree I wo n't stand for threats from anybody . And look here , " he broke off suddenly and grasped her shoulders , " we 're not going to stay here any longer , either . I 've already been in this town nearly four whole months and I want to get back to God 's own country with you . I 've had enough of purgatory . " Lilia demanded , " What do you mean , purgatory ' ? " It was not a question , but a defensive challenge . " That 's what it is , " said Kirk . " Plain purgatory . And we ca n't wait around any longer . I 'm tired of sitting here with nothing to do but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sagebrush with the rattlesnakes . " Lilia met his earnestly demanding eyes . Kirk was hurt because she had not yet had Will Sibley file her complaint . But whenever she had seen the attorney he had been in court , and then both their minds had been concentrated on their jobs in Reno 's leading industry . " I 'll do it , Kirk . Honest , I will . " " When ? " he insisted . On his tobacco farm in the Piedmont there were drying sheds and cabins that needed repairs , markets to be looked after , and old ground to be fertilized . " Soon , " she promised . " The first thing to-morrow morning . " Kirk 's lengthened face widened beatifically . " Gosh , Lilia ! I hope that makes you as happy as it does me ! " He caught her up exultantly , and for a moment the world Kirk offered her became so real in her mind that she could almost smell the pine trees and see the broad , white-columned house about which he was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Buckaroo and of all she had to do before evening made her pull away . With a hurried " Got to run now  --  see you to-night " she was gone . Past the rows of apartments with their rented radios turned on and their glass doors which only half concealed the movements of their restless , disillusioned tenants , Lilia went hurriedly . Kirk loved her , adored her , and she knew it . Not even the burnt rice in the saucepan which Bert had left and which Katie , the lazy Indian girl , had failed to empty , could disturb her lightheartedness . Bert was nothing , no more in her life than a chance puddle on a sidewalk which might deflect her course by a few steps only . But Kirk was everything ; Kirk was love and admiration and dependability . Early that evening she began to dress . Bert came in as she was finishing . He looked moodily at her from beneath his eyebrows . " What 's the idea of getting all dolled up like that ? " Lilia , smoothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the closet door , slowly turned her head , and answered imperturbably , " What business is that of yours ? " Bert glared at her . " If you 're step-pin ' out with that big hulk in number twelve ? " he began . Ignoring him , Lilia patted a wave in the side of her hair . " I 'm going out with Mrs. Jaffrey , " she said ; " please get out of my way . " Bert stepped aside , and she went through the hall to Mrs. Jaffrey 's apartment . It was still early , but everybody who had been asked was there when she arrived . Usually the women outnumbered the men by a ratio of three to one , but to-night there were enough of the less represented sex to go around . Otherwise it was a typical Reno gathering . On the linen-covered sofa sat Jed Grey , a fifty-year-old lawyer whose interest in divorcees was not restricted to their legal troubles ; Gigolo Johnston , dark , slick , and pale , who had never disproved the charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle-aged , gullible woman who had come to Reno for a divorce ; Ethel Powers , a shrewd looking thirty-year-old blonde , and a younger , softer-faced girl who had recently arrived from Long Island . Kirk , bored and lonely , was standing in a corner , talking to Mr. Disney , who worked for a local borax mine . And Mrs. Jaffrey , in high-heeled slippers and a flimsy chiffon dress , was at the telephone calling her bootlegger for more corn whisky and gin . Meanwhile the radio was going in the living room , a portable phonograph was playing in the kitchenette , and everybody was holding a cocktail glass and talking between drinks . Lilia slipped into the slightly hysterical gaiety as if she had been born to that hectic atmosphere . She smiled , gave her hand , accepted a cocktail , took a lighted cigarette and a caviar biscuit with the ease of a practiced debutante . Over the rim of the frosted green glass her eyes encountered Kirk and she went toward him quickly , but Jed Grey , the lawyer , called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of vacancies now , Mrs. Green . I saw two or three of your girls in court this morning . " Lilia laughed . " Only one just now . Mrs. Bingham got Judge Tanner to hurry her case through so she could take the Overland Limited . " Mrs. Jaffrey came up . " You 'll have another one to-morrow , because I 'm taking the same train in the morning . " Jed Grey boomed , " Well , good luck to you and do n't forget you had a grand time out here , little lady ! " He got up heavily and , smiling at his own obesity , walked toward Lilia . " I 've got a couple of clients coming in on the eleven o'clock from the East . They 're highly recommended . I 'll send them up to you . " " Thanks , " Lilia said gratefully . Kirk , she was aware , had become acutely interested in her answer , and she looked at him , imploringly apologetic , as if to say that her reply to Jed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Come and help me mix up another shaker of cocktails ; we 've got time for just one more round before we go out to the Buckaroo . " Kirk nodded politely and , with an anxious , regretful look at Lilia , gloomily followed his hostess into the kitchenette . " Well , " breathed Mrs. Jaffrey as Kirk hurriedly cracked a chunk of ice , " one more night and then thank heavens ! " Her eyes were bright and her face seemed set with determined excitement . Kirk grinned a little . He too , he thought , could give the same pious thanks very soon . Speaking as though he had gravely pondered his opinion he said , " The mountains are all right , the sunshine 's fine , and you could n't ask for better air ; but they ought to replant the sagebrush and give the whole damned town back to the Indians ! " He dried the beaded cocktail shaker and carried it after Mrs. Jaffrey into the hilarious-sounding living room . Lilia was standing with Gigolo Johnston . Kirk interrupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick together , we 're leaving as soon as this shaker 's emptied . " Her eyes glistening , Lilia laid her hand caressingly on the lapel of his coat . " I would n't ride out there with anybody but you , not if they dragged me ! " Mrs. Jaffrey was putting on her evening wrap . Jed Grey was buttoning his light checked overcoat . Outside , the cars stood waiting at the curb , the hostess ' long , curtained roadster which , according to Reno custom , she had bought on the installment plan and was now unable to dispose of except at the loss of her equity ; Gigolo Johnston 's dented , dusty touring car , and the Iawyer 's shining sedan . With his arm around Lilia in the rumble seat of Mrs. Jaffrey 's roadster , Kirk crowded his long legs into a space meant for a much shorter man and pulled the robe up around Lilia 's chin . It was what he had been waiting for all evening ; at last he felt comfortable and secure . Soon , Lilia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the same inner warmth and coziness which now made theta defy the icy wind from the mountains as the car sped over the prairie road . " Happy , Lila ? " he asked , his lips against her ear . She gave a contented wriggle and drew closer . At the end of twelve miles over the rolling sagebrush country , with the pale moon round and high above the mountains , the swift procession of cars turned in at the Buckaroo and stopped in the gravel parking space . Mr. Disney , the first to the door , pushed the electric button and stood waiting for the tight-mouthed proprietor to scrutinize the party through the peephole before letting them in . Jed Grey bustled up and nodded familiarly at the eye . " It 's all right , " he said and the door swung open . Over soft , thick carpets , beneath pastel shaded lights they passed the coat-room , glimpsing the brass-railed mahogany bar on their way through the dance hall to the dining room . As they sat down at the large round table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amorous braying of the " Spanish Love Song , " while a dark young man with curly hair and romantic eyes moaned the accompanying words through a megaphone . Lilia beamed ecstatically . She was not often invited to the Buckaroo , and the place was as delightful to her as fairyland to a child . At a table in the corner which she faced , Attorney Will Sibley , his law partner , and their wives were sitting at dinner , while the waiter bobbed over their shoulders with a bottle of iced champagne . Sipping a dry Martini which had just been brought , she pressed her knee against Kirk 's and murmured , " Is n't it grand ? Do n't you just love it ? " " They 've got a good cook , " admitted Kirk in an undertone , " but it 'd be hell if you were n't here . " He looked about the room . There were three parties of celebrating divorcees , a few others whose cases had not yet come up , and a number of townspeople with their ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the wine , the cocktails , ' and the bizarre furnishings in the midst of the sagebrush desert gave the place a macabre gaiety that made him sad and restless . He wanted to get out and hurry Lffla to North Carolina . Between the soup and the rainbow trout they danced . Reassembling at the table , Lilia turned excitedly to Mrs. Jaffrey . " And to think Kirk called Reno purgatory ! " she exclaimed . Across the table Mrs. Jaffrey smiled understandingly at Kirk . " Why , that 's a marvelous description , " she said . " Getting out of hell and looking for heaven  --  is that what you mean ? " Kirk nodded . " It 's exactly what I mean . " To Lila he added in an undertone , " But I 've got my heaven ; right here . " " But you found it in Reno , did n't you ? " Lilia parried gaily . The next foxtrot started , and Attorney Will Sibley came over to Mrs. Jaffrey 's table . Jingling a pocketful of silver dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm delighted to see you out here . Like to try a little dance ? " Lilia stood up elatedly and with a smile at Kirk went off with him . The floor was already crowded . Most of the women were in evening dress , but there were half a dozen men in sack suits and a lone aviator in a blue jacket , whipcord breeches , and polished boots with spurs . With the orchestra playing , the colored lights flashing , the waiters passing silently over the soft carpet in the next room , it was like a motion picture scene with hastily assembled supers , but to Lilia it was the gay and infrequently glimpsed sequels to her Monday mornings in the divorce court . Jogging her about among the crowd , Will Sibley asked with friendly interest , " Well , what are you doing out here to-night ? " " Oh , " Lilia answered brightly , " I came with one of my girls . It 's marvelous , is n't it ? " " Ca n't heat it even in San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ought to come out here oftener . " " Gosh , I wish I could , " Lilia said eagerly . They danced on . Shuffling through the dancers for the third time around the floor , Will Sibley spoke to her again . " That 's a fine place you keep there at the Green Apartments . When I recommend it to a client of mine I 'm always sure she 'll be satisfied . " Lilia looked up at him with pride . " It 's awfully nice of you to say that . " The foxtrot ended , but the orchestra played an encore which they were dancing when Kirk cut in and with long legs shambling rhythmically whirled Lilia around the floor . Lilia looked up at him , her face flushed with excitement . " You did n't mind because I danced with Will Sibley , did you , Kirk ? " Kirk smiled admiringly . " You looked mighty pretty  --  what I could see of you . But I 'd have cut in long ago , only I thought maybe you 'd have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was questioning . Lilia was startled . " Heavens ! I forgot all about it , Kirk . Anyway , " she explained , " it 's better to see him in his office . " Kirk moodily agreed , " I suppose so ? " A bony hand tapped his shoulder and Mr. Disney cut in sprily . There was no chance for talking , no time for anything but enjoyment of the Buckaroo 's diversions . With Jed Grey , Mr. Disney , Gigolo Johnston , and several other men who intruded into Mrs. Jaffrey 's party , all eager to dance , Lilia was in a continuous whirl . Not till after midnight was she in Kirk 's arms again . He was wearily suggesting that they take a taxi and go home when unexpectedly the trap drum and saxophone , the piano and violin woke to a new and lively vigor . The engrossed dancers started , looked suddenly around and there , up in the middle of the waxed floor , Colonel Bowes , a leading banker of Nevada , came skipping with his arm around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His black toupee gleaming , his old checks flushed , and the coat tails flapping from his ancient full-dress suit , he cleaved a path among the people who stood delightedly aside to watch Financial Dignity at play . Lilia applauded loudly . Perhaps , she thought , Colonel Bowes would notice her in the crowd and speak . But he was too intent upon his fancy steps and the exhilarating closeness of the young divorc  --  e . And when Kirk , a moment later , led Lilia through the carpeted hall past the bar to the gambling room , she went with a backward turning of regretful eyes , like a child being taken from a circus . But almost immediately she brightened . In the gaudily colored gambling room Mrs. H. J. Bowes , the Colonel 's sister-in-law , was leaning over the roulette table , scattering red chips on the numbers as the sharp-eyed croupier spun the wheel and sped the little ball against it . Mrs. Bowes was over fifty but had rouged cheeks like Lilia 's . In a high , urgent voice she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our lucky night , " and drew bored and distracted women to buy chips and play beside her . Kirk had hoped that if he found Mrs. Jaffrey the party might break up . She was there , but already trying her luck at the table . Ethel Powers , the shrewd-faced blonde , sat in the group before the Blackjack dealer , betting with the money which Mr. Disney was plentifully supplying . Over at the crap table Attorney Will Sibley was throwing dice for a roll of bills against a stack of silver dollars . As Lilia and the reluctant Kirk came up beside him he said , " Here you are , Mrs. Green , " and handed her the dice . " Throw ' em out for me and give me luck . " Lilia played and won , lost , won again . Raking in a pile of silver dollars , Will Sibley called over his shoulder to Mrs. Bowes , " If you 're having a bad run to-night , Opal , I 'll lend you my little mascot . She 's a wonder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile , but said enthusiastically , " I certainly will take you up on that . You come right over here and stand beside me , Lilia Green ! " Pulling Kirk with her , LiIia went exultantly . At last she had got to the Buckaroo ; Attorney Will Sibley had asked her to dance , and now she was actually going to play beside Mrs. II . J. Bowes  --  sister-in-law of the Colonel himself ! Lilia giddily enumerated her triumphs . To Kirk it seemed as if the game continued for hours . Twice the croupier struck a gong and ordered free drinks for the gamblers . Finally Mrs. Jaffrey lost her last chip . As she turned from the table Mrs. Bowes asked regretfully , " You 're not going , dearie ? " Mrs. Jaffrey inspected her beaded evening bag . " Just enough for a last drink , " she explained . " Come on , Mrs. Green , I want another look at the Red Room before we leave . " The Red Room was across the hall . It had crimson hangings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . Suspended above the piano , it illuminated the broad face of Clyde , the entertainer , who sat improvising nonsense about local people as his fat fingers struck the same chords over and over again . " Lady , I kiss your little shoulder , But when I grow a little bolder ? " Through the darkened room ran a ring of hysterical giggles and a few men guffawed . Everybody was waiting for Clyde to attach a name to the verse . Gigolo Johnston preened self-consciously . " Look out I do n't sue you for libel , Clyde ! " lie called . Kirk bought a round of drinks and sat with his hands thrust deep in his pockets From somewhere a whisper started . It was carried along toward the piano . " Mrs. Green ? " Clyde nodded . " Sure , make a song about her . " Lilia grasped Kirk 's rigid arm and waited eagerly . " I kiss your little hand , Mrs. Green , Reno 's apartment house queen ? " On it went for several couplets which were neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Damned impertinence . Let 's get out of here . " Lilia flushed and hoped nobody had heard Kirk 's incomprehensible opinion . From the corner the black toupee of Colonel Bowes gleamed suddenly as he stood up and with his glass aloft announced , " To Lady Lilia Green , the best little testifier in the biggest little city in the world ! " Laughter and half-tipsy applause greeted the judicial toast . Only Kirk remained sullen and unmoved . But not even his disapproving attitude could check the high , bright flame of Lilia 's triumph . Mrs. Jaffrey took Lilies arm . " We could n't have had a better exit if we 'd planned it . " Drawing her wrap about her shoulders , she arose . Outside the sun 's bright rays were tilted up from the Sierras east of town . Drowsy even in the chill atmosphere , they drove silently back to the Green Apartments and left the car at the curb for the garage man to pick up . " Six o'clock , " yawned Mrs. Jaffrey as they went inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Lilia 's eyes were wide and bright . " I 'll wake you up , " she offered . " Thank you , my dear , but if you 'd just lend me your alarm clock ? " Lilia turned to get it . " Well , " Kirk began awkwardly . He had hoped for a chance to say good-night to Lilia atone , but he could n't outstay Mrs. Jaffrey in the hall . " Good-night , Mrs. Jaffrey . Good-night , Lilia . " He went slowly upstairs . It was eleven o'clock , and Bert had gone downtown when Lilia awoke to another day . She had just finished dressing as the door buzzer sounded and hurrying out she saw two women waiting in the hall with a pile of suitcases . They were the Mrs. Clement and her daughter from New York who had been sent to her by Jed Grey . Entering automatically into her efficient and sympathetic role , she soon had them installed in Mrs. Bingham 's apartment . Standing in the open doorway , Lilia      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
