Eaton 's Expedition Sirs : " . . . Captain William Eaton . Under his leadership and the Stars &; Stripes , the capture of Derna was made by 10 U. S. Marines , 38 Greeks and 400 Arab mercenaries " ( TIME March 22 , p. 24 ) . <P> Many " historically-minded Marines ' ' will question TIME 'S authority , if not TIME , for this statement . <P> This writer is at present at work on an original motion picture story , " First to Fight , " based in part on the U. S. war with Tripoli and the capture of Derna , and covering the period up to and including the participation of Marines , " picked men , to lead the storming of Chapultepec under Major Twiggs and Captain McDonald Reynolds , " at Mexico City in 1847 ; i.e. , " From the Halls of Montexuma to the Shores of Tripoli . " <P> During my research I have found that William Eaton was not a captain of Marines , nowhere in official records of officers attached to Commodore Treble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listed . However , he was the U. S. Consul and given special authority to execute the war . He was referred to as " General " and later was an officer in the U. S. Army . <P> TIME was right in that he was commander-in-chief of the forces which captured Derna . In addition , these forces consisted of a Colonel Leitensdorfer , a Tyrolese colonel of engineers , a medical officer ( probably Mendrici ) , Lieut . O'Bannon , U. S. Marines , Midshipman Pascal Peck , U. S. Navy , a Marine non-commissioned officer , six Marine privates , 25 cannoneers ( including three officers ) , 38 Greeks ( including two officers ) , Hamet , a friendly Arab , and 90 men , an Arabian cavalry detachment under Sheik El Tahik and about 200 footmen and camel drivers , 107 camels and a few asses . <P> CAPTAIN OWEN ERNEST JENSEN 13th Battalion . Fleet Marine Corps Reserve Los Angeles , Calif . <P> TIME did not say William Eaton was a captain of Marines . And it was not after but before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army , first as a Revolutionary volunteer , later as a regular Army captain . <P> In 1798 he was made U. S. consul at Tunis . In 1804 he became " Navy Agent to the Barbary States " and as such led his heterogeneous force from Alexandria , Egypt , through the Libyan Desert and attacked Derna from the landward side while U. S. gunboats under Commodore Samuel Barron bombarded the town from the sea . Hot of temper and loose of tongue . <P> Captain Eaton was never properly rewarded for his heroism during his lifetime , died in iSn. a disappointed man of 47. - ED . <P> LaGuardia 's Kegling Sirs : TIME , for March 22. under Sport , states in connection with the American Bowling Congress , " . . . New York 's plump little Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia bowled the first ball . It rolled ignominiously into the gutter . . . . <P> Last night I watched a newsreel in which Ed . Thorgerson was the sports spokesman . J showed New York 's Nazifoe opening the event . His Honor threw a ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to end in an eminently satisfactory strike . <P> Has LIFETIME reporting overlooked obvious ability as a Kegler of vivacious LaGuardia ? RUDOLPH H. SJOGREN Worcester , Mass . <P> Mayor LaGuardia 's ball opening the Congress knocked down one pin . With practice he later improved his form , recorded a strike for the newsreels. - ED.
