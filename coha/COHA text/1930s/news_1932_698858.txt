Dahl , chairman of the board of directors . The company nas not yet been presented 1 with the plan by which its bankers intend to meet $13,500,000 : diort term 61/2% B.-M . T. notes maturing next August I , and until arrangements are completed will not know what conditions will be imposed , but , Mr. Dahl said , in his opinion there is no question but that the notes will be paid at maturity . Mr. Dahl said it was clear that the problem now confronting the management was not one of earnings but of debt and cash position . " The earnings of the company , " he said , " are a cause for gratification considering existing conditions and the effect of those conditions on other companies . " Outside Accountants Employed After denouncing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the company 's securities . Dlr . Dahl called Said the company had employed Mies &; Mica. certified public accountants who specialized in public utility accounting , to adult the B.-M . T. books relative to the report to be issued at the close of the fiscal year ending June 30 . Heretofore the company has done Its own eaeobating:basid on flue reports of its operant* subsidiaries filed with , and audited by , the Transit Commission . It appears that outside accountants have been called in to allay any doubt as to the company 's bookkeeping practices . Abnormal market conditions are given by Mr. Dahl as the sole reason for company 's present financial situation . His complete statement follows : " Because of the recent decline in the market ' price of B.-M.T. securities , many stockholders have written me inquiring as to the cause . There has also been a great deal of newspaper corn- ' ment on the subject , and I have been deluged with inquiries from representatives of the press . Bkiniee Security Market " The present situation is due entirely to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1927 the B.-M.T. was authorized by the Transit Commission to acquire 317,000,000 of the refunding mortgage 6% sinking fund bonds , Series B of the New York Rapid Transit Corp . at 94 . These were taken up by the B.-M.T. from time to time as capital expenditures justified . The company was unable to sell the bonds to the public at the purchase price and , therefore , in 1928 the company was compelled to resort to short-term financing . At the maturity the company was compelled again to resort to shortterm financing and in 1929 sold 313,500,000 of notes secured by $16,200,000 of New York Rapid Transit Corp . 6s , the notes maturing on August 1 , 1932 . Of these $17,000,000 of bonds , the B.-M.T. owns , including those in its treasury and those as collateral for the notes maturing August 1 , the entire amount excepting 8470,000 which have been acquired by the sinking fund . " In addition the New York Rapid Transit Corp. , which is a wholly owned subsidiary , has made capital improvements and expenditures in the amount of $5,797,446 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is entitled to fund by the issuance of securities . Therefore under conditions even approximating normal the company would be in position to take care of its cash and debt requirements without causing any apprehension on the part of any of its stockholders . Two Canoes of Anxiety " Apparently there are two causes of anxiety : " First  --  Will the company be able to meet the $13,500,000 note issue due on August 1 ? " Secphd  --  What will be the conditions imposed in order to obtain such refinancing with reference to the utilization of the earnings of the company to retire the debt ? " As to the first , while arrangements have not yet been completed with the bankers , my personal belief is there is no question but what the notes will be paid at maturity . As to the second , inasmuch as the terms have not yet been agreed upon , it is impossible for anyone to give a specific and definite reply at this time . However , apprehension on the part of stockholders as to the effect of the new financing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not a Problem of Earnings " The earnings of the company are a cause for gratification considering existing conditions and the effect of those conditions on other companies . However , it must be clear that our present problem is not one of earnings but of debt and cash position . " There have been rumors circulated which have come to my attention , some of which are not only slanderous but criminal . It is impossible to go out and meet rumors and they certainly should not be dignified by a reply . "
