, stopping occasionally to investigate , he moved erratically upward until he achieved the summit of a ridge from which he had a view of miles of rugged mountains in the distance . The canyon that lay before him , separating him from the next ridge , aroused his interest . The formation of the opposite wall , he decided , would bear closer investigation . Obambi had flung himself to the ground when Smith halted . Obambi appeared exhausted . He was not . He was merely disgusted . To him the bwana was mad , quite mad . Upon no other premises could Obambi explain this senseless climbing , with an occasionalpause to examine rocks . Obambi was positivethat they might have discovered plenty of rocks at the foot of the mountains had they but searched for them . And then , too , this bwana did not hunt . He supposed all bwanas came to Africa to hunt . This one , being so different , must be mad . Smith glanced at his boy . It was too bad , he thought , to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no way in which the boy might assist him , while seeing him in a constant state of exhaustion reacted unfavorably on Smith . Better by far be alone . He turned to the boy . " Go back to camp , Obambi , " he said . " I do not need you here . " Obambi looked at him in surprise . Now he knew the bwana was very mad . However , it would be much more pleasant in camp than climbing about in these mountains . He rose to his feet . " The bwana does not need me ? " he asked . " Perhaps he will need me . " Obambi 's conscience was already troubling him . P101He knew that he should not leave his bwana alone . " No , I sha n't need you , Obambi , " Smith assured him . " You run along back to camp . I 'll come in pretty soon . " " Yes , bwana , " and Obambi turned back down the mountain side . Lafayette Smith clambered down into the canyon , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way up the opposite side that proved to be even more precipitous than it had appeared from the summit of the ridge . However , he found so much to interest him that he considered it well worth the effort , and so deeply absorbed was he that he gave no heed to the passage of time . It was not until he reached the top of the far side of the canyon that he noted the diminishing light that presaged the approach of night . Even then he was not greatly concerned ; but he realized that it would be quite dark before he could hope to recross the canyon , and it occurred to him that by following up the ridge on which he stood he could reach the head of the canyon where it joined the ridge from which he had descended into it , thus saving him a long , arduous climb and shortening the time , if not the distance , back to camp . As he trudged upward along the ridge , night fell ; but still he kept on , though now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur to him for several hours that he was hopelessly lost.  | A NEW day had dawned , and Africa greeted the age old miracle of Kudu emerging from his lair behind the eastern hills and smiled . With the exceptionof a few stragglers the creatures of the night had vanished , surrendering the world to their diurnal fellows . Tongani , the baboon , perched upon his sentinel rock , surveyed the scene and , perhaps , not without appreciation of the beauties ; for who are we to say that God touched so many countless of his works with beauty yet gave to but one of these the power of appreciation ? Below the sentinel fed the tribe of Zugash , the king ; fierce tongani shes with their balus clinging to their backs , if very young , while others played about , imitatingtheir elders in their constant search for food ; surly , vicious bulls ; old Zugash himself , the surliest and most vicious . The keen , close-set eyes of the sentinel , constantly upon the alert down wind , perceived something movingamong the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's head . Presently the whole head came into view ; and then the sentinel saw that it belonged to a tar/mangani ; but as yet he sounded no alarm , for the tarmangani was still a long way off and might not be coming in the direction of the tribe . The sentinel would watch yet a little longer and make sure , for it was senseless to interrupt the feeding of the tribe if no danger threatened . Now the tarmangani was in full view . Tongani wished that he might have the evidence of his keen nose as well as his eyes ; then there would be no doubt , for , like many animals , the tonganis preferred to submitall evidence to their sensitive nostrils before acceptingthe verdict of their eyes ; but the wind was in the wrong direction . Perhaps , too , Tongani was puzzled , for this was such a tarmangani as he had never before seen  --  a tarmangani who walked almost as naked as Tongani himself . But for the white skin he might have thought him a gomangani . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick ; and because he saw none he waited before giving the alarm . But presently he saw that the creature was coming directly toward the tribe . The tarmangani had long been aware of the presence of the baboons , being down wind from them where their strong scent was borne to his keen nostrils . Also , he had seen the sentinel at almost the same instantthat the sentinel had seen him ; yet he continued upward , swinging along in easy strides that suggested the power and savage independence of Numa , the lion . Suddenly Tongani , the baboon , sprang to his feet , uttering a sharp bark , and instantly the tribe awokep104to action , swarming up the low cliffs at the foot of which they had been feeding . Here they turned and faced the intruder , barking their defiance as they ran excitedly to and fro . When they saw that the creature was alone and bore no thunder stick they were more angry than frightened , and they scolded noisily at this interruptionof their feeding . Zugash and several of the other larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him away ; but in this they only succeeded in increasing their own anger , for the tarmangani continuedupward toward them . Zugash , the king , was now beside himself with rage . He stormed and threatened . " Go away ! " he barked . " I am Zugash . I kill ! " And now the stranger halted at the foot of the cliff and surveyed him . " I am Tarzan of the Apes , " he said . " Tarzan does not come to the stamping grounds of the tongani to kill . He comes as a friend . " Silence fell upon the tribe of Zugash ; the silence of stunning surprise . Never before had they heard either tarmangani or gomangani speak the language of the ape-people . They had never heard of Tarzan of the Apes , whose country was far to the south ; but nevertheless they were impressed by his ability to understand them and speak to them . However , he was a stranger , and so Zugash ordered him away again . " Tarzan does not wish to remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he desires only to pass them in peace . "  | " Go away ! " growled Zugash . " I kill . I am Zugash . " Tarzan swung up the cliff quite as easily as had the baboons . It was his answer to Zugash , the king . None was there who better knew the strength , the courage , the ferocity of the tongani than he , yet he knew , too , that he might be in this country for some time and that , if he were to survive , he must establishhimself definitely in the minds of all lesser creaturesas one who walked without fear and whom it was well to let alone . Barking furiously , the baboons retreated ; and Tarzan gained the summit of the cliff , where he saw that the shes and balus had scattered , many of them going farther up into the hills , while the adult bulls remained to contest the way . As Tarzan paused , just beyond the summit of the cliff , he found himself the center of a circle of snarling bulls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be helpless . To another than himselfhis position might have appeared precarious almost to the point of hopelessness ; but Tarzan knew the wild peoples of his savage world too well to expectan unprovoked attack , or a killing for the love of killing such as only man , among all the creatures of the world , habitually commits . Neither was he unaware of the danger of his position should a bull , more nervous or suspicious than his fellows , mistake Tarzan 's intentions or misinterpret some trivial act or gesture as a threat against the safety of the tribe . But he knew that only an accident might precipitate a charge and that if he gave them no cause to attack him they would gladly let him proceed upon his way unmolested . However , he had hoped to achieve friendly relations with the tongani , whose knowledge of the country and its inhabitants might prove of inestimablevalue to him . Better , too , that the tribe of Zugash be allies than enemies . And so he assayed once more to win their confidence . " Tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king baboon , " if there be many tarmangani in your country . Tarzan hunts for a bad tarmangani who has many gomangani with him . They are bad men . They kill . ' With thunder sticks they kill . They will kill the tongani . Tarzan has come to drive them from your country . " But Zugash only growled and placed the back of his head against the ground in challenge . The other males moved restlessly sideways , their shoulders high , their tails bent in crooked curves . Now some of the younger bulls rested the backs of their heads upon the ground , imitating the challenge of their king . Zugash , grimacing at Tarzan , raised and lowered his brows rapidly , exposing the white skin about his eyes . Thus did the savage old king seek to turn the heart of his antagonist to water by the frightfulness of his mien ; but Tarzan only shrugged indifferently and moved on again as though convinced that the baboons would not accept his overtures of friendship . Straight toward the challenging bulls that stood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but his eyes were narrowed and watch/ful , his every sense on the alert . One bull , stiff legged and arrogant , moved grudgingly aside ; but another stood his ground . Here , the ape-man knew the real test would come that should decide the issue . The two were close now , face to face , when suddenlythere burst from the lips of the man-beast a savage growl , and simultaneously he charged . With an answering growl and a catlike leap the baboon bounded aside ; and Tarzan passed beyond the rim of the circle , victor in the game of bluff which is played by every order of living thing sufficiently advanced in the scale of intelligence to possess an imagination . Seeing that the man-thing did not follow upward after the shes and balus , the bulls contented themselves with barking insults after him and aiming uncomplimentarygestures at his retreating figure ; but such were not the acts that menaced safety , and the apemanignored them . Purposely he had turned away from the shes and their young , with the intention of passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeming to threaten them . And thus his way took him to the edge of a shallow ravine into which , unknown either to Tarzan or the tongani , a young mother had fled with her tiny bale . Tarzan was still in full view of the tribe of Zugash , though he alone could see into the ravine , when suddenlythree things occurred that shattered the peace that seemed again descending upon the scene . A vagrant air current wafted upward from the thick verdure below him the scent of Sheeta , the panther ;  | a baboon voiced a scream of terror ; and , looking down , the ape-man saw the young she , her balu clinging to her back , fleeing upward toward him with savage Sheeta in pursuit . As Tarzan , reacting instantly to the necessity of the moment , leaped downward with back thrown spear hand , the bulls of Zugash raced forward in answer to the note of terror in the voice of the young mother . From his position above the actors in this suddentragedy of the wilds the ape-man could see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beast must reach his victim before succor could arrive he hurled his spear in the forlorn hope of stopping the carnivore , if only for a moment . The cast was one that only a practiced hand might have dared attempt , for the danger to the baboon was almost as great as that which threatened the panther should the aim of the ape-man not be perfect . Zugash and his bulls , bounding forward at an awkward gallop , reached the edge of the ravine just in time to see the heavy spear hurtle past the head of the she by a margin of inches only and bury itself in the breast of Sheeta . Then they were down the slope , a snarling , snapping pack , and with them went an English viscount , to fall upon a surprised , pain-maddened panther . The baboons leaped in to snap at their hereditary foe and leaped out again , and the man-beast , as quick and agile as they , leaped and struck with his hunting knife , while the frenzied cat lunged this way and that , first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , raking talons reached their mark and two bulls sprawled , torn and bloody , upon the ground ; but the bronzed hide of the ape-man ever cluded the rage of the wounded cat . Short was the furious battle , ferocious the growls and snarls of the combatants , prodigious the leaps and bounds of the excited shes hovering in the background ; and then Sheeta , rearing high upon his hind feet , struck savagely at Tarzan and , in the same instant , plunged to earth dead , slain by the spear point puncturing his heart . Instantly the great tarmangani , who had once been king of the great apes , leaped close and placed a foot upon the carcass of his kill . He raised his face toward Kudu , the sun ; and from his lips broke the horrid challenge of the bull ape that has killed . For a moment silence fell upon the forest , the mountain , and the jungle . Awed , the baboons ceased their restless movement and their din . Tarzan stooped and drew the spear from the quivering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new interest . Then Zugash approached . This time he did not rest the back of his head against the ground in challenge . " The bulls of the tribe of Zugash are the friends of Tarzan of the Apes , " he said . " Tarzan is the friend of the bulls of the tribe of Zugash , " responded the ape-man . " We have seen a tarmangani , " said Zugash . " He has many gomangani . There are many thunder sticks among them . They are bad . Perhaps it is they whom Tarzan seeks . "  | " Perhaps , " admitted the slayer of Sheeta . " Where are they ? " " They were camped where the rocks sit upon themountain side , as here . " He nodded toward the cliff . " Where ? " asked Tarzan again , and this timeZugash motioned along the foothills toward the south.  | THE morning sun shone upon the bosom of Chinnereth , glancing from the breeze born ripples that moved across its surface like vast companies of soldiers passing in review with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspect of beauty . But to Lady Barbara Collis it connoted something quite different  --  a shallow splendor concealing cruel and treacherous depths , the real Chinnereth . She shuddered as she approached its shore surrounded by the apostles , preceded by Abraham , the son of Abraham , and followed by the elders and the villagers . Among them , somewhere , she knew were the six with their great net and their fibre ropes . How alike were they all to Chinnereth , hiding their cruelty and their treachery beneath a thin veneer of godliness ! But there the parallel terminated , for Chinnereth was beautiful . She glanced at the faces of the men nearest her , and again she shuddered . " So God created man in his own image , ' " she mused . " Who , then , created these ? " During the long weeks that fate had held her in this land of Midian she had often sought an explana/tion of the origin of this strange race , and the deductionsof her active mind had not deviated greatly from the truth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them from other peoples she had seen , recalling their common tendency to epilepsy , she had concluded that they were the inbred descendants of a common ancestor , himself a defective and an epileptic . This theory explained much ; but it failed to explain Jezebel , who insisted that she was the child of two of these creatures and that , insofar as she knew , no new strain of blood had ever been injected into the veins of the Midian by intermating with other peoples . Yet , somehow , Lady Barbara knew that such a strain must have been introduced , though she could not guess the truth nor the antiquity of the fact that lay buried in the grave of a little slave girl . And their religion ! Again she shuddered . What a hideous travesty of the teachings of Christ ! It was a confused jumble of ancient Christianity and still more ancient Judaism , handed down by word of mouth through a half imbecile people who had no written language ; a people who had confused Paul the Apostle with Christ the Master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while interpolating hideous barbarisms of their own invention . Sometimes she thought she saw in this exaggerated deviation a suggestion of parallel to other so-called Christian sects of the civilized outer world . But now her train of thoughts was interrupted by the near approach of the procession to the shore of thep113lake . Here was the flat-topped lava rock of grim suggestiveness and hideous memory . How long it seemed since she had watched the six hurl their screaming victim from its well worn surface , and yet it had been but yesterday . Now it was her turn . The Prophet and the Apostles were intoning their senselessgibberish , meant to impress the villagers with their erudition and cloak the real vacuity of their minds , a practice not unknown to more civilized sects . She was halted now upon the smooth surface of the lava , polished by soft sandals and naked feet through the countless years that these cruel rites had been enactedbeside the waters of Chinnereth . Again she heard the screams of yesterday 's victim . But Lady Barbara Collis had not screamed , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least . Abraham , the son of Abraham , motioned the six to the fore ; and they came , bearing their net and their cords . At their feet lay the lava fragment that would weight the net and its contents . The Prophet raised his hands above his head and the people kneeled . In the forefront of their ranks Lady Barbara saw the golden haired Jezebel ; and her heart was touched , for there were anguish in the beautiful face and tears In the lovely eyes . Here was one , at least , who could harbor love and compassion . " I have walked with Jehovah , " cried Abraham , the son of Abraham , and Lady Barbara wondered that he did not have blisters on his feet , so often he walked with Jehovah . The levity of the conceit brought an involuntary smile to her lips , a smile that the Prophetp114noticed . " You smile , " he said , angrily . " You smile when you should scream and beg for mercy as the others do . Why do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " replied Lady Barbara , though she was very much afraid . " Why art thou not afraid , woman ? " demanded the old man . " I , too , have walked with Jehovah , " she replied , " and He told me to fear not , because you are a false prophet , and " " Silence 1 " thundered Abraham , the son of Abraham . " Blaspheme no more . Jehovah shall judge you in a moment . " He turned to the six . " Into the net with her ! " Quickly they did his bidding ; and as they commenced to swing her body to and fro , to gain momentum against the moment that they would release their holds and cast her into the deep lake , she heard The Prophet reciting her iniquities that Jehovah was about to judge in his own peculiar way . His speech was punctuated by the screams and groans of those of the company who were seized in the grip of the now familiarattacks to which Lady Barbara had become so accustomed as to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pocket the girl extracted the little pen knife that was her only weapon and held it firmly in one hand , the blade open and ready for the work she intended it to do . And what work was that ? Surely , she could not hope to inflict instant death upon herself with that inadequate weapon ! Yet , in the lastp115stages of fear induced by utter helplessness and hopelessnessone may attempt anything , even the impossible . Now they were swinging her far out over Chinnereth . The Apostles and the elders were intoning their weird chant in voices excited to frenzy by the imminence of death , those who were not writhing upon the rocky face of the altar in the throes of seizures . Suddenly came the word from Abraham , the son of Abraham . Lady Barbara caught her breath in a last frightened gasp . The six released their holds . A loud scream arose from the huddled villagers  --  the scream of a woman  --  and as she plunged toward the dark waters Lady Barbara knew that it was the voice of Jezebel crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed above her head . At that very moment Lafayette Smith , A.M. , Ph.D. , Sc.D. , was stumbling along a rocky mountain side that walled the great crater where lay the land of Midian and Chinnereth . He was no less aware of the tragedy being enacted upon the opposite side of that stupendous wall than of the fact that he was moving directly away from the camp he was seeking . Had there been anyone there to tell him , and had they told him , that he was hopelessly lost he would have been inclined to dispute the statement , so positive as he that he was taking a short cut to camp , which be imagined was but a little distance ahead . Although he had been without supper and breakfast , hunger had not as yet caused him any annoyance , partially because of the fact that he had hadp116some chocolate with him , which had materially assistedin allaying its pangs , and partially through his interest in the geologic formations that held the attention of his scholarly mind to the exclusion of such material considerations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question of personal safety was relegated to the oblivion that usually engulfed all practical issues when Lafayette Smith was immersed in the pleasant waters of research . Consequently he was unaware of the proximity of a tawny body , nor did the fixed and penetrating gaze of a pair of cruel , yellow-green eyes penetrate the armor of his preoccupation to disturb that sixth sense that is popularly supposed to warn us of unseen danger . Yet even had any premonition of threat to his life or safety disturbed him he doubtless would have ignored it , safe in the consciousness that he was adequately protected by the possession of his .32 caliber , nickel plated pistol . Moving northward along the lower slopes of a conical mountain , the mind of the geologist became more and more deeply engrossed in the rocky story that Nature had written upon the landscape , a story so thrilling that even thoughts of camp were forgotten ; and as he made his way farther and farther from camp a great lion stalked in his wake . What hidden urge prompted Numa thus to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not have guessed . He was not hungry , for he had but recently finished a kill , nor was he a man-eater , though a properly balanced combination of circum/stances might easily find the scales tipped in that directionby hunger , inevitable and oft recurring . It may have been only curiosity , or , again , some motive akin to that playfulness which is inherent in all cats . For an hour Numa followed the man  --  an hour of intense interest for both of them  --  an hour that would have been replete with far greater interest for the man , if less pleasurable , had he shared with Numa the knowledge of their propinquity . Then the man halted before a narrow vertical cleft in the rocky escarpment towering above him . Here was an interestingentry in the book of Nature ! What titanic force had thus rent the solid rock of this mighty mountain ? It had its own peculiar significance , but what was it ? Perhaps elsewhere on the face of the mountain , that here became precipitous , there would be other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up at the face of the cliff towering above him , he looked ahead in the direction he had been going ; and then he looked back in the direction from which he had come  --  and saw the lion . For a long moment the two stared at one another . Surprise and interest were the most definitely registeredof the emotions that the discovery engendered in the mind of the man . Suspicion and irritability were aroused in Numa . " Most interesting , " thought Lafayette Smith . " A splendid specimen ; " but his interest in lions was purely academic , and his thoughts quickly reverted to the more important phenomenon of the crack in the mountain , which now , again , claimed his undivided atten/tion . From which it may be inferred that Lafayette Smith was either an inordinately courageous man or a fool . Neither assumption , however , would be wholly correct , especially the latter . The truth of the matter is that Lafayette Smith suffered from inexperience and impracticality . While he knew that a lion was , per se @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this lion should attack him . He , Lafayette Smith , had done nothing to offend this , or any other , lion ; he was attendingto his own affairs and , like the gentleman he was , expected others , including lions , to be equally considerate . Furthermore , he had a childlike faith in the infallibility of his nicket plated .32 should worse develop into worst . Therefore he ignored Numa and returned to contemplation of the intriguing crack . It was several feet wide and was apparent as far up the face of the cliff as he could see . Also there was every indication that it continued far below the present surface of the ground , but had been filled by debris brought down by erosion from above . How far into the mountain it extended he could not guess ; but he hoped that it ran back , and was open , for a great distance , in which event it would offer a most unique means for studying the origin of this mountainmassif . Therefore , with this thought uppermost in his mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his consciousness , he entered the narrow opening to the intriguing fissure . Here he discovered that the cleft curved gradually to the left and that it extended upward to the surface , where it was considerably widerp119than at the bottom , thus affording both light and air for the interior . Thrilled with excitement and glowing with pride in his discovery , Lafayette clambered inward over the fallen rocks that littered the floor of the fissure , intentnow on exploring the opening to its full extent and then working back slowly to the entrance in a more leisurely manner , at which time he would make a minute examination of whatever geological record Nature had imprinted upon the walls of this majestic corridor . Hunger . thirst , camp , and the lion were forgotten . Numa , however , was no geologist . The great cleft aroused no palpitant enthusiasm within his broad breast . It did not cause him to forget anything , and it intrigued his interest only to the extent of causing him to speculate on why the man-thing had entered it . Having noted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Numa could not attribute his disappearancewithin the maw of the fissure to flight , of which it bore not a single earmark ; and it may be recorded here that Numa was an expert on flight . All of his life things had been fleeing from him . It had always seemed to Numa an unfair provision of Nature that things should so almost inevitably seek to escape him , especially those things he most coveted . There were , for example , Pacco , the zebra , and Wappi , the antelope , the tenderest and most deliciousof his particular weaknesses , and , at the same time , the fleetest . It would have been much simpler all around had Kota the tortoise been endowed withp120the speed of Pacco and Pacco with the torpidity of Kota . But in this instance there was nothing to indicate that the man-thing was fleeing him . Perhaps , then , there was treachery afoot . Numa bristled . Very cautiously he approached the fissure into which his quarry had disappeared . Numa was beginning to think of Lafayette Smith in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commenced to arouse within his belly the first , faint suggestions of hunger . He approached the cleft and looked in . The tarmangani was not in sight . Numa was not pleased , and he evidencedhis displeasure by an angry growl . A , hundred yards within the fissure Lafayette Smith heard the growl and halted abruptly . " That damn lion ! " he ejaculated . " I had forgotten all about him . " It now occurred to him that this might be the beast 's lair  --  a most unhappy contretemps , if true . A realization of his predicament at last supplanted the geologic reveries that had filled his mind . But what to do ? Suddenly his faith in his trusty .32 faltered . As he recalled the appearance of the great beast the weapon seemed less infallible , yet it still gave him a certain sense of assurance as his fingers caressed its grip . He determined that it would not be wise to retrace his steps toward the entrance at this time . Of course the lion might not have entered the fissure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the other hand , he might , in which event a return toward the opening could prove embarrassing , if not dis/astrous . Perhaps , if he waited a while , the lion would go away ; and in the meantime , he decided , it would be discreet to go still farther along the cleft , as the lion , if it entered at all , might conceivably not proceed to the uttermost depths of the corridor . Further , there was the chance that he would find some sort of sanctuary farther in  --  a cave , a ledge to which he could climb , a miracle . Lafayette Smith was open to anything by this time . And so he scrambled on , tearing his clothes and his flesh as well on sharp fragments of tumbled rock , going deeper into this remarkable corridor that seemed endless . In view of what might be behind him he hoped that it was endless . He had shuddered regularlyto the oft recurring expectation of running into a blank wall just beyond that portion of the gently curving fissure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event . With his back to the rocky end of the cul-de-sac he would face back down the corridor , his pistol ready in his hand . Presently the lion would appear and discover him . At this point he had some difficulty in constructing the scene , because he did not know just what the lion would do . Perhaps , seeing a man , cowed by the superiorgaze of the human eye , he would turn in hasty retreat . And then again , perhaps he would not . LafayetteSmith was inclined to the conclusion that he would not . But then , of course , he had not had sufficientexperience of wild animals to permit him to pose as an authority on the subject . To be sure , upon another occasion , while engaged in field work , he had been chased by a cow . Yet even this experience had not been conclusive  --  it had not served to definitely demonstrate the cow 's ultimate intent  --  for the very excellent reason that Lafayette had attained a fence two jumps ahead of her . Confused as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of leonine psychology , he was convinced that he must attempt to visualize the expectant scene that he might be prepared for the eventuality . Forging grimly ahead over the roughly tumbled fragments , casting an occasional glance backward , he again pictured his last stand with his back against the corridor 's rocky end . The lion was creeping slowly toward him , but Lafayette was waiting until there should be no chance of a miss . He was very cool . His hand was steady as he took careful aim . Here regrets interrupted the even tenor of his musing  --  regrets that he had not practiced more assiduouslywith his revolver . The fact that he had never discharged it troubled him , though only vaguely , since he harbored the popular subconscious conviction that if a firearm is pointed in the general direction of an animate object it becomes a deadly weapon . However , in this mental picture he took careful aim  --  the fact that he was utilizing the front sight only giving him no concern . He pulled the trigger . The lion staggered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and as he sank to the ground Lafayette Smith breathed a genuine sigh of relief . He felt himself trembling slightly to the reaction of the nervous strain he had been undergoing . He stopped ,  |p123and  , withdrawing a handkerchief from his pocket , mopped the perspiration from his forehead , smiling a little as he realized the pitch of excitement to which ' he had aroused himself . Doubtless the lion had alreadyforgotten him and had gone on about his business , he soliloquized . He was facing back in the direction from which he had come as this satisfying conclusion passed through his mind ; and then , a hundred feet away , where the corridor passed from view around a curve , the lion appeared.  | THE " Gunner " was perturbed . It was morning , and Lafayette Smith was still missing . They had searched for him until late the previous night , and now they were setting forth again . Ogonyo , the headman , acting under instructions from the " Gunner " had divided the party into pairs and , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these were to search in different directions combing the country carefully for trace of the missing man . Danny had selected Obambi as his companion , a fact which irked the black boy considerably as he had been the target for a great deal of angry vituperation ever since Danny had discovered , the afternoon before , that he had left Smith alone in the mountains . " It do n't make no difference what he told you , you punk , " the " Gunner " assured him , " you did n't have no business leavin ' him out there alone . Now I 'm goin ' to take you for a walk , and if we do n't find Lafayette you ai nt never comin ' back . " " Yes , bwana , " replied Obambi , who had not even a crude idea of what the white man was talking about . One thing , however , pleased him immensely and that was that the bwana insisted on carrying his own gun ,  |p12Sleaving  nothing for Obambi to carry but a light lunch and two fifty-round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirteen ounces of a Thompson submachine gun would have been an exceptionally heavy burden , but that Obambi was always glad to be relieved of any burden . He would have been mildly grateful for a load reduction of even thirteen ounces . The " Gunner , " in attempting to determine the probable route that Smith would have followed in his search for camp , reasoned in accordance with what he assumed he would have done under like circumstances ; and , knowing that Smith had been last seen well above the camp and a little to the north of it , he decided to search in a northerly direction along the foothills , it being obvious that a man would come down hill rather than go farther up in such an emergency . The day was hot and by noon the " Gunner " was tired , sweating , and disgusted . He was particularly disgusted with Africa , which , he informed Obambi , was " a hell of a burgh . " " Geeze , " he grumbled ; " I 've walked my lousy legs off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Loop to Cicero . I been six hours , and I could of done it in twenty minutes in a taxi . Of course they ai nt got no cops in Africa , but they ai nt got no taxis either . " " Yes , bwana , " agreed Obambi . " Shut up ! " growled the " Gunner . " They were sitting beneath the shade of a tree on a hillside , resting and eating their lunch . A short distance below them the hillside dropped sheer in a fifty foot cliff , a fact that was not apparent from wherep126they sat , any more than was the palisaded village at the cliff 's base . Nor did they see the man squatting by a bush at the very brink of the cliff . His back was toward them , as , from the concealment of the bush , he gazed down upon the village below . Here , the watcher believed , was the man he sought ; but he wished to make sure , which might require days of watching . Time , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it did to any other jungle beast . He would come back often to this vantage spot and watch . Sooner or later he would discover the truth or falsity of his suspicion that one of the white men he saw in the village below was the slave raider for whom he had come north . And so , like a great lion , the ape-man crouched , watching his quarry . Below him Dominic Capietro and Leon Stabutch lolled in the shade of a tree outside the hut of the raider , while a half dozen slave girls waited upon them as they leisurely ate their belated breakfast . A couple of fiery liquid bracers had stimulated their jaded spirits , which had been at low ebb after their awakening following their debauch of the previousday , though , even so , neither could have been correctly described as being in fine fettle . Capietro , who was even more surly and quarrelsomethan usual , vented his spleen upon the hapless slaves , while Stabutch ate in morose silence , which he finally broke to revert to the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the south , " he said . " From all I can learn there 's nothing to be gained looking for the ape-man in this part of the country . "  | " What you in such a hurry to find him for ? " demandedCapietro . " Ai nt my company good enough for you ? " " Business before pleasure , ' you know , comrade , " Stabutch reminded the Italian in a conciliatory tone . " I suppose so , " grunted Capietro . " I should like to visit you again after I have come back from the south , " suggested Stabutch . " You may pot come back . " " I shall . Peter Zveri must be avenged . The obstaclein the path of communism must be removed . " " The monkey-man killed Zveri ? " " No , a woman killed him , " replied the Russian , " but the monkey-man , as you call him , was directly responsible for the failure of all Zveri 's plans and thus indirectly responsible for his death . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck to you , but I do n't envey you your mission . This Tarzan is like a lion with the brain of a man . He is savage . He is terrible . In his own country he is also very powerful . " " I shall get him , nevertheless , " said Stabutch , confidently . " If possible I shall kill him the moment I first see him , before he has an opportunity to become suspicious ; or , if I can not do that , I shall win his confidence and his friendship and then destroy him when he least suspects his danger . " Voices carry upward to a great distance , and so , though Stabutch spoke only in normal tones , the watcher , squatting at the cliff top , smiled  --  just the faintest suggestion of a grim smile.  |p128So  that was why the man from " Russa , " of whom Goloba the headman had told him , was inquiring as to his whereabouts ? Perhaps Tarzan had suspected as much , but he was glad to have definite proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " said Capietro . " He would drive me out of business if he ever learned about me . He is a scoundrel who would prevent a man from earning an honest dollar . " " You may put him from your mind , comrade , " Stabutch assured the raider . " He is already as good as dead . Furnish me with men , and I shall soon be on my way toward the south . " " My villains are already saddling to go forth and find men for your safari , " said Capietro , with a wave of his hand in the direction of the central compound , where a score of cutthroats were saddling their horses in preparation for a foray against a distant Galla village . " May luck go with them , " said Stabutch . " I hope  --  What was that ? " he demanded , leaping to his feet as a sudden crash of falling rock and earth came from behind them . Capietro was also upon his feet . " A landslide , " he exclaimed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! What is that ? " he pointed at an object half way up the cliff  --  the figure of a naked white man clinging to a tree that had found lodgment for its roots in the rocky face of the cliff . The tree , a small one , was bending beneath the weight of the man . Slowly it gave way , there was the sound of rending wood , and then the figure hurtled downward into the villagep129where it was hidden from the sight of the two white watchers by an intervening hut . But Stabutch had seen the giant figure of the almostnaked white long enough to compare it with the description he had had of the man for whom he had come all the long way from Moscow . There could of be two such , of that he was certain . " It is the ape-man ! " he cried . " Come , Capietro , he is ours ! " Instantly the Italian ordered several shiftas to advanceand seize the ape-man . Fortune is never necessarily with either the brave or the virtuous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the banner of the poltroon or the blackguard . Today she deserted Tarzan completely . As he squatted upon the edge of the cliff , looking down pon the village of Dominic Capietro , he suddenly felt e earth giving beneath him . Catlike , he leaped to is feet , throwing his hands above his head , as one does , mechanically , to preserve his balance or seek suport , but too late . With a small avalanche of earth d rock he slid over the edge of the cliff . The tree , rowing part way down the face of the escarpment , roke his fall and , for a moment , gave him hope that he might escape the greater danger of the final plunge to the village , where , if the fall did not kill him it as quite evident that his enemies would . But only or a moment were his hopes aroused . With the reaking of the bending stem hope vanished as he plunged on downward . Danny " Gunner " Patrick , having finished his lunch , lighted a cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a lovely panorama before him . City bred , he saw only a part of what there was to be seen and understood but little of that . What impressed him most was the loneliness of the prospect . " Geeze , " he soliloquized , " what a hideout ! No one would n't never find a guy here . " His eyes suddenly focused upon an object in the foreground . " Hey , smoke , " he whispered to Obambi , " what 's that ? " He pointed in the direction of the thing that had aroused his curiosity . Obambi looked and , when they found it , his keen eyes recognized it for what it was . " It is a man , bwana , " he said . " It is the man who killed Simba in our camp that night . It is Tarzan of the Apes . " " How t'ell do - you kno demanded the " Gunner . " " There is only one Tarzan , " replied the black . " It could be no other , as no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country or the plains country goes thus naked . " The " Gunner " rose to his feet . He was going down to have a talk with the ape-man , who , perhaps , could help him in his search for Lafayette Smith ; but as he arose he saw the man below him leap to his feet and throw his arms above his head . Then he disappeared as though swallowed up by the earth . The " Gunner " knitted his brows . " Geeze , " he remarked to Obambi , " he sure screwed , did n't he ? " " What , bwana ? " asked Obambi . " Shut up , " snapped the " Gunner . " " That wasp131funny , " he muttered . " Wonder what became of him . Guess I 'll give him a tail . Come on , dinge , " he concludedaloud to Obambi . Having learned through experience ( wholly the experience of others who had failed to do so ) that attention to details is essential to the continued pursuit of life , liberty , and happiness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he walked rapidly but cautiously toward the spot where Tarzan had disappeared . He saw that there was a cartridge in the chamber , that the magazine drum was properly attachedand that the fire control lever was set for full automatic fire . In the village , which he could not yet see and of the presence of which he did not dream , the shi f tas were running toward the place where they knew the body of the fallen man must lie ; and in the van were Stabutch and Capietro , when suddenly there stepped from the interior of the last hut the man they sought . They did not , know that he had alighted on the thatched roof of the hut from which he had just emerged , nor that , though he had broken through it to the floor below , it had so broken his fall that he had suffered no disabling injury . To them it seemed a miracle ; and to see him thus , apparently uninjured , took the two white men so by surprise that they halted in their tracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Stabutch was the first to regain his presence of mind . Whipping a revolver from its holster he was aboutp132to fire point blank at the ape-man , when Capietro struck his hand up . " Wait , " growled the Italian . " Do not be too fast . I am in command here . " " But it is the ape-man , " cried Stabutch . " I know that , " replied Capietro , " and for that very reason I wish to take him alive . He is rich . He will bring a great ransom . " " Damn the ransom , " ejaculated Stabutch . " It is his life I want . " " Wait until I have the ransom , " said Capietro , " and then you can go after him . " In the meantime Tarzan stood watching the two . He saw that his situation was fraught with exceptional danger . It was to the interest of either one of these men to kill him ; and while the ransom of which one spoke might deter him temporarily he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one to kill him rather than to take the chance that he might escape , while it was evident that the Russian already considered that he had sufficient provocation , and Tarzan did not doubt but that he would find the means to accomplish his design even in the face of the Italian 's objections . If he could but get among them , where they could not use firearms against him , because of the danger that they might kill members of their own party , he felt that , by virtue of his superior strength , speed and agility , he might fight his way to one of the palisaded walls of the village where he would have a fair chance to escape . Once there he could scale the palisade with the speed of Manu , the monkey , and with little dangerp133other than from the revolvers of the two whites , since he held the marksmanship of the shiftas in contempt . He heard Capietro call to his men to take him alive ; and then , waiting not upon them , he charged straight for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savage growl of a wild beast that had , upon more than a single occasion in the past , wrought havoc with the nerves of human antagonists . Nor did it fail in its purpose now . Shocked and unnervedfor the instant , Stabutch fell back while Capietro , who had no desire to kill the ape-man unless it became necessary , leaped to one side and urged his followers to seize him . For a moment bedlam reigned in the village of the white raider . Yelling , cursing men milled about a white giant who fought with his bare hands , , seizing an antagonist and hurling him in the faces of others , or , using the body of another like a flail , sought to mow down those who opposed him . Among the close massed fighters , excited curs ran yelping and barking , while children and women upon the outskirts of the melee shrieked encouragement to the men . Slowly Tarzan was gaining ground toward one of the coveted walls of the village where , as he stepped quickly backward to avoid a blow , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen men . From the top of the cliff " Gunner " Patrick looked down upon this scene . " That mob has sure got him on the spot , " he said aloud . " He 's a regular guy , too . I guess here 's where I step for him . "  | " Yes , bwana , " agreed the willing Obambi . " Shut up , " said the " Gunner , " and then he raised the butt of the Thompson to his shoulder and squeezed the trigger . Mingled with the rapid reports of the machine gun were the screams and curses of wounded and frightenedmen and the shrieks of terrified women and children . Like snow before a spring shower , the pack that had surrounded Tarzan melted away as men ran for the shelter of their huts or for their saddled ponies . Capietro and Stabutch were among the latter , and even before Tarzan could realize what had happened he saw the two racing through the open gates of the village . The " Gunner , " noting the satisfactory effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready again to rain a hail of death down upon the village should necessity require . He had aimed only at the outskirts of the crowd surrounding the ape-man , for fear that a bullet might strike the man he was endeavoring to succor ; but he was ready to risk finer shooting should any press the naked giant too closely . He saw Tarzan standing alone in the village street like a lion at bay , and then he saw his eyes ranging about for an explanation of the burst of fire that had liberated him . " Up here , fellar ! " shouted the " Gunner . " The ape-man raised his eyes and located Danny instantly . " Wait , " he called ; " I 'll be up there in a moment . "  | AS THE waters of Chinnereth closed over the head of Lady Barbara , the golden haired Jezebelsprang to her feet and ran swiftly forward among the men congregated upon the great flat lava rock from which the victim of their cruel fanaticism had been hurled to her doom . She pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brink , tears streaming from her eyes and sobs choking her throat . Abraham , the son of Abraham , standing directly in her path , was the first to guess her purpose to throw herself into the lake and share the fate of her loved istress . Impelled by no humanitarian urge , but ether by a selfish determination to save the girl for another fate which he already had chosen for her , the prophet seized her as she was about to leap into the water . Turning upon the old man like a tigress , Jezebel sratched , bit , and kicked in an effort to free herself , which she would have succeeded in doing had not the prophet called the six executioners to his aid . Two of them seized her ; and , seeing that her efforts were tile , the girl desisted ; but now she turned the flood tes of her wrath upon Abraham , the son of Abraham.  | " Murderer ! " she cried . " Son of Satan ! May Jehovahstrike thee dead for this . Curses be upon thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be they and thee for the foul crime thou hast committed here this day . " " Silence , blasphemer ! " screamed Abraham , the son of Abraham . " Make thy peace with Jehovah , for tonightthou shalt be judged by fire . Take her back to the village , " he directed the two who held her , " and make her secure in a cave . Seest thou , too , that she escapeth not . " " Fire or water , it be all the same to me , " cried the girl as they dragged her away , " just so it takes me away forever from this accursed land of Midian and the mad beast who poseth as the prophet of Jehovah . " As Jezebel moved off toward the village between her two guards the villagers fell in behind them , the women calling her foul names and otherwise reviling her , and in the rear of all came the Prophet and the Apostles , leaving a score of their fellows still ' lying upon the ground , where they writhed , unnoticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface of the water had almost stunned Lady Barbara , but she had managed to retain her senses and control of her mental and physical powers , so that , although dazed , she was able to put into effect the plan that she had nursed from the momentthat she was aware of the fate to which the Prophet had condemned her . Being an excellent swimmer and diver the thought of being immersed below the surface of Chinnerethp137for a few minutes had not , in itself , caused her any great mental perturbation . Her one fear had lain in the very considerable possibility that she might be so badly injured by the impact with the water , or stunned , as to be helpless to effect her own release from the net . Her relief was great , therefore , when she discovered that she was far from helpless , nor did she delay an instant in bringing her small pocket knife to play upon the fibre strands of the net that enmeshed her . Slashing rapidly , but yet , at the same time , in accordance with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight line , as the rock dragged her downwardtoward the bottom . Constantly through her mind ran a single admonition  --  " Keep cool ! Keep cool ! " Should she permit herself to - give away to hysteria , even for an instant , she knew that she must be lost . The lake seemed bottomless , the strands innumerable , while the knife grew constantly duller , and her strength appeared to be rapidly ebbing . " Keep cool ! Keep cool ! " Her lungs were bursting . " Just a moment more ! Keep cool ! " She felt unconsciousness creeping upon her . She struggled to drag herself through the opening she had made in the net  --  her senses reeled dizzily  --  she was almost unconsciousas she shot rapidly toward the surface . As her head rose above the surface those standing upon the rock above her had their attention riveted upon Jezebel who was engaged at that moment in kickingthe prophet of Paul , the son of Jehovah , on the shins . Lady Barbara was ignorant of all this ; but itp138was fortunate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Midians from noticing her resurrection from the deep and permitted her to swim , unseen , beneath the shelter of the overhanging rock from which she had been precipitated into the lake . She was very weak , and it was with a prayer of thanksgiving that she discovered a narrow ledge of beach at the water 's edge beneath the great lava block that loomed above her . As she dragged herself wearilyout upon it she heard the voices of those upon the rock overhead  --  the voice of Jezebel cursing the Prophet and the old man 's threat against the girl . A thrill of pride in the courage of Jezebel warmed the heart of Lady Barbara , as did the knowledge that she had won a friend so loyal and devoted that she would put her own life in jeopardy merely for the sake of openly accusing the murderer of her friend . How magnificent she was in the primitive savagery of her denunciation ! Lady Barbara could almost see her standing there defying the greatest power that her world knew , her golden hair framing her oval face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her lithe young body tense with emotion . And what she had heard , and the thought of the helplessness of the young girl against the power of the vile old man , changed Lady Barbara 's plans completely . She had thought to remain in hiding until night and then seek to escape this hideous valley and its mad denizens . There would be no pursuit , for they would think her dead at the bottom of Chinnereth ; and thus she might seek to find her way to the outerp139world with no danger of interference by the people- of the land of Midian . She and Jezebel had often speculated upon the likelihoodof the existence of a possible avenue of ascent of the crater wall ; and from the entrance of their Cave they had chosen a spot about midway of the western face of the crater , where the rim had fallen inward , as offering the best chance of escape . Tumbled masses of rock rose here from the bottom of the valley almost to the summit of the crater , and here Lady Barbara had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now all was changed . She could not desert Jezebel , whose life was now definitely jeopardized because of her friendship and loyalty . But what was she to do ? How could she be of assistance to the girl ? She did not know . Of only one thing was she certainshe must try . She had witnessed enough horrors in the village of the South Midians to know that whatever Abraham , the son of Abraham , planned for Jezebel would doubtessbe consummated after dark , the time he chose , byreference , for all the more horrible of his so-calledcligious rites . Only those which took them to a distance from the village , such as immersions in theaters of Chinnereth , were performed by daylight . With these facts in mind , Lady Barbara decided that she might , with safety , wait until after dark beforeapproaching the village . To do so earlier might only result in her own recapture , an event that would render her helpless in effecting the succor of Jezebel , while giving the Prophet two victims instead of one.  | The sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vituperations of the women diminishing in the distance , and by this she had known that the party had returned to the village . It was cold beneath the shadow of the rock , with her wet clothing clinging to her tired body ; and so she slipped back into the water and swam along the shore a few yards until she found a spot where she could crawl out and lie in the pleasant warmth of the sun . Here she rested again for a few minutes , and then she cautiously ascended the bank until her eyes were on a level with the ground . At a little distance she saw a woman , lying prone , who was trying to raise herself to a sitting position . She was evidently weak and dazed , and Lady Barbara realized that she was recovering from one of those horrid seizures to which nearly all the inhabitants of the village were subject . Near her were others , some lying quietly , some struggling ; and in the direction of the village she saw severalwho had recovered sufficiently to attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concealed behind a low shrub , Lady Barbara watched and waited for half an hour , until the last of the unfortunate band had regained consciousness and self control sufficiently to permit them to depart in the direction of their squalid habitations . She was alone now with little or no likelihood of discovery . Her clothes were still wet and exceedingly uncomfortable ; so she quickly removed them and spread them in the hot sun to dry , while she luxuriatedp141In the soothing comfort of a sun bath , alternated with in occasional dip in the waters of the lake . Before the sun dropped to the western rim of the crater her clothing had dried ; and now she sat , fully dressed again , waiting for darkness to fall . Below Icr lay the waters of the lake and beyond its farther Shore she could dimly see the outlines of the village of the North Midians , where dwelt the mysterious " beautil men " of Jezebel 's day dreams . Doubtless , thought Lady Barbara , the prince charm- ; of the golden one 's imagination would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , even so , were difficult to imagine more degraded or repulsive ales than those of her own village . Almost anymg  --  even a gorilla  --  might seem preferable to em . As night approached , the girl saw little lights commence to twinkle in the northern village  --  the cooking fires doubtless  --  and then she rose and turned her cc toward the village of Abraham , the son of Abram , of Jobab and Timothy and Jezebel , toward cerindanger and possible death . As she walked along the now familiar path towardvillage , the mind of Lady Barbara Collis was ed by the seemingly hopeless problem that conntedher , while hovering upon the verge of her sciousness was that fear of the loneliness and the rkness of an unfamiliar and inhospitable country at is inherent in most of us . Jezebel had told her at dangerous beasts were almost unknown in the d of Midian , yet her imagination conjured slinkingp142forms in the darkness and the sound of padded feet upon the trail behind her and the breathing of savage lungs . Yet ahead of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swiftly striking talons and powerfuljaws . She recalled that she had heard that men who had been mauled by lions , and lived to narrate their experiences , had all testified uniformly to the fact that there had been no pain and little terror during the swift moments of the experience ; and she knew that there was a theory propounded by certain students of animal life that . the killing of the carnivores was alwaysswift , painless , and merciful . Why was it , she wondered , that of all created things only man was wantonly cruel and only man , and the beasts that were trained by , man , killed for pleasure ? But now she was nearing the village and passing from the possibility of attack by merciful beasts to the assurance of attack by merciless men , should she be apprehended by them . To reduce this risk she skirted the village at a little distance and came to the foot of the cliff where the caves were located and where she hoped to find Jezebel and , perhaps , discover a means of liberating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which seemed to be deserted , most of the villagers being congregated about a group of small cooking fires near the few huts at the foot of the cliff . They often cooked thus togethergossiping and praying and narrating experiencesand revelations  --  they all received revelations from Jehovah when they " walked " with Him , whichP143was their explanation of their epileptic seizures . The more imaginative members of the community ere the recipients of the most remarkable revelaions ; but , as all of them were stupid , Jehovah had ot , at least during Lady Barbara 's sojourn among cm , revealed anything of a particularly remarkable r inspiring nature . Their gossip , like their " experiences , " was mean and narrow and sordid . Each ught constantly to discover or invent some scandal r heresy in the lives of his fellows , and if the finger ointed at one not in the good graces of the Prophet r the Apostles the victim was quite likely to make a oman holiday . Seeing the villagers congregated about their fires , dy Barbara commenced the ascent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cliff . She moved owly and cautiously , stopping often to look about r , both above and below ; but , notwithstanding her ars and doubts she finally reached the mouth of the ve that she and Jezebel had occupied . If she hopedfind the golden one there she was disappointed ; t at least , if Jezebel were not there , it was a relief find that no one else was ; and with a sense of eater security than she had felt since the dawn of is eventful day she crawled into the interior and rew herself down upon the straw pallet that the girls d shared . Home ! This rough lair , no better than that which used the beasts of the wilds , was home now to Lady rbara Collis whose life had been spent within the role halls of the Earl of Whimsey . Permeatingp144it were memories of the strange friendship and affection that had gradually united these two girls whose origins and backgrounds could scarcely have been more dissimilar . Here each had learned the language of the other , here they had laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and here they had planned together a future in which they would not be separated . The cold walls seemed warmer because of the love and loyalty to which they had been silent witnesses . But now Lady Barbara was here alone . Where was Jezebel ? It was the answer to that question that the English girl must find . She recalled the Prophet 's threat  --  " for tonight thou shalt be judged by fire . " She must hasten , then , if she were to save Jezebel . But how was she to accomplish it in the face of all the seemingly insurmountable obstacles which confrontedher ?  --  her ignorance of where Jezebel was being held , the numbers of her enemies , her lack of knowledge of the country through which they would be forced ' to flee should she be so fortunate as to effect the girl 's escape from the village . She roused herself . Lying here upon her pallet would accomplish nothing . She rose and looked down toward the village ; and instantly she was all alertnessagain , for there was Jezebel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many villagers who maintained an open space about her . Presently the spectators separated and men appeared carrying a burden . What was it ? They laid it in the center of the open space , in front of Jezebel ; and then Ladyp145Barbara saw what it was  --  a large wooden cross . A man was digging a hole at the center of the circu-r space that had been left around the prisoner ; hers were bringing brush and fagots . Now the men who guarded Jezebel seized her and bore her to the round . They laid her upon the cross and stretched her arms out upon the wooden cross arm . Lady Barbara was horror stricken . Were they go-g to perpetrate the horrible atrocity of nailing herthe cross ? Abraham , the son of Abraham , stoodthe head of the cross , his hands in the attitude of layer , a personification of pious hypocrisy . The girl dew that no cruelty , however atrocious , was beyond Im . She knew , too , that she was powerless to preventthe consummation of this foul deed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winds , as , with arning cry that shattered the silence of the night , sped swiftly down the steep pathway toward theage  --  a self-sacrifice offered willingly upon ther of friendship . . Startled by her scream , every eye was turned uprdtoward her . In the darkness they did not recognize her , but their stupid minds were filled with questioningand with terror as they saw something speeddownthe cliff face toward them . Even before sheched the circle of firelight where they stood many had collapsed in paroxysms of epilepsy induced by the nervous shock of this unexpected visitation . When she came closer , and was recognized , others succumbed , for now indeed it appeared that a miracle lad been worked and that the dead had been raisedp146again , even as they had seen the dead girl resurrected the previous day . Pushing aside those who did not quickly enough make way for her , Lady Barbara hastened to the centerof the circle . As his eyes fell upon her , Abraham , the son of Abraham , paled and stepped back . For a moment he seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " he cried . " What are you doing here ? " " You know who I am , " replied Lady Barbara . " Why do you tremble if you do not know that I am the messenger of Jehovah whom you reviled and sought to destroy ? I am here to save the girl Jezebel from death . Later Jehovah will send His wrath upon Abraham , the son of Abraham , and upon all the people of the land of Midian for their cruelties and their sins . " " I did not know , " cried the Prophet . " Tell Jehovahthat I did not know . Intercede for me , that Jehovah may forgive me ; and anything within my power to grant shall be yours . " So great was her surprise at the turn events had taken that Lady Barbara , who had expected only oppositionand attack , was stunned for the moment . Here was an outcome so foreign to any that she had imagined that she had no response ready . She almost laughed aloud as she recalled the fears that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape . And now it was all so easy . " Liberate the girl , Jezebel , " she commanded , " and then make food ready for her and for me. "  | " Quick ! " cried the Prophet . " Raise the girl and set her free . " " Wait ! " exclaimed a thin , querulous voice behind im . " I have walked with Jehovah . " All turned in c direction of the speaker . He was Jobab the postle . " Quick ! Release her ! " demanded Lady Barbara , ho , in this interruption and in the manner and voice f the speaker , whom she knew as one of the most natically intolerant of the religious bigots of Midian , w the first spark that might grow into a flame of sistance to the will of the Prophet ; for she knew ese people well enough to be sure that they would asp at any excuse to thwart the abandonment of eir cruel pleasure . " Wait ! " shrieked Jobab . " I have walked with ovah , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apostle , a seeming miracle shall be ought out of Chinnereth ; but be not deceived , for ay unto ye that it shall be the work of Satan ; and hosoever believeth in it shall perish . ' " " Hallelujah ! " shrieked a woman , and the cry was ken up by the others . To right and left the excited lagers were being stricken by their Nemesis . A  --  re of writhing bodies jerked and struggled uponground in the throes of convulsions , the horrible ' king , the frothing at the mouth , adding to the hor-r of the scene . For a moment , Abraham , the son of Abraham , stood silent in thought . A cunning light flickered sudlyin his crafty eyes , and then he spoke . " Amen ! "  | he said . " Let the will of Jehovah be done as revealed to the Apostle Jobab . Let Jobab speak the word of Jehovah , and upon Jobab 's head be the reward . " " Another cross , " screamed Jobab ; " bring another cross . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavens , and if either of these be His children He will not let them be consumed , " and so , as Abraham , the son of Abraham , had passed the buck to Jobab , Jobab passed it along to Jehovah , who has been the recipient of more than His share through the ages . Futile were the threats and arguments of Lady Barbaraagainst the blood lust of the Midians . A second cross was brought , a second hole dug , and presently both she and Jezebel were lashed to the symbols of love and raised to an upright position . The bottoms of the crosses were sunk in the holes prepared for them and earth tamped around them to hold them upright . Then willing hands brought faggots and brushwood and piled them about the bases of the two pyres . Lady Barbara watched these preparations in silence . She looked upon the weak , degenerate faces of this degraded people ; and she could not , even in the extremityof her danger , find it in her heart to condemn them too severely for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , within the memory of man , in the name of religion . She glanced at Jezebel and found the girl 's eyes upon her . " You should not have come back , " said the girl . " You might have escaped . " Lady Barbara shook her head . " You did it for me , " continuedp149Jezebel . " May Jehovah reward you , for I may only think you . " " You would have done the same for me at Chinereth , " replied Lady Barbara . " I heard you defy 1c Prophet there . " Jezebel smiled . " You are the only creature I have ever loved , " she said ; " the only one who I ever night loved me . Of course I would die for you . " Abraham , the son of Abraham , was praying . Young men stood ready with flaming torches , the flick-'rig light from which danced grotesquely upon the eous features of the audience , upon the two great sses , and upon the beautiful faces of the victims . " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good bye , " replied the golden one.  | NOTWITHSTANDING the fact that Lafayette A. Smith had so recently visualized this very emergencyand had , as it were , rehearsed his part in it , now that he stood face to face with the lion he did none of the things exactly as he had pictured . He was not at all cool when he saw the carnivore appear at the turn in the fissure ; he did not face him calmly , draw a deadly bead , and fire . Nothing was in the least as he had imagined it would be . In the first place the distance between them seemed entirely inadequate and the lion much larger than he had supposed any lion could be , while his revolver seemed to shrink to proportions that represented utter futility . All this , however , was encompassed in a single , instantaneousand overwhelming conception . No appreciabletime elapsed , therefore , between the instant that he perceived the lion and that at which he commenced to jerk the trigger of his pistol , which he accomplished , without aiming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headlong over the jumbled rocks Lafayette Smith fled precipitately into the unknown depths of the ancient rift , at his elbow the ghastly fear that beyond each successive turn would loom the rocky terminus ofp151his flight , while just behind him he pictured the ravenouscarnivore thirsting for his blood . The fall of swiftly moving padded feet close behind him urged him to greater speed , the hot breath of the lion surged from the savage lungs to pound upon his ears like surf upon an ocean beach . Such is the power of imagination . It is true that Numa was bounding along the bottom of the rift , but in the opposite direction to that in which Lafayette Smith bounded . Fortunately , for Lafayette , none of his wild shots had struck the lion ; but the booming reverberation of the explosions in the narrow fissure had so surprised and unnerved him that he had wheeled and fled even as the man had . Had the pursuit been as real as Lafayette imagined it , it could have urged him to no greater speed , nor could the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical powers have their limits , and presently the realization that his had about reached theirs forced itself upon Lafayette 's consciousness and with it realization of the futility of further flight . It was then that he turned to make his stand . He was trembling , but with fatigue rather than fear ; and inwardly he was cool as he reloaded his revolver . He was surprised to discover that the lion was not on top of him , but he expected momentarily to see him appear where the fissure turned from his sight . Seating himself on a flat rock he waited the coming of the carnivorewhile he rested , and as the minutes passed and no lion came his wonderment increased . Presently his scientific eye commenced to note the structure of the fissure 's walls about him , and as his interest grew in the geologic facts revealed or suggestedhis interest in the lion waned , until , once again , the carnivore was relegated to the background of his consciousness , while in its place returned the momentarilyforgotten plan to explore the rift to its farthest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he undertook once more the exploration so rudely interrupted . Regained was the keen pleasure of discovery ; forgotten , hunger , fatigue , and personal safety as he advanced along this mysterious path of adventure . Presently the floor of the rift dropped rapidly until it was inclined at an angle that made progress difficult ; and at the same time it narrowed , giving evidence that it might be rapidly pinching out . There was now barely width for him to squeeze forward between the walls when the fissure ahead of him became suddenly shrouded in gloom . Glancing up in search of an explanation of this new phenomenon Lafayette discovered that the walls far above were converging , until directly above him there was only a small streak of sky visible while ahead the rift was evidently closed entirelyat the top . As he pushed on , the going , while still difficult because of the steepness of the floor of the fissure , was improved to some extent by the absence of jumbled rocks underfoot , the closed ceiling of the corridor havingoffered no crumbling rim to the raging elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  darkness , increasing steadily with each few yards until the man was groping his way blindly , though none the less determinedly , toward the unknownthat lay ahead . That an abyss might yawn beyond his next step may have occurred to him , but so impractical was he in all worldly matters while his scientific entity was in the ascendancy that he ignored the simplest considerations of safety . However , no abyss yawned ; and presently , at a turning , daylight showed ahead . It was only a small patch of daylight ; and when he reached the openingthrough which it shone it appeared , at first , that he had achieved the end of his quest  --  that he could proceed no farther . Dropping to his hands and knees he essayed the feat of worming his way through the aperture , which he then discovered was amply large to accommodate his body ; and a moment later he stood erect in astonished contemplation of the scene before him . He found himself standing near the base of a lofty escarpment overlooking a valley that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extinct volcano . Below him spread a panorama of rolling , tree-dotted landscape , broken by occasional huge outcroppingsof weathered lava rock ; and in the center a blue lake danced in the rays of an afternoon sun . Thrilling to an identical reaction such as doubtless dominated Balboa as he stood upon the heights of Darien overlooking the broad Pacific , Lafayette Smith experienced that spiritual elation that is , perhaps , the greatest reward of the explorer . Forgotten , for thep154moment , was the scientific interest of the geologist , submerged by intriguing speculation upon the history of this lost valley , upon which , perhaps , the eyes of no other white man had ever gazed . Unfortunately for the permanency of this beatific state of mind two other thoughts rudely obtruded themselves , as thoughts will . One appertained to the camp , for which he was supposed to be searching , while the other involved the lion , which was supposedly searching for him . The latter reminded him that he was standing directly in front of the mouth of the fissure , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and this suggested the impracticabilityof the fissure as an avenue of return to the opposite side of the crater wall . A hundred yards away Smith espied a tree , and towardthis he walked as offering the nearest sanctuary in the event the lion should reappear . Here , too , he might rest while considering plans for the future ; and , that he might enjoy uninterrupted peace of mind while so engaged , he climbed up into the tree , where , straddlinga limb , he leaned his back against the bole . It was a tree of meager foliage , thus affording him an almost unobstructed view of the scene before him , and as his eyes wandered across the landscape they were arrested by something at the foot of the southern wall of the crater  --  something that did not perfectly harmonize with its natural surroundings . Here his gaze remained fixed as he sought to identify the thing that had attracted his attention . What it looked like he was positive that it could not be , so definitely hadp155his preconception of the inaccessibility of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the longer he looked the more convinced he became that what he saw was a small village of thatched huts . And what thoughts did this recognition inspire ? What noble and aesthetic emotions were aroused within his breast by the sight of this lonely village in the depths of the great crater which should , by all the proofs that he had seen , have been inaccessible to man ? No , you are wrong again . What it suggested was food . For the first time since he had become lost Lafayette Smith was acutely conscious of hunger , and when he recalled that it had been more than twenty-four hours since he had eaten anything more substantialthan a few chocolates his appetite waxed ravenous . Furthermore , he suddenly realized that he was actually suffering from thirst . At a little distance lay the lake . Glancing back toward the entrance to the fissure he discovered no lion ; and so he dropped to the ground and set off in the direction of the water , laying his course so that at no time was he at any great distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and when he had drunk his fill he became acutely conscious , for the first time during the day , of an overpowering weariness . The water had temporarily relieved the pangs of hunger , and he determined to rest a few minutes before continuing on toward the distant village . Once again he assured himself that there was no pursuing lion in evidence ; and then he stretched himself at full length in the deep grass that grew near the edge of thep156lake , and with a low tree as protection from the hot sun relaxed his tired muscles in much needed rest . He had not intended to sleep ; but his fatigue was greater than he had supposed , so that , with relaxation , unconsciousness crept upon him unawares . Insects buzzed lazily about him , a bird alighted in the tree beneath which he lay and surveyed him critically , the sun dropped lower toward the western rim , and Lafayette Smith slept on . He dreamed that a lion was creeping toward him through high grass . He tried to rise , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He tried to cry out and frighten the lion away , but no sound issued from his throat . Then he made a final supreme effort , and the shriek that resulted awakenedhim . He sat up , dripping with perspiration , and looked quickly and fearfully about him . There was no lion . " Whew ! " he exclaimed . " What a relief . " Then he glanced at the sun and realized that he had slept away the greater part of the afternoon . Now his hunger returned and with it recollection of the distant village . Rising , he drank again at the lake , and then started on his journey toward the base of the southern rim , where he hoped he would find friendly natives and food . The way led for the greater part around the edge of the lake ; and as dusk settled and then darkness it became more and more difficult to move except at a slow and cautious pace , since the ground was often strewn with fragments of lava that were not visible in the darkness.  |p157Night  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and these , seeming nearer than they really were , buoyed his spirits by the assurance that his journey was nearing completion . Yet , as he stumbled onward , the conviction arose that he was pursuing a will-o ' - thewisp , as the firelight appeared to retreat as rapidly as he advanced . At last , however , the outlines of mean huts , illuminedby the fires , became distinguishable and then the figures of people clustered about them . It was not until he was almost within the village that he saw with astonishment that the people were white , and then he saw something else that brought him to a sudden halt . Upon two crosses , raised above the heads of the villagers , were two girls . The firelight played upon their faces , and he saw that both were beautiful . What weird , unholy rite was this ? What strange race inhabited this lost valley ? Who were the girls ? That they were not of the same race as the villagers was apparent at the first casual glance at the degraded features of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was witnessing some sort of religious rite or pageant ; and he assumed that to interrupt it would prove far from a satisfactory introduction to these people , whose faces , which had already repelled him , impressed him so unfavorably that he questioned the friendliness of his reception even under the most favorable auspices . And then a movement of the crowd opened for a moment an avenue to the center of the circle where the crosses stood ; and the man was horrified by what was revealed for an instant to his amazed eyes , for he saw the dry brush and the faggots piled about the bottoms of the crosses and the young men with the flaming torches ready to ignite the inflammable piles . An old man was intoning a prayer . Here and there villagers writhed upon the ground in what Smith thought were evidences of religious ecstacy . And then the old man gave a signal , and the torch bearers appliedthe flames to the dry brush . Lafayette Smith waited to see no more . Leaping forward he thrust surprised villagers from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With a booted foot he kicked the already burning brush aside ; and then , with his little .32 shining in his hand , he turned and faced the astonished and angry crowd . For a moment Abraham , the son of Abraham , was paralyzed by surprise . Here was a creature beyond his experience or his ken . It might be a celestial messenger ; but the old man had gone so far now , and his crazed mind was so thoroughly imbued with the lust for torture , that he might even have defied Jehovah Himself rather than forego the pleasures of the spectaclehe had arranged . At last he found his voice . " What blasphemy is this ? " he screamed . " Set upon this infidel , and tear him limb from limb . " " You will have to shoot , now , " said an English voice at Smith 's back , " for if you do n't they will kill you . " He realized that it was one of the girls upon the crosses  --  another astonishing mystery in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of thep159torch bearers rushed him with a maniacal shriek , and Smith fired . With a scream the fellow clutched his chest and sprawled at the American 's feet ; and at the report of the pistol and the sudden collapse of their fellow the others , who had been moving forward upon the intruder , fell back , while upon all sides the overexcitedcreatures succumbed to the curse that had descended to them from Angustus the Ephesian , until the ground was strewn with contorted forms . Realizing that the villagers were , for the moment atast , too disconcerted and overawed by the death ofeir fellow to press their attack , Smith turned his atntionat once to the two girls . Replacing his pistolits holster , he cut their bonds with his pocket knife before Abraham , the son of Abraham , could collect is scattered wits and attempt to urge his followers torenewed attack . It was more than the work of a moment to liberate the two captives as , after he had cut the bonds that eld their feet Smith had been compelled to partially pport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cured their wrists to the cross arms , lest a bone be broken or a muscle wrenched as the full weight of the victim was thrown suddenly upon one wrist . He had cut Lady Barbara down first ; and she was assisting him with Jezebel , who , having been crucified or a longer time , was unable to stand alone , when Abraham , the son of Abraham , regained sufficient composure to permit him to think and act . Both Lady Barbara and Smith were supporting Jezebel into whose numbed feet the blood was againp160beginning to circulate . Their backs were toward the Prophet ; and , taking advantage of their preoccupation , the old man was creeping stealthily upon them from the rear . In his hand was a crude knife , but none the less formidable for its crudeness . It was the blood stained sacrificial knife of this terrible old high priest of the Midians , more terrible now because of the rage and hatred that animated the cruel , defective mind that directed the claw-like hand that wielded it . All of his rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lady Barbara , in whom he saw the author of his humiliation and his thwarted desires . Stealthily he crept upon her from behind while his followers , frozen to silence by his terrible glances , watched in breathless anticipation . Occupied with the half-fainting Jezebel none of the three at the crosses saw the repulsive figure of the avenger as he towered suddenly behind the English girl , his right hand raised high to drive the blade deeply into her back ; but they heard his sudden , choking , gasping scream and turned in time to see the knife fall from his nerveless fingers as they clutched at his throat , and to witness his collapse . Angustus the Ephesian had reached out of a grave digged two thousand years before , to save the life of Lady Barbara Collis  --  though doubtless he would have turned over in that same grave had he realized the fact.  | LIKE a great cat , Tarzan of the Apes scaled the palisade of the raiders ' village , dropped lightly to the ground upon the opposite side and ascended the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were less precipitous . He might have taken advantage of the open gate ; but the direction he chose was the shorter way ; and a palisade constituted no obstacle to the foster son of Kala , the she-ape . The " Gunner " was waiting for him upon the summitof the cliff directly behind the village , and for the second time these strangely dissimilar men metdissimilar , and yet , in some respects , alike . Eachas ordinarily quiet to taciturnity , each ' was selfliant , each was a law unto himself in his own environment ; but there the similarity ceased for the extremesf environment had produced psychological extremesremotely separated as the poles . The ape-man had been reared amidst scenes of eternal beauty and grandeur , his associates the beasts of the jungle , savage perhaps , but devoid of avarice , petty jealousy , treachery , meanness , and intentionalcruelty ; while the " Gunner " had known naught but the squalid aspects of scenery defiled by man , of hori/zons grotesque with screaming atrocities of architecture , of an earth hidden by concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his associates , in all walks of life , activated by grand and petty meannessesunknown to any but mankind . " A machine gun has its possibilities , " said the apeman , with the flicker of a smile . " They had you in a bad spot , mister , " remarked the " Gunner . " " I think I should have gotten out all right , " repliedTarzan , " but I thank you none the less . How did you happen to be here ? " " I been looking for my side-kick , and I happened to see you go over the edge here . Cotton ball here , tipped me off that you was the guy saved me from the lion ,  --  so I was glad to step for you . " " You are looking for whom ? " " My side-kick , Smith . " " Where is he ? " " I would n't be lookin ' for him if I knew . He 's went and lost himself . Been gone since yesterday afternoon . " " Tell me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you .

Geeze , take a slant at them mountains . You might as well try to meet a guy at the corner of Oak and Polk as hunt for him there . I 'll tell you how it happened , " and then hep163briefly narrated all that was known of the disappearance of Lafayette Smith . " Was he armed ? " asked the ape-man . " He thought he was . " " What do you mean ? " " He packed a shiny toy pistol , what if anybody ever shot me with it , and I found it out , I 'd turn him over my knee and spank him . " " It might serve him in getting food , " said Tarzan , " and that will be of more importance to him than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from men and starvation . Where 's your camp ? " Danny nodded toward the south . " Back there about a thousand miles , " he said . " You 'd better go to it and remain there where he can find you if he can make his way back to it , and where I can find you if I locate him . " " I want to help you hunt for him . He 's a good guy , even if he is legitimate . " " I can move faster alone , " replied the ape-man . " If you start out looking for him I 'll probably have to find you , too . " The " Gunner " grinned . " I guess you ai nt so far off , at that , " he replied . " All right , I 'll beat it for camp and wait there for you . You know where our amp is at ? " " I 'll find out , " replied Tarzan and turned to Obambi to whom he put a few questions in the native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Gunner . " " I know where your camp is now . Watch out for these fellows from that village , and do n't letp164your men wander very far from the protection of your machine gun . " " Why , " demanded Danny , " what are them guys ? " " They are robbers , murderers , and slave raiders , " replied Tarzan . " Geeze , " exclaimed the " Gunner , " " they 's rackets even in Africa , ai nt they ? " " I do not know what a racket is , " replied the ape . man , " but there is crime wherever there are men , and nowhere else . " He turned then , without word of parting , and started upward toward the mountains . " Geeze ! " muttered the " Gunner . " " That guy ai nt so crazy about men . " " What , bwana ? " asked Obambi . " Shut up , " admonished Danny . The afternoon was almost spent when the " Gunner " and Obambi approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , none the less , pushed rapidly along the backtrail lest night descend upon them before they reached their destination , for Danny , in common with most city-bred humans , had discovered something peculiarly depressing and awe-inspiring in the mysterious sounds and silences of the nocturnal wilds . He wished the fires and companionship of men after the sun had set . And so the two covered the distance on the return in much less time than had been consumed in traversing it originally . As he came in sight of the camp the brief twilight of the tropics had already fallen , the cooking fires were burning , and to a trained eye a change would have been apparent from the appearance of the campp165when he had left it early that morning ; but Danny 's eyes were trained in matters of broads , bulls , and beer trucks and not in the concerns of camps and safaris ; so , in the failing light of dusk , he did not notice that there were more men in camp than when he had left , for that toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been before . The first intimation he had of anything unusual me from Obambi . " White men are in the camp , wana , " said the black  --  " and many horses . Perhaps cy found the mad bwana and brought him back . " " Where do you see any white men , tar baby ? " deandedthe " Gunner . " " By the big fire in the center of camp , bwana , " repliedObambi . " Geeze , yes , I see ' em now , " admitted Danny . " They must have found old Smithy all right ; but I n't see him , do you ? " " No , bwana , but perhaps he is in his tent . " The appearance of Patrick and Obambi caused ammotion in the camp that was wholly out of proortionto its true significance . The white men leaped o their feet and drew their revolvers while strangeblacks , in response to the commands of one of these , seized rifles and stood nervously alert . " You do n't have to throw no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the smoke . "  --  The white men were advancing to meet him now , and the two parties halted face to face near one of the fires . It was then that the eyes of one of the two strange white men alighted on the Thompson sub- machine gun . Raising his revolver he covered Danny . " Put up your hands ! " he commanded sharply . " Wotell ? " demanded the " Gunner , " but he put them up as every sensible man does when thus invitedat the business end of a pistol . " Where is the ape-man ? " asked the stranger . " What ape-man ? What you talkin ' about ? What 's your racket ? " " You know who I mean  --  Tarzan , " snapped the other . The " Gunner " glanced quickly about the camp . He saw his own men herded under guard of villanous looking blacks in long robes that had once been white ; he saw the horses tethered just beyond them ; he saw nothing of Lafayette Smith . The training and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't know the guy , " he replied sullenly . " You were with him today , " snarled the bearded white . " You fired on my village . " " Who , me ? " inquired the " Gunner " innocently . " You got me wrong , mister . I been hunting all day . I ai nt seen no one . I ai nt fired at nothing . Now it 's my turn . What are you guys doin ' here with this bunch of Ku Klux Klanners ? If it 's a stick up , hop to it ; and get on your way . You got the drop on us , and they ai nt no one to stop you . Get it over with . I 'm hungry and want to feed . " " Take the gun away from him , " said Capietro , in Galla , to one of his men , " also his pistol , " and there was nothing for Danny " Gunner " Patrick , with his hands above his head , to do but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be herded with the other black prisoners and ordered the " Gunner " to accompanythem to the large fire that blazed in front of Smith 's tent and his own . " Where is your companion ? " demanded Capietro . " What companion ? " inquired Danny . " The man you have been travelling with , " snapped the Italian . " Who else would I mean ? " " Search me , " replied the " Gunner . " " What you mean by that ? You got something concealedupon your person ? " " If you mean money , I ai nt got none . " " You did not answer my question , " continued Capietro . " What question ? " " Where is your companion ? " " I ai nt got none . " " Your headman told us there were two of you . What is your name ? " " Bloom , " replied Danny . Capietro looked puzzled . " The headman said one of you was Smith and the other Patrick . " " Never heard of ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been stringin ' you . I 'm here alone , hunting , and my name 's Bloom . " " And you did n't see Tarzan of the Apes today ? " " Never even heard of a guy with that monacker . " " Either he 's lying to us , " said Stabutch , " or it wasthe other one who fired on the village . " " Sure , it must of been two other fellows , " Danny assured them . " Say , when do I eat ? "  | " When you tell us where Tarzan is , " replied Stabutch . " Then I guess I do n't eat , " remarked Danny . " Geeze , did n't I tell you I never heard of the guy ? Do you think I know every monkey in Africa by his first name ? Come on now , what 's your racket ? If we got anything you want , take it and screw . I 'm sick lookin ' at your mugs . " " I do not understand English so well , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what he says . " " Neither do I , " replied the Russian ; " but I think he is lying to us . Perhaps he is trying to gain time until his companion and Tarzan arrive . " " That is possible , " replied Capietro in his normal voice . " Let 's kill him and get out of here , " suggested Stabutch . " We can take the prisoners and as much of the equipment as you want and be a long way from here in the morning . " " Geeze , " exclaimed Danny , " this reminds me of Chi . It makes me homesick . " " How much money you pay if we do n't kill you ? " asked Capietro . " How much your friends pay ? " The " Gunner " laughed . " Say , mister , you 're giving yourself a bum steer . " He was thinking how much more one might collect for killing him , if one could make connections with certain parties on the North Side of Chicago , than for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , to gain time . The " Gunner " did not wish to be killed , and so he alteredp169his technique . " My friends ai nt rich , " he said , " but they might come across with a few grand . How much do you want ? " Capietro considered . This must be a rich American , for only rich men could afford these African big game expeditions . " One hundred thousand should not be excessive for a rich man like you , " he said . " Quit your kidding , " said the " Gunner . " " I ai n't rich . " " What could you raise ? " asked Capietro , who saw by the prisoner 's expression of astonishment that the original bid was evidently out of the question . " I might scrape up twenty grand , " suggested Danny . " What are grand ? " demanded the Italian . " Thousand  --  twenty thousand , " explained the " Gunner . " " Poof ! " cried Capietro . " That would not pay me for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forwarded from America . Make it fifty thousand lire and it 's a bargain . " " Fifty thousand lire ? What 's them ? " " A lire is an Italian coin worth about twenty cents in American money , " explained Stabutch . Danny achieved some rapid mental calculations before he replied ; and when he had digested the result he had difficulty in repressing a smile , for he discovered that his offer of twenty thousand grand was actually twice what the Italian was now demanding . Yet he hesitated to agree too willingly . " That 's ten thousand iron men , " he said . " That 's a lot of jack . "  | " Iron men ? Jack ? I do not understand , " said Capietro . " Smackers , " explained Danny lucidly . " Smackers ? Is there such a coin in America ? " asked Capietro , turning to Stabutch . " Doubtless a vernacularism , " said the Russian . " Geeze , you wops is dumb , " growled the " Gunner . " " A smacker 's a buck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would tell him in dollars it would be easier , " suggested Stabutch . " We all understand the value of an American dollar . " " That 's a lot more than some Americans understand , " Danny assured him ; " but it 's just what I been saying right along  --  ten thousand dollars  --  and it 's too damn much . " " That is for you to decide , " said Capietro . " I am tired of bargaining  --  nobody but an American would bargain over a human life . " " What you been doing ? " demanded the " Gunner . " " You 're the guy that started it . " Capietro shrugged . " It is not my life , " he said . " You will pay me ten thousand American dollars , or you will die . Take your choice . " " Oke , " said Danny . " I 'll pay . Now do I eat ? If you do n't feed me I wo n't be worth nothing . " " Tie his hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell to discussing plans with Stabutch . The Russian finally agreed with Capietro that the palisadedvillage of the raider would be the best place to defend themselves in the event that Tarzan enlisted aid and attacked them in force . One of their men hadp171seen Lord Passmore 's safari ; and , even if their prisonerwas lying to them , there was at least another white , probably well armed , who might be considered a definite menace . Ogonyo had told them that this man was alone and probably lost , but they did not know whether or not to believe the headman . If Tarzan commandeered these forces , which Capietro knew he had the influence to do , they might expect an attack upon their village . By the light of several fires the blacks of the capturedsafari were compelled to break camp and , when the loads were packed , to carry them on the difficult night march toward Capietro 's village . With mounted sbiftas in advance , upon the flanks , and bringing up the rear there was no lagging and no chance to escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of his own porters , viewed the prospect of that night march with unmitigated disgust . He had traversed the route twice already since sunrise ; and the thought of doing it again , in the dark , with his hands tied behind him was far from cheering .

" " It is the work of Satan , " shrilled Timothy . " Do not let them weaken your heart with lies , Jobab . Do not let them pass ! " The elder was evidently under great mental and nervous strain .

" I hate to do it , " said Smith , half aloud , as he raised his pistol and aimed it at Jobab . The Apostle was directly in front of Lafayette Smith and little more than a yard distant when the American , aiming point blank at his chest , jerked the trigger and fired . An expression of surprise mingled with that of rage which had convulsed the unbecoming features of Jobab the Apostle . Lafayette Smith was also surprised and for the same reason  --  he had missed Jobab . It was174 TARZAN TRIUMPHANTp174incredible  --  there must be something wrong with the pistol ! But Jobab 's surprise , while based upon the same miracle , was of a loftier and nobler aspect . It was clothed in the sanctity of divine revelation .

Lafayette Smith was no weakling , and though his antagonist was inspired by a combination of maniacal fury and religious fanaticism the outcome of their struggle must have been a foregone conclusion had there been no outside influences to affect it . But there were . Beside the villagers , there was Lady Barbara Collis . With consternation she had witnessed the futility of Smith 's marksmanship ; and when she saw him disarmedand in the grip of Jobab , with others of the villagers rushing to his undoing , she realized that now , indeed , the lives of all three of them were in direct jeopardy . The pistol lay at her feet , but only for a second.  |p175Stoo|ping  , she seized it ; and then , with the blind desperationof self-preservation , she shoved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as he fell , a hideous shriek upon his lips , she turned the weapon upon the advancing villagers and fired again . It was enough . Screaming in terror , the Midians turned and fled . A wave of nausea swept over the girl ; she swayed and might have fallen had not Smith supported her . " I 'll be all right in a moment , " she said . " It was so horrible ! " " You were very brave , " said Lafayette Smith . " Not as brave as you , " she replied with a weak little smile ; " but a better shot . " " Oh , " cried Jezebel , " I thought they would have us again . Now that they are frightened , let us go away . t will require only a word from one of the apostles o send them upon us again . " " You are right , " agreed Smith . " Have you any elongings you wish to take with you ? " " Only what we wear , " replied Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the valley ? " askede man , on the chance that there might be another nd nearer avenue of escape than the fissure through hich he had come . " We know of no way out , " replied Jezebel . " Then follow me , " directed Smith . " I 'll take you ut the way I came in . " They made their way from the village and out ontothe dark plain toward Chinnereth , nor did they speak gain until they had gone some distance from the fires of the Midians and felt that they were safe from pursuit . It was then that Lafayette Smith asked a questionprompted by natural curiosity . " How can it be possible that you young ladies know of no way out of this valley ? " he asked . " Why ca n't you go out the way you came in ? " " I could scarcely do that , " replied Jezebel ; " I was born here . " " Born here ? " exclaimed Smith . " Then your parentsmust live in the valley . We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We just came from it , " explained Lady Barbara . " Jezebel was born in the village from which we , have just escaped . " " And those beasts killed her parents ? " demanded Lafayette . " You do not understand , " said Lady Barbara . " Those people are her people . " Smith was dumfounded . He almost ejaculated : " How horrible ! " but stayed the impulse . " And you ? " he asked presently . " Are they your people , too ? " There was a note of horror in his voice . " No , " replied Lady Barbara . " I am English . " " And you do n't know how you got into this valley ? " " Yes , I know  --  I came by parachute . " Smith halted and faced her . " You 're Lady Bar , bara Collis ! " he exclaimed . " How did you know ? " she asked . " Have you been searching for me ? " " No , but when I passed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your disappearance  --  pictures and things , you know . " " And you just stumbled onto me ? What a coincience1 And how fortunate for me . " " To tell you the truth , I am lost myself , " admitted mith . " So possibly you are about as badly off as you ere before . " " Scarcely , " she said . " You have at least prevented y premature cremation . " " They were really going to burn you ? It does n't em possible in this day and age of enlightenment and civilization . " " The Midians are two thousand years behind the mes , " she told him , " and in addition to that they are ligious , as well as congenital , maniacs . " Smith glanced in the direction of Jezebel whom he uld see plainly in the light of a full moon that had t just topped the eastern rim of the crater . Perhaps dy Barbara sensed the unspoken question that disrbedhim . " Jezebel is different , " she said . " I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like her people . She tells me at occasionally one such as she is born among them . " " But she speaks English , " said Smith . " She can not of the same blood as the people I saw in the village , hose language is certainly not the same as hers , to y nothing of the dissimilarity of their physical ap-pearance . " " I taught her English , " explained Lady Barbara . " She wants to go away and leave her parents and r people ? " asked Smith.  | " Of course I do , " said Jezebel . " Why should I want to stay here and be murdered ? My father , my mother , my brothers and sisters were in that crowd you saw about the crosses tonight . They hate me . They have hated me from the day I was born , because I am not like them . But then there is no love in the land of Midian  --  only religion , which preaches love and practices hate . " Smith fell silent as the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chinnereth . He was considering the responsibility that Fate had loaded upon his shoulders so unexpectedly and wondering if he were equal to the emergency , who , as he was becoming to realize , could scarcely be sure of his ability to insure his own existence in this savage and unfamiliarworld . Keenly the realization smote him that in almost thirty hours that he had been thrown exclusively upon his own resources he had discovered not a single opportunity to provide food for himself , the result of which was becoming increasingly apparent in a noticeable loss of strength and endurance . What then might he hope to accomplish with two additional mouths to feed ? And what if they encountered either savage beasts or unfriendly natives ? Lafayette Smith shuddered . " I hope they can run fast , " he murmured . " Who ? " asked Lady Barbara . " What do you mean ? " " Oh , " stammered Lafayette . " I  --  I did not know that I spoke aloud . " How could he tell her that he had lost confidence even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life had he felt so utterly incompetent . His futility seemed to him to border on criminality . At any rate it was dishonorable , since it was deceiving these young women who had a right to expect guidance and protection from him . He was very bitter toward himself ; but that , perhaps , was due partly to the nervous reaction following the rather horrible experience at the village and physicalweakness that was bordering on exhaustion . He was excoriating himself for having dismissed Obambi , which act , he realized , was at the bottom of all his troubles ; and then he recalled that had it not been for that there would have been no one to save these two girls from the horrible fate from which he had preservedthem . This thought somewhat restored his self-esteem , for he could not escape the fact that he had , after all , saved them . Jezebel , the circulation restored to her feet , had been walking without assistance for some time . The three had lapsed into a long silence , each occupied with his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opening into the fissure . A full African moon lighted their way , its friendly beams lessening the difficulties of the night march . Chinnereth lay upon their right , a vision of loveliness in the moonlight , while all about them the grim mass of the crater walls seemed to have closed in upon them and to hang menacingly above their heads , for night and moonlight play strange tricks with perspective . It was shortly after midnight that Smith first stumbledand fell . He arose quickly , berating his awk/wardness ; but as he proceeded , Jezebel , who was directlybehind him , noticed that he walked unsteadily , stumbling more and more often . Presently he fell again , and this time it was apparent to both girls that it was only with considerable effort that he arose . The third time he fell they both helped him to his feet . " I 'm terribly clumsy , " he said . He was swaying slightly as he stood between them . Lady Barbara observed him closely . " You are exhausted , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm all right . " " When did you eat last ? " demanded the girl . " I had some chocolate with me , " replied Smith . " I ate the last of it this afternoon sometime . " " When did you eat a meal , I mean ? " persisted Lady Barbara . " Well , " he admitted , " I had a light lunch yesterday noon , or rather day before yesterday . It must be after midnight now . " " And you have been walking all the time since ? " " Oh , I ran part of the time , " he replied , with a weak laugh . " That was when the lion chased me . And I slept in the afternoon before I came to the village . " " We are going to stop right here until you are rested , " announced the English girl . " Oh , no , " he demurred , " we must n't do that . I want to get you out of this valley before daylight , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " " I do n't think so , " said Jezebel . " They are toop181much afraid of the North Midians to come this far from the village ; and , anyway , we have such a start that we can reach the cliffs , where you say the fissure is , before they could overtake us . " " You must rest , " insisted Lady Barbara . Reluctantly Lafayette sat down . " I 'm afraid I 'm not going to be much help to you , " he said . " You see I am not really familiar with Africa , and I fear that I am not adequately armed for your protection . I wish Danny were here . " " Who is Danny ? " asked Lady Barbara . " He 's a friend who accompanied me on this trip . " " He 's had African experience ? " " No , " admitted Lafayette , " but one always feels safe with Danny about . He seems so familiar with firearms . You see he is a protection guy . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " To be quite candid , " replied Lafayette , " I am not at all sure that I know myself what it is . Danny is not exactly garrulous about his past ; and I have hesitatedto pry into his private affairs , but he did volunteerthe information one day that he had been a protectionguy for a big shot . It sounded reassuring . " " What is a big shot ? " inquired Jezebel . " Perhaps a big game hunter , " suggested Lady Barbara . " No , " said Lafayette . " I gather from Danny 's remarksthat a big shot is a rich brewer or distiller who also assists in directing the affairs of a large city . It may be just another name for political boss . " " Of course , " said Lady Barbara , " it would be nicep182if your friend were here ; but he is not , so suppose you tell us something about yourself . Do you realize that we do not even know your name ? " Smith laughed . " That 's about all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's Lafayette Smith , and now will you introduce me to this other young lady ? I already know who you are . " " Oh , this is Jezebel , " said Lady Barbara . There was a moment 's silence . " Is that all ? " asked Smith . Lady Barbara laughed . " Just Jezebel , " she said . " If we ever get out of here we 'll have to find a surnamefor her . They do n't use ' em in the land of Midian . " Smith lay on his back looking up at the moon . Alreadyhe was commencing to feel the beneficial effects of relaxation and rest . His thoughts were toying with the events of the past thirty hours . What an adventurefor a prosaic professor , of geology , he thought . He had never been particularly interested in girls , although he was far from being a misogynist , and to find himself thus thrown into the intimate relationship of protector to two beautiful young women was somewhatdisconcerting . And the moon had revealed that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell . He had heard of such things and he wondered . But sunlight could not alter the cool , crisp , well bred voice of Lady Barbara Collis . He liked to hear her talk . He had always enjoyed the accent and diction of cultured English folk . He tried to think of something to ask her that hep183might listen to her voice again . That raised the question of just how he should address her . His contacts with nobility had been few  --  in fact almost restricted to a single Russian prince who had been a door man at a restaurant he sometimes patronized , and he had never heard him addressed otherwise than as Mike . He thought Lady Barbara would be the correct formula , though that smacked a little of familiarity . Lady Collis seemed , somehow , even less appropriate . He wished he were sure . Mike would never do . Jezebel . What an archaic name l And then he fell asleep . Lady Barbara looked down at him and raised a warning finger to her lips lest Jezebel awaken him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beckoning the golden . one to follow . " He is about done up , " she whispered , as they seated themselves again . " Poor chap , he has had a rough time of it . Imagine being chased by a lion with only that little pop-gun with which to defend oneself . " " Is he from your country ? " asked Jezebel . " No , he 's an American . I can tell by his accent . " " He is very beautiful , " said Jezebel , with a sigh . " After looking at Abraham , the son of Abraham , and Jobab , for all these weeks I could agree with you if you insisted that St. Ghandi is an Adonis , " replied Lady Barbara . " I do not know what you mean , " said Jezebel ; " but do you not think him beautiful ? " " I am less interested in his pulchritude than in his marksmanship , and that is positively beastly . He'sp184got sand though , my word ! no end . He walked right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noses of hundreds of people with nothing but his little peashooterfor protection . That , Jezebel , was top hole . " The golden Jezebel sighed . " He is much more beautiful than the men of the land of North Midian , " she said . Lady Barbara looked at her companion for a long minute ; then she sighed . " If I ever get you to civilization , " she said , " I 'm afraid you are going to prove something of a problem . " Wherewith she stretched herself upon the ground and was soon asleep , for she , too , had had a strenuous day.  | THE sun shining on his upturned face awakened Lafayette Smith . At first he had difficulty in collectinghis thoughts . The events of the previous night appeared as a dream , but when he sat up and discovered the figures of the sleeping girls a short distance from him his mind was jerked rudely back into the world of realities . His heart sank . How was he to acquit himself creditably of such a responsibility ? Frankly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he could find the fissure and lead his charges to the outer world , but how much better off would they be then ? He had no idea now , and he realized that he never had , where his camp lay . Then there was the possibility of meeting the lion again in the fissure , and if they did not there was still the question of sustenance . What were they going to use for food , and how were they going to get it ? The thought of food awoke a gnawing hunger within him . He arose and walked to the shore of the lake where he lay on his belly and filled himself with water . When he stood up the girls were sitting up looking at him.  | " Good morning , " he greeted them . " I was just having breakfast . Will you join me ? " They returned his salutation as they arose and came toward him . Lady Barbara was smiling . " Thank the lord , you have a sense of humor , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it before we get out of this . " " I would much prefer ham and eggs , " he replied ruefully . " Now I know you 're an American , " she said . " I suppose you are thinking of tea and marmalade , " he rejoined . " I am trying not to think of food at all , " she replied . " Have some lake , " he suggested . " You have no idea how satisfying it is if you take enough of it . " After the girls had drunk the three set off again , led by Smith , in search of the opening to the fissure . " I know just where it is , " he had assured them the night before , and even now he thought that he would have little difficulty in finding it , but when they approached the base of the cliff at the point where he had expected to find it it was not there . Along the foot of the beetling escarpment he searched , almost frantically now , but there was no sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley of the land of Midian . Finally , crushed , he faced Lady Barbara . " I can not find it , " he admitted , and there was a quality of hopelessness in his voice that touched her . " Never mind , " she said . " It must be somewhere.  |p187We  shall just have to keep searching until we find it . " " But it 's so hard on you young ladies , " he said . " It must be a bitter disappointment to you . You do n't know how it makes me feel to realize that , with no one to depend on but me , I have failed you so miser-ably . " " Do n't take it that way , please , " she begged . " Anyonemight have lost his bearings in this hole . These cliffs scarcely change their appearance in miles . " " It 's kind of you to say that , but I can not help but feel guilty . Yet I know the opening can not be far from here . I came in on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we are now . Yes , I 'm sure I must find it eventually ; but there is no need for all of us to search . You and Jezebel sit down here and wait while I look for it . " " I think we should remain together , " suggested Jezebel . " By all means , " agreed Lady Barbara . " As you wish , " said Smith . " We will search toward the north as far as it is possible that the opening can lie . If we do n't find it we can come back here and search toward the south . " As they moved along the base of the cliff in a northerly direction Smith became more and more convincedthat he was about to discover the entrance to the fissure . He thought that he discerned something familiar in the outlook across the valley from this location , but still no opening revealed itself after they had gone a considerable distance . Presently , as they climbed the rise and gained thep188summit of one of the numerous low ridges that ran , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the valley , he halted in discouragement . " What is it ? " asked Jezebel . " That forest , " he replied . " There was no forest in sight of the opening . " Before them spread an open forest of small trees that grew almost to the foot of the cliffs and stretched downward to the shore of the lake , forming a landscapeof exceptional beauty in its park-like aspect . But Lafayette Smith saw no beauty there  --  he saw only another proof of his inefficiency and ignorance . " You came through no forest on your way from the cliffs to the village ? " demanded Lady Barbara . He shook his head . " We 've got to walk all the way back now , " he said , " and search in the other direction . It is most disheartening . I wonder if you can forgive me . " " Do n't be silly , " said Lady Barbara . " One might think that you were a Cook 's Tour courier who had got lost during a personally conducted tour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job in con-sequence . " " I feel worse than that , " Smith admitted with a laugh , " and I imagine that 's saying a lot . " " Look ! " exclaimed Lady Barbara . " There are animals of some sort down there in the forest . Do n't you see them ? " " Oh , yes , " cried Jezebel , " I see them . " " What are they ? " asked Smith . " They look like deer . "  | " They are goats , " said Jezebel . " The North Midians have goats . They roam over this end of the valley . " " They look like something to eat , to me , " said Lady Barbara . " Let 's go down and get one of them . " " They will probably not let us catch them , " suggestedLafayette . " You 've a pistol , " the English girl reminded him . " That 's a fact , " he agreed . " I can shoot one . " " Maybe , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , " said Smith . " Three of us together might frighten them . " " You 'll have to be mighty careful or you 'll frighten them yourself , " warned Lady Barbara . " Have you ever stalked game ? " " No , " admitted the American , " I never have . " Lady Barbara moistened a finger and held it up . " The wind is right , " she announced . " So all you have to do is keep out of sight and make no noise . " " How am I going to keep out of sight ? " demanded Smith . " You 'll have to crawl down to them , taking advantage of trees , rocks and bushes  --  anything that will conceal you . Crawl forward a few feet and then stop , if they show any sign of nervousness , until they appearunconcerned again . " " That will take a long time , " said Smith . " It may be a long time before we find anything else to tat , " she reminded him , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us and lie down and die at our feet . "  | " I suppose you are right , " assented Smith . " Here goes ! Pray for me . " He dropped to his hands and knees and crawled slowly forward over the rough ground in the direction of the forest and the goats . After a few yards he turned and whispered : " This is going to be tough on the knees . " " Not half as hard as it 's going to be on our stomachsif you do n't succeed , " replied Lady Barbara . Smith made a wry face and resumed his crawling while the two girls , lying flat now to conceal themselves from the quarry , watched his progress . " He 's not doing half badly , " commented Lady Barbara after several minutes of silent watching . " How beautiful he is , " sighed Jezebel . " Just at present the most beautiful things in the landscape are those goats , " said Lady Barbara . " If he gets close enough for a shot and misses I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He did n't miss Lamech last night , " Jezebel remindedher . " He must have been aiming at someone else , " commentedLady Barbara shortly . Lafayette Smith crawled on apace . With numerous halts , as advised by Lady Barbara , he drew slowly nearer his unsuspecting quarry . The minutes seemed hours . Pounding constantly upon his brain was the consciousness that he must not fail , though not for the reason that one might naturally assume . The failure to procure food seemed a less dreadful consequence than the contempt of Lady Barbara Collis . Now , at last , he was quite close to the nearest of thep191herd . Just a few more yards and he was positive that he could not miss . A low bush , growing just ahead of him , concealed his approach from the eyes of his victim . Lafayette Smith reached the bush and paused behind it . A little farther ahead he discovered another shrub still closer to the goat , a thin nanny with a large udder . She did not look very appetizing , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidden juicy steaks and cutlets . He crawled on . His knees were raw and his neck ached from the unnatural position his unfamiliar method of locomotion had compelled it to assume . He passed the bush behind which he had paused , failing to see the kid lying hidden upon its opposite side  --  hidden by a solicitous mamma while she fed . The kid saw Lafayette but it did not move . It would not move until its mother called it , unless actually touched by something , or terrified beyond the limit of its self control . It watched Lafayette crawling toward the next bush upon his itinerary  --  the next and last . What it thought is unrecorded , but it is doubtful that it was impressed by Lafayette 's beauty . Now the man had reached the concealment of the last bush , unseen by any other eyes than those of the kid . He drew his pistol cautiously , lest the slightest noise alarm his potential dinner . Raising himself slightly until his eyes were above the level of the bush he took careful aim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a remote contingency as to be of negligible consideration.  |p192Lafayette  already felt the stirring warmth of pride with which he would toss the carcass of his kill at the feet of Lady Barbara and Jezebel . Then he jerked the trigger . Nanny leaped straight up into the air , and when she hit the ground again she was already streaking north in company with the balance of the herd . Lafayette Smith had missed again . He had scarcely time to realize the astounding and humiliating fact as he rose to his feet when something struck him suddenly and heavily from behind  --  a blow that bent his knees beneath him and brought him heavily to earth in a sitting posture . No , not to earth . He was sitting on something soft that wriggled and squirmed . His startled eyes , glancing down , saw the head of a kid protruding from between his legs  --  little Capra hircus had been terrified beyond the limit of his self-control . " Missed ! " cried Lady Barbara Collis . " How could he ! " Tears of disappointment welled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the northern fringe of the forest cocked his ears and listened . That unfamiliarsound ! And so near . From far across the valley , toward the village of the South Midians , Eshbaal had heard a similar sound , though faintly from afar , the night before . Four times it had broken the silence of the valley and no more . Eshbaal had heard it and so had his fellows in the village of Elija , the son of Noah . Lafayette Smith seized the kid before it could wriggle free , and despite its struggles he slung it acrossp193his shoulder and started back toward the waiting girls . " He did n't miss it ! " exclaimed Jezebel . " I knew he would n't , " and she went down to meet him , with Lady Barbara , perplexed , following in her wake . " Splendid ! " cried the English girl as they came closer . " You really did shoot one , did n't you ? I was sure you missed . " " I did miss , " admitted Lafayette ruefully . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must admit it , " explained the man , " I sat on . As a matter of fact it got me . " " Well , anyway , you have it , " she said . " And it will be a whole lot better eating than the one I missed , " he assured them . " That one was terriblythin and very old . " " How cute it is , " said Jezebel . " Do n't , " cried Lady Barbara . " We must n't think f that . Just remember that we are starving . " " Where shall we eat it ? " asked Smith . " Right here , " replied the English girl . " There is lenty of deadwood around these trees . Have you arches ? " " Yes . Now you two look the other way while I o my duty . I wish I 'd hit the old one now . This is like murdering a baby . " Upon the opposite side of the forest Eshbaal was nee again experiencing surprise , for suddenly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The strange noise frightened them , " soliloquized Eshbaal . " Perhaps it is a miracle . The goats forp194which I have searched all day have been made to return unto me . " As they dashed past , the trained eye of the shepherd took note of them . There were not many goats in the bunch that had strayed , so he had no difficulty in counting them . A kid was missing . Being a shepherd there was nothing for Eshbaal to do but set forth in search of the missing one . He advanced cautiously , alert because of the noise that he had heard . Eshbaal was a short , stocky man with blue eyes and a wealth of blond hair and beard . His features were regular and handsome in a primitive , savage way . His single garment , fashioned from a goat skin , left his right arm entirely free , nor did it impede his legs , since it fell not to his knees . He carried a club and a rude knife . Lady Barbara took charge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , beyond hard boiling eggs , his knowledge of cookingwas too sketchy to warrant serious mention . " And anyway , " he said , " we have n't any eggs . " Following the directions of the English girl , Smith cut a number of chops from the carcass ; and these the three grilled on pointed sticks that Lady Barbara had had him cut from a nearby tree . " How long will it take to cook them ? " demanded ' Smith . " I could eat mine raw . I could eat the whole kid raw , for that matter , in one sitting and have room left for the old nanny I missed . " " We 'll eat only enough to keep us going , " said Lady Barbara ; " then we 'll wrap the rest in the skinp195and take it with us . If we 're careful , this should keep us alive for three or four days . " " Of course you 're right , " admitted Lafayette . " You always are . " " You can have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " because you 've been longer without food than we . " " You have had nothing for a long time , Barbara , " said Jezebel . " I am the one who needs the least . " " We all need it now , " said Lafayette . " Let 's have  --  good meal this time , get back our strength , and then ration the balance so that it will last several days . Maybe I will sit on something else before this is gone . " They all laughed ; and presently the chops were done , and the three fell to upon them . " Like starving Armenians , " was the simile Smith suggested . Occupied with the delightful business of appeasing woolfish hunger , none of them saw Eshbaal halt behind a tree and observe them . Jezebel he recognized for what she was , and a sudden fire lighted his blue eyes . The others were enigmas to him  --  especially their strange apparel . Of one thing Eshbaal was convinced . He had found his lost kid and there was wrath in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three ; then he glided back into the forest until he was out of their sight , when he broke into a run . The meal finished , Smith wrapped the remainder of he carcass in the skin of the kid ; and the three again ook up their search for the fissure . An hour passed and then another . Still their efforts were not crowned with success . They saw nop196opening in the stern , forbidding face of the escarpment , nor did they see the slinking figures creeping steadily nearer and nearer  --  a score of stocky , yellow haired men led by Eshbaal , the Shepherd . " We must have passed it , " said Smith at last . " It just can not be this far south , " yet only a hundred yards farther on lay the illusive opening into the great fissure . " We shall have to hunt for some other way out of the valley then , " said Lady Barbara . " There is a place farther south that Jezebel and I used to see from the mouth of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scaled . " " Let 's have a try at it then , " said Smith . " Say , look there ! " he pointed toward the north . " What is it ? Where ? " demanded Jezebel . " I thought I saw a man 's head behind that rock , " said Smith . " Yes , there he is again . Lord , look at ' em . They 're all around . " Eshbaal and his fellows , realizing that they were discovered , came into the open , advancing slowly toward the three . " The men of North Midian ! " exclaimed Jezebel . " Are they not beautiful ! " " What shall we do ? " demanded Lady Barbara . " We must not let them take us . " " We 'll see what they want , " said Smith . " They may not be unfriendly . Anyway , we could n't escape them by running . They would overtake us in no time . Get behind me , and if they show any signs of attack  --  ing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps you had better go out and sit on them , " suggested Lady Barbara , wearily . " I am sorry , " said Smith , " that my marksmanship is so poor ; but , unfortunately perhaps , it never occurredto my parents to train me in the gentle art of murder . I realize now that they erred and that my education has been sadly neglected . I am only a school teacher , and in teaching the young intellect to shoot I have failed to learn to do so myself . " " I did n't intend to be nasty , " said Lady Barbara , who detected in the irony of the man 's reply a suggestion of wounded pride . " Please forgive me . " The North Midians were advancing cautiously , halting occasionally for brief , whispered conferences . Presently one of them spoke , addressing the three . " Who are you ? " he demanded . " What do you in the land of Midian ? " " Can you understand him ? " asked Smith , over his shoulder . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaks the same language as Jezebel 's people , " explained Lady Barbara . " He wants to know who we are and what we are doing here . " " You talk to him , Lady Barbara , " said Smith . The English girl stepped forward . " We are strangers in Midian , " she said . " We are lost . All we wish is to get out of your country . " " There is no way out of Midian , " replied the man . " You have killed a kid belonging to Eshbaal . Forthat you must be punished . You must come with us . " " We were starving , " explained Lady Barbara . " Ifp198we could pay for the kid we would gladly do so . Let us go in peace . " The Midians held another whispered conference , after which their spokesman addressed the three again . " You must come with us , " he said , " the women at least . If the man will go away we will not harm you , we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What did he say ? " demanded Smith , and when Lady Barbara had interpreted he shook his head . " Tell them no , " he directed . " Also tell them that if they molest us I shall have to kill them . " When the girl delivered this ultimatum to the Midians they laughed . " What can one man do against twenty ? " demanded their leader , then he advancedfollowed by his retainers . They were brandishingtheir clubs now , and some of them raised their voices in a savage war cry . " You will have to shoot , " said Lady Barbara . " There are at least twenty . You can not miss them all . " " You flatter me , " said Smith , as he raised his .32 and levelled it at the advancing Midians . " Go back ! " shouted Jezebel , " or you will be killed , " but the attackers only came forward the faster . Then Smith fired . At the sharp crack of the pistol the Midians halted , surprised ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club , quickly and accurately , just as Smith was about to fire again . He dodged ; but the missile struck his pistol hand a glancingblow , sending the weapon flying  --  then the North Midians were upon them.  |p200and  placed an ear against the ground . " Horses and men , " he soliloquized as he rose to his feet . Standingerect , his great chest rising and falling to his breathing , he listened intently . His sensitive nostrils , seeking to confirm the testimony of his ears , dilated to receive and classify the messages that Usha , the wind , bore to them . They caught the scent of Tongani , the baboon , so strong as almost to negate the others . Tenuous , from a great distance came the scent spoor of Sabor , the lioness , and the sweet , heavy stench of Tantor , the elephant . One by one the apemanread these invisible messages brought by Usha , the wind ; but only those interested him that spoke of horses and men . Why did horses and men move through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely needed to ask himself that latter question , and only the first one interested him . It is the business of beasts and of men to know what their enemies do . Tarzan stretched his great muscles lazily and moved down the slope of the foot hills in the direction from which had come the evidence that his enemies were afoot . The " Gunner " stumbled along in the darkness . Never in his twenty odd years of life had he even approximated such utter physical exhaustion . Each step he was sure must be his last . He had long since become too tired even to curse his captors as he plodded on , now almost numb to any sensation , his mind a chaos of dull misery . But even endless journeys must ultimately end ; andp201at last the cavalcade turned into the gateway of the village of Dominic Capietro , the raider ; and the " Gunner " was escorted to a hut where he slumped to the hard earth floor after his bonds had been removed , positive that he would never rise again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aroused himself long enough to eat , for his hunger was fully as great as his fatigue . Then he stretched out again and slept , while a tired and disgusted shifta nodded drowsily on guard outside the entrance to the hut . Tarzan had come down to the cliff above the village as the raiders were filing through the gateway . A full moon cast her revealing beams upon the scene , lightingthe figures of horses and men . The ape-man recognizedCapietro and Stabutch , he saw Ogonyo , the headmanof the safari of the young American geologist ; and he saw the " Gunner " stumbling painfully along in bonds . The ape-man was an interested spectator of all that transpired in the village below . He noted particularly the location of the hut into which the white prisoner had been thrust . He watched the preparation of food , and he noted the great quantities of liquor that Capietroand Stabutch consumed while waiting for the midnightsupper being prepared by slaves . The more they drank the better pleased was Tarzan . As he watched them , he wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term of reproach and man one of glorification . The beasts , as he knew , held an opposite conception of thep202relative virtues of these two orders , although they were ignorant of most of man 's asininities and degradations , their minds being far too pure to understand them . Waiting with the patience of the unspoiled primitive nervous system , Tarzan watched from the cliff top until the village below seemed to have settled down for the night . He saw the sentries in the banquette inside the palisade , but he did not see the guard squattingin the shadow of the hut where the " Gunner " lay in heavy slumber . Satisfied , the ape-man rose and moved along the cliff until he was beyond the village ; and there , where the escarpment was less precipitous , he made his way to its base . Noiselessly and cautiously he crept to the palisade at a point that was hidden from the view of the sentries . The moon shone full upon him , but the opposite side of the palisade he knew must be in dense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself that his approach had aroused no suspicion . He wished that he might see the sentries at the gate , for when he topped the palisade he would be in full view for an instant . When last he had seen them they had been squatting upon the banquette , their backs to the palisade , and apparently upon the verge of sleep . Would they remain thus ? Here , however , was a chance he must take , and so he gave the matter little thought and few regrets . What was , was ; and if he could not change it he must ignore it ; and so , leaping lightly upward , he seized the top of the palisade and drew himself up and over.  |p203Only  a glance he threw in the direction of the sentries as he topped the barrier , a glance that told him they had not moved since he had last looked . In the shadow of the palisade he paused to look about . There was nothing to cause him apprehension ; and so he moved quickly , keeping ever in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he expected to find the young white man . It was hidden from his view by another hut which he approached and had circled when he saw the figure of the guard sitting by the doorway , his rifle across his knees . This was a contingency the ape-man had not anticipated , and it caused a change in his immediate plans . He drew back out of sight behind the hut he had been circling , lay down flat upon the ground , and then crawled forward again until his head protruded beyond the hut far enough to permit one eye to watch the unconscious guard . Here he lay waiting  --  a humanbeast watching its quarry . For a long time he lay thus trusting to his knowledge of men that the moment for which he waited would arrive . Presently the chin of the shi f to dropped to his chest ; but immediately it snapped back again , erect . Then the fellow changed his position . Ile sat upon the ground , his legs stretched before him , and leaned his back against the hut . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous position for a man who would remain awake . After a while his head rolled to one side . Tarzan watched him closely , as a cat watches a mouse . The head remained in the position to which it had rolled ,  |p204the  chin dropped , and the mouth gaped ; the tempo of the breathing changed , denoting sleep . Tarzan rose silently to his feet and as silently crept across the intervening space to the side of the unconscious man . There must be no outcry , no scuffle . As strikes Histah , the snake , so struck Tarzan of the Apes . There was only the sound of parting vertebraeas the neck broke in the grip of those thews of steel . The rifle Tarzan laid upon the ground ; then he raised the corpse in his arms and bore it into the darkness of the hut 's interior . Here he groped for a momentuntil he had located the body of the sleeping white , and knelt beside him . Cautiously he shook him , one hand ready to muffle any outcry the man might make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tarzan shook him again more roughly and yet without results , then he slapped him heavily across the face . The " Gunner " stirred . " Geeze , " he muttered " ca n't you let a guy sleep ? Did n't I tell you you 'd get your ransom , you damn wop ? " Tarzan permitted a faint smile to touch his lips . " Wake up , " he whispered . " Make no noise . I have come to take you away ? " " Who are you ? " " Tarzan of the Apes . " " Geeze 1 " The " Gunner " sat up . " Make no noise , " cautioned the ape-man once more . " Sure , " whispered Danny as he raised himself stiffly to his feet . " Follow me , " said Tarzan , " and no matter whatp205happens stay very close to me . I am going to toss you to the top of the palisade . Try not to make any noise as you climb over , and be careful when you drop to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flexed  --  it is a long drop . " " You say you 're going to toss me to the top of the palisade , guy ? " " Yes . " " Do you know what I weigh ? " " No , and I do n't care . Keep still and follow me . Do n't stumble over this body . " Tarzan paused in the entrance and looked about ; then he passed out , with the " Gunner " at his heels , and crossed quickly o the palisade . Even if they discovered him now he still had time to accomplish what he had set out to do , cfore they could interfere , unless the sentries , firing them , chanced to make a hit ; but on that score felt little apprehension . As they came to the palisade the " Gunner " glanced p , and his skepticism increased  --  a fat chance any y would have to toss his one hundred and eighty ounds to the top of that ' The ape-man seized him by the collar and the seat f his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . hen he swung the " Gunner " backward as thoughe had been a fifty pound sack of meal , surged forardand upward ; and in the same second Danny Patrick'soutstretched fingers clutched the top of the alisade . " Geeze , " he muttered , " if I 'd missed I 'd of gone can over . "  | Catlike , the ape-man ran up the barrier and dropped to the ground on the outside almost at the instant thatthe " Gunner " alighted , and without a word started toward the cliff , where once again he had to assist theother to reach the summit . Danny " Gunner " Patrick was speechless , partlyfrom shortness of breath following his exertions , butmore , by far , from astonishment . Here was a guy ! In all his experience of brawny men , and it had been considerable , he had never met , nor expected to meet , such a one as this . " I have located the spoor of your friend , " saidTarzan . " The what ? " asked the " Gunner . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " explained the ape-man , who was stillleading the way up the slope toward the higher mountains . " I gotcha , " said the " Gunner . " " But you ai nt seenhim ? " " No , it was too dark to follow him when I foundthem . We will do so in the morning . " " If I can walk , " said the " Gunner . " " What 's the matter with you ? " demanded Tarzan . " Injured ? " " I ai nt got no legs from the knees down , " repliedDanny . " I walked my lousy dogs off yesterday . " " I 'll carry you , " suggested Tarzan . " Nix ! " exclaimed Danny . " I can crawl , but I 'll bedamned if I 'll let any guy carry me . " " It will be a hard trip if you 're exhausted now , " theape-man told him . " I could leave you somewhere nearp207here and pick you up after I find your friend . " " Nothing doing . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em off to the hips . " " I could probably travel faster alone , " suggested Tarzan . " Go ahead , " agreed the " Gunner " cheerfully . " I 'll tail along behind you . " " And get lost . " " Let me come along , mister . I 'm worried about that crazy nut . " " All right . It wo n't " make much difference anytray . He may be a little hungrier when we find him , ut he ca n't starve to death in a couple of days . " " Say , " exclaimed Danny , " how come you knew cm Wops had taken me for a ride ? " " I thought you walked . " " Well , what 's the difference ? How did you know was in that lousy burgh of theirs ? " " I was on the cliff when they brought you in . I aited until they were asleep . I am not ready to eal with them yet . " " What you goin ' to do to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long me they walked on in silence through the night , the c-man timing his speed to the physical condition of ' s companion , whose nerve he was constrained to mire , though his endurance and knowledge he viewed ith contempt . Far up in the hills , where he had bedded down rlier in the night , Tarzan halted and told the runner " to get what rest he could before dawn.  | " Geeze , them 's the pleasantest words I 've heard for years , " sighed Danny , as he lay down in the high grass . " You may think you 've seen a guy pound his ear , but you ai nt seen nothin ' . Watch me , " and he was asleep almost before the words had left his mouth . Tarzan lay down at a little distance ; and he , too , was soon asleep , but at the first suggestion of dawn he was up . He saw that his companion still slept , and then he slipped silently away toward a water hole he had discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he had met the tribe of Zugash , the tongani . He kept well down the slope of the foot hills , for with the coming of dawn the wind had changed , and he wished to come up wind toward the water hole . He moved as silently as the disappearing shadows of the retreating night , his nostrils quivering to catch each vagrant scent borne upon the bosom of the early morning breeze . There was deep mud at one edge of the water hole , where the earth had been trampled by the feet of drinking beasts ; and near here he found that which he sought , the sticky sweetness of whose scent had been carried to his nostrils by Usha . Low trees grew in the bottom of the ravine and much underbrush , for here the earth held its moisture longer than on the ridges that were more exposed to Kudu 's merciless rays . It was a lovely sylvan glade nor did its beauties escape the appreciative eyes of the ape-man , though the lure of the glade lay not thisp209morning in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbored Horta , the boar . Silently , to the edge of the underbrush came the apemanas Horta came down to the pool to drink . Upon the opposite side stood Tarzan , his bow and arrows ready in his hands ; but the high brush precluded a fair shot , and so the hunter stepped out in full view of the boar . So quickly he moved that his arrow sped as Horta wheeled to run , catching the boar in the side behind the left shoulder  --  a vital spot . With a snort of rage Horta turned back and charged . Straight through the pool he came for Tartan ; and as he came three more arrows , shot with unbelievable accuracy and celerity , buried themselves deep in the breast of the great beast . Bloody foam flecked his jowls and his flashing tusks , fires of hate shot from his wicked little eyes as he sought to reach the author of his hurts and wreak his vengeance beorehe died . Discarding his bow the ape-man met the mad charge f Horta with his spear , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that great body , hemmed , as he was , by the thick growth of underbrush . His feet ' raced , he dropped the point of his weapon the intantHorta was within its range , that he might have o opportunity to dodge it or strike it aside with histusks . Straight through the great chest it drove , deep into the savage heart , yet the beast still strove to reach the man-thing that held it off with a strength almost qual to its own . But already as good as dead on his feet was Horta ,  | the boar . His brief , savage struggles ended ; and he dropped in the shallow water at the edge of the pool . Then the ape-man placed a foot upon his vanquished foe and screamed forth the hideous challenge of histribe . The " Gunner " sat suddenly erect , awakened out of a sound sleep . " Geeze ! " he exclaimed . " What was that ? " Receiving no answer he looked about . " Would n't that eat you ? " he murmured . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on me ? He did n't seem like that kind of a guy . But you ca n't never tell  --  I 've had pals to double-cross me before this . " In the village of Capietro a dozing sentry snapped suddenly alert , while his companion half rose to his feet . " What was that ? " demanded one . " A hairy one has made a kill , " said the other . Sheeta , the panther , down wind , stalking both the man and the boar , stopped in his tracks ; then he turned aside and loped away in easy , graceful bounds ; but he had not gone far before he stopped again and raised his nose up-wind . Again the scent of man ; bu  --  this time a different man , nor was there any sign o the feared thunder stick that usually accompanied th scent spoor of the tarmangani . Belly low , Sheet moved slowly up the slope toward Danny " Gunner ' Patrick . " What to do ? " mused the " Gunner . " " Geeze , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should I go on On , where ? I sure got myself in a jam all righ Where do I go ? How do I eat ? Hell ! " He arose and moved about , feeling out his musclesp211They were lame and sore , but he realized that he was much rested . Then he scanned the distances for a sight of Tarzan and , instead , saw Sheeta , the panther , a few hundred yards away . Danny Patrick , hoodlum , racketeer , gangster , gunman , killer , trembled in terror . Cold sweat burst from very pore , and he could feel the hair rise on his scalp . He felt a mad impulse to run ; but , fortunately for Danny , his legs refused to move . He was literally , in the vernacular to which he was accustomed , scared stiff . The " Gunner , " without a gun , was a very differentman . The panther had stopped and was surveying him . Caution and an hereditary fear of man gave the great tat pause ; but he was angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunting futilely all bight , and he was very , very hungry . He growled , his face wrinkled in a hideous snarl ; and Danny felt his knees giving beneath him . Then , beyond the panther , he saw the high grassoving to the approach of another animal , whiche " Gunner " promptly assumed was the beast 's mate. here was just a single , narrow strip of this high grass ; and when the animal had crossed it he , too , w mild see Danny , who was confident that this would %ell the end . One of them might hesitate to attackman  --  he did n't know  --  but he was sure that two m mild not . He dropped to his knees and did something that c had not done for many years  --  he prayed . And then the grasses parted ; and Tarzan of the Apesp212stepped into view , the carcass of a boar upon one broad shoulder . Instantly the ape-man took in the scene that his nostrils had already prepared him for . Dropping the carcass of Horta he voiced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it did Danny Patrick . The cat wheeled , instantly on the defensive . Tarzan charged , growls rumbling from his throat ; and Sheeta did exactly what he had as . sumed he would do  --  turned and fled . Then Tarzan picked up the carcass of Horta and came up the slope to Danny , who knelt open-mouthed and petrified . " What are you kneeling for ? " asked the ape-man . " I was just tying my boot lace , " explained , the " Gunner . " " Here is breakfast , " said Tarzan , dropping the boar to the ground . " Help yourself . " " That sure looks good to me , " said Danny . " could eat it raw . " " That is fine , " said Tarzan ; and , squatting , he cu two strips from one of the hams . " Isere , " he said offering one to the " Gunner . " " Quit your kidding , " remonstrated the latter . Tarzan eyed him questioningly , at the same tim tearing off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Horta is a little bit tough , " he remarked " but he is the best I could do without losing a great deal of time . Why do n't you eat ? I thought yo , were hungry . " " I got to cook mine , " said the " Gunner . " " But you said you could eat it raw , " the ape-ma reminded him.  | " That 's just a saying , " explained the " Gunner . " " I might at that , but I ai nt never tried it . " " Make a fire , then ; and cook yours , " said Tarzan . " Say , " remarked Danny a few minutes later as he squatted before his fire grilling his meat , " did you hear that noise a little while ago ? " " What was it like ? " " I never heard nothing like it but once before  --  say I just took a tumble to myself ! That was you killin ' the pig . I heard you yell like that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We will be going as soon as you finish your meat , " aid Tarzan . He was hacking off several pieces , half f which he handed to the " Gunner " while he dropped he balance into his quiver . " Take these , " he said . " You may get hungry before we can make another ill . " Then he scraped a hole in the loose earth and uried the remainder of the carcass . " What you doin ' that for ? " asked the " Gunner . " Afraid it will smell ? " " We may come back this way , " explained Tarzan . ' If we do Horta will be less tough . " The " Gunner " made no comment ; but he assured himself , mentally , that he " was n't no dog , " to bury is meat and then dig it up again after it had rotted . he idea almost made him sick . Tarzan quickly picked up the trail of Lafayette Smith and followed it easily , though the " Gunner " saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills . " I do n't see nothing , " he said.  | " I have noticed that , " returned Tarzan . " That , " thought Danny Patrick , " sounds like a dirty crack ; " but he said nothing . " A lion picked up his trail here , " said the ape-man . " You ai n't spoofin ' me are you ? " demanded Danny . " There ai n't no sign of nothin ' on this ground . " " Nothing that you can see perhaps , " replied Tarzan ; " but then , though you may not know it , you socalledcivilized men are almost blind and quite stone deaf . " Soon they came to the fissure , and here Tarzan saw that the man and the lion had both gone in , the lion following the man , and that only the lion had come out . " That looks tough for old Smithy , does n't it ? " said the " Gunner " when Tarzan had explained the story of the spoor . " It may , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and look for him . You can wait here or follow . You ca n't get lost if you stay inside this crack . " " Go ahead , " said Danny . " I 'll follow . " The fissure was much longer than Tarzan had imagined ; but some distance from the entrance he discoveredevidence that the lion had not attacked Smith , for he could see where Numa had turned about and that the man had continued on . Some recent scars on the sides of the fissure told him the rest of the story quite accurately . " It 's fortunate he did n't hit Numa , " soliloquized the ape-man . At the end of the fissure Tarzan had some difficultyp215in wriggling through the aperture that opened into the valley of the land of Midian ; but once through he picked up the trail of Smith again and followed it down toward the lake , while Danny , far behind him , stumbled wearily along the rough floor of the fissure . He walked rapidly for the spoor was plain . When be came to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of a woman wearing well worn European boots and another shod with sandals . When he had first entered the valley he had seene village of the South Midians in the distance and ow he drew the false conclusion that Smith had disvereda friendly people and other whites and thathe was in no danger . His curiosity piqued by the mystery of this hidden valley , the ape-man determined to visit the village beforecontinuing on Smith 's trail . Time had never ntered greatly into his calculations , trained , as he had been , by savage apes to whom time meant less than othing ; but to investigate and to know every detailf his wilderness world was as much a part of the man s is his religion to a priest . And so he continued rapidly on toward the distant illage while Danny Patrick still crawled and stumbled owly along the rocky floor of the fissure . Danny was tired . Momentarily he expected to cet Tarzan returning either with Smith or with wordf his death ; so he stopped often to rest , with the resuit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crawled through to behold the mystifying sight ofp216a strange valley spread before him , Tarzan was alreadyout of sight . " Geeze 1 " exclaimed the " Gunner . " " Who would have thought that hole led into a place like this ? I wonder which way that Tarzan guy went ? " This thought occupied the " Gunner " for a few minutes . He examined the ground as he had seen Tarzan do , mistook a few spots where some little rodent had scratched up the earth , or taken a dust bath , for the footprints of a man , and set forth in the wrong direction.  | THE stocky , blond warriors of Elija , the son of Noah , quickly surrounded and seized Lafayette Smith and his two companions . Elija picked up Smith 's pistol and examined it with interest ; then he dropped it into a goat skin pouch that was suspended from the girdle that held his single garment about him . " This one , " said Eshbaal , pointing to Jezebel , " is mine . " " Why ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw her first , " replied Eshbaal . " Did you hear what he said ? " demanded Jezebel of Lady Barbara . The English girl nodded apathetically . Her brain was numb with the disappointment and the horror of the situation , for in some respects their fate might be worse with these men than with those of South Midian . These were lusty , primitive warriors , not half-witted creatures whose natural passions had been weakened by generations of hereditary disease of nerve and brain . " He wants me , " said Jezebel . " Is he not beau-tiful ? " Lady Barbara turned upon the girl almost angrily ,  |p218and  then suddenly she remembered that Jezebel was little more than a child in experience and that she had no conception of the fate that might await her at the hands of the North Midians . In their narrow religious fanaticism the South Midians denied even the most obvious phases of procreation . The subject was absolutely taboo and so hideous had ages of training and custom made it appearto them that mothers often killed their first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poor little Jezebel , " said Lady Barbara . " What do you mean , Barbara ? " asked the girl . " Are you not happy that the beautiful man wants me ? " " Listen , Jezebel , " said Lady Barbara . " You know I am your friend , do you not ? " " My only friend , " replied the girl . " The only person I ever loved . " " Then believe me when I say that you must kill yourself , as I shall kill myself , if we are unable to escapefrom these creatures . " " Why ? " demanded Jezebel . " Are they not more beautiful than the South Midians ? " " Forget their fatal beauty , " replied Lady Barbara , " but never forget what I have told you . " " Now I am afraid , " said Jezebel . " Thank God for that , " exclaimed the English girl . The North Midians marched loosely and withoutdiscipline . They seemed a garrulous race , and theirarguments and speeches were numerous and lengthy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atargument , or in listening to a long winded oration byp219one of their fellows , that they quite forgot their prisoners , who were sometimes amongst them , sometimes in advance and once behind them . It was what Lady Barbara had been awaiting and what she had to some extent engineered . " Now ! " she whispered . " They are not looking . " She halted and turned back . They were among the trees of the forest where some concealment might be found . Smith and Jezebel had stopped at Lady Barbara 's direction ; and for an instant the three paused , breathless , watching the retreating figures of their captors . " Now run ! " whispered Lady Barbara . " We 'll scatter and meet again at the foot of the cliff . " Just what prompted Lady Barbara to suggest that they separate Lafayette Smith did not understand . To him it seemed a foolish and unnecessary decision ; but as he had a great deal more confidence in Lady Barbara'sjudgment in practical matters than in his own he did not voice his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reservations , which guided his subsequent acts . The English girl ran in a southeasterly direction , while Jezebel , obeying the commands of her friend , scurried off toward the southwest . Smith , glancing to the rear , discovered no indication that their captors had , as yet , missed them . For a moment he was hesitantas to what course to pursue . The conviction still gripped him that he was the natural protector of both girls , notwithstanding the unfortunate circumstances that had nullified his efforts to function successfully in220that role ; but he saw that it was going to be still more difficult to protect them both now that they had elected to run in different directions . However , his decision was soon made , difficult though it was . Jezebel was in her own world ; contemplation of capture by the North Midians had , so far from alarming her , appeared rather to have met with enthusiastic anticipation , on her part ; she could not be worse off with them than with the only other people she knew . Lady Barbara , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own world  --  and he had heard her say that death would be preferable to captivity among these semi-savages . His duty , therefore , was to followand protect Lady Barbara ; and so he let Jezebel take her way unprotected back toward the cliff , while he pursued the English girl in the direction of Chinnereth . Lady Barbara Collis ran until she was out of breath . For several minutes she had distinctly heard the sounds of pursuit behind her  --  the heavy footfalls of a man . Frantic from hopelessness , she drew her pocket knife from a pocket of her jacket and opened the blade as she ran . She wondered if she could destroy herself with this inadequate weapon . She was positive that she could not inflict either fatal or disabling injuries upon her pursuer with it . Yet the thought of self-destruction revolted her . The realization was upon her that she the fatal decision could not be long averted , when her had about reached the limit of her endurance , and thatp221heritage of English fighting blood decided the questionfor her . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand and defend herself . She stopped then , suddenly , and wheeled about , the little knife clutched in her right hand  --  a tigress at bay . When she saw Lafayette Smith running toward her she collapsed suddenly and sank to the ground , where she sat with her back against the bole of a tree . LafayetteSmith , breathing hard , came and sat down beside her . Neither had any breath for words . Lady Barbara was the first to regain her power of speech . " I thought I said we would scatter , " she reminded him . " I could n't leave you alone , " he replied . " But how about Jezebel ? You left her alone . " " I could n't go with both of you , " he reminded her , " and you know Jezebel is really at home here . It eans much more to you to escape than it meanso her . " She shook her head . " Capture means the same thing to either of us , " she said , " but of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself than Jezebel  --  sheoes not understand the nature of her danger . " " Nevertheless , " he insisted , " you are the more imortant . You have relatives and friends who care foryou . Poor little Jezebel has only one friend , and that  --  you , unless I may consider myself a friend , as Ihould like to do . " " I imagine we three have the unique distinction f being the closest corporation of friends in the world , " she replied , with a wan smile , " and therep222does n't seem to be anyone who wants to buy in . " " The Friendless Friends Corporation , Limited , " he suggested . " Perhaps we 'd best hold a directors ' meeting and decide what we should do next to conserve the interests of the stockholders . " " I move we move , " he said . " Seconded . " The girl rose to her feet . " You 're terribly tired , are n't you ? " he asked . " But I suppose the only thing we can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the North Midians as possible . It 's almost certain they will try to capture us again as soon as they discover we are missing . " " If we can only find a place to hide until night , " she said . " Then we can go back to the cliffs under the cover of darkness and search for Jezebel and the place that she and I thought they might be scaled . " " This forest is so open that it does n't afford any good hiding places , but at least we can look . " Perhaps we shall find a place near the lake , " said Lady Barbara . " We ought to come to it soon . " They walked on for a considerable distance withouttalking , each occupied with his own thoughts ; and as no sign of pursuit developed their spirits rose . " Do you know , " he said presently , " that I ca n't help but feel that we 're going to get out of this all right in the end ? " " But what a terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have happened to me . I ca n't forget Jobab . " It was the first time mention had been made of the tragedy at the southern village .   " You must not give that a thought , " he said . " You did the only thing possible under the circumstances . I f you had not done what you did both you and Jezebelwould have been recaptured , and you know what that would have meant . " " But I 've killed a human being , " she said . There was an awed tone in her voice . " I killed one , too , " he reminded her , " but I do n't regret it in the least , notwithstanding the fact that I never killed anyone before . If I were not such a terriblemarksman I should have killed another today , perhaps several . My regret is that I did n't . " It 's a strange world , " he continued after a moment'sreflective silence . " Now , I always consideredmyself rather well educated and fitted to meet theemergencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in theuiet environment of a college town ; but what anwful failure I have proved to be when jolted out ofy narrow little rut . I used to feel sorry for theoys who wasted their time at shooting galleries andrabbit hunting . Men who boasted of their marksanshipmerited only my contempt , yet within the lasttwenty-four hours I would have traded all my educaionalong other lines for the ability to shoot straight . " " One should know something of many things to be truly educated , " said the girl , " but I 'm afraid you xaggerate the value of marksmanship in determining one 's cultural status . " " Well , there 's cooking , " he admitted . " A person ho can not cook is not well educated . I had hoped ne day to be an authority on geology ; but with all IP224know of the subject , which of course is n't so much at that , I would probably starve to death in a land overrunningwith game , because I can neither shoot nor cook . " Lady Barbara laughed . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried . " We need every ounce of self-assurance that we can muster . I think you are top hole . You may not be much of a marksman  --  that I 'll have to admit , and perhaps you can not cook ; but you 've one thing that covers a multitude of shortcomings in a man  --  you are brave . " It was Lafayette Smith 's turn to laugh . " That 's mighty nice of you , " he said . " I 'd rather you thought that of me than anything else in the world ; and I 'd rather you thought it than any one else , because it would mean so much to you now ; but it is n't true . I was scared stiff in that village last night and when those fellows came at us today , and that 's the truth . " " Which only the more definitely justifies my statement , " she replied . " I do n't understand . " " Cultured and intelligent people are more read to realize and appreciate the dangers of a critics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when such a person stands his ground determinedly in the face of danger , or voluntarily walks into a dan  --  gerous situation from a sense of duty , as you did last night , it evidences a much higher quality of courage than that possessed by the ignorant , physical lout who has n't brains enough to visualize the contingencies that may result from his action . "   " Be careful , " he warned her , " or you 'll make me be-'eve all that  --  then I 'll be unbearably egotistical. but please do n't try to convince me that my inability o cook is a hallmark of virtue . " " I  --  listen ! What was that ? " she halted and turned her eyes toward the rear . " They have found us , " said Lafayette Smith . " Go In  --  go as fast as you can ! I 'll try to delay them . " " No , " she replied , " there is no use . I 'll remain pith you , whatever happens . " " Please ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ f you wo n't take advantage of it . " " It would n't do any good , " she said . " They 'd only het me later , and your sacrifice would be useless . We eight as well give ourselves up in the hope that we pin persuade them to free us later , or , perhaps , find e opportunity to escape after dark . " " You had better run , " he said , " because I am goingfight . I am not going to let them take you without raising a hand in your defense . If you get away now , perhaps I can get away later . We can meet at theof of the cliffs  --  but do n't wait for me if you cand a way out . Now , do as I tell you ! " His tone as peremptory  --  commanding . Obediently she continued on toward Chinnereth , but absently she stopped and turned . Three men were approaching Smith . Suddenly one of the three swung $ club and hurled it at the American , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell short of its mark , dropping at Smith 's et . She saw him stoop and seize it , and then sheP226saw another detachment of the Midians coming through the woods in the wake of the first three . Smith 's antagonists were upon him as he straightenedup with the club in his hand , and he swung it heavily upon the skull of the man who had hurled it at him and who had rushed forward in advance of his fellows with hands outstretched to seize the stranger . Like a felled ox the man dropped ; and then Lady Barbara saw Smith carry the unequal battle to the enemy as , swinging the club above his head , he rushed forward to meet them . So unexpected was his attack that the men halted and turned to elude him , but one was too slow and the girl heard the fellow 's skull crush beneath the heavy blow of the bludgeon . Then the reinforcements , advancing at a run , surroundedand overwhelmed their lone antagonist , and Smith went down beneath them . Lady Barbara could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however hopelessly , sought to defend her ; and when the North Midians had dis . armed and secured Smith they saw her standing where ; she had stood during the brief engagement . " I could n't run away and leave you , " she explained to Smith , as the two were being escorted toward the village of the North Midians . " I thought they were , going to kill you , and I could n't help you  --  Oh , it was awful . I could n't leave you then , could I ? " He looked at her for a moment . " No , " he an . swered . " You could n't . " P227DANNY " Gunner " Patrick was tired and disgusted . He had walked for several hours imaginingthat he was following a spoor , but he had seen nothing of his erstwhile companion . He was thirsty , and so cast frequent glances in the direction of the lake . " T'ell ! " he muttered . " I ai nt goin ' to tail that guy o longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like ' d been eating cotton for a week . " He turned away from the cliffs and started down n the direction of the lake , the inviting waters of hich sparkled alluringly in the afternoon sun ; but e beauties of the scene were wasted upon the ' Gunner , " who saw only a means of quenching his hirst . The way led through a field of scattered boulders alien from the towering rim above . He had to pick is way carefully among the smaller ones , and his eyes were almost constantly upon the ground . Occasionally he was compelled to skirt some of the larger masses , many of which towered above his head obstructing is view ahead . He was damning Africa in general and this section of it in particular as he rounded the corner of an unusuallylarge fragment of rock , when suddenly he stopped and his eyes went wide . " Geeze ! " he exclaimed aloud . " A broad ! " Before him , and coming in his direction , was a golden haired girl attired in a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simultaneously and halted . " Oh , " exclaimed Jezebel with a happy smile . " Who art thou ? " but as she spoke in the language of the land . of Midian the " Gunner " failed to understand her . " Geeze , " he said . " I knew I must of come to Africa for something , and I guess you 're it . Say kid , you 're about all right . I 'll tell the world you are all right . " " Thank you , " said Jezebel in English . " I am so glad that you like me . " " Geeze , " said Danny . " You talk United States , do n't you ? Where you from ? " " Midian , " replied Jezebel . " Ai nt never heard of it . What you doin ' here Where 're your people ? " " I am waiting for Lady Barbara , " replied the girl " and Smith , " she added . " Smith ! What Smith ? " he demanded . " Oh , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai nt the Smith I 'm lookin ' for , " said the , " Gunner . " " What 's he doin ' here , and who 's thi Lady Barbara dame ? " " Abraham , the son of Abraham , would have killedp229Lady Barbara and Jezebel if Smith had not come and saved us . He is very brave . " " Now I know it ai nt my Smith , " said Danny , " though I ai nt sayin ' he ai nt got guts . What I mean Is he would n't know enough to save no one  --  he 's a geologist . " " Who are you ? " demanded Jezebel . " Call me Danny , Kid . " " My name is not kid , " she explained sweetly . " It Is Jezebel . " " Jezebel ! Geeze , what a monicker ! You look like It ought to be Gwendolyn . " " It is Jezebel , " she assured him . " Do you know who I hoped you 'd be ? " " No . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . Probably President Hoover or Big Bill Thompson , eh ? " " I do not know them , " said Jezebel . " I hoped that you were the Gunner . ' " " The ' Gunner ' ? What do you know about the ' Gunner , ' kid ? " " My name is not kid , it is Jezebel , " she corrected him , sweetly . " Oke , Jez , " conceded Danny , " but tell me who wised you up to the Gunner ' bozo . " " My name is not Jez , it is " Oh , sure kid , it 's Jezebel  --  that 's oke by me ; but how about the ' Gunner ' ? " " What about him ? " " I just been a-askin ' you . " " But I do n't understand your language , " explained Jezebel . " It sounds like English , but it is not the English Lady Barbara taught me . " " It ai nt English , " Danny assured her , seriously ; " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English though , is n't it ? " " Sure , " said the " Gunner . " " The only difference is we can understand English but the English do n't never seem to understand all of ours . I guess they 're dumb . " " Oh , no , they 're not dumb , " Jezebel assured him . " Lady Barbara is English , and she can talk quite as well as you . " Danny scratched his head . " I did n't say they , was dummies . I said they was dumb . Dummies ca n't talk only with their mits . If a guy 's dumb , he do n't know nothing . " " Oh , " said Jezebel . " But what I asked you is , who wised you up to this Gunner ' bozo ? " " Can you say it in English , please , " asked Jezebel . " Geeze , what could be plainer ? I asked who told ' you about the Gunner ' and what did they tell you ? " Danny was waxing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gunner ' was a friend of his ; and when I saw you I thought you must be Smith 's friend , hunting for him . " " Now , what do you know about that ! " exclaimed Danny . " I have just told you what I know about it , " explained the girl ; " but perhaps you did not understand me . Perhaps you are what you call dumb . "  | " Are you trying to kid me , kid ? " demanded the " Gunner . " " My name is not " " Oh , all right , all right . I know what your name is . " " Then why do you not call me by my name ? Do you not like it ? " " Sure , kid  --  I mean Jezebel  --  sure I like it . It 's a swell handle when you get used to it . But tell me , where is old Smithy ? " " I do not know such a person . " " But you just told me you did . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Smithy is the United States for Smith . But Smith is not old . He 's quite young . " " Well , where is he ? " demanded Danny , resignedly . " We were captured by the beautiful men from North Midian , " explained Jezebel ; " but we escaped and ran away . We ran in different directions , but we are going to meet tonight farther south along the liffs . " " Beautiful men ? " demanded the " Gunner . " " Did old Smithy let a bunch of fairies hoist him ? " " I do not understand , " said Jezebel . " You would n't , " he assured her ; " but say , kid " My name " " Aw , forget it  --  you know who I mean . As I was saying , let 's me and you stick together till we find old Smithy . What say ? " " That will be nice , the Gunner , ' " she assured him . " Say , call me Danny , k  --  Jezebel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I never knew Danny was such a swell monicker till I heard you say it . What say we beat it for the big drink down there ? I got me such a thirst my tongue 's hanging out . Then we can come back to this here rock pile and look for old Smithy . " " That will be nice , " agreed Jezebel . " I , too , am thirsty . " She sighed . " You can not know how happy I am , Danny . " " Why ? " he asked . " Because you are with me . " " Geeze , k  --  Jezebel , but you 're sure a fast worker . " " I do not know what you mean , " she replied , innocently . " Well just tell me why you 're happy because I 'm with you . " " It is because I feel safe with you after what Smith told us . He said he always felt safe when you were around . " " So that 's it ? All you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like me for myself at all , eh ? " " Oh , of course I like you , Danny , " cried the girl . " I think you are beautiful . " " Yeah ? Well , listen , sister . You may be a swell kidder  --  I du n no  --  or you may be just a dumb egg  --  but do n't call me no names . I know what my pan looks like ; and it ai nt beautiful , and I ai nt never wore a beret . " Jezebel , who only caught the occasional high spots of Danny 's conversation , made no reply ; and theyP233walked on in the direction of the lake , in silence , for some time . The forest was some little distance away , on their left , and they had no knowledge of what was transpiring there , nor did any sound reach their ears to acquaint them with the misfortune that was befallingLady Barbara and Lafayette Smith . At the lake they quenched their thirst , after which the " Gunner " announced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started back toward the cliffs . " I wonder , " he said , " just how far a guy can walk , because in the last two days I 've walked that far and back again . " " How far is that ? " inquired Jezebel . He looked at her a moment and then shook his head . " It 's twice as far , " he said , as he stretched himself at full length and closed his eyes . " Geeze , but I 'm about all in , " he murmured . " In what ? " He deigned no reply , and presently the girl noted from his altered breathing that he was asleep . She sat with her eyes glued upon him , and occasionally a deep sigh broke from her lips . She was comparing Danny with Abraham , the son of Abraham , with Lafayette Smith and with the beautiful men of North Midian ; and the comparison was not uncomplimentary to Danny . The hot sun was beating down upon them , for there was no shade here ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her drowsy . She lay down near the " Gunner " and stretched luxuriously . Then she , too , fell asleep .   The " Gunner " did not sleep very long ; the sun was too hot . When he awoke he raised himself on an elbowand looked around . His eyes fell on the girl and there they rested for some time , noting the graceful contours of the lithe young body , the wealth of golden hair , and the exquisite face . " The kid 's sure some looker , " soliloquized Danny . " I seen a lotta broads in my day , but I ai nt never seen nothin ' could touch her . She 'd sure be a swell numberdolled up in them Boul Mich rags . Geeze , would n't she knock their lamps out ! I wonder where this Midian burgh is she says she comes from . If they 's all as swell lookin ' as her , that 's the burgh for me . " Jezebel stirred and he reached over and shook her on the shoulder . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " We do n't want to miss old Smithy and that dame . " Jezebel sat up and looked about her . " Oh , " she exclaimed , " you frightened me . I thought something was coming . " " Why ? Been dreaming ? " " No . You said we 'd have to beat something . " " Aw , cheese it ! I meant we 'd have to be hittin ' the trail for the big rocks . " Jezebel looked puzzled . " Hike back to them cliffs where you said old Smithy and that Lady Barbara dame were going to meet you . " " Now I understand , " said Jezebel . " All right , come on . " But when they reached the cliffs there was no sign of Smith or Lady Barbara , and at Jezebel 's suggestionP235they walked slowly southward in the direction of the place where she and the English girl had hoped to make a crossing to the outer world . " How did you get into the valley , Danny ? " asked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountain , " he replied . " That must be the same place Smith came through , " she said . " Could you find it again ? " " Sure . That 's where I 'm headed for now . " It was only mid-afternoon when Danny located the opening into the fissure . They had seen nothing of Lady Barbara and Smith , and they were in a quandary as to what was best to do . " Maybe they come along and made their getaway while we was hittin ' the hay , " suggested Danny . " I do n't know what you are talking about , " said Jezebel , " but what I think is that they may have locatedthe opening while we were asleep and gone out of the valley . " " Well ai nt that what I said ? " demanded Danny . " It did n't sound like it . " " Say , you trying to high hat me ? " " High hat ? " " Aw , what 's the use ? " growled the " Gunner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat it out of this here dump and look for old Smithy and the skirt on the other side . What say ? " " But suppose they have n't gone out ? " " Well , then we 'll have to come back again ; but I 'm sure they must have . See this foot print ? " He indi- Bated one of his own , made earlier in the day , which pointed toward the valley . " I guess I 'm getting good , " he said . " Pretty soon that Tarzan guy wont have no edge on me at all . " " I 'd like to see what 's on the other side of the cliffs , " said Jezebel . " I have always wanted to do that . " " Well , you wo n't see nothin ' much , " he assured her . " Just some more scenery . They ai nt even a hot dog Stand or a single speakeasy . " " What are those ? " " Well , you might call ' em filling stations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kid , what do you think I am , a college perfessor ? I never saw anyone who could ask so many questions in my whole life . " " My name " " Yes , I know what your name is . Now come on and we 'll crawl through this hole-in-the-wall . I 'll go first . You follow right behind me . " The rough going along the rocky floor of the fissure taxed the " Gunner 's " endurance and his patience , but Jezebel was all excitement and anticipation . All her life she had dreamed of what might lie in the wonderworldbeyond the cliffs . Her people had told her that it was a flat expanse filled with sin , heresy , and iniquity , where , if one went too far he would surely fall over the edge and alight in the roaring flames of an eternal hades ; but Jezebel had been a doubter . She had preferred to picture it as a land of flowers and trees and running water , where beautiful people laughed and sang through long ,  |p237sunny  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she was much excited by the prospect . And now at last they came to the end of the great fissure and looked out across the rolling foot hills toward a great forest in the distance . Jezebel clasped her hands together in ecstacy . " Oh , Danny , " she cried , " how beautiful it is ! " " What ? " asked the " Gunner . " " Oh , everything . Do n't you think it is beautii : , Danny ? " " The only beautiful thing around here , k  --  Jezebel , is you , " said Danny . The girl turned and looked up at him with her great blue eyes . " Do you think I am beautiful , Danny ? " " Sure I do . " " Do you think I am too beautiful ? " " There ai nt no such thing , " he replied , " but if they was you 're it . What made you ask ? " " Lady Barbara said I was . " The " Gunner " considered this for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid . " " You like to call me Kid , do n't you ? " asked Jezebel . " Well , it seems more friendly-like , " he explained , " and it 's easier to remember . " " All right , you may call me Kid if you want to , but my name is Jezebel . " " That 's a bet , " said Danny . " When I do n't think to call you Jezebel , I 'll call you kid , Sister . " The girl laughed . " You 're a funny man , Danny .   You like to say everything wrong . I 'm not your sister , of course . " " And I 'm damn glad you ai nt , kid . " " Why ? Do n't you like me ? " Danny laughed . " I never seen a kid like you before , " he said . " You sure got me guessin ' . But at that , " he added , a little seriously for him , " they 's one thing I ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good little kid . " " I do n't know what you are talking about , " said Jezebel . " And at that I 'll bet you do n't , " he replied ; " and now kid , let 's sit down and rest . I 'm tired . " " I 'm hungry , " said Jezebel . " I ai nt never see a skirt that was n't , but why did you have to bring that up ? I 'm so hungry I could eat hay . " " Smith killed a kid and we ate some of that , " said Jezebel . " He wrapped the rest up in the skin and I suppose he lost it when the North Midians attacked us . I wish " " Say , " exclaimed Danny , " what a dumb-bell I am ! " He reached down into one of his pockets and brought out several strips of raw meat . " Here I been packin ' this around all day and forgets all about it  --  and me starvin ' to death . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaning closer to inspect the unsavory morsels . " It 's pig , " said Danny as he started searching for twigs and dry grass to build a fire , " and I know where they is a lot more that I thought I could n't never catP239but I know now I could  --  even if I had to fight with the maggots for it . " Jezebel helped him gather wood , which was extremelyscarce , being limited to dead branches of a small variety of artemisia that grew on the mountain side ; but at length they had collected quite a supply , and presently they were grilling pieces of the boar meat over the flames . So preoccupied were they that neither saw three horsemen draw rein at the top of a ridge a mile away and survey them . " This is like housekeeping , ai nt it ? " remarked the " Gunner . " " What is that ? " asked Jezebel . " That 's where a guy and his girl friend get hitched and go to doin ' their own cooking . Only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to be no dishes to wash . " " What is hitched , Danny ? " asked Jezebel . " Why  --  er , " Danny flushed . He had said many things to many girls in his life , many of them things that might have brought a blush to the cheek of a wooden Indian ; but this was the first time , perhaps , that Danny had felt any embarrassment . " Why  --  er , " he repeated , " hitched means married . " " Oh , " said Jezebel . She was silent for a while , watching the pork sizzling over the little flames . Then she looked up at Danny . " I think housekeeping is fun , " she said . " So do I , " agreed Danny ; " with you , " he added and his voice was just a trifle husky . His eyes were on her ; and there was a strange light in them , that no other girl had ever seen there . " You 're a funny little kid , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and then the neglected pork fell off the end of the sharpened twig , with which he had been holding it , and tumbled into the fire . " Geeze ! " exclaimed Danny . " Look at that ! " He fished the unsavory looking morsel from the ashes and flames and surveyed it . " It do n't look so good , but I 'm goin ' to fool it . I 'm goin ' to eat it anyway . I would n't care if a elephant had sat on it for a week  --  I 'd eat it , and the elephant , too . " " Oh , look ! " cried Jezebel . " Here come some men and they are all black . What strange beasts are they sitting on ? Oh , Danny , I am afraid . " At her first exclamation the " Gunner " had turned and leaped to his feet . A single look told him who the strangers were  --  no strangers to him . " Beat it , kid ! " he cried . " Duck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the valley . They ca n't follow you on gee-gees . " The three shi f tas were already close ; and when they saw that they had been discovered they spurred forwardat a gallop , and yet Jezebel stood beside the little fire , wide eyed and frightened . She had not understood the strange argot that the " Gunner " employedin lieu of English . " Beat it " and " duck " and " hit the trail " had not been included in the English idiom she had gleaned from Lady Barbara Collis . But even had she understood him it would have made no difference , for Jezebel was not of the clay that is soft in the face of danger , her little feet not of thep241kind that run away , leaving a companion in distress . The " Gunner " glanced behind him and saw her . " For God 's sake run , kid , " he cried . " These are tough guys . I know ' em , " then the shiftas were upon him . To conserve ammunition , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride him down , striking at him with their rifles . He dodged the leadinghorseman ; and as the fellow reined in to wheel his mount back to the attack , the " Gunner " leaped to his side and dragged him from the saddle . The mount of a second shifta stumbled over the two men and fell , unhorsing its rider . The " Gunner " seized the long rifle that had fallen from the hands of the man he had dragged down and scrambled to his feet . Jezebel watched him in wide eyed wonder and admiration . She saw him swing the rifle like a club and strike at the third horseman , and then she saw the one he had first grappled lunge forward and , seizing him around the legs , drag him down , while the second to be unhorsed ran in now and leaped upon him just as the remaining shifta struck him a heavy blow on the head . As she saw him fall , the blood gushing from an ugly wound in his head , Jezebel ran forward to him ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of a horse in front of one of them , the others mounted , and the three galloped away with their prisoner , leavingDanny " Gunner " Patrick lying motionless in a welter of his own blood . P242IN THE VILLAGE OF ELIJAAS TARZAN approached the village of Abraham , the son of Abraham , he was seen by a watcher who immediately warned his fellows , with the result that when the ape-man arrived the huts were deserted , the villagers having taken refuge in the caves in the face of the towering cliff . Abraham , the son of Abraham , from the safety of the highest cave , exhorted his people to repel the advanceof this strange creature , whose partial nakednessand strange armament filled him with alarm , with the result that when Tarzan came near the base of the cliff the villagers , with much shouting , rolled rocks down the steep declivity in an effort to destroy him . The Lord of the Jungle looked up at the howling creatures above him . Whatever his emotions his face did not reveal them . Doubtless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him only fear and cowardice . As naught but curiosity had prompted his visit to this strange village , since he knew that Smith already had quitted it , he remained only long enough for a brief survey of the people and their culture , neither of which was sufficiently attractive to detain him ; andp243then he turned and retracted his steps toward the place on the shore of Chinnereth where he had picked up the northbound spoor of Smith and Lady Barbara and Jezebel . He made his way in a leisurely manner , stopping beside the lake to quench his thirst and eat from his small store of boar meat ; and then he lay down to rest , after the manner of beasts who have fed and are not hurried . In the village he had quitted Abraham , the son of Abraham , gave thanks to Jehovah for their deliverancefrom the barbarian , though reserving proper credit to himself for his masterly defense of his flock . And how fared it with Lady Barbara and Lafayette Smith ? Following their recapture they were permittedno second opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northward toward the village of Elija , the son of Noah . The girl was much depressed ; and Smith sought to reassure her , though upon what grounds he himself could scarcely explain . " I can not believe that they intend to harm us , " he said . " We have done nothing worse than kill one of their goats and that only because we were starving . I can pay them whatever price they name for the animal , and thus they will be recompensed and have no further cause for complaint against us . " " With what will you pay them ? " asked Lady Barbara . " I have money , " replied Smith . " Of what good would it be to them ? "   " Of what good would it be to them ! Why theycould buy another goat if they wanted to , " he replied . " These people know nothing of money , " she said . " It would be worthless to them . " " I suppose you are right , " he admitted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could give them my pistol , then . " " They already have it . " " But it 's mine , " he exclaimed . " They 'll have to give it back to me . " She shook her head . " You are not dealing with civilized people guided by the codes and customs of civilization or responsible to the law-enforcing agencies with which we are familiar and which , perhaps , are all that keep us civilized . " " We escaped once , " he ventured ; " perhaps we can escape again . " " That , I think , is our only hope . " The village of the North Midians , where they presently arrived , was more pretentious than that of the people at the southern end of the valley . While there were many crude huts there were also several of stone , while the entire appearance of the village was more cleanly and prosperous . Several hundred villagers came to meet the party as soon as it was sighted , and the prisoners noted that there was no evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South Midians . On the contrary , these people appeared endowed with abundant health , they looked intelligent and , physically , they were a splendid race , many ofP245them being handsome . All were golden haired and blue eyed . That they were descended from the same stock that had produced Abraham , the son of Abraham , and his degraded flock would have appeared impossible , yet such was the fact . The women and children pushed and jostled one another and the men in their efforts to get close to the prisoners . They jabbered and laughed incessantly , the clothing of the prisoners seeming to arouse the greatest wonder and mirth . Their language being practically the same as that of the South Midians Lady Barbara had no difficulty in understanding what they were saying , and from scraps of their conversation which she overheard she realized that her worst fears might be realized . However , the crowd offered them no personal injury ; and it was apparent that in themselves they were not inherentlya cruel people , though their religion and their customs evidently prescribed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Upon arrival in the village Lady Barbara and Smith were separated . She was taken to a hut and put in charge of a young woman , while Smith was confined , under guard of several men , in another . Lady Barbara 's jailer , far from being ill favored , was quite beautiful , bearing a strong resemblance to Jezebel ; and she proved to be quite as loquacious as the men who had captured them . " You are the strangest looking South Midian I ever saw , " she remarked , " and the man does not look at all like one . Your hair is neither the color of those they keep nor of those they destroy  --  it is just between , and your garments are such as no one ever saw before . " " We are not Midians , " said Lady Barbara . " But that is impossible , " cried the woman . " There are none but Midians in the land of Midian and no way to get in or out . Some say there are people beyond the great cliffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are not a Midian perhaps you are a devil ; but then , of course , you are a Midian . " " We come from a country beyond the cliffs , " Lady Barbara told her , " and all we want is to go back to our own country . " " I do not think Elija will let you . He will treat you as we always treat South Midians . " " And how is that ? " " The men are put to death because of their heresy ; and the women , if they are good looking , are kept as slaves . But being a slave is not bad . I am a slave . My mother was a slave . She was a South Midian who was captured by my father who owned her . She was very beautiful . After a while the South Midians would have killed her , as you do to all your beautiful women just before their first child is born . " But we are different . We kill the bad looking ones , both boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strange demons which afflict the South Midians . Do you have these demons ? " " I am not a Midian , I told you , " said Lady Barbara . The woman shook her head . " It is true that youp247do not look like them , but if Elija ever believes you are not you are lost . " " Why ? " asked Lady Barbara . " Elija is one of those who believe that the world beyond the cliffs is inhabited by demons ; so , if you are not a South Midian , you must be a demon ; and he would certainly destroy you as he will destroy the man ; but for my part I am one of those who say they do not know . Some say that perhaps this world around Midian is inhabited by angels . Are you an angel ? " " I am not a demon , " replied Lady Barbara . " Then you must be a South Midian or an angel . " " I am no South Midian , " insisted the English girl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . " And if you are you will have no difficulty in provingit . " " How ? " " Just perform a miracle . " " Oh , " said Lady Barbara . " Is the man an angel ? " demanded the woman . " He is an American . " " I never heard of that  --  is it a kind of angel ? " " Europeans do not call them that . " " But really I think Elija will say he is a South Midian , and he will be destroyed . " " Why do your people hate the South Midians so ? " asked Lady Barbara . " They are heretics . " " They are very religious , " said Lady Barbara ; " they pray all the time to Jehovah and they never smile . Why do you think them heretics ? "  | " They insist that Paul 's hair was black , while we know that it was yellow . They are very wicked , blasphemous people . Once , long before the memory of man , we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among us who had black hair and wished to kill all those with yellow hair ; so those with yellow hair ran away and came to the north end of the valley . Ever since , the North Midians have killed all those with black hair and the South Midians all those with yellow hair . Do you think Paul had yellowhair ? " " Certainly I do , " said Lady Barbara . " That will be a point in your favor , " said the woman . Just then a man came to the door of the hut and summoned Lady Barbara . " Come with me , " he commanded . The English girl followed the messenger , and the woman who had been guarding her accompanied them . Before a large stone hut they found Elija surrounded by a number of the older men of the village , while the remainder of the population was grouped in a semi-circle facing them . Lafayette Smith stood before Elija , and Lady Barbara was conducted to the side of the American . Elija , the Prophet , was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short and stocky , extremely muscular in build , and his face was adorned with a wealth of blond whiskers . Like the other North Midians he was garbed in a single garmentof goat skin , his only ornament being the pis/tol he had taken from Smith , which he wore on a leather thong that encircled his neck . " This man , " said Elija , addressing Lady Barbara , " will not talk . He makes noises , but they mean nothing . Why will he not talk ? " " He does not understand the language of the land of Midian , " replied the English girl . " He must understand it , " insisted Elija ; " every one understands it . " " He is not from Midian , " said Lady Barbara . " Then he must be a demon , " said Elija . " Perhaps he is an angel , " suggested Lady Barbara ; " he believes that Paul 's hair was yellow . " This statement precipitated a wordy argument and so impressed Elija and his apostles that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference . " What 's it all about , Lady Barbara ? " asked Smith , who , of course , had understood nothing of what had been said . " You believe Paul 's hair was yellow , do n't you ? " she asked . " I do n't know what you are talking about . " " Well , I told them you were a firm believer in the yellowness of Paul 's hair . " " Why did you tell them that ? " demanded Smith . " Because the North Midians prefer blonds , " she replied . " But who is Paul ? " " Was , you mean . He is dead . " " Of course I 'm sorry to hear that , but who was he ? " insisted the American .   " I am afraid you have neglected the scriptures . " she told him . " Oh , the apostle ; but what difference does it make what color his hair was ? " " It does n't make any difference , " she explained . " What does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , that you believe he had yellow hair ; and that may be the means of saving your life . " " What nonsense ! " " Of course  --  the other fellow 's religion is always nonsense ; but not to him . You are also suspected of being an angel . Can you imagine ! " " No ! Who suspects me ? " " It was I ; or at least I suggested it , and I am hopingElija will now suspect it . If he does we are both safe , provided that , in your celestial capacity , you will intercede for me . " " You are as good as saved then , " he said , " for inasmuch as I can not speak their language you can put any words you wish into my mouth without fear of being called to account . " " That 's a fact , is n't it ? " she said , laughing . " If our emergency were not so critical I could have a lot of fun , could n't I ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied , admiringly ; " even in the face of disaster . " " Perhaps I am whistling in the dark , " she said . They talked a great deal while they waited for Elija and the apostles to return , for it helped them to tide over the anxious minutes of nervous strain that slowly dragged into hours . They could hearp251the chatter and buzz of conversation within the hut , as Elija and his fellows debated , while , outside , the villagers kept up a constant babel of conversation . " They like to talk , " commented Smith . " And perhaps you have noticed an idiosyncrasy of the North Midians in this respect ? " she asked . " Lots of people like to talk . " " I mean that the men gabble more than the women . " " Perhaps in self-defense . " " Here they comet " she exclaimed as Elija appeared in the doorway of the hut , fingering the pistol he wore as an ornament . Darkness was already falling as the Prophet and the twelve apostles filed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands in a signal for silence and when quiet had been restored he spoke . " With the aid of Jehovah , " he said , " we have wrestled with a mighty question . There were some among us who contended that this man is a South Midian , and others that he is an angel . Mighty was the weight of the statement that he believes that Paul had yellow hair , for if such is the truth then indeed he is not a heretic ; and if he is no heretic he is not a South Midian , for they , as all the world knows , are heretics . Yet again , it was brought forth that if he is a demon he might still claim that he believed in the yellowness of Paul , in order that he might deceive us . " How were we to know ? We must know lest we , through our ignorance , do sin against one of His angels and bring down the wrath of Jehovah upon our heads .   " But at last I , Elija , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the son of Jehovah , discovered the truth . The man is no angel ! The revelation descendedupon me in a burst of glory from Jehovah Himself  --  the man can not be an angel because he has no wings ! " There was an immediate burst of " Amens " and " Hallelujahs " from the assembled villagers , while Lady Barbara went cold with dread . " Therefore , " continued Elija , " he must be either a South Midian or a demon , and in either case he must be destroyed . " Lady Barbara turned a pale face toward Lafayette Smith  --  pale even through its coating of tan . Her lip trembled , just a little . It was the first indication of a weaker , feminine emotion that Smith had seen this remarkable girl display . " What is it ? " he asked . " Are they going to harm you ? " " It is you , my dear friend , " she replied . " You must escape . " " But how ? " he asked . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she cried . " There is only one way . You will have to make a break for it  --  now . It is dark . They will not expectit . I will do something to engage their attention , and then you make a dash for the forest . " He shook his head . " No , " he said . " We shall go together , or I do not go . " " Please , " she begged , " or it will be too late . " Elija had been talking to one of his apostles , andp253now he raised his voice again so that all might hear . " Lest we have mistaken the divine instructions of Jehovah , " he said , " we shall place this man in the mercy of Jehovah and as Jehovah wills so shall it be . Make ready the grave . If he is indeed an angel he will arise unharmed . " " Oh , go ; please go ! " cried Lady Barbara . " What did he say ? " demanded Smith . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried . " And you , " he asked ; " what are they going to do to you ? " " I am to be held in slavery . " With sharpened sticks and instruments of bone and stone a number of men were already engaged in excavatinga grave in the center of the village street before the hut of Elija , who stood waiting its completionsurrounded by his apostles . The Prophet was still toying with his new found ornament , concerning the purpose and mechanism of which he was wholly ignorant . Lady Barbara was urging Smith to attempt escape while there was yet an opportunity , and the American was considering the best plan to adopt . " You will have to come with me , " he said . " I think if we make a sudden break right back through the village toward the cliffs we shall find our best chance for success . There are fewer people congregatedon that side . " From the darkness beyond the village on the forest side a pair of eyes watched the proceedings taking place before the hut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes crept closer until he stood in the shadow of a hut at the edge of the village . Suddenly Smith , seizing Lady Barbara 's hand , started at a run toward the north side of the village ; and so unexpected was his break for liberty that , for a moment , no hand was raised to stay him ; but an instantlater , at a cry from Elija , the entire band leaped in pursuit , while from the shadow of the hut where he had stood concealed the watcher slipped forward into the village where he stood near the hut of Elija watching the pursuit of the escaped prisoners . He was alone , for the little central compound of the villagehad emptied as by magic , even the women and children having joined in the chase . Smith ran swiftly , holding tightly to the girl 's hand ; and close on their heels came the leaders of the pursuit . No longer did the village fires light their way ; and only darkness loomed ahead , as the moon had not yet risen . Gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a half circle toward the south . There was yet a chance that they might make good their escape if they could outdistance the nearer of their pursuers until they reached the forest , for their strait gave them both speed and endurance far above normal . But just as success seemed near they entered a patch of broken lava rock , invisible in the darkness ; and Smith stumbled and fell dragging Lady Barbara down with him . Before they could scramble to their feet the leading Midian was upon them . The American freed himself for a moment andP255struggled to his feet ; and again the fellow sought to seize him , but Smith swung a heavy blow to his chin and felled him . Brief , however , was this respite , for almost immediatelyboth the American and the English girl were overwhelmed by superior numbers and once again found themselves captives , though Smith fought until he was overpowered , knocking his antagonists to right and left . Miserably dejected , they were dragged back to the village compound , their last hope gone ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the torture of their victim . Smith was conducted to the edge of the excavation , where he was held by two stalwart men , while Elija raised his voice in prayer , and the remainder of the assemblageknelt , bursting forth occasionally with hallelujahsand amens . When he had concluded his long prayer the Prophet paused . Evidently there was something on his mind which vexed him . In fact it was the pistol which dangled from the thong about his neck . He was not quite sure of its purpose , and he was about to destroy the only person who might tell him . To Elija the pistol was quite the most remarkable possession that had ever fallen into his hands , and he was filled with a great curiosity concerning it . It might be , he argued , some magic talisman for averting evil , or , upon the other hand , it might be the charm of a demon or a sorcerer , that would work evil upon him . At that thought he quickly removed the thong from about his neck , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this ? " he demanded , turning to Lady Barbara and exhibiting the pistol . " It is a weapon , " she said . " Be careful or it will kill some one . " " How does it kill ? " asked Elija . " What is he saying ? " demanded Smith . " He is asking how the pistol kills , " replied the girl . A brilliant idea occurred to the American . " Tellhim to give it to me , and I will show him , " he said . But when she translated the offer to Elija he demurred . " He could then kill me with it , " he said , shrewdly . " He wont give it to you , " the girl told Smith . " He is afraid you want to kill him . " " I do , " replied the man . " Tell him , " said Elija , " to explain to me how I may kill some one with it . " " Repeat my instructions to him very carefully , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prophet . " Tell him how to grasp the pistol , " and when Lady Barbara had done so and Elija held the weapon by the grip in his right hand , " now tell him to place his index finger through the guard , but warn him not to pull the trigger . " Elija did as he was bid . " Now , " continued Smith , " explain to him that in order to see how the weapon operates he should place one eye to the muzzle and look down the barrel . " " But I can see nothing , " expostulated Elija whenp257he had done as Lady Barbara directed . " It is quite dark down the little hole . " " He says it is too dark in the barrel for him to see anything , " repeated Lady Barbara to the American . " Explain to him that if he pulls the trigger there will be a light in the barrel , " said Smith . " But that will be murder , " exclaimed the girl . " It is war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may escape . " Lady Barbara steeled herself . " You could see nothingbecause you did not press the little piece of metal beneath your index finger , " she explained to Elija . " What will that do ? " demanded the prophet . " It will make a light in the little hole , " said Lady Barbara . Elija again placed his eye against the muzzle ; and this time he pulled the trigger ; and as the report cracked the tense silence of the watching villagers Elija , the son of Noah , pitched forward upon his face . Instantly Lady Barbara sprang toward Smith , who simultaneously sought to break away from the grip of the men who held him ; but they , although astonished at what had occurred , were not to be caught off their guard , and though he struggled desperately they held him . For an instant there was a hushed silence ; and then pandemonium broke loose as the villagers realized that their prophet was dead , slain by the wicked charm of a demon ; but at the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a strange and remarkable figure that sprang from the hut of Elija , stooped and picked up the pistol that had fallen from the hands of the dead man , and leaped to the side of the prisoner struggling with his guards . This was such a man as none of them had ever seen  --  a giant white man with a tousled shock of black hair and with grey eyes that sent a shiver through them , so fierce and implacable were they . Naked he was but for a loin cloth of skin , and the muscles that rolled beneath his brown hide were muscles such as they never had seen before . As the newcomer sprang toward the American one of the men guarding Smith , sensing that an attempt was being made to rescue the prisoner , swung his club in readiness to deal a blow against the strange creature advancing upon him . At the same time the other guard sought to drag Smith from the compound . The American did not at first recognize Tarzan of the Apes , yet , though he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he sensed that he was an enemy of the Midians , and so struggled to prevent his guard from forcing him away . Another Midian seized Lady Barbara with the intention of carrying her from the scene , for all the villagersbelieved that the strange giant was a friend of the prisoners and had come to effect their release . Smith was successful in tearing himself free from the man who held him , and immediately sprang to the girl 's assistance , felling her captor with a single blow , just as Tarzan levelled the American 's pistol at the guard who was preparing to cudgel him.  |p259The  sound of this second shot and the sight of their fellow dropping to the ground , as had Elija , filled the Midians with consternation ; and for a moment they fell back from the three , leaving them alone in the center of the compound . " Quick ! " called Tarzan to Smith . " You and the girl get out of here before they recover from their surprise . I will follow you . That way , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lady Barbara hurried from the village Tarzan backed slowly after them , keeping the little pistol in full view of the frightened villagers , who , having seen two of their number die beneath its terrifying magic , were loath to approach it too closely . Until out of range of a thrown club Tarzan continued his slow retreat ; then he wheeled and bounded off into the night in pursuit of Lafayette Smith and Lady Barbara Collis . P260THE BEST THREE OUT OF . FIVETHOUGH Jezebel was terrified by the black faces of her captors and by the strange beasts they bestrode , the like of which she had never even imagined , her fear for herself was outweighed by her sorrow . Her one thought was to escape and return to the side of the " Gunner , " even though she believed him dead from the terrific blow that his assailant had struck him . She struggled violently to free herself from the grasp of the man in front of whom she rode ; but the fellow was far too powerful ; and , though she was difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likelihoodthat she might escape . Her efforts , however , angered him and at last he struck her , bringing to the girl a realization of the futility of pitting her puny strength against his . She must wait , then , until she could accomplish by stealth what she could not effect by force . The village of the raiders lay but a short distance from the point at which she had been captured , and but a few minutes had elapsed since that event when they rode up to its gates and into the central compound.  |p261The  shouts that greeted the arrival of a new and beautiful prisoner brought Capietro and Stabutch to the doorway of their hut . " Now what have the black devils brought in ? " exclaimed Capietro . " It looks like a young woman , " said Stabutch . " It is , " cried Capietro , as the shi f tas approached the hut with their prisoner . " We shall have company , eh , Stabutch ? Who have you there , my children ? " he demanded of the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ransom , perhaps , " replied one of the blacks . " Where did you find her ? " " Above the village a short distance , when we were , returning from scouting . A man was with her . The man who escaped with the help of the ape-man . " " Where is he ! Why did you not bring him , also ? " demanded Capietro . " He fought us , and we were forced to kill him . " " You have done well , " said Capietro . " She is worth two of him  --  in many ways . Come girl , hold up your head , let us have a look at that pretty face . Come , you need not fear anything  --  if you are a good girl you will find Dommic Capietro a good fellow . " " Perhaps she does not understand Italian , " suggestedStabutch . " You are right , my friend ; I shall speak to her in English . " Jezebel had looked up at Stabutch when she heard him speak a language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she thought ; but when she saw his face her heart sank . " What a beauty ! " ejaculated the Russian . " You have fallen in love with her quickly , my friend , " commented Capietro . " Do you want to buy her ? " " How much do you want for her ? " " Friends should not bargain , " said the Italian . " Wait , I have it ! Come , girl , " and he took Jezebel by the arm and led her into the hut , where Stabutch followed them . " Why was I brought here ? " asked Jezebel . " I have not harmed you . Let me go back to Danny ; he is hurt . " " He is dead , " said Capietro ; " but do n't you grieve , little one . You now have two friends in place of the one you have lost . Soon you will forget him ; it is easy for a woman to forget . " " I shall never forget him , " cried Jezebel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps he is not dead . " Then she broke down and cried . Stabutch stood eyeing the girl hungrily . Her youth and her beauty aroused a devil within him , and he made a mental vow that he would possess her . " Do not cry , " he said , kindly . " I am your friend . Everythingwill be all right . " The new tone in his voice gave hope to Jezebel , and she looked up at him gratefully . " If you are my friend , " she said , " take me away from here and back to Danny . "  | " After a while , " replied Stabutch , and then to Capietro , " How much ? " " I shall not sell her to my good friend , " replied the Italian . " Let us have a drink , and then I shall explain my plan . " The two drank from a bottle standing on the earth floor of the hut . " Sit down , " said Capietro , waving Jezebel to a seat on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his duffle bag and brought out a deck of soiled and grimy cards . " Be seated , my friend , " he said to Stabutch . " Let us have another drink , and then you shall hear my plan . " Stabutch drank from the bottle and wiped his lips with the back of his hand . " Well , " he said , " what is it ? " " We shall play for her , " exclaimed the Italian , shuffling the deck , " and whoever wins , keeps her . " " Let us drink to that , " said Stabutch . " Five games , eh , and the first to win three takes her ? " " Another drink to seal the bargain ! " exclaimed the Italian . " The best three out of five ! " Stabutch won the first game , while Jezebel sat lookingon in ignorance of the purpose of the bits of pasteboard , and only knowing that in some way they were to decide her fate . She hoped the younger man would win , but only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps she could persuade him to take her back to Danny . She wondered what kind of water was in the bottle from which they drank , for she noticed that it wrought a change in them : They talked much louder now and shouted strange words when the little cards were thrown upon the rug , and then one would appear very angry while the other always laughed immoderately . Also they swayed and lurched in a peculiar manner that she had not noticed before they had drunk so much of the water from the bottle . Capietro won the second game and the third . Stabutchwas furious , but now he became very quiet . He exerted all his powers of concentration upon the game , and he seemed almost sober as the cards were dealt for the fourth game . " She is as good as mine ! " cried Capietro , as he looked at his hand . " She will never be yours , " growled the Russian : " What do you mean ? " " I shall win the next two games . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he cried . " We should drink to that . " He raised the bottle to his lips and then passed it to Stabutch . " I do not want a drink , " said the Russian , in a surly tone , pushing the bottle aside . " Ah , ha ! My friend is getting nervous . He is afraid he is going to lose and so he will not drink . Sapristi ! It is all the same to me . I get the brandy and the girl , too . " " Play ! " snapped Stabutch . " You are in a hurry to lose , " taunted Capietro . " To win , " corrected Stabutch , and he did . Now it was the Italian 's turn to curse and rage at luck , and once again the cards were dealt and the players picked up their hands . " It is the last game , " said Stabutch.  | " We have each won two , " replied Capietro . " Let us drink to the winner  --  although I dislike proposinga toast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time there was an ugly note in his laughter . In silence , now , they resumed their play . One by one the little pasteboards fell upon the rug . The girl looked on in wondering silence . There was a tensenessin the situation that she felt , without understanding . Poor little Jezebel , she understood so little ! Suddenly , with a triumphant oath , Capietro sprang to his feet . " I win ! " he cried . " Come , friend , drink with me to my good fortune . " Sullenly the Russian drank , a very long draught this time . There was a sinister gleam in his eye as he handed the bottle back to Capietro . Leon Stabutch was a poor loser . The Italian emptied the bottle and flung it to the ground . Then he turned toward Jezebel and stooping lifted her to her feet . " Come , my dear , " he said , his coarse voice thick from drink , " Give me a kiss . " Jezebel drew back , but the Italian jerked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his . " Leave the girl alone , " growled Stabutch . " Ca n't you see she is afraid of you ? " " What did I win her for ? " demanded Capietro . " To leave her alone ? Mind your own business . " " I 'll make it my business , " said Stabutch . " Take your hands off her . " He stepped forward and laid a hand on Jezebel 's arm . " She is mine by rights anyway . " " What do you mean ?
