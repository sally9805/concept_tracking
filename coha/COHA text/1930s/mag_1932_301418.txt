At No. 30 Broad Street . Manhattan , 100 yards from the New York Stock Exchange and the little grey banking house of J. P. Morgan &; Co. , is Continental Bank &; Trust Co. of New York . One busy day last week a bold thief strolled into Continental Bank and purloined $500,000 in Government bonds from behind a teller 's window . Police and bank officials advanced the startling theory that the thief had fished the bonds out through the grating while the teller was not looking , using a stick with chewing gum on the end . <P> Most bank robberies are not executed so slickly as that . For the twelve months ending last August the American Bankers Association reported that three bank employes , two customers , nine peace officers and 38 gunmen had been killed in bank stickups , 124 persons wounded in the gunplay . In the same period bank robberies throughout the land totaled 631-a record . Gross loss was $3,384,117 . All but 77 of the robberies were committed in broad daylight . <P> Because the business of bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , the National Bureau of Casualty &; Surety Underwriters , embracing most of the companies writing holdup insurance , last week upped its rates , abolished premium discounts on the first $10,000 of coverage for protective installations such as tear gas equipment and redrew the map of U. S. stickup risks . The country is divided into four districts , ranked according to the past record of bank holdups . Banks in small towns &; cities will pay a higher rate than those in big cities except in District No. 1 , the Eastern States . There all banks pay the same ( and the lowest ) rates-$2 per thousand up to $10,000 , above that $1 per thousand . Worst district is No. 4 , comprising Colorado , Arkansas , Oklahoma , Wisconsin , Minnesota , Illinois , Indiana , Ohio and the Missouri Valley States . For holdup insurance in this district a small-town banker will pay ten times as much as he would in the safe &; sane East-$20 per thousand up to $10,000 , $10 per thousand beyond that .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
