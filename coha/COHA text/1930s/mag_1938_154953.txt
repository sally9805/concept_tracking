MARGARET SANGER : AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY - Norton ( $3.50 ) . <P> In 1914 a tuberculous , 30-year-old nurse named Margaret Sanger began publishing singlehanded a feminist paper called the Woman Rebel . Six months later she began raising money for a pamphlet called Family Limitation , the opening gun in her campaign to spread the gospel of Birth Control . <P> She called on Dr. Abraham Brill , just then bringing out a translation of Freud . Dr. Brill asked if she had been psychoanalyzed . " What is psychoanalysis ? " asked Mrs. Sanger . He explained , and then declared that after six weeks of his treatment she would not want to go on with the pamphlet . " Then I wo n't be analyzed , " said Mrs. Sanger . <P> Told last week in Margaret Sanger 's 504-page autobiography , that anecdote was symbolic of her singleminded , 23-year fight against police , courts , churchmen and ridicule to legalize birth control in the U. S. Most of the public highlights of her story-Congressional lobbying , duels with the Catholic Church , her sensational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of India-are well known . But her beginnings-as the sixth of eleven children of a free-thinking tombstone carver in Corning , N. Y. , as a nurse on Manhattan 's lower East Side , and as a central member of the group of famous pre-War radicals which included Walter Lippmann , John Reed , Big Bill Haywood , Mabel Dodge-make the best reading . <P> Margaret Sanger 's autobiography is one of the most dramatic stories in the history of U. S. reform . Last year , when the U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that physicians might send contraceptives by mail , her career became a " success story . " <P> The irony of that story is one that Margaret Sanger is herself the first to see . Behind the applause she hears a rumbling a thousand times more ominous than any that ever came from court or church-a rumbling from Europe 's dictator-ridden countries , which distinctly do not want Birth Control , are much more interested in cannon fodder than in eugenics .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
