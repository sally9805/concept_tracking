The Governor of Washington , the Governor of California and the Governor of Pennsylvania had something in common last week . Each was begged by a celebrated individual from far outside his State 's boundaries to extend executive clemency to a prisoner of his State . The prisoners were a boy , an aging man and a political zealot . In one case , California 's , the plea was publicly resented as an impudent intrusion . In the other two cases public opinion was chiefly favorable to the prisoner and his advocate from afar . <P> Boy . One night last August a peaked 12-year-old named Herbert Niccolls broke into a grocery store at Asotin , in southeastern Washington . Sheriff John L. Wormell , 72 , went into the store after him . From his hiding place behind a pickle barrel , Herbert Niccolls shot &; killed the aged officer . At his trial it was brought out the boy 's father was in a hospital for the criminally insane . Already Herbert was something of a criminal prodigy : at nine he had stolen an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the latter offense he was jailed 15 months , later released in the custody of his grandmother . A rural jury thought Herbert was a fairly hopeless case , felt that he should be locked up in Walla Walla penitentiary for the rest of his life . <P> While Herbert , the youngest prisoner ever to enter the institution , was amusing himself with his harmonica , being kept away from the older felons , a first citizen of Omaha , Neb. became interested in his case . He was Father Edward J. Flanagan . Father Flanagan was born in Roscommon , Ireland , 45 years ago . He entered one of Omaha 's poor parishes in 1913 . The hardships of his own people had accustomed but not blinded him to human misery . In the winter of 1914 he began trying to feed and house a few down- &-outers,; many of them drunkards and criminals . What made them that way ? wondered Father Flanagan . Deciding that the best place to combat human woe is near the beginning of human life , he borrowed $90 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wayward , neglected boys . Since 1917 , Father Flanagan 's Boys ' Home has become a source of pride to Omaha , a model institution for the nation . Through Father Flanagan 's hands have passed 2,984 boys from 36 States . On the Flanagan board of directors are President James Edward Davidson of Nebraska Power Co. , Protestant and Shriner , and Henry Monsky , a leading Omaha lawyer , Jew and Shriner . Proud is Father Flanagan that the footsteps of none of his boys , many of them handed over to him by the courts , have ever led to jail or prison . <P> Not above helping his Home along with a bit of publicity , Father Flanagan broadcasts his boys ' band , gets celebrities to visit the institution , among them : Tom Mix , * Admiral Byrd , Paul Whiteman , Babe Ruth , Jack Dempsey , Will Rogers . With a fanfare from the local Press , Father Flanagan got up from his sick bed fortnight ago and set out for Seattle to plead with Governor Roland Hartley for Herbert Niccolls ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to back my reputation of years of work that I can aid this boy to become a useful citizen . . . . No boy of twelve can be a murderer at heart . . . . I now have the pleasure of watching a 10-year-old lad at our Home , also once charged and convicted of murder , developing into a fine specimen of American boyhood . "
