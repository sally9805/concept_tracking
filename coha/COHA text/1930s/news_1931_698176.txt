An investigation begun by Fire Commissioner Dorman , Assistant Fire Chief John J. and Fire Marshal Thomas Brophy , before the embers of the building had smoldered out , showed that the fire probably had begun accidentally in the Ring flat on the third floor . According to Marshal Brophy , Ring was aroused from his sleep by the cries of his son , Philip . Running into Philip 's bedroom , the father discovered that the room was filled with smoke . As he emerged from the bedroom , he saw a fire in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were heard by Albert Hecht of 79 Avenue C , who was in a near-by barber shop . Hecht rushed through the smoke-filled strairways to the Ring flat and assisted Ring , his wife and son and two daughters , Sylvia , 16 , and Madeline , 13 , to the street level . Undaunted by the fact that the flames by this time had begun to work their way down to the lower floors as well as to the roof , Hecht rushed back into the building and assisted an entire family by the name of Shapiro , living on the fourth floor , to get to the fire escape , thence to the street . By this time the smoke and flames were so intense that Hecht had to abandon further attempts at rescue work . Mr. Fassler and Mr. Neustein were standing at the corner of Eighth Street and Avenue C , a block away , - when the fire started . Both officials ran into the building and carried several children from the upper floors to the street via the fire escapes .

Meanwhile , firemen had surrounded the block and were fighting the flames with water towers and with fire hoses mounted on the roofs of adjoining tenements . Some of the firemen quickly hoisted ladders against the walls of the blazing building , down which they carried many parents and children . Other firemen led the hysterical occupants down the fire escapes . Another hero was Frank Lombardo , 21 years old , a brother-in-law of Mrs. Di Blasi , who was asleep in a penthouse on the roof when the fire started . He rescued two of the DI Biasi children .
