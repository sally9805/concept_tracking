In 1817 , Canada 's Price Bros . &; Co. began a mighty career in lumber , later branched into paper . Its own printed currency was long accepted locally as legal tender . Were Price Bros. banknotes circulating today they would find few takers . Competetive ferocity in a traditionally ferocious industry ground down newsprint prices from the post-War $110 per ton to a Depression $40 . Short on profitable U. S. contracts , long on overhead , Price Bros. defaulted interest payments on its bonds in 1932 . Promptly mustered was a bondholders ' protective committee chairmanned by Boston 's W. ( for Willard ) Eugene McGregor , who had been with Harris , Forbes &; Co. when that banking house marketed the Price Bos. bonds to the public . Last week Banker McGregor earned the rare distinction of having protected his bondholders so well that they will get 100 on the dollar and back interest to boot . <P> After it defaulted , Price Bros. had a short period of grace to make good . Knowing there were only some $11,000,000 of bonds out against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timber , two newsprint mills capable of 1,100 tons daily , the bondholders ' committee prepared to hang on . Meanwhile many a potent user and producer of newsprint eyed the ailing company 's assets with interest . When the bankruptcy ax finally fell eight months later , officers began to appear from such sources as Britain 's Bowater 's Paper Mills Ltd. , a syndicate headed by Montreal 's Robert Oliver Sweezey , newsprint users like Lord Beaverbrook , Lord Rothermere and William Randolph Hearst . For three years outside interests proposed and counterproposed , stockholders and creditors wrangled among themselves and with outsiders . Most likely plan was offered in 1934 by Bowater 's acting for a Beaverbrook . Bondholders were offered new bonds for principal and cash for the interest . Banker McGregor 's committee thought this fair enough . The Plan fell through , however , when stubborn preferred stockholders blocked approval . Still undaunted , Banker McGregor dug in again and waited . By this time , because of his insistent demands for 100 on the dollar , the dogged banker had earned the title " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stockholders ' mulishness had saved , ironically enough , every stitch of the bondseller 's shirts . <P> During the past few months , gains in business volume* have lofted hopes that Price Bros , may soon be in the black again . Fortnight ago a new combination jumped into the picture . Front for this group was a new company called Pacona Ltd. , sponsored by the Manhattan firm of Lehman Bros. , and Canadian affiliates of Aluminum Co. of America , including Saguenay Power Co. , Price 's largest unsecured creditor . Pacona 's offer was the answer to a protective committee 's dream : cash for principal , back interest and all committee expenses .
