To say that college does something to the average student 's religion is to state a truth which will be conceded by anyone who has given the matter a moment 's thought . Nine young men and women out of every ten who will receive their degrees this June would probably admit , if they were called to testify , that education has acted as a poison to their faith . In many instances the virus generated by the reasoning processes induces only a mild distemper of skepticism , but in others it works like an acid , eating its way into the bump of credulity until in the end this estimable organ is completely corroded . Devout parents and clergymen have frequently observed this phenomenon and deplored it . When they discuss it , however , as they often do , they betray a common failure to understand the intellectual chemistry which has produced this wholesale apostasy of the younger generation . In these pages I propose to show how higher education reacts upon faith by describing my own religious crisis just as it occurred while I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good reason to sift my doubts with unusual care . When I entered Harvard in the fall of 1924 , I was not only a Christian , I was also an avowed candidate for the ministry . Then for four years I underwent a process of mental readjustment which shook my little world to its foundations . Through it all only one thing was clear to me : if I could reconcilereligion with intelligence , I knew that I could go on into my chosen career fortified by the experience ; if I could not , every consideration of honor would compel me to make other plans . In the end I gave up the ministry . Because my crisis was so acute , I know what fundamental questions underlie the intellectual reorientation which has become an inevitable part of the college curriculum for every thinking student . From my own experience I can demonstrate why it is that education so often spells the end of orthodoxy . I The environment in which I grew up was that of the typical middle-class American home just after the turn of the century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into the world , but her spirit lived on and was the tutelary genius of my childhood and youth . I was born a good Presbyterian , and , fittingly enough , predestination played an important role in my early life . Both of my parents were gentle , unaffected , devoted Christians , and my father was an elder in the church . We lived in a small city of the Middle West , on the fringe of what H. L. Mencken calls the Bible Belt . ' Long before I could be aware of it myself , the double accident of parentage and geography had shaped me for the service of God . Our neighborhood was made up of families like mine . All social life was centred in the church and its activities . Our minister , who was an intimate friend of the family , was an upright old Scotsman , a living monument to all the Christian virtues . He had served our parish almost as long as anybody could remember , and his never-failing kindliness and charity made him universally beloved . My earliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular feature of our daily life . After supper we would retire to the library , where my father , with , wife and children gathered about him , would read a chapter from the Scriptures . Psalms and Proverbs were his favorite books , and he repeated them so often that I soon knew them by heart . After the reading came prayers , during which each little event of the day would be rehearsed and we would give thanks to God for all the good things we had enjoyed . It was natural that a child brought up in such a home should early come to think of the God who ruled over it , whose presence was so imminently felt in every department of daily life , as one of his most intimate acquaintances . He was very real , this God of my childhood ; as real as my father , and in fact quite like him . There was nothing sinister about Him , nothing to incite fear ? except , of course , when I disobeyed Him . He was merely the head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ways of both were often inscrutable to me , but I never doubted their ultimate wisdom and their concern for my own good . By the time I came to the age of reason the system under which I had grown up had implanted in my mind certain clear ideas about the universe and my place in it . The world was created by God as a laboratory for testing human beings . In the Bible He had revealed His commandments , which were distinct , direct , and ad mitted of no argument . Obedience to these injunctions was virtue , disobedience sin . The one meant honor and happiness and life everlasting ; the other was the way of shame and disgrace in this world , and led to eternal torments in the world to come . God , however , was more than a moralist . He was also an engineer . The world which He had fashioned was not an automatic mechanism . It had been set going in the beginning by its Creator , and He , like a good mechanic , had been tinkering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were direct manifestations of His power . ' The heavens declare the glory of God ; and the firmament sheweth his handywork . ' If He could save men from their sins , He could also protect them against acci dents , diseases , and the shafts of their enemies . Faith and good works , then , were not only the way of the soul 's salvation , they were also the best kind of insurance against the stings of fortune while one lived . These religious concepts were laid down in the Scriptures and were supported by a kind of evidence in everyday life . God was constantly being moved by the prayers of the just to repeat in our day the miracles He had performed in ancient times . Everyone who had eyes could see it for himself . Did not our pastor often intercede for the recovery of the sick , and did they not usually get well ? Did he not pray every Sunday that the President of the United States would be given wisdom to lead the affairs of the nation , and was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple and all very right , and surely the way of the transgressor was hard . But , you say , these were the ideas of a child . True , and the child got them from his parents , who shared them item by item with , the neighbors , who held // the same beliefs in common with one hundred million other people in all the Middletown of America . II It would hardly be possible to exaggerate the importance of a wonder-working God in this Christian scheme of things which I took for granted with the air I breathed . Innumerable stories from the Bible , moreover , indicate that such a Deity was also taken for granted by every one of the Scriptural heroes from Adam down to John of Patmos . Through all the centuries of religious history this idea has persisted , which would seem to indicate that a God who kicks over the traces of natural law and upsets the normal sequence of cause and effect occupies an important place ? if not , indeed , the central place ? in Christian cosmology . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clergy are disposed to pass lightly over the miracles . This tendency , however , is wholly confined to the more liberal Ichurches , whose communicants are sophisticated people . Such parishes are not really representative of Christianity , for the obvious reason that their members are not representative of the rank and file of humanity . Sophisticated folk , if they go to church at all , tend to do it as a matter of form and fashion ; they are moved by no strong convictions . To find the original God of Christianity still resplendent in all His glory , still hurling His thunderbolts and making no concessions to rationalism , one should go preferably to a Roman Catholic Church ? to the shrine , say , of Saint Anne de Beaupre or Our Lady of Lourdes . There one comes into the awful presence of a real God , who heals the sick , gives sight to the blind , makes the crippled walk , rewards the just , damns the wicked , and in all the vicissitudes of life is able to give tangible evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deity , less colorful , perhaps , but no less real , will be found among the Baptists , the Lutherans , the Methodists , the Congregationalists , the Presbyterians , and every other sect of Protestantism . This was the God of my childhood . And He still reigns in undimmed majlesty over the lives of millions , whose supplications continue to move Him just as effectively as they did in the days of Abraham . Here , for example , is a testimonial taken from the Chicago Tribune of August 28 last : ? The steeple of the Presbyterian Theological Seminary , at 2330 North Halsted Street , was struck by lightning and set afire . One hundred and seventy-five theological students , residents of a near-by dormitory , rushed into the street in a downpour of rain to help the firemen fight the blaze . Dr. John Timothy Stone , president of the Seminary , heard the crash when the steeple was struck . He rushed out into the storm and called upon the students who were helping to fight the blaze to pray . Dr. Stone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer for the safety of the building . The firemen were unable to get into the steeple , and by the time they had raised a fire tower and trained a hose on the fire an hour later the rain had put out the blaze . It is hardly necessary to point out that Dr. Stone 's action was entirely consistent with his beliefs as a good Presbyterian . In his moment of danger he did what every religious man or woman does instinctively under similar circumstances : he appealed to the wonder-working God who presides over the Christian universe . And I dare say the good Doctor has already used the incident to point the moral in some stirring sermon . I emphasize the importance of this deleted material // ber evening in 1924 , I called to say good-bye to the old minister , who , throughout his long friendship with the family , had been almost a second father to me . In the quiet of his study he knelt beside me and offered up a fervent petition to God to make me diligent in the pursuit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was dead and was spared the pain of learning that his parting prayer was being answered ? in a sense the irony of which he could never have understood . In the course of time the impact of new knowledge , and especially knowledge of science and the scientific method , wrought great havoc with my original ideas . All things , it seemed , were subject to the laws of nature . This concept supplied my mind with a wholly new pattern into which my religious beliefs refused to fit . In such an orderly universe there seemed to be no place for a wonder-working God . He would be an outlaw , unthinkable and impossible . The bottom dropped out of my world , and I wrestled with myself in a futile attempt to patch it up . What , then , about morals ? Without an omnipotent Deity to reward virtue and punish evil , was the good life ' only an illusion ? I could not believe it , yet I could think of no satisfactory answer . Life had lost its meaning . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God by setting Him up as the First Cause ? the moving power behind natural law . But there was small comfort in this thought . A God who had created the world and then left it to govern itself by natural law had hedged Himself about by barriers through which even He could not break . Prayers could not move Him . Though He might exist , He could not be of service to man . Obviously such a God would be too remote , too inaccessible , for the purposes of religion . I saw , too , that the Modernists were troubled by these same difficulties . In their haste to strike up a compromise with the intellectuals , they were trying hard to make a self-respecting Deity out of the nebulous What-Is-It of Eddington and Millikan . It seemed to me that they had fallen between two stools . I studied philosophy and read further about this First Cause . Then I began to marvel at the disingenuousness of the human mind when , unable to imagine how the world began , but demanding some explanation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alphabet and call g-o-d an answer . I preferred to think that we know more about such matters when we admit we know nothing than when we resort to such palpable self-deception . While I was debating these problems so basic to my religious beliefs , the controversy between Fundamentalists and Modernists was coming to a head , and the impending Scopes trial in Tennessee was shocking the conscience of thoughtful men everywhere . These events helped to clarify my thinking . I saw that the battle had been joined between religion and intelligence . Was ) faith , then , simply a defense of igno-lrance , a substitute for thinking ? In the summer of 1925 , I followed the proceedings at Dayton with intense interest , and one aspect of the dispute over evolution struck me particularly . Learned scientists and liberal clergymen were brought to testify for the defense . Their evidence was not admitted at the trial , as I recall it , but all of them gave out statements to the press , and they were unanimous in say , ing that there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me as a downright evasion of the issue . The quarrel was not between religion and science in the abstract . The pious legislators of Tennessee had taken it upon themselves to protect one specific and clearly stated postulate of Christianity against the equally concrete and definite theory of evolution . What was the conflict here ? The controversy raged , as everyone knows , over the first chapter of Genesis . Now why should religious folk set such store by that text ? In explaining how the world was created in six days , the story of Genesis clearly established God in the central conning tower of the universe and conferred upon Him the omnipotent powers He needed to control the mechanism . Thus it affirmed the first great postulate of Christianity : An all-powerful God rules over the world of His creation . But that is not all . From this premise is derived a corollary of the first importance to religion : Man is ? dependent for his safety in this world and his salvation in the next upon the God who made him . Here , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation . The lawmakers of Tennessee maintained , therefore , that the story was fundamental to Christianity , and in this it would appear that they were better theologians ( however tenuous their claim to greatness in the law ) than the liberal clergymen who tried to refute them . For the Christian religion rests in large part upon the foundation of those assumptions laid down in the first chapter of Getweis . ' The moral code is directly derived from the special relationship there established between God and man . Now what happens to this nicely rationalized system of religious beliefs when scientific notions are suPerimposed upon them ? The God of Christianity becomes enclosed in a circle of natural law from which He can not escape . He is deprived of His freedom to interfere with the normal sequence of cause and effect . He is no longer able to play the role of Cosmic Policeman , meting out vengeance and punishment to evildoers and offering protection and rewards to the just . The elaborate sanctions which religion has built up to enforce its code vanish into thin air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict If this statement is challenged on the ground that it ignores the immense contribution of Jesus , I answer that Jesus would have been impossible without the God who first makes His appearance in Genesis . Without such a God , it is obvious that there could never have been a Son of God . ? Aumon WHAT COLLEGE DI of primary importance is set up between Christianity and scientific ideas . Mystic rites , sacrifice , supplication , and prayer are typical modes of religious behavior , and they are conditioned by religious beliefs . People who have oriented themselves to a scientific universe go about their affairs in other ways . Dr. John Timothy Stone and the firemen approached their common problem differently . Having reached these conclusions , I realized that if I was to continue to believe in the good life I should have to look beyond the teachings of orthodoxy for my reasons . The supernatural had become meaningless . No longer able to lean upon the gods , I must learn to stand alone . V It so happened that I stayed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I first entered Harvard as a freshman . Meanwhile , I had written innumerable letters to my parents , acquainting them with all the successive changes which my ideas had undergone . They were sorely troubled . At first they contented themselves with giving me well-intentioned advice ' to pray and read my Bible constantly . If I did this , my doubts would surely pass , for God was testing me and would not desert me if I proved steadfast . When at last , toward the end of my sophomore year , I wrote them that prayer had lost its meaning , they concluded that they would have to take heroic measures to save me from myself . I received a long letter from my father . He was now convinced , he said , that my going to Harvard had been a ghastly mistake . Two years of it threatened to destroy the faith which had been instilled into me from birth . If I continued in my present course , he could never forgive himself for failing // to heed the advice of our old pastor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' For what shall it profit a man , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ? ' He was convinced , therefore , that it would be best for me to plan on not returning to Cambridge in the fall . If I preferred , he would be willing to let me do nothing at all the next year ; I could stay at home and get my bearings anew . After that I could make a fresh start and go on with my studies at the Presbyterian college in Missouri , which he had now concluded was the proper place for me . Of course I was no longer a child to be governed wholly by others ; I should have to make my own decisions and take the consequences . But in this important matter he urged me to consider well and be guided by his maturer judgment . Needless to say , this letter was very disturbing to me . I could understand and sympathize with my father 's feelings . But , much as I regretted to displease him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote him to this effect and begged him to allow me to complete the studies which I had begun . I had seen enough of a progressive university and its methods of stimulating students to think for themselves to know that I should never be able to bear the hothouse environment of a denominational college . After the interchange of several letters my father finally capitulated , although he said it went sorely against his conscience . That third year at Harvard was much less distressing to my peace of mind than the first two had been . The uncertainties which new knowledge had bred no longer paralyzed me . Other certainties began to take form as I set about building up a tenable philosophy of my own . By the end of my junior year these ideas had begun to shake down and adjust themselves to the new pattern which my mind had accepted . It was now out of the question for me to entertain any hope that I might be able to reconcile my new philosophy of life with those religious assumptions which I had formerly taken for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ter . Instead , I found myself strongly / attracted toward an academic career . But I was still enrolled as a candidate for holy orders , and it was incumbent upon me to notify Presbytery of my withdrawal . Back home our old pastor was dead , and a younger man who had formerly assisted him had taken his place . So to him I wrote , in April 1927 , outlining the change in my beliefs just as I have explained it here , and asking him to lay the matter before Presbytery . Within a few days I received his answer . His letter was cordial and tolerant , but it demonstrated so conclusively the impotence of the Church to deal with , or even to understand , the problem of my generation that I shall quote it in full . April 16 , 1927 MY DEAR PHILIP , Your father has frequently talked with me about your difficulties . I was therefore not unprepared for your letter , although the Philip who speaks in these pages is an altogether different Philip from the one who left us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you how sorry I am that you have had to go through this crisis . Most of us , some time or other in our college lives , have had to face the very problems that are yours . If a man thinks at all , such  --  questions are bound to torment him sooner or later . Knowing you as I do , I am sure ? that you have been honest in facing them . Still , it is the way a man answers that really matters ; his doubts may always either make him or break him . I shall not attempt to debate the points which you have raised . You ought to know already how faith can move such mountains of doubt as the unguided reason may build up . There is only one thought that I should like to place before you . As you have been looking at the fact of Christianity from the point of view of a personal God , have you been absolutely fair in seeking the proof on both sides ? By that I mean , have you been ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or have you just taken the external view that it can not be so , and tried to prove that by your thought and reading ? Not one of us could keep his faith in any vital mat ' ter if he listened only to those who argue against it . Religion is n't a question of logic or reason , although there is logic in it Sid T. man has to have a reason for the faith that is within him . However , I am not going to harass you with a sermon . I want you to know that whatever you do and wherever you go I still count you one of my true friends . Whether it means anything to you or not , I am going to pray for God 's blessing upon you , that He may lead you out into the fullest life . You are still numbered here as one of ours , and always will be . If at any time I can serve you in any way , you have only to let me know . And be assured of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faithfully , etc . There is something very touching in the manifest sincerity of such an appeal . But what good is it to urge a man to pray when the whole system of religious conceptions has lost its validity for him ? In 1928 , I took my degree from Harvard . Four years have now elapsed since then , and my ideas have undergone no important modification . Subsequent studies have confirmed me in the point of view which I have , indicated here , and I remain irretrievably lost to religion . This is a source of permanent chagrin to my family . The years have tended to cover over the wound , to the extent that we never discuss the difference in our opinions ; but underneath the tacit'acceptance of our disagreement I know that my // parents nurse a secret hurt too deep for time to heal . In their prayers and meditations I am sure that while they live they will not cease to plead with their God for my redemption . Thus it will appear from my little history that we members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitable consequence of America 's generous passion for education . Thousands of young men and women go to college each year from homes more or less like mine , to return changed beyond recognition in all their ideas . And a few thoughtful appraisers of our social trends , men like James Truslow Adams and Walter Lippmann , who are not believers themselves , seem to agree with clergymen and the more devout parents in thinking that the transformation is not always a change for the better . In this they are probably right . College not only may , but often does , deprive a student of his religious convic ' , , tions without giving him anything to take their place . Christianity , after all , is a composite of two elements : one purports to explain the nature of the world and man 's relationship to the God who rules over it ; the other prescribes a course of conduct the sanctions of which are &lived; from this relationship . The really serious dangers of skepticism become apparent when a student rejects the supernatural part of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for decent conduct . Robbedof standards , he is likely to adopt the easy ethics of business , which permit a man to do almost anything so long as it leads to success in money-making . This commercial point of view is rapidly becoming the rea 1 ) 11 -- iilosophy of the nation , as Mr. Adams brilliantly demonstrates in The Epic of America . If a life of pure acquisitiveness becomes the ideal of college students , they can find reasons to justify themselves in some of the new theories of psychology . These doctrines tend to glorify the illimitable expansion of the ego as ' self-expression , ' and create in uncritical ? m-th-di-the notion that it is foolish , even harmful to health , to try to suppress one 's desires ? a favorite dogma of Freud and the psychoanalysts . In this connection it seems to me very strange that , despite our cult I of science , we have not yet grasped the full import of the new knowledge that has come to us from the laboratory . The usefulness of the physical sciences is measured ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces of nature . Control is the essence of scientific purpose . But the new psychology , calling itself a science , has supplemented the decay of religion to rob us of control over human nature ? that is , over our appetites . One solution of this dilemma may lie in the creation of a philosophy which , without calling upon the supernatural , will reassert the effectiveness of the human will as an instrument for governing the desires and impulses . Then it will be possible yo restore to good odor the essentially human values of life which lift us above the level of mere animal instinct. , The system of ethics which would be enforced by such a philosophy would not be strikingly different in many particulars from the moral code of Christianity , but the reasons for obeying it would be found wholly in the satisfactions of the good life itself , not in tie promise of reward or punishment after death . But only a congenital optimist could bring himself to believe that a mere system of ethfcs , lowever satisfying to the intellect , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most men and women are incapable of sustained self-control . Greed , pride , lust , are too much for them . They can be held to the path of duty only by some power outside themselves ? some higher authority which is able to generate repressive fears stronger than their native passions . Over vast multitudes the Church has for centuries enforced an external discipline of precisely this kind . When religion begins to lose its hold upon the minds of men , as it is now doing with us , a peculiar thing happens . The Church is driven by its own weakness to shift its social responsibilities to other shoulders . Now there is only one other institution strong enough to take on new burdens in such an emergency , and it is an institution which , like the Church , has always been engaged in forcing a measure of parental control upon men who Either would not or could not control themselves . This is the State . As religion becomes inoperative , governments are overworked . In America at the present moment there is ample evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acute stage . The ineffec tiveness of Christianity as a social force is revealed , on the one hand , in an outbreak of crime the seriousness of which is common knowledge ; and the government has not yet been able to devise satisfactory measures for dealing with it . The Church , on the other hand , aware of its weakness , aware that it can no longer command obedience to its teachings by the time-honored method of invoking the wrath of God , is led to lean more and more heavily upon the State , borrowing secular support for purely religious injunctions . The sad plight of Christianity in Tennessee , which has had to call upon the law for official protection against evolution , is a symbol of spiritual decadence . National prohibition is another sign of the same thing writ ' large . Thus for some years the churches have been abdicating in
