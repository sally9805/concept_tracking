txt So far as Tammany is concerned , the city election has taken on the appearance of desperate efforts by it to maintain its power as an " organization . " Rival organizers are now in the field and are eating into its strength . The managers of the campaign declare that they are going into every Assembly district to establish a party machine of their own to which discouraged and disgruntled members of Tammany Hall may resort . Many of them are doing it already . Their open revolt , including several men of high Tammany standing hitherto , , is a fair indication that great numbers who see no reason to advertise their purpose are leaving the sinking Tammany ship . The Tammany leadership is obviously both alarmed and rattled . But note the method of fighting the bolters which it adopts . It is all made a question of offices and salaries . If any officeholder refuses to support Mayor O'BRIEN , his resignation is at once demanded , and if he does not resign he will be removed . This is the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In connection with this process of proscription we have just had a remarkable series of statements from the City Hall . On Thursday the Mayor scouted the idea that he would cut off the heads of supporters holding lucrative offices in the Bronx and elsewhere . But yesterday Mr. GOLDMAN , Commissioner of the Department of Plant and Structures , made public the fact that Mayor O'BRIEN had sent for him and demanded his resignation . But since no charge of incompetence or inefficiency was made , he refused to resign . When this fact was brought to the attention of the Mayor , he admitted that he had sent for Commissioner GotnmAN , but denied that he had " literally " called upon him to resign . He had merely pointed out that no member of his " Cabinet " hostile to his candidacy could be expected to hold office . This was a verbal defense worthy of the acute mind of Chairman FARLEY . When he was asked if the resolution passed by the State Committee bound him and all the others to support the regular Democratic ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That depends upon how you look at it . " How the ordinary citizen looks at all this pulling and hauling and tergiversation can hardly be doubted . He must see that one set of machine politicians is striving to oust another . In the struggle between competing " organizations , " the welfare and future of the city are dropping out of sight . While all this blare of trumpets is going on , trying to rally unthinking and frightened Democrats to the party which claims to have the best opportunity for political power and the spoils of office , it will not be forgotten that there is another movement which is nonpartisan and which is bending all its efforts to give New York an honest and efficient Government . No one can yet tell how the votes in the three-cornered contest will be divided . But while the rival Democratic leaders are attacking each other and trying to outbid each other , the merits and promise of the Fusion campaign ought to have a better chance of getting a serious hearing by the people of this city .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
