THE MENACE A STORY BY DON MARQUIS ccrrixrRE 's too much salt in my I broth , " said Miss Maisie Robinson . She flounced her great bulk about in her canopied bed and picked crossly at the neck of her wrapper . " You know the doctors say that salt increases my blood pressure , " she continued in a peevish whine . She flounced again , deliberately disarranging her bed covering and kicking a rubber hot water bag to the floor . " It looks as if you wanted me to die , Elvira , " she said , on the verge of maudlin tears . " Of course I do n't want you to die , Maisie , " said her sister Elvira patiently . She cried a little herself at the imputation . " You 're all I 've got left , " added Elvira . " Except Planty , " said Maisie . The two words were accompanied by a glance which carried some sort of threat with it , a threat which Elvira understood and responded to . Planty was her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good many years . She cowered under Maisie 's look and mention of Planty 's name . " Yes , you 're all I 've got except Planty , " she breathed . There was a kind of appeal , an appeal for mercy , in her tone and manner . She picked up the hot water bag and put it back at her sister 's feet . " If I told Planty . . . " said Maisie , the invalid , and kicked the hot water bag to the floor again . " Do n't ! " choked Elvira and crossed her hands on her breast , as if there might be some protection to the heart beneath in their thin feebleness . " Some day I will ! " said Maisie , watching the quiver which always shook the other woman at the menace . They were both old women  --  the fat old invalid woman in the bed and the worn gray old sister over whom she had tyrannized for years , who stood beside it meekly and listened to continual complaints and replied with disregarded apologies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitantly : " It was only day before yesterday , Maisie , when I made chicken broth for you , that you said there was n't enough salt in it . " " There was n't , Elvira , " replied the invalid . She lifted her eyes to the canopy above the bed and remarked , as if making an impersonal comment to some recording angel who might have perched himself up there , " You 'd think that in all these years a person might have learned a little thing like putting the right amount of salt in soup  --  just enough , and not too much nor too little . " Mrs. Plantaganet Brown sighed . She ventured again , greatly daring , " You could salt it yourself , you know , Maisie . I could cook it without salt , if you 'd let me , and you could put in just the right amount . " " Of course I wo n't let you cook it without salt , " said Maisie . " Salt should be cooked with food , and not put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemical difference , which has a great effect on the patient 's metabolism . But what do you care about my metabolism ? " Maisie had at her command many such words as metabolism , which she had picked up from generations of physicians and specialists , and which she used now and then to lay her sister flat in the dust . " I do care about your metabolism , Maisie , " said Elvira . " No you do n't , " affirmed Maisie . " And you do n't know anything about it , either , I should think you 'd have learned something about metabolism by this timer But you never read anything . You do n't keep up with the times . I 'm left at the mercy of your deliberate and willful ignorance . " " Not deliberate , " said Mrs. Plantaganet Brown humbly . " Not willful . " " Deliberate ! " insisted Maisie . " Willful ! " She was so explosive that the tom-cat , who was lying in the sun in the window-seat , stirred and looked over at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever since he was a kitten , but there was no way of finding out in detail just what he thought of them . His air was one of general disdain of humanity . He regarded it aloofly , loftily , from the heights of an animal and feline aristocracy . Human beings , he seemed to consider , were common . They ministered to his needs , and that was all they were for , and otherwise they were not very interesting . Generations of tom-cats had inhabited the house with the sisters through the long stretches of the years , and they had all sooner or later acquired this air of careless disdain . Mrs. Plantaganet Brown had to cook and wait upon these cats also . Maisie was particular about the wayin which her cats were cared for . There were servants , but Maisie made Elvira wait on her and the cats with Elvira 's own hands . And if things were not just exactly right out would come the threat , " I 'll tell Plantyl " And instantly Elvira was more abject than ever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually sat in the same room also ; but as nobody could ever be quite sure whether he was asleep or awake , neither the sisters nor the cats took the initiative in calling themselves to his attention . He sat dozing in his chair , generally with a walking stick in his hand , and his head held upright by a high , stiff white collar . He looked rather like a sculptor 's idea of An Old Gentleman Who Did Not Want To Be Disturbed . The fact that he was somewhat deaf was a help to him in keeping from his consciousness anything which threatened to be agitating . He wore a sort of telephone arrangement , with tubes plugged into his ears and a receiver lying flat on his chest . Whenever he heard anything which threatened his mental calm Planty pulled the plugs out of his ears , closed his eyes , and either went to sleep or pretended that he was asleep . The house in which they lived was a very large one situated on Brooklyn Heights , overlooking a part of the harbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , lower Manhattan . Planty had been born in the house and had inherited it , far back in the Nineteenth Century , along with a great deal of money . He had not added greatly to his fortune ; and on the other hand he had lost none of it . Planty had never been very active . He had always been a very conservative man even as a young fellow ; solid , on the side of law and order and the conventions , a respectable citizen . Being that , and writing letters to the newspapers , which he signed " Tax-payer , " " Pro Bono Publico , " and " Aroused Citizen , " had taken up most of Planty 's time . Although there were dozens of rooms in the house , Maisie 's sick room was where the three of them usually sat . Maisie did not like to be alone , and she considered that she was persecuted if she was left alone . Planty , even with his deafness and his somnolence , could scarcely escape the knowledge that there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maisie 's bed . But he had no idea of the terrible , petty little drama which lay behind it . And no faintest notion that he himself existed at the very center of this drama , was the pivot about which it revolved . These intense and passionate episodes of domestic tyranny and terror were enacted daily , hourly , before his very face and he did not realize them . These old people were now living in the fourth decade of the Twentieth Century . Some time during the last decades of the Nineteenth Century , Elvira  --  Mrs. Plantaganet Brown  --  had committed an indiscretion . Her sister Maisie knew all about it , and she had used the knowledge to make a trembling slave of her sister . " I 'll tell Planty ! " Maisie would say . And Elvira would blanch and quiver . Sometimes the threat would be in a whisper . Often Maisie would accentuate it by raising her voice a trifle . Then Elvira would suffer agonies . For there was Planty himself , not twenty feet away , looking out at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been having frequent quarrels as to just when Elvira 's scarlet sin had been committed . " It was at the time of the Philadelphia Centennial , in 1876 , " Maisie would say . " It was not . It was at the time of the Chicago World 's Fair , in 1893 , " Elvira would return , firmly  --  or with as much firmness as she ever dared toexhibit in any controversy with Maisie . " It was the time of the Philadelphia Centennial . I remember very well when you came to me , in an agony of remorse and contrition , and told me all . You said you could no longer bear the knowledge alone ; that it was killing you . " " It was at the Chicago World 's Fair . I guess I know when it was ! " " Your memory is failing . You are getting so old . " " I am two years younger than you are ! " " It was at the Philadelphia Centennial , and the man was from Kentucky . " " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginian . " " Do n't keep contradicting me or it will bring on one of my spells . And if you bring on one of my spells I 'll tell Planty ! " " Listen , Maisie  --  it was at the Chicago World 's Fair . In 1876 I was only twenty years old , and Planty and I had only been married a year or so . Why , I was a bride , and of course nothing of the sort happened then ! Do n't make me out worse than I am , Maisie ! " " You were still young and flighty in 1893 ? you were only 37 ? and there may have been a repetition of your deadly sin , for all I know . " " Oh , Maisie ! You talk as if I were a ... a . . . a Bad Woman ! " " I should n't know what else to call you , whether it was the Philadelphia Exposition or the Chicago World 's Fair ! " " Why do n't you go on and bring in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in 1900 . " " It was in 1901 . " " Very well , then ; have it your own way  --  it was in 1901 . " " I know it was 1901 , because it was the same year that Queen Victoria died . " " Queen Victoria did n't die in 1901 . " " I guess I know better than you do ! " And pretty soon Maisie would begin to cry and say , " Do n't bully me this way just because I 'm a helpless invalid . I 'll tell Planty . " Often Maisie would send Elvira to the branch of the Public Library near them for books , and Elvira would blush when she asked for them . For they were all books about lively and iniquitous ladies  --  memoirs , biographies  --  the DuBarry and her sisterhood . Mrs. Plantaganet Brown was aware that the genteel assistant at the library desk had been looking at her askance for some years . These things get about in Brooklyn . More disconcerting even was Maisie 's insistence that Elvira read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventuress was most like Elvira . " Do n't blush so when you read , " Maisie would say . " Planty will see you and begin to suspect ! " Elvira , if she had ever looked like one of these flaming ladies , had long ago lost the look . She was a sweetly gentle old soul , faded and subdued . But perhaps she might , after many years , have missed it a little if her sister had ceased to threaten her with telling Planty . Maisie was acute . She suddenly perceived one day a new possibility of torture . " I think , " she said , " you like being an adventuress ! " " Maisie ! " " As long as Planty does n't find out , you hug your secret to your breast in glee ! " Maisie 's diction occasionally resembled the style of some of the cheaper works which she habitually perused . " You love to flaunt your sins ! " She had a way of speaking to Elvira , when they were both well along in their seventies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair . " I do n't know why I have protected you from Planty for so long . It makes me guilty , too  --  protecting you ! What I have sacrificed to you  --  and all thegratitude I get for itl Besides the moral degradation of living with a woman of your character all these years . " Elvira went to luncheon one day at the St. George Hotel alone , and Maisie pretended to think she had probably met a man there . In fact , Mrs. Plantaganet Brown could not go to the street and come back again but that her sister would say to her , with a tone and look of meaning , " Did you meet anyone interesting ? " One day Elvira looked out at the great bulk of the Statue of Liberty and it rather reminded her of Maisie . The right arm is drawn back as if to throw something , and the hand holds a torch . There would be an explosion somewhere , Elvira thought , when that torch was thrown . Maisie had been standing poised , brandishing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Elvira which began to ache for the explosion , for the catastrophe . But every time she thought of deliberately provoking it , getting the strain over , perishing beneath the stroke and having done with it , she receded from the idea . Habit was too strong ! She had been fearful too long a time . And she feared for Planty too . She thought the revelation , after all these years , might kill him . Shock him to death . Planty , in spite of his precautions , did not get through the world without annoyances . He was annoyed when the ships tied up at the waterfront , just a little way from his western windows , began to burn oil instead of coal ; the smoke left a greasy smear over everything . He had been annoyed when sailing vessels gave place to steam . He could remember when he was a boy seeing the famous old clipper ships out there , their bowsprits thrust up at the windows ; some of them had belonged to his father and to his grandfather . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built . It made it too easy for Brooklyn people to get to New York , and it brought too many New York people to Brooklyn . Planty did not care for New York people very much . They were a wild set , he considered . But , now , in this Twentieth Century , it was getting so that you could scarcely tell New York people and Brooklyn people apart . It was disconcerting . He did n't know what the world was coming to . Right next door to him , in one of the old houses , lived an artist ; and Planty had been careful not to make this gentleman 's acquaintance . The artist gave parties to which other artists came  --  some of them from New York , Planty suspected . They were not noisy parties ; but Planty and Elvira and Maisie lived in fear that they might become noisy at any moment . Who wants artists and such people in the neighborhood anyhow ? They are the next thing to anarchists . Planty did n't know what Brooklyn Heights was coming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing he could do about it . It was all the fault of this Twentieth Century , he felt vaguely . He resented the Twentieth Century as a personal affront . It had taken his family a long time to get used to the Nineteenth Century , but they had , with Planty 's generation , finally settled themselves into it very comfortably  --  and then , suddenly , it had been whisked away from Planty . And what was offered him in place of it ? A queer promiscuous kind of era , with its values all jumbled , which he thoroughly distrusted . Planty was in the habit of going over and staring at Henry Ward Beecher 's old church , just so as to make things seem real again . Planty had been annoyed in a peculiar fashion  --  that is , by a peculiar accident  --  during the first decade of the Twentieth Century . The subway wasextended from Manhattan to Brooklyn  --  quite regardless of Planty 's outraged feelings  --  and he had been the witness of a strange occurrence . There was an explosion under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up through the river bed , through the river itself , and into the air . Fortunately , he was not much hurt . Between ten and fifteen years later , when a second tube was put beneath the river , an exactly similar accident occurred again  --  only this time two workmen were blown through the river and into the air above it . Planty witnessed this through his window also , and again he was annoyed . It was very disturbing to look out on the Fast River and see workmen whirling in the air all the time . The lapse of years did not register on Planty 's mind . The first accident might have Leen only the day before the second one . He sat down and wrote a letter to the New York Times , and another one to the Brooklyn Daily Eagle , in which he wanted to know what the world was coming to . He felt that there was something threatening to the social order when every time a man looked nut of his window he saw people coming up out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Payer . " He felt that this thing had gone far enough and that an aroused citizenry could be pushed only just so far . He read these letters to his wife and sister-in-law after he had written them . " What does he mean , " asked Elvira , puzzled , " about men coming up out of the river ? " " If a man came up out of the river or dropped down out of the sky and attracted Planty 's attention , " Maisie said , with a malicious and cunning leer at Elvira , " I imagine it could be with but one purpose ! " Elvira , not daring to be silent , murmured her inquiry . " If a man appeared to Planty in any queer way like that , " said Maisie , in a half-whisper , " it could only be to tell ! " She leered toward Planty , who had gone to sleep again by his window . When he woke up again , not being in complete possession of his faculties , he asked his wife , " Elvira @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the river ? " " What man ? " asked Elvira , alarmed . " Any man , " said Planty . He sat firmly in his chair , staring out over the river , with the knob of his walking stick grasped tightly in his hands as if he might do something about it himself if it happened again . " He looks to me , " suggested Maisie , " as if he had taken to seeing ghosts ! And people who see ghosts can read your mind tool So you want to keep all thought of your sin out of your mind , Elvira , or he 'll pick it out of your brain ! " " You do n't give me any chance to forget it ! " cried Elvira in wailing desperation . The world changed , and Planty and his wife and sister-in-law were only dimly aware of it . In 1902 , there was a Roosevelt in the White House , doing things of which Planty did not altogether approve . in 1933 , he was apparently still there  --  or , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal of time in the autumn of 1933 , wondering what on earth was the matter with the Roosevelts . He had heard of them from boyhood as a good old Long Island family ; but from what he gathered they were n't acting that way at all nowadays . In the summer of 1933 , when there was much talk about currency inflation , Planty remarked , " But how can Roosevelt inflate the currency ? He 's in South America or Africa , or somewhere , exploring something ! " " He could come back and inflate it , could n't he ? " said Maisie , shouting into his telephone . Planty thought for several days about this , and then delivered himself of a master-stroke of intuition : " There 's two of ' em , " said Planty . " Two Roosevelts  --  you ca n't fool me ! " Great changes came in the world , in physical science , in economics and industry , in politics and the social order ; but they were not great enough to obliterate from the minds of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wireless-telegraphy to going ; airplanes came along ; moving pictures claimed the attention of the multitudes ; but these matters were in the outer fringes of their consciousness . The important matter , the center of the cosmos , was that Elvira had been wickedly indiscreet in 1876 ? or was it in 1893 ? On the day that it was announced in the papers that the North Pole had been reached , Maisie accused Elvira of having deliberately allowed a hot water bag to leak upon her feet . " If you 're not more careful I 'll tell Plantyl " she hissed . " It was a Brooklyn man who reached the Pole , " said Planty , from the depths of his paper , with a great deal of satisfaction . Later , when it was revealed that Peary was the real discoverer , and not Dr. Cook of Brooklyn , Planty regarded this as a felonious plot on the part of certain New York interests to take something away from Brooklyn . Or could it be that there were two of them , two discoverers ? Things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out of the river , blown into the air ; later , after he had thought of this for years , there was the mystery of the two Roosevelts . He talked of this a good deal to Elvira , and she also became infected with this belief of a kind of double vision . Perhaps , after all , she had been the heroine of an affair in 1876 and another in 1893 , and Maisie was sight . Had it been a Kentuckian or a Virginian ? She could n't remember . The World War broke . From where the old people sat , they could see a part of America 's preparation . For months , transports full of troops , ships full of provisions and munitions passed outward with the tides to the perilous ocean , to fare across it into the unknown , and from their windows they could see the ships . War vessels from the Brooklyn Navy Yard went down the water lane so near them that , with the windows open , they could hear and see the men on the decks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragments of the monstrous epic ; but they were not greatly stirred by it all . In 1876 ? or was it in l893 ? ? Elvira had committed adultery . That was what God was interested in , they thought . Armistice Day was memorable to them as the day on which Elvira got soap into Maisie 's eyes while washing her face . " You want to blind me , " said Maisie . " You want to fix me so that I ca n't see to write it down for Planty to read ! But I can still talk ! " When the depression came and lingered it did not mean much to them . Millions of people were out of work , millions of people were suffering . It never occurred to either Maisie or Elvira that there might be a rough , working sense of proportion in the universe by the measurements of which this vast total of human experience would rather dwarf the significance of Elvira 's scarlet deviation from the conventions . They had been brought up in , and conformed to the standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important . One day in the winter of 1953-34 , just between Christmas and New Year , the worm turned : that is to say , Elvira revolted , and brought down on her head the revelation which had impended for so long . Planty was dozing in his chair . The cat was regarding them from the window-seat with yellow-eyed scorn . Maisie was grumbling in the canopied bed . Elvira was sitting with her hands folded in her Iap , looking out across the cold , sun-lit water at the Statue of Liberty . Elvira never looked Less like revolt . But it seemed to her , suddenly , that a shimmer went over the water , so that the Statue appeared to quiver a little in the bright air . Was she , at last , going to throw that torch , to launch that thunderbolt ? She laughed . For it had come to her mysteriously that she would n't care if both Maisie and the Statue flung their bombs  --  and now ! ? that she had , in fact , been craving it ! At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maisie ceased complaining for a moment and sat up in bed , her eyes round and insolent in her round fleshly face . " Laugh ! " she cried , outraged . " What can you find to laugh at ? Are you laughing at my helplessness ? " " No , " said Elvira , calmly , " not at your helplessness . " " What are you laughing at ? " " At us . At you . At myself . " She laughed again . Furious , Maisie heaved her great , shaking bulk half out of the bed . " You know a noise like that disconcerts me ! If you laugh like that again , I 'll tell PIanty ! " Elvira fixed her gaze calmly and quietly upon her sister 's working face and said mildly : " All right . Tell Planty . " Maisie 's mouth dropped open . She could not believe what she had heard . Her mouth being open , she screamed . " Do you want to kill me ? " she cried . Elvira seemed to consider this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her tones were still mild . " I would n't mind , " she said . Again Maisie did not believe her . She stared , in a queer incredulous silence . Then Elvira said , " That was n't what I was laughing at , though . I was laughing because the thought came to me suddenly that I have always been rather like an old maid ; and it is you , in your mind , who have been the wicked woman  --  the harlot . " Maisie gave a shrill cry of rage , and staggered from the bed . " I 'll tell him , I 'll tell him now ! " she said . She lurched to Planty , and shouted into his telephone . " Elvira is an adulteress ! " she cried . " Huh ? " said Planty , coming out of his doze . " Elviral She committed adultery ! At the Philadelphia Centennial ! In 18761 " Maisie was unused to any exertion whatever . She panted as she spoke , and stood crouched over , her mouth at Planty 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well to-day . " Who ? " said Planty . " Elvira ! " shouted Maisie , trembling and shaking . Elvira looked past them , out of the window , a quiet smile on her lips , an inexpressible sense of relief beginning to pervade her being . She murmured ? but neither one heard her , " Tell him while you are about it , Maisie , that somehow I 'm rather glad I did it now . " " What was it she did ? " asked Planty . " Committed adultery ! " wheezed Maisie . And then Maisie suddenly collapsed , in a queer heap , and lay motionless upon the floor beneath the window . She never moved after that . Planty stared at her stupidly , at first . Then he said , " There seems to be something the matter with Maisie . Like a stroke , Elvira . " " Yes . " Elvira did not move . " She was trying to tell you something and when she could n't make you understand she got so angry that she had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not hear her . " We 'd better do something , " opined Planty . " I 'll send for the doctor pretty soon , " said Elvira . " Though I do n't think it 's much use . " And , as it proved later , it was n't . " She said something  --  about somebody  --  what was it she said ? " inquired Planty . Elvira went over to him , and spoke into his telephone . " What she said was entirely inconsequential , " said Elvira . " And it never was of any great consequence . I wish I had realized that sooner . " A few days later , after the funeral , Planty said to her , " Elvira , it must be terribly lonely to you , now that Maisie 's gone . " " I bear up under it , " said Elvira into his telephone .
