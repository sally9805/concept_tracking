Airline distance , from Camden , N. J. to Middletown , Del. is 54 mi . Frank Hawks in his Northrop Gamma could fly this distance in 15 min . Roscoe Turner in his Wedell-Williams could fly it in less . But last week it was news when a plane called Miss Philadelphia IV flew from Camden to Middletown in 2 hr. 35 min . Miss Philadelphia IV has a wingspan of 6 ft. 1 in. , a fuel capacity of 13 oz. , a tiny one-cylinder Brown engine . Followed by a full-sized plane from take-off to landing she climbed 8,000 ft. , glided 10 mi. in descending circles after her fuel gave out , made a neat three-point landing in a cow-pasture . Built by Maxwell Bassett , 19 , of Philadelphia , winner of the Admiral Moffett and Texaco Trophies for gasoline-powered model planes , Miss Philadelphia IV will have her record certified by the National Aeronautic Association which observed her flight .
