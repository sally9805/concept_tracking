LeT me take you with me to a quiet afternoon meeting early in May , before the more famous and spectacular events are staged , at a race course which is thoroughly and delightfully Parisian ? a race course which sees relatively infrequent American and English tourists or even casual " sportsmen " ? Le Tremblay . Since Le Tremblay is easy to get to from Montparnasse , where I live , and as it is also convenient for my friend and poet-philosopher , Bouboule , who is a taxi-driver by profession , to pick us up near there , I shall invite you to lunch at Les Trianons , opposite the Gare Montparnasse , which is one of the fine restaurants of Paris . We might have a cocktail at Le Select , since it boasts ? as do far too many cafes ? of having a Bar Americain , and lay a preliminary bet at one of the Pari-Mutuel-En-Ville branches in the tobacco shop next to Les Trianonsjust in case we should arrive too late for that race at the track itself . Lunch is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend the sparkling Vouvray there if you have a fish dish ; I recommend it anyway . The moment when are served the vicious black coffee and the liqueurs which bring every good French meal to an end arrives almost too soon . I do n't have to consult my watch ; Bouboule 's ridiculous looking tiny open-face torpedo de sport , as he fondly calls it , has drawn up in front of the little sidewalk terrasse . Even if I were blind , I should know it was there by the frantic and familiar barking of Bouboule 's small and indefatigable fox terrier , who always accompanies him in the front seat . Small as the torpedo is , Bouboule knows how to get the maximum speed out of it , which is high . Much too high , you are inclined to think at first , as you dodge between a beer truck and a trolley car on the wrong side of the street , turn a corner on two wheels , missing a baby carriage by inches , and cross in front of traffic going furiously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time to realize that Bouboule has gone around a " safety island , " joined the opposing traffic , and slipped up an unnoticed side street . We go along the Boulevard Montparnasse , past " This Quarter , " waving to friends sitting outside the Dome , La Coupole , or Le Select ; past , on the left , the Negre de Toulouse and the Closerie des Lilas , with the view down over the Gardens to and across the river even up to a shadowy sort of Sacre Cceur in Montmartre , and , on the right , the Cafe de 1'Observatoir , the Hospital , where I was always puzzled by the sign that accouchements were taken care of on Tuesdays and Thursdays only ( between 2 and 4 o'clock , so please be exact ) , past all these until , with a dizzy side turn , we go up the street Jeanne Dare , Prolongee ( meaning the street , of course ) , and then , biff , over the river , and past wholesale wine shops that seem like all the vol- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate of the city , but do not emerge ; instead , we turn at a left right-angle and follow the fortifications to the next gate ? and along here we go by the " zone " for a bit , where , even to-day , I should not care to walk after dark . Now we do emerge from the city to follow the Bois de Vincennes , along , on our left , one of its loveliest and most emeraldlike sides , with a fine view of rolling country ? for we are high up here ? on the right . By the Vincennes track ( on our left again ) , set back somewhat from the road , and then down into Joinville-le-Pont . Over the Marne , where we are joined by a stream of traffic , including huge , lightninglike autobuses , coming from Paris by the other roads from the center of town , and then , after a mile or so of rather dreary suburbia ( small villas with cast-iron dogs on the roofs ) , Le Tremblay itself ? rich , green , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . Flowers everywhere ; fine greensward everywhere ; a pretty little paddock set in trees ; the grandstand that seems more a huge clubhouse , as it certainly is in two respects ? it serves good drinks and good food . We go in ? but do not worry about Bouboule . He will have his lunch now at a little restaurant near the entrance to the pelouse , and then saunter into that popular endroit , for he has a hot tip on some horse in the fourth , the principal , race ; in fact , many a day he has done better than I have , financially speaking , with his curious outsiders ( from what mysterious source he gets them I do n't know ) . He will be waiting for us at the gate when all is over . Traditionally , the last race is a handicap at French tracks ; but here , as in so many other things , Bouboule is an iconoclast ? he has no love for handicaps , and he never stays for them . He thinks , and rightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load , and the bottomweight ones , too light , though the French handicappers themselves are inordinately proud of their allocation of weights . Inside the gate the first formality is to say Bon jour to the aged servitors who sell programs , and with true French caution I buy only one for you , since a free one is given me in the room reserved for La Presse . Each costs a franc , and rather miraculously , except for a brief formal announcement of the principal events of the forthcoming meets at this same track , contains no advertising whatever . The card has sufficiently wide margins to enable you to write your own brief hieroglyphics of wins , losses , and notes . I might add that , like everybody else , these aged servitors , once you are known to them , will give you a tip on what they euphemistically call a certitude . Tips on the races are plentiful ? and free . With a little diligence , and by consulting all the official and unofficial racing papers , you can get a tip on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal is neglected by these different sources of enlightenment ( though this happens only now and then ) , by all means have a flyer on him ? his chances are good for constituting the , if I may so phrase it , almost inevitable " surpreez , " without which no afternoon of French racing would be complete . We walk up by some gay flowerbeds to the grandstand . It is a large , very pretty , very comfortable grandstand , with a restaurant and its amazingly long bar and , as the day is fair , tables are placed not only in the main hall with the bar , but also outside in the open , cut off from the grass and the flowers by a low boxed hedge . From your table you can plainly see one of the big announcement boards on the building across and down a lawn ( an  | attractive building , too , harmonized with the rest of the architecture ) where the Pari-Mutuel is reckoned , and where the results , the betting , and the final prices , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the names of the horses , together with those of the owners to whom they belong , and for the weights , apprentice allowances , and most other technical points , the card gives full information . II As usual , the first race is a sellingplate affair with a huge entry list ? many will have been scratched at the last moment , so it is just as well to watch closely the affichage , or announcement board , as we sit at a table and order a black coffee and brandy from the waiter , who will likewise give us a tip when he serves us ? and one from the racing heart , too , for he expects no extra pourboire , if , miraculously , his tocard ? outsider ? comes through . Already he has bet his ten francs ; he shows us his ticket proudly , and will be so delighted if his 25 or 30 to 1 " long shot " does the impossible that his emotions will make it difficult to obtain the correct drink ? sometimes , any drink at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather have him win the last race , the puzzling handicap ( also with long enough prices to satisfy anybody ) . That will send him home happy and excited ? and meanwhile we shall get some service . But I wish him luck with enthusiasm just the same . We get up and go to one of the many " Mutuel " windows . There are several in the grandstand itself , in the paddock , opposite the weighing-in enclosure back of the clubhouse ; everywhere in fact , and they range from the modest 10-franc booths , through different 50- and 100-franc booths up to the two booths where each ticket costs 500 francs ( roughly , $20 ) . We leave our chairs tipped and our copies of La Veine and Paris-Midi , which we have been studying so earnestly , on the table , to indicate we are coming back . We do , in fact , keep the same table all afternoon ; it is a convenient gathering place for all of us , and permits each to wander off as fancy decrees , and allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presse room ; also we can have cake and tea there a bit later and , if we win , a bottle of champagne to celebrate or , if we lose , a bottle anyway , to drown our regrets . For luck , and since one horse is as bad as another in this selling curtain-raiser , we make a little bet of 20 francs each on our waiter 's certitude ? 10 francs " a cheval , " that is , 10 francs to win and 10 to " place , " or to arrive 1st , 2nd , or 3rd , for there is no " show " in France as with us for the third horse ; when 8 or more run , the first three are " place " ; when less than 8 , the first two only are " place . " There is no use our climbing the stairs of the grandstand for this unimportant affair , and we do not even go into the paddock , for the horses are already on the track and galloping ? some of them in very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trotting up to the barrier . Nowadays this consists of ropes arranged like bars , in a movable frame , ropes which spring up automatically when the official starter gives the signal that all the horses are lined up properly and ready to go , and release , also automatically and at the same time , the long , jerky-jumping split-second hand of the big clock over the judges ' stand at the finish line . " Parti , " exclaim our French neighbors , straining to see the start , many of them with field glasses , and the bell rings . The clatter of the Pari-Mutuel machines , stamping out last-minute bets , suddenly ceases ; the wire-netting  | screen before each betting booth shoots up with a heart-breaking clatter ; there is a half-minute or so , during which the race is " designed , " as our neighbors put it : then , " Allez , Semblat " ; " Dans une fauteuil , mon coco " ; and , as they near the line , you hear an exasperated feminine voice , " M'sieur , je @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( As a matter of fact the unlucky animal carrying number 13 on his silks is next to last ; she has mixed up the colors with those of number 8 , the winner . ) There is a flash of real excitement , but nothing hysterical ? indeed , if you have just come from one of many race meetings in America , it will strike you right away , and with force , that the so-called emotional French are singularly calm about a horse race , compared with a crowd at stylish Belmont or " blue-grass " Lexington , Kentucky , to say nothing of our English cousins , who may pride themselves on their emotional stability but who , after a close finish at Ascot , or Epsom Downs , make a French racing crowd appear positively as restrained as the people at one of their own afternoon teas . In the excitement of the finish we neglected to notice that " our " horse , termed " Creme de Riz , " and proudly bearing the number 17 among the lightweights has come in third by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but our waiter has n't . He is dancing with nervousness , for fear there will be a reclamation ? i.e. , a complaint for bumping , for not keeping one 's " line , " or position with reference to the rail and other horses ; for interference with another horse in any way , such as the cheerful practice of hitting the head of a horse near you with the butt end of your whip , of course as if accidentally , or , in France , for what is called " brutalizing " a mount , that is , whipping him excessively during the race or at the finish . Although the French are not a sentimental people , they are fond of animals and respect their rights , and jockeys , in addition to being " warned , " are often heavily fined for doing just that . Almost tearfully , the waiter asks us if we noticed anything peculiar at the finish ; we assure him we did not . Fortunately for our nerves , and our waiter 's , who is close to hysteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rings very cheerfully in our ears . How much sweeter a sound that bell has when we have tickets to cash ! The race , with its announced results , is legal now , and not even the President of the French Republic himself can prevent the winners being paid off . For as the " all clear " bell rang , a thin red oblong went up in place above the winning numbers ? the true origin of the expression , " Le rouge est mis . " In about ten minutes the little formality of collecting cash will begin at the paying booths , and a line of happy speculators forms at these paying windows immediately after the " all clear " bell rings ? each one with a satisfied smile of superior wisdom on his face ; and you will be considered very churlish if you do not exchange a joke with your neighbor in the queue , whether male or female , old or young , poorly dressed or stylishly , and explain on what horse , and just why , you will bet in every race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall send our waiter to the booth for us ; it is a congenial task to him anyway , since it permits him to indulge , along with his neighbors in the queue , in that most persistent of French passions , conversation , and especially congenial is his task when , as now , he has a ticket of his own upon which to collect . Before he goes to join the happy line at the pay-out window he hurriedly serves us with a bottle of  | champagne ? a good brand , too ; are we not winners ? ? while we chat in that slightly superior fashion peculiar only to successful plungers , looking up every now and then at the affichage , across the lawn , for the prices . There is a clatter of signs and a chorus of " Tiensl Tiens ! " as under Gagnant first appears the price to be paid for each ten-franc ticket on number 8 , the winner ? 41 francs ( " Three to one , about , " we say to ourselves , " made favorite in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : for 8 , 24 francs ; for 12 ( second by %4 de longeur ) , 32 francs ; and for our dear little number 17 ( close and modest third ) , 84 francs ! We beam with delight : 3 to 1 to win on the winner , but almost 7% to 1 on our horse just to place third , in the money ! And , I hasten to add , in wild selling or debutant races , even far greater differences in prices paid are not exceptional ; at Maisons-Laffitte , sometimes , they are preposterous ? I have myself collected 216 francs for a 10-franc bet on a horse to place that came in second in a race , when the winner , a hot favorite , paid only 21 francs for 10 ? or just over even money ? to win . Our waiter brings back our winnings , together with his own , and since this is aristocratic France rather than democratic America , we pour him out also a glass of champagne , which he downs as we exchange best wishes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the winner , Creme de Riz , was retire ( withdrawn ) faute d'encheres ( because of lack of bidding ) and remains the property of his owner , as listed on the card , and that the owner is just as well pleased at this outcome , since , now that his horse has won , he does not want to part with Creme de Riz after all . How success swells pride of ownership ! And had there been any bidding , admitting he wished to keep his horse , he would have had to outbid the prospective purchaser . ( " Paying himself , " you say ; " how absurd ! " But the State does not think so at all , for the owner has to pay in this case a tax on the un-met sales price he has bid himself ? a tax which he takes naturally out of the prize money for winning . Of course the State does not care where this " transfer " money comes from so long as it gets it ? inexorable , as always . ) We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I shall reproduce in a short English version : 1st Race : Selling Race , for both sexes , over 4 years old , who have not won 50,000 francs ; only the winner to be sold at auction . ( This is the race we have just witnessed. ) 2nd Race : Debut For Fillies. 3rd Race : Reserved For " Gentlemen Riders , Jockeys , and Cavaliers . " ( I reproduce the exact words of the program . At least it is not a race for apprentice jockeys , which sometimes are miracles of bad riding. ) 4th Race : Principal Event , Over 3,000 Meters ? about 2 miles ? For Three And Four-year Olds Of Both Sexes . Prize : 40,000 francs , plus the entry money , which makes it almost double that , or 76,000 francs , or a bit over $3,000 ? worth winning in any country . 5th Race : Debut For Colts. 6th Race : Handicap . III Our first bottle of champagne is finished ; I suggest we make a trip to the paddock to see the " baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them daughters of famous sires . Some are awkward and nervous , some sleek and serene ; almost all are handsome . Their names will intrigue you first : Flower of Love , Miss Vixen ( this name in English , as are several of the others that boast English origin ) , The Last Leaf , Intellectual , Dark Tempest ( there is almost sure to be some product of the prolific Dark Legend , like Dark Way ?  | a real horse , a colt , and a fine one , too , he was ? by Dark Legend out of Shining Way ) , Chocolate Cream ( Cremes are very popular ; Dreams are popular , too ; Reve d'Amour is as common a name as Mary with girls ) , Queens of This , That , or The Other , Capricieuse , of course ( though she looks sober and far from flighty ) , and , finally , just fantastic names , such as ? and I am giving real names ? False Alarm , Baby Rose , To The Death , Laughing With Tears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faithless ( curious name , for a hoped-for winner ) , Charm , Mademoiselle Gaugin , Surprise . Sometimes the names attempt to suggest , by some combination ( as so beautifully in Dark Way ) , both the sire and dam , but not too often . Sheer fantasy seems the general rule . We reach the paddock , as August is crying out " Cote Jaune-Deuxieme ; Deuxieme-Cote Jaune , " and handing around yellow slips , with estimated odds on every contestant in the race at that moment , to his customers . There is a rival , Cote Rose , written on pink slips , of course , and supposedly good on certain kinds of outsiders , as I have sometimes known it really to be . But I never used it , and seldom even looked at it , unless I was with a French friend who took it as a matter of habit . I stuck to August . Ten francs a day for three such slips before each race is the price you owe him . He hands out his first slips as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are posted up and before a sou has been bet at the track itself ( this first advance slip is , of course , guesswork on what the odds will be ? that is , on how the money will really " go " on different horses ? but remarkably shrewd and accurate , all things considered , for August and his pals ? whom he hires to work for him ? know the values of horses and the follies of gambling from years of experience ) ; the next slip from ten to twelve minutes later , after a little actual betting at the booths has given some indication of where the money is going , and , finally , the third , La Derniere , just as the horses go on the track . If a big bet then goes on some outsider , literally at the last second , August or his pals note the fact , and often during the first few seconds of a race , barely as the horses are away from the post , you will see August marching up and down in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Le numbeo septmoitie moins , " meaning that , whatever the price on your slip for 7 ( say 6 to 1 ) may be , a last-minute rush of money has brought it down to 3% to 1 . How often has August rudely shattered dreams of great wealth just as a race got under way , and you wonder with bitterness , " Why ? why at the very last second does everybody suddenly go mad and back my horse ? " This time again we do not climb the stairs to see the race , for it is only a short , straightaway dash of 800 meters , and much ? too much , in fact , for the nerves of several people around us ? depends on the start , always so important for young horses . On this occasion we have indulged in a little flip on number 6 , Fleur d'Avril , who was so glossily black , so spirited , and so eager-looking in the paddock ; and as the bell rings , the " Mutuel " screens clatter up , and the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a clean , fast start , second to the rail . A flash of color ? bright cerise is her jockey 's coat ? and she skims past the judges ' stand an undisputed winner , two good lengths ahead of the nearest of her sporty sisters . There is a thrill ? we picked that horse ; for obviously there were no records to go on since there were no records at all . We are as proud as the owner himself ; in fact , we talk as if the horse belonged to us , as indeed ,  | spiritually and for the moment so to speak , she does . We rest on at the table beside ours complains rather too loudly that " they " are neither gentlemen nor riders ? and cast up the possibilities for the big event of the day , the 4th race , over 3,000 yards , and with some mighty fine animals scheduled to perform . Baron Rothschild 's pair , coupled in the betting to win ( if you bet on one , and the other horse wins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " place , " then the specific horse of the two you select must be there first , second , or third ) , naturally constitutes the favorite with the newspapers , the public , the betting , as is soon evident , and with that mysterious thing called " form " ? all agreeing that the " Ecurie " ( i.e. , the Rothschild " Stable , " or as we say , " Entry " ) ought to win . It ? or one of " them , " if you persist in thinking of the horses themselves ? is the " logic " ( what the French term etude raisonnee ) of the situation . Like so many others , however , we are interested neither in logic nor favorites ; we are looking for a miracle . And presently we find one ? or , more accurately ? we hope we have . It is a horse which I have myself given in the paper as my outsider for this event ( in Paris , newspaper prognosticators for the races give , ordinarily , two selections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , a first choice to win and a second to place ? and , in addition , a possible outsider for each event ; finally , they give the day 's " best " one or two bets ) . We select this animal for a number of reasons : my first choice to win was withdrawn over night , in view of a race the following week at Saint-Cloud , a race which his owner somewhat tardily decided suits this particular thoroughbred 's peculiar style better than to-day 's contest ; then for my second choice , who is going to compete , although I stick to my guns in one sense and still think he is going to be " up there , " somewhere among the first three or four when all is over , I frankly prefer my " outsider " ? like him better now , I mean , after our trip to the paddock , where he looked fit . Besides these two reasons for changing my mind , I like my outsider 's owner : I mean of course in a racing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which this owner ( a Belgian , incidentally ) has his horses " conditioned " and trained . And I like too the jockey , who is intelligent and vigorous , and has , so to speak , a reputation for honesty . At all events , we hope with fervor , for we send our waiter , trembling at our audacity , to the booth to buy each of us a 100-franc ticket to win on Insolent ( for that , I forgot to tell you , is our outsider 's name , despite which he comes from very respectable racing blood on both sides of his family ) . As we trudge up the stairs of the grandstand to get , this time of all times , a good view of the race , I regale you with racing stories , all tending to show that we are not so foolish as we might otherwise appear to be . Is it not a solemn and awful fact that , in spite of every kind of contrary and supposedly reasonable tip , a horse belonging to James Hennessy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid over 66 to 1 to win the Grand Prix De Paris ? and with no less a jockey on his back than smiling " Parson " Jack Jennings ( called Parson because he preached at the little Anglican Church of Maisons-Laffitte on a Sunday before a race meeting in that very town ? a meeting when he was riding too ) . Remember Les Rameaux ( palms ) , and how he won with that name on Good Friday to pay a record price in our generation . Do n't forget Reine Lumiere . Do n't forget  | so many others that have knocked all the experts for a dizzy loop of chagrined surprise . Cheer up ! Insolent has a chance , no matter how enthusiastically he is now neglected by the public . You say he is a " wild outsider . " Just so ? and what of it ? What constitutes an outsider anyway ? It is not the horse ; it is an insensitiveness , a hate fixation , a wilful blindness on the part of the public , at least that part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion with what , we devoutly hope , is its own money . So we climb the stairs and get a spot on the balcony where we can see the entire field and even the start , which is now taking place just beyond the last betting booth in the pelouse . The tapes of the starting-gate shoot up and the bell rings ? they are off , well bunched , and with no stragglers left hopelessly behind . For the first one thousand meters they are too far away to be distinguished one from another , even if there is always near you some excited bettor proclaiming in a loud , aggressive tone that " his " horse is well ahead and is going to win , as the French express it , in an " armchair . " But as they swing into the second thousand of their three thousandmeter contest , some horses begin to " bunch up " in front , and one or two of the others , now starting to fall back , are already hopelessly beaten . With delight we observe that Insolent is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race , very much in it , in fact . For now the horses are turning into the " run-in " of the straight , past the stand , directly in front of us , to the finish . Who is that " on the rail " ? Sure enough , it is the wretched favorite . But there is Insolent , running on the side nearer to us ? called the " outside , " of course , as strictly it is , with reference to the rail ? and running as fast as a commuter trying to catch the 8.15 . His jockey is bent over , urging him on as he " strokes " him with the whip but careful , even in the excitement of this finish , not really to hit him directly at all . He is gaining every gallop ; it is between him and the favorite alone now ? the others are beaten , all of them , and for these last heart-breaking 25 yards it is a two-horse race . The crowd is on its toes in an uproar , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shamelessly shout , " Step on it , baby ! step on it ! " They shoot past the judges ' stand , and as the hubbub continues I turn to you , and simultaneously we ask each other the same question , " Did he make it ? " There is a sudden sharp lull in the racket ; up goes the number 4 ? big as life and twice as natural , as one of my confreres on the paper always puts it . Insolent has won ! We have won ! IV Curious , that queer and unreasonable , yet compulsive elation of winning ? the feeling that your judgment , your luck , and your nerve have all combined properly , and that all is well with the world . And we hum snatches of a popular tune , like " Avec Le Sourire , " as we climb down the stairs . For me there are a few nervous moments ( I do n't communicate to you my fears about a reclamation , or complaint ; this time , fortunately , they are false fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our table , and our waiter , with almost reverential gesture , pours out some champagne . But these moments are happily short . The " all clear " bell rings : everything is " regular " ; everything is all right . The nervous tension one feels at all French race courses during these three or four minutes before le rouge est mis vanishes ; we chatter like magpies . And now , of course , I can do it ? tell you about  | some real reclamations , i.e. , when the complaints were found to be justified by the commissioners , or when they interfered of their own volition to alter the result . I tell you how famous winners were put out of the money ? distance , the French politely term it ? by the authorities , and how , when this happened once at Auteuil , I heard a large , fat man , with a tortured expression on his face , groan like a wounded cow ; how , when another time it happened right here at Le Tremblay , I heard the much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lines of betting-booths , and all within earshot rushed back to find an unfortunate and inanimate sportsman who had made his final wager with eternity . These grim anecdotes naturally give the proper contrast to our own good fortune . We drink deep , almost as if we were at a wake . I conclude , however , on a more cheerful note , pointing out that , regrettable as these incidents were , generally speaking , race-track followers in France are a sanguine lot ? especially sanguine compared with plungers at the gambling casinos . Backers of horses usually , at least , get " a run for their money " in a literal rather than metaphorical sense ? and , besides , although a horse may lose one race , he is not irrevocably a lost hope by any manner of means . He may run again , when the race , or something else , suits him better ; and the fact that he was nowhere to-day will only make his price to win next week all the higher . For if there is one spot on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French race course . And one spot where ? every now and then ? that hope is justified . After ten minutes of this cheerful atmosphere the clatter of signs tells us that the price is going up ; we stare in a numbed sort of way . Yes , it 's true ? 246 francs 50 centimes for every 10 francs bet to win on Insolent . Our tickets become slips of precious gold , for , at the current rate of exchange , every franc we have bet has magically turned into a dollar , and our 100-franc bets mean a $100-return to each of us . Let our waiter bring us another bottle ! What do we care for money now ? We can take a flyer on the next race ? and on the handicap too , even though Bouboule 's darling " Old Pip " is not competing in it ? and it wo n't cost us anything anyway . ( In racing , every " win " means always extra money ; every " lose " means simply a temporarily bad investment , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Le Tremblay looks all of a sudden in the afternoon sunset glow ! This mood is not at all disturbed by the fact that we pick a colt for the next race ? the debut for the male youngsters ? that comes in almost last . After all , we just bet on him " for the fun of it , " and , with true caution , I have seen to it that we have gone light . Further than that we stay on merely to watch the final race , and see a bottom weight put the handicappers to shame by coming in yards and yards ahead of his nearest competitor . However , the winner has been heavily backed by the public and pays only 4 to 1 ? somebody was " wise " at the last moment . Our waiter even murmurs a few suspicious remarks about a combine as we pay the check and go into the bar for a chapeau de nuit with August . Bouboule is ready for us at the gate ; he has , he announces at once , done just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he is frankly pleased to learn that we have had , as bettors always phrase it , a " good " afternoon . He will drive us back with more of a regard for the speed limits , which ordinarily mean so little to him . There will even be time for us all to stop at Chez Harry 's for a drink before I have to go to the office to write my piece  | on what has happened ? and on what , I believe , is going to happen at Enghien to-morrow . Fortunately , to-morrow 's meeting is not especially important ; I can finish my work quickly , and we can all have dinner at the " Old Man 's , " as I call it , a restaurant so dear to my heart that I am not even going to tell you where it is ? and I remember now , I saw the " Old Man " himself for a moment in the paddock at the races this afternoon , and I wonder vaguely how he made out on the day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 'll tell us all he knows about the morrow 's Enghien meeting and perhaps , if he is in good humor , he 'll sing us one of those Auvergne songs he remembers from his lusty youth . You talk a bit about our luck and this , that , or the other , but for me reaction has set in , and I am , of a sudden , terribly sleepy and I doze away . I come to myself with an apologetic grin and look to see where we are ? back in Paris , going along the Quai of the Ile Saint-Louis , and Bouboule will now follow the left ? after crossing in front of Notre Dame on the Ile de la Cite ? bank to the bridge just beyond the Gare d'Orsay , before he goes over to the crowded part of town and Chez Harry 's . I feel a bit embarrassed at falling asleep . " And will you , " I inquire politely , " when you get back home , remember your afternoon at the races in Paris ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
