txt Prime Minister BALDwix has been making no new speeches . In his last public deliverance about the threat of war in North Africa he said that his Government would definitely base its policy upon the Covenant of the League of Nations . Yesterday his Cabinet reaffirmed the Government 's willingness to embark on collective action in support of the Covenant , Article XVI of which provides for the severance of all financial and commercial relations with any member of the League that resorted to war in disregard of its obligations under the League . This resolve , however , may not be conclusive . Great Britain will not act without that " mutual support " by all the members of the League contemplated by Article XVI . Should that fail her , she might refrain from entering upon any action that would not be joint . Furthermore , the British Cabinet distinctly intends to pursue , in conjunction with Prance , peaceful negotiations with Italy for the purpose of preventing war without having recourse to the stringent application of economic sanctions to Italy . Thus the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , MussoLiNi is beginning to make it evident that he can not safely display scornful indifference to the British attitude . On that question he has just allowed - two Italian newspapers to fly trial balloons . The first one was full of friendly sentiments . The last thing that he wanted was a conflict with Great Britain . Above all things he desired a conciliatory approach on both sides to the questions dividing them . But the next balloon was of a different color . It carried aloft the message to Great Britain that " sanctions mean war . " Then there were wild and whirling words to the effect that the British course , if persisted in , would transfer the seat of war from . Africa to Europe . Having faced and flouted the other nations in the efforts of diplomacy , Italy is prepared to meet them all on the field of battle . This is preposterous , except it be considered as a gigantic bluff . If it was that , it has already failed to swerve Great Britain from her announced policy . To this particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the end it may be forced to become one . Our foreign policy , as stated by Secretary HULL to the Italian Ambassador is based upon the Briand-Kellogg treaty . When that treaty was under debate in our Senate , prior to ratification , in 1928 , Senator BORAH said that one important result of it would be to " enlist the support of the United " States in cooperative action against " any nation which is guilty of a fla " grant violation of this agreement . " Of course , ' our Government should be the judge of the facts , and also should reserve the right to decide what measures it would adopt . But , added Senator BORAH , " It is quite inconceivable that " this country would stand , idly by in " case of a grave breach of a multi2Iflteral treaty to which it is a party . " It is on the basis of such utterances by American authorities , including President ROOSEVELT himself , that the League of Nations may look to the United States to aid it in the endeavor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no man can predict the full consequences .
