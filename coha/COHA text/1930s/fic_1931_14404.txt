SCENE : The scene is a sitting-room in RODERICK DEAN 'S roof apartment overlooking the East River . The room is on the second floor of a " Triplex " apartment . It leads onto a glass-enclosed veranda overlooking the River . It is five o'clock of a November afternoon . AT RISE : We discover RODERICK DEAN and his friend HAROLD SIGRIFT , familiarly known as SIG . SIGRIFT is very fat ; about thirty years old , and lies down whenever possible . He somewhat resembles ALEXANDER WOOLLCOTT , who conceivably might play him . When the curtain goes up SIGRIFT is stretched out on the sofa drinking highballs . RODERICK , slim and volatile , is at the piano , tinkling away . He keeps leaving the piano and coming back to it . HAROLD SIGRIFT What will your father say ! RODERICK DEAN He 'll adore her ! In fact , one reason I want to marry her is to put her out of father 's range . HAROLD SIGRIFT But why marry her ? RODERICK DEAN I adore her ! HAROLD SIGRIFT You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RODERICK DEAN I think my adoration would bore her . I could n't hold her with it . I 've got to hold her . It 's important for me , Sig. p. 3 HAROLD SIGRIFT This is terrible . I do n't know what to do . The trouble is you 're so excessively nave  --  I do n't know how to approach you . RODERICK DEAN That 's funny . HAROLD SIGRIFT What ? RODERICK DEAN I was talking about you yesterday . I said I liked you because you were nave . Who 's sophisticated , that 's what I 'd like to know ? Is my father sophisticated ? I 've seen him flattered by the simplest people , tenors , business men , polo-players . He swells . Yet he wears opera hats and goes to first nights . I think as a matter of fact that my passion for Abby Fane is really exquisitely sophisticated . HAROLD SIGRIFT Abby Fane  --  is that her real name , I wonder ? RODERICK DEAN You 're gross , Sig , and that 's why you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you 're a god-damned fool . RODERICK DEAN She 's luminous . HAROLD SIGRIFT An arc-light . RODERICK DEAN That 's just it  --  electricity . HAROLD SIGRIFT A blues singer in a night club ! RODERICK DEAN What 's the matter with that ? Who do you want me to marry  --  Shumann-Heink ? p. 4 HAROLD SIGRIFT And what a night club ! RODERICK DEAN You 're a snob , that 's all . The girl 's magnificent . SIGRIFT shakes his head helplessly . Her vitality is magnificent . After all , who the hell am I ? A millionaire 's son . Well what of it ! The town 's lousy with them . I 've been a failure at everything . HAROLD SIGRIFT At 25 ! RODERICK DEAN My God , if you 're not a success when you 're twenty-five , when will you be ? I play a saxophone  --  do I do it as well as Bunny Weifel , who 's 22 ? I ran a jazz band  --  did I make a hit of it ? I am a composer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ license , but who has n't ? Among artists , I 'm tolerated because I 'm rich . And do n't you think I do n't know it . HAROLD SIGRIFT Will the prima donna of the Hosty Totsy change all that ? RODERICK DEAN I do n't say she will . All I say is , it 's no concession for me to marry her . The very assumption is arrogant . She may turn me down flat . SIGRIFT shakes his head again . He just whistles . Well , she may ! HAROLD SIGRIFT If she turns you down , my Blossom , then I 'm Skippey ! RODERICK DEAN She 's lovely . She 's got freshness , high spirits , vitality . She 's unspoiled  --  p. 5 HAROLD SIGRIFT My God , you do n't think that ! RODERICK DEAN No , I do n't give a damn . I mean she 's unspoiled by civilization . HAROLD SIGRIFT She 's untouched by civilization . RODERICK DEAN She transforms that dirty little night club . Those banal words she sings  --  they become something  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has glamor . She has poetry . HAROLD SIGRIFT I hate to blight this romance , but I 'm afraid I 've got to . RODERICK DEAN Blight your head off . He goes to the piano and plays a blues song by GEORGE GERSHWIN , humming it while he sings . HAROLD SIGRIFT Let me tell you something about vitality , my good man . It 's tiresome to live with . I lived with a girl once who had vitality . She wore me out . Nowadays I go in for languor . RODERICK DEAN That 's why you 're so trim and athletic looking . HAROLD SIGRIFT What is this mania for flat stomachs , anyway ? I think they 're monotonous . RODERICK DEAN You 're a Roman emperor , Sig  --  misplaced . p. 6 HAROLD SIGRIFT I 'm comfortable . I 'm sensible . I have no inhibitions . RODERICK DEAN That 's it ! I 'm not comfortable . Damn it ! HAROLD SIGRIFT Why do n't you write a tune  --  " I 've Got Those Maladjusted Blues "  --  and get your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RODERICK DEAN Wish I could write a good jazz tune . Ca n't , I 'm too delicate . HAROLD SIGRIFT You should have lived in the eighteenth century  --  turned out madrigals . Big madrigal man from Fontainbleau . RODERICK changes what he is playing to an unpublished song by GEORGE GERSHWIN . That 's nice ! RODERICK DEAN Not bad . HAROLD SIGRIFT You 're coming along . RODERICK DEAN It happens to be by Gershwin . HAROLD SIGRIFT Well then he 's coming along . Speaking of vitality  --  do you know Manny Walsh ? RODERICK DEAN He owns the Hotsy Totsy , does n't he ? HAROLD SIGRIFT He owns a dozen night clubs . But that 's just his amusement . He plays with them  --  as your father does with the Opera , but he 's probably the most powerful racketeer in town . Just in to-day 's paper I noticed they returned 47 indictments against him . p. 7 RODERICK DEAN That 's a lot . HAROLD SIGRIFT They roll off him  --  he loves indictments . Also Rod , I believe he loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were driving at something . I always suspect you , when your approach is casual like that . HAROLD SIGRIFT It is also rumored that the distinguished polo player , Cass Worthing  --  RODERICK DEAN Rather sharp . Do n't be trivial , Sig . He gets up from the piano . HAROLD SIGRIFT And you , Rod , do n't you be quixotic . KAY , RODERICK 'S sister , comes in . She is a charming , unaffected girl , about a year younger than RODERICK . RODERICK DEAN Hello . KATHRYN DEAN Where is she ? Hello Sig . Hello dear . Where is she ? RODERICK DEAN Under the piano . KATHRYN DEAN Do n't kid . RODERICK DEAN Come out Abby . KATHRYN DEAN Ca n't wait to meet her . She 's simply marvelous . I 'm crazy about her . p. 8 HAROLD SIGRIFT You know her ! KATHRYN DEAN No , but I saw her last night . RODERICK DEAN What made you  --  KATHRYN DEAN I heard you were interested . RODERICK DEAN How ? KATHRYN DEAN Sig told me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you seemed secretive about her , so I went myself to the Hotsy Totsy last night . She 's wonderful . RODERICK DEAN In triumph . You see ? HAROLD SIGRIFT What ! No opposition ! This ruins everything . KATHRYN DEAN Where has she been all this time ? Imagine her singing in a cheap little night club like that . Why does n't some one snap her up . RODERICK DEAN They have . She 's signing for the " Scandals . " KATHRYN DEAN Mark my words , she 'll wow everybody . HAROLD SIGRIFT She 's wowed Rod already . KATHRYN DEAN Damn good taste , Rod . p. 9 HAROLD SIGRIFT To RODERICK . What are you going to do about this family approbation ? RODERICK DEAN Nothing can deter me . HAROLD SIGRIFT Do you understand that your deluded brother wants to marry her ? KATHRYN DEAN Why not ? HAROLD SIGRIFT I can see I 'll have to cable your father . KATHRYN DEAN Shoot ! Father ! He 'd probably back a show for her . HAROLD SIGRIFT Thank God my people have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy . KATHRYN DEAN Healthy ! Call that healthy ! It 's revolting ! She pats his stomach . HAROLD SIGRIFT Yes , I call that healthy . Indicates RODERICK . Look at him . Nerves . Reading . Artistic ambition . KATHRYN DEAN By the way Rod , I saw Max yesterday . He wants us to write two songs for his show  --  RODERICK DEAN No . No more Kay . No more song writing . KATHRYN DEAN Oh , Rod ! Why ? HAROLD SIGRIFT I 'm glad you 're giving it up , Rod . Rich people should patronize art  --  when it amuses them  --  not practice it . p. 10 KATHRYN DEAN Oh , why should the poor have all the fun ? RODERICK DEAN Because they have all the talent . HAROLD SIGRIFT Like hell they have . Look at the Cavalier poets . RODERICK DEAN Look at Shakespeare . HAROLD SIGRIFT You look at him . Shakespeare bores me . RODERICK DEAN Sig 's bored . What shall we do ? HAROLD SIGRIFT Where 's that blues singer ? I feel like insulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word Sig  --  so much as a hint  --  HAROLD SIGRIFT You ca n't bully me . I have immense physical courage . KATHRYN DEAN Over him . What shall I do to him , Rod ? I discovered once that he 's ticklish . HAROLD SIGRIFT Frightened to death . Do n't Kay . She does . Do n't !  --  Roderick ! RODERICK DEAN Do n't like those squeals Kay . KATHRYN DEAN Letting up on him . All right , but remember p. 11 RODERICK DEAN If you say so much as a  --  as an innuendo to Abby . HAROLD SIGRIFT She 'll never understand an innuendo . KATHRYN DEAN Well , I will , and I promise you no matter who 's here  --  I 'll tickle you . She desists . SIGRIFT regains his dignity . HAROLD SIGRIFT Especially ca n't I understand this mania of otherwise sensitive and delicate people for jazz . It 's a sign of anemia . KATHRYN DEAN It 's primitive . HAROLD SIGRIFT Well who the hell wants to be primitive ? Civilization is departure from the primitive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's as easy as golf . Any one can do something at it . It 's cartoon music . RODERICK DEAN Sig has spoken . HAROLD SIGRIFT The other night while Rod 's girl friend was singing , I made an effort to detach from her somewhat alluring personality the burden of her song . I remember the words . Here is the ditty , which , Kay , you found touching : " He ca n't play golf or tennis or poloOr sing a solo or rowAnd yet I do n't know why I love him , Because he 's just my Bill . " p. 12 RODERICK DEAN What of it ? The words do n't matter . I do n't care how banal they are  --  when she sings them  --  they 're washed in glamor . The words are stupid when you say them , but they 're not stupid when she sings them . KATHRYN DEAN You 're right Rod . When she sings them they become touching and true . HAROLD SIGRIFT The worst of it is she sings them with sincerity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine being sincere about a ditty like that ? Can you  --  The BUTLER comes in . BUTLER Mr. Walsh to see you Mr. Dean . RODERICK DEAN Mr. who ? BUTLER Mr. Walsh . HAROLD SIGRIFT Manny Walsh ? BUTLER I do n't know sir . HAROLD SIGRIFT Describe him . BUTLER Tall gentleman , sir , with a gray fedora hat and a yellow tie , with spots . HAROLD SIGRIFT That 's Manny ! Roderick , you are honored . KATHRYN DEAN Exciting ! The papers are full of him . RODERICK DEAN Ask him up . The BUTLER goes out . SIGRIFT begins to bellow a Wagnerian aria. p. 13 KATHRYN DEAN What 's the matter with him ? HAROLD SIGRIFT I 'm just so happy ! RODERICK DEAN I 've met Walsh at the Hotsy Totsy . He 's an interesting fellow . HAROLD SIGRIFT I 'm just trying to think who I want bumped off . Who Kay ? Rod ? RODERICK DEAN You 'll be crazy about him Kay . He 's a figure out of the Renaissance , really . Just imagine him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will  --  HAROLD SIGRIFT You 're a hell of an influence on your sister . RODERICK DEAN I 'd trust her with Walsh rather than with you any day . Abby tells me he looks after the girls in the night club like a father . Takes care of them when they are sick and writes to their mothers  --  The BUTLER comes back , ushering in MANNY WALSH . He is a bit taken aback at finding other people there . RODERICK DEAN Going to him . How do you do ? We 've met before . MANNY WALSH Yeh ! RODERICK DEAN This is my sister Katherine . p. 14 KATHRYN DEAN How do you do ? MANNY WALSH How are yer ? HAROLD SIGRIFT Hello Manny . MANNY WALSH Hello Sig . KATHRYN DEAN You 're right Rod . He would ! To MANNY . I 'm imagining you in Renaissance clothes . MANNY WALSH What for ? KATHRYN DEAN Never mind  --  will you have a cocktail ? MANNY WALSH No , thanks , I never drink cocktails . RODERICK DEAN Highball ? MANNY WALSH Never drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep physically fit ? MANNY WALSH Literally . That and exercise . To RODERICK . Mr. Dean I 'd like to speak to you alone . Do you mind ? I 'll just take a few minutes of your valuable time . He looks at the cocktail shaker and tea things . He is faintly ironic . RODERICK DEAN Certainly . KATHRYN DEAN Come on Sig. p. 15 HAROLD SIGRIFT Indignant . Do I have to move ? Surely Manny you can talk in front of baby . You can spell out the big words . MANNY WALSH Sorry ! It 's personal . RODERICK DEAN To his sister . Get him up Kay . KATHRYN DEAN I 'll tickle you ! HAROLD SIGRIFT Lumbering up . All right . RODERICK DEAN To MANNY . To get Sig out of a chair is a problem in levitation . HAROLD SIGRIFT As he lumbers out of the room . Why was I doomed to live in so vertiginous an age ? KATHRYN DEAN Old featherbed ! HAROLD SIGRIFT Manny was n't it Pascal who said : " Most of the troubles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KATHRYN DEAN You 'll die of fatty degeneration  --  HAROLD SIGRIFT Better than dying of exhaustion . They go out . RODERICK is deferential but puzzled . RODERICK DEAN Cigarette ? p. 16 MANNY WALSH No , thanks . RODERICK DEAN Cigar ? MANNY WALSH Thanks . He takes one and RODERICK lights it for him . I came about Abby . RODERICK DEAN Yes ? MANNY WALSH That little girl means a lot to me . RODERICK DEAN It 's a sympathy we share . There is a pause . MANNY is finding it harder than he anticipated . MANNY WALSH Think I 'll break a rule . Will you give me a highball ? RODERICK DEAN Delighted to have something to do . Certainly . He mixes it . MANNY WALSH Abby 'll give me holy hell if she finds out I 've been here . RODERICK DEAN Then perhaps I 'd better tell you I 'm expecting her . MANNY WALSH Here ? When ? RODERICK DEAN Any time now . MANNY WALSH Under his breath . Jesus ! He gulps highball . It 's damned funny Dean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  right now I 'm in the thick of a muddle  --  you 've seen the papers p. 17 RODERICK DEAN Yes . People resent your monopoly . But you must n't mind that . The law resists the logic of events . MANNY WALSH Sure . Things got into my hands  --  they 're the best hands . RODERICK DEAN I 'm sure they are . MANNY WALSH Say , you 're different from what I thought  --  you 're okay . RODERICK DEAN Thank you . MANNY WALSH When I saw you first at the Hotsy Totsy I did n't like you . I thought you were a nance . RODERICK DEAN Would that have prejudiced you ? MANNY WALSH Well sure it would ! RODERICK DEAN It 's funny I ca n't dislike people because they have idiosyncrasies I do n't share . It rather piques me . MANNY WALSH A novelty in point of view . Yeh ? RODERICK DEAN Yeh ! MANNY WALSH Looks at his watch nervously . How soon is she coming ? RODERICK DEAN Do n't know . She 's likely to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not exactly afraid  --  p. 18 RODERICK DEAN If you 're afraid what should I be ? You are manifestly better equipped to handle women . MANNY WALSH Reflectively . Abby 's the first dame that ever got the best of me . RODERICK DEAN How ? MANNY WALSH That 's it . Do n't know . Nothing she does . She 's sweet . It 's only that  --  RODERICK DEAN What ? MANNY WALSH I feel she knows everything I 'm thinking , but that I do n't know everything she 's thinking . RODERICK DEAN Why do n't you keep something in reserve ? MANNY WALSH Ca n't . Not my nature . RODERICK DEAN Is Abby mysterious ? I think her rather transparent , am I wrong ? MANNY WALSH No , you 're right , but she buffaloes me . It 's foolish , because I know her from way back . She comes from where I come from . And I 've gone much farther than she has . You would n't believe me if I told you what my income is . The newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's more than that . RODERICK DEAN Under-statement in a newspaper  --  what a relief ! MANNY WALSH I 've worked myself up , and in my racket that 's no so simple . Besides brains you 've got to have physical courage . p. 19 RODERICK DEAN I 'm sure of it . MANNY WALSH I 'm at the top and it 'll take a better man to put me down . RODERICK DEAN I wish you 'd tell me the inside sometimes  --  not for publication . MANNY WALSH Sure I 'll tell you . You could n't publish more than they 've published already . RODERICK DEAN Are n't you at all frightened at these revelations ? MANNY WALSH No . All this agitation do n't mean anything . Nobody gives a damn . RODERICK DEAN I admire you immensely , Manny . You 're a realist . MANNY WALSH Just catching the drift . What the hell 's the use in being anything else ? RODERICK DEAN No use . It 's a habit you fall into in early youth  --  when you 're not forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grappled with it . I do every day . All day . RODERICK DEAN Have another highball . MANNY WALSH Cautiously . Well , its ' an unusual occasion RODERICK DEAN It is for me. p. 20 MANNY WALSH To get back to Abby  --  you know you 're a fellow one can talk over general affairs with . You 're not narrow . RODERICK DEAN Is that good ? It 's an age of specialists . MANNY WALSH Anyhow , you seem to know what it 's all about . RODERICK DEAN That 's an appearance . MANNY WALSH I can see why Abby likes you . RODERICK DEAN Does she like me ? MANNY WALSH Say  --  ! RODERICK DEAN I 've conveyed to her that I like her MANNY WALSH I gave her hell this morning for falling for society . I told her that was no victory . You 'd be surprised the swell gals I 've had to keep off my tracks . Park Avenue is as easy as a judge 's conscience . They seem to go for a man like me that 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set ai n't got much  --  RODERICK DEAN As you see  --  MANNY WALSH No , no  --  not you . You 're okay . But this is what I came to tell you . I do n't know what you 've heard about me and Abby . RODERICK DEAN I have n't heard anything . p. 21 MANNY WALSH I understand . You 're a gentleman . But I just want to tell you this  --  this is what I came to tell you  --  the reason Abby and me ai n't married is because she wo n't marry me . RODERICK DEAN No ? MANNY WALSH I 've asked her a thousand times . I asked her this morning . RODERICK DEAN Does she offer you any hope at all ? MANNY WALSH No . RODERICK DEAN Sorry . MANNY WALSH Thanks . RODERICK DEAN Any reason ? MANNY WALSH The god-damnedest reason . RODERICK DEAN Really ? MANNY WALSH Gloomily . She says I 'm too serious . RODERICK DEAN Really ? MANNY WALSH Can you beat it ? RODERICK DEAN I 'm afraid she 's frivolous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you think how I 've worked and slaved and where I 've got to out of nothing . RODERICK DEAN It 's most impressive . p. 22 MANNY WALSH And the funny thing is everything I 've done , I 've done for Abby . She 's been  --  well , my inspiration . You could call it that . I think most everything a man does he has some little girl in the back of his mind . Do n't you ? RODERICK DEAN In some cases it 's more pervasive even than that . MANNY WALSH Not understanding but riding along . Sure ! Now I 'm on top I ca n't get the thing I want . RODERICK DEAN That 's life , is n't it ? Always ironic MANNY WALSH Do n't misunderstand me . I 'm going right on Abby or no Abby . RODERICK DEAN I 'm sure you will . MANNY WALSH I 'm a strong man and no woman is going to  --  Enter KAY . KATHRYN DEAN Is the heavy conference over ? RODERICK DEAN Is it ? MANNY WALSH Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks . Sig asked me to read aloud to him so he could fall asleep without hurting my feelings . MANNY WALSH Any guy who 'd fall asleep on you , Miss Deane , must be a sap . Enter BUTLER. p. 23 BUTLER Miss Fane is here . RODERICK DEAN Oh ! Ask her up , will you ? KATHRYN DEAN Look at Rod trying to appear casual . RODERICK DEAN Oh , shut up ! KATHRYN DEAN Do n't worry , darling , we 'll be going soon . MANNY WALSH Just my luck ! RODERICK DEAN Do n't you be afraid , I 'll protect you . MANNY WALSH That 'll be great . KATHRYN DEAN What 's the matter with you Mr. Walsh ? MANNY WALSH Nothing . KATHRYN DEAN Have you a weakness , Manny ? Has Achilles a heel ? MANNY WALSH What ? Enter BUTLER . BUTLER Miss Fane . Enter ABBY . RODERICK DEAN How are you darling ? Do you know you 're five minutes late ? ABBY FANE Seems funny to go up the elevator thirty flights and climb two more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . There 's an old friend of yours here . p. 24 ABBY FANE Manny ! What are you doing here ? MANNY WALSH I 'm just leaving . RODERICK DEAN I want you to know my sister , Kay . KATHRYN DEAN Oh , how nice . I 'm awfully glad to meet you . ABBY FANE Same here . KATHRYN DEAN I heard you last night at the Hotsy Totsy and I was thrilled to death . RODERICK DEAN You 'd better be . ABBY FANE Go away . I wish I 'd known you were there . Did you like it ? KAY and ABBY chatter to each other and MANNY and ROD till ABBY 'S attentive ears hear ROD inquire of MANNY whether he wants another drink . MANNY WALSH In reply to ROD 'S question . Sure . ABBY FANE Another what ? MANNY WALSH Drink . ABBY FANE What 's come over you  --  drinking in the day time ? RODERICK DEAN Manny and I  --  I do n't have to call you Mr. Walsh , do I ?  --  have been having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink , Rod . He ca n't stand liquor . Three drinks and he 's under the table . Is n't that a laugh ? One of the biggest bootleggers in America  --  MANNY WALSH Truculently . Who 's bigger ! ABBY FANE That 's his touchy point . God , he 's vain ! You know , Rod , he 's just a great big baby , but you should n't really have let him drink to-day . To-day of all days ! He needs his wits about him . He 's being indicted all over the place . I 'm ashamed of you Manny . MANNY WALSH Say , I 've been indicted before . You think that worries me ? ABBY FANE Why did n't you tell me you were coming here ? MANNY WALSH Because I did n't think you 'd let me come . RODERICK DEAN His mission here is the most generous , really  --  ABBY FANE Oh , Manny 's a lamb , but he ca n't take care of himself . Drinks when he knows he should n't and eats the wrong things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That seems to be one of the penalties of greatness . MANNY WALSH It 's not a bad stomach exactly , it 's a nervous stomach . p. 26 ABBY FANE He 'll tell you about it in detail if you let him . MANNY WALSH I 've got to be going along . KATHRYN DEAN So have I. I want you to take me home in that magnificent car . I noticed it outside . ABBY FANE Now he 'll be your friend for life . That 's his pride and joy . MANNY WALSH With simple pride . It 's armored , you know . Same steel the Government uses for mail trucks . RODERICK DEAN To KAY . You 'll be safe at any rate . KATHRYN DEAN Archly . What about the foe within ? RODERICK DEAN I fear for you , Manny . MANNY WALSH Abby 'll tell you . I do n't take advantage of young girls . KATHRYN DEAN Abby  --  before I go  --  dare I Rod  --  ? RODERICK DEAN Kay is mad about your singing . ABBY FANE Is she ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear ? KATHRYN DEAN The one you sing at the Hotsy Totsy . ABBY FANE Certainly . Who 'll play for me ? p. 27 RODERICK DEAN I 've got it here . KATHRYN DEAN I 'll play . I 'd love to . She runs to the piano . ABBY sings the blues song which , a little while ago , SIGRIFT has so contemptuously anatomized . The words are surely banal if you think about them . But it is absurd to divorce them from the personality and emotion of the singer ; they become an eloquent and moving expression of sorrow , of melancholy , of frustration , of loneliness . Three various people are so affected ; RODERICK and MANNY and KAY ; it is as authentic an expression of romantic unhappiness as , for instance , a Russian Gypsy Song , which , pardonably , the SIGRIFTS are hysterical over . MANNY WALSH Reproachfully . After it is over . You sang it that time as if you were really carrying a torch . ABBY FANE That 's the way I always sing it . KATHRYN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything sound wonderful . Will you let me play you something I wrote some day ? ABBY FANE Sure . Play it now . KATHRYN DEAN Not now . Got to run now . Good-by , Abby . ABBY FANE So long , Kay . To MANNY . When will I see you , big boy ? p. 28 MANNY WALSH I 'll be around the club about midnight . ABBY FANE All right . To KAY . What are you doing tonight ? Let 's all meet around midnight . KATHRYN DEAN Maybe . Yes . I think so . To RODERICK . ' Bye dear . RODERICK DEAN So long Kay . To MANNY . ' Bye , Manny . See you later probably . MANNY WALSH Glad to have met you . RODERICK DEAN Thank you very much . Walking him to the door . I 'm so glad you came . KATHRYN DEAN Imagine being taken home in an armored car by a man with forty-seven indictments . MANNY WALSH Oh , that was the noon edition . KATHRYN DEAN Looking up at him admiringly as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MANNY WALSH I ca n't promise . But some other time I think I can arrange it . He winks at ROD and ABBY . They go out . RODERICK DEAN Are you sure you wo n't change your mind , dear , and have some tea ? A drink or something ? p. 29 ABBY FANE No , thanks , dear . I want to look around . RODERICK DEAN Go ahead . ABBY FANE Gee , it 's so high my ears hurt . RODERICK DEAN You like it ? ABBY FANE Oh , swell ! What a place for a party ! Why did n't you tip me off your sister was like that ? I was scared to meet her . RODERICK DEAN You were n't ! ABBY FANE Sure ! You know how families are ! I thought she 'd high-hat me . Gee , she 's swell ! RODERICK DEAN So 's your friend Manny swell ! ABBY FANE I 'm glad you like him . RODERICK DEAN So that 's the master racketeer ? The Napoleon of grafters ? Why he 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple ! He believes in Santa Claus . He 's positively touching . ABBY FANE Now do n't you fool yourself . Manny 's a pretty tough customer when you interfere with his racket . RODERICK DEAN What precisely is his racket ? ABBY FANE Everything from groceries to gin . RODERICK DEAN Rackets consolidated ! The merger age ! p. 30 ABBY FANE He 's smart . He 's awful smart , and awful stubborn , and cool , too . RODERICK DEAN But as you say  --  a baby . ABBY FANE Laughing . A mean baby ! RODERICK DEAN Really ? ABBY FANE You understand what I mean  --  he 's been a darling to me . Nobody  --  my own father could n't have been sweeter  --  but I imagine he 's pulled some pretty raw deals to get where he is . RODERICK DEAN The price of power . ABBY FANE You said it ! RODERICK DEAN Somehow I derive hope from the fact that this is a strong man . If that 's a strong man , well , why not me ? ABBY FANE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . RODERICK DEAN Then there is no hope ? ABBY FANE Oh , you do n't have to , anyway . RODERICK DEAN I may have to . There 's a pre-Revolutionary feel to everything . ABBY FANE You mean  --  Bolsheviki ? RODERICK DEAN Maybe . p. 31 ABBY FANE You 're kidding . RODERICK DEAN Why not ? ABBY FANE No , not in this country . We got too much sense . RODERICK DEAN Have we honey ? ABBY FANE Sure we have . Quit stringing me ! RODERICK DEAN I 'm not . I 'm delighted with you . I  --  ABBY FANE Yeh ?  --  honest ? RODERICK DEAN Honest . ABBY FANE It goes for me , too . RODERICK DEAN Does it ? Does it really ? You 've thought it over then ? ABBY FANE What ? RODERICK DEAN When I proposed to you the other night you said you wanted a day to think it over . ABBY FANE That 's right . I did . RODERICK DEAN Have you thought  --  ? ABBY FANE No . RODERICK DEAN Want another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . RODERICK DEAN No ! p. 32 ABBY FANE I knew at once I 'd accept you . RODERICK DEAN Really , you mean it ? ABBY FANE Yes . Embraces and kisses her . RODERICK DEAN This means so much to me . I ca n't tell you what it was like waiting . ABBY FANE The delay was just technique . What a sap I 'd be to refuse you . Sap 's not a good word to use , is it ? I wanted to make a good impression on your folks so I made a little list of words not to use . He laughs . Honest . Look here it is . Shows little slip of paper . Reads from it . Sap  --  hell  --  lousy  --  god damned  --  RODERICK DEAN Well sap 's all right . You can say sap . As for the rest they 're in common use with us . They smile at aach other . There is a pause , a hint of constraint . ABBY FANE By the way  --  what did Manny want ? RODERICK DEAN Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FANE Manny 's no chatter . What did he have to say ? RODERICK DEAN His mission was the most generous really  --  to tell me you had rejected him . p. 33 ABBY FANE Anything else ? RODERICK DEAN No , not especially . ABBY FANE I 've been meaning to tell you about Manny . RODERICK DEAN Why ? It is n't necessary . ABBY FANE No , but I want you to get it straight about us . All straight . Manny 's one guy I 'm not going to stop seeing . RODERICK DEAN I would n't give him up for worlds . ABBY FANE I 've known him ever since I was a little girl . He knew my father in Pittsburgh . He drove a taxi . That 's what my father did . Manny blew to New York . I decided one morning  --  I was waiting on table in a bum restaurant  --  that I wanted to go to New York , too  --  try the stage . Had n't the faintest idea what it was all about , but I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job in his night club . No one  --  my own father  --  could n't have been sweeter . I asked for a specialty and he let me do a specialty . For some reason he wants to marry me . Always has , he says . But you know  --  there 'd be no point in marrying Manny . What would marriage give us we have n't got now . Hastily . You know what I mean RODERICK DEAN Well  --  vaguely  --  p. 34 ABBY FANE What I mean is we 're just good friends . We do n't have to be married to be good friends . There 's nothing more between Manny and me . Not that I 'm a virgin or anything like that  --  RODERICK DEAN Murmuring . Who is ? ABBY FANE Manny is so respectable . He 'd be terribly shocked if he heard me talk like this . He puts me on a pedestal . It 's funny  --  I 've known him for so long , and I 've known you so little , and yet I could n't possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why is it ? RODERICK DEAN Perhaps Manny is a little inflexible . ABBY FANE Yeh  --  that 's it ! Everything 's cut and dried for Manny . He 's got a single-track mind . RODERICK DEAN That 's probably why he is so eminent in his profession . Men of action seldom have complicated minds . ABBY FANE Is your mind complicated ? RODERICK DEAN It 's often divided . ABBY FANE Is it divided about me ? RODERICK DEAN That 's curious  --  it 's not divided about you . ABBY FANE Thought maybe you wanted to back out . p. 35 RODERICK DEAN No , I have a feeling of absolute certainty about you . ABBY FANE Sometimes I feel you 're kidding  --  the way you talk  --  not about me alone  --  in general  --  RODERICK DEAN That 's a defense . ABBY FANE Why do you want to marry me ? It was the surprise of my young life when you asked me . You 're so nice . If you 'd asked me to live with you I 'd have said okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a feeling that sort of thing is rather complicated . ABBY FANE You have a feeling . Do n't you know ? RODERICK DEAN Only theoretically . ABBY FANE Gee , I thought that all rich men  --  RODERICK DEAN You must n't generalize  --  even about rich men . ABBY FANE Must n't I ? With a lavish gesture . Okay Chief . That 's out ! You see I 'm prepared to be an obedient wife . RODERICK DEAN After a moment . I hear you 're signing for the Scandals . ABBY FANE Yes . Is n't that swell ? p. 36 RODERICK DEAN Yes . ABBY FANE Perhaps you 'd rather I gave it up ? RODERICK DEAN Why ? Why should you ? ABBY FANE You do n't mind if I go on  --  ? RODERICK DEAN Of course not . Why should I stop you ? She squeezes his hand . I 'm crazy about your singing  --  ABBY FANE Well , it 's not really singing  --  RODERICK DEAN Whatever it is , I 'm crazy about it . ABBY FANE Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FANE Well you 're not the kind of a guy  --  I mean a fellow  --  I mean a chap  --  What do I mean Rod ? RODERICK DEAN You mean a guy . ABBY FANE Yeh  --  you 're not the kind of a guy who you think would fall for the sweet-and-low-down . RODERICK DEAN What do you think I 'd fall for ? ABBY FANE Oh , more like poetry  --  RODERICK DEAN Well , I like poetry , too . p. 37 ABBY FANE I 've got to get up in all that stuff . History , too . Do n't you think I ought to know history , too ? RODERICK DEAN It 's not indispensable . ABBY FANE I read Ludwig 's Napoleon . RODERICK DEAN How 'd you like it ? ABBY FANE Wonderful . There 's a guy ! I read it in my dressing-room between shows . The trap-drummer made such a hell of a noise it was hard to concentrate . RODERICK DEAN Perfect accompaniment for Napoleon ! ABBY FANE Appreciating it . Yeh ! Just a moment . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so ? ABBY FANE You bet I think so . RODERICK DEAN I expect you to persuade me . ABBY FANE You 're modest , are n't you ? RODERICK DEAN That 's the form my egotism takes . ABBY FANE I 'm not modest . I think I 'm pretty damned good . When I asked Manny for a specialty he thought I was crazy . I 'd never sung anything , but I knew I could do it . First time I sang I held ' em . You know it 's not easy to hold ' em in a lousy night club  --  I mean  --  yes that 's what I mean ! p. 38 RODERICK DEAN I adore you . ABBY FANE No kiddin ' ? RODERICK DEAN Utterly . ABBY FANE Why ? RODERICK DEAN You 've got such a grip  --  on reality . ABBY FANE Have n't you ? RODERICK DEAN Wavering . ABBY FANE Why ? What 's the matter ? You 're young . You 're rich . You 're attractive . You 've got everything in the world . He thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? RODERICK DEAN I 'm afraid  --  if I say it  --  it will sound absurd . ABBY FANE What if it does ? Go on . Say it ! A moment . RODERICK DEAN I 'm frightfully introspective I suppose . ABBY FANE What does that mean exactly ? RODERICK DEAN Think about myself  --  ABBY FANE So do I. All the time . Love it . RODERICK DEAN That 's different . But I  --  I think of myself in relation to the outside world  --  to life  --  and I seem to myself to be so highly  --  dispensable . I mean to say  --  I 've never had anything in my life that was intimate , personal  --  a part of me . I am surrounded by successful people , all of them much more talented than I am . I 've tried Art . I 've tried writing songs  --  p. 39 ABBY FANE Well what of it ! Tin Pan Alley ! If you knew the mugs I know who 're hits in Tin Pan Alley ! RODERICK DEAN No , that is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does express them . I 'm unemployed spiritually . Doubtful nod from ABBY . I have in a way an unfortunate heritage . My father is an over-bearing man who impressed it on me early in life that I must justify my existence . He shifted the burden of proof onto me . I simply want to convey to you that you are marrying a failure . ABBY FANE Do n't be like that , honey . Whenever you get blue  --  leave it to mamma . She 'll  --  look  --  She gives a long , low whistle and makes a graceful mesmeric gesture before his eyes . She repeats the movement . She 'll just whistle the blues away . You 'll be a success with me , honey . RODERICK DEAN I think so , too . But you 've got to help me . I 've gone from one thing to another . Ca n't find base . You must help me . ABBY FANE Course I will . Why do n't you go in with your father ? RODERICK DEAN Not quite the thing . Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the oxygen in a room . ABBY FANE Well , he wo n't live forever ! p. 40 RODERICK DEAN You 're wonderful ! ABBY FANE I do n't get it yet why you 're marrying me . Have you any idea how totally unsuited to each other we are ? Want to back out ? RODERICK DEAN No . ABBY FANE Try and do it ! RODERICK DEAN You 're everything I 'm not . I love you for it . ABBY FANE Same here . A pause . They sit holding each other 's hands . He touches her face . RODERICK DEAN You 're simply beautiful . She is deeply touched . ABBY FANE Roderick  --  RODERICK DEAN What is it , my dear ? ABBY FANE I ca n't do it , ca n't do it , Rod . No . Thought so , but I ca n't . RODERICK DEAN What do you mean ? Why not ? She gets up , walks away . After a moment he gets up , too . ABBY FANE Because I 've got nothing to offer you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judge of that . ABBY FANE I 'm not in love with you . p. 41 RODERICK DEAN Well , you 're fond of me , are n't you ? ABBY FANE I adore you . You 're too good to be true . RODERICK DEAN I 'll take that for a start . ABBY FANE No . It 's more than that . It 's that  --  I do n't want to fall in love again . As far as that sort of thing is concerned , I 'm willing to call it a day . You see , Rod  --  RODERICK DEAN Yes ? ABBY FANE I 've been in love once  --  terribly . Gee , why could n't it have been you ? Why did n't I meet you instead of him ? RODERICK DEAN Did you have bad luck ? ABBY FANE I had the damnedest time . Well , I got over it . It nearly killed me , but I finally did . I thought  --  when I met you  --  well , it seemed so nice . I did n't know there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a way out for me . Security . Independence . Nice life . That 's what I thought  --  that 's the low-down , Rod . But hell  --  you 're too nice for that . You can do better than that . I advise you to pass it up . RODERICK DEAN Do you ? ABBY FANE Well , you do n't have to take my advice if you do n't want to . p. 42 RODERICK DEAN This love affair  --  is it over ? ABBY FANE Over . RODERICK DEAN Really over ? Are you sure ? ABBY FANE Say , you get to a point you do n't feel anything , any more . RODERICK DEAN I do n't feel you 're jaded , somehow  --  ABBY FANE Rod  --  ! RODERICK DEAN I appreciate your telling me this . But since you say it 's over  --  I hope you 'll never mention it again . ABBY FANE Overcome . OK , you mean  --  I  --  RODERICK DEAN I do n't see quite how I could expect you to organize your past as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prolonged entrance music . It would be immensely flattering but I could scarcely expect it . If we can organize the future  --  we 'll be doing pretty well . ABBY FANE You 'll take a chance then ? RODERICK DEAN Embraces her . This is the wisest thing I 've ever done  --  Closer than I 've ever been  --  SIGRIFT appears in the doorway . He has been awakened from sleep . His hair and clothes are untidy , he is very cross. p. 43 HAROLD SIGRIFT This is a hell of a house . RODERICK DEAN Oh , Sig ! You 're just in time to wish me luck  --  HAROLD SIGRIFT That foolish butler of yours  --  RODERICK DEAN Believe it or not , Abby , that is Mr. Harold Sigrift . ABBY FANE Oh , hello ! HAROLD SIGRIFT Charmed ! It 's impossible to find repose in this house . I 'm going home . RODERICK DEAN What 's the matter , Sig ? HAROLD SIGRIFT Bootleggers chase you out of one room and butlers out of the other . RODERICK DEAN Did Trent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire and woke me up . A man who does that ought to be drawn and quartered . Just when I was napping with an angel . A fallen angel  --  to wake anybody up  --  at any time  --  is a major crime . ABBY FANE I hate to go to sleep . I feel I 'm missing something . RODERICK DEAN Abby lives in a real World . You and I are on the margin , Sig . HAROLD SIGRIFT Where 's Kay ? p. 44 RODERICK DEAN Mr. Walsh took her home in his armored car . HAROLD SIGRIFT Outrageous ! ABBY FANE Why ? HAROLD SIGRIFT Why ? Why ? It 's obvious why ! It 's the negation of caste  --  that 's what 's ruining everything  --  it 's the invasion of democracy  --  it 's the abeyance of civilization ABBY FANE So what ? RODERICK DEAN Before you insult Abby , Sig , let me tell you that we 're going to be married . HAROLD SIGRIFT Outrageous ! Now , why did n't you refuse him Abby ? You 'd make a name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixes drink . HAROLD SIGRIFT Social distinctions are so relaxed nowadays your marriage probably wo n't even cause a ripple . ABBY FANE I think I can get it in the Mirror . RODERICK DEAN By the way , Abby , I probably neglected to tell you , Sig can be intensely disagreeable . ABBY FANE What you need is a drink , you old bear ! HAROLD SIGRIFT Do n't get familiar with me , young lady . You hardly know me. p. 45 ABBY FANE Say ! I bet you and me are going to be swell friends . HAROLD SIGRIFT You have delusions of grandeur . ABBY FANE I do n't think he likes me , honey . HAROLD SIGRIFT On his way to door . How do I know whether I like you . I do n't know you , but I thoroughly disapprove of you . ABBY FANE Why ? RODERICK DEAN Come on back here Sig . You were quite excited when you heard her in the night club . HAROLD SIGRIFT Stopping . That 's different . Now must I be frank about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be frank . HAROLD SIGRIFT In a night club I appreciate you . I appreciate you as a symbol of our raucous and mechanical civilization , but when you invade the home  --  RODERICK DEAN Oh , come , come , now Sig ! A profligate like you defending the home ABBY is engaged in rouging her lips . HAROLD SIGRIFT And when your racketeering , bootlegging friend , who should n't be allowed in the house except to deliver his wares with the other tradesmen , comes swaggering in at the front door , meets us on a plane of equality , takes home our sister  --  p. 46 ABBY FANE Really angry . Manny 's all right ! HAROLD SIGRIFT By what standards , young lady ? Tell me that . By what standards ? ABBY FANE Unwilling to go into the question of standards . Oh , nuts to you ! HAROLD SIGRIFT Triumphant to have elicited this solecism as he goes out gloating his satisfaction to ROD . Washed in poetry  --  bathed in glamor  --  ROD turns to ABBY , quite delighted . ABBY is calmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much for the list . With him around , this is baby talk . Next time I meet professor Sigrift , I 'm going to have a few longer words myself . RODERICK DEAN Oh , do n't mind Sig  --  he 's really kindly underneath all that  --  ABBY FANE Oh , I think he 's swell . RODERICK DEAN And I think you 're wonderful . Gosh , what fun you 'll be ! Just be yourself , Abby  --  that 's all I ask . ABBY FANE Oh , I 'll be much better than that . RODERICK DEAN Have you any idea how totally unsuited we are to each other ? p. 47 ABBY FANE I 'm just getting the idea . RODERICK DEAN We have absolutely nothing in common . It should be an exciting marriage . Think of the thrill of discovery . ABBY FANE Do n't think I do n't know what a great break this is for me . I 'll make it up to you . I 'll do you justice . You wo n't be ashamed of me , honey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can imitate anybody . I 'll imitate your friends . RODERICK DEAN Will you ? ABBY FANE Watch me honey . In six months  --  honest Rod , I promise you  --  I 'll do a better act than they do . What time is it darling ? Looks at his wrist watch . Got to go . RODERICK DEAN I thought you were staying for dinner . ABBY FANE Mm  --  mm ! You 've had enough of me for one day  --  besides , I 've got a rehearsal . RODERICK DEAN Cut the rehearsal . ABBY FANE No , sir . Ca n't do that . It 's going to be a grand number . Wait till you hear it . You 'll be mad about it . RODERICK DEAN I 'll go with you  --  ABBY FANE No . I want to go alone . Just this once , honey . p. 48 RODERICK DEAN Why ? ABBY FANE Got a lot to think about  --  OK sweet ? RODERICK DEAN OK darling . When will I see you ? ABBY FANE The great lady for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Mr. Deane . May have a spare fifteen minutes late in January ! I 'll call you in an hour . Bye , darling . She blows him a kiss and is off to her career . He stands looking after her ravished. @x SCENE : The same . Eighteen months later . It is late afternoon in April . AT RISE : ABBY , wearing a lovely tea gown , is serving tea to the famous Russian moving picture director , SERGEI VOLOSCHIN . SERGEI is a stocky , black-haired genial fellow of about thirty-five . ABBY FANE I 've always been fascinated by Russia . It 's the one country I 've always wanted to see . I can imagine it and yet  --  I ca n't imagine it . You know what I mean ? SERGEI VOLOSCHYN If you say the word , I 'll take you there . ABBY FANE How can you ? You 're going to Hollywood . SERGEI VOLOSCHYN I would cancel Hollywood . I have misgivings now about Hollywood . ABBY FANE Why ? I lunched the other day with Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carte blanche . SERGEI VOLOSCHYN Darkly . I have misgivings . Listen Abby  --  He takes her hand impulsively . Come with me to Russia . ABBY FANE Are you serious ? SERGEI VOLOSCHYN Utterly serious . p. 50 ABBY FANE It 's not practical . SERGEI VOLOSCHYN The boat sails Monday . ABBY FANE It is n't just the transportation , Sergei  --  other details . SERGEI VOLOSCHYN What details ? ABBY FANE Husband . SERGEI VOLOSCHYN Yes , you make much of marriage here . ABBY FANE I do n't think too much . SERGEI VOLOSCHYN My country has the only civilized divorce laws . There  --  once a marriage has outlasted its spiritual significance  --  you have only to ask for a divorce to get it . ABBY FANE Either party ? SERGEI VOLOSCHYN Either party . ABBY FANE That 's nice in one way and yet in another way I can see it might cause considerable inconvenience . SERGEI gulps his tea . SERGEI VOLOSCHYN These idiotic cups  --  there is no tea in them . ABBY FANE Oh , I 'm so sorry . You like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am sorry .  --  Wait I 'll  --  SERGEI VOLOSCHYN Stops her as she is about to ring . No , do n't ! Forgive me . I am a moujik  --  a simple peasant . That was very rude of me . Tell me , why do you tolerate me ? p. 51 ABBY FANE Why ? Because you fascinate me , and even if you did n't I still think you have a right to drink your tea out of a glass if you want to . She rings . Tolerate you ! Sergei dear , when I sat in that little stuffy room yesterday while they were running your picture , for the first time I felt the power and terror of the Russian people . SERGEI VOLOSCHYN Men in the mass ! That 's all that interests me . It is an age of mass . Proletariat rampant . What is the French Revolution compared to our Revolution ? The individual no longer . He has been relegated to oblivion by modern and by modern philosophy also . The great movements of masses of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sergei . I 'll never forget those faces SERGEI VOLOSCHYN Facets of the crowd  --  Yes , I 'm pretty good on faces . MAID brings in glasses for tea and goes out . ABBY pours  --  SERGEI gulps . Do you remember the tortured face of the woman that suddenly lifted itself in the execution scene ? ABBY FANE Which one ? None of them were exactly gay . SERGEI VOLOSCHYN The one with the tortured face upthrust near the cartwheel. p. 52 ABBY FANE Oh , yes , I do remember . SERGEI VOLOSCHYN My Aunt Olga  --  ABBY FANE Really  --  poor dear , could n't you do something for her , Sergei ? SERGEI VOLOSCHYN It is impossible for one person to help another . We are all of us isolated souls crying in the wilderness . Do you speak to me ? ABBY FANE Why , Sergei ! It seems to me we run on forever . SERGEI VOLOSCHYN Contemptuously . Words ! Words ! ABBY FANE Innocently . What do they use in Russia ? He bangs his glass , walks about moodily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much between us . I am a simple peasant . What am I doing here ? ABBY FANE What am I ? SERGEI VOLOSCHYN You are the exquisite product of a luxurious aristocracy . Why should I aspire to you ? ABBY FANE Why not ? I feel  --  if I were in Russia  --  I should be closer to the peasants than to the aristocracy ! SERGEI VOLOSCHYN My kind angel . He bends over her hand and kisses it . The BUTLER comes in. p. 53 BUTLER Mr. Worthing . ABBY FANE Ask him up . And Trent , have these things taken away . The BUTLER goes out . You 're going to the theater to-night , are n't you ? SERGEI VOLOSCHYN Yes , with the head of my studio . Material ! I 'm skeptical . ABBY FANE Come in afterwards . Bring Mr. What's-his-name . CASS WORTHING comes in . He is a famous polo player . He is very dark and very handsome . Hello Cass . CASS WORTHING Hello ! ABBY FANE Sergei , this is Mr. Worthing . This is Sergei @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casual . How do you do ? SERGEI bows . ABBY FANE Do come in afterwards , Sergei , and bring your executive . SERGEI VOLOSCHYN If you will forgive me , I do not think so . There will be a great crowd  --  ABBY FANE I thought you liked men in the mass . SERGEI VOLOSCHYN Grinning . In peasant smocks . Not in evening dress . ABBY walks with him to the door. p. 54 ABBY FANE Good-by , Sergei . Change your mind and come in . There will be some people I want you to meet . Akerson the novelist and Dr. Vick , the psychologist  --  latest thing from Vienna . SERGEI VOLOSCHYN And I 'm the latest thing from Moscow . You import us . In any case I will telephone you tomorrow  --  the usual time .  --  ABBY FANE I 'll expect you . SERGEI VOLOSCHYN Kisses her hand . Good-by , dear lady . He is off , blowing kisses . As he goes out he confronts the MAID who steps aside for him to pass . She enters , takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sits , sighs , lights a cigarette . CASS WORTHING It 's a relay race . Who follows me ? ABBY FANE Nobody . You 're the climax . CASS WORTHING You 'll be dressing for dinner . ABBY FANE I 've got at least half an hour . CASS WORTHING Like an appointment at the dentist 's . ABBY FANE Why are you so unpleasant , Cass ? I got rid of Sergei to be alone with you . p. 55 CASS WORTHING What are you doing with that kind of ruck ? ABBY FANE Adjusting cushions . How intolerant you are , Cass . CASS WORTHING Lucky for you , you are married to a nut like Deane . ABBY FANE I beg your pardon  --  CASS WORTHING Russian movie directors ! No sane man would stand for it . ABBY FANE Anything else , Cass ? CASS WORTHING Yes . Why did n't you show up yesterday ? ABBY FANE I telephoned . Did n't your man tell you ? CASS WORTHING I got your message . You could n't come . That did n't tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . I could n't very well refuse . CASS WORTHING You could have said you had an engagement  --  had to see a dressmaker or something . ABBY FANE Thought I 'd better not . CASS WORTHING I gave up a damn good polo match . ABBY FANE I 'm sorry . CASS WORTHING What about to-night ? p. 56 ABBY FANE Ca n't  --  dinner party . CASS WORTHING Later ? ABBY FANE Doubtful . People coming in . CASS WORTHING I think I know what 's the matter with you , Abby , you 've gone lady on me . You were more amusing in the old days . ABBY FANE Do n't quite believe that ? CASS WORTHING Nevertheless  --  it 's true . ABBY FANE The evidence is against it . The evidence supplied by yourself . In the old days , as you fondly call them , you took me very casually , as a matter-of-fact . Do you remember that ? Now I must say you are a little more attentive . Contradictory , old dear . CASS WORTHING Do n't get subtle on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of subtlety ! That 's not subtle , Cass . That 's elementary . You should hear me in a real conversation . CASS WORTHING Thanks , I 'll pass it up . ABBY FANE In a conversation for instance with a clever man . There is a pause . He goes to her , sits at her feet on chaise longue. p. 57 CASS WORTHING You 're bitter . ABBY FANE Do you think so ? CASS WORTHING You ca n't forgive me  --  but I 'll make you . I 'll make you forgive me . And once you 've forgiven me  --  you 'll forget that you ever resented me . ABBY FANE Now you 're getting complicated . It 's not your style . CASS WORTHING Significantly . You know what I mean ? ABBY FANE Her hand runs over his hair . Just a simple polo player . He takes her hand and kisses it . She looks at him . Handsome . CASS WORTHING Abby ABBY FANE Judicially . Quite a figure of a young man . CASS WORTHING Abby you know I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deprecatory sound . Husband or no husband ! ABBY FANE Why ? CASS WORTHING Because you know what we were to each other . ABBY FANE Hardly remember . p. 58 CASS WORTHING You 're a liar . ABBY FANE Another life , Cass dear . CASS WORTHING You 're my kind . You 're more like me than anybody . ABBY FANE Why do so many people say that to me ? The only man I ever knew who did n't was Manny . He acknowledges a certain difference  --  all in his favor . So does Rod , as a matter of fact  --  all in my favor . CASS WORTHING Saw Manny last night , dropped in at the Hotsy-Totsy . ABBY FANE Manny will be here to-night . CASS WORTHING Old place is n't the same . ABBY FANE Mocking . That 's nice . CASS WORTHING Furious that his romantic suggestions meet an ironic response . What the devil 's the matter with you anyway ? She laughs . What the hell are you laughing at ? ABBY FANE Your line , Cass . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Hotsy-Totsy . Old Heidelberg , Old Lang Syne . Old stuff . He gets up in a rage . She lies there smoking , watching him . What a temper you have ! It 's becoming to you . p. 59 CASS WORTHING Turning abruptly . What 's your game ? ABBY FANE Fixing pillow . My what , Cass ? CASS WORTHING Why do you see me ? Why do you make dates with me ? Why do you break them ? If you 're no longer interested , say so and I 'll clear out . ABBY FANE All right , I 'm no longer interested . CASS WORTHING You lie like Hell . ABBY FANE Mr. Worthing ! Supremely confident of an old and oft-exercised power he sits beside her on the sofa and puts his arm around her shoulders . CASS WORTHING Abby  --  ABBY FANE Yes ? CASS WORTHING The other day  --  in the restaurant  --  when I ran into you for the first time since  --  when you looked at me  --  ABBY FANE What happened when I looked at you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear  --  I said hello , and we shook hands . What of it ? CASS WORTHING I know you so well , Abby . p. 60 ABBY FANE Do you ? CASS WORTHING I know  --  and you know  --  that it is the same . ABBY FANE Oh , much better , I think , Cass . Pause . I believe  --  if I remember  --  I think  --  I 'd just began to bore you a little bit . But I 'll never bore you again , Cass  --  I promise . You 're going to find me much more entertaining . CASS WORTHING The other day when I saw you  --  I said to my-self  --  ABBY FANE That 's what I want to know ! What did you say to yourself ? How did I look to you ? CASS WORTHING I said to myself , " Why , she 's radiant  --  she 's  --  ! " ABBY FANE Life in the old girl yet , eh ? Well , what did you expect  --  I grieved for a bit , but  --  life must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it up to you , Abby . ABBY FANE Will you ? Do you think you can ? CASS WORTHING Yes , I think I can . ABBY FANE I 'm afraid , Mr. Worthing , that the old spark 's not there any more . CASS WORTHING It is n't , eh ? Oh , it is n't , eh ? He takes her in his arms and kisses her passionately and repeatedly . SIGRIFT lumbers in. p. 61 HAROLD SIGRIFT Good God  --  ! CASS rises not fussed much . He calmly removes ABBY 'S rouge from his lips and turns to SIGRIFT , whom he despises as an intellectual , insolently . ABBY FANE You see , Cass , how utterly absurd it is to attempt rape here . Completely impractical . CASS WORTHING Hello , Sig ! HAROLD SIGRIFT Oh ! You here ! RODERICK enters . RODERICK DEAN Cordially . Hello , Cass ! CASS WORTHING How are you ? He strides out . ABBY FANE Cass is positively gauche ! RODERICK DEAN What 's the matter with him ? ABBY FANE Over her shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's known as a situation , Sig ? HAROLD SIGRIFT It used to be . RODERICK DEAN Perhaps it will make things simpler if I change the subject . ABBY FANE What a darling you are . Come here . She waves him over . He sits beside her on the chaise longue . Kisses him . How are you honey ? Where have you been ? p. 62 RODERICK DEAN Well , believe it or not , I 've been to the Public Library . ABBY FANE Why , precious ? The house is full of books . RODERICK DEAN Not as full as the Public Library . Want a drink , Sig ? HAROLD SIGRIFT No . ABBY FANE I want one . HAROLD SIGRIFT Yes . RODERICK DEAN Mixing drinks . You know the Research Department on 42nd Street . I 'd never been there . It 's a most amazing place . ABBY FANE Why ? RODERICK DEAN Well , I 've been having an argument with Sig . HAROLD SIGRIFT To ABBY . I beg you to understand that in order to argue with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FANE What was it about ? RODERICK DEAN I wanted to justify my social attitude to Sig . I told him the aristocrats were always pioneers in Revolution . I had a wild idea of writing an essay . ABBY FANE Did you find anything , baby ? She fondles him. p. 63 RODERICK DEAN Did I ! Gosh ! HAROLD SIGRIFT There are eccentrics among the aristocrats , just as there are imbeciles among the poor . What does it prove either way ? RODERICK DEAN But the amazing thing to me was that vast room with hundreds of people sitting there , intent , concentrated , this island of silence in the clangor of the city . I got a pile of books in front of me and began to read . Prince Kropotkin . The biographical part was charming . But when he got into economics , I could n't follow . I got lost . I realized that I was n't equipped , even to argue with Sig . I tried another tack  --  but those immense vistas of reference , those interlocked roads , stretching into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the girl sitting across from me had n't moved . She looked up at me over the edge of her book , impersonally . None of the people there had moved . They were sitting there intent , concentrated , I imagine they are still sitting there . They 'll sit there something . RODERICK DEAN All right . What do you want to look up ? HAROLD SIGRIFT Famous women of history ! p. 64 ABBY FANE Not at all . Table manners . I 'm interested in the evolution of table manners . RODERICK DEAN Amusing subject  --  from the thumb to the oyster fork . HAROLD SIGRIFT In one generation . He has been looking through a magazine and now throws it aside . Revolting . RODERICK DEAN What is ? HAROLD SIGRIFT These rancid magazines . There used to be a charming society in this town presided over by gracious women , now they 're all mattress-indorsers . ABBY FANE What are you going to do about it , Sig ? HAROLD SIGRIFT Just what I 'm doing now . ABBY FANE Hand me a cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for her . RODERICK DEAN Cass Worthing is a chap I envy . HAROLD SIGRIFT Apropos of what ? RODERICK DEAN Thoroughly self-sufficient . HAROLD SIGRIFT With malice . Occasionally he requires  --  cooperation . ABBY FANE Shaking her head . Oh , Sig , Sig , if you were a woman , what a bitch you would have made ! She sits up. p. 65 HAROLD SIGRIFT Could n't resist it , sweetheart ! ABBY FANE I 'll explain to you , Rod , the meaning of that innuendo . It is this : that when Sig came into the room , he saw Worthing kissing me . But he did it without encouragement . It was not coperative . HAROLD SIGRIFT It 's always better to hear about these things from your wife than from your best friend . RODERICK DEAN He is affected but he ca n't bear to show it . I started to say  --  I envy Worthing  --  and I envied him even without knowing that Abby kissed him . HAROLD SIGRIFT He kissed Abby . ABBY FANE Thank you , Sig . HAROLD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started the great war ? RODERICK DEAN Annoyed . Stop chattering , Sig . I envy him because he does n't worry about anything . Is n't troubled by anything  --  never thinks about anything , but his own pleasure . The world is a background for his sporting instincts , all his instincts . Do n't blame you , Abby . Mercutio ! HAROLD SIGRIFT A Mercutio with a few minor exceptions . A Mercutio without wit or humor or loyalty or real courage or gallantry . A moron-Mercutio. p. 66 RODERICK DEAN He flies to Havana . HAROLD SIGRIFT Courage of a kind . After all Rod , cowardice is a kind of imagination . Worthing 's safe . RODERICK DEAN Nevertheless , I envy him . I wish I were like him . HAROLD SIGRIFT Do you know Abby , the chief difference between Rod and me is that he envies all the attributes he has n't got . I despise all the attributes I have n't got . ABBY FANE That 's why you 're fat and Rod 's thin . A moment 's pause . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is n't ! I 've got to be thinking about dressing for dinner . HAROLD SIGRIFT Getting up . Who 've you got sitting next to me at dinner ? ABBY FANE Dr. Lehman . She 's a psychoanalyst . She 's very well known . HAROLD SIGRIFT Has it ever occurred to you , Rod , that Abby is a celebrity  --  glutton ? ABBY FANE Dr. Lehman is coming to meet Dr. Vick from Vienna . He 's a great man , Dr. Vick . HAROLD SIGRIFT Everybody from Vienna is a great man . A considerate hostess would have put me next to a chorus girl ? p. 67 ABBY FANE Not if she were considerate of the chorus girl . I 've got one on the other side of you . Ex  --  HAROLD SIGRIFT The American scene . ABBY FANE Dr. Lehman 's pretty . HAROLD SIGRIFT I do n't believe it . He goes out . There is a silence . She looks at RODERICK . ABBY FANE Come here baby . He obeys . Here  --  Makes him sit beside her . Blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mamma . Look dearest  --  look  --  vanish  --  all gone .  --  She utters a long , low whistle and makes the same wave-gesture she did before . Gone ? Gone ? RODERICK DEAN Gone . ABBY FANE Not entirely though . Have I lost my magic ? RODERICK DEAN What did you do to-day ? ABBY FANE I received . RODERICK DEAN For instance ? ABBY FANE Sergei Voloschyn , the famous director from Russia . p. 68 RODERICK DEAN Oh , that chap . Fake , is n't he ? ABBY FANE Yes  --  he is a fake . But I 'll say this for him  --  I do n't think he knows it . RODERICK DEAN How shrewd you are . ABBY FANE Oh , I 'm keen ! RODERICK DEAN Putting pillow behind her . Happy ? ABBY FANE Most . After all , why should n't I be ? I 'm a simple extrovert . RODERICK DEAN How you do pick up the patois ! ABBY FANE I told you  --  I could imitate anything . RODERICK DEAN Just a mimic at heart . ABBY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit wistfully . What are you besides ? Are you anything besides ? ABBY FANE Have you no idea ? RODERICK DEAN I vary . ABBY FANE That 's my game . RODERICK DEAN I adore you . ABBY FANE I adore you . RODERICK DEAN Really ? p. 69 ABBY FANE Really . It 's curious  --  RODERICK DEAN What ? ABBY FANE You make me happy  --  utterly , but I do n't make you . RODERICK DEAN It 's not your fault , it 's my own . ABBY FANE It 's the only fleck , just that bit of failure . But I 'll overcome that . I 'll capture you . RODERICK DEAN You have . You have . ABBY FANE Not entirely . Not to my satisfaction . I 'm ravenous you know . RODERICK DEAN Are you ? ABBY FANE Yes . For everything  --  for life . I adore it . I adore lying here with you close to me waiting to dress for dinner . And you know , Rod , I think of all the people doing the same thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I get an awful kick out of it . RODERICK DEAN Parvenu ! ABBY FANE Of course . There 's nothing in the world so delicious as being a parvenu . I 'm sorry for you because you ca n't be one . Why , when I go into the Hotsy-Totsy now I feel like a great lady visiting the poor . I 'd like to have the Prince of Wales and Lindbergh here to dine  --  not because I 'm hot about those two boys but simply as an indication of the social distance I 've traveled. p. 70 RODERICK DEAN You 're incredible !  --  You know I get some kind of thrill out of it too , when I see you babbling away at dinner .  --  I hear scraps of your conversation sometimes  --  all sorts of odds and ends of art chatter  --  even science  --  I feel like an impresario who 's put over a brilliant hoax . ABBY FANE Do you ? RODERICK DEAN Of course . Do you think I am without petty vanity ? But what kind of thrill is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? RODERICK DEAN It 's a little second rate , is n't it ? ABBY FANE You 're too critical . RODERICK DEAN I am , I know I am . ABBY FANE You 're too serious . RODERICK DEAN I know that too . Pause . ABBY FANE I 'm dazzled by myself ca n't believe it now you take Dr. Vick for instance . He studies in Vienna . He practices in Vienna . He writes books translated all over the world , and then at the end of all this preparation he comes here for dinner . RODERICK DEAN Perhaps it 's more an incident than a culmination . p. 71 ABBY FANE He told me it 's a culmination . RODERICK DEAN What do you do to these men ? ABBY FANE What did I do to you ? RODERICK DEAN Flirt . Siren . Vampire . ABBY FANE It 's all in fun , Rod . RODERICK DEAN Is it ? ABBY FANE Do n't be suspicious . It 's no good because you will never know . Oh , this is the prize laugh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ABBY FANE Sergei to-day . He was going on about being a peasant and he said that he and I could never get together in a big way because  --  you 'll never guess why , precious . RODERICK DEAN Because you 're a peasant too ? ABBY FANE No . That 's no laugh . Because  --  let 's see what was I  --  the exquisite flower of a complicated aristocracy . That 's what I am ! The Gulf is too great on account of that , Rod . Now laugh that off . RODERICK DEAN You ought to go to Russia and be the peasant 's pet . They laugh . ABBY FANE When he said that I made a mental note to repeat it to you  --  verbatim . She says words like this with an air of triumph , with a sense of pulling them off. p. 72 RODERICK DEAN Marvelous ! ABBY FANE That 's the sweetest thing  --  to sit here with you like this and tell you  --  when I 'm with these men  --  and they say these things  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them  --  for my darling  --  to make him laugh . RODERICK DEAN That 's a by-product of your coquetry . Is it the main motive ? ABBY FANE Besides all that  --  I rather like it . RODERICK DEAN I suspected that . ABBY FANE I 'm afraid I do . RODERICK DEAN You have  --  I 've noticed it  --  the faculty of making each man you talk to think you 're profoundly interested in him . ABBY FANE Well , I think I am . I like people much more than you do . You 're a solitary . RODERICK DEAN Your social energy is enormous . It quite wears me out . ABBY FANE Why ? You do n't have to do anything about it . RODERICK DEAN I have to attend your dinner parties . I must eat somewhere you know . ABBY FANE Good for you . Takes you out of yourself . p. 73 RODERICK DEAN Into what ? Into some better medium ? ABBY FANE Conceited . RODERICK DEAN No , that 's absurd . Why escape from oneself ?  --  why get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a lot of chattering mediocrities . ABBY FANE That 's not true . The most distinguished people in town come to my house . RODERICK DEAN Like hell they do . ABBY FANE Dr. Leopold Vick  --  RODERICK DEAN I do n't know Dr. Leopold Vick . Maybe he 's distinguished . I do n't know . But if he is , you do n't get his distinction . All you get is his parlor talk . I 'm not saying one or two first-raters do n't occasionally drift in here . Must on the theory of averages . But they 're not first rate while they are here . They are just stuffed shirts while they are here . Of all the indoor-sports celebrity-hunting is the tamest and the most fatuous . The biggest this and the most celebrated that . It 's vulgar . ABBY FANE Why should I be refined ? It 's nothing but a damn bore ! RODERICK DEAN You pick up every argot , you 're mixed up in a hundred sets . Underneath these layers of adaptive coloring  --  what are you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I married a Grand Duchess . p. 74 ABBY FANE What made you think I was a simple person ? Just because I sang in a Night Club ? Why did n't you wait to discover ? I 'm not any more simple than you are . We 're both complicated  --  in different ways . But if you want me to chuck all this  --  all right I will . After this week no one will step in the house  --  except your friend Sig , of course  --  we 'll dine alone every night , the three of us ! She is on her feet now with her back arched . RODERICK DEAN I wo n't subject you to that extremity or boredom . A moment 's pause . ABBY FANE What do you expect ? I admit I am ravenous  --  do you know my youth ? Perhaps I 'll get tired of this . Just now I get a kick out of it . What of it ? I thought it amused you to see me playing the rle and getting away with it . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret bitterness . All right , I 'll cut it out . I 'll cut everything out you want to cut out . Let 's go up in the North Woods somewhere and build an igloo and discover each other . RODERICK DEAN When I said you make every man you talk to feel that you are profoundly interested in him I should have excluded myself . ABBY FANE Overcome with contrition . Oh , darling  --  I 'm a beast . She rushes to him. p. 75 RODERICK DEAN Let 's not quarrel , Abby . You know it 's like war  --  I could n't survive victory . ABBY FANE Glibly . And neither could I. RODERICK DEAN You agree too readily . You could survive anything . ABBY FANE Do you know what the trouble is ? RODERICK DEAN What ? ABBY FANE The trouble is you do n't love me . RODERICK DEAN Is that the trouble ? ABBY FANE Yes . It is . You married  --  not me  --  you married an ideal . Simple , elemental  --  God knows what . Not me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ABBY FANE And I you . You foolish boy . What are you worrying about ? What are you worrying about ? RODERICK DEAN We 're so different . ABBY FANE You always knew that . RODERICK DEAN At first the difference stimulated me , now  --  ABBY FANE Now ? RODERICK DEAN I want to bridge it  --  to be close to you  --  I ca n't . I do n't know how . I  --  p. 76 ABBY FANE You do n't have to do anything . Look  --  look  --  look  --  She kisses him three times , his head between her hands . Do n't you think I know what you 've done for me ? Do n't you think I know how precious you are , and sensitive , and dear . Other men are just crude beside you  --  just crocks  --  Darling , I love you . RODERICK DEAN I love you . They embrace . ABBY FANE Pulling away . It must be shockingly late . I hate to dress quickly . I like to linger over it . RODERICK DEAN Holding her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's too obvious . That 's just what they 'd expect from me . He is delighted with her and at ease all over again . She stands near him a moment . Is it all right ? All blown away ? She makes the familiar gesture . RODERICK DEAN All blown away . ABBY FANE You wo n't be jealous any more ? RODERICK DEAN Jealous ! ABBY FANE Of course . That 's what all this is about . That silly Sigrift . But what I told you , honey , is absolutely true . Worthing kissed me ! It was his idea  --  not mine . Bye , darling ! She runs off , blowing him a kiss . Everything abruptly goes dead on him. p. 77 RODERICK DEAN Devastated . Damn ! Damn ! Damn ! CURTAIN p. 78 Act 2 , Scene 2 ACT TWO SCENE II : The same . It is more than six hours later . Around one in the morning . From downstairs comes the music of the dance orchestra . AT RISE : CASS and ABBY . ABBY is radiant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CASS WORTHING This is the only place where you can talk ABBY FANE You should n't have come here . CASS WORTHING Everybody else in town did . Why not me ? ABBY FANE You should n't be drinking . CASS WORTHING What should I be doing ? ABBY FANE You were never a graceful drinker . Liquor brings you out unfortunately . CASS WORTHING I had no idea of coming here . Honest . This afternoon when I left you I said to myself : that 's that ! I called it quits . I could have killed you . ABBY FANE Tst ! Ts ! Ts ! Ts ! CASS WORTHING If that fat slob and your husband had n't come in  --  ABBY FANE Sig may be fat , my dear Cass , but compared to his your brain is a featherbed . p. 79 CASS WORTHING The intellecual Abby ! Music swells into the room . Come here . Let 's dance . They dance . ABBY FANE What made you forgive me ? CASS WORTHING I did n't . I tell you I never intended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WORTHING I went around to the Club and had a fast workout and a shower . I thought that would fix me up . ABBY FANE Delighted . Oh , Cass ! Do you mean to tell me I survived a fast workout ? CASS WORTHING You did . ABBY FANE It must be love ! CASS WORTHING I had some drinks with Winnie Dashiell and we called up a couple of girls . ABBY FANE Did n't they turn up ? CASS WORTHING Oh , they turned up all right . We went to Pete 's on Fifty-second Street . Then we went to George 's in the Village . Remember you and I used to go there ? ABBY FANE I remember . CASS WORTHING Well we sat around and drank for a while and then the four of us went to Winnie's. p. 80 ABBY FANE Spare me the rest , Cass . CASS WORTHING No , that 's just the point . ABBY FANE What 's the point ? CASS WORTHING I thought I was having a pretty good time and yet I was n't having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FANE I know that twilight-region  --  yes  --  CASS WORTHING I felt restless . ABBY FANE You felt restless . They stop dancing . CASS WORTHING All of a sudden I realized what was the matter with me . You ! I just walked out on Winnie and the girls . ABBY FANE That was rude . CASS WORTHING I hardly thought about it . First thing I knew I was in a taxi coming here . ABBY FANE You 're too impulsive . CASS WORTHING Yes , I am . It 's you that 's calculating . ABBY FANE I do n't flatter myself .  --  All these drinks . CASS WORTHING Drinks hell . For God 's sake , Abby , chuck this God-damn pose and be yourself . If you want to be respectable , I 'll marry you . p. 81 ABBY FANE You know how safe you are . CASS WORTHING Safe ! I tell you I 'll walk out with you to-night  --  right now . I 'm going to Florida to-morrow  --  flying , I 'll take you . ABBY FANE I think taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CASS WORTHING I ca n't . I tell you , I ca n't ! ABBY FANE We used to have a kind of receding date to go to Florida , did n't we ? We were always going to Florida  --  you dangled Florida in front of me  --  somehow we never went . CASS WORTHING We will now  --  Dashiell will be down there . We 'll stay on his houseboat . We 'll go sail fishing and have a hell of a time . ABBY FANE People will talk , Cass . They might even put two and two together . CASS WORTHING For God 's sake , Abby . ca n't you see I 'm serious ? ABBY FANE I may go down with Rod . I 'll see you that way . CASS WORTHING The hell with Rod . ABBY FANE I think I can manage it . CASS WORTHING I tell you  --  ABBY FANE I 'm sorry , Cass , but that 's the only way . Come on  --  let 's dance some more . I like to dance with you . p. 82 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FANE Then I 've got to go back to my guests . CASS WORTHING They 're dancing . They do n't know you 're alive . ABBY FANE A few of them do , Cass . CASS WORTHING Loudly . What are you afraid of  --  that 's what I ca n't see . ABBY FANE Quieting him . Afraid ! I 'm not afraid of anything . What makes you think I ca n't live without you ? I 'm doing very well . CASS WORTHING I ca n't live without you . ABBY FANE Oh , nonsense . Go South and sailfish . Come downstairs and have another drink . She starts out . He grasps her hand , holds her . CASS WORTHING Look here  --  ABBY FANE Besides  --  I know you of old  --  and you are unreliable ! CASS WORTHING Ah ! That 's it ! You do n't trust me . ABBY FANE Are you surprised at that ? CASS WORTHING Listen , Abby . I was a fool before but now  --  Abby , listen  --  give me another chance , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abby , damn it , it is n't as if we 've never been anything to each other  --  I  --  p. 83 ABBY FANE Cut it out ! I hate reminiscence and I 'm not overfond of the past . She is very definite . She breaks away from him . CASS WORTHING You 've got to . He grabs her . ABBY FANE Now for pity 's sake , Cass , do n't attack me again . CASS WORTHING You ca n't turn me down like this . ABBY FANE I 'm not turning you down . I 'll see you in Florida . CASS WORTHING Do n't stall me any more  --  ABBY FANE All right then , let 's call it a day . CASS WORTHING Will you have lunch with me to-morrow ? ABBY FANE Call me . CASS WORTHING What about late to-night ? ABBY FANE Difficult . CASS WORTHING You can do it if you want to . ABBY FANE How ? CASS WORTHING For an hour . No harm in my taking you for a drive in the park . ABBY FANE Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FANE All right . CASS WORTHING My place ? ABBY FANE Yes . CASS WORTHING Date ? ABBY FANE All right . Come on . CASS turns . ABBY starts . MANNY comes in . Hello , Manny , we were just on our way down . CASS WORTHING How are you , Manny ? MANNY WALSH Ok . ABBY FANE Having a good time ? MANNY WALSH Ok . It 's crowded like the Hotsy-Totsy on a Saturday night . CASS WORTHING I see by the papers , Manny , that this time they are going to get you . MANNY WALSH O yeah ! CASS WORTHING Let 's all go down and have a drink . ABBY FANE Let 's . MANNY WALSH Want to talk to you , Abby  --  just a second  --  CASS WORTHING Private ? MANNY WALSH Yeah  --  private . KAY comes in. p. 85 CASS WORTHING These two want to confer , Kay . He puts his arms around her . Let 's get a drink . KATHRYN DEAN I 've been chasing Manny all evening . Please , Abby , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea . KATHRYN DEAN Tragically . Sometimes , Manny , I think you avoid me . MANNY WALSH Quit kiddin ' . ABBY FANE I 'll put in a word for you , Kay . RODERICK wanders in . Hello , Rod ? You at this party ? RODERICK DEAN Yes , are you ? He nods to CASS rather shyly . CASS WORTHING To KAY . Well , if you fail with Manny , join me at the Bar . He goes out . KATHRYN DEAN You might reasonably expect from a man who is practically under chronic indictment , a certain abandon . But not Mr. Walsh . As far as any effect I have on him , he might be a eunuch or something . MANNY WALSH I consider like you 're in the family . I would n't touch anybody in the family . p. 86 KATHRYN DEAN I love you ! RODERICK DEAN Must be awful to be in the underworld . You have to observe such a strict code . KATHRYN DEAN I adore you . MANNY WALSH Besides , you 're not sincere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss you . ABBY FANE You 're too obvious , Kay . Practice reserve . KATHRYN DEAN Oh , I 've tried subtlety too . I just do n't think the spark 's there , that 's all . ABBY FANE Well , if it is n't , there 's nothing to be done . MANNY WALSH Looking at his watch . Say , listen , I have n't got the time to kid . I got a business appointment downtown in half an hour . RODERICK DEAN You have an appointment now ? MANNY WALSH Sure . RODERICK DEAN Why , it 's nearly two . MANNY WALSH I ca n't help that . I got an important conference at three . ABBY FANE Manny does most of his big deals in the early hours . RODERICK DEAN What would n't I give to be in at that meeting . Manny , be a darling and take me along . p. 87 MANNY WALSH Sorry , it 's confidential . KATHRYN DEAN What do they do , do you suppose ? Do they put people on the spot ? Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentimental . ABBY FANE She 's romantic . It 's probably invoices and shipments and things . RODERICK DEAN In that case , why ca n't he take me ? KATHRYN DEAN If he takes anybody , he 'll take me . MANNY WALSH I wo n't take either of you . KATHRYN DEAN There you are ! I tell you it 's next to impossible to become part of Manny 's private life . He is a strong , silent man . MANNY WALSH Can you leave me alone with Abby for a minute ? ABBY FANE Do n't . I 'm afraid he is going to lecture me . I have just a feeling he is going to lecture me . RODERICK DEAN Come on , Kay , help me find Sig . KATHRYN DEAN I saw him . He was urging a blonde . RODERICK DEAN To MANNY . See you before you go . MANNY WALSH Ok . Got nearly an hour yet . p. 88 KATHRYN DEAN Blowing him a kiss . I 'll be in the conservatory  --  under a palm tree  --  waiting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at KAY . No dignity ! ABBY FANE After a moment . You look so solemn , Manny , what 's it about ? MANNY WALSH It 's about that sore head , Worthing  --  ABBY FANE Really ? Why ? What ? When ? How ? MANNY WALSH Do n't stall . You knew that 's what I wanted to talk to you about . And you know damn well what it 's about . ABBY FANE Now , Manny  --  MANNY WALSH Now listen  --  you ca n't kid me . I know what 's going on . ABBY FANE I 'm serious . Tell me what you 're talking about . MANNY WALSH You 're playing around again with Cass Worthing . ABBY FANE Playing around ? What do you mean playing around ? MANNY WALSH What 's he doing here ? ABBY FANE It 's a big party . I ca n't keep him from coming to a party . p. 89 MANNY WALSH You 've been seeing him . Kay told me . Bad ! ABBY FANE Seriously . No , Manny , it is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell of a sweet fellow . ABBY FANE I know it . No one knows it as well as I know it . MANNY WALSH Stubbornly . Then what the hell are you doing messing around with Worthing ? You know what a God-damn run-around he gave you in the old days . ABBY FANE I seem to remember something of the sort . MANNY WALSH He 's one baby you ca n't fool with . You know that , do n't you ? ABBY FANE I 'm better equipped than I used to be . MANNY WALSH My God , do n't tell me you 've fallen for him again ? ABBY FANE What if I have ? What can I do about it if I have ? MANNY WALSH Listen , now let me tell you what 's happened already . It might put you onto the kind of game you 're playing . ABBY FANE What ? MANNY WALSH I 'm downstairs in the Bar drinking . Worthing and that soak Dashiell are propped up against the bar . I noticed Rod and Sigrift in the crush and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MANNY WALSH Dashiell and Worthing were getting confidential like through a megaphone . ABBY FANE What did they say ? MANNY WALSH Dashiell was kidding Worthing about the way his old girl had gone up in the world with a house like this and all . Dashiell says : " Is she high-hatting you now ? Or is she being herself ? " I was going to go over and smash him . And I guess Rod saw it , because he kind of casually steered me out of the room . ABBY rises . Now that 's risky , Abby . ABBY FANE Frightened for an instant . What shall I do ? MANNY WALSH I 'll get Worthing by myself and tell him to get his drunken friend and clear out of here .  --  ABBY FANE No , Manny , I do n't want you to . I can handle Cass myself . MANNY WALSH And I 'm telling you , Abby , you 're foolish  --  you  --  SIGRIFT comes in . HAROLD SIGRIFT Where 's Rod ? ABBY FANE I have n't seen him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you . p. 91 HAROLD SIGRIFT That 's too far off . If you see him tell him I 'm here and will be indefinitely . He plumps down on the chaise longue . ABBY FANE Manny , we 'll continue this in the privacy of the dance floor . HAROLD SIGRIFT The party , thank God , is thinning out . There 's still a busy cluster in the bar , Worthing and Dashiell presiding . A couple of near-notables are crying for you , Abby  --  ABBY FANE I 'm a rotten hostess . Your fault , Manny . Enter Rod . Hello , Rod , you at this party ? RODERICK DEAN Yes , are you ? CASS comes in , flushed , reckless . CASS WORTHING My God , Abby , what are you doing up here ? Come on down . ABBY FANE You go ; I 'll be down in a minute . CASS WORTHING No , come on now let 's dance . ABBY FANE Afraid of what CASS may say . All right , let 's  --  She goes off with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cigar . SIGRIFT lies prone on the chaise longue. p. 92 RODERICK DEAN Well , look at the wax-works . Nevertheless , he rather is touched by silence . He stands , too , smoking a cigarette , listening to the music which swells into the room quite clearly . HAROLD SIGRIFT That music is an invitation to sex  --  RODERICK DEAN More than an invitation  --  practically a command . MANNY WALSH Annoyed at this lucubration . Bluntly . It 's a popular song . They listen a moment longer . RODERICK DEAN Well , Sig , how did you come out with your blonde ? HAROLD SIGRIFT She 's one of those illiterate girls who expects a flowery approach . I did n't feel up to it so I left her with a Saturday Evening Post reader whose success is inevitable . MANNY WALSH My God , you people make too much fuss about sex . Do n't you fellows ever think of anything else ? HAROLD SIGRIFT I think about food a good deal . RODERICK DEAN What do you think about , Manny ? MANNY WALSH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 93 HAROLD SIGRIFT Is n't he elfin ? RODERICK DEAN Enjoying our little party ? HAROLD SIGRIFT What a clatter at dinner ! Opinions . Epigrams . I could hardly digest . I thought to myself ; multiply this clatter a thousand times and you get the overtone of the intelligensia in this Republic . Dear God , must Abby cultivate celebrities . Does n't she know any obscure people ? RODERICK DEAN You 're hard on her , Sig  --  there 's a lot to be said for lion-hunting . Why not ? It 's a kind of education by specialists . After all , it 's better than having the house full of snobs and rich men  --  especially for a girl like Abby . HAROLD SIGRIFT Is it ? RODERICK DEAN I think so . HAROLD SIGRIFT I overheard the psychoanalyst from Vienna talking to Abby  --  on the dance floor , mind you  --  about bed-wetting and thumb-sucking in infants . And Abby seemed interested . A little more of this bits-and-pieces education and Abby will blossom out with an outline of something or other . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RODERICK DEAN I still insist . It 's some kind of intellectual interest . Better than backgammon and gossip . p. 94 HAROLD SIGRIFT Not much . RODERICK DEAN At least  --  it 's understandable . Besides , who 's better ? HAROLD SIGRIFT Nobody . RODERICK DEAN What house that you know is better ? HAROLD SIGRIFT My dear boy , all I 'm saying is that Abby is n't an anomaly . She 's conventional . Out of a night club you might have expected something different . RODERICK DEAN It 's all right for you and me to lie around making generalizations . We 've never had anything to worry about but our states of mind . Abby is different . This sort of thing 's fun for her . Why not ? The extraordinary thing is  --  HAROLD SIGRIFT What ? RODERICK DEAN People like Abbey are so enormously  --  adaptable . Whatever environment she falls into  --  she belongs . In a Night Club . Here . It makes no difference . Whereas I feel like an outsider . Why is that ? HAROLD SIGRIFT Ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessons . Wonderful discovery psycho-analysis ! Makes quite simple people feel they 're complex . Pause . The music again seeps through . SIGRIFT stretches out comfortably on sofa . RODERICK leans on mantle. p. 95 RODERICK DEAN Sig , do n't you get a sense sometimes , especially lately of things disintegrating , crumbling  --  some enormous transition  --  the final flicker of civilization  --  aprs-nous le-dluge  --  HAROLD SIGRIFT My boy , le dluge is here . That mob downstairs is le dluge  --  RODERICK DEAN Is this the end of us ? Are we in at the death ? Rather dramatic . Were people aware when Rome fell that it was about to fall ? Did they get a kick out of it ? HAROLD SIGRIFT No . They just went on wondering what they were having for dinner and who was sleeping with whom  --  their chief preoccupations , I imagine , were gustatory and phallic . RODERICK DEAN Even as you and I ! HAROLD SIGRIFT Even as Adam and Eve . RODERICK DEAN I suppose it 's immature not to be casual about everything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're an eternal type . You search around for an absolute as men used to search for the fountain of youth or a gold-formula . RODERICK DEAN Absolute ! What the devil are we talking about , Sig ? HAROLD SIGRIFT It does n't matter . It 's very pleasant . A moment 's pause. p. 96 RODERICK DEAN Sig  --  HAROLD SIGRIFT Yes , my pet . RODERICK DEAN What really worries me is not the absolute but something less remote . HAROLD SIGRIFT I gather that . Abby and the handsome polo player . RODERICK DEAN Yes . I 'm frightfully jealous . HAROLD SIGRIFT And I think with reason . RODERICK DEAN Why ? Did you see anything ? HAROLD SIGRIFT Only what is obvious ? RODERICK DEAN Do you know anything ? HAROLD SIGRIFT No , I do n't . RODERICK DEAN If you do , tell me . HAROLD SIGRIFT I 've never been accused of reticence . RODERICK DEAN This afternoon after you left we quarreled . HAROLD SIGRIFT I 'll bet you did . RODERICK turns away . I said to myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! RODERICK DEAN There 's a curious ego in love . I knew there was a man in Abby 's life but as long as I did n't know who he was  --  A moment 's pause . I have flares of rage , flares of indignation , but they do n't last . I ca n't keep it up . Is n't it awful ? p. 97 HAROLD SIGRIFT Would you like to assassinate Worthing ? RODERICK DEAN Only momentarily . How does one sustain a hate ? I have moments of lucidity  --  rather awful , when I 'm overcome with a sense of the triviality of this little intrigue  --  Abby 's rather childish conquests  --  that saturnine Worthing employing his moment of eternity , swinging a mallet  --  my own jealousy  --  a brief moment of petulance against the whole background of life  --  all of us lost in it . My indignation vanishes . My hate simmers down . That 's abnormal , is n't it , to feel like that ? What 's the matter with me ? What shall I do ? HAROLD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you  --  you 're Hamlet married to a career woman . RODERICK DEAN I might have known you 'd think the worst of Abby . You never did like her . HAROLD SIGRIFT On the contrary . I 'm secretly in love with her . She 's got that  --  what does that songwriter chap call it  --  oh , yes  --  that thing . She 's one of those women . CASS comes in , MANNY directly behind him . CASS is quite drunk , but he does n't stagger . He is used to holding quantities of liquor . He watches himself , his speech and movements , they are both slow and thick. p. 98 MANNY WALSH He is very genial . Will you gentlemen excuse me ? RODERICK DEAN Certainly . HAROLD SIGRIFT I wo n't get up for anybody . MANNY WALSH I 've got to talk to Worthing . That 's why I got him up here . That 's why I got him out of the Bar . CASS WORTHING What do you want to talk to me about ? MANNY WALSH You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him out . RODERICK DEAN Come on , Sig . HAROLD SIGRIFT In despair . There 's no balm in Gilead . CASS WORTHING You do n't have to go , whatever he 's got to say to me , he can say to me here . HAROLD SIGRIFT Relapsing back , greatly relieved . Cass , you 're a gentleman and a polo player . RODERICK DEAN I 'll go . CASS WORTHING No , you do n't go either . MANNY WALSH If you were n't so drunk , you  --  CASS WORTHING What if I am drunk ? p. 99 RODERICK DEAN Really , Manny  --  MANNY WALSH He 's been saying some foolish things to his friend Dashiell . RODERICK DEAN Why should n't he say foolish things if he wants to ? CASS WORTHING Do n't be so polite  --  You know God damn well you  --  MANNY WALSH You 'd better go Rod . RODERICK DEAN No , I wo n't go . What is all this ? CASS WORTHING I 'll tell you what it is . ABBY comes in . ABBY FANE Everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him  --  I want him to know  --  ABBY FANE Admonishing a child . Now , Cass  --  for heaven 's sake  --  CASS WORTHING You do n't understand  --  I do n't want to be under cover about this  --  I want him to know  --  MANNY WALSH Shut your face ! He advances on CASS threateningly . ABBY FANE Now , Manny , for heaven 's sake , do n't go defending my honor . p. 100 CASS WORTHING Turning to ROD . You might as well know  --  Abby and I were lovers once and  --  we are again . MANNY gives him a terrific blow in the face . CASS staggers and falls . ABBY FANE Manny ! HAROLD SIGRIFT Pleasantly , without moving . Is he dead ? MANNY WALSH No such luck ! But that kisser of his wo n't be so handsome in the morning . CASS gets to his feet . Maybe you want a little more ! RODERICK DEAN Really , Manny  --  ! MANNY WALSH If you had any guts , you 'd have done it yourself . RODERICK DEAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ABBY FANE Cass ! Tell Rod that what you said just now is a lie ! CASS WORTHING What 's the difference ? We 've got a date tonight have n't we ? ABBY FANE Yes , but  --  RODERICK DEAN Why do n't you keep it ? ABBY FANE Generous ! But I 'm not going . Never had any intention of going . p. 101 CASS WORTHING Never ! Just a little while ago , you said  --  ABBY FANE Think , Cass , of the number of dates you broke with me  --  in the good old days  --  ! CASS WORTHING But this is different  --  this  --  ! ABBY FANE Sorry , ca n't be done . This is good-by . CASS WORTHING Dazed . I 'll be waiting at my place . CASS goes out . There is a silence . HAROLD SIGRIFT No more music . Guess the party is over . You remember the days when the last waltz was " Good Night Ladies " ? That was based on an altogether different assumption . MANNY WALSH Stupidly looking at his watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed chivalry to interfere with business , Manny . MANNY WALSH To ABBY . Call you up to-morrow . ABBY FANE Do n't forget . MANNY WALSH I wo n't . Night , folks . He goes out . HAROLD SIGRIFT There 's a feller for whom life is simple . What a soldier he would have made . p. 102 ABBY FANE He did . Do n't you know Manny 's war record ? Get up , Sig  --  I want to lie down . I feel tired all of a sudden . HAROLD SIGRIFT Getting up laboriously . You ! Tired ! You 're a gyroscope of vitality . ABBY FANE She is slightly hysterical . Well it was  --  except for a few minor mishaps  --  a successful party ! HAROLD SIGRIFT Did Dr. Leopold Vick have a good time ? ABBY FANE Perhaps not as good as he expected . She does n't feel ready quite to be left alone with ROD yet . Do n't go , Sig , let 's chat . HAROLD SIGRIFT There is n't a comfortable chair in the room except the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . They cling to the privileges of a sex they have abandoned . RODERICK DEAN What are you doing to-morrow , Sig ? HAROLD SIGRIFT To-morrow I expect to relax . Call me up  --  not too early . Good night children . Bless you . He goes out . There is a pause . ABBY FANE Does Sig dislike me ? p. 103 RODERICK DEAN He adores you . ABBY FANE No , I 'm serious . I 'm crazy about Sig . I 'd like him to like me . RODERICK DEAN We were talking about you . He said he was in love with you . He said you were one of those women . ABBY FANE One of which women ? RODERICK DEAN He did n't specify . ABBY FANE He says awful things to me all the time .  --  I do n't think he respects me . RODERICK DEAN My dear , do n't tell me you want to be respected  --  at two o'clock in the morning . ABBY FANE Yes , darling , even at two o'clock in the morning . RODERICK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dog contemplating a meaty bone . ABBY FANE Smiling appreciatively . That 's very good . How clever Sig is ! A pause again . He ca n't say anything . She keeps up . It was really a very nice party , Rod , you should have come . RODERICK DEAN I meant to . I was unfortunately delayed . ABBY FANE You and Sig so superior sitting around up here talking . What were you talking about ? p. 104 RODERICK DEAN Oh  --  life . ABBY FANE No use in that . Waste of time . You 'd have been better off downstairs , drinking or dancing or flirting . RODERICK DEAN How liberal you are ! A moment 's pause . ABBY FANE I had one illusion shattered to-night . RODERICK DEAN Did n't know you had an illusion . ABBY FANE Well , I 'm not altogether  --  With a sigh . Heigh-ho ! Life is amusing ! Revenge is sweet ! RODERICK DEAN Is all well that ends well ? ABBY FANE Yes and there 's a cloud to every  --  I mean the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RODERICK DEAN Why do n't you keep your engagement ? ABBY FANE Would you believe it , Rod , that I used to think Cass Worthing was mysterious ? Honest , I did . I used to look at him  --  I used to study that face  --  that handsome , impenetrable , regulation face , I used to say to myself : My God , what 's going on ? What 's he thinking ? Have I displeased him ? Is he angry ? He gave me the run-around and I stood for it . When I think what I stood for . Well , now the tables are turned . I 'm giving him the run-around . God , it 's wonderful ! p. 105 RODERICK DEAN Why do n't you keep your engagement ? ABBY FANE No , thanks . I told you  --  I never meant to . RODERICK DEAN Your operations are too involved for me . ABBY FANE He used to make engagements with me  --  and break them . That was a favorite trick of his . I was a poor kid from Pittsburgh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cass Worthing , handsome , rich , everything . He would call me at six and ask me to wait for him at dinner . Well , I 'd wait till six , seven , eight , nine , ten  --  till it was time to go to the club . Did n't dare to go out to eat for fear I 'd miss him . One night I fainted . Simple starvation . First love . That beautiful first love ! RODERICK DEAN This is nothing then but an exercise in revenge ? ABBY FANE Nothing else but ! If I were going to deceive you it would n't be with Cass Worthing . RODERICK DEAN Kisses  --  embraces  --  dates at three o'clock in the morning  --  just an elaborate  --  you 're quite medieval , are n't you ? ABBY FANE Is that the way they were ? Do n't tell me I 'm old fashioned  --  RODERICK DEAN Whatever he was once , he 's in love with you now  --  I could tell it just now . And you 're in love with him  --  otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't I ? Gosh , Rod , how different we are ! RODERICK DEAN Yes , Abby , I am slowly coming to the conclusion that we are slightly incompatible . How long did this affair last ? ABBY FANE Two years . RODERICK DEAN Why did it end ? ABBY FANE He got sick of breaking dates with me . Fed up . Took up with some one else . Would n't see me . RODERICK DEAN That , I suppose , is the interlude in which you married me . I owe your acquiescence to Worthing 's fatigue . Now , he seems to have recovered  --  ABBY FANE No , it 's I who have recovered . Listen , Rod , let me tell you ,  --  RODERICK DEAN You 've become a psychologist . You have technical conversations with Dr. Vick . Do n't you suspect the true motive of this elaborate revenge ? ABBY FANE Say , what are you trying to  --  do n't go putting ideas into my head , Rod . A moment 's pause . I do n't see why you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEAN It 's just not worth it ! ABBY FANE Now , Rod , you ca n't talk like that till you 've heard me through . I had n't seen Cass in two years . I ran into him at the Ritz one day when I was having lunch with your sister . I saw him give me the once over  --  I had to laugh to myself . His look was so  --  transparent . Not bad , it said . Might be worth taking on again , it said . Might be fun , in fact , it said . Well , Rod , I ca n't tell you how I felt when I saw that look  --  a kind of triumph . It was marvelous ! I felt so strong , so easy  --  so equipped to handle him . It was grand . It was like heady wine . No matter what you say it was revenge and it was sweeter than sweet  --  well , I 've been putting him through it . Not what he made me go through , because he has n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't in love  --  just wants me  --  although you know , just now , when he went out  --  I felt he was rather touched  --  I felt rather sorry for him . p. 107 RODERICK DEAN Oh , I 'm pretty sure that your hatred is tempered by sympathy . ABBY FANE Say , what are you trying to do anyway ? You 're making something out of nothing  --  RODERICK DEAN I think it would be honest to establish your integrity in one respect , at least  --  and keep your engagement . ABBY FANE God , how jealous you are ! RODERICK DEAN You have the happy faculty of bringing out the worst in me  --  this pretense of insincerity with Worthing is the most profound confession . You think it exonerates you ? ABBY FANE Am I on trial ? RODERICK DEAN It 's part of everything else  --  this fake household , this imitation culture , this lion hunting , this second rate intrigue . This story does n't convince me , even if it does convince you . Is it necessary to flirt with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play an elaborate game with him too ? Of course , that 's absurd . If what I had to offer you was enough , you would n't have the time for this kind of childish intrigue . Evidently it is n't . Well , I 'm sorry . It did n't work out . Well , that 's that . ABBY FANE Rod , I swear to you I was just playing a game with Cass  --  perhaps I should n't . I 'm terribly sorry . p. 108 RODERICK DEAN I appreciate your trying to spare my feelings . Well , you need n't spare them . Perhaps I 'm less sensitive than you think . ABBY FANE Really touched by this . Rod , I 'm terribly sorry  --  I ca n't say any more . RODERICK DEAN No , it 's vulgar and stupid , the whole thing  --  I 'm fed up with it  --  thoroughly . I 'm not interested . Pause . ABBY FANE Are you dismissing me ? RODERICK DEAN I 'm making it possible for you to express yourself , There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there never was . ABBY FANE Suddenly cold with deadly calm . All right ! What do you want me to do ? RODERICK DEAN Cold too . I want you not to spare my feelings ! I want you to keep your engagement with Worthing . ABBY FANE Seeing through him . What a capacity you have for torturing yourself . RODERICK DEAN You told me once you were a mimic at heart . You seem to be able to imitate anything except honesty . ABBY FANE Losing her own temper and flinging about . Oh , do n't be so damn superior . Honesty ! Honesty ! What does it mean ? p. 109 RODERICK DEAN I 'm not surprised that you ask . ABBY FANE It 's easy for you to be honest  --  you do n't want anything , and what you want you have . RODERICK DEAN I 'm afraid , Abby , that you 're superficial . There is very little that I want , that I have . ABBY FANE That 's a pose . RODERICK DEAN Very well . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plaster saint . I 'm a human being . When I married you I did n't promise to sit in the corner and twiddle my thumbs . RODERICK DEAN If we 're not careful this will degenerate into a vulgar quarrel . ABBY FANE Well , God damn it , I 'll be vulgar if I feel like it . I tell you , the trouble with you  --  if you had any guts  --  Manny was right  --  if you had any guts  --  if you gave a damn about me  --  when Cass said what he did you 'd have laid him out  --  RODERICK DEAN Well , you see , I 'm cold . I 'm heartless . I 'm not an emotional type like Manny  --  or yourself  --  I do n't lay people out . I do n't think it solves any problems . ABBY FANE Oh I 'm sick of hearing about your problems . You 've never been up against a real problem in your life . You 're just a self-centered weakling , lying around and dribbling , while other people work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anyway ? What the hell do you stand for ? Anybody can go around picking out flaws in things if they 've got nothing else to worry about ! Why , it 's like living with a hypochondriac telling you about his ailments all the time ! The truth is  --  you 're damn ineffectual and you take it out on me because I 'm not . p. 110 RODERICK DEAN Well , Cass Worthing meets your requirements , does n't he ? Why do n't you go to him ? ABBY FANE If you say that again I will go to him . RODERICK DEAN Why do n't you ? He 's waiting . ABBY FANE Do you mean that ? RODERICK DEAN Yes ! At best your fidelity is only technical . ABBY FANE You 'll let me ? RODERICK DEAN I urge you . ABBY FANE Very well . I will ! Why not ? And that will be that ! She flings out . He stands rigid holding himself in . He wants to run after her , to beg her to come back , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is aware of the vast and painful discrepancy between his attitude and his instinct . He laughs mirthlessly . RODERICK DEAN To himself. @x SCENE : The same . TIME : About midnight  --  three weeks later . AT RISE : The stage is empty . RODERICK and SIGRIFT enter . They are in evening dress . SIG carries several copies of tabloid newspapers which he has picked up on the way home from a dinner-party where they have been very bored . ROD turns on the lights . SIG makes for the chaise longue and flops on it . Solemnly and meticulously , ROD measures out two whiskeys and sodas , gives SIG one and takes one himself . They drink without saying a word . SIG buries himself in the newspapers . HAROLD SIGRIFT Direct to sofa . You and Abby are n't front page stuff any more , Rod . RODERICK DEAN Well , that 's a relief . HAROLD SIGRIFT Finds an item , happily . Yes ! Buried inside . " Pent house Papa tells it to Judge . " Ah ! One good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tribune to the Tabloids . The flair of these gentlemen . One of them hints that Abby had more than a fancy for the butler . Another , that you had a penchant for going to Harlem . RODERICK DEAN Do n't you ever get tired of reading those damn things ? p. 112 HAROLD SIGRIFT And did you see that handsome photograph of Abby 's deserted bedroom ? And the caption was : " Fouled Nest . " I pasted that one in my memory book . ROD starts playing one of Debussey 's Submarine Studies . I hate that shapeless music . Play Bach ! RODERICK DEAN I ca n't play Bach . HAROLD SIGRIFT Modern composers have n't any ideas . They have only moods . RODERICK DEAN What 's the matter with moods ? HAROLD SIGRIFT You get sick of them . RODERICK DEAN You do ! He makes an irritated run over the keys and quits the piano . God , what an evening ! HAROLD SIGRIFT I 'll say this for Abby 's dinner-parties  --  they were n't stuffy . RODERICK DEAN The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same half-wits HAROLD SIGRIFT I know but when Abby assembled them , it all had the air of a circus . It was festive  --  Oh , I know I used to complain , but I could n't help enjoying it because she enjoyed it . Abby  --  a curious name for her to have had  --  that nun-like creature . Now admit , do n't you miss her ? p. 113 RODERICK DEAN Do you ? HAROLD SIGRIFT She was omnivorous and , being myself a kind of glutton , I felt a kinship for her . Also she was not repulsive to the eye . RODERICK DEAN She had a fascinating gesture . HAROLD SIGRIFT You do n't say ! RODERICK DEAN She used to whistle  --  a sort of long , soft whistle and then she would waft away  --  like this  --  He imitates. whatever it was . HAROLD SIGRIFT Did that dissipate the vapors ? RODERICK DEAN It did . It invariably did . HAROLD SIGRIFT Evidently she could n't whistle away Cass Worthing . Pause . Do you still believe that Abby really committed what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? RODERICK DEAN I do n't know . But what I could n't get over was the fact that she had ever belonged so completely to Worthing . I took a high line . I struck an attitude . Who the hell am I to strike an attitude ? To-morrow , I may be on a dole from a Communist Government . Attitudes were all right when life was stratified into castes and codes  --  but all that 's practical these days is a kind of opportunism . p. 114 HAROLD SIGRIFT By beamish boy  --  you said something . Certitude went out with equestrian statuary . A moment . Am I to conclude then that you are prepared to kill the fatted calf for Abby ? RODERICK DEAN No , that 's all over . I have other plans for myself . HAROLD SIGRIFT I 've noticed something slyly triumphant about you lately . What 's been going on in that pellucid mind of yours ? RODERICK DEAN Not ready to tell you yet , Sig . HAROLD SIGRIFT You 're afraid ! RODERICK DEAN Smiling . Perhaps HAROLD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are you planning to do ? Regenerate the human race ? Put bath-tubs in the slums , go over Niagara in a barrel ? Something absurdly altruistic I 'll be bound . Your final disillusion will come when you discover that the human race has a stubborn prejudice against being saved . It is its healthiest obsession . RODERICK DEAN I am concerned solely with saving myself . Measure of desperation . HAROLD SIGRIFT Where are you off to ? Russia I suppose p. 115 RODERICK DEAN Want to come with me ? HAROLD SIGRIFT I ca n't unfortunately . I am leaving at six tomorrow morning for the Uganda to hunt big game . Sadly . Oh , Rod , Rod , why must you marry night-club coloraturi ? Why must you crusade ? Why ca n't you have fun ? RODERICK DEAN I 've been having fun all my life and it 's so deadly monotonous  --  so deadly dull . BUTLER comes in . BUTLER Mr. Walsh . RODERICK DEAN What does he want , I wonder ? HAROLD SIGRIFT He probably wants to borrow a book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . HAROLD SIGRIFT I 'm delighted . If there 's anybody who entertains me , it 's Manny . A clear personality in a world of shadows . MANNY comes in . He is in a forbidding mood and not pleased to see SIGRIFT . RODERICK DEAN Hello Manny . MANNY WALSH Greetings . Churlish  --  to SIG . I think you 'd better blow . p. 116 HAROLD SIGRIFT Blow ? RODERICK DEAN A verb  --  meaning to depart without formality . HAROLD SIGRIFT The one human being I adore and he dismisses me ! MANNY WALSH I ca n't talk serious with him in the room . RODERICK DEAN Shut up Sig HAROLD SIGRIFT Nothing remains for me but to take a nap He turns over on one side , buries his face in the pillows and actually begins to doze . RODERICK DEAN Now then , Manny , what 's worrying you ? MANNY WALSH Plenty . RODERICK DEAN Well , what is it ? MANNY WALSH What are you going to do about Abby ? You know things ca n't go on the way they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abby running around like a chicken with her head cut off  --  Now let me tell you something  --  you got Abby wrong  --  this idea you have about she and Worthing is the bunk RODERICK DEAN I have n't any idea MANNY WALSH Why do n't you snap out of it then ? p. 117 RODERICK DEAN I have snapped out of it . MANNY WALSH Meaning what RODERICK DEAN We 've got to be divorced . MANNY WALSH Well , if you do n't believe this about Worthing RODERICK DEAN There are other reasons . MANNY WALSH What reason ? RODERICK DEAN Let us say , loosely , incompatibility MANNY WALSH You gonner take steps ? RODERICK DEAN What does one usually do ? HAROLD SIGRIFT From his slumber . Register in a hotel with a woman . MANNY WALSH Say , we ought to talk this over by ourselves . RODERICK DEAN Sig knows all about this sort of thing  --  he 's been divorced twice . Shall I get a lawyer ? I 'll do anything Abby suggests . HAROLD SIGRIFT God , what a baby ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SIGRIFT As I say one way is to be surprised in a hotel with a woman . That happened to me twice  --  once by arrangement . p. 118 RODERICK DEAN I wo n't have to go to Reno , will I ? MANNY WALSH Absorbed . No  --  ca n't be done that way RODERICK DEAN Why not ? HAROLD SIGRIFT Because , my lamb of God , that looks as if the woman had committed adultery , and you were divorcing her . Occasionally it reflects the truth . MANNY WALSH Tell him to shut his trap or I 'll . HAROLD SIGRIFT It was only a simple generalization MANNY WALSH If he makes another crack like that I 'll punch his head HAROLD SIGRIFT Very well . From now on I shall make only the most neutral observations . But let me tell you this , Manny  --  you run the risk of leaving untasted the full flavor of my mind MANNY WALSH The hell with your mind ! Do n't talk out of turn . HAROLD SIGRIFT In that case I 'll resume my 40 winks He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did before . MANNY WALSH You 're all set to get a divorce then ? p. 119 RODERICK DEAN Yes . MANNY WALSH Sure ? RODERICK DEAN Positive . MANNY WALSH O.K. You wo n't mind then if I RODERICK DEAN What ? MANNY WALSH Well , you know how I feel about Abby . I 'm going to take it up with her again but I did n't want to do it until  --  well  --  I did n't want to be courtin ' the wife of a friend . HAROLD SIGRIFT Out of his slumber . I love him . MANNY WALSH Turns to him . You shut up or I 'll really put you to sleep . HAROLD SIGRIFT I ca n't help it if I love you . MANNY WALSH You have to admit if she 'd married me instead of you , she 'd have been a damn sight better off . RODERICK DEAN What about Worthing ? From what I hear you 'll have to cope with him . MANNY WALSH I 'll take care of Worthing . HAROLD SIGRIFT So nice for Cass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious  --  but I 'm interested naturally . Even assuming you dispose of Worthing  --  what about Abby ? Did n't you tell me once that she , mistakenly of course , would n't marry you because p. 120 MANNY WALSH Well , at that time  --  well , she did n't know her own mind then . I think I can convince her marrying Worthing would be as big a mistake as marrying you . Besides , I 'm in a different position now . RODERICK DEAN How do you mean ? MANNY WALSH Confidentially . You see up to now I 've been so tied down to business  --  I ai n't had much time to develop myself in other ways . But I 'm going to take things easier from now on . Gonner read a lot and you know get kind of HAROLD SIGRIFT When you marry Abby , my wedding present will be the Five Foot Shelf . MANNY WALSH I 've got it . HAROLD SIGRIFT Well , then an ooze leather set of Bruce Barton . The man nobody reads . MANNY WALSH Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books yesterday . RODERICK DEAN Then you and Worthing fight it out between you and may the best man win . MANNY WALSH Starting out . Do n't worry . I will . HAROLD SIGRIFT I adore that man . MANNY WALSH How the hell can you adore a man unless  --  you know what I mean . p. 121 HAROLD SIGRIFT Farewell Puck . MANNY and ROD go out . SIG is left lying alone . ABBY appears in the doorway  --  looks around the room . Sees SIG , who does n't see her . She walks in quietly , stands looking at him . ABBY FANE Hello , Sig HAROLD SIGRIFT Greatly surprised . My God , no privacy ! ABBY FANE Going center . How are you , Sig ? Could n't imagine this room without you lying in it . Tell me honestly have you been off that sofa since . You have n't stirred , have you ? HAROLD SIGRIFT I 've changed sides once or twice . How 'd you get in without ? ABBY FANE I still have my key . HAROLD SIGRIFT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Manny go downstairs . I stopped in my room a second  --  there it was . HAROLD SIGRIFT Rod is keeping it as a shrine ABBY FANE Steps to him . Same old Sig ! She slaps him with her long glove. p. 122 HAROLD SIGRIFT With dignity . No flagellation please . ABBY FANE Laughing at him . Oh , Sig , why am I so fond of you ? HAROLD SIGRIFT Can it be love ? ABBY FANE Ca n't tell . Love does funny things . HAROLD SIGRIFT Your small talk still drips originality . In fact the tinkle of your platitudes recalls the past with an almost lyric nostalgia . ABBY FANE It is the past , is n't it ? It 's only a few weeks ago , but it 's a far past . HAROLD SIGRIFT Do n't be phoney , dear . ABBY FANE I 'm not . No , sir . HAROLD SIGRIFT Abby , I sometimes wonder if you know where mimicry ends and sincerity begins ? ABBY FANE Not always . But I do n't think anybody knows  --  always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncertainties  --  and half truths  --  the charm and the pain too . HAROLD SIGRIFT Why , Abby , you 're ageing . ABBY FANE You 're right  --  I 'm ageing . A moment . How 's Rod ? p. 123 HAROLD SIGRIFT Oh  --  Rod  --  he 's gone into a messianic catalepsy  --  ABBY FANE A new one on her . What ? HAROLD SIGRIFT Brushing her away from ROD . Hear you 're getting married again . ABBY FANE You know all the gossip , do n't you , Sig ? HAROLD SIGRIFT This time I contgratulate you . Worthing is perfect for you . ABBY FANE Think so ? HAROLD SIGRIFT You 'll be able to deceive him with impunity . ABBY FANE From that point of view the perfect person would be you . HAROLD SIGRIFT These hints will avail you naught . ABBY FANE You know , Sig , in spite of all your wisdom , I imagine you were awfully stupid with your wives . HAROLD SIGRIFT They were stupid with me . Success was within their grasp .  --  But they bungled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have no sympathy with failure . ABBY FANE Stretches herself , sits down luxuriously . Nice to be in this house again ! Hotel rooms ! Those genteel , green-tinted walls  --  those discreet decorators ' furnishings  --  You see a little man mincing around furnishing a model suite and you 're paying eighteen dollars a day for one of a thousand duplications . Can you imagine ? When I came to New York first I 'd have thought that suite I was in now was Heaven . What the devil I acquired taste for I do n't know . No earthly good to me . p. 124 HAROLD SIGRIFT Well , if it 's no good to you . ROD comes in Their eyes meet  --  he is amazed to see ABBY . ABBY FANE Hello ! HAROLD SIGRIFT To ROD . Do you know Mrs. Deane ? RODERICK DEAN Hello ! HAROLD SIGRIFT It 's high time you two met . Mrs. Deane was just deploring the acquisition of taste . I was about to tell her it would n't bother her long . There 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notions whose upkeep is painful . RODERICK DEAN I 've been discarding a good deal of ballast myself lately There is a silence . HAROLD SIGRIFT Finally . Can it be that we are at a loss ? Say something Abby . ABBY FANE Suggest a topic . HAROLD SIGRIFT Tell us your early experiences . You must have had an interesting life . ABBY FANE Meeting SIG on his own ground . Oh , yes ! I ran the gamut from rags to riches  --  I had my moment of glory  --  and now  --  I 'm a Sunday supplement heroine . As matter of fact one of the papers is actually pestering me to write my biography . p. 125 HAROLD SIGRIFT Pleading . Put me in it , Abby . ABBY FANE Certainly  --  Chapter Four  --  First Love  --  I meet Harold Sigrift  --  HAROLD SIGRIFT This , Rod , is where I become immortal . After a moment . RODERICK DEAN It just occurred to me  --  it 's the last time probably we 'll ever be in this room together  --  the three of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm giving up this apartment . ABBY FANE Really shocked . Really ! RODERICK DEAN Yes . Part of the ballast . HAROLD SIGRIFT Rod 'll end in some monastery in Tibet wearing a hair-shirt and moodily contemplating his navel . Pause . Well , I think I 'll blow . He lumbers up . ABBY rises . ROD rises . Now , Abby , no matter whom you marry , I hope you 'll ask me to dine occasionally . It 'll be good for you to have a simple , obscure , non-publicized person like myself once in a while for contrast . p. 126 ABBY FANE What a meanie you are ! HAROLD SIGRIFT As he crosses to door . You ca n't be a dream princess to everybody . RODERICK DEAN Lunch to-morrow ? HAROLD SIGRIFT With MANNY 'S voice and gesture . O.K. ABBY FANE Sig , if Rod goes to Tibet , will you call me up sometimes ? HAROLD SIGRIFT What ! That old mad game over again ! I could n't stand it ! He goes out . They laugh . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a silence . ABBY FANE Finally . Glad to see me ? RODERICK DEAN Of course . ABBY FANE Have you really given up this apartment ? RODERICK DEAN Yes . ABBY FANE Rod  --  come here  --  sit beside me  --  He does . What 've you been doing ? RODERICK DEAN Below her . Thinking . ABBY FANE Anything else ? p. 127 RODERICK DEAN I 've been getting over being sensitive . What with surtax and one thing and another , I ca n't afford luxuries like that . ABBY FANE If I 'd been sensitive , I 'd been dead long ago . RODERICK DEAN What are you doing here now ? ABBY FANE Well , I was going to supper with Cass and I suddenly decided that  --  I think I 've done a mad thing , Rod . RODERICK DEAN What ? ABBY FANE I promised to marry Cass Worthing . RODERICK DEAN Good idea . ABBY FANE Oh , you think so , do you ? RODERICK DEAN Yes . I think so . ABBY FANE Well , I 'm glad we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be quite perfect for you . ABBY FANE Because he 'll set me up in the style to which I 've been accustomed . Rod  --  you 've ruined me . You know that  --  you 've ruined me . You and Sig both  --  you 've been bad for me . RODERICK DEAN How ? ABBY FANE I do n't know . You 've made me dissatisfied and unsure . You 've made me suspect myself . A moment , she goes on . Things do n't seem to me any more  --  quite good enough . Before you , that never occurred to me . Bad ! The night clubs , the town , the people I meet  --  second-ratish.  --  Something brushed off them  --  all of them . Is it age ? Is it disillusion ? What is it ? It upsets me  --  I used to think I was pretty good  --  you know that , I guess  --  I used to think everything was pretty grand . I was healthy  --  had an aptitude for conquest . Not now  --  not any more . Bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done it . You should have let me be . Sore at you ! p. 128 RODERICK DEAN My dear Abby , I refuse to feel contrition . If you 've come out of this worse than I have  --  well , that 's the chance you took . Why should you be assured against all disaster ? ABBY FANE How hard you 've become ! RODERICK DEAN It 's absurd  --  your feeling sorry for yourself . I certainly sha n't feel sorry for you . If any one deserves pity , it 's Cass whom you 'll probably marry as you married me as a last resource . ABBY FANE You 're not nice any more . I do n't like you any more . RODERICK DEAN I 'm sorry ! ABBY FANE Roderick Deane , what 's come over you ? RODERICK DEAN Rises , goes away from her . Maturity . ABBY FANE I liked you better when you were adolescent . RODERICK DEAN Like hell you did . You married me for your own purposes  --  without loving me  --  and then you walked all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Light it for me , will you ? He does . You know I feel as if I had never left this room . What 's happened these four weeks ? I do n't know . You were right , I guess . I 'm just a cat . I can curl up anywhere and go to sleep . p. 129 RODERICK DEAN Yes , anywhere . Hands her cigarette . ABBY FANE You 're changed  --  you 're so changed ! RODERICK DEAN Am I ? ABBY FANE Do n't recognize you . RODERICK DEAN About time , do n't you think ABBY FANE Here you 're going abroad RODERICK DEAN Yes . ABBY FANE What are you going to do ? RODERICK DEAN Experiment . ABBY FANE Rou . RODERICK DEAN Oh , not in that way . You are my last experiment  --  in that way . ABBY FANE Am I ? RODERICK DEAN I 'm going to Russia . ABBY FANE What are you going to do there , anyway ? RODERICK DEAN Do n't know . I may settle down there and work for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . Take me with you . RODERICK DEAN No. p. 130 ABBY FANE Why not ? RODERICK DEAN I 'm not traveling de luxe . ABBY FANE Should n't mind . I 'd like it . RODERICK DEAN No , you would n't . Bad hotels . Bad food . ABBY FANE I do n't think you 'll like it , either . Have you seen the pictures of those Russian peasant women in the papers ? Not so hot . Better take me . RODERICK DEAN Moves away from her . Sorry . Ca n't . ABBY FANE God , you 're unapproachable . RODERICK DEAN Ca n't wear your heart on your sleeve  --  Sits away from her on love seat.  --  too vulnerable there . ABBY follows him , stands before him . She senses fear in this retreat  --  it emboldens her . ABBY FANE Ca n't you say something nice to me ? You know you could win me over if you used the right method . All I want is wooing  --  just a little skillful wooing and I 'm yours . RODERICK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know you 'll never have the fun with anybody you had with me. p. 131 RODERICK DEAN Some truth in that . ABBY FANE Well then . RODERICK DEAN I had to pay too heavily for the fun I had with you . Do you know why our marriage was a failure ? ABBY sits in front of him on stool . Because it was based on a false assumption , that one can derive from some one else a strength that one has n't oneself . It ca n't be done . In our marriage I became an adjunct to you , because you had the vitality to go after what you wanted and I did n't . ABBY FANE What do you want ? RODERICK DEAN I want  --  ABBY FANE What ? RODERICK DEAN If you must know , I 'm sick of my life , heartily sick of it . It is n't my own life at all , it 's a carbon copy of hundreds of other parasitic lives around me . I want to discover my place in the world . ABBY FANE Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a necessary first step  --  a stimulus to future endeavor , I 've given up all my money  --  ABBY FANE You 've done what ? RODERICK DEAN I 've left myself barely enough to live on . Not too comfortably at that . p. 132 ABBY FANE Who did you give the money to ? RODERICK DEAN That was amusing . Having decided to give away this considerable fortune , I found that I was n't equipped even to be generous . I finally had to give it to a group of specialists who will decide what to do with it . It was my first contact with the contemporary world . ABBY FANE A group of specialists ! Rod , Rod ! If you had been as poor as I have been , if you knew how hard money is to get  --  as I do  --  RODERICK DEAN I never earned a penny of it . I never had any fun out of it . ABBY FANE Always the realist . Well , your father will leave you a lot , so I guess that will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I come to it . People will say I 'm eccentric . ABBY FANE Cuckoo ! RODERICK DEAN As you so charmingly call it  --  cuckoo ! What of it ? What does it matter compared to the fact that to-morrow I walk out of here for the first time in my life  --  a free man  --  ABBY FANE Free ? RODERICK DEAN Yes . Miraculously free , Abby . I ca n't tell you  --  p. 133 ABBY FANE Free of me I suppose . RODERICK DEAN Of all sorts of encumbrances . ABBY FANE Thank you . RODERICK DEAN Sorry , Abby , but that 's what I 'm going to do . And I 'm going to do it alone . There is no mistaking the finality of his tone . She feels suddenly and completely devastated . ABBY FANE That means then that you and I are really  --  washed up ? RODERICK DEAN It took me a month of struggle to come clear of you  --  of myself . ABBY FANE It 's funny  --  RODERICK DEAN Suddenly  --  I grew up  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought we were nearer each other than ever  --  we 're not . You 're so far away , I ca n't reach you . For the first time I believe in the reality of our separation , and it dries me up . Well , it 's a blow , Mr. Deane , but I guess I can still take it . Enter BUTLER . BUTLER Surprised to see her . Oh , Mrs. Deane ! ABBY FANE Good evening , Trent . p. 134 BUTLER Mr. Worthing is asking for you . ABBY FANE On the phone ? BUTLER No , he 's downstairs . ABBY FANE Shall I ? RODERICK DEAN Why not ? ABBY FANE Ask him to come up . Exit BUTLER . Can you imagine Cass  --  after the note I left him  --  RODERICK DEAN He 's probably come to take you to the party . ABBY FANE I 'm just in the mood for a party ! RODERICK DEAN Annoyed with himself for displaying anger . Do n't put on an act , Abby . You 'll probably go , and have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good-by . ABBY FANE No , Rod  --  No . Not good-by . ROD exits . CASS enters . CASS WORTHING I found your note . What does it mean ? ABBY FANE Is n't it clear ? CASS WORTHING No , Abby . I do n't understand . What have I done ? I thought everything was settled . ABBY FANE What 's the use ? p. 135 CASS WORTHING When I phoned you this afternoon there was n't a hint you were gay and  --  just the same  --  keen about going to this party at the Casino  --  ABBY FANE Better drop me Cass . More trouble than I 'm worth . CASS WORTHING What kind of a person are you ? Have n't you any code at all ? ABBY FANE Code ? Is that what you said ? CASS WORTHING Yes . That 's what I said . ABBY FANE Well , that 's a high sounding word . That 's something you began to observe after Rod married me  --  CASS WORTHING I asked you to marry me . Is n't that  --  ABBY FANE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abby , you 've gone solemn . What you need is a drink and a few laughs . Now you come along to the Casino . ABBY FANE Oh , dear , if there 's one emotion the pleasure of which is exaggerated  --  it 's revenge . I used to think you were God , Cass . CASS WORTHING I was rotten to you , Abby . But now it 's different . Ca n't you see that ? You can make a doormat of me if you want to  --  only  --  Abby I want to do things for you  --  make up to you  --  I want to get you out of all this  --  teach you to ride and shoot  --  all the things you 've missed all your life . p. 136 ABBY FANE Too late for that now , Cass . CASS WORTHING Why ? Why ? ABBY FANE I want something else . CASS WORTHING What 's happened to you ? ABBY FANE I 'm in love . CASS WORTHING In love ? In love with whom ? She says nothing , walks away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked you , did n't I  --  if you were ever going back to Deane ? You said " No , " did n't you ? You said you wanted a divorce , did n't you ? ABBY FANE Yes  --  I did  --  CASS WORTHING Then what the  --  ABBY FANE It 's funny how your mind can go along two lines at the same time  --  what do you call it  --  parallel ? Remember when you asked me to marry you ? I said " Yes . " And at the same time I was thinking  --  " Rod 'll hear about this and come through . " Now you 've got it , Cass  --  the low-down on me . CASS WORTHING Well , we 're quits then are n't we ? I put you through it  --  admitted  --  you 've done the same to me  --  plenty . Well , let 's start again . ABBY FANE No , Cass . A pause . The same thing again  --  do n't you see ? The same thing over again . Must n't  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Give me up , Cass. p. 137 CASS WORTHING I ca n't after what we 've been to each other . ABBY FANE Do n't say that again to me . I 'm fed up . I 'm fed up . CASS WORTHING They 're waiting for us at the Casino . I do n't suppose you 'd care to come now . ABBY FANE No , I 'm afraid not . CASS WORTHING I think it 's rotten bad taste to spoil a party at the eleventh hour . It wo n't be so easy to replace you . ABBY FANE That did n't use to bother you . Why do n't you look up some of your old numbers ? CASS WORTHING Not a bad idea . What this means is that I 've got to go way over to East 60th to get my address book . He goes out . ABBY , left alone , reconnoiters in her mind  --  She feels suddenly gay . She opens door and calls off . ABBY FANE Rod ! Rod ! I 'm just going . RODERICK DEAN Entering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RODERICK DEAN Why did n't you go with him ? ABBY FANE Oh , Rod , are other people 's lives so complicated , or is it just me ? p. 138 RODERICK DEAN You love complications . Do n't pretend . What have you done now ? ABBY FANE For once I told the absolute truth , and oh , merciful creator , what a sensation ! RODERICK DEAN What did you say to him ? ABBY FANE I gave him , as they say , the air . But he had the last word though  --  thank God for that . RODERICK DEAN Poor Cass . ABBY FANE I know him pretty well  --  he 'll recover quickly . In a week he 'll be telling himself that he 's well out of it  --  that he let me down easy . RODERICK DEAN Yes , and you 'll be telephoning him to-morrow . ABBY FANE No  --  no more of that . Is n't it funny ? The minute I know a man is all mine  --  without reservation , no unexplored region in his mind  --  all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an awful thing to admit  --  but I lose interest . RODERICK DEAN That 's your shallow nature . ABBY FANE Well , it 's a lie . It 's not true . RODERICK DEAN Wish you 'd make up your mind . ABBY FANE Well  --  I 've got rid of Cass  --  you 've got rid of me  --  now what ? p. 139 RODERICK DEAN Doubtless you 'll manipulate your freedom . ABBY FANE Freedom . That 's what it is for you  --  for me it 's just being adrift . Well , that 's no novelty to me . I 've been adrift before . No novelty to be poor either . Why , of all the men in the world , did I have to marry you ? Will you please tell me ? What have you done to me Mr. Deane ? Perhaps our mistake lay in marrying . If I 'd been your mistress  --  instead of your wife  --  if my position had been  --  unofficial  --  I 'd have been kept in my own routine  --  the things I was used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solution for me Rod , to divorce you and become your mistress . RODERICK DEAN Do n't be flippant . ABBY FANE I 'm not . You 're not going entirely monkish  --  as Sig suggests . You 'll want somebody , I suppose . Might as well be me . You 're used to me after all  --  a little bit  --  RODERICK DEAN This humility of yours is a bit excessive  --  I suspect it . I ca n't see you somehow , in the rle of Ruth following meekly the man of your dreams . ABBY FANE Diabolical . I might  --  for a while  --  RODERICK DEAN I thought so . p. 140 ABBY FANE Well , do you expect eternal adoration  --  eternal obedience ? How can I promise that ? All I can tell you is that at this moment I 'd rather go to Russia with you than to Florida with Cass . I may change again , damn it all , look how you 've changed . RODERICK DEAN Thanks to you . Do n't think I 'm not grateful . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you said certain things to me . ABBY FANE Oh , Rod , I was angry  --  RODERICK DEAN Nevertheless they were home truths . Weakling  --  hypochondriac  --  ineffectual  --  they rang in my ears . I 'll never forget what you said to me that night . ABBY FANE I 'll never forget the things you did to me that night . You were no longer interested  --  you dismissed me . You sent me to Cass . RODERICK DEAN Bursting out at her . And you went , did n't you ? ABBY FANE So , that 's it . RODERICK DEAN Yes , that 's it ! ABBY FANE Yes , I went to him . I was so furious . I said to myself . He wants me  --  he can take me . When I got there I could n't go through with it . I did n't . Then  --  I waited for you to call me . A day  --  two  --  I knew by the way I had hurt you that you loved me . I pictured you struggling not to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A week  --  two weeks  --  three weeks . You did n't call me . Then I said to myself " This is n't control , this is anemia . " This taunt is too much for him  --  he grasps her arm. p. 141 RODERICK DEAN Fiercely . Did you ! Did you ! Did you ! ABBY FANE Demurely . Well , maybe I was wrong ! RODERICK DEAN His arms around her . You were , damn it  --  I wish you were n't . You  --  you  --  And to think that only five minutes ago I was boasting that I 'd got rid of you . ABBY FANE No such luck . What are you resenting ? The fact that you belong to the human race ? RODERICK DEAN No , the fact that you do . ABBY FANE I may be an evil but I 'm necessary . RODERICK DEAN Helpless . I wish to God I could find an antidote for you . ABBY FANE All right , I 'll reform . No more tricks . I 'll lead the simple life . RODERICK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abby , can I ever make an honest woman out of you ? ABBY FANE All her assurance with her again . No , dear  --  nobody could ever make an honest woman out of me . RODERICK DEAN That 's true . p. 142 ABBY FANE Are n't you glad ? RODERICK DEAN Bitterly . Do n't get coy on me . ABBY FANE I 'm not . I 'm in love with you . RODERICK DEAN That 's a loose expression . It permits you too much latitude . I derive no comfort from it . ABBY FANE You will , honey . RODERICK DEAN Trollope ! ABBY FANE Missionary ! RODERICK DEAN I 'll convert you if it 's the last thing I ever do . ABBY FANE All right . Convert me . It 's so late , Rod , I think I 'll spend the night here . Is n't it awful to think  --  that it 's perfectly legal ? RODERICK DEAN Suddenly touched by her . I do n't know . There is , about you , the eternal glamor of the illicit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where did you learn to say things like that ? In the morning I 'll get hold of the group of specialists and get your money back for you . RODERICK DEAN Now look here , young lady  --  ABBY FANE Self-sacrificing . No , for your own good , darling . I want you to have a career  --  with the money and me there 's no reason you could n't do anything you like  --  be an ambassador or something  --  anything . p. 143 RODERICK DEAN I do n't want to be an ambassador . We 're going to be poor and out of the lime light  --  and you 're going to like it . ABBY FANE Oh , Rod , now be reasonable . If you insist on being an idealist you might as well be a successful one . RODERICK DEAN Homicidal  --  his hand is on her throat . Some day , sweetheart , I 'll probably murder you . ABBY FANE An eager victim . O.K. Chief . The impulse to murder becomes at once the impulse to love . She is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The " group of specialists " and his eccentricity she will manage in the morning  --  immediately she enfolds him in the solace of her love.
