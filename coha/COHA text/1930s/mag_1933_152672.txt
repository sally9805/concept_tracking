There were strange goings-on at Philadelphia 's proud Academy of Music one afternoon last week . The stage was apparently deserted but emanating from it like phantom music came the shimmering sounds of Rimsky-Korsakov 's Russian Easter , reproduced as faithfully as if the Philadelphia Orchestramen were sitting in their accustomed places , the violins down front on the left of the stage , the brasses farther back on the right , with cymbals , bells and kettledrums behind . There were other weird happenings that afternoon . Footsteps sounded spookily on the empty stage . Voices were heard asking for hammers and saws and a band of unseen carpenters seemed to start pounding away on the boards . Again the unseen orchestra played , this time the finale to Wagner 's Gotterdammerung . It climbed to such mighty crescendos that even hard-headed scientists sitting in the audience could imagine that 2,000 men or more were playing to them . <P> Conductor Leopold Stokowski was demonstrating a new " Ceno-orchestra System , " * result of a two-year experiment with Bell Telephone Laboratories . Dr. Stokowski sat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switches . Three floors above in the Academy ballroom his Orchestra , conducted by Alexander Smallens , played into specially-sensitized microphones which relayed the music to three loudspeakers concealed behind curtains backstage . <P> Hitherto one loudspeaker has been considered sufficient to transmit orchestral music . The use of three last week , strategically placed , was what distributed the sound as though the players were on the stage , gave what engineers called " auditory perspective . " The filters and amplifiers , which Stokowski manipulated , brought out the faintest whispers of the violins as they never have been brought out before . The climaxes , louder than any orchestra could have achieved unaided , were almost deafening but they were not distorted . Offstage singing was also reproduced , with force and clarity . <P> In his ardor to build up one of the Wagnerian crescendos Conductor Stokowski twisted a dial off his control desk . In a speech after the demonstration he prophesied a day when " there will be music in small-town auditoriums as splendid as that which is now played by fine symphony orchestras in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure in which happy idlers , after a brief day 's work , wander amid the trees while they listen to the strains of great music played in some distant music tower . " <P> <P> *Punned by engineers as " So-No-Orchestra System . "
