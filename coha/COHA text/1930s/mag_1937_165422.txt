Except for notoriously bad equipment , nothing had threatened the prospects of Covent Garden 's Coronation operas ( TIME , May 3 ) . Director Sir Thomas Beecham had engaged such guest conductors as Wilhelm Furtwngler , John Barbirolli , Francesco Salfi , Artur Rodzinski , Fritz Reiner . Eugene Goossens of the Cincinnati Symphony had been hired to conduct the world premiere of Don Juan de Manara , a bloodthirsty opera differing widely from Mozart 's Don Giovanni , which he had composed for the late Arnold Bennett 's libretto . He had succeeded in combining with his own company the Paris Grand Opera and Opra-Comique . Colonel de Basil 's Ballet Russe had been billed to dance . Metropolitan Opera participants included Kirsten Flagstad , Gina Cigna , Kerstin Thorborg , Lauritz Melchior , Lawrence Tibbett , Giovanni Martinelli , John Brownlee . The Coronation season was to last eleven weeks instead of the usual six . Yet in London last week curtains dropped on an opera season which , promising to be the best in years , had turned out to be the worst . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performances , critics found little to commend . They considered Otello " dull , " " flat , " " not up to the usual standard of Covent Garden . " In the Sunday Times Ernest Newman pronounced Don Pasquale " an exasperation and a pain from first to last . " When critics on the Evening News , the Manchester Guardian , the Star and the News Chronicle came out with adverse criticism of Cesare Formichi 's singing in Falstaff , Covent Garden stopped sending them tickets . Even the Times was moved to protest the " disarrangement " of Orphe and Prince Igor , in which the Ballet Russe did not supplement the singers but stole the show from them . While Sir Thomas Beecham quietly prepared to leave London on a vacation , people gossiped that he would not renew his Covent Garden contract next year . But only cheers awaited Vice Chairman Frank Pick of the London Passenger Transport Board , who wrote to the Times : <P> " The time has come to protest against scenery and production which are an insult alike to the eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridiculous the action of the opera . How may the artistic conscience of the authorities of Covent Garden be stirred ? "
