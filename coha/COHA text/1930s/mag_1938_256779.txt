In Barcelona last week opened a political trial so engrossing that even a major air raid , even , the shattering concussion of bombs which exploded a few hundred yards from the courtroom did not distract the judges , prisoners or spectators . In an atmosphere electric with hate and Spanish passion , Andrs Nin was at last put on trial in absentia . Andrs Nin 's small , blonde Russian wife or widow had a ringside spectator 's seat . <P> According to Leon Trotsky , whose faithful secretary Andrs Nin was in Russia during the Revolution , there is little if any doubt that Mr. Nin was taken from a jail in Madrid last year by Communists of the Stalin persuasion and murdered . With this view many Socialists , including Norman Thomas , agree-while deprecating the further Trotskyist charge that the Government connived at the assassination . In court last week the Government prosecutor took the position that Seora Nin is the wife of a traitor who escaped from jail , fled abroad and has been in hiding for the past 26 months . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Barcelona trial last week , just as Leon Trotsky was the focus of the Moscow trial after which 16 Trotskyists were executed ( TIME , Aug. 31 , 1936 ) . In the prisoners ' box at Barcelona sat seven Ninists . The seven and Nin were charged , as members of his P.O.U.M. , or Workers Party for Marxist Unification , with high treason , espionage and " ominous activities . " As an example of these the long indictment charged : " They provoked a real revolution in Catalonia in May 1937 , fought against the police and even managed to make an army division in which they had been carrying on their criminal work abandon the front . " What had happened was that the extremely independent P.O.U.M. militia had refused to become absorbed in the new , unified and reformed People 's Army on the Aragon front . <P> The fact that this treason trial , held with full constitutional procedure , was open to the public-many traitors in the civil war 's early days having been dispatched to their graves by star-chamber proceedings-was stressed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this trial would convince influential British opinion that it is not Red . Therefore , the most important charge , all correspondents agreed , was not any of the capital charges of treason for which the seven may be shot if found guilty . It was the charge that the defendants " did all they could to give the Government an extremist i.e. , Red nature , which it never had and which is not the will of the Spanish people . " <P> Spaniards , the seven prisoners reeled off no Russian tissue of confessions , but denied at the top of their lungs everything except that they had all had more or less to do with La Batalla , the Nin newspaper which the Leftist Government suppressed for noncooperation . <P> The prisoner known as Gorkin or Gmez , a revolutionist of several aliases , made most news in court . " Did you know any agents of the Nazi Gestapo ? " asked the prosecutor , who was trying to prove that the P.O.U.M. was not really Marxist but Fascist . " No , I did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding with the authentic Spanish touch , " but if I had known one I would have killed him . "
