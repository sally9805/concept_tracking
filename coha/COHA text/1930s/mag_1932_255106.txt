Japan 's promised " Big Drive " into China began at Shanghai last week with every modern weapon ( except poison gas ) including " crawling dragons . " <P> Eighteen hours after the Japanese drive was launched it was 16 hours behind Japanese Lieut. - General Kenkichi Uyeda 's carefully planned schedule . Not since Royal Belgium delayed Imperial Germany has an overwhelming onslaught been so spectacularly delayed . <P> Japanese soldiers , once their advance got completely behind schedule , fought with mounting ferocity which presently became " frightfulness . " Neutral white witnesses reported with horror how Chinese civilians were shot down , how Chinese property in the form of houses , barns , hay and grain was ignited by the Japanese . <P> Such is war , as General Sherman said in 1864 , and as Shanghai saw last week . The Japanese commander , General Uyeda , was personally desperate . He knew he might have to commit hara-kiri if his offensive got much further behind schedule , and during the first 18 hours he changed his General Staff Headquarters three times : 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cottage ; 3 ) Ti Futan University . <P> How was the Japanese drive slowed up ? Chinese heroism was not enough to stem the onslaught . Royal Belgium held out so long chiefly because her own able fighters had had so much previous assistance from the French General Staff . Last week " Three Germans " ( men of a certain mystery but all experienced veterans of the World War ) were said to be assisting the Chinese defenders of Shanghai. * <P> Thus last week three of Japan 's 20 " crawling dragons , " tanks of formidable power , were wrecked as they advanced , merely by treading upon Chinese land mines . That way of crippling a " crawling dragon " the Chinese may have thought up themselves , or they may have been told by the " Three Germans . " <P> Battles . What Japan had set out to conquer was the Woosung Forts 16 miles from Shanghai ; the Chinese district in Shanghai called Chapei ; and the land between Shanghai and Woosung . Most spectacular feature of this intermediate terrain last week was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and railway station of Kiangwan . <P> Around two sides of the terrain bends the Whangpoo River , thus putting much of the theatre of warfare at the mercy of Japanese fleet guns . Japan also possessed command of the air . Her land artillery was superior to the Chinese . Therefore , General Uyeda was not , from the Japanese standpoint , unduly optimistic when he planned to complete his entire drive within 18 hours . The drive was timed to begin on Japanese election day ( see p. 22 ) and Premier Inukai of Japan assumed that in such circumstances his Seiyukai Party could not fail to win the Japanese Election . <P> General Uyeda at 7:30 a. m. launched his military attack , striking straight for the race course , and expecting to occupy Kiangwan ( just beyond ) within two hours . Advancing in skirmish formation , the Japanese soldiers prudently took cover behind each tree or hummock before advancing to the next , and ahead of them a Japanese barrage of overwhelming power advanced , blowing the Chinese out of their trenches . Thus there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
