While fat , young Vittorio Mussolini was getting a Bronx bird in Hollywood last month ( TIME , Oct. 18 ) Rome was turning Hollywood Director Rouben Mamoulian into a lion . To Hollywood , II Duce 's son was the unattractive symbol of a repressive political system . To Rome , Director Mamoulian , despite his Hollywood background , was an artist and a good one . Film Tsar Luigi Freddi entertained him at his home , where no Hollywoodman has been before . Princess Jane San Faustino ( ne Jane Campbell of Manhattan ) introduced him to Crown Prince Umberto at a smart midnight party . Admirers brought him gifts-art objects , rare books , an Eleonora Duse autograph . Naive-looking , bespectacled Mamoulian finally fled , dazzled , to restful Capri . <P> No sooner had injured Vittorio returned than Rome picked up its cudgels . Rushing from an interview with II Duce , the editor of ultra-Fascist Il Tevere had his paper on the streets two hours later , condemning Hollywood for threefold intrusion into Italian cinemaffairs : 1 ) invasion of the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of means , " 2 ) control of distribution , 3 ) a threat to enter the theatre field ( Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer 's plan for a circuit of its own in Italy ) . Italy permits Hollywood to take home $1,000,000 profit annually . Since this represents a return of one twentieth of one percent on a two billion dollar investment , Hollywood was concerned , but mildly .
