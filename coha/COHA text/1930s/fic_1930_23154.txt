THE QUEER ISLAND A STORY BY LORD DUNSANY I T WAS the same fog that we 'd had for a week . Trees , when seen , were spectral , full of vague omens . Houses were outlines of windows appearing out of one dimness . But one turned away from these things to the warmth and light of a room . We were before the fire again at the Billiards Club , a slightly narrower circle . Not that we were fewer than when Jorkens had told his story about the large diamond three or four days ago ; but it was colder , and we moved in nearer the fire . Jorkens was there again , and silent  --  a little , what shall I say ? Well , one must rest a bit after lunch to digest one 's food ; he was merely resting . And another member had taken the opportunity to tell a tale of his own . It had been a long , long story , obviously an attempt to emulate Jorkens , and at last it drew to its close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it was saying , " my blood ran cold . " This kind of climax coming on top of the dull tale was somehow more than we could stand without some sort of protest . " Can words ever make one 's blood run cold ? " asked one . " Why not ? " said the storyteller . " But riot the mere words ; not cold , " said the other . " Yes they can , " said Jorkens . I had thought that he was asleep . We all turned to Jorkens then . But the critic stuck to his point . " Well , what were the actual words ? " he asked Jorkens . " Can you remember them ? " " Yes , well enough , " said Jorkens . " Well , what were they ? " " The actual words , " said Jorkens , " were : ' Now Arthur Tibbuts , do n't think that just because you are English you can pick a quarrel with whom you please . ' " " Does n't sound very ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made my blood go cold , all like slush in a thaw ; and the goose-flesh came out , and that made all the little hairs on my hands go up on end . You 're wrong about words not being able to do that , because they did it , and on a warm day too , away at the far end of the Mediterranean . " Marden , who does n't usually listen to Jorkens ' tales with much patience , was the first to ask for the story . Probably he thought that Jorkens was bluffing , and may have anticipated that a challenge to prove his words might quieten Jorkens for some days . Anyhow , Jorkens began . And just about then I remember the fog came down in earnest ; the white lines of the windowsills opposite disappeared , and only the yellow lights of those that were not curtained shone from across the way ; all else was a bank of darkness going dimly into dark sky , which hung on the roofs so heavily that you could scarce tell them apart . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mediterranean . Some while ago now . A little rocky island over at the far end . I 'd gone there with a young fellow , Sir Richard Isden ; still alive , only grown respectable . Oh , damned respectable . One of the brightest young fellows I ever knew . One of the very brightest . " " What ? Isdcn ? " said one of us . " Isden ? " said Jorkens . " No , no , no . Sits on committees . The blood of his aunts came out in him . I do n't mean him . I mean the young Dick Isden knew when he was twenty . A very different thing . Time makes queer changes , " " Really , " said someone meditatively , thinking of the Sir Richard Isden he knew . " Queer changes , " said Jorkens . " Well , Dick Isden began as he ended . But he was n't like that always . I knew him first , meeting him quite by chance while he was out for a short walk . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a small house called The Lilacs , right on the village green . They had caught him quite young , for his father died when lie was five , and he had never known his mother . There was no one else to dispute their claim , so it seemed that there was no escape for him . They never sent him to school ; they wanted him where they could always watch over his health . And every morning the two old ladies would open the Bible together , at any page , just by chance , to see what should be done with Dick . They always found something that they could twist , and that decided Dick 's amusements for the day . Well , perhaps amusements is n't the right word but , whatever it is , that 's how they decided it . And some episode that had occurred between him and their under-housemaid ( nipped in the bud , I expect ) had given them a horrible hold on him . Well , this had been going on for years when I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had allowed him for the good of his health , and because it coincided with a walk that Julius Cmsar had taken , which they had just been reading about . Not in the Bible , is n't he ? Well , someone who was . " He interested me as soon as I saw him coming along ; there was a sort of look in his eye that you might see in the face of an eagle that had got shut up in a very small , pretty cage and was being fed on bird-seed , if you quite follow me , and we got into conversation . It seemed that he did n't mind their Bible so much ; what he could n't stand was when it came to their hymns , and it very often did . " He very soon told me all about his life  --  if you can call it a life  --  and his aunts . Was that really the right way to live , he asked me ? He knew that his aunts did everything for the best , but was I sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you see . " Well , I felt like a swimmer who had chanced to swim right onto a drowning man . Why not save him ? So I said he must judge for himself ; but , so as to be quite fair to the aunts , he should see a bit of the world first . Do you know , from the way he looked , I really do n't think he knew that there was a world . How should be do that , he asked ? I suggested Paris . He became thoughtful at that , and in the end said no . They 'd have spies there , ' he said . " ' Spies ? ' said I. " ' Not exactly , ' he said , ' but there 's sure to be one person there that they 'd know . And they 'd hear from that person at once . They 've an awful knack of getting information . ' " And I saw that he might be right . Quite a bright young fellow . And then I thought of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have done , so far away from that kind of aunt and all their ways that not a single bony finger , far as they reach , could ever close on his wrist there ; where no whisper of minatory advice could blow ; not a threat , not a warning . I thought of the journey through France , when winter is with us still , and you come in the morning to the almond and peach blushing into bloom in the south . And then the Mediterranean . Oh , that seal  --  Waiter , another whiskey ? And these islands at the far end of it , all bathed in summer forever . " It was autumn when I met Dick and went and called on his aunts . You may think me not quite the kind of caller those aunts would expect . My dear fellow , I was ideal . Young Dick had n't unburdened his heart to me for twenty minutes when I knew their patter exactly . I was a good example , a steadying influence , a light where there was darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every word of it . But it was autumn in that house , autumn forever . The aunts ' hair , their jet brooches , their thoughts , their phrases , the antimacassars on the chairs , the fading photographs , all the ornaments in the room  --  they were all autumnal things , all waning , weakening forces . " I hung about the place for a few days , dropping in to tea and talking like a steadying influence , and a light where there was darkness ; and if I 'd done it a few days longer they would have given Dick over to me with their own hands . But I could n't . That autumnal air that brooded over The Lilacs made me too sad . I could n't stand any more of it . There was a beauty in their old ways and their old outlook . But it was all too sad . And there was Dick Iike a crocus , being covered up with dead leaves . " So one day I stole Dick . It was better that way . No breach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I assure you you might search through all the minor prophets and never find anything to equal them . It 's no use arguing about it , because I had them all down in writing , in letters they sent to Dick . Magnificent beyond words . They were just born prophets . Wrong time and wrong country of course ; but if one of them had gone up and prophesied against a city somewhere in , say , Assyria a few thousand years age , well that city would simply have wilted . I 'm pretty tough , and it takes more than that to ruffle me . And if you 'd asked me in those days if any words could affect me at all , I 'd have said , as you did just now , that the idea was all nonsense . Then , that was a week or so before I heard the woman on the island say those words that I told you . Well , I 'll get on with the story . " It was autumn , as I said ; Kent all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island , sleeping with summer , out of the way of those aunts . He 'd plenty of money ; I bought all the tickets ; and we slipped away from The Lilacs one day immediately after breakfast ; and the same morning we were leaving London for Folkestone . Next morning when we woke , Provence was smiling around us , mellowed by a milder autumn than ever comes north of France . White rocks , black cypresses , and all the gold of autumn raced past us through the morning ; and so we reached Marseilles . And a lot I could have shown him in Marseilles ; but he was too shaken by all those years with his aunts , to have let himself go even there . I could see it by the uneasy way he glanced sideways , without turning his head , at anyone who looked like coming from England . So we just dined at a place I knew of and went on board our boat , and she pushed out of Marseilles harbor from under the protection of Notre Dame de la Garde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some mountains along the coast winter was lurking in uplifted valleys ; southwards the Mediterranean promised us summer again . " Dick would n't say a word to the other passengers . The shadows of those two aunts were over him still . I knew they 'd lift , but not yet . " That night we passed through the straits of Bonifaccio , with their long line of lighthouses . ' What 's that street ? ' said Dick . Lord , but the world was new to him . " A large lake only ruffled by our screw seemed to lie round us next morning , too serene for any sea . Oh , the beauty of it ! And to think that it 's shining there now ! " I went to the forecastle head and looked down into that blue sea , like a sapphire before us , but , level with us on our port side , too dark for a sapphire , where the ghost of the shadow of our ship lay faint on the water . At our prow a white fountain danced over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only wave in that part of the Mediterranean , a black wave bursting into light blue as it fell , then leaping up in white foam . The sky one dome of blue but for the frown of Stromboli . " That night we passed through the golden straits of Messina , all twinkling and flashing . And the night after , a little before morning , we got to Crete and anchored . That was , I think , a Saturday ; and as a ship for the islands only left on Fridays , we hung about a bit in Crete . There was quite a pretty girl there ; several in fact , but Dick soon spotted the prettiest ; and I saw him looking at her in a thoughtful way . You see he was still puzzled what to do about anything without the aunts to look up a text for him . We might have stayed quite a while in Crete , but I was bent on saving this poor lost soul as completely as it could be saved , and I had set my heart on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spring flowers come up in sheets in January , and the girls are lovelier than the flowers . So we went on the Friday , and that brought us into December . The absurd little steamer took us nearly a week to get there , stopping at various islands . I remember she was called The Queen Regent of Palermo . " Why ? I do n't know Never was such a person so far as I 've heard . As well ask me why we call a ship The Empress of Ireland . It 's the sort of name some ships get . " The islands were pinky yellow , when first we saw them , under pinky yellow clouds ; far , far off , so that , you could not always tell which was a cloud and which was an island , except for the pale blue shadows the island had . It made them strangely mysterious to see them so like the clouds . It made one feel that they might float away . It made one understand how they got all mixed up with legend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clouds seemed to come down closer upon them , and to turn black with the islands . This fellowship of the fantastic shapes of the air with the queer wild rocks below them really gave me quite an uncanny kind of feeling , and it was this as much as anything that prepared my mind to associate this rugged rocky company with the legends which had haunted them through the ages . That point of view may seem silly , sitting here in the fog , but when one actually saw a ship , with her sails all black with nightfall , slip out of sight into one of those tiny harbors one forgot for the moment that Odysseus was about three thousand years dead . " Well , night came down on the islands , and some seemed asleep , and some like boxes of jewels , open and all heaped up , handfuls and handfuls of rather yellowy diamonds , and here and there a ruby ; and trees invisible to us in the night , but revealed by a trembling of shadows over the lights , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we came to the one I was looking for , a little thing you would never have seen on the map ; it was called Inos . Girls from a little white village were standing along the wharf to see our ship come in , slender , tall figures very straight and supple , brownish complexion and bright fluttering clothes . I turned to Dick and just said , There are no aunts here . ' " Dick was no fool . He was only cowed . A fool would have argued that there must be aunts everywhere . But he understood , and his eye brightened , like the sea when a shadow passes : at last the memory of the aunts was lifting . " Well , we played about there for some weeks , staying at a little kind of an inn . Oh , dear me , I suppose we 've all been young , but often in this fog I forget it , forget it altogether and really do n't believe that I was ever young at all . I ca n't remember , I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all that sunlight shone , and all that laughter was rippling along little hills in the evening . And I would n't tell you anything that I was not sure was true . It 's no use ; I forget it . all . " Well , it 's very good of you . One does n't really need it . But it 's very good of you . And this fug . Thanks , I will . Well , here 's luck . What was saying ? Ah , yes , those golden girls ; and spring beginning in January . Well , as I was saying , we played about awhile . And young Dick was really wonderful . The very , very brightest lad you could reasonably expect to meet . Of course there were little difficulties now and then , but I 'm not going to talk of those : I was older than he , knew more of the world , and I smoothed them over . About that time the first letters arrived . Never mind them , either . They described Hell very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly magnificent . A natural prophetic style . But , good Lord , I 'd saved him from Hell , as I saw it . No , what I was going to say was that about that time Dick came to my room one morning with a thoughtful look in his eye and said that there was a woman who was perfectly wonderful whom he had come across in the village while she was shopping . There was a rocky hill in the center of the island , and a large white house half way up , with wide courts open to the air , their roofs resting upon white pillars  --  she lived there . She 'd asked Dick and me to stay , and Dick was thinking about going . Well , why not ? That was all I had to say . And we went . " Now this woman , it 's no use my trying to describe her . You wo n't see her for any words of mine . She was dark , she was rather tall , she was rather slender : that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most astounding beauty , and that is n't a thing there is a recipe for . It ca n't be acquired by having certain features , and it ca n't be described in words . She was n't so very dark either ; there was a clear touch of auburn in her hair , and her skin was no darker than the southern sun would make anybody 's . Her eyes were dark , but that 's saying nothing . There was an enormous power in them , and a flash of them seemed able almost to petrify a man . I 've felt it onmyself , and I never quite knew what was going to happen ; there have been times when I felt that in another moment . . . but that comes later in my story ; as yet she had not even looked at me . But that power was always there , and not over men only . I 've seen her frighten a leopard by gazing at him  --  she kept leopards . And she spoke perfect English . The beauty of her face and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hers are things I shall remember still when I remember nothing else . And that 's what Dick in the very newness of his heart came on one day when she was shopping . Her dog had attacked her , and Dick had driven it off . That was their introduction . 1 remember picturing her as a poor , weak little thing if she could n't control her own dog . Good Lord , she had hideous power . Her dog attacking her was of course just a put-up job , to attract Dick . That dog had to do what it was told when those eyes flashed at it , . I soon learned that . ' But Dick would never see it . It was just one of those things that his aunts had never taught him . Not that they did n't know . You see women have got a sort of Trades Union that we know nothing of . They meet every seven years or so , though I do n't know where , and tell those present all the tricks that are known , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing about . It must be so when you come to think of it , or how could quite young girls know as much as they do ? Well , perhaps I 'm wrong . I certainly was n't able to convince Dick . " I soon saw how it was with Dick : it was a grand passion  --  if you can quite describe as a grand passion anything that lasts only a few weeks . Anyhow , it was while it lasted . There she was showing him about her lovely southern garden , with the early flowers flaring against the rocks , and her two tame leopards slinking up and down , and Dick going everywhere after her just like a pet lamb . " I did n't interfere . She and her leopards were a lot better for him , to my way of thinking , than those aunts and their canaries . " And so the early spring wore away with her and Dick as the early spring wears away with everybody . Dear me , it was dull for me sometimes , looking on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming again , even then : it 's just all damned fog now . ? Well , look at it . " I was n't jealous of Dick , only regretful and I 'd no cause to be that . It was a lovely house , a beautiful time of year , a perfectly enchanted country . The only thing I did n't care about in all her wonderful hospitality was the way she had of keeping pigs in the house . I did n't mind the dogs , but pigs and leopards were too much . You never knew what you were going to run up against in any room , from goats to , welt , anything . Of course it would have been absolutely intolerable but for her wonderful command of them all . As it was , one just stood it . " Of course I counted for nothing there . She was looking dreamily at Dick all the time . Right past me if I happened to be nearer . I doubt if she could see me at all . And Dick was a good fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how it was far on into February . " And then one day he seems to have begun asking questions . Where did she come from ? How did she learn English ? Who were her parents ? What was her name ? For she only gave us a Christian name , if you can call it such a thing ; and even that she varied , sometimes as often as two or three times a week , according to what flower might be corning up in her garden . And of course the answers he got were of no use at all . Sometimes she said she came from the air , sometimes from the sea . She said she was blown by the wind from some snow on the mountains of Crete . She said she was thistledown , massed rose-petals : anything that came into her head . You know , that kind of answer can be very annoying to a young man that really wants to know . " So one day at the end of February , on a morning bright as a dewdrop , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been inconceivable , he asked some question about which day ships left the island . As a matter of fact , it was on alternate Thursdays . But she never said so ; she just stood and gazed at him . However , he stuck to his point ; he could n't stay there forever ; he had a business paper to sign when he came of age , and a horse to buy , and one thing and another ; and which day did ships leave the island ? Do you know , she never said a word to him . I was the man that got the whole brunt of it . And she had n't been able to notice me for nearly a month . I got the brunt of it suddenly , all in one moment , when she said those terrible words , that I do n't repeat willingly even to-day and after all those years because there seems to be still an echo about them of the icy shudder they brought me when she said them first to her dog . Yes , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , white marble everywhere , and a pig or two lying on it , and one of the leopards that she had brought in from the garden ; and her bulldog , who liked the leopard little enough out of doors , furious with it for being in the house , and snarling and wanting to rush at it : she standing there like a witch-queen , and I just coming in at a door behind her , and you have the whole picture . And just as I did come in I heard those words to her bulldog ; and I tell you they froze my blood ; my heart actually stopped for a beat or two and my blood turned cold , and my pulses seem to remember it to this day . Now Arthur Tibbuts , ' she said , ' do n't think that just because you 're English you can pick a quarrel with whom you please . ' " The woman herself , her island , right on the course , so far as we know , that Odysseus must have steered coming home from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was more than that to turn my blood to ice . I had known one Arthur Tibbuts , known him in London well , and he had traveled east one day , and had disappeared as completely as Browning 's Waring . " " Good Lord , " said someone quietly . " Well , you can imagine that I went to Dick pretty quickly , and told him that you could not play fast and loose with these island women . I do n't know what I told him , anything that came into my head . Told him they all carried knives ; told him they had a bad way with absconding lovers , an old island custom . I knew that a woman like that would want change in a year or two , anyhow , from young Dick Isden . But , for the present I told him he must wait , and that it was not safe to be seen even thinking about that ship that was going on Thursday week , not that I told him which day it went . And Dick did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't frighten him . " What was Ito do next ? He saw that I was absolutely stricken with horror . And there was he young and smiling , but he had n't heard what she had said to the dog . And I was n't going to tell him . Well , I went straight to her and said to her , ' Madame Anemone ( that was the name she was going under just then ) , I heard what you said to that dog . ' And she said , ' What 's done ca n't be undone . ' And I said , ' Maybe , but do n't hurt young Dick . ' And she said , ' Then tell Dick not to play fast and loose . ' " Those were the only words that passed between us , with the dog and the leopard looking at her eyes as she spoke , to see if everything was all right , and I dumbly trusting that , if she was what I feared , there was yet a certain rough justice even among cruel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and in the hope of which I now sheltered , for I had done her no wrong . " I went straight back to Dick and denied everything I had said about vengefulness , and knives , and island customs , and told him she was just a simple , trusting girl who knew nothing of the big world from which Dick had come . Yes , I said all that to him . And I put it to him as a sort of ' noblesse oblige ' between one who knew the big world , like Dick , and one who only lived like one of the flowers after which she childishly named herself in a dell of this tiny island away at the back of beyond . " And Dick asked , ' Does she want a ring and all that ? ' " And I , who knew she only cared for essentials , said a simple , trustful girl like her would never make a fuss about anything of that sort . " And in the end he stayed . And I hung about for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing all sorts of odd jobs , chiefly seeing that the wild sort of men whom she employed about the place to look after her animals , and one thing and another , did their work while she was n't looking . When she was looking they dare n't do anything else . Worked with the sweat streaming from them for as long as they were under her eye . " But as soon as the summer began to get too hot I cleared off and came back to these fogs . And glad I was to get safely back to them ; for , day or night , I never quite knew . " And Jorkens gazed past us out into the darkness , as though his thoughts had not wholly come home to London yet . It was all he had to say . And whatever doubts we had , no one as yet had obtruded them , while we listened to his story rambling on , with the streak of poetry that there was deep down in Jorkens coining almost in sight of the surface or sinking back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now that he had ceased and we looked at London again , all robed in that cloak it so often wears in November , and at all the little familiar things in the room , I am not exaggerating if I say that there was not one of us who believed him . For a while we sat perfectly silent . Then someone said , " But do you mean that you really think she was Circe ? " " No , " said Jorkens , " I know she was n't . It turned out , so far as we were able to find , that she was a Mrs. Harbett who had lived a pretty fast life in London . " " Then what are you getting at ? " said the other member . " Why did you tell us Tibhuts had disappeared from London ? Why did she call her dog by that name ? What is the meaning of it ? " " Well , " said Jorkens , " you know what women are . I suppose she knew it would get round to Dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping him if I got some sort of queer idea about it all . And Lord knows I did . Anyway , he stayed . Oh , yes , they married , to some extent , and lived happily , well , not ever after , but till she grew tired of him , and then he came away . But you would n't think it to see him at a board meeting , would you ? " He turned his eyes back meditatively-to the fog . " You see , " he said after a while , " one never knows . " TWO BY A GRAVE BY ELIZABETH HOLLISTER FROST HE 'S mine ! " one said . " He married me Ten years ago , fine Miss ! Why Mere is Betty 's grave and Tim 's And Lou 's , a-side o ' his ! " " You lie ! the priest will say you lie ! You have a hateful face ! He married me in Chile At Galapagos ' place . " " You fool ! he never sailed in ship That went around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rut I have one unborn . " " He 's mine ! " one said . " No , he is mine ! " ? From off the graveyard trees The slow leaves fell till both of them Were buried to the knees .
