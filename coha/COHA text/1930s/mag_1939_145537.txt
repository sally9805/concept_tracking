When the retractable landing gear on one of Imperial Airways ' three new luxurious , 22-passenger Frobishers jammed over Croydon Airport last month , its passengers jauntily drank a toast in champagne " To disaster-if it comes ! " A mechanic got the wheels down pn that occasion . <P> One day last week , with wheels down , another Frobisher dropped down on roomy Croydon . Its legs collapsed , and it slid ignominiously to a stop on its belly . This time the passengers , 21 of them , were plain scared , thoroughly shaken up . Imperial imperturbably grounded the 234-mile-an-hour ships to get the bugs out of the landing gear . At week 's end the ships were restored to service . The mishap , said bland Imperial , was " due to the unusual state ol the airdrome surface , not to a mechanical defect . " Nineteen-year-old Croydon is one of the oldest and best-tended air fields on earth .
