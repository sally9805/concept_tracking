txt Broad expansion of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and the extension of its statutory life were indicated as essential today by Jesse Jones , chairman , if the RFC is to carry out the current program for extending assistance to banks . Following a conference with the President , Mr. Jones told newspaper men that the corporation would need between $500,000,000 and $1,000,000,000 of new funds for loans to closed banks ; he had announced earlier at his own offices that purchase of capital notes or preferred stock of open banks had been authorized in the cases of 2,443 banks for a total commitment of $627,000,000 . Closed banks have re ? ceived $540,000,000 from the RFC . Mr. Jones said at the White House that the corporation 's funds have been practically used up through outstanding loans and commitments , but that sufficient money remains to carry on until Congress meets . The corporation now owes the Treasury $2,233,000,000 , he added , but said he did not know the exact balance on hand . Repayments to the corporation by borrowers have passed the $1,000,000,000 mark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 Additional authority to make loans probably will have to be obtained from Congress . Mr. Jones said , and he indicated that not only this authority but also an act extending the life of the corporation beyond Jan. 23 , when it would expire under the old statute , would be requested . The extension period requested probably will be one year . Even after the active life of the RFC shall have ceased , Mr. Jones went on , at least ten years would be required to wind up the widespread affairs of the organization , including large loans to banks , railroads and life insurance companies . Mr. Jones , in announcing the bank stock purchases , said that 3,160 applications had been received , 1,875 from State charter banks not members of the Reserve System and 1,285 from member banks . Of the total authorizations , 1,560 aggregating $99,800,000 have been made to non-member banks and the remainder to member institutions . Authorizations involving 414 banks have been made in the last three days . Applications received , it was said , represent about 22 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to date about 17 per cent . Purchases to Reach Billion . The original goal was to have the RFC purchase up to $1,000,000,000 of stock and notes . This money has been planned as a bulwark for the capital structures of banks , enabling them to expand their credit facilities in order to aid the recovery program , as well as to make banks eligible for membership in the Deposit Insurance Corporation . Mr. Jones expressed the opinion that the 81,000,000,000 would be reached and urged that applications be made quickly . The RFC has been authorized by Congress to make an unlimited amount of purchases and Mr. Jones was asked if the operations would stop when $1,000,000,000 had been used . " No , " he said ; " we will stop when we get through . But I do n't think it will run over a billion dollars . " The drive by the RFC to release deposits in closed banks is being accelerated . Mr. Jones said that he had not make a check-up of the total of deposits actually released ? but that distribution of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much money as possible into the hands of the depositors before Christmas . Industrial Loans May Come Up . As to plans for direct loans to industries , Mr. Jones stated that the corporation did not yet know how far it could go in that direction . " Congress has got to tell us , I guess , " he said . Mr. Jones said that more than 2,000 inquiries had been received about the possibility of obtaining loans , mostly from smaller business concerns . In the last Congress legislation for direct loans to industry was withheld , and such advances as have been made of this character have been obtained through the formation by industries of community mortgage loan companies , to which the RFC has authority to ? make ' loan There have been intimations that the issue of direct loans to industry by the RFC would be brought before Congress when it assembles on Jan. 3 , but Mr. Jones declined to discuss that phase . The demand for such action has been based on the theory that banks have been hesitant in making loans to industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been expressed , however , that with deposit insurance in operation after Jan. 1 , a point may soon be reached in the extension of loans by banks which will make unnecessary drastic efforts to place the RFC in direct competition with banks in connection with business loans .
