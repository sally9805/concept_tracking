A Man to Remember ( RKO Radio ) . The idea that good pictures cost more than bad ones is so firmly rooted in the Hollywood subconscious that when a producer contrives to make a cheap picture which is also good , it occasions an almost panic confusion . Thus when , in A Man to Remember , Producer Robert Sisk and Director Garson Kanin turned out a film which , although budgeted for only $119,000 and made in 15 days , was unmistakably well above average A picture quality , RKO scarcely knew what to make of the situation . Finally the publicity department hit on a scheme . Instead of inviting critics in a body to a gala preview , RKO invited them in small groups to semiprivate showings , hoping thus to give each group the thrill of discovery . The scheme succeeded almost too well . By the time it was finally ready for release last week , A Man to Remember was one of the most pre-discovered pictures on record , appeared likely to have trouble living up to its advance ballyhoo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Abbott in the little midwest town of Westport , A Man to Remember shifts quickly to the office where Abbott 's lawyer is examining his papers , then proceeds , by means of a long cutback , to tell the story of his life , ending at the moment when the picture begins . John Abbott ( Edward Ellis ) , prototype of thousands of other country doctors in thousands of other Westports , was a humble , hard working general practitioner , too dour to be popular with his patients , too generous to make them pay their bills . Derived from Katharine Haviland Taylor 's story The Failure , related with notable economy , his brief , triumphant biography provides Edward Ellis with a character actor 's dream of a fat part . In it he gives a beautifully sustained , low-keyed characterization which , while probably not showy enough to get him an Academy Award , rates as one of Hollywood 's outstanding performances of the year . <P> Good sequence : Dr. Abbott , when his adopted daughter 's boy friend accidentally shoots her in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stingy father into giving Westport a hospital . <P> Suez ( Twentieth Century-Fox ) adds to the list of such notable cinema disasters as the earthquake of San Francisco and the fire of In Old Chicago the spectacle of a howling zobah-hah in the Arabian desert . As cinematically reproduced , a zobah-hah is a combination of cyclone and dust storm , accompanied by squeals , floods , twilight and the expenditure of $250,000 . In itself sufficient to make Suez rank as one of the major spectacles of the year , the zobah-hah is only an incident in the latest addition to the series of heroic-sized historical plays to which Producer Darryl Francis Zanuck , once a specialist in turning mere newspaper headlines into screen plays , has recently made his forte . Highly romanticized , handsomely decorated and reasonably entertaining , Suez shows Tyrone Power as Ferdinand de Lesseps , successively overcoming the obstacles provided by the climate , Napoleon III , his love for the Empress Eugnie ( Loretta Young ) , his sense of responsibility toward a towheaded waif ( Annabella ) , and the apathy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ditch from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean .
