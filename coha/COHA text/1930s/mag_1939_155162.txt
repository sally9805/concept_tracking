During the summer of 1938 , earnest , acidulous President Arthur Besse of the National Association of Wool Manufacturers took a look at his industry . He saw that its 560 firms had a net loss of more than $10,000,000 in the preceding six months and he grew sarcastic . Soon the trade received from President Besse a three-page printed blast against price cutting and reckless competition . <P> " In Memoriam-the Profit Motive , " read a black-bordered box on the cover . " Honorary pallbearers will be men prominent in the textile industry . " Inside the pamphlet the textile industry read the summary of its sins-a loss of $98,094,000 for the ten years ending with 1935 . Said he , ironically : " Perhaps if we defend our privileges and rights ( to sell for less than cost ) we may be able to lose even more in the period from 1936 to 1945 . " <P> Last week , before the Government 's Committee for Reciprocity Information at Washington , Arthur Besse made an earnest plea : 1 ) terminate all Mr. Hull 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tariffs on wool goods ) for the duration of the war ; 2 ) consider upping tariffs to prevent flooding of the U. S. market by foreign producers . Said he : " When the war is over we will be powerless to prevent a flood of foreign fabrics . " <P> Whatever may happen " when the war is over , " the wool industry last week was neither in need of tariff favors nor in danger of price cutting . It was in the midst of making a cleanup out of the war . For wool is a real war commodity-needed for soldiers ' uniforms , overcoats , blankets . The U. S. has no wool surplus and the British Empire has forbidden wool exports outside of the Empire . Besides raw wool , millions of yards of woolens normally imported from Britain ( 1938 imports : 4,800,000 sq . yds. ) will have to be made in the U. S. <P> Clothiers have predicted that men 's suits will be up $5 apiece by spring . If so , that rise will cost U. S. consumers about $280,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry last week appeared to be shearing their percentage of this fine clip : raw wool skyrocketed some 60% for the benefit of wool growers ; yarns were up 45% to 50% , sweetening the pot for the spinners ; and when the U. S. Army went into the market for uniform fabrics , it found prices up about 30% over the bids it could have gotten Sept. 1 , indicating that the mills were sharing the war profit . <P> Although the U. S. is the world 's No. 2 wool producer ( 1938 total : Australia 938,000,000 lbs. ; U. S. 436,500,000 ; Argentina 385,000,000 ) it is not self-sufficient . Relatively mild climate makes U. S. wool fine-fibred , usable only for apparel , draperies , upholstery , etc . Yet in the apparel class alone the U. S. produces only 70% of its consumption , had to import 94,000,000 lbs . in 1937 . With the chief suppliers , Australia and New Zealand ( 1937 aggregate , 51,000,000 lbs. ) , now out of the market , wool producers today can see bright days ahead . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produces not a bit . All of it is imported . Chief U. S. supplier in 1937 was Argentina with 28,000,000 lbs. , and China was second with 20,000,000 . Because of the Japanese war , China 's exports to the U. S. are now zero . Because of war in Europe , other suppliers of carpet wool have had their entire clip embargoed .
