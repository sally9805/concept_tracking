txt In spite of the generally low level of business during the third quarter , earnings of the ' anion Carbide &; Carbon Corp . for the period , which will be published shortly , were slightly larger than the $4,506,155. or 50 cents a share on 9 , - 000.743 shares of capital stock , reported for the second quarter . This gain is in line with the usual seasonal increase in profits shown by the company during the last half of the year , although the increase is less , of course , than it would be in a normal year . The fourth quarter in past years always has been the most profitable period of the year so that with more than $1.50 a share already earned in 1931 , it is probable that total net profit for this year will be in excess of $2 a share . This would compare with a nct profit of $28.041,425 , equal to $3.12 a share . earned in 1930 , and $35.427,024 , or $4.19 a share on 8. - 453,723 shares in 1929 . Business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carbide Co. , the National Carbon and Linde Air Products , has a high degree of stability . Sales of my-acetylene gall ' for cutting and welding have held up well as in oilier periods of business depression . A considerable amount of replacement business in carbon brushes , electrodes and equipment for dynamos , power plants and electric furnaces is being transacted . Eveready flashlights and batteries , being low priced goods , have maintained a fair volume . The new chemical division , while not as yet one of the major earning units , has transacted a considerably larger volume of business than last year . due to the fact that its products , which comprise a wide variety of synthetic chemicals for use in the textile trades , in lacquers and in chemistry , still are in the promo .. Lion stages . Many of them are used to improve industrial processes and lower costs , so that their use still is capable of expansion , even during a depression . Outlook Favorable for Synthetic Plastics The recent contract to supply Vinylite , the new synthetic plastic for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of this product . which has so , far been only in the pilot plant stage . no important increase in income can be looked for from this source for the time being , it ultimately may prove to be one of the major divisions of Carbide 's business . The new synthetic plastics seem certain to have a growing industrial use for molding articles of all sorts which can be stamped out , thus eliminating manual labor in tooling . The indicated earnings of $2 to $2.25 a share for 1931 will not cover Carbide 's annual dividend requirements of $2.60 a share . Carbide , however , probably still maintains a strong cash position although no balance sheet hair been published since the annual report for 1930 was issued . At the end of last year . call loans and marketable securities totaled $28,695.862 . This was the balance of the $$2.000,000 obtained by the sale of stock in 1929 to provide for expansion . In addition cash amounted to $16 - 979,503 , making total cash assets more than $45,000,000 . Part of the expansion program has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sum still is on hand . The future dividend policy of the management doubtless will depend upon the outlook for business an 1932.
