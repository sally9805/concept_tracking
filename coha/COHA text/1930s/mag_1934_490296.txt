MOST of the nutty things that go on in the world get into the newsreel From them the newsreel has built a curious philosophy . It sees life today as the thrilling struggle of Man to conquer the elements . Announcers refer to this constantly . Usually Man is seen battling the elements in some wholly grotesque pose , swinging by his teeth from the underside of a blimp or riding a motorcycle up the Tower of Pisa . Our own feeling , after some study of this concept , is that the struggle between Man and the elements is badly in need of a referee : Man already has the elements down and is kicking them in the stomach . NE of the effects of the recent de-pression , if we may use either of those words , has been to lower the age limit in men 's clubs . Several of the more impressive clubs have been letting in youngsters of thirty-five and thirty-six , to holster their exchequers . It is an embarrassing ordeal for the youths . We have a friend who has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is a chit of a boy in his thirty-third year , but he has cut all his teeth and can say a few words so they took him in over there . The tough thing is that he does n't dare lunch there without taking along somebody , his own age , as it makes him appear too much of a kid . Almost every day he invites our friend in to keep him company , and the two of them lunch solemnly among the greysters and set pieces . TOa youth in his thirties , member- ship in one of the deeply upholstered clubs is an exciting , not altogether carefree , adventure . If he takes three drinks in succession in the bar room , winks are passed around : the old members think he is going it a hit . To belong , one must as a rule he a hard-money child ; for although some of the clubs have been willing to stretch a point in the matter of age , none of them have been looking around for young inflationists .

When the day came and he finally found himself seated among the elders , he mentioned fly-fishing , hoping that it would strike a happy conversational note ; but it turned out that none of the committee had ever held a rod , and the meal went off in an austere and distinguished silence . THE radio , except as it serves mariners , is a decivilizing achievement . It has destroyed the illusion of distance , invaded the privacy of walled enclosures , and coated the tongue of music . With other amplified and allied sounds , indiscriminately disseminated , the radio will in time cause a tone deafness no less shameful than our lost sense of smell . Even the Penn Station is now radio equipped , like a common cab . We walked into the main hall the other afternoon to buy a ticket ; the place was a nasty smear of sound , a hemorrhage of tonality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the terminus . We felt immediately defenceless , uneasy , and cheap . No sound in music should be universal . Itmade us mad as hops to realize that " Marchetti " could he . and was being , heard in the place for which we were buying a ticket , the effect being to nullify the romance of the intervening miles and make our jnurney seem pointless and banal . AT sea the wireless has the concen-trated beneficence of the cup of brandy on a St. Bernard 's collar . Long ago we were handed a pair of earphones and allowed to listen to the high myste-rious pin-pricks of a faraway ship . They still tingle in our ears . But even marin-ers sometimes run afoul of modern ra-dio technique .

Economists are getting in their licks rather late ; the ministers have been at it for years . Every Monday morning , in the newspaper reports of yesterday 's sermons , one finds a complete inventory of peril . It used to be short skirts , until styles changed and skirts got longer . It used to he drink , until cocktails achieved a majority in the parish . We notice that those two peril hunters Clarence Darrow and John Haynes Holmes held a debate the other night on the subject " Can Civilization Be Saved ?

A lady 's voice answered and the reporter asked for Mrs. Roosevelt 's secretary . " I 'm sorry , " said the lady . " Mrs. Roosevelt 's secretary is n't in now , but this is Mrs. Roosevelt . May I take the message ? " The reporter asked what he wanted and Mrs. Roosevelt told him the answer . It only took a minute or two . Lecturer THIS is the Burton Holmes season again at Carnegie Hall .

We went to hear Holmes the other day , and the audience laughed softly during a sequence showing a flock of goats being driven through some Mediterranean town because one of the goats stopped and nibbled some shrubbery . The audiences have n't changed much , either . Holmes is a wiry little man who talks rapidly in a crisp voice which seems in harmony with his Vandyke heard . Curiously , the day we went to Carnegie Hall , about two out of five men in the audience had beards just like Holmes 's . In public , Holmes dresses conventicinally and meticulously .

AMISS RILEY , of Larchmont , has mailed us one of the announcements a theatre up there sent around to the townspeople last week : MAE WEST in " Pm No Angle " If hales ' THE Museum of Natural History A is quite excited about those two whales that came ashore at Edgemere , Queens , within three weeks of each other . It 's a very unusual thing . If the Museum 's preliminary findings are correct , they are both beaked whales ( Mesopludon Europria ) , very few of which have been seen in the Atlantic since the first one turned up in the English Channel in 1848 . And here Edgemere gets two , one on December 22nd and one on January 14th . The Museum wo n't be certain that the sec-ond is a beaked whale until intricate measurements of the skeleton are com-pleted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anthony , head of the De-partment of Mammals , thinks that the two were travelling together , possibly husband and wife . The second one was a female which had recently given birth , but the sex of the first has n't been settled yet . It was pretty well muti-lated when it got to the Museum . A plausible theory is that one of the whales was hit by a propeller nr injured itself on a rock or jetty , and that the second hung a-round in the vicinity un-til she was injured also . The first whale was dragged out of the water under the lead-ership of the Messrs . Gerald Closs and Henry Still . Mr. Closs was walking along the beach about five o'clock in the morning , look-ing for frostfish . In years gone by he has found many things on the beach , including fourteen cases of whiskey . Forty feet off shore he saw the whale lashing around . He went and woke up Henry , and the two came hack with knives , hip boots , and fifty feet or so of steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the whale , and after four or five tries managed to get a noose over the animal 's fruited tail , and then , with the aid of twenty-five men who had gathered on the beach , they hauled it ashore . They killed it by stabbing . The Museum , which spurns most things offered it , but is deeply interested in whales , heard about the capture from the police and borrowed the Aquarium 's big truck , thinking to bring the carcass in whole . It was too badly damaged , however Later , it was found to have ? a broken jaw and nose . The Museum crew cut the carcass up and brought it back in pieces , after stripping off much meat and blubber . They gave several large slabs of the meat to some Negroes who asked for it , and burned the blubber , which fired readily . The second whale beached itself , or was washed in dead , twelve blocks from where the first appeared . The Museum is going to put one of the skeletons in the Oceanic Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mammals has records of very few whales appearing in these waters . The Museum has a model of a pigmy sperm whale captured off Staten Island years ago , and the skeleton of a right whale that came ashore at Amagansett , Long Island , about 1906 . The pigmy is only ten or eleven feet long , although full-grown . The other measures forty-five feet . In 1928 a two-toothed whale came ashore near Montauk , and in that same year some fishermen towed a baby sperm into the Gowanus Canal . It was a few weeks old and measured nineteen feet That 's all the whales from local waters the Museum has had anything to do with . ? A LADY of Maryland who visits here often got around this week to visiting the Empire State Building tower . She had bought a ticket at the cashier 's desk when she saw a sign : " Visibility ? Fair .

" Why , that 's our second-hest visibility . " Diamond-Cutter IF the stories lately in the papers about the new discoveries in South Africa have made you diamond-conscious , you may he interested in knowing that Mr. J. Van I3erckelaer , although only thirty-eight , is said to be the best diamond-cutter in town . He inherited the exquisite knack , his father being the president of the diamond-cutters ' union . in Europe . The New York Van Berckelaer works as near the sky as he can get , in a building on West Fifty-seventh Street , for diamond-cutting requires all the light there is . He uses n lapidary wheel , which revolves so fast you do n't observe at first that it is moving . It may take anywhere from a few hours to several months to complete the cutting of a diamond . Depends on the grain . A diamond has a grain , just like wood , only it is invisible , and has to be located by feel , which always takes an expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two ago , Van Berckelaer worked on a diamond for four months off and on before he finished it . One gem firm had given the stone up as a bad job and sold it to another , which luckily had Mr. Van B. in its employ at the time . ( He 's since become a free-lance , independent cutter . ) In some stones , you ca n't ever find the grain  --  even Mr. Van Berckeke r ca n't . But he does n't miss on many . The run of the grain has to be at right angles to the cutting wheel if you 're really going to get anywhere . Also , you must watch for flaws . Flaws are sort of knots in the grain and you have to wiggle delicately around them . Sometimes Mr. Van B. spends weeks getting around a flaw . There are many other problems for the lapidary man : if you cut too deeply or too thinly , the stone loses its fire and is " dead . " Stones in which no grain can he found are used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points , etc . They 're called " working diamonds " as opposed to " patrician diamonds " and would , if sensate , feel very badly . One of Mr. Van B. 's specialties is handling odd-shaped stones that other cutters do n't know what to do with . He cuts them into triangles , hexagons , octagons , kite shapes , and other shapes that he works out . The conventional formula for a round stone , by the way , is fifty-eight facets . It 's a kind of rule , like nine innings in a hail game . You ca n't  --  even Mr. Van Berckelaer ca n't  --  cut a diamond into the shape of a horse or a cow or a sheep , so do n't go nagging him to . You got to stick to planes and angles . Mr. Van B. can , however , do very fancy things within reason . He can cut crystals for ladies ' watches out of diamonds . The diamond business has n't been much lately . Only a few lapidaries keep going steadily . Buying rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , suited to times of prosperity . Rough diamonds come here from Saudi Africa through London dealers . Cutters buy them in lots , knocking wood as they do so . A cutter once paid two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for a shipment from Angora , where a new diamond field had been discovered . On the lapidary wheel all the stones developed fibre flaws and split into nothing . Complete loss . Considerate OUR Vermont , man was down this week with an item . It 's about Mr. Porter Hartwell Adams , of that city , who seems to be eligible for consideration as the most thoughtful employer there is . He is head of the executive board of the National Aeronautic Association and has his office on his estate near Thetford , which is thoughtful to begin with . But his Big Deed is the presentation to his stenographer of Greta Garho 's chair . He was in California on a trip some time ago and , seeing Miss Garbo 's chair , in a motion-picture studio , arranged to buy it . He brought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " M-G-M Studios " painted on the front and " Miss Garbo " on the back . Our Thetford man checked up on all this  --  saw the chair , the girl , the employer . He asked the young lady how she liked sitting in Miss Garbo 's chair . " It 's sort of fun , " she told him . Then she let him try it , and he tells us it was sort of fun . Play Car SEVERAL people who have been able to Get Away have told us we ought to write something about the recreation cars the Atlantic Coast Line has put on its Florida Special , and one of them has given us a Inunan-interest story . The ACL considers the cars a success , we learn . They put one on as a weekly feature at the start of the season and new it 's a daily matter , with four cars in service , going and coming . Two of them , named Roney-Plaza and Key-Largo , are open for their full length , and the other two , Miami-Biltmore and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a gymnasium at the other , equipped with flying rings , a punching hag , pulleys , and an electric horse . In between is the dancing floor . Each car carries a hostess , a three-piece orchestra , and a porter . The hostesses are selected for their ability to get people to playing things . They 're always a Mrs. The Atlantic Coast Line believes that on a boat a woman is insulted if she is n't spoken to by a gentleman , and on a train she 's insulted if she is spoken to . So the hostess , shortly after the train leaves , goes through the cars getting acquainted with the passengers and inviting them back . Then she handles the introductions . Bridge is the most popular diversion ; dancing next  --  and it 's easier to dance on a train than it is to walk on one . The hostesses try to keep the bridge stakes down and to discourage poker . They wo n't supply poker chips , but if some gentlemen have brought their own along , they are allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got on the train at Miami with the intention of leaving it at Jacksonville that evening and taking a plane . They told the hostess they had urgent business in New York and did n't want to waste a minute . The hostess introduced them to two old ladies , one about seventy and the other about seventy-five , and the six of them played cut - in bridge all afternoon . When Jacksonville was reached , the gentlemen said they were having such a good time they 'd decided to stay on the train even if they did lose a few hours . The six started their bridge again next morning and played all day . During the morning , the hostess learned from a passenger that one of the gentlemen was Irving Bitz , named as the underworlder to act as go-between in the Lindbergh case , and that the others were his liegemen . She never whispered it to the old ladies .

Two hours passed by , in which questions were asked and answers given . Shuffling feet and nervous coughs betokened that the conference was sagging of its own weight , when one of the distillery men suddenly brightened everybody by reaching into a bulging briefcase and pulling out a bottle . " Have any of you men sampled our products ? " he asked . " I think you should . This is our best bourbon . " Fourteen pairs of eyes sparkled . " Has anyone a corkscrew ?
