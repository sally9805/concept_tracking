The title of the sombrest painter now alive , which is a considerable distinction , belongs by general consent to Georges Rouault . Born shortly after a shell knocked his mother out of bed during the Paris insurrection of 1871 , Rouault was first apprenticed to a maker of stained glass , later became the favorite pupil of the academic painter , Gustave Moreau . Since Moreau 's death in 1897 , pale , clerkish Georges Rouault has lived a mystic , melancholy life . Every day he goes to the little Moreau museum , of which he is curator , near the Gare St. Lazare , often lunches violently with his old friend , Ambroise Vollard , returns to a mysterious home to paint , in brutal black outline , with dark glowing reds and blues like medieval stained glass , figures of clowns and sufferers from his imagined ' ' legendary countries . " <P> This week this " monk of modern art ' ' was shown in a new aspect to the U. S. public when Manhattan 's Museum of Modern Art exhibited 150 lithographs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past 20 years . Many had not been shown anywhere before . Most were done at the instance of Vollard for that publisher 's fiercely faithful and interminably delayed de luxe editions . Several magnificent portraits were included : of Moreau , Verlaine , Baudelaire . In the color etchings art followers found new , bright colors , strange to Rouault , as if medieval gaiety were entering his medieval gloom . But the most impressive etchings were a series , Miserere et Guerre , in which Rouault 's myth-figures expressed the spiritual degradation and agony of War . Typical example : Homo Homini Lupus , " Man is a wolf to man " ( see cut p. 43 ) .
