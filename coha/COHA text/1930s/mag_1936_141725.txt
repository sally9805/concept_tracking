Last week the biggest , most serious maritime strike in U. S. history ran through its second week with all three coasts fretted by waterfront squalls and with peace negotiations slatting dismally in the doldrums . <P> On the Pacific , 150 ships , some 65,000 men were idle , but neither strikers nor shipowners would give an inch . So discouraged was Mediator Edward F. McGrady , Assistant Secretary of Labor , that he bought a ticket for Washington canceled it only on orders from Madam Secretary Perkins . At week 's end he felt somewhat better as both sides agreed to resume parleys , the strikers agreed to unload perishable goods . <P> On the Atlantic and Gulf , 151 ships and 16,000 men were idle , according to Strikeleader Joseph Curran . Shipowners and Madam Perkins joined in calling these figures " exaggerated , " but produced none of their own . Meanwhile , the three-cornered battle went on apace . Shipowners produced the old Red herring that the East Coast strikers were led by racketeering Communists . Using this as an excuse President John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seaman Curran because he began his striking career on an I. M. M. ship last spring ) requested New York City 's special prosecutor of racketeering , Thomas E. Dewey , to intervene . Prosecutor Dewey refused . <P> Stalwart allies of the shipowners , the officers of the orthodox East Coast maritime unions also joined in the cry of " Communism ! " Led by Negro Vice President David E. Grange of the International Seamen 's Union , they tried to provide crews for all ships vacated by Curran 's " outlaws . " Claiming that " the only ' outlaws ' in the present seamen 's strike are the I. S. U. officials , " Curran charged that Grange had failed to make a proper accounting of $143,000 in union funds , had constantly accepted fees from shipowners . Evidence of this was so strong that a New York Court ordered Grange and other I. S. U. officials to produce their books . <P> Meanwhile , in the harbor a few ships got away , many others remained strike-bound as the two seamen 's factions battled for control . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ship carrying Secretary of State Cordell Hull to Buenos Aires for the Pan- American Peace Conference . Most significant development was the shift of Eastern strikers from mere sympathy with Western strikers to identical active demands for themselves . <P> In Washington , President Roosevelt conferred with his Cabinet , then declined to intervene . Secretary Perkins declared that Mediator McGrady would yet solve the " regular " West Coast strike , dismissed the Eastern strike as that of a " rump organization . " Other highlights : <P> In Hawaii , 600 travelers were unable to continue because no U. S. ships were sailing . After loud protest from Governor Joseph B. Poindexter , Strikeleader Harry Lundeberg in San Francisco announced that all ships bound for the U. S. mainland could sail . In Honolulu , lettuce jumped from 5 to 25 a head , celery from $3.25 to $9.80 per case .
