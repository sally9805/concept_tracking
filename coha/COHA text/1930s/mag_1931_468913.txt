WE WERE discussing Anglo-American relations . " The trouble is , " the American was saying , " that our countries are represented to each other by the wrong people . You judge America by its tourists ; by the people who get drunk and overtip and shout round Paris as though they 'd bought the boulevards , while we judge England by the Englishmen who never having been to America say patronizing and supercilious things about her . Neither country is judged by what 's best and typical . if only more of the right people went across and stayed a while . " " I know , " I said , " but even when they do .. . " I had more than one concrete example in my mind when I said that . In the main , the Americans who come to England are tourists or internationalists . The tourists stay a few days , a few weeks , a few months even ; they travel from one town to another in cars and charabanes . They visit the Lake district , Oxford , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new landscape and old buildings . They make no attempt to mix in the country 's life . The internationalists , on the other hand ? the diplomats , prominent social personalities , dramatists , authors , publishers ? are as much at home in one country as in another . They have their roots not in a country but in a way of life . They arrive in Paris , Berlin , and London , pick up the receiver of a telephone , and are instantly a part of a world very similar to that which they had left on the other side of the Atlantic . But neither tourists nor internationalists are representative of the main current of a country 's life , nor are they regarded as representative . And the trouble would seem to be that those who are typical ? the foreign representatives of business houses , the men and women of good standing , but of insufficient social prominence to make their names familiar on both sides , who , for business reasons or of choice , make temporary homes in England ? as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unfortunate impressions . Practically the first American I came to know was the London agent of a . New York firm . lie had been brought by one of the members of our side to watch a football match I was playing in . I was at that time a member of Rosslyn Park . Every Saturday we played somewhere within a thirty-mile radius of Hyde Park . We fielded practically the same side each week . After the match those of us who had our evenings free would go on to Simpson 's or Devereux 's Oyster-bar and eat a steak , drink pints of luke- ' warm ale , and argue about the referee 's decision . They were cheery evenings . We were tired and stiff and bruised ; but till Monday morning we were out of training . The American came along with us . He was older than most of us , in the early thirties , but he mixed easily He was a jolly fellow , and we all liked him . It was the first time he had drunk draught beer . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " About all that you can say for this , " he said , " is that you can sit all evening drinking it and know that you 'll be able to find your way home all right . " Five hours later he placed a rather higher value on it ; it was fine , he said , and so was Rugby football , and so were we . He was coming to watch us every Saturday . Where were we playing next week ? he asked . Against the Harlequins at Twickenham , we told him . We were catching the 149 from Waterloo . " I 'll be right there , " he answered . We never expected that he would be . But when we gathered round the platform barrier , there he was , with his broad grin and immense high-collared coat . From the touch line he exhorted us vociferously . At the Devereux afterwards he accepted three " no heel-taps " challenges , after which he announced that this was the best time that he had had in weeks , and , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trounce the Exiles next Saturday at Orleans Park . He was there that Saturday , and the Saturday after he was christened the team 's mascot , and stoutly charged on no account to miss a match . With the England and Scotland match at Twickenham on the last Saturday in March the Rugby season ends . For the Londoner athletics is a pigeon-holed department . His game-friendships are confined to the playing field and the evening of the game . During the winter you rarely see the people you play cricket with , nor during the summer do you see your foot-ball friends . I did not see the team 's mascot again till the middle of September , when I went down to the old Deer Park for the trials and found him on the touch line . His smile and his coat collar were as vast as ever . " Hullo , Mascot , " I called out . " Not going to be your mascot much longer , " he called back . " In October I 'm going home . " There was not one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had added a great deal to the enjoyment of the season 's football . He would be much missed . " Well , anyhow , before you go , " we said , " you 'll have to come with us to a roast or boiled . " The " roast or boiled " is a feature of London football . An important club such as Rosslyn Park yields six or seven fifteens every Saturday . And as there is a danger of the members of the various sides losing touch with one another , once a month a private room is booked in a Fleet Street tavern , where for half a crown you can have your choice of boiled mutton or roast beef . Six or seven people from every side turn up . After the meal there is singing and a speech or two . To the mascot it was something completely new . " This is fine , " he said . " It almost makes me wish that I was n't sailing Thursday . " Opposite him was sitting a man from another side who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was a young and rather briefless barrister . He loved argument . His argument took the Socratic method of cross-examination . He had been at Oxford . His voice was slow and languid , his manner supercilious . To a foreigner who disliked England without knowing it very well he would have seemed typically English . " Indeed , " he said , " so you are returning to America . Now tell me you will be glad to be in America again . " " Naturally . " " You have not been happy here . " " Happyish . " " But not more than that . Now tell us what it was that made you dislike England . The climate or the English ? " " I did n't say I disliked England . " " You implied you did . Now tell us which was it that you disliked . " The mascot hesitated ; a hot , angry look had come into his eyes . " Come now , please tell us , " the barrister persisted . This time the answer came back pat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then . " " And what is it about the English that you particularly dislike ? " The barrister was actually quite a pleasant fellow . His cross-examination had begun in a friendly fashion . He had thought he was being good-naturedly amusing . He had not the suppleness of mind to realize that the mascot was being seriously annoyed . But even we , who realized and were waiting for the right moment to intervene , were unprepared for the suddenness of the mascot 's answer . " What do I particularly dislike about the English ? " he retorted . " Well , I 'll tell you . I dislike their standoffishness , their snobbery , their conceit . I dislike them for being envious of the United States and , instead of admitting it , pretending to despise Americans . I dislike them most of all for the way they behave to the foreigners who come to England , not of their choice , but in the interests of trade , interests that are England 's as much as they are America 's . There are a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those will do to carry on with . " It was said so loudly that no one in the room could fail to hear it . Before he had spoken two sentences there was silence down the length of the two other tables . There were thirty seconds of complete stillness when he finished . Then on all sides a rattle of talk broke out , and we were all busy pretending that nothing had ever happened . For most of us it spoiled the evening . For the mascot it did , most certainly . " I ca n't think how I can have done it , " he said . " Perhaps I 'd been drinking . I do n't know , but the fellow just maddened me somehow . My word , but I feel bad about it , after all the fun I 've had with you fellows . " We assured him it did not matter , that no one would think twice about it . But even now , after nine years , the incident is remembered in the club . " Ca n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , " grumbled people from other teams . " Could n't he see a joke ? Why must these Americans be so damned touchy ? They think everyone 's envying them and everyone 's criticizing them ; and they get mad if you do n't flatter them . " " This fellow was n't like that , " we said . " He was a first-class fellow . " But the others , the majority , were unconvinced . And we who knew him and were fond of him were puzzled over his behavior . I was to remain puzzled till a conversation I had a few years later when I was returning from my first visit to the States . At the same table as myself was a New York merchant on his way to supervise the Paris branch of his business . For the preceding year he had occupied a similar post in London . He did not seem too pleased . " Though at that , " he said , " it ca n't be any worse than London . " He was a man in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an easy , friendly smile . " You did n't like it there ? " I asked . " Like it ! " he said . " I had heard people talk of loneliness , but I just did n't know what it was like till I went to London . " He paused , then quietly , without any animosity , continued , " I guess London has n't any use for foreigners . I went there knowing scarcely anyone but , as I was going into a London business house , I imagined that my colleagues would take care of me . You 've been in New York long enough to know what happens to a stranger when he arrives there . You 're a writer ; well , I suppose that your publishers and agents made you a temporary member of their clubs . They had a party or two for you . They introduced you to people . And every now and then they 'd ring you up to see how things were going . I imagined that it would be the same in London . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was welcomed with great cordiality . I 've nothing to complain of there . The chairman of the company could n't have been nicer . He was delighted to have me over ; he said we must get to know each other . What day would I have lunch with him ? " He gave me a very good lunch . He took me to his club . He was a charming and considerate host . I enjoyed myself no end . I was at the beginning of a real friendship , I told myself . But was P Was I , hell ! From that day on during the whole of the year I spent in London he did nothing for me , not one thing . He was very courteous , very amiable . Such business discussions as we had could not have been friendlier . At the end of them he would always say , " Well , how are things going ? Settling down all right ? " And " Sure I am , " I 'd answer . But I 'd like to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . How in hell 's name did he expect me to settle down in a city where I did n't know a soul , and saw no way of knowing one ? I had a letter or two of introduction , but they did n't help me much . The people I sent them to asked me to lunch or dinner . Then after a while I asked them back , and there , more or less , it ended . Before I left I had got to know , one way or another , enough people to keep about half my evenings full , but I 'll never forget the loneliness of my first six months . " As far as I could make out , " he concluded , " the English are self-contained ; they 've found a way of life that suits themselves , and they just ca n't be bothered over foreigners . " He was , I should have said , a typical representative of the upper middle class , and it is , I suppose in any country , the upper middle class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact , the kind of person that an Englishman would soonest hear speak well of England , and of whom an American would , I imagine , say , " Well , if you want to judge America , that 's the type that you should judge it by . " And though I had no means of judging what kind of memories he had left behind him , there could be no doubt of the memories he had taken with him . It was in the light of that talk that I suddenly understood the mascot 's sharp outburst at the roast or boiled ; visualized , too , the whole course of his life in London that had led up to it . I was at the moment just finishing a world tour . I had known what it was during its course to be lonely in strange places , had known , too , the feeling of unreasoning resentment against the pleasures from which you are excluded . You sit in a hotel lounge . You have spoken to uo one but servants for three days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four days that must elapse before the sailing of your boat . You know no one . There is no way of getting to know anyone . And on all sides of you there are people laughing and chatting together . You hate them for being happy and for having friends . In view of that and of what the American had told me , I could picture the mascot 's life : his loneliness , the resentment against the apparent self-sufficiency of English life which made him lonely , the pathetic readiness to join the group of footballers who offered him an escape from loneliness , and his sudden outburst against a type who had seemed to represent everything in English life that had made his stay in London wretched . A representative American had gone back to the States with the prayer that he need never return and had left a number of people saying , " Well , if that 's a typical American , and as likely as not it is , no , thank you . " It had been a pathetic misunderstanding . For it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do they resent foreigners ; it is simply that the fabric of our social life is arrayed differently from that of other cities . I was born in London . My home is in London . I have spent the greater part of my life in London , but even so I find it difficult to explain what it is that makes London different from other cities . People may say that it is a matter of cliques . But it is not that so much , I think , as that the Londoner more than other townsmen arranges his life in a series of pigeon-holes . Only about a tenth of one 's friends know one another . My best and oldest friend , for instance , was born within a few yards and a few hours of me . We went to the same house in the same school , we belonged to the same club , we played football and play cricket for the same side . Our tastes and our positions in life are much the same . We meet on an average three times a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London we have never met each other unexpectedly in any restaurant , party , or theater . Weknow each other as well as any two men can know each other , but when we ring up to arrange some meeting and find that we have no evening free for a week , we have no idea what the other is doing during those six intervening days . A Londoner 's life is a very intricate mosaic of relationships . It is conducted almost entirely in private houses . There is no equivalent for the country-club atmosphere , no central place where one meets all one 's friends to which one could introduce a new friend , confident that he or she would be looked after . Everything is pigeonholed . It would not occur to the Londoner to move from their separate pigeon-holes the people he plays games with , the people that he does business with , and those whom he meets at some quarterly or monthly dining club . It is the fact of this pigeon-holing of one 's acquaintance , this leaving and being left to one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and satisfactorily personal . But it is that same fact that can make London for the stranger ? since London has not , as Paris has , an exhibition side , since its entertainment is confined to clubs and private houses ? the loneliest city in the world . There was always a danger , I supposed , of any foreigner having a thin time in London . And so a couple of years later , when a girl of whom I had seen a good deal when I was visiting in California , wrote to tell me that she was coming over alone to stay in London , I felt tempted to discourage her . Shc was called Joan Jordan . She was twenty-two years old , with frank , hazel eyes , an open smile , a sunny nature , and a direct , straightforward manner that put you instantly at your case . Her letter to me bore a Paris postmark . She had it all planned out . She had come over with a party , but she was going to leave the party behind her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly as a Londoner for a year , mixing with Londoners , leading a Londoner 's life . I could not help receiving the plan with some misgivings ; though her father was a person of prominence in Pasadena , his name would convey little if anything to Londoners . She had , of course , a certain number of links among us . But I could picture what might happen when she arrived . The women who had known her in America on learning that she was in London would get in touch with her , invite her to dinner , give her an amusing evening , tell her that they were at home on Sunday afternoons , though it would be well to ring up first , include her name in their list for cocktail parties , and leave it there . I should give some parties for her and ask to them the people I thought she would be most likely to get on well with But though Londoners may say the first time they meet you , " Do look me up sometime , " they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till a third or fourth meeting that they do anything definite . And even those whom I should particularly ask to " do something about " Joan , would not , I fancied , do much more to begin with than take her address and remark that they would be having a small party soon and would let her know when and where . To enjoy London one needs four friends and forty acquaintances . Probably one does in any city . But in London the collecting of them takes a full six months . I was very afraid that for those six months Joan would find herself extremely lonely . When she rang up to tell me that she would be coming across in two days ' time , I did what I could to warn her . " London 's a funny place , " I began to say . " You may not like it . " But she was not of the kind that readily accepts advice . " If that happens , " she said , " I 'll catch the next liner for San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her capacity to run her life that is one of the greatest attractions of American women . " Oh , well , " I thought , " it may go better than I expect . " A month later it certainly seemed so . She took , within a week of her arrival , and for a year , a pleasant furnished house in Chelsea . After the first fortnight , during which Joan and I saw each other most days at some time or other , I began to notice that as often as not when I rang her up with some suggestion she already had another engagement . " You seem to be pretty busy nowadays , " I said . " Oh , yes , I 'm beginning to find my feet . " I was curious to know with whom she was spending her time . " Who are all these people , " I asked , " that you 're running round with ? " " Oh , I do n't know . No one in particular . Just chaps . " " But where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's a funny thing , " she said , " but do you remember that evening we went to the Green Lizard ? I believe that I 've met directly and indirectly more people through that one evening than at any other time since I 've been here . " I remembered it very well . It had been a jolly evening . The Green Lizard is , as night clubs go , about as good a thing as London can produce in a Bohemian way . It is small , clean , and inexpensive . It has a fair cabaret . One usually found somebody amusing there . On this occasion we had been greeted boisterously by a genial young man who had been at Oxford with my brother and whom I had met since intermittently . " Come and sit at our table , " he shouted . His table was already crowded , but we managed to find places at it . " I do n't know half of our names , " he said . " You can introduce yourselves to one another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fairly gay . There was dancing , and every now and then someone would sing a song . At twelve a wine waiter came round to take final orders . At twenty-five minutes past twelve he asked us to finish up our drinks . At twenty-five to one he swept away the glasses . The young man from Oxford sighed . " I 'm not sure that things are n't better in New York , " he said . " At any rate , once you 're inside a speakeasy you can drink till morning . I suppose there 's nothing for it but to go sadly home . " " Unless , " Joan suggested , " you all come back and have some drinks with me . " She made the offer in the same casual , open-hearted way that her father would have done after golf at the country club in Pasadena . And some thought it would be a good idea ; and some said they lived a long way out . The young man from Oxford murmured something about his work , but in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . I did not know by name or sight either of the other two . They seemed pleasant enough , and we sat in Joan 's home , played the gramophone , drank some whiskey , and at about two o'clock scattered to our various homes . " Everything seemed to start from that evening , " Joan explained . " One of the boys rang up next morning and asked if he could call . " " Which one ? The one I knew ? " " No , one of the others . And we went to the Green Lizard . I got made a member ; there were some people there he knew . A few of them came back afterwards , like the other night . And , oh , well , one thing leads to another . I 'm going to have a party as soon as I 'm properly moved in . " It was a curious party . The stage-management of it was admirable . So admirable , indeed , that had Joan been a less nice person it would have seemed pretentious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed natural to be drinking champagne at tea-time with trays of caviare and smoked-salmon sandwiches tittering every table . It had been billed as a cocktail party . But at about eight o'clock cold pies , salads , and trifles began to replace the caviare sandwiches . We found ourselves picnicking on the floor . Later there was dancing . I left at about one . The party ended , I believe , at four . It was great fun . At the same time I had never before been to a party where there was quite that atmosphere . There were two or three of my own friends whom I had introduced to Joan . There were three or four rather dowdy , middle-aged women but , for the most part , the party was composed of well-dressed young men wearing familiar ties that one felt one ought to know but did n't . Yet it was not so much the company as a feeling of uncertainty as though nobody knew what he or anyone else was doing there that gave the party its unusual atmosphere . One scrap of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who is she , anyhow ? " I heard one man say . " Some rich American having a good time , " was the answer . Only Joan herself seemed completely self-assured . She moved graciously and calmly from group to group . " It was a funny party , was n't it ? " she said to me next day . " I knew so few of the people when it began , and I liked them all so much by the time that it was over . " " Knew so few of them ? " " Well , I knew about half , I guess . " " How did the others get in , then ? " " The usual way . By people ringing up and asking if they could bring friends with them . So , of course , said , ' Yes . ' I think London 's such fuu that way . I thought London would be stiff and awkward . But it is n't at all . I came here knowing practically no one . Now I find that I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in . " III I saw little of her during the next month . I was in the country the greater part of the time , finishing a book . I was planning as soon as it was done to sail for Zanzibar . Whenever I saw Joan she seemed supremely happy , brimming over with the excitement of a new experience . Her talk was full of the plays and places she had been to . " Joan seems to be having a good time over here , " I wrote to a mutual friend in California . " Though of what that good time consists I am a little puzzled . " I might have guessed a little from a remark she made shortly before I sailed . " I 'm thinking of financing a cocktail club , " she said . " Do you think it a good idea ? " " Only if you 've some money you want to lose . " " I have n't . " " Then I 'd keep dear of it . " " Why do you say that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club . " " There 's room for another . " I shook my head . A cocktail club is of service only to members of a moneyed and leisured class . In the lives of the average occupied person it would be an unnecessary extravagance . " The Five Hundred Club , " I said , " has got all the pleasant people who feel the need for that kind of club . The people who would want another club are not the kind you 'd like to be mixed up with . " " I do n't know what you mean by that . A lot of my friends say that they 'd like to join a club if one was started . " She answered snappily and changed the subject promptly . It was her weakness , as it was her strength , that she neither invited advice nor welcomed it . But from that moment I should have guessed what manner of world she was frequenting . Every country produces its own brand of waster , England 's particular brand has conic of a good family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an unearned income , and no guts . He sponges upon his friends , accepts dinners and gifts from middle-aged women , has an inferiority complex about his worth which he conceals behind a patrician air of superiority . His own class sees through him at the second meeting and has no use for him . He is forced to play the Triton among minnows . It is to this class that the type of person who would be anxious to join a cocktail club and would not be a member of the Five Hundred would belong . Galsworthy has described this type , at its worst , in Swan Song . And it is a type very well calculated to impress a foreigner for a little while . Except for that one party , I had seen Joan in my setting , not in hers . I imagined that the fullness of her days meant simply that her other friends had been more accommodating than I had expected them to be . Before I left for Zanzibar I gave a couple of farewell parties to which she came . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met her for the third or fourth time , were exchanging telephone numbers with her . From Marseilles I wrote to a couple of them , asking them to keep an eye on her . I was away three months , during which time I had no fixed address . A large mail was awaiting my return to Villefranche . There was a letter among others from one of the women I had asked to keep an eye on Joan . " I have seen your American friend once or twice , " she wrote , " but , really , it was not easy . I asked her to a cocktail party , and she brought a quite impossible person with her . I went to her house and it was too pathetic . You never saw such an appalling crowd of third-rate men and rotten women . They were all out for what they could get out of her . I felt sorry for her . She 's nice ; but the trouble is that one ca n't see her without getting involved with the most impossible people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a note from Janet . " I 've done my best for your young friend , " she wrote , " but there are limits . I went to a party of hers where a quite awful person made extraordinary suggestions within two minutes of meeting me . I am afraid that I have no patience with the type of American who thinks she can get away with anything provided she serves champagne . " In London there were no two opinions about her ; one or two people were sorry for her ; but such reasonable persons as knew her were agreed that they could not waste their time on her . Several felt that she was simply a cheap person who thought everything was for sale . " She 's pretty , of course , and amusing , " someone said , " but she must be shoddy , or she could n't go about with such shoddy people . " " I can assure you she is n't that , " I answered . But I saw the impossibility of convincing anybody Before Joan came I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on terms of intimacy with the kind of Londoners she would care to know . I had fancied she might be lonely . But I had not realized that there is at hand an accessible and deceptive world which is very ready to take advantage of an inexperienced and moneyed foreigner , and that by making use in London of the social technic with which in her own world she was familiar , she would get herself involved with it . For the social technic that is suitable to one town and country may be fatal in another . In California Joan had seen her father and her friends inviting to their house the people that they met in clubs . And in London , in the same spirit , she had taken back to her home the people she had met at the Green Lizard . As a result , she had become involved with the very people against whom Londoners erect their self-protective barrier of reserve ; and so by the time she had got on to terms of intimacy with the Londoners with whom she was by birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her part in another world , to be accepted by them . It was a pathetic muddle . I wondered how much she had realized it herself . Sooner or later she would do so , I knew . For she had too much good sense and too much natural decency to tolerate permanently a shoddy milieu . How much she had realized it I had little means of knowing . I was on my way through to New York , spending only three days in London . It was Easter , and Joan was out of town for the week-end . Lunch the day before I sailed was all that we could arrange . She looked tired and depressed . " Well , " I said . " How 's life ? " " Fine ! " she answered . But she did not give the impression that it was . And it was of America , not of London , that she wanted to talk . " When I heard you were sailing I felt just heartbroken with envy . You 'll give my love to them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But I thought you 'd taken that house for a year ? " She shrugged her shoulders . " I 've been away from home over a year . That 's a long time . I do n't want to become depaysee . " Which was as much as she , who would never admit to a mistake , would say about her experiment of taking a home in London . One other remark only did she make . " ' That friend of yours , Janet Carter ? a bit of a snob , is n't she ? " she asked . " I do n't think so , " I answered . " Nothing much , except that she said that she was surprised to see a person like Teddy Wale at my house ? when you think how pleased she 'd be herself to be entertained by my people if she came out West . " That was all she said . Two months later , however , in California , I read the letter to a mutual friend in which she announced her intention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it here , " she said . " It was fun to start with , but it 's like breathing stale air . I 'm tired of people who do nothing themselves , who spend their time talking about what their parents did , who despise everything that is new and everyone who 's working . I want to be among people who are looking forward , not looking backward ; and the snobbery of it all sickens me . " I made no comment . There seemed none to make . I thought of the pathos of this misunderstanding , of the impression that this girl had taken away with her of England , and the impression that she had left behind her there . She , who of all people in the world should have left and taken away with her happy memories . And it was of her I thought , of her and of the mascot , and the New York merchant I had met on the Aquitania , and of the similar incidents that are at the hack of people 's minds when you hear Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quoting in defense of this disparagement some example that , though scarcely typical in itself , completes the sum of what is typical ; of all that I thought , as I sat on the boat discussing " Anglo-American " relations with an American . " No , " I said , " I do n't believe that we misunderstand each other because the wrong people represent us to each other , but because the right people on both sides do n't make the right kind of allowances . " On the surface our two worlds are similar , and so we do n't recognize and take account of the vast , though not immediately apparent differences . The Englishman going to America or the American going to England is not prepared for those inelasticities of the social fabric that in the case of completely foreign nations he is invariably on the watch for . He does n't take the trouble to feel his way . As a result he takes and makes a wrong impression . " We misunderstand each other , " I said , " in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
