txt The Board of Estimate enacted into local legislation yesterday two major provisions of the Economy Bill which are expected to reduce substantially the city 's budget deficit and enable it to qualify for about $140,000,000 in pending Fedi eral loans . Swinging into action shortly after Governor Lehman had signed the , city bill , the board convened in special meeting at City Hall at 3:20 . After a brief session it adjourned and considered the two resolutions offered by the Mayor in an executive session of the Committee of the Whole . Emerging an hour later , the members reconvened as the Board of Estimate , and within ten minutes the two resolutions were adopted . N-Vbile the economy machinery was put in motion Controller Cunningham sold to a banking syndicate $7,650,000 of 4 per cent special revenue bonds . The interest cost to the city will be per cent , the lowest rate obtained by the city since 1931 . Public reaction to the passage of the legislation at Albany was reported to be so ? favorable that the bankers immediately offered the securities for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pave the way for the flotation soon of $75,000,000 in long-term corporate stock . One of the two resolutions adopted by unanimous vote of the board provides for payless furloughs beginning on June 30 of this year . The furloughs are to be completed with t he payroll of Nov. 30 , 1934 Deputy Controller Joseph estimated that the city would save $11,000,000 by furloughs . The furlough provision applies to all city employes paid from the city treasury who earn $1,200 a year or more , excepting the judges , justices and surrogates specifically exempted by the Economy Bill , and employes of the Board of Education and Board of Higher Education likewise exempted . To Use Vacation Periods . As far as possible , furloughs will be given within the regular vacation period . They range from seven days ' furlough for employes earning between $1,201 and $1,500 to furloughs of one month for those earning $6,001 and over . The great majority of city employes who earn between $2,501 and $3,000 will receive a payless furlough of fifteen days , which in effect amounts to a 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 2 per cent pay reduction through the furlough , while the highest grades get an 81-3 per cent cut . The terms of the resolution apply to such employes who receive salary and maintenance from the city , with the stipulation that the total compensation of such individuals shall be deemed their salaries plus 50 per cent of the salaries . In no case will payless furloughs affect the pension or retirement rights of employes who are members of pension and retirement systems . The city 's contributions to these systems will be continued at the present level . The second resolution , adopted by unanimous vote of the board , applies payless furloughs and salary reductions to all county offices except those of the District Attorneys . Mayor LaGuardia expects the District Attorneys to make proportionate reductions in their offices , though they have fought any cut on the ground that it would handicap the fight against crime . Within six days the county officers are required to submit to the Board of Estimate revised estimates of their budgets for 1934 . The resolution provides that these budgets shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deputy Controller said that the 10 per cent cuts include payless furloughs , salary reductions and the elimination of positions . He estimated that about 6 per cent of the 10 would be saved by salary cuts and the remaining 4 per cent from payless furloughs . For example , a county office whose budget is $100,000 this year would be required to pare its budget by $10,000 . Of this amount $4,000 would be gained through payless furloughs and $6,000 by pay cuts and job eliminations . This part of the Economy Bill falls far short of giving the Mayor the sweeping power to eliminate jobs that he sought . He , however , considers it the best legislation that could be obtained from the Legislature under current conditions . Copies of the resolution affecting county offices were dispatched immediately to the various county agencies , to allow sufficient time for them to turn in theft ' revised budget estimates . Although representatives of the civil service groups made a protracted fight against the bill in Albany , not one of them appeared as a speaker at yesterday 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed doors , and there would have been little opportunity for any one to speak during the brief public session . Mayor LaGuardia said another special meeting of the Board of Estimate would be held today , immediately after the session of the Committee on Assessments . At today 's session the board expects to pass additional resolutions in line with other provisions of the bill . The Mayor explained yesterday that the board could act only on those provisions of the bill which were sure to be unchanged . It was considered likely that payless furloughs for school teachers and other educational employes would be sougEht by the Mayor in about the same proportions as those already imposed on other municipal employes . The furlough power over employes of the Board of Education , however , rests with the Board of Education under the bill . One secretary of the Board of Estimate who has served through previous administrations was astonished at the rapidity of yesterday 's session . " Whew ! " he said . " The *ink is hardly dry on that bill in Albany and here they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policeman on post near City Hall took careful notes on the furlough provisions from friendly newspaper men . " The boys in the station house are kinds interested in this , " he said . " I 'll tell them all about it ' when I go off post . " Generally , city employes were reconciled to the necessity of taking either a pay cut or a payless furlough . In the last several months they have come to feel that it was more or less inevitable . and even though they struggled against it in Albany they were inclined to accept it philosophically yesterday .
