txt The Late Francis Jones . To the Editor of The New York Times : The death of Francis Jones on May 28 , 1932 , produced no adequate notices of his career and personality . This was doubtless due to the fact that other officers of the National Academy and his closest friends were away from New York and not able to pay that homage which otherwise they would have grasped eagerly as a privilege . No one in my memory has won and held to a higher degree such spontaneous affection and devoted friendship . This quality had back of it many decades of loyal and intelligent service to art in America . His counsel was widely sought . To his confreres he proved himself a real and exceptional personage In his long and fruitful life . He worked constructively , through all his days , for the betterment and advancement of American art and artists . He was almost revered by his contemporaries , even those whose aims in art expression were opposed to his own , for his marked unselfishness and willingness to expend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His sane judgment and genial spirit will be sorely missed , and also his wise counsel , in our present difficult times of many conflicting influences . - FRED'K BALLARD WILLIAMS . New York , June 3 , 1932.
