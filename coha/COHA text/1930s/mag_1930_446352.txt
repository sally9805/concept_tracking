FROM the letters we have thus far published it is obvious that Harriet had no desire to accept the new situation which Shelley pressed upon her . With her hope of getting him back , she was well advised to delay the execution of deeds settling money on her which would confirm her acceptance of a separation . Shelley , meanwhile , felt keenly the contumely of those who ignorantly thought that he was deserting Harriet and cutting off his supplies of money to her . During the next few days , September 16-26 , we find affairs taking on a new aspect . In a letter which has disappeared , Shelley urged Harriet to decide how much of his income she expected to be settled on her . Before replying , she went to Shelley 's solicitor Amory , and divulged all the details of the plan of separation . What advantage she hoped to gain by this is not clear ; but it is plain from her husband 's next letter that by her act she had broken a promise to him and injured his immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Shelley in the courts . At the same time , her bitterness was such that she began to extend the blame , hitherto confined to Shelley and Mary , to Mary 's father , Godwin . There is something pitifully crass in Harriet 's miserable attempt to incriminate Godwin , who sympathized with her and stigmatized Shelley 's behavior as wicked and licentious . She spread the evil report that he had sold Mary to Shelley for a substantial sum ; and then , to see what he would say , visited Godwin and told him what was being said of him , with the assurance that she did n't believe a word of it . Shelley was indignant . His next letter is perhaps the sharpest that he ever wrote to Harriet : ? D. LETTER NUMBER 5 56 MARGARET STREET Sept ' : 26 , 1814 You abruptly closed all communication with me . You left unanswered the questions which I urged to you on the subject of money . This I should have attributed perhaps to carelessness on the subject had I not received information of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place , I find that you have detailed the circumstances of our separation to Amory , in opposition to your own agreement with me , in contradiction to your own sense of right , and with the most perfect contempt for my safety or comfort . He , as you foresaw , has determined to resign the affairs of mine that were on the point of completion . In the second place , I learn that Miss Westbrook told MY Edward Hookham that it was the intention of your father to take legal steps in consequence of my conduct . In this proceeding , if it be indeed true that your perversity has reached this excess , you destroy your own designs . The memory of our former kindness , the hope that you might still not be utterly lost to virtue and generosity would influence me , even now , to concede far more than the law will MS. earlessness force . If after you receive this letter you persist in appealing to the law , it is obvious that I can no longer consider you but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendship and affection has acted a part of the basest and blackest treachery . If Miss Westbrook has spoken falsely , I beg you to pardon me . I would not willingly occasion you the slightest pain . I was an idiot to expect greatness or generosity from you , that when an occasion of the sublimest virtue occurred , you would fail to play a part of mean and despicable selfishness . The pure and liberal principles of which you used to boast that you were a disciple , served only for display . In your heart it seems you were always enslaved to the vilest superstitions , or ready to accept their support for your own narrow and worldly views . You are plainly lost to me for ever . I foresee no probability of change . The subject of money alone remains ; I request you to inform me of your expectations on this head . But for the information I have received , I should have relied on your confidence that I would scrupulously transmit you a portion of whatever sums came into my possession . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to injure an innocent man struggling with distress . You have asserted to various persons that Godwin favored my passion for his Daughter . This , Harriet , you know to be most false . It is wanton cruelty and injustice to circulate this report . If you can represent your conduct to me in a more favorable light than I now behold it , I shall rejoice . P. B. SHELLEY This rebuke stung Harriet out of her silence . She labored to justify her conduct : she had gone to the lawyer only for advice , and did not intend to prosecute her husband . She reiterated her ignorant conviction that Godwin had acted the pander to his daughter and Shelley , and took this opportunity of again telling the latter what she thought of his mistress . A quicker means of losing Shelley 's affection and of lowering herself in his opinion it would be hard to find ; and Shelley 's rejoinder shows that he despaired of maintaining their friendship . E. LETTER NUMBER 6 56 MARGARET STREET Sept. 27 , 1814 I rejoice at least to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should restore you to philosophy and to my friendship , I shall have additional occasion of satisfaction . Of this I foresee no hope . It remains for you to collect the best resources of your judgment , that you may communicate to me your final determinations , your principles and your views . If thro ' your prejudices and delusions it is impossible that we can sympathize , at least let me have that information from you , which will prevent any scheme that I may devise for your advantage from proving injurious to your plan of life . I recommended you to apply to an attorney in case you had lost all confidence in me . You have applied to an attorney : the consequence is obvious ? you are plainly lost to me , lost to the principles which are the guide and hope of my life . You say that you have employed an attorney , but that you intend to take no legal measures . This is itself a legal measure . Wherefore not let Hookham , or any common friend , be the arbiter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain to you my resources , my powers , my intentions . I repeat that I consider this application as an act of determined hostility . I desire to renew no intercourse of whatsoever nature with you , whilst you act under the principles which you recently avowed : these you were formerly the foremost , to stigmatize and abhor . A common love for all that the world detests was once the bond of union between us . This you have been the first to break : and you have lost a friend whom you will with difficulty replace . Your contumelious language toward Mary is equally impotent and mean . You appeal to the vilest superstitions of the most ignorant and slavish of mankind . I consider it an insult that you address such cant to me. 168 SHELLEY 'S LOST LETTERS TO HARRIET Harriet , if you still continued what I once hoped you would never cease to be , if you deserved my affection , with what eagerness would I devote myself to your pleasure ! Desert the selfish and the worldly wretches with whom you seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be your friend , not in the vulgar sense of friend , but in the most emphatic meaning of the word . I address these exhortations to you without the slightest 1 hope that they will make the least impression . You are plainly lost to me . With respect to Godwin you are mistaken , or you deceive yourself . Godwin refuses with bitter invective and keen injustice all further communication with me . Whatever proofs you have , as you value whatever good opinion of you your narrow conduct has yet left in my breast , send them without delay . If you feel yet any ambition to be ranked among the wise and good , write to me . I am hardly anxious however to hear from you , as I despair 2 of any generosity or virtue on your part . How happy should I be if I have done you injustice . P. B. SHELLEY Address me at Hookham 's . I am unable to raise money yet . I have not a farthing for myself . If therefore your resources are exhausted , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter . This letter was written just before Shelley and Mary changed their London lodgings from Margaret Street , Cavendish Square , to 5 Church Terrace , St. Pancras , in the much meaner and obscurer district of Somers Town . Need for rigid economy and a safer hiding place from bailiffs dictated the move . Mary 's entries in the Journal are laconic : Monday , September 26 . Shelley goes with Peacock to Ballachy 's , and engages lodgings at Pancras . Visit from Mrs. Pringer . Read Political Justice and the Empire of the Nairs . Tuesday , September 27 . Read Political Justice ; finish the Nairs ; pack up and go to our lodgings in Somers Town . II The next letter is without a date . Apparently it was written on or about October 3 , in answer to fresh complaints from Harriet . She has taken a new line of attack , somewhat as follows : Though Shelley has deserted his wife , he basely tries to keep his hold over her by reminding her of all the money he has spent for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in his reply , though manifestly once more disappointed in Harriet , Shelley merely appeals to her knowledge of his character to dispel these vulgar fancies . To her renewed harping on the wrong he has done her , he answers that he intended no injury , and that what has happened was inevitable . Cold comfort for poor Harriet ! Yet in a postscript he becomes , again the solicitous husband . Her advanced pregnancy demands that she take good care of her health ; but she must be cheerful , and confident of the event . Then , ? she still retains his books and part of his wardrobe , ? might he have stockings , ' hanks , ' and Mrs. Wollstonecraft 's posthumous works ? F. LETTER NUMBER 3 ? October 3 , 1814j Harriet , you mistake ? you obstinately mistake me . I never stated that I had conferred pecuniary benefits on you or that I derived from such sources a claim to your confidence and regard . I had hoped that the more substantial benefits of intellectual improvement , and the constant watchfulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would not have been degraded by so mean and common a mistake . I perceive that your irritated feelings have led you into this injustice towards me . If my friendship is thus rejected , I cherish little hope of any advantage arising to either of us from our intercourse . I was deeply solicitous that what has taken place should have been avoided : that although united to one perfectly adapted to my nature by a lasting and intense affection , you should have perceived that I continued to be mindful of your happiness , that I would have superintended the progress of your mind , and have assisted you in cultivating an elevated philosophy , to which without the interest I have taken in your improvement , it is probable that you never would have aspired . If you inflexibly resist these advances of kindness , if in return for my intentions you overwhelm me with contumely and reproach , what hope remains of a favorable issue to my ill-requited attempts ? I am united to another ; you are no longer my wife . Perhaps I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in having commenced any connexion with you . That injury , whatever be its amount , was not to be avoided . If ever in any degree there was sympathy in our feelings and opinions , wherefore deprive ourselves in future of the satisfaction which may result , by this contemptible cavil , these unworthy bickerings ? Unless a sincere confidence be accorded by you to my undesigning truth , our intercourse for the present must be discontinued . You derive more pain than advantage from the irritations produced by my visits . The interest which I take in you is disturbed by no feelings which prevent me from calmly calculating on your happiness . Collect yourself , I entreat you : remember what I am ; recall your recollections of my character . The hint respecting my duty to settle the property on you which your letter contains proves how little you can appreciate it . You have little need to fear that I shall fail in real duty . Affectionately yours P. B. SHELLEY I hope that you will attend to the preservation of your health . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think you may safely repose con fidence in Sims 's skill . Your last labour was painful , but auspicious . I understand that cases of difficulty after that are very rare . My dear Harriett , I am anxious for your answer . You must not do me injustice . Injustice you have done , so I expect you to repair it . I see Hookham to night . I am in want of stockings , hanks and Mr ? W 's posthumous works . I can not keep the engagement made at 3 tomorrow . I hear that my personal safety would be endangered by appearing there . Will you inform me where I can call upon the persons ? Something , either the tone of this letter or a temporary return of her usual good nature , made Harriet 's next communication more conciliatory . Shelley 's indignant words could not have been pleasant to digest , and she had no desire utterly to lose his good opinion . Her milder missive was received on October 5 , for which day Mary records in the Journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nangis and sail fireboats . Read Political Justice . Shelley reads the Ancient Mariner aloud . Letter from Harriet , very civil . ' In his prompt answer Shelley gladly responds to her altered tone ; but he has at length come to see ? what would have long been evident to any eye but his ? that the distance between their minds is unbridgeable . She whom he hailed in July as the sister of his soul is in October no more than a friend , and the mother of his dear child Ianthe . G. LETTER NUMBER 7 You had better continue to direct to Hookham 's . PANCRAS Oct ' 50 1814 Do not imagine that my feelings towards you are ever bitter or unfriendly : that it is necessary for me to wait until I am in a good-humour with you before I read your letters . The manner in which I addressed you of which you complain was produced by your own letters . No cold or distant feelings originated in me . I was desirous to be your friend in the most emphatic meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone of your letter gives me encouragement to hope that you at least desire my friendship . I think I am aware of the meaning of the word . To sympathise in our principles and views , to have common pursuits ' and habits of feeling is the origin of friendship and the attendant of every species of affection . I shall never cease to interest myself in your welfare . You were my wife , you are the mother of my child : you will bear another to me . But these are ties which only bind to worldly matters where sympathy in the great questions of human happiness is wanting . They produce mutual kindness , compassion and consideration . . . .2 but the sacrifice 2 and self devotion of an elevated friendship can not exist when the causes have ceased to act . Do not be dispirited by this consideration . There are probably many and very excellent persons in the world who are capable of being to you as the brother of your soul , who can participate your feelings , your tastes , and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person . I shall watch over your interests , mark the progress of your future life , be useful to you , be your protector , and consider myself as it were your parent ; but as friends , as equal ; , those who do not sympathise can never meet . Do not mistake me . I am and will be your friend in every sense of the word but that most delicate and exalted one . I solemnly protest to you that not the slightest unkindness or enmity towards you has ever entered my heart . If in reflecting on your conduct I seem to discover any traces 4 of generosity and virtue I am sensibly affected . Yes ! I am enough your friend to make the employment of a lawyer quite unnecessary . I do not seek an interview until I find that you entirely understand me : until I receive some additional pledge of the cor- respondence of our sentiments . I do not absent myself from unfriendliness or indifference , but from a consideration of the justice which is due to me and your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I committed an oversight in requesting them . I beg you to keep them . I can easily procure another copy . If you could copy for me and send one poem called an Indian Tale ? I wish to have it . Will you send also the Wandering Jew if it is with you ? How is my child ? One of the circumstances most painful to me in your estrangement from Mary and myself , is the separation from this infant . I know that by the law of nature she is yours , and not mine ? that your feelings towards her depend on physical sympathy , whilst mine are the result of habit and self-persuasion . I yield therefore to an hard , yet real duty . Allow me to hear from you again soon . Let me know the state of your health . And ever believe me , dear Harriet , Your affectionate friend P. B. S. When I can procure money , I shall make my arrangement with you . I shall not converse with any lawyer on the subject . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has called , but I have been so busily engaged with lawyers as not to see him . Have you a copy of the settlement ? Shelley 's requests for copies of poems are interesting , but I am unable to identify An Indian Tale , unless it be an early form of Fragments of an Unfinished Drama . The request for The Wandering Jew is important , as showing Shelley 's continued interest in this production of his of four years before . Medwin , his cousin , claimed a share in its composition . Shortly after writing this letter Shelley suffered an attack of lung trouble . Incessant worry over money and fear of arrest for debt had under- // mined his health . On Monday , October 10 , a gloomy letter from Harriet added to his distress . She is physically upset , and miserably lonely ; Eliza has taken Ianthe to Southampton , as London did not agree with the child . She will not allow Shelley to visit her , and the atmosphere of her father 's house breeds despair . But an answer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind off herself ; and her concern for him appears in a kind letter urging him to take measures to regain his health . While the attack of illness passed off , Shelley 's lack of funds now assumed an alarming aspect . He had mortgaged his income to Hookham the bookseller ; he had gone into debt for the ingrate Godwin ; the coach he had bought in 1813 for Harriet and himself remained unpaid for . The coachmaker Charters and other creditors had lost patience . On October 5 he had tried to arrange a negotiation to obtain ? 400 for ? 2400 of post-obit . On the eleventh the negotiation fell through and the money was refused . Without a friend who would help him , Shelley saw nothing ahead but the debtor 's prison for himself and starvation for those who de .. pended on him . In this harassed state of mind he writes to Harriet on October 12 , urging her to make her quarter 's allowance from him go as far as possible , for he has no assurance that he can pay the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humiliation of becoming entirely dependent on her father . H. LETTER NUMBER 8 5 CHURCH TERRACE , PANCRAS Oct ' le 1814 MY DEAR HARRIET , Altho ' I am entirely free from all apprehension as to your health , I am still very anxious to know the progress of your indisposition . Pray tell me exactly how you are . I do not know whether even now you may not have been confined . You have forbidden me to see you , or certainly my solicitude on your account would long before have led me to visit you . Your sister is absent from town ? On some accounts I regret to hear this . I wonder that her professed affection for you permitted her to leave you in the terrible state of dejection in which your letter of Sunday was written . Remember , dear Harriett , that such attachment as I profess for you is always to be counted upon : that if any exertions in my power , or my presence could amuse or benefit you , I am most anxious to perform these friendly offices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept them . Money affairs are in a desperate I state . If November arrives without further success I must go to prison . These matters require an attention on my part which I shall continue to extend to them , until they are settled . I have not any money to send you . I must attempt to procure a small sum at immense sacrifice 2 for present necessaries . If I can do this , and send you any , do not let your father be acquainted with it , as he will then entirely put the matter off to one who , however desirous , may not be able to procure the smallest sum . Pride is as efficacious as avarice . I do not doubt but that he would support you until I can procure money ; believe me , I am most anxious to spare you this degradation and wretchedness in depending on that selfish fellow . I may remark that an affair which I expected to complete has entirely failed , and that for the present I am without hope or resource . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make the advanced quarter last as long as you can . We find ourselves able to live at the rate of ? 4 a week much within our income . But I am not ignorant of the many additional expenses 3 required by your illness and expected confinement . I only remark my incapacity of assisting you at present . I thank you for your kind attentions in recommending me to abstain I from washing my head . I take your advice , but shall not wear flannel yet ? the complaint on my lungs which I mentioned is much better . I am in hopes of passing the winter without feeling another attack . Write to me very soon . Believe me , dear Harriet Most anxiously yours P. B. S. We come now to the darkest period of danger , privation , and suffering for Shelley and Mary . Professor Dowden says that the days of severest trial , including those of severance of Mary from Shelley , lay between October 23rd and November 9th. ' 2 A hunted man , with a mind so distressed that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his lodgings with Mary , unsafe even to remain at Peacock 's . Execution of the claim of the coachmaker Charters was expected on November 1 , and there was no possible means of staving it off except by an appeal to Harriet . The coach had been one of her pleasures in their days of comfort . It was now to be his ruin unless she could lend him temporary aid . In helping him she would be acting in her own interest , for she looked to him for income that would keep her partly independent of her father . On or about October 25 , Shelley writes to Mary : ' I have written an extremely urgent letter to Harriet to induce her to send money . , . . I have told Harriet that I shall be at Pancras when her answer arrives . ' Certainly the letter which follows is extremely urgent . ' I. LETTER NUMBER 9 ?

MS. obstrain Shelley , I , 488 MY DEAR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can effect something I must go to prison , and all our hopes of independence be finished . I see no resource . I must hide myself til the 60 and then if you can raise no money , go to prison to save my bail . Direct to me still at Pancras , , and tell use when I can hope to have a sum from you , and what that sum can be . I depend wholly on you . My own exertions have all failed . I tell you again and again that we must both be ruined if I can not quiet Chartres . And I know not whether , in the event of my going to prison , my estate might not be sold for a mere trifle to benefit my creditors . Write to me and send the money soon . Send what you can get , if in no other manner , by little and little . I should not have the conscience to press this matter so ungracefully if your danger was not almost equal to my own . Write quickly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , let it contain the ? 30 . I am certain to repay it in a fortnight . These vexations have induced my antient illness . I am perfectly free from danger but so exhausted as scarcely able to walk . This however does not matter . I have not a friend in the world who can assist me . My endeavors have been in vain . If once in prison , confined in a damp cell , without a sixpence , without a friend ( for I have mortgaged my income to Mr Hook-ham ) , I must inevitably be starved to death . We have even now sold all that we have to buy bread . I am with a friend who supplies me with food and lodging , but I think you will shudder to hear that before I could sell the last valuable Mary and her sister very near perished with hunger . My dear Harriet , send quick supplies . Very affectionately yours P. B. SHELLEY This appeal in extremity , which Harriet heard and answered , closes the list of the nine new letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interval of more than two years . It was addressed to Eliza , shortly after Harriet 's death . There is room only for the briefest summary of events in the interim , so far as they concern Harriet . The birth , toward the end of November , 1814 , of Harriet 's second child , Charles , was followed within a few weeks by the death of Shelley 's grandfather , Sir Bysshe ; and , after the winter of his misery , Shelley 's skies slowly grew brighter . In the summer of 1815 , as soon as he was able to do so , he gave Harriet g200 for her debts , and settled a further ? 200 a year on her , which , with her annual ? 200 from her father , was ample frir all her material needs . But Eliza and her father were determined not to let Shelley off so easily . Under their direction Harriet still refused to sign a deed of separation , and demanded additional allowance for the support of the children . On his side , Shelley felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the children , and accordingly asked for the care of lanthe . The Westbrooks refused , and riposted with a threat to take the matter into court , and to make a public scandal of his past behavior and his atheism . Shelley replied that in such case he would stop Harriet 's allowance . Checked by this , the Westbrooks then approached Shelley 's father , but Sir Timothy declined to be drawn into the contention . Another winter went by . In the summer of 1816 Shelley was absent with Mary on the Continent , but his friend Peacock , always a loyal supporter of Harriet , was doing what he could to straighten out her affairs . Harriet , whose childhood had been made unhappy by her father 's treatment of her , grew more and more miserable under his roof . As early as Jan uary 1815 , she had written to Catherine Nugent , I am still at my father 's , which is very wretched . When I shall quit this house I know not . Everything goes against me . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life is scarcely worth having . ' At some undetermined time between June and September , 1816 , Harriet left her children and her father 's house . The immediate cause of her departure remains unknown . Shelley afterward firmly believed that Eliza , to secure her father 's fortune to herself , managed Harriet so that she left home . It may be that at her first misstep her father banished her from the house . Possibly she was so wretched that any irregular connection , however foolishly entered into , which promised affection seemed preferable to life at home . The pathetic and sordid details of her misadventures are mercifully hidden . On November 9 , a few days before Shelley wrote anxiously to Hookham for news of her whereabouts , Harriet , overwhelmed with despair , had taken her long farewell of Eliza : ? Sat . eve . IlIY DEAREST AND MUCH BELOVED SISTER , ? When you read this let ! I shall be no more an inhabitant of this miserable world . Do not regret the loss of one who could never be anything but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . Too wretched to exert myself , lowered in the opinion of everyone , why should I drag on a miserable existence ? embittered by past recollections and not one ray of hope to rest on for the future . The remembrance of all your kindness which I have so unworthily repaid has often made my heart ache . I know that you will forgive me ? because it is not in your nature to be unkind or severe to any . Dear amiable woman that I had never left you , oh ! that I had always taken your advice . I might have lived long and happy , but weak and unsteady have rushed on to my destruction . I have not written to Bysshe . Oh , no , what would it avail , my wishes or my prayers would not be attended to by him , and yet should he rec. this , perhaps he might grant my request to let Ianthe remain with you always . Dear lovely child , with you she will enjoy much happiness , with him none . My dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our days of happiness to grant my last wish . Do not take your innocent child from Eliza who has been more than I have , who has watched over her with such unceasing care . Do not refuse my last request , I never could refuse you and if you had never left me I might have lived , but as it is I freely forgive you and may you enjoy that happiness which you have deprived me of . There is your beautiful boy , oh ! be careful of him , and his love may prove one day a rich reward . As you form his infant mind so will you reap the fruits hereafter . Now comes the sad task of saying farewell . Oh ! I must be quick . God bless and watch over you all . You dear Bysshe and you dear Eliza . May all happiness attend ye both is the last wish of her who loved ye more than all others . My children ? I dare not trust myself there , they are too young to regret me and ye will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine . My parents ? do not regret me , I was c nworthy of your love and care . Be happy all of ye , so shall my spirit find rest and forgiveness . God bless you is the last prayer of the unfortunate HARRIET S. To you my dear Sister I leave all my things ; as they more properly belong to you than anyone and you will preserve them for Ianthe . God bless you both . ' On the same day she disappeared from her lodgings . A month later the poor girl 's body was found in the Serpentine . The shock of this catastrophe was a terrible one to Shelley . Leigh Hunt says , ' He never forgot it . For a time it tore his being to pieces . ' It is clear that he had had no inkling from Eliza of the ominous tone of Harriet 's letter or of her sudden disappearance . Has/ tening at once to London , he sought the aid of Leigh Hunt . His two concerns were to find out what had led to ' this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children at the hands of the West-brooks . Inquiry soon satisfied him that Eliza was guilty of Harriet 's death . In an unpalatable and self-centred letter to Mary dated December 15 , Shelley eagerly disclaims all responsibility in the tragedy and accuses Eliza of virtual murder . It is proper to add , however , that the authenticity of this letter has been questioned . ' Not only is it misdated , but it turned up under suspicious circumstances years later , when its ' discoverer ' hoped to sell it for a substantial sum . Whether or not we are to believe that Shelley was unmanly enough to hasten to excuse himself of all blame . it is certain that he was convinced that most of it lay at the Westbrooks ' door ; and he wished all the more to get his children away from them as soon as he could . The two children , previous to the death of Harriet and without his knowledge , had been placed under the care of a clergyman at Warwick . Before resorting to compulsion , however , Shelley tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair speaking , to persuade the detested Eliza to relinquish little Ianthe and Charles . Letter Number 10 of the new correspondence is this politic communication . J. LETTER NUMBER 10 LoNDoN Dec. ' 18u ! 1816 DEAR ELIZA Before you receive this letter , Mr ' Boinville will probably have informed you of my resolution with respect to Ianthe . My feelings of duty as well as affection , as a father , incite me to consider every moment of absence and estrangement from these beloved and unfortunate children , as an evil , the sense of which has been increased to agony by the terrible catastrophe which is the occasion of this address . You will me and yourself useless struggles on this occasion , when you learn that there is no earthly consideration which would in : duce me to forego the exclusive and entire charge of my child . She has only one parent , - and that parent , if he could ever be sup-posed to have forgotten them , is awakened to a sense of his duties and his claims , which , at whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you twice yesterday . I wish I had found you at home . I designed to have communicated intelligence which I am aware is painful to you , in a manner the ' least painful . As it is , allow me to assure t you that I give no faith to any of the imputations generally cast on your conduct or that of W Westbrook towards the unhappy victim . I can not help thinking that you might have acted more judiciously , but I do not doubt that you intended well . My friend MI Leigh Hunt will take charge of my children and prepare them for their residence with me . I can not expect that your feelings towards the lady whose union with me you may excusably k regard as the cause of your sister 's ruin should permit you to mention her with the ' t honor with which Ianthe must be accustomed to regard the wife of her father 's heart . To deal frankly with you , I can not believe that you will refrain from inculrating prepossessions on her infant mind c the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worse of you for this ; perhaps you would have the generosity to curb the feelings that would lead to this effect , but I can not consent that days and weeks should pass , and that what I consider my duty and ? the happiness of my child should depend on ' your forbearance . I had the strongest wish to consult your feelings in this affair . And I can not but think that they would be best consulted by : immediate compliance . Nothing can shake my resolution . The lapse of a few weeks would only render the execution of it more distressing to you . As to Ianthe , a child 's sorrows are over in a few hours . MT Hunt will attend any appointment you may be pleased to make for deliveringthe children to his care in my behalf . I should feel most happy in complying with any request which you might make that is consistent with that agonizing and impatient sense of duty , which will not endure the absence of my child . I can most sincerely say , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bear no I purposely omit adverting to the event from which the occasion of this letter springs . All parties , I imagine , suffer too deeply to find any consolation in the unnecessary display of their sensations . I remain , dear Eliza , Yours very truly P. B. SHELLEY I may as well say ? tho ' I dare say APP B. has told you as much ? that my applying to my attorney on this occasion was founded entirely on error . If the ' December 15 ' letter be really Shelley 's , the disingenuousness of saying on December 18 that he gives ' no faith to the imputations generally cast on your conduct or that of Mr. Westbrook ' is certainly very unlike the frank and sincere Shelley . The rest of the letter is straightforward enough . He recognizes that Eliza hates Mary and that she is convinced that his union with her was the beginning of Harriet 's fall . Consequently , if Eliza kept the children , she would piously teach Ianthe to loathe Mary and abhor her father 's ideas about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be allowed . By this letter Shelley not only did his cause no good , but in the phrase the lady whose union with me you may excusably regard as the cause of your sister 's ruin ' he furnished Eliza with a weapon age nst himself which she was not slow to use in the subsequent Chancery dispute , Of course Shelley never regarded his union with Mary as the cause of Harriet 's ruin . He had admitted to Harriet what he considered his culpability , as we have seen , in Letter Number 3 : ' Perhaps I have done you injury , but surely most innocently and unintentionally , in having commenced any connexion with you . ' He was to blame for having foolishly fallen victim to Eliza 's matchmaking and Harriet 's appealing beauty when she threatened to kill herself for love of him . The misalliance of ideas and sympathies had made him despondent long before he fell in love with Mary . If Shelley had been forced to remain with Harriet , misery might well have overtaken them both . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deep , and irresistible that he could never be brought to believe that it might or should have been overcome . Though his conscience acquitted him , it was nevertheless bitterly plain that he had been used by fate as an instrument in Harriet 's tragedy . Peacock , who was Harriet 's friend no less than Shelley 's , tells us that ' Harriet 's untimely fate occasioned him deep agony of mind , which he felt the more because for a long time he kept the feeling to himself . ' Harriet has had her cold defamers and her impassioned champions . The apparently contradictory manifestations of her character have given each camp plenty of ammunition . Peacock says that she was always cheerful . Hogg observes that she was obsessed with the idea of suicide . She was fond of Shelley , yet proved cold to him , and voluntarily left him for several periods . She expressed warm affection for her children , but refused to nurse the infant Ianthe , and ultimately deserted them both . How can we understand her ? I am convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an independent , responsible adult character . From Hogg we have a vivid picture of Eliza 's control over Harriet 's every thought and act . He adds , Eliza had tended , guided , and ruled Harriet from her earliest infancy ; she doubtless had married her , had made the match , had put her up to everything that was to be said , or done , as Shelley 's letters plainly show . " Such complete mental and emotional servitude to Eliza must have retarded her growth . Hogg was puzzled by her suicidal obsession . Even in her happiest and most independent days with Shelley , she made self-murder a staple of conversation , calmly discussing in all companies her resolution of doing away with herself . But is it so puzzling ? It is common for the child who feels hopelessly inferior and dependent to make himself interesting and important by meditating suicide . Harriet 's mind never grew out of this childish state . Though she married and had children , she failed to develop into a wife and mother , and remained Eliza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure of her marriage , she reentered her father 's house ; and the unhappiness and restraints of the dependent child returned on her with added force . Even her children were more Eliza 's than her own . At the last , her one ineffectual effort to be an adult and live her own life led directly to her death . She was twenty-one when she died . Where is the blame in such a case as this ? Certainly Harriet was not responsible . Shelley , drawn unawares into a hopeless situation , struggled in vain to get rid of the sister and emancipate Harriet 's spirit ; but Eliza 's hold was stronger than Death . In utter ignorance of their crime , Harriet 's sister and father had made her unfit for the burden of life . There is no heart that will not pity her . Discovery of these letters has not only extended our knowledge of Shelley 's life during the obscure months of destitution and illness in the autumn of 1814 , but has also given us authentic evidence of the progress of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her immediately after revealing his desperate love for Mary : an amazing document , eloquent of self-delusion and of his fatuous hope that he could keep her as a best friend whom he had given up as a wife . We now know how persistent , in spite of his earlier disappointments in Harriet , this delusion proved to be . He cherished it through the summer ; and for weeks in the autumn he repeatedly exhorted poor Harriet to live up to the philosophy she once so docilely echoed from his lips . We now see Harriet in bitterness forgetting the fundamental generosity of his character ; losing all confidence inhim , and behaving as anyone but a Shelley might expect her to behave under the circumstances . She carries vulgar abuse , threat , and ignorant slander too far even for Shelley 's endurance , and his scarecrow hope of retaining her as a spiritual comrade falls to pieces before our eyes . Yet these new letters add nothing which changes our conception of the essential nature of Shelley as a man . It would be difficult to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and generous which had its best efforts more cruelly beaten by disappointment and disillusion . We feel for his sufferings , but we can not utterly deplore them . Suffering purged him of his early errors and folly , and helped him to become before his thirtieth year the wise and courageous leader who in his love of mankind hoped all things and endured all things .
