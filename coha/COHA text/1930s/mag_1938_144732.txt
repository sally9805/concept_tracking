Last winter it was discovered that Vincent Lopez , pudgy , decorous danceband leader , had been brooding long and heavily over the unsingableness of The Star-Spangled Banner . Suggested by Bandleader Lopez was a new version of his own , with its high notes pruned to fit the limitations of the average voice ( TIME , Feb. 7 ) . Bandleader Lopez ' version , duly performed in Baltimore 's Hippodrome Theatre , caused very mild applause . But last week , as Congress was hurrying toward adjournment , publicity-loving Congressman Emanuel Celler ( N. Y. ) urged official acceptance of Lopez ' " squeakless " anthem . Said Congressman Celler : " Why not enable everybody to sail into it ... with a more relaxed larynx ?

" Can you imagine the effect , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world would join together and sing Hallelujah ? " These words were practically a revelation to Lyricist Cook . He too , like Bandleader Lopez , had long brooded over the U. S. National Anthem 's imperfections , particularly deprecated such sworded sentiments as " the rockets ' red glare , the bombs bursting in air . " For several months he hammered away at a peaceful-plowshare version . Last fortnight he published it . The revised text : <P> Though long be the night , With the dawn comes the light <P> And the spirit of love soars upon wings like a dove . <P> While the song from our hearts Of our glorious flag <P> Tells the world of the Peace which is founded upon love . <P> While this spirit of Peace and of Good Will to men <P> Rings forth from our hearts On and on without end , <P> Oh long may our star studded symbol unfurled <P> Stand for light and love and Peace In its song to the world . <P> Impartial critics wondered what would happen if Lyricist Cook 's hallelujah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
