Most big corporations own &; operate the little switching locomotives that scuttle around within the boundaries of their plants . The railroads merely deliver and collect freight cars at the company gates . That practice eliminates the annoyance of having outside locomotives chugging about the works at odd hours , allows manufacturers to enforce their own rules against fire hazards , minimizes the opportunities for industrial espionage . <P> For a long time , however , a few big companies have bulldozed the carriers into paying them for operating their own equipment , arguing that freight rates were supposed to cover such switching and " spotting " service . And from 1927 to 1931 these few companies extracted from the railroads $9,000,000 in rebates for performing for themselves a job which they would not permit the railroads to do . Last week the Interstate Commerce Commission , ruling such payment illegal , ordered the carriers to cease &; desist . Wall Street chuckled at the list of manufacturers immediately affected by the I. C. C. order : almost all were plants or subsidiaries of three notoriously hard bargainers-U @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Ford .
