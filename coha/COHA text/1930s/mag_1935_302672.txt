Rich and rare is the religious fare served up each &; every Sunday in Detroit . From his suburban Charity Crucifixion Tower Father Coughlin broadcasts to the nation . In the Episcopal Cathedral Bishop Herman Page holds forth ably . Methodist residents of what they call the " Fourth City " know that Rev. Merton Stacher ( " Mert " ) Rice of mammoth Metropolitan Methodist Church has twice declined a bishopric . Likewise nationally known in their respective churches are Presbyterian Joseph Anderson Vance , Quaker Morton C. Pearson , Rabbi Leo M. Franklin . Congregationalists Charles Haven Myers and Warren Wheeler Pickett , Disciple of Christ Edgar De Witt Jones . <P> In any big city such a group of churchmen fraternize , lunch together , extend a friendly hand to a newcomer and , if he is a Protestant , welcome him into the local Federation of Churches . Lately a newcomer appeared in Detroit . But in all Christian charity many a Detroiter of the cloth found it hard to welcome him sincerely . He was Rev. John Franklyn Norris , loud Texas Baptist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tried and acquitted of murder . Last week it seemed likely that Baptist Norris would take a Detroit pulpit , settle there for good . <P> Born in Alabama 57 years ago , J. Frank Norris , like many another Southern divine , began preaching early , at 16 . In 1908 he went to Fort Worth 's First Baptist Church where he has remained ever since . Grimmest of grim Fundamentalists , he orates against Evolution , denounces the Roman Catholic Church , flays the " liquor crowd , " excoriates birth control and divorce , thunders against bridge , cigarets , the cinema . The fact that in 1926 he shot and killed one D. E. Chipps , friend of Fort Worth 's mayor whom Pastor Norris was then denouncing , did not bother the Baptists of First Church . Pastor Norris said he shot ( four times ) in self-defense because he thought Chipps was armed . A trial jury believed him . <P> Twice in a decade First Church burned down . Indicted for arson the first time , Fundamentalist Norris blamed the " liquor crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1929 , he raised money for a big new church in downtown Fort Worth .
