Premier Camille Chautemps , an experienced juggler of French political groups , could not manage last week to keep the Communist , Socialist and moderate Left supporters of his Cabinet from holding their noses . But while they were doing so . he got them to swallow the general principle of **29;1393;TOOLONG negotiation for a Four-Power Pact , envisioned by the British Prime Minister . The swallowing occurred at a session of the Chamber of Deputies which upheld Premier Chautemps and Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos 439-to-2 . <P> This did not mean that Chautemps can count on such overwhelming support in future , did not mean that the Chamber will finally ratify a Pact when negotiated . It did mean that France-feeling herself challenged by Hitler &; Mussolini-had reacted with a great surge of national unity to the idea that her diplomats ( " the cleverest in the world " ) should match their wits with Britain , Italy , Germany . <P> Paris often presents the weak aspect of a gang of disunited politicians tearing each other 's hair and kicking the slats out of the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Frenchmen do when they must . The might and unity of the Republic , not the prestige of Chautemps &; Delbos , both ephemeral Politicians , were behind their announcement to the Chamber last week that France will : <P> 1 ) Fight , if necessary , to preserve the " independence " of Austria ( which Delbos called " indispensable " ) . <P> 2 ) Fight , if necessary to give Czechoslovakia the support against an aggressor ( support pledged by her treaty of alliance with France ) but only if asked for such aid by Czechoslovakia. * <P> 3 ) Negotiate with a view to simultaneous settlement of the problems raised by Italy 's conquest of Ethiopia and the presence of foreigners fighting in Spain . <P> 4 ) Maintain close and cordial relations with Britain , the League of Nations and the Soviet Union . <P> There were elements of ambiguity in this forceful program , but it was the most clean-cut which France has achieved since the resurgence of German strength and weakening of Italian support of Austria . <P> " We all want a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' interjected leading Rightist Deputy Paul Reynaud . " Despite the deplorable exhibition of herself that she sometimes makes , France is still strong enough to ... help keep the balance of power in Europe !
