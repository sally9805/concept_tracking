Mr ancestors represented three nationalities . My father was of Puritan stock , from Yorkshire ; my mother was English , German , and French . Her paternal ancestor was a certain French baron and admiral who , being defeated by the British in a naval engagement off the New England coast , settled in the American wilderness , leading a life far from orthodox and leaving behind him a line of descendants whom the Anglo-Saxons had the habit of jailing for ' divers atheistic writings and beliefs . ' These men plunged deep into the forest , built log houses that would have done credit to a baronial estate , prospered as only Frenchmen can , and revised the Ten Commandments to their liking . I was born on a large farm in a beautiful valley . Across the road from the house was the remnant of a pine forest ? the ' Dark Forest ' the Indians had called it when it covered all the valley ? in which the wind crooned to me with my first breath . About me were miles on miles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played from the time of pink and scented bloom to that of scented and yellow fruit . Within view of my bedroom window was a great marsh , about which a river ran in a long crescent resembling a giant bowl broken in half . Here , in summer , thousands of bobolinks held high carnival until ruthless mowing machines cut down the rank grass from the tops of which these feathered revelers delivered their rollicking songs . Beyond the valley , like a huge drag on enveloped in its own breath , a low mountain slipped forever away over the western horizon . Over it ? or through it ? ? came at rare intervals the rhythmic beat of the ocean upon some vague shore after a heavy storm . Sometimes in the breathless silence of a winter 's night I would catch its mighty swing , and then my emotions would nearly smother me . Just behind our farm lay another mountain range , where , year after year , the panorama of the seasons passed in beautiful and sacred procession . In early spring the trailing arbutus ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough pasture land between receding snow banks soiled with the dust of burned-out shooting stars ; and no one , not even my mother , could gather such tempting nosegays of this queen of the northern wilderness as I could . Each returning April I filled the house with them , and stained all our hooks ? even the family Bible ? by placing between the leaves those showing the most delicate shades of pink . On April nights , with ' spring 's sweet trouble in the air , ' I would lie in bed beside my soundly sleeping brother and hear the frogs in antiphonal chorus in the pond beyond the east orchard . Since then I have heard the mocking bird , the skylark , the nightingale , but no bird 's song has ever kindled in me quite the ecstasy that those ' high flutes in silvery interchange ' awakened on those enchanted spring nights . My grandfather watched me through those childhood years with an ever-growing disapprobation that slowly kindled into something akin to hate ; and when , later in the summer , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my battered straw hat ) , he would protest to my father that I should be made to work , else I should come to some bad end . When the old fellow died he willed me a spavined horse out of his considerable property , presumably to emphasize his disapproval of me . Behind the pines that my father had saved , ostensibly as a windbreak for the buildings and orchards , but in reality because he loved them , was a no man 's land dotted with patches of second-growth pine and spruce , and the remains of logs decayed down to the level of the ground . In these brownish-gray remnants of ancient pines nighthawks laid their two creamy-white eggs , spotted with greenish brown and lilac . Between the old and the new growth of trees ran a swale , dense with alders , willows , elders , and , in season , cattails . Under the low spruce bushes along the edge of this depression nested the hermit thrush , to me the most exalted singer in all the feathered world . I would worm my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nest , and , when I had found one , lie with my head propped in my hands and look into the fearless dark eyes of the mother bird as she sat deep in a rather bulky structure sunk to the level of the ground . Never did I betray her by even so much as touching the clear bluish-green eggs when occasionally I found her away from the nest . In the . densest part of these second-growth spruces and pines I used tobury every fall a barrel of apples well below the frost line , and when all the apples were gone in our cellar I would dig clown to these . I always found them in perfect condition , except that the pulp had burst the skin around the stem and rolled out into a roselike excrescence . Lying on the pine needles under the low boughs , I would peel my apples and eat them . One day I saw a large buck rabbit looking intently at me through the branches , fitfully revolving his long ears and twitching his harelip as only a hungry rabbit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the motion of my arm sent him crashing through the brush . The story of how I tamed that rabbit to eat out of my hand , and eventually to sit on my chest , is a long one ; but I did it , although his better half ' usually sat a few yards away looking her pronounced disapproval . There was not a tree in that grove which at one time or another I did not climb . Many of them rose fifty feet without a branch , and in my numerous ascents to scrutinize the covered houses of squirrels and the nests of blue jays and crows I would frequently bark my shins . But the sight of blood did not disturb me . Indeed , it seems to me as I look back that I was always bleeding from some part of my scarred and lean body . As a little fellow I used to crouch at mouseholes and spring upon unwary mice with the deadly accuracy of a cat . Unlike the cat , though , I usually got bitten . Later , I used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , baiting the spindle with a sweet apple . To catch the squirrel was comparatively easy ; but to get him safely in my hand was a job that , in insurance parlance , might he classified as ' extra hazardous . ' The first squirrel I caught I let loose in the living room . I never did it again . The pretty little fellow developed into a red demon that worked such havoc with curtains , pictures , and dishes that I was in disgrace for a week . After many experiments , in which the squirrel often made his escape , I hit upon the device of raising the cover a little , thrusting in my hand , and seizing him by any part of his agile body that I could lay hold of . Often he would use his chisel-like teeth upon my fingers , sometimes cutting to the bone ; but I always held on to him until I had secured his tail . As a result , there were a goodly number of squirrels in that grove that suggested a certain rodent of Shakespearean literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devotees , not of the gas chariot , ' but of the broomstick . As I write this I am examining some of the scars on my hands left by the teeth of squirrels , muskrats , woodchucks , and a very deep one inflicted by the rapier-like bill of a wounded blue heron . Each is a reminder of my vividly real but utterly irreclaimable youth . These bloody encounters were , I take it , the savage side of me that was just boy . And the most savage rite I practised in that grove was robbing crows ' nests . The nest was always built hard up against the trunk of a tree on the opposite side from the prevailing wind . That , I suppose , sheltered it from both wind and rain . Also , the crows never built a nest where the foliage was dense . The somewhat bulky structure was always in a spot that commanded a fairly wide outlook of the surrounding grove . Further , it was seldom more than three fourths the distance up the tree . This , I presume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owls passing over the tree tops . Finally , it was in plain view of the ground , although the color of its coarse twigs and sticks blended so naturally with its grayish setting as to render it quite unnoticed by the untrained eye . Did the crow devise this last precaution before man with his upward-peering face appeared upon the scene ? The trunk of the tree selected for the nest was always difficult to climb , and by the time I was halfway up crows were darting at me from every side and fiercely snapping their bills within a few inches of my face . When at last I would reach the nest and look over the rim at the light-green eggs , spotted and blotched with blackish brown , the angry cawing , the swish of wings , and the snapping of bills became so alarming that it required real cool ness and courage to face the onslaught . One by one I would drop the eggs to the ground , and each motion would provoke a fresh attack . Only once did I toss a nestful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel yet the warmth of their ungainly little bodies in my hand , and the sense of guilt that went with the act of taking them from the nest . I never betrayed any other bird in that infamous way until I went on an ornithological expedition with an uncle , when in the cause of science we visited a group of lonely islands in the Atlantic and brought back the blown eggs and stuffed bodies of some rare sea birds . Once , as I shoved my way through the dense growth along the edge of the swamp , I came upon a cuckoo 's nest built about three feet from the ground in a spruce bush . I was right upon it before the mother bird , with a graceful flirt of her long slim tail , slipped noiselessly away and vanished in the thicket . There , under my very eyes , in the flimsiest of nests , were four cloudy light-green eggs ! I think that to my childish fancy this was the greatest discovery of my young life . As far back as I could remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until that unforgettable moment had never found either . Some years later , while passing through this part of the grove in a driving sleet storm , I noticed a large , inky-black bird clinging desperately to a writhing branch . Having my gun with me , I brought down what proved to be an unusually large raven . As I had only winged him , he made at me with a ferocity I had never credited his tribe with . I stopped him with the butt of the gun , into which he sank his talons as easily as if the wood had been putty . I dragged the old warrior home in triumph and tried to tame him ; but he was so filthy in his habits that one day when ; I was at school my mother set him free . My first intimate knowledge of death came to me when I was nine years old . It was early April , and I had gone trouting ' during the sunny part of the day in a small brook that wandered leisurely across our farm and joined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a log by a stone bridge , idly bobbing my line in the vortex of foam at the corner of the culvert : . Opposite me was a steep slope starred with the first dandelions , among which bumblebees droned as they hurried greedily from flower to flower . The bees and the dandelions were proving more fascinating than the wary old trout I knew to be hiding under the edge of the culvert , so I sat and watched them with that peace in my child 's heart which literally passeth understanding . A loud call from the direction of the river failed to rouse me . It was followed by another and another ; and then I heard a stentorian shout from a man who lived on the other side of theriver nearly a mile away . Looking up , I saw a woman running along the road toward the landing . Dropping my fishing pole , I ran after her , and , following a steep path down a wooded bluff , reached the bank of the river in time to see two men struggling with gray-haired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark , hurrying water . People kept pouring down the path and across the great marsh on the other side , until the babel of voices made it difficult for little me to find out what had happened . Then a hoop of an old woman whose chin always shook as though she were pronouncing a perpetual malediction told me that Ralph and Will were drowned ! The two boys had been collecting spruce gum all winter , and , wishing to go to town to sell it , had attempted to cross the river in a leaky skiff . The derelict had rapidly filled , and when in midstream they had lost their heads and leaped into the water , trying to swim to shore ; but the swift current had carried them over the rapids , and men working on a raft of logs at the landing had seen them both sink . How vivid still is the following night ! The lights from the many boats on the river where men were grappling for the bodies ; the old brass telescope through which they tried to scan the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poles ; the shouts ; the appalling silences . Then in the thick dawn a boat took shape out of the fog , and when it had been made fast to an old snag half buried in mud , two men lifted a dripping body from the bottom and started to carry it up the path . I slipped between grown-ups and looked at the face . It was Will 's ! I had been talking with him only the afternoon before , while he repaired some snake fence for my grandfather , for whom he worked . The appearance of that face with the freckles still showing on the wet checks is stamped deeper into the tablet of my memory than is any other thing . Later , from the same treacherous river , and up the same path , the body of my mother was carried . I followed close behind Will , and when they opened the door of my grandfather 's workshop and placed the corpse on a carpenter 's bench I watched with shivering disgust as one of the men who had helped to carry it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gum , selected a couple of amber-colored lumps and slipped them into his mouth . The summer tide raced up the river 's tortuous channel , meeting little resistance from the greatly shrunken stream of fresh water . As it boiled along it sucked up a fine sediment from the banks of the adjoining marshes , until the water became an opaque brown fluid resembling mineral paint . For a few minutes at the turn of the tide this devil 's broth ' became ominously quiet , then turned and hurried back toward the ocean , leaving behind it long , greasy , olive-brown mud banks . In this mud we boys wallowed , naked and unashamed , like creatures of the primeval slime . The spring tide in August , when the river had dwindled to a mere thread of water , would rush up the empty channel with a foaming brown crest upon its turbulent front . Into this we would plunge , and , with no further exertion than that of keeping afloat , be swept upstream for half a mile . But we often had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had to be made on foot , as we would not wait for the ebbing tide to carry us back . Usually there were folks , male and female , still making hay on the marshes , and to get past these unnoticed was a first-rate adventure . On one of these adventures , how- ever , I encountered a real difficulty . I had undressed in a clump of spruce trees , and as I neared it on my return I heard voices . Creeping up , I saw a young couple seated on a rug not ten feet from my clothes . The young lady was reading Longfellow 's Evangeline to the young man , who lay with upturned face at her feet , drinking in her every word . She not only read that poem to the bitter end , but they sat for a good half-hour afterward discussing its beauties . Later . I read Evangeline only under compulsion . When the nighthawks would gather by hundreds in the late afternoon over a certain field , keeping up a continuous roar as they swooped down about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They always congregated thus without warning , and in a few days the solemn hush which succeeds the departure of the song birds and the subsidence of insect life was upon us . Then the goldenrod , the aster , and the ' black dandelion ' came into their own , and the sunlight lay thick like yellow pollen upon the empty fields . From my bed at night I could hear the occasional muffled thud of an apple dropping to the ground in the dark and silent orchard , and the hesitant inquiry of an owl from the pines for the approaching frosty nights . On one of these evenings in early autumn the cows did not come home , and the next morning before daylight my brother and I were sent in search of them . As I stood with my bare feet . deep in the dewy grass , I chanced to look up at the stars . They had paused , and , leaning far down to me , were saying unutterable things that made me catch my breath in sudden rapture . Since then I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seven Seas , from the highlands of South Africa , from the top of one of the world 's loftiest mountains , from the stealthy tropic jungle , but they have never communed with me again . It was Stephen Phillips ? was it not ? ? who said : ' For the great stars consented , and withdrew . ' Once , during my college days , a professor of astronomy on a brilliant winter 's night took me to look through a telescope at a certain planet . When he had adjusted the instrument I took one look , then without a word of explanation turned and fled . In that moment of disillusionment I had seen through time and space ? even matter itself ? and out into the void . I did not recover from the shock for days . Indeed , I doubt if I have ever wholly recovered . For to me the stars are the most terrible things in the universe . IV Have you ever seen a mother skunk leading her young abroad of a summer 's evening ? If so , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinctured with caution , of maternal devotion without nonsense ! How plainly I can see one of these sturdy little creatures plodding along in the dusk , alert for any stray June bug , brush high over her back for the young ones to follow . Occasionally , on my way home from a late swim in the river , I would meet one of these worthy burgesses leading abroad her neat , well-kept family . The code of etiquette on such an occasion was quite elaborate . The mother would pause about three rods away , spread her uplifted tail to its utmost capacity , and then stamp firmly on the ground with a forefoot as a warning that I was to advance no farther . If I halted and played fair , she would slowly and in a most dignified manner back away and move off in another direction , the youngsters executing an orderly retreat behind her ; but if I stooped to pick up a stone , or continued to advance , I would certainly have a potent reminder of my rashness . Once , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusually large male . At sight of me he looked me squarely in the eyes , slowly raised his splendid brush ( I can see the long yellowish-white hairs cascading in the opposite direction as the tail reached an upright position ) , and then thumped vigorously several times with his left forefoot as a signal for me to retreat . But on that day my better judgment deserted me . I picked up a stone and threw it at him . The next moment I saw all the stars in the firmament as a stream of yellowish oil hit me squarely in the eyes . In an agony as great as any I have ever suffered , I tore blindly through the bushes , across a marsh , and , plunging into the river , thrashed about until I had washed away enough of the deadly stuff to enable me dimly to discern objects . It was weeks before I wholly recovered my sight . The supreme event of each autumn was a visit to a certain poplar grove on the side of the ' Hog 's Back ' ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth of a mountain gorge . From childhood I have loved yellow above every other color . The dandelion , the buttercup , the goldenrod , kindle in me an emotion such as Wordsworth must have experienced when he first saw his host of golden daffodils . I understand that a love of yellow is an attribute of childhood ? something elemental , primitive . So be it ! The first sharp frost would reveal to my searching eyes the poplar grove in its setting of sombre spruce and fir . Day after day the yellow would grow more pronounced , until early October found it a great cloth of purest gold . I would watch it until I deemed the coloring ripe , perfect , then slip quietly away some smouldering afternoon and visit my holy of holies . By that time the leaves were beginning to fall , and the ground was a great yellow carpet into which my feet sank luxuriously . I would sit there in the solemn hush that had come over the forest , broken now and then by the late drumming of a grouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of evening struck through my cotton shirt and forced me to be going . In a battered volume of The Story of an African Farm that has thrice encircled the globe with me I found the other day some of those poplar leaves . A few thrills of my childhood days are still vivid in my memory . On one occasion a half dozen of us little boys were splashing along stark-naked through the tall bulrushes that fringed the river , heading toward a certain quiet eddy for a swim , when my foot encountered something more substantial than the greasy mud left by the tide . Glancing down , I looked into the wide , sightless eyes of a bearded and bloated face half buried in the slime . A cry from me brought the other boys to my side . For a long moment we stared in horrid fascination , then broke and ran . I did not stop until , breathless and naked , I burst into our kitchen . It proved to be the body of a drowned sailor carried upstream by the tide . Although later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to life again , the nearest I ever came to death in my childhood was on a pleasant May morning in a quiet pasture . My grandfather had bought a big black stallion whose coat shone like a crow 's wing . Even my five-year-old intelligence divined that there was something bad connected with that splendid creature . Whenever he was led to the watering trough from the barn I always took refuge behind a high board fence , and through a crack watched him curve his haughty neck , plunge his muzzle into the trough in a way that threw out half the water , and then greedily drink . On this day I had slipped between the rails of a snake fence into the horse pasture , looking for dandelion blossoms . I was on my knees rounding out a handful of the yellow beauties when I heard heavy footsteps behind me . Glancing round , I saw the most terrifying sight ever a child beheld . Standing high over me on his hind legs was the black stallion ! His eyes were blazing , his red nostrils widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just above my head . A horrible snort galvanized me into action , and I darted for the fence on all fours ( lucky that I did n't have time to rise ! ) , the towering monster walking on his hind legs just behind me . I can still see ? and hear ? the long yellow-white teeth with which he snapped at me as he reached his head far over the top rail . As many another can testify , the ear is a far more potent vehicle of fear than the eye . One short December day I had hurried home from school , slipped over my cowhide boots a pair or long woolen stockings , and started oil through the fluffy snow for the daily round of my rabbit snares . When I reached the first snare that afternoon the sun was on the horizon and dusk was already gathering under the low thick boughs . This snare held a gray bunny , frozen stiff , its head twisted far back over its left shoulder , and its popping eyes glazed with frost . By the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the open places under a brilliant winter moon . In front of me , stark against the moon 's face , was a large buck rabbit dangling from a spring pole . I was bending down the gray birch , slipping my hand along toward the snare , when a piercing cry came from a clump of bushes not three rods behind me . Dropping my rabbits , I stood rigid with fear . In a few moments the cry was repeated . It was that of a child being murdered ! Surely sandals of lightning were on my feet , and I slackened my pace out in the open pasture only when my pounding heart and burning throat compelled me to . My father , beautiful character that he was , did not laugh at me , but explained that the cries were from a rabbit caught in one of my own snares . V As soon as hard weather ' set in , my father would yoke ' Star ' and Lion ' in the ' Dutch yoke ' and drive them to the nearest blacksmith shop to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mind a truly fearsome undertaking . The patient brute was coaxed or bullied into a boxlike place between heavy uprights , a great apron of the stoutest leather attached to rollers was passed under his body , and then these rollers were turned , lifting the fear-stricken beast clear of the floor . Then the burly smith would seize a leg , ? sometimes only to be hurled across the shop , ? drag it out to one of the beams that ran on either side of the frame , and , after securely lashing down each foot , bottom up , begin the work of shoeing . How I used to hold my breath in fear as the half-moon of iron , a sharp calk on either end , was taken red-hot from the forge and placed gingerly on the hoof . As it touched , a cloud of pungent smoke arose , and I would wince in imagined pain ; but when the great brute gave no signs of discomfort I breathed freely again until the process of nailing on the shoe began . As each nail was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it were entering my own flesh . Seldom , however , did the thick-chested German shoer prick an animal ; but whenhe did the bulky captive would give no uncertain notice of the mishap . On the way home , Star , the nigh ox , would at first avoid all ice ; and the puzzled look in his big smoky eyes as he gradually discovered that he would not slip on it made the old fellow seem very near to me . Star was long , small of barrel , and striped like a tiger , with a pair of slim , sharp horns whose glossy black tips pointed straight forward . All the other oxen in the neighborhood had brass knobs on their horns ; but my father , for reasons known only to himself , never would use them . Star was conceded to be the champion fighter of the neighborhood . With head low and tail high , he would give swift battle to anything that opposed him . The dull thud of the meeting frontal bones , the quick digging in of toes , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settling back of the vanquished , the spring sideways , and the lightning-like thrust of Star 's deadly horns into the exposed flank ? of a truth , man Snatches the glory of life only from love and from war . The anguish in my boy 's heart when Star at last went down to defeat is still vividly real . Ike Durland was a cattle buyer who scoured the country to the west of us for beef on the hoof . Twice a year he would drive a large herd of sleek oxen and fat cows along the road past our farm toward the nearest city . The dark red , lowing , trampling mass was advancing late one afternoon when I chanced to be driving Lion and Star across the road to the pasture . At sight of Star , a huge red-and-white ox in the van of the bovine army lowered his head , snorted , and began to paw at the road in long slow sweeps that sent a cloud of dust high over his back . Star promptly accepted the challenge , and my heart thrilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The shock of the meeting shook the solid earth . Each animal humped his back , stiffened his neck , and then ? oh , the shame and anguish of it ! ? Star crumpled up like paper , springing away just in time to escape the great curved horns that , backed by a good ton of beef , were directed at his exposed flank . Hannibal , Napoleon , Charles XII ? no , the anguish of any one of these in his dark hour could not possibly have been greater than mine . Later , horses replaced oxen on the farm ; but they never displaced my love for Lion and Star . A sweating horse , like a sweating man , is an ill-smelling thing ; but the breath of kine has inspired poets . Running through this pagan joy of my childhood , this dear delight of living in a world in which even snakes were my playfellows ( I see yard-long Old Nick ' as he used to lie in the dust , darting out his red forked tongue in sheer delight as I gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dark thread through a cloth of bright gold . It is the Puritan conscience . To my child 's mind anything was right if it gave pleasure to any of God 's creatures and wrong if it brought them pain . To me , God , as the people of the community thought of Him , was simply nonexistent . Even when I was a small boy my remarks to the different clergymen who took tea at our house were pronounced highly dangerous by those dignitaries . VI It was about this time that there occurred the most momentous happening of my young life . The schoolhouse , which also served for hall and meetinghouse , stood at the edge of our pine grove , and there I attended school until I reached my teens . In that schoolhouse there was only one room , and one teacher for all the pupils ? some five years old , sonic twenty . I passed a good deal of my school time playing ' soldier . ' The game was simple and harmless enough . In the grove we would gather a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached needles , and , pressing a cluster together , draw a knife across the tip , leaving the end square . Stood on end , the slightest breath would start these soldiers marching across the desk , now slow , now fast , to right , to left , or in a close formation that was calculated literally to overthrow the enemy . Usually these mock battles escaped the notice of the harassed teacher ; but occasionally we would come to blows over the outcome of some disputed engagement , when we would be punished and our soldiers thrown into the stove . I was eleven years old when the thing happened that was to mould all the remainder of my life . I was sitting in the back seat on the boys ' side of the room , my bare feet dangling a good six inches above the floor , my breath skillfully directing an army against Abner 's embattled hosts . The teacher was frail , flat-chested , with a sparse brown beard , chalk-white forehead , and pale blue eyes in whose puzzled depths lurked the vague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when gradually I was aware of his voice reading to a class of young people . ' Roll on , thou deep and dark blue ocean , roll ! Ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain . . Although it was June , warm and lovely , I felt the gooseflesh coming out all over me , and chills running up and down my spine . By the time he had finished I seemed to be freezing to death . I never finished the battle with my pine soldiers , and through the magic door which that voice opened for me I entered into the rich heritage of English poetry . The architects of that schoolhouse ( in imagination I see them coming together some evening after milking ) were confronted with the difficulty of building a structure that from the outside would resemble a church , but in reality would be a schoolhouse . When the wind blew , the gable end behind the teacher 's desk would sway in and out a good six inches , and as time passed the plaster on it showed signs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crabbed old fellow who went on crutches . He would sit behind his high desk with his hat on ( his head was bald and the cavernlike place drafty ) , and occasionally summon some larger boy up to his detestable presence for an application of a strap that he had borrowed from my father 's harness . Abner was the first boy to discover the widening crack in the plaster , some thirty feet above our tormentor 's head . Day after day we watched that crack with a fascination bordering on the hypnotic , and whenever the gable swayed in and out we were so well behaved that an occasional glint of suspicion narrowed the old tyrant 's fishy eyes . That morning a stiff wind was blowing , sifting the newly fallen snow over the shiny crust with a hissing sound . Toward noon the wind increased to a gale that swooped fitfully round the pine grove from the northeast and landed upon the gable with a force that made it sway in and out like the flank of some heavily breathing beast . ' Old Fish-Eye ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcoat , quite unconscious of his impending doom . With bated breath we watched a great slab of plaster tip out a few inches from the wall , and then return to its place as the gable buckled back . We waited with savage expectancy for the next onslaught of the wind . Then the totally unexpected happened . The old tyrant got up from hischair , and , taking his crutches , hobbled down to the stove , already red-hot , to see for himself if any more wood could be poked into its cavernous maw . He was noisily replacing the cover when the crash came . A half ton of plaster swooped clown from the gable , smashing the pedagogic chair and desk and a small globe that had taken me on many thrilling adventures through steaming tropical Africa and frigid Siberia . ' And he had n't been near the stove for a month ! ' growled Abner . My first fistic encounter was also my last , and its effect upon my entire subsequent life has been , I suspect , profound . Since then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person striking another in the face has always filled me with horror . I have seen men mutilated in accidents , shot to pieces in action , without being greatly disturbed ; but at the sight of one man pommeling another 's face I am quite unnerved . I have never attended a prize fight . Among the long list of games which we played at that school was one which I suspect was unique . Along the edge of the swamp where the hermit thrushes nested grew withe-woods ( botanical name quite unknown to me ) , long , slim , pea-green , and in the hands of an expert an instrument of exquisite torture . If two boys had a difference ' not of sufficient gravity to be settled with the fists , they would proceed to the swamp , arm themselves each with the supplest and longest withe-wood that could be found , and then return to the green plot behind the schoolhouse , upon which no spying windows peered . The tournament at Ashby was never looked forward to more enthusiastically than was one of those gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The opponents would advance into the open spot , about which were ringed the boys of the school ; each would remove his coat and waistcoat , often leaving only a thin cotton shirt over the body ; one would raise his arms high over his head , and the other , after measuring the distance between them with a practised eye , would coil his withe-wood about the body of his adversary with all the skill and power behind his lithe young arm . If the withe-wood was a long one , it would encircle the body twice , the tip often slashing viciously through the shirt , and drawing blood . Six strokes was the limit , when the other fellow would take his turn , the two alternating until one lowered his arms and declined to endure further punishment . The sharp intake of breath among the spectators , the look of utter savagery upon the encircling faces , strongly suggest a certain dance I once saw among Malay headhunters . After one of those scourgings I would be blue-black for days from armpits to hips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On either side of the schoolhouse yard was a high fence constructed of boards placed upright one against the other . Not quite solid , either ; for a West Indian Negro who had strayed north among us occasionally gave an exhibition of prowess by rushing at the fence , leaping clear of the ground en route , and smashing a board with his head as he descended . For some reason he had spared the fence on the west side of the yard , and against this , on a good snowballing day , we would stand a certain beanstalk of a boy over six feet tall and weighing less than ninety pounds . Then the mob would arm itself with snowballs and proceed to outline the victim 's body against the dark gray background of the fence . For a few moments the air was blurred with flying missiles , above the whiz of which came an occasional howl of pain from the unlucky wight who stood figuratively and literally with his back to the wall . Even on a cold winter 's day I have seen him wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . My grandfather kept sheep , and in the flock one winter was an exceptionally large ram with great corrugated horns that in their backward sweep touched his massive shoulders . The sheep pen adjoined the barn floor , which ran corridor-like through the two-hundred-foot structure . By reach . ing over into the pen with a long stick , from the end of which dangled a tin pan , I discovered that ' Billy ' could be provoked to a spirited charge . Then I had a bright idea . I tied a rope to a pan , climbed up on the end mow , and my brother let the bellicose Billy in upon the unobstructed and spacious floor . With a look in his eye that clearly signified a burning wish for more worlds to conquer , he quickly discovered the dangling pan , and charged it with a zeal worthy of a Don Quixote . The pan rang under the impact of the blow , and the sport was on . That any living thing could be as persistent and enduring as that ram passes belief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , desisting only when we heard my grandfather 's heavy tread approaching through the creaking snow . By February we had Billy in the pink of condition . We made several attempts to induce him to exhibit his prowess upon grandfather ; but , for some reason known only to sheep , he declined . Then came the golden opportunity . A fat little Irish butcher with a delightful brogue came one day to buy a pair of beef steers . His rosy face carried the proverbial wreath of smiles , and as he walked he pushed each short fat leg past his protruding ' bay window ' as if making a determined effort to get ahead of it . Three good feet of the fluffiest of snow had recently fallen upon a crust stiff enough to carry a person 's weight , and the jolly little man was proceeding from the barn to the house along the narrow path worn deep by grandfather 's substantial feet . With my brother just behind me on the lookout , I stood by the sheep-pen door , measuring with my eye the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before connecting with the butcher , then opened the door and stood quickly aside . Billy , already scenting battle , stuck out his battering-ram of a head , blinked in the sudden sunshine , and then discovered the roly-poly Irishman as he waddled along the slippery path . With an air of spurning the vulgar earth beneath him , Billy touched that path only four times before he gained his objective . The butcher , as if in defiance of the law of gravity , suddenly rose , and , performing a curve like an exaggerated football shot from the toe of an expert punter , landed face downward in the snow and ploughed along under its disturbed surface for a couple of rods upon the glassy crust beneath . The appearance of that Irishman when at last he emerged and gained his feet was fascinating . He so closely resembled some rotund and harmless snow man , such as we always made in the front yard out of the first snowfall , that the roar which at length issued from him came as a complete and shocking surprise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder is he held together . Grandfather , who stood on the steps of his back porch watching the latter part of the untoward performance , was so outraged by this outburst of unseemly language that he refused to let the offender have the steers . Our nearest neighbor was a sardonic old fellow with a face like Voltaire 's ? as that gallant old Frenchman 's Christian opponents conceived it to be . We children stood in deep fear of him , knowing the dreadful things he did . For had he not beaten a sow to death in her pen , stabbed to death with a pitchfork a heifer that kicked when he tried to milk her , and ? most shocking of all ? set a fox trap under a sweet-bough tree and caught Ann Poole in it when she ventured into his orchard after apples ? One afternoon my brother and I found a hen 's nest in a clump of hard-hack near the back of his barn . The eggs were deeply stained , and sloshed when we shook them . Why not plaster the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him right ! In high glee we gathered those eggs , three dozen strong , into our straw hats , and , slipping up to the woodshed , peppered the door until it looked plague-infested from top to bottom . Suddenly the door opened , and we fled . That night is ' one of the most memorable in history , ' so far as I am concerned . My mother led the two of us supperless to bed , spanked us with a large and astonishingly capable hand , and then requested us to kneel and say our prayers . My tow-headed brother prayed as best he could between gulps , and climbed sobbing into bed ; but I flatly declined either to pray or to cry ; declared , in short , that ' it served the old devil right , ' for which gem of truth I received another spanking more vigorous than the first . Only on one other occasion during my childhood did that dangerous spirit take possession of me . It was on a Sunday morning , and my mother had told me for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back stairs , I made some defiant remark , when my father , livid with sudden rage , sprang after me , and , dragging me out into the back kitchen , flogged me until I could n't stand . A few weeks before I had bought an old gun ( paid for with muskrat pelts and cider apples gleaned from under the sodden leaves in the fence corners ) , and this I loaded , firmly resolved to shoot my father before the day was done ; but as the flame of my anger died down , I wept bitterly , unburdening my outraged soul to my dog . My mother , before her marriage , was called the most beautiful woman in the county from which she came . Tall , straight , with coal-black hair , white skin , and frank French eyes that measured one at a glance , she was by nature a joyous pagan with a passion for the out-of-doors and a divine instinct for making any plant grow that she entrusted to mother earth . Born into the Catholic faith , she was caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaped . I can see her yet sitting by the window searching the Bible for the sin against the Holy Ghost , which she feared she had committed . In the dead of night she would rise , get the great family tome , and continue the search , and , when she had fastened upon some verse which she regarded as proof of her eternal damnation , summon my father to corroborate her decision . How well I remember his patient , harassed face as he strove to persuade her to return to bed . From her bedroom window my mother could see the graveyard . In the farthest corner was a long row of tall white tombstones , marking the graves of several generations of B ? s , whose house was a half mile up the road . One night she woke my father and pointed to a light moving across the fields from the B ? house toward the graveyard . It entered , and , proceeding to the corner in which the B ? s were buried , vanished . In a few days , quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside his kinsfolk . Finally my mother came to watch for those lights with a fearful fascination , always rousing my father to bear witness to the incredible thing . The light would appear shortly after midnight , and was always followed by another death in the ill-fated B ? family . If my very sane father had only smiled at my mother 's hallucination the story would not have impressed me so deeply ; but to his death he declared that he also saw the lights . I should like to see the alleged facts placed before the Society for Psychical Research and hear its ' hard-boiled ' explanation . VIII Occasionally an evangelist would come down from Boston during the winter months and hold revival meetings in the schoolhouse . On one of these occasions my father , who years before had backslid , returned to the fold , and the next morning astonished us children by bowing his head ? I can see the part in my mother 's raven-black hair as she bowed hers also ? and saying grace . After that , grace was said before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indifference silenced what is to me now the only really sacred religious rite connected with my childhood . The next winter a velvet-tongued evangelist appeared who was truly a high-grade artist . He did not rant and roar ; he had a much more effective method of bringing sinners to repentance . He simply played the melodeon and sang over and over in his sugary voice emotional hymns that have mesmerized countless thousands of guileless folk . I was entering upon adolescence , and the emotional appeal of this smooth gentleman found me fertile soil . The meetings had been in full swing for a couple of weeks , and I was growing vaguely afraid of that sugary voice ; but I entered the schoolhouse that evening as usual and sat in the back seats with the gang . ' As the music went on and on I felt something tugging at me , drawing me forward ; but I gripped the desk and resisted , until I saw a hard-drinking old horse trader in front of me begin to weep , and , swept forward on vocal billows of rejoicing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had happened , I found myself beside him , and the next moment a soft , seductive hand was on my shoulder and the sugary voice was in my ear . I went home with my head as high in the clouds as if I had been smoking opium , and all night , until the break of a cold January dawn , I said over and over , over and over : ' I 'm saved , I 'm saved , I 'm saved ! ' When I awoke later in the morning and looked out into the pitiless winter sunshine , I half expected that the bitter weather would have no further power over me ; but when I came to dress , my toes and fingers stung as usual , and when I arrived downstairs the wood box had to be filled . In a few days I had recovered from my emotional spree , and I never indulged in another . My baptism ended my formal religious experience until I stood at the grave of my mother , when my convulsive weeping was mistaken by the officiating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul ! Only in some old European cathedral , and that rarely , has the spirit of formal Christianity returned to me . Once , years later , on my return to my native land , I attended a Wednesday night prayer meeting as in my boyhood days . As the fathers , markedly aged during the years of my wanderings , knelt one by one and asked fervently for the same old impossible things they had asked for in my childhood , my eyes in roaming about the familiar place rested upon a print of the crucified Christ hanging upon the wall . The gaunt body was raised against an utterly barren background , and as I looked at it the futility of altruistic goodness swept over me . Then , as if by a magician 's wand , I saw poor humanity through His eyes , and suddenly loved Him . Quietly I got up and slipped out into the night . The sky was clear , and the stars in their fathomless black gulfs were sweeping on , just as they swept on when the first glimmer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweep on when the last baffled interrogator turns his face helplessly up to them . What was I ? the man on the cross ? all life ? in the face of that cold and heartless immensity ? As the unthinkable aeons wore on , even those stars would be utterly annihilated and return into the void , only to reappear in new worlds ? over and over and over . Against such a spectacle those old men praying to their own collective shadow seemed less than nothing . But what about that morning in my childhood when those same stars leaned down , and , communing with me , filled my soul with unutterable joy ? What about the ageless chorus of the frogs beyond the orchard , and the prayer of the hermit thrush ? Is science leading man into a deadly morass from which there is no escape so long as he worships at her shrine , and will he continue to dwindle until all his glorious spiritual heritage is lost , leaving only a highly intellectualized animal , well ordered , passionless , with no further capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man eventually rise triumphant above a depersonalized universe , and reconstruct another spiritual kingdom nobler and more spacious than that which science has destroyed ?
