txt Henry Ford , at a single stroke , has cut the Gordian knot of Detroit 's confused and paralyzed banking situation by virtually taking over the two great groups of national banks here . After a week , during which officers of the First National Bank and the Guardian Detroit Union Group vainly besought him to join the group of large depositors in putting up capital to permit a reorganization , Mr. Ford and his son . Edsel Ford , made a counter proposal to puf up the entire capital themselves and assume complete charge of the two new banks which are to replace the old ones . The Ford proposal finally was accepted tonight . The incorporations will be effect24:1 tomorrow , and on Wednesday the banks will open and pay at the rate of 30 cents on the dollar to the depositors in the two old banks . frhe slow assets of the two old banks - will remain in those institutions , and as fast as they are liquidated the funds so obtained will be paid to depositors . How great a Percentage of deposits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Critic Becomes a Banker . Thus Henry Ford , a critic of bankers , becomes the dominant banking figure of Michigan , and by the same move one of the big bankers of the United States . And thus he abandons a distinction of which he has been proud  --  that he did not own a share of bank stock and was , - ot on the directorate of any bank ; notwithstanding that he has cash and entirely liquid assets estimated by bankers here at $500,000,000 . In thus becoming a banker himself , Mr. Ford is having another ' fling at Wall Street . He has never forgotten his battle with the bankers thirteen years ago when , as a condition of lending him $85,000,000 , they insisted in having a voice in his business . His answer to that was to raise the money from his dealers . In taking over the banks tonight , Mr. Ford is keeping Wall Street out of them . Part of the set-up which the Detroit bankers laid before him , in seeking his subscription of stock i was an offer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not put a nickel if they 're in  - -  not a nickel , " Mr. Ford told them , according to the bankers themselves . But in entering the banking world tonight , Henry Ford is doing so on his own terms and with the undoubted intention to run the banks with the same originality that he has used in his manufacturing . A statement given out tonight at Mr. Ford 's offices at Dearborn indicates this clearly . " He Mr. Ford has very definite 5deas concerning the functions and management of banks , " said one paragraph . " He believes that the bank 's first function is to provide a place of safe deposit . He believes that bank loans should be made for productive and not speculative purposes . So revolutionary are some of his ideas along this line that he saw little hope of having them adopted by a bank board of which he would be but one member . And he would not own stock in any bank that continued to operate along the old lines . " Outlined Some Views on Banking . Mr. Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculation , and in an interview with THE NEW YORK TIMES last week , just after he had rejected the appeals of the bankers here to join other depositors in subscribing capital for the reorganization , he expressed his , ideas of how a bank should be conducted . He said then that banks should charge a small fee , jut as garages charge a fee , to depositors who put their money in a bank just for safe keeping , and that the bank should Mot risk that money . Money used for the purpose of Making money , he - said , should be used on a profit-sharing basis , the depositor sharing in the earnings as well as in any possible losses . He expressed the belief also that many bankers were too young , and that the mature , seasoned professional type of bankers should be employed . It is understood that Mr. Ford intends to have not more than five directors on his bank boards , and they are to be real executives . In making his agreement to take over the banks , Mr. Ford has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new institution , and it is freely predicted here that he intends to do this . Mr. Ford and Edsel Ford issued the following statement tonight to the national banks : Detroit , Mich. , Feb. 26 , 1933 . To the depositors and directors of each banking group : We are ready to join you in the creation of two new banks and will match the total necessary capital which we understand is eight million two hundred fifty thousand ( $8,250,000.00 ) dollars with the good brains of those who are willing later to unite these banks into one institution founded on what we think sound banking should be , provided you have confidence in our ability to select the men whom we all believe will merit future public confidence . The institutions so established will be the type of financial structure that will merit public faith in the ability of industrial Detroit to rehabilitate itself . HENRY FORD . EDSEL B. FORD . New Executive Staffs Likely . The action of the Fords also indicates that most of the executives of the First National and Guardian Detroit Union groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this evening , when word circulated that an agreement with Mr. Ford was probable , there was an air of relief that at last a solution had been reached , and an air of deject.ion among those who felt that they were to be dropped . Henry Ford , Edsel Ford and the Ford Motor Company are the biggest bank depositors in this city and State and have about $60,000 , - 000 tied up in the banks which were closed on Feb. 14 under the holiday proclaimed by Governor Comstock. because of the emergency in the banking situation . Henry Ford has $7,500,000 on deposit in the Union Guardian Trust Company of the Guardian group , $22,000,000 on deposit with the First National , and $31,000,000 on deposit with the Guardian Detroit Bank . In addition the Fords have contributed about $20,000,000 of financial aid to banks here in recent emergencies . Edsel Ford is a director in the Guardian group . When the emergency in the Detroit banking situation arose , early this month , first the bankers and then President Hoover by telephone , attempted to induce Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Union Guardian Trust Company , subordinated to other deposits , but Mr. Ford refused thus to underwrite the bank , believing that that was a function of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and not of a private individual . The efforts of the banks to obtain large loans from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation were blocked , largely through the objections of Senator Couzens of Michigan , and the bank holiday was dedared to avert disastrous runs . Michigan has been virtually without banking facilities ever since . Dramatic Entry on the Scene . Mr. Ford 's dramatic entry on the banking scene tonight came when the national banks had exhausted every recourse . The banks had to accomplish two feats if they were to resume . One was to raise new capital and the other I was to obtain large loans from the Reconstruction Finance Corpora1 tion . Late last week it became evident that their hope of raising sufficient capital from large depositors , many 1 of whom are embarrassed , was waning and that Mr. Ford was their only hope . Then the Reconstruction Finance 1Corporation informed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but could advance only $54,000,000 for the First National and $24,000,000 for the Guardian group . The reconstruction corporation delivered an ultimatum to the bankers to give their answer to this ? which meant having the required amount of capital pledged  --  by 6 o'clock tonight . And so , in a final conference at the Ford offices at Dearborn this afternoon and tonight the Ford offer was approved . Statement Details the Events . A detailed account of the events leading up to the assumption of the banking leadership of the Fords was issued tonight at the Ford offices . It was as follows : Efforts of the officers of the First National Bank and the Guardian National Bank of Commerce to meet conditions laid down by the Controller of the Currency and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation before government aid would be extended to Michigan resulted Friday in an offer from Henry and Edsel Ford to provide all the necessary capital for two new banks . The offer has now been accepted by directors and depositors of both the old banks . This will immediately provide Detroit with ba.nking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an immediate initial payment of about 30 per cent . The Ford offer came upon the heels of Henry Ford 's refusal to become a stockholder in any bank plan thus far proposed . He had been appealed to on Thursday for permission to " freeze " part of his deposits in both old banks and have these amounts credited to him as bank stock in the proposed new institutions . His reply was a definite refusal . The Ford refusal of Thursday was based upon two distinct grounds : First , that it would complicate the Ford relation to the general banking situation in Detroit . Henry Ford himself held no stock in any bank and was not on any bank board , he was only a depositor ; but Edsel Ford was a stockholder and director of the Guardian group , which he had personally assisted on three occasions in the past to prevent banking difficulty . On Side of Depositors . Henry Ford felt that for him to become a stockholder in the same banks in which he had been only a depositor would be to desert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the banks involved there were 450,000 depositors whose accounts amounted to less than $500 each , and that their small amounts were just as important to them as his larger amounts were to him , So he elected to retain his - place with the depositors . The second ground of refusal was his belief that , as one stockholder among . many , he would n have little or no influence over the type of banking practiced by the new institutions . He has very definite ideas concerning the functions and management of banks . He believes that the bank 's first function is to provide a place of safe deposit . He believes that bank loans should be made for productive and not speculative purposes . So revolutionary are some of his ideas along this line that he saw little hope of having them adopted by a bank board of which he would be but one member , and he would not own stock in any bank that continued to operate along the old lines . That was the situation Thursday . Conference Held With Fords . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obtain sufficient subscripitions of stock in other quarters , until on Friday they were readyto admit that , without assistance from Mr. Ford or some association of him with the new banks , their task was hopeless . Again they sought a conference with Henry Ford at Dearborn , at which were present Henry Ford , Edsel Ford , E. G. Liebold , Clifford B. Longley , Wilson W. Mills , Dr. Fred T. Murphy and J. Thayer . All phases of the matter were thoroughly canvassed . Wires were opened between Dearborn and Washington for conversations with the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and Controller of the Currency during the afternoon . At that time the Controller of the Currency stated his minimum requirement as to the capital structure of the two new banks , setting $7,500,000 for the First National and $3,500,000 for the New Guardian institution . With this in view the Reconstruction Finance Corporation had previously expressed its probable willingness to furnish $100,000,000 for the liquidation of the First National and $35,000,000 for the liquidation of the Guardian , on the express stipulation that payments to depositors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims . Problem of Raising Capital . There still remained the problem of raising the $11,000,000 with which to establish the two new banks . Without two new banks it was not possible to meet the conditions made by Washington . The utmost efforts of the officers of the two old banks had failed to provide the required capital structure of the new institutions . Explaining the failure to find capital , in addition to the absence of Henry Ford from the set-up , it should be said that many of the largest deposits , especially in the First National , were those of railways , fraternal societies and other trust funds , which could not legally be applied to the purpose of taking stock . At this juncture Henry and Edsel Ford made their offer . Upon half a sheet of paper they offered , in substance , to join in the creation of two new banks , matching their $11,000,000 with that part of the banking experience and conscience of Detroit which should declare itself in harmony with Ford ideas of how banks should be managed . The offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fords ' ability to select the Detroiters suitable to direct the new enterprises . Repurchase Clause Suggested . All present at the conference expressed themselves relieved and satisfied with the offer . It was suggested by one of the directors of one of the old banks that there be inserted an agreement that if within six months the stockholders of the old banks should be able to buy control of the new banks , they should have the privilege of doing so . The proposer said that it was unthinkable that the old stockholders would become able to exercise the option , but he thought it might prevent uninformed criticism of Henry Ford and forestall charges that he had " gobbled up two banks . " Mr. Ford replied that he would not be a party to any subterfuge , that he would rely on his acts to answer any criticism and that he would not pretend to be offering an option which the proposer admitted could never be exercised . The matter ended there . In the meantime , A. P. Leyburn , national bank examiner of the Seventh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the State moratorium was proclaimed , was in receipt of a telegram from the Controller of the Currency instructing him to hasten completion of the agreement on the basis of $11 , - 000,000 capitalization for both banks . The representatives of the banks then left Dearborn to consult with their boards . There the matter stood through Friday night . All that remained to complete the arrangements was the final word of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation that the $135,000,000 of bank relief had been allotted to Detroit , and the issue of charters for the two new national banks , the total capital of which had been offered by the Fords . R. F. C. Aid Is Reduced . Early Saturday morning the conferences were renewed . The picture was changing . During the day the Reconstruction Finance Corporation suggested the advisability of reducing the amount of aid offered to Detroit . Finally , at 10:30 Saturday night , the Reconstruction Finance Corporation reduced its offer of $135 , - 000,000 assistance to the figure of $78,000,000 , reducing the $100 , - 000,000 expected for First National assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group to $24,000,000 . This reduced to 30 per cent the hoped-for 50 per cent first payment to depositors . It also reduced the amount of capital required for the two new banks from $11,000,000 to $8,250,000 , distributed as follows ? $5,625,000 for the successor of the First National and $2,625,000 for the successor of the Guardian bank . Detroit bank managers labored with the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to restore the old figures , but Washington was firm . A definite answer from Detroit was required by 6 o'clock Sunday evening . The Federal authorities desired the nation to be met Monday morning by the good news that the Michigan situation had been definitely assured of settlement . Meetings of directors of both old banks were held during Sunday afternoon and stockholders ' meetings were held in the evening , at which the Ford offer to supply the bank capital was approved . The Ford action , with its assurance that money will flow once more in the channels of Detroit commerce and industry , waa the brightest spot on the horizon after two gloomy weeks . The Detroit Savings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State , announced today that it would open its commercial banking department tomorrow without regard to the 5 per cent withdrawal restriction imposed by the Detroit Clearing House Asgbciation . The only restriction on withdrawals from the commercial department is that money withdrawn must not be hoarded or deposited in any other Detroit bank . Withdrawals for necessities will be permitted from savings accounts . ?
