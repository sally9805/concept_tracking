Jean de Botton is the only French painter accredited by the British Government to paint the Coronation ceremony inside Westminster Abbey ( by request of the Duke of Gloucester ) . Yet when a friend took twelve of his bright canvases around to Manhattan 's Harriman Gallery , the dealers knew next to nothing about him . After looking at the pictures , however , they decided promptly to hang them , did so this week . <P> Jean de Botton is the bellwether of a small group of French painters who confess that the chief aim of their art is to give pleasure .

Dream of a Child is a Santa Claus and horses vaguely limned in pink highlights . In Three-Masted Schooner , green and bronze hues on the sails seem to reflect light from both shore and sea . Most striking of the nudes depicts an olive-skinned brunette and a rosy blonde reclining in affectionate languor on a couch , the pink sands of the Mediterranean gleaming through a window , a pink curtain blowing across a table , a statuet of a man on a pedestal in the background . <P> Jean de Botton was born in Royan 37 years ago , of a French father , an English mother . His parents tried to make him a diplomat but Jean , already a worshiper of Tintoretto , Mantegna and El Greco , stood them off , earned a living doing posters and sketches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nu an trois-mts ( nude and three-masted ship ) . Of another picture , Lda , a critic said that it delivered the kick in the stomach characteristic of genius . De Botton 's portrait of Author Jules Remains ( Men of Good Will ) , his onetime philosophy teacher , was bought by the French Government .
