txt Favoring Trolley Cars . Why does every one take it for granted that buses should take the place of trolley cars ? I consider the latter far pleasanter , although I grant that there is no pleasant mode of transportation in this city  --  all are bad . Trolley cars are high-roofed , have big windows and more air and the seats are roomy . They have no nasty fumes or gases . They are much easier to get in and out of and one can stand up in them without stooping . They only need to be repaired and put in smooth running order , with conductor at one end and motorman at the other , and have one every two blocks to be a quite decent and comfortable method of transportation . Buses are horrid , uncomfortable things ; no room to sit ; no air to breathe ; no space to stand up in , and squinchy little windows . ELIZABETH S. ROGERS Sr. New York , Feb. 28 , 1934.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
