" We need to define what an aggressor nation is . We need to have a tribunal where the facts in any case may be discussed and the decision made before the world , as to whether a nation is an aggressor or not . Then the steps decided on could be taken in conjunction with other nations . . . . Our real ultimate objective must be a change in human nature . . . . " <P> Had this ambitious program been launched last week by Franklin Delano Roosevelt , it might well have caused an international sensation . It was , however , merely another evidence of the social-mindedness of his articulate wife whose latest book was published to coincide with the New Year . <P> Concerned with smaller subjects in this troubled world , Franklin Delano Roosevelt last week had nothing on his mind except preparing 1 ) a message to Congress on the State of the Union , 2 ) another on the Budget and 3 ) a speech for his Party 's Jackson Day dinner this week . While his children and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas and New Year 's , the President put in a busy week in his study . When Congress convened this week he drove to the Capitol . There , to a packed chamber of Senators and Representatives , he an- nounced that he had finally given up hope of balancing the budget in 1939 , that in attacking monopoly his Administration had no intention of attacking business as a whole , and that the current Recession was the cause of more perplexity than fear ( see col. 3 ) . <P> Because the bombing of the gunboat Panay has made the U. S. more receptive to the idea of a bigger Navy and because a Naval building program would help depressed business , Washington was not surprised when Franklin Roosevelt wrote to Chairman Edward Taylor of the House Appropriations Committee : <P> " The preliminary estimates . . . called for appropriations to commence during the fiscal year 1939 two battleships , two light cruisers , eight destroyers and six submarines . Since that time world events have caused me growing concern . . . . The fact is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only continuing but are enlarging their armament programs . I have used every conceivable effort to stop this trend and to work toward a decrease of armaments . Facts , nevertheless , are facts . and the United States must recognize them . Will you , therefore , be good enough to inform the subcommittee on Naval Appropriations that after the next session of Congress has met , it is possible that I may send supplementary estimates for commencing construction on a number of ships additional to the above program ? " In a proclamation carefully guarded until markets closed on New Year 's Eve , the President set the U. S. Treasury 's price for newly mined domestic silver down from 77 an ounce , where it had been since 1935 , to 64 an ounce , where it was first pegged when the New Deal started juggling with the price in December 1933 . Net result was to reduce the difference between U. S. Government and world market silver prices by about 40%.                 @ @ @ @
