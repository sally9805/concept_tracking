The Great Powers represented at the Brussels Conference , while waiting last week for the Japanese Government to reply to the second invitation to join them in discussing the war in China ( TIME , Nov. 15 ) , were treated in the Belgian press to gratuitous coaching in Oriental psychology by the Japanese Ambassador to Belgium , Mr. Saburo Kurusu . <P> According to Ambassador Kurusu , even a second rebuff should not discourage the Conference from inviting Japan a third time . " When first the warning cry ' Tiger ! Tiger ! ' is heard in an Indian village nobody pays any attention , " explained the Ambassador . " The second time perhaps a few natives reach for their swords . But it is the third cry of ' Tiger ! Tiger ! ' which arouses the village .

" Now that the door to conciliation and mediation has been slammed in your face by the latest reply from the Japanese Government , " Koo told the Conference , " will you not decide to withhold supplies of war materials and credits to Japan and extend aid to China ? It is , in our opinion , the most modest way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check Japanese aggression and uphold treaties . "
