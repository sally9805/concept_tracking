txt With Treasury Department experts working on plans for refinancing maturities of about $727,000,000 falling due on Dec. 15 , in such a manner as to avoid any step that would represent outright inflation , interest here in the monetary situation tonight was focused on what the RFC would offer tomorrow for gold . For five days the administration has kept the price at which the RFC will buy newly mined domestic gold at the same figure , $33.76 an ounce , and this evidence of moderation has been accompanied by a stiffening of the market for government securities and a strengthening of the dollar on foreign exchanges . Thus there was much speculation as to whether steps to cheapen the dollar would be renewed tomorrow by another increase in the RFC gold bid . The opinion heard generally was that if any increase were made it would be small , as recent developments have indicated that the Treasury is anxious to avoid further instability in the bond market at this time . All this , however , was a matter of conjecture , as officials in high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheered . The knowledge that the Treasury was going ahead with its refinancing plans , without thought of issuing greenbacks or seeking to have the Federal Reserve Banks buy government securities direct from the Treasury , was received by groups who are fighting outright currency inflation , as a hopeful indication . This was evidence , it was argued , that the effort to stimulate commodity prices by forcing up the value of gold would not be pressed rigorously in the face of contentions that it was slowing up activities of the NRA and other government recovery agencies . There was a relative degree of calm in the controversy which has raged here during the last week , but it was apparent that more oratorical and written outbursts were imminent if the gold - purchase drive is again set in motion on a large scale . Representative B. H. Snell , of New York , minority leader of the House , arrived here today to remain until Congress assembles in January , and will compare notes with other Republicans . Mr. Snell is a " sound-money " man and strenuously opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have more carefully studied the situation and can learn just where the administration is planning to take us , " Mr. Snell said , " I may have a formal statement . I am hoping to see the President carry out his inauguration promise of ' sound money ' and abandon what now looks like a program for currency inflation . " The Republicans , he remarked , would strongly oppose any increase in taxes , and would insist that the administration adhere to its economy program in the next fiscal year . Hope for More Caution Voiced . Reports from Warm Springs indicate that the President has no intention of abandoning his goldpurchase program , but some opponents hope that further steps will be taken with extreme caution , 3eading possibly to a form of currency stabilization or control within certain limits within the next month or two . Henry Morgenthau Jr. , Acting Secretary of the Treasury , and Genpral Hugh Johnspn , administrator ' of the NRA , will return from Warm Springs tomorrow . It is believed that these officials have carefully canvassed the whole situation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the President and that developments after their arrival may give an inkling of developments in administration policies . So far as increases in the price at which the RFC will buy newly mined gold are concerned , this phase of the administration 's activities has been slowed up radically in the last twelve days , when it was found that sharp advances in the gold price were accompanied by wild gyrations of the dollar , and were threatening to cause a heavy flight of capital . The gold program was started Oct. 25 and between that time and Nov. 14 the RFC price for gold was raised by $2.20 an ounce , or from $31.36 to $33.56 . From Nov. 14 to Saturday , the last day on which a quotation was announced , the increase was only 20 cents , and for five successive days last week the same price , $33.76 , was fixed . Treasury Officials Confident . Meanwhile , Treasury officials have expressed confidence in the soundness of the market for government securities , and have intimated that no alarm was felt over the necessity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on high authority that even the milder inflationary step of direct purchase of government securities by the Federal Reserve Banks has not been considered . The attention of observers , therefore , has turned to the type of securities which will be issued to meet the maturities of $727,000,000 on Dec. 15 , and the size of the issue and interest rates which the government will pay . While decisions are based on market conditions and are not made until the last moment , the belief here at present is that short term , issues will be employed , along with ' such money as is available from income tax payments of about $150 , - 000,000 due on Dec. 15 , and , possibly , the employment of part of the large sum now in the general fund . The balance in the general fund on Nov. 23 amounted to $1,187,000 , - 000 . It is kept at a high level because of the demands of the recovery program . While the government , probably , would have to pay higher interest rates than those paid on recent issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient to handle the immediate refinancing operation could be marketed without great difficulty , particularly if the market is not unduly disturbed by vigorous prosecution of the gold purchase program .
