At pretty little Santa Rosa , Calif , last week , 8,000 fun-loving rustics sat in the grandstand of the Sonoma County Fairgrounds , watched 46 local jalopies rattling round &; round the trotting track in a 100-mile " Tin Lizzie Derby . " <P> On the 80th lap , in front of the grandstand , two cars traveling at 50 m.p.h. locked wheels . A third car , trying to avoid them , caromed into a fourth . Before the crowd could let out a collective scream , 19 cars had piled up ( see cut ) . Eight of the drivers were rushed to a hospital . None died .
