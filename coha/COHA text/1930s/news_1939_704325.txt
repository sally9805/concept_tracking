txt Central purchasing of supplies for municipal departments has been overwhelmingly approved " in principle " by voters of Springfield , and a committee of City Council members and citizens has been authorized to submit a specific plan for the new department .

Approval in theory of this modern practice has been followed at once by the practical questions whether the purchasing agent shall be a resident of Springfield at the time of appointment , and if the job shall have the protection of civil service or be subject to appointment by the Mayor . These questions are to be answered in a report of a committee which includes three purchasing agents for large industrial organizations .

Criticism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a campaign promise two years ago not to Morrow for current expenses ; a practice to which lie resorted both years to avoid marked increases in the tax rate . Mr. Putnam also put through the City Council two large PWA projects , a $3,000,000 flood control and sewage disposal program , and a $1.500,000 Trade School project . His appeal for the traditional second term of a Mayor in Springfield won out , but his majority of 6,000 in 1937 was reduced to less than 1,000 votes this year .
