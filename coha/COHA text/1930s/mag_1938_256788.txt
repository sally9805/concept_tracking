At the modernist Fhrerhaus ( " Leader 's House " ) in which the Munich Conference was held ( TIME , Oct. 10 ) , Adolf Hitler last week received the new Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Dr. Frantisek Chvalkovsky , who officially assured the Fhrer that " Czechoslovakia will assume a loyal attitude toward Germany . " * <P> Dr. Chvalkovsky knew that in a nearby Munich hotel was waiting former Hungarian Premier Dr. Koloman Daranyi on a mission from Budapest to ask the Chancellor to " advise " Czechoslovakia to yield 8,000 square miles to Hungary-enough territory to pinch off the eastern end of Czechoslovakia and give Hungary &; Poland a common frontier . The Hungarians had been offered 2,000 square miles which they indignantly rejected last week and Hungarian Regent Horthy promptly mobilized approximately 500,000 troops with the slogan " for Peace , not for War . " <P> The German Dictator , after talking with Dr. Chvalkovsky and later with Dr. Daranyi , said to them privately that Hungary can get only the same sort of thing as Germany got in the Sudetenland and no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not give Hungary and Poland a common frontier . <P> The Hitler " can " was completely unofficial . Officially the Fhrer sent Dr. Chvalkovsky and Dr. Daranyi back by air to Prague and Budapest with the advice that their Governments must settle the matter by negotiation . Meanwhile , 500,000 Czechoslovak soldiers faced 500,000 Hungarians , and in one potato field the trenches were less than 85 yards apart . <P> <P> * Eduard Benes accepted an invitation to lecture on Democracy at the University of Chicago .
