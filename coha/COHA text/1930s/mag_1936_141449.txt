When Alf M. Landon stopped talking generalities and got down to cases at Buffalo fortnight ago , one of his lustiest blows was aimed at New Deal taxation . " If the major portion of the Government 's income , " he orated , " is obtained from indirect and hidden taxes-taxes upon such things as food , clothing , gasoline and cigarets-then the main burden falls upon those of small income . . . . <P> " The share of the cost of Government falling mainly on those with incomes of $25 a week or less has increased 25% during the three years of the present Administration . " <P> Following up Nominee Landon 's lead , the Republican National Committee last week scattered over the U. S. a sheaf of Press releases on taxation , a brochure entitled Soak the Rich Taxes Really Soak the Poor . Purpose of both was to depict the tax load supposedly borne by the Little Man . <P> " I paid $1.50 for this shirt , " reflects the GOP 's Average Taxpayer . " Sixty-two taxes took 29 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this $18 suit . Fifty-three tax collectors took 59 of the $3 I paid for this hat . . . . " <P> At the breakfast table his average wife joins him , points out that " more than 50 tax collectors take 2 of the dime they paid for the loaf of bread . " In the course of the day the Taxpayer counts 1,200 taxes , his wife 1,500 . <P> This time the Republicans obligingly documented their case with a list of 58 taxes which , they claimed , added 2 to the price of bread . An amazing political document , the list contained not 58 different kinds of taxes , but only 16 types , which the Republicans had multiplied by applying them individually at each step in the process of making and selling a loaf of bread . Thus a Federal income tax paid by farmer , grain elevator , flour mill , railroad , flour trucker , baking company and retail distributor counted as seven taxes . Even after multiplication , it was shown that only 13 of the 58 taxes were Federal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Of the 16 kinds of taxes , only three were Federal : On income , on capital stock and on excess profits . These three , the only ones which Alf Landon could possibly reduce if he went to the White House , were not hidden but direct taxes , which he favors . <P> *Samples : Local real-estate tax , county real-estate tax , municipal real-estate tax , school district real-estate tax , local personal property tax , county personal property tax , municipal personal property tax , state income tax , motor license tax , auto truck state license tax , occupation tax , tax on grain storage , electricity tax .
