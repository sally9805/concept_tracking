txt From the Institute of Law of the Johns Hopkins University comes another fruitful study of justice as it is administered in one of those minor courts I which are most immediate to " the average citizen . " " The " Justice of the Peace Courts of " Hamilton County , Ohio , " is a collection of first-class information . The " squire " is the first stage in the administration of law . In petty civil cases ? in Hamilton County the J. P. 's jurisdiction is confined to cases involving less than $100 ? his ylecision is usually final . It is also swift and expensive . But it is swift and inexpensive in a great number of cases in which the magistrate induces the parties to settle out of court . In collection o ( debts the plaintiff seems to win in more than 70 per cent of the cases . Perhaps we may assume that the money is honestly owed . The J. P. also hears petty " crim1 inal " cases , but 99 per cent of these never get into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constable and let off with payment of 1 costs , thereby avoiding the publicity of a trial . But in these times the sociologist looks for something cheerful and may even venture to neglect the conclusions of these learned inquirers , which are no meat for the layman . Let us look at original , strong and traditional specimens . Here in a note is this opinion or dictum of a Georgia judge : A justice of the peace is generally a man of consequence in his neighborhood ; he writes the wills , draws the deeds and pulls the teeth of the people ; also he performs divers surgical operations on the animals of his neighbors . Cincinnati lawyers still speak fondly of " Squire SEDAM of the old " Storrs Township , who ' banished ' " a chicken thief to Kentucky and " had the constable row the expa " tria.te across the Ohio River in " a skiff . " They still cherish the memory of Squire WICK ROW . Acknowledging a deed , he always signed his name " to the body of " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " knowledgment . " Nor are the moderns bereft of genius . A lay justice just elected said to a veteran in office , " Of course , I do n't need any " advice on the law . I merely want " ed to ask you what kind of en " velopes you buy to file the papers in . " Legal training could only have injured that magistrate of saving common sense who told two families of foreigners quarreling about a barking dog : The law in America will not tolerate such petty bickering as you all have been found guilty of . You must promise to be friends . Go home . Have a home-brew party . It is good to know that " both families now are fond friends . " In a case of breach of the public peace the entry on a docket reads : After hearing the testimony of the plaintiff , the defendant and the witnesses , I found that all were equally guilty , and the defendant I and plaintiff were both placed under a $100 peace bond and fined half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this decision , which would have given so much happiness to Judge EBENEZER RoCxwOOD HOAR . And SOLOMON in all his wisdom was an unseasoned lad compared with the J. P. who sat in a case where the defendant was charged with receiving stolen chickens . The court impounded fifteen Plymouth Rock and two White Rock hens , and proposed to turn the flock loose at twilight . If the chickens found their way into the chicken house of the defendant and went " on the roost in a natural way , " they were to be the property of the defendant . If they acted " strangely and failed " to find the coop , they were to be " returned " to the complainant . At dusk the constable , " assisted by a deputy sheriff , " released the birds . Seventeen found their way to the defendant 's roost " in a natural way . " Thus the case was decided . Will it be believed that the Court of Common Pleas reversed ... decision so clairvoyant , whose natural justice was demonstrated by that unanimous flock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
