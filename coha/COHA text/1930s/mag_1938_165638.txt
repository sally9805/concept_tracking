Superstitious , nervous spinsters bank on the old adage that lightning never strikes twice in the same place . Superstitious , nervy gamblers bank on the chance that bad luck will also scatter its bolts . Last week both lightning and luck struck with tragic redundance : <P> Back in 1913 , a young undertaker named John A. Maxwell played golf with two companions on the Raritan Valley Country Club course , Somerville , N. J. As they approached the tenth green , a thunderstorm broke . A forked tongue of lightning licked the fairway , kicked all three players on to their backs , ripped one golf bag down the middle . None of the players was injured . Last week , on the same fairway of the same golf course , in the corresponding week of the corresponding month , at the same time of day ( about 3:15 p.m . ) Golfer Maxwell was struck down and killed by lightning . <P> Back in 1919 , a young racehorse who was destined to be great , Man o ' War , was led to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , N. Y. When the starting signal was given , Man o ' War was facing in the opposite direction from his rivals . That was the only race Man o ' War ever lost . The horse which beat him was named Upset . Since that day race fans have thought of the Sanford Memorial as the race in which Man o ' War was licked by bad luck . <P> Last week another young racehorse which racegoers thought destined to be great was led to the Saratoga barrier for another Sanford Memorial . This comer was Mrs. Charles Shipman Payson 's Thingumabob , a two-year-old . He had run away with his two previous starts this season , had become the highest juvenile money-earner of the year ( $31,810 ) by winning the rich Arlington Futurity . For the Sanford he was such a favorite that his odds , 1-to-4 , were the shortest quoted all season at Saratoga . <P> At the start Thingumabob bobbled . He was way back in seventh place at the end of the first sixteenth . Then he began to move up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second place , coming up in an open switch on the inside of Ariel Toy , the pacemaker . Suddenly Ariel Toy closed the switch by cutting towards the rail . Thingumabob reared , then crumpled . His right front ankle had snapped above the fetlock . He limped to the outside fence , fell to his knees , gallantly lifted himself to his feet again as the track veterinarian shot him dead .
