For Brutus is an honorable man , So are they all , all honorable men ! <P> The six Japanese Bruti who slew Premier Ki Inukai for his " excessive pacifism " ( TIME , May 23 , 1932 ) stood in the dock before the Naval Court Martial at Yokosuka naval base last week while their Japanese attorney , in his final defense plea , quoted adroitly from Shakespeare 's Julius Caesar . <P> The irony of Mark Antony 's reference to Caesar 's assassins as " honorable men " was lost-as the defense attorney hoped and expected it would be-on a bench full of Japanese naval judges weak in English classics . They assumed that when Shakespeare wrote " honorable men " he meant honorable men . The case before the court last week turned on the pivots of honor , patriotism and Japanese devotion to the Divine Emperor . One by one the six assassins had testified that in slaying Premier Ki Inukai , a clever politician known throughout Japan as " The Old Fox , " they acted " to bring the Emperor into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed that the assassination was a protest against the " shameful naval ratio " of 5-5-3 provided in existing treaties for the U. S. , Britain and Japan-the assassins contending that it ought to be 5-5-5 . Surely such an assassination was the act of " honorable men . " <P> So it was , the Naval Court Martial decided . Instead of death the six Japanese Bruti received prison sentences of from 10 to 15 years . <P> Among politicians throughout Japan extreme indignation seethed at this decision by the Navy . Only a few days prior the Japanese Supreme Court had sustained the death sentence of the civilian Tomekichi Sagoya who also alleged patriotic motives for his shooting of Premier Yuko ( " The Lion " ) Hamaguchi ( TIME , Nov. 24 , 1930 ) . Unlike " The Old Fox " who died instanter at the hands of his Naval petty officer assassins , " The Lion " recovered partially from his wounds , lingered through a winter , spring and summer before dying . Why death for Civilian Tomekichi Sagoya , who almost failed to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who did foul , instantaneous murder ? <P> No prominent Japanese dared be quoted on the issue last week , but the Japanese news agency Rengo reported that a highly placed civilian statesman said : <P> " We are struck dumb on hearing the sentence in the naval case . . . . You know the sentence imposed on Sagoya for shooting Hamaguchi . " <P> From a high naval personage Rengo obtained this : " It was indeed a pity that Sagoya was condemned to death , contrasting with the just sentence of the Naval men . . . . Had even a single naval defendant been sentenced to death , unrest would have developed among the officers of the Imperial Navy . " <P> Ridden roughshod by Army and Navy leaders since the occupation of Manchukuo , Japan 's political leaders have been casting desperately about for some means of regaining their lost power . Recently the two great political parties Seiyukai and Minseito-normally as friendly as cats and dogs-made overtures to each other and were working feverishly last week to achieve union and strength against the men of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
