When the late Dr. Samuel Smith Drury was Rector of St. Paul 's School ( Concord , N. H. ) , he was offered two other jobs : the Episcopal coadjutor-bishopric of Pennsylvania , the rectorship of Manhattan 's Trinity Church ( " one of the most enviable jobs in or beyond the Episcopal Church " which has often proved a stepping-stone to the top-ranking bishopric of New York ) . St. Paul 's is the oldest and biggest of the haughty Episcopal preparatory schools , and its headmastership always ranked high , but Dr. Drury 's nolo episcopari enormously increased the prestige of the job . When stern , sonorous Dr. Drury died last February , S. P. S. trustees searched the Church for a man capable of filling Dr. Drury 's shoes . Meanwhile , quiet Vice-Rector Crocker Kittredge , son of Harvard 's famed Professor George Lyman ( " Kitty " ' ) Kittredge , ran the school . <P> Last month the trustees thought they had found their man : Rev. John Crocker , 38 , studious , absentminded , enthusiastic high Churchman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Harvard ( where he played end on the football team ) , Oxford . Grotties speak of " Jack " Crocker as logical successor to Groton 's 80-year-old Headmaster Endicott Peabody ; and he himself has declined nomination for the bishoprics of New Jersey and Vermont . Last week , after long pondering St. Paul 's School 's offer , he returned a nolo docere , turned down the job .
