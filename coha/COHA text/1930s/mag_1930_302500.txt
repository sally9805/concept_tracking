With great grumpings and whirrings , 156 sugar mills in Cuba last week commenced to grind the 1930 cane crop . Set in motion by a presidential decree , they will work night and day for four months manufacturing some 4,500,000 tons of raw sugar . About the centrals was a new and unexpected enthusiasm . Officers and workers smiled and laughed for they had something to make them happy : the Senate of the U. S. had refused to increase the U. S. customs duty on raw sugar . <P> In the Battle of Schedule Five of the Senate 's tariff war , Old Guardsmen , led by Generalissimo Reed Smoot , chairman of the Finance Committee , had stormed the redoubt of the Democratic-Progressive Republican coalition with a demand for a higher sugar rate . The fighting was fierce and confused , with troopers switching from side to side like the tail of a fly-bitten horse . When the lines were reformed and counted , it was found that the Old Guard had been repulsed . <P> Rates . What happened , legislatively speaking , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U. S. is 2.20 per lb . Cuba , enjoying a 20% differential below the world rate , pays 1.76 per lb . At the demand of cane growers in Louisiana , beet growers in Colorado , Michigan and Utah , the House voted a 3 sugar rate ( Cuban : 2.40 ) . To stifle public outcry against this increase , yet give domestic sugar producers more " protection , " Senator Smoot 's Finance Committee proposed a world sugar rate of 2.75 ( Cuban : 2.20 ) . Senator Harrison of Mississippi , in the name of U. S. sugar consumers ( housewives ) who would pay an additional $54,000,000 per year under the proposed Finance Committee plan , moved that the existing rates be retained . <P> 48-to-38 . In the vote , the Harrison motion to retain the present sugar rates was , to the surprise of many , adopted 48-to-38 , rejecting the Finance Committee 's proposed increase . Nine Old Guardsmen , with only sugar consumers in their States and up for re-election this year , went over to the Coalition . Three Progressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Frazier of North Dakota ) supported a higher rate . Four Democrats ( King of Utah , Kendrick of Wyoming , Ransdell and Broussard of Louisiana ) joined the protectionist Old Guard . <P> Next day the Senate defeated ( 54-to-22 ) a proposal by Senator Howell to pay domestic sugar producers a bounty of .44 per lb. at a cost of ten million dollars per year to the U. S. Treasury . <P> " Simple Graft . " The Senate 's sugar vote was the culmination of a year 's efforts by high and low sugar lobbies . Last week Chairman Caraway of the Senate Lobby Committee reported on their activities . They had , he said , spent jointly some $400,000 to influence tariff legislation . Declared he : " The whole scheme is nothing but simple graft . . . . People might just as well go to a palm reader or a crystal gazer as to give their money to lobbyists . " <P> The committee found " no impropriety nor anything open to censure or criticism " in President Hoover 's behavior when the law-duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through personal connections . But it did consider " particularly reprehensible " the low-duty lobby 's effort to stir up hostility to the U. S. in Latin-America.
