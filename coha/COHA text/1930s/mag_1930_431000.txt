 | The Romance of Excavation Condensed from The World 's Work ( February , ' 30 ) Arthur Weigall Former inspector-general of antiquities to the Egyptian government WHEN I first went out to Egypt , I expected to dig a hole in the sand , find a doorway at the bottom , and walk through it into the presence of forgotten kings and queens . Actually my first season 's work was the roughest and most exhausting of my life . I was taken by the professor in charge to an untidy patch of earth and potsherds , into which a hundred native workmen were digging large holes ; and for the next few weeks my task was to map the position and depth of the quite uninteresting odds and ends which came to light and , at sunset , to measure up the work done , so that the professor could pay the men by the piece . As the holes grew deeper the earth became more moist , until at last the men were squelching in a liquid mud pie . Then , one blessed day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site were complete that we had cleared the sacred area of the local shrine of Osiris down to prehistoric level and had ascertained some very important facts in regard to the plan of the first settlement . Somewhat bewildered , I was then taken to a bare and sunscorched area of sand and told to set the men to digging one big hole . For many weeks , therefore , I sat each day on a rock and watched the clouds of dust rise into the pitiless sky . Then I was transferred to a cemetery site . The first grave which I entered a subterranean dome of brick collapsed about my head , and I was dragged out of the sand and debris only after I had given up all hope of ever seeing again the light of the sun . These and similar misadventures constituted the sorry tale of my first season 's excavating . But I was fortunate enough , later , to be appointed inspector-general of antiquities to the Egyptian government , with my headquarters at Luxor , the ancient Thebes . In this capacity it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , every important discovery . Moreover , excavations were being carried on every cool season in the Valley of the Tombs of the Kings , where the tomb of Tutankhamen was ultimately found . This undertaking was partly financed and conducted by a wealthy American gentlemen , Mr. Theodore Davis .  | Digging in this famous valley , of course , has been for many years the plum of the excavating business . Here one starts with certain assured facts . It was the royal burial ground only from the early part of the 18th Dynasty ( about 1520 B.C. ) , to the end of the 20th Dynasty ( about 1090 B.C. ) , and the exact number of Pharaohs who reigned between those limits , and whose tombs are therefore situated in this area , is known . The majority of these sepulchers have been robbed in ancient times and now lie open ; and in my time we knew exactly how many Pharaohs ' tombs were still hidden . All these missing tombs were found during my inspectorate , with the exception of that of King Tutankhamen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days after I had been appointed inspector-general , and while my predecessor was still in residence , the mouth of a tomb was unexpectedly laid bare . A flight of steps cut in the rock led down to a doorway blocked by a wall of stones , in the upper part of which was a hole big enough to permit us to obtain a glimpse of a corridor sloping steeply down into the darkness . We could just see another blocked doorway at the bottom , and when we had effected an entrance and had descended to this second walled-up doorway we found a hole in it through which we could look , with the help of our electric lamps , into a small chamber stacked to the ceiling with gorgeous furniture ablaze with gold . That night I sat on guard , gun in hand , over the mouth of the tomb , just about as excited as I have ever been in my life . I was little more than a boy at the time , and the weight of my responsibility very nearly throttled me . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed stones from the walls to effect an entrance . Our first object was to look at the inscriptions on the side of the catafalque to see whose tomb we had discovered ; and here we read the names of Prince Yuaa and his wife , Princess " Tuiu well-known historical characters , the father and mother of the great Queen Tiy , wife of Amenophis III ( 14061370 B.C. ) It was evident at once that thieves had been in the tomb before us , for the lids of the coffins had been lifted off , and the bandages had also been stripped from the faces of the two dead bodies clearly in order to get the gold necklaces ; and there was evidence to show that the robbery had been carried out immediately after the burial , probably by the " undertakers " themselves . In spite of the wonderful funeral furniture all around , I could  | not take my eyes off the Prince 's face . There he lay , like an old man asleep , his white hair thrown back from his wrinkled forehead , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his faintly smiling mouth looking as though the breath were still in his lungs , and on his chin an unshaved scrub of short hairs , indicating that he had been too ill to be attended by a barber on the last day of his life and that after his death the embalmers had not troubled to shave him . I held my lamp above his beautiful old face , and the trembling of my hand caused a flicker of shadow to move beneath his eyelashes , so that I started back , almost thinking that he was about to open his eyes . It was beyond the power of thought to realize that he had died before Greece or Rome had been heard of ; before Moses , even , had led the children of Israel out of Egypt . The Princess 's face was not so startling , but she too was wellpreserved , and her tumbled gray hair and expression of worry gave her a semblance of life which bridged the ages . She was astonishingly like somebody I knew . The objects buried in this chamber were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Prince 's chariot ; beside it were two comfortable-looking beds , with springy mattresses of crisscrossed string . There were three or four armchairs , including one which , so the inscription told us , had been presented to the Prince by the daughters of Queen Tiy and King Amenophis . One may suppose that the girls loved their old grandfather and had wanted to give him something useful to take with him into the next world . Boxes , chests , tables , soft cushions , vases , utensils , sandals were heaped up around the chamber . On one of the tables was an alabaster vase containing what appeared to be thick honey , still liquid ; it proved to be castor oil . The excitement of a discovery of this kind is extreme . Suddenly Mr. Davis uttered a groan and went off in a dead faint . When he came round , I expressed my regrets at his indisposition ; whereat he replied , " That 's all right ! I paid a pretty big sum of money for that sensation . " In the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wherein Queen Tiy herself had been buried ; but her body had later been removed and that of her son , the Pharaoh Akhnaton interred there in its place . The coffin was most gorgeous , being incrusted with semiprecious stones set in gold . The mummy was wrapped round with sheets of pure gold . Two seasons later we found the once magnificent tomb of the  | Pharaoh Haremheb , but it had been plundered in ancient times . Near the mouth of this tomb we discovered a rock-cut chamber wherein the Pharaoh 's dog and pet monkey had been buried . Originally they had been embalmed , but robbers in ancient times had stripped them of their embalming bandages and , as a joke , placed them so that the dog 's nose and the monkey 's were touching . " Well , " said Mr. Davis , as we stood staring at these two perfectly preserved friends of long ago , " it has taken 3000 years for anybody to see that joke . " Thus our researches proceeded , winter after winter ; but at length Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , employing Mr. Howard Carter as his trained excavator ; and after a few fruitless years the latter suddenly laid bare the mouth of the tomb of Tutankhamen , which proved to contain the richest mass of antiquities ever discovered together in Egypt . Every Pharaoh 's tomb must have once contained objects just as magnificent and costly ; but Tutankhamen 's was the only one which had escaped the attentions of the thieves of long ago . The jewel room in the Cairo Museum contains a collection of absolutely fabulous value , the bulk of which has been provided by legitimate excavation , but a considerable portion by chance finds . For example , a splendid group of jewels and gold and silver vases was discovered by a native who was riding a donkey . The animal tripped and flung its rider head-first into a heap of loose earth , from which he emerged , to his astonishment , with a golden bracelet in one hand and a silver pot in the other . During my first years in Egypt I used to see a great deal of Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work has become so justly famous . They had found that the coffins of the Greek period were made of a sort of papier-mache consisting of scraps of paper the contents of the waste-baskets of the town . By disintegrating these coffins and piecing together the torn-up fragments of paper they were able to present to the world volume after volume of private letters , documents , and literary fragments of tremendous interest , including seven new sayings of Jesus Christ part of a lost gospel . In handling the objects found I often experienced a sense of amazement at their seeming newness . I remember there was a toupee of hair , neatly curled at the fringe , which had belonged to one of Egypt 's first queens . She lived five thousand years ago , but the permanent wave had not yet come out .
