LOVERS A STORY BY HAM O'FLAHERTY I T WAS extremely hot . Old Michael Doyle had been to the shop to get an ounce of tobacco . Now lie found it difficult to make his way home . Leaning heavily on his stick , he walked slowly along under the shelter of a high wall that lined the road . " I 'm sorry now , " he grumbled , " I did n't send one of the youngsters to fetch it . " About a minute later he halted , straightened himself , and added : " But they might have kept the money . Awl ' t 's terrible the way I 'm treated in what used to be my own house . Aw I had better sit down and have a smoke . Christ in quarters ! Is n't it hot ? " He was seventy-seven years old . He had once been a man of great size , but now he was huddled together , an ungainly heap , as if all his limbs had been broken and disjointed and then stitched haphazard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn together in a bun , and his bleary eyes , through constant running , had made drains down his cheeks . His clothes were patched in an astonishing way . They did not fit and had obviously been cast off by his son and grandchildren . One of his grandsons was thirty years of age . With great difficulty he sat down under the shelter of the wall . When he stretched out his legs and crossed his feet the shadow of the wall reachedhalf way down his thighs . That was good . The upper part of his body was quite cool , and he sighed with content . " Aye ! " he said . " It 's a mortal terror how strength leaves a person . " He fumbled in his pocket for his pipe . It had got entangled in his handkerchief , so that came out , too , and with it everything that was in that pocket . He dropped the handkerchief beside him on the grass that grew under the wall . Then he got his knife out of the other pocket of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to open it and finally succeeded in doing so , by placing the edge of the blade against the sharp corner of a stone in the wall . " Hoick ! " lie said with pleasure , " I 'm not dead yet . Was n't that clever now ? " Then he began to clean the bowl of his pipe . He blew through the stem . It whistled . It was clear . Putting the pipe down beside him on the grass , he searched in his pockets for the ounce of tobacco he had just bought . It was nowhere to be found . He took off his hat and looked into the crown , without success , even though he fumbled under the band and pawed all over . He opened his waistcoat and then his shirt . He searched about his chest . The tobacco was nowhere . Then he grew excited and began to get to his feet , crying angrily : " That robber did n't give it to me . She took money and kept the tobacco . " As he was getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had dropped . There was a hard lump under it . He cried , " Ha ! Here it is . Who 'd ever think of it ? " So he settled himself down again , but in the effort to do so he dislodged the tobacco and then sat on it . When he examined the handkerchief , there was nothing in it . " Oh ! Well ! " he said . " There 's devilry in this . " He began to scratch his head and then again set about looking for the tobacco , prodding the grass with his stick and clawing with his hands . An old woman called Mary Kane , passing in the opposite direction , halted to watch him . She was seventy years old but quite brisk . Her face was withered like an old apple , but she still retained all her faculties . She wore boots with very high heels . It was obvious that she had once very beautiful legs and her carriage was that of a woman who was once beautiful . She wore a cashmere shawl that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a triangle , with the apex at her heels . In spite of the heat , she wore the shawl right out over her head , almost hiding her face . She halted in front of the old man and then , recognizing him , she threw back her shawl and made a dramatic gesture with her arms . " Bless my soul , " she said , " if it is n't Michael Doyle . Ah ! Musha , how are you , brother ? " The old man ; coked up slowly , shaded his eyes , and said : " God and Mary to you . What village are you from ? " " Arrah ! Do n't you know me ? " she said . " Pooh ! " said the old man . " I do n't know a person these days . They do be making fun of me . What village did you say ? " " D'ye mean to say ye do n't know Mary Kane ? " " Oho ! " said the old man . " Is that who you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " " Are n't you the artful creature ? " she said . " Do n't you know well I live alone and that I have nobody belonging to me , God help us ? " " Oho ! " said the old man . " Faith , I do n't know you at all . " " Oh ! " said the old woman , throwing out her arms . " Is n't he artful ? And what are you looking for , may I ask ? " " Eh ? What would I be looking for ? " " I saw you pawing about on the grass . " " Begob , strangers are curious . And what would you be watching me for ? " " You 're a sour old devil , Michael Doyle . " " Why would n't I be sour when I just lost my tobacco ? " " Haw ! " she said , jamming her arms against her hips and shaking herself with violence . " Sure I knew you had lost something and that you were pawing about for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's back you 're going to the cradle , you that were the pride of the parish . " " Begob , " he said , " whoever you are , you have the gift of the gab . But it 's strange anyways . A minute ago I had it in me hand . And now the devil has swallowed it . " " Let me search , " she said . " Search away , " he said . " You wo n't find a grain of it . " The old woman peered about sharply on the grass . " What 's this ? " she said , picking up a button . " Did it fall off your waistcoat ? " He peered at it . " It 's a button , " he said . " I found it and I 'm keeping it for a young fellow . They like buttons . I do keep buttons and give them to the children . Then they go messages for me . It 's cheaper that way than pennies . " " It 's nowhere to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to God , but I bet you 're sitting on it . Move your old bones . " She pushed him aside and found the tobacco , half buried in the grass . She held it up before his eyes in triumph . He grabbed it from her without a word of thanks . Having found his knife , he began to pare off some of the tobacco into the palm of his hand . She sat down beside him on her heels . He paid no attention to her but began to fill his pipe . She watched him closely , with her lips drawn back from her teeth and her eyes narrowed , after the manner of people who are in the habit of looking long distances out to sea . Then she said : " Now tell me on your soul , Michael , do n't you know me ? " He looked at her sourly and said : " Begob , you 're a great woman for arguing , so you are . " " I declare he does n't know me , " she said plaintively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's five years since I saw you last , Michael , and you knew me then , although you passed me by with a sour nod of salutation , same as you always did since my marriage . Even the misfortunes that I suffered did n't soften you . And now your memory has gone completely . Like grass in a flooded field , it 's buried under the weight of years . Ali ! Sure it breaks my heart to see you so , all withered like a rooted bush . And I that can remember the day when you had golden curls on your head and your eyes glittered like the sea with the sun full on it . Aye ! Death should come young to the unfortunate . They are foolish who weep over a young corpse . For it 's an unholy sight you are , all crippled and not knowing me . " Unheeding , the old man cracked a match and put it to his pipe and sucked , making a great noise each time his hollowed cheeks expanded . Smoke belched from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away the match , spat , and wiped his mouth on his sleeve . All his movements were uncomely . Yet the old woman watched him with a queer longing in her faded eyes . " This is queer talk you have , woman , " he said gloomily . " Who are you , anyway ? You 're from a strange village , I 'm thinking . " The old woman drew her s , - Liawl about her head once more and sniffed . She put a corner of her apron to her eyes . Taking his pipe out of his mouth , the old man looked at her closely . Then he spat , mumbled something , and pulled his hat farther down over his eyes . The old woman began to rock gently . " Not like you , " she said , " my memory gets sharper with old age . Like a sick nerve it stabs me when I 'm least expecting , and then I go dreaming sadly through the years . Sure the first day I set eyes on you is as plain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . I was milking the cows when you came by on a horse in the evening . You blessed me , and I looked up , and then you stopped your horse , and we began to talk and I gave you warm milk to drink out of the can . Musha ! There and then I belonged to you for the taking . Do n't you remember that evening ? " " Oho ! " said the old man . " What evening are you talking about ? " " Muslin , do n't you remember how we used to meet on the hill above my father 's house , how I used to run up the little road after nightfall , and you used to be waiting for me ? " " Pooh ! " said the old man . " The devil a bit o ' me remembers anything o ' the kind . There now . Sure I hardly ever stir out of the house . Me waiting for ye ! " " Sure it 's not to-day or yesterday I 'm talking about , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember it well . I was sixteen , and you were just turned twenty-three . Poor man , it 's all the drinking and fighting you did that brought you to this crippled state . " " Arrah ! Be easy with you , " said he . " What drinking did I do ? A few pints now and again . An odd glass of whisky . " " God forgive you , " she said . " You were four times in jail , not to mention the time you came with your relations and stole me out of the house with a strong hand and you gave Ned Kane such a beating with a stick that he spent three months in hospital and you got six months in jail for it . " " Who ? Me ? " he said , taking his pipe out of his mouth and looking at her intently . " Me in jail ? What for ? " " For nearly killing Ned Kane with a stick the night you took me . " The old man 's face suddenly lighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then brought his right hand down heavily on his knee . " Awl " he said , with great emphasis . " Ned Kane . I remember the dirty scoundrel . Hall ! Musha , the devil take him . If I hit him he deserved it . A dirty scoundrel from head to foot . Bcgob then , I did beat him and I beat him well . " He groped for his stick , clutched it , and said excitedly : " By my soul ! I do n't care who 's listening , but I 'll say this much . There was a day when I could beat with my bare hands any man in this parish that ever sucked at his mother 's breasts . " " But do n't you remember the night you came to the house ? " " Eh ? " said the old man . He scratched his head and still looked at her intently with his rheumy eyes . But his face gradually grew vacant and he said : " Well ! Now , ye drove it all out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get dizzy with this heat . They do be making fun of me about it . I put down my hat and I declare to God I ca n't find it a minute after . " " Ah ! God help you , poor man , " she said wearily . " But sure it 's me that is to be pitied more . Maybe if I had you in our youth it would n't be . There 'd be the cure of children to soften the falling years . There it is . Every bit of it is plain to me , alive like a blister . You came then with your uncle and two men from your village to ask for me , and my father gave you the door . ' Is it to a drunkard that has n't a shirt to his back I 'd give my daughter ? ' said he . We had four cows then and we were rich , and it was well known that I bad thirty acres of Iand and the stock and two hundred gold sovereigns for my portion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kane he wanted to give me and it was Ned I married in spite of everything . " " Tare an ' ouns , " said the old man crossly . " My pipe is gone out . " " Let it he , " she said , " and listen to me . Though you do n't remember or pretend you do n't , whichever it is , I 'll tell you the truth now , for it 's my first opportunity in all these years . When they wanted to marry me to Kane I came and told you , and you said you 'd take me if the devil was sitting on my bed counter . So there it was . Ned Kane came with his people and they were in the house making the match , when all of a sudden there was a clatter of horses outside , and you called out . It was dead of night . ' Come out , Ned Kane , ' says you , ' or faith you 'll come out a corpse . ' Your uncle Peter Timoney was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men too . Then you burst in the door and laid out whatever was there . Such shouting was never heard before or after . Then you barged into the room where I was with my mother and the women . My mother marked you with a tongs but nothing could stop you that night . And glad enough I was to go , too . Then you took me away behind you on the horse , but sure when the priest was awakened at the dawn he refused to marry us . Then the police came and we hiding at your uncle 's house and every man was arrested . Back I was brought . Oh ! That was the night . And d'ye mean to tell me , Michael Doyle , that you do n't remember it ? " The old man paused , with a lighted match to the bowl of his pipe . He looked up at her and then , without speaking , he drew at the pipe , lighted it , and threw away the match . " People do have great talk of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're always casting it in my face . But I daresay I was no worse than others . " He began to grumble while the old woman continued her story . " You went to jail then , " she said , " and when Kane came out of hospital we were married . What could I do ? Sure I had no hand or part in it . I 'd have gone with you anywhere . I used to cry my eyes out then , but there was nothing to be done . And , God forgive you , it was me you blamed for it . It 's been a long and lonely life of misery I had , with Kane drinking and routing whatever there was , all he could lay his hands on , until he died of sickness . Not a child blessed my hearth and hardly a relation is left to me now . And that 's the way it is . Nor you left to me either , nothing only a sad , sad memory of a love that was strangled in its cradle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shawl far out over her eyes . The old man moved about restlessly , looking at her from time to time , mumbling to himself . At last he said : " Poor woman , you have your sor-row . " " Aye , " she said . " It 's a load I carry with me always . This talking has made it heavier . I wish I passed you by . " She got to her feet , shook herself , and straightened out her shawl . She dried her eyes with her apron . Then she threw back her shawl and looked at him . Her eyes were red and her lips twitched . " Wo n't you say a gentle word to me , " she said , " before I go my road ? " He looked up at her stupidly . " God bless you , " he said . " And you , Michael , " she answered . " May you rest in peace . " She turned and walked away , her shawl in a triangle , her high heels tipping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his pipe . His withered countenance seemed to have lost all traces of human consciousness . It was apelike . His rheumy eyes , wrinkled like those of a gorilla , had no light in them . " Pooh ! " he said after a while . " What was that poor woman saying ? " He sat with his mouth wide open for another few minutes , as if trying to remember something . But his mind was a complete blank . Then he struggled to his feet and trudged homewards , walking on the grass by the wall in the shadow .
