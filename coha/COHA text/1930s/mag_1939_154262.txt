European typhus fever , also called " spotted fever ' ' and " ship fever , " is not to be confused with typhoid fever . For generations it was the scourge of armies , and it still flourishes in Poland , Russia and the Balkans . It is transmitted by lice and fleas ( hence delousing stations in the World War ) . The disease is due to a cosmopolitan virus called Rickettsia prowazeki , * which dwells in the intestines of the filthy little insects . Vaccines made from dead typhus viruses provide immunity from the disease , but such vaccines are difficult to make , for Rickettsia prowazeki can not be easily cultured in artificial mediums , thrives and multiplies best in its natural habitat . Chief European vaccine maker is Professor Rudolf Weigl of the University of Lemberg , Poland . Last week the Paris weekly Marianne described a visit to Professor Weigl 's laboratory . <P> Professor Weigl , said Marianne , ties a louse on a glass slide with a paper band , places it under a microscope . With a syringe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injects a tiny drop of solution containing the virus , previously procured from infected guinea pigs , into the louse 's intestinal opening . Then he imprisons the louse in a cage about the size of a matchbox , which has one side covered with fine silk gauze . Through the gauze the lice stick their mandibles . With these they suck blood from the arms of Professor Weigl and his wife ( who have already had typhus , are now immune ) . After a ten-day incubation period the lice are dissected . About 150 intestines are placed in a sterilized mortar with a few drops of glycerin and carbolic acid ( to assure sterility ) , and Dr. Weigl pounds the mess with a sterilized pestle . Result : one dose of immunizing typhus vaccine . At this rate , said Marianne , Professor Weigl makes less than one hundred life-saving doses a year . <P> From the U. S. Public Health Service last week came a new , streamlined mass-production method of culturing Rickettsia prowazeki . Bacteriologist Herald Rea Cox of the Rocky Mountain Laboratory at Hamilton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fertile , six-day-old chicken eggs with viruses of typhus fever as well as those of the related Rocky Mountain spotted fever , which occurs chiefly in Western States . <P> He used a thin needle , 1 inches long , which he passed through a tiny opening in the air-sac end of the egg . After he withdrew the needle , he sealed the hole with paraffin . In three or four days he removed the infected yolks , dried and ground them , diluted them in salt water , produced a remarkably virulent suspension of Rickettsiae , which lost none of its power when passed through ten series of eggs . " The technique , " said Bacteriologist Cox , " is very simple , and permits a minimum of contamination . " The simplicity of this operation should permit him to make thousands of doses of typhus vaccine in the time it takes Poland 's Weigl to make one . <P> <P> *Named after Howard Taylor Ricketts of Findlay , Ohio and Stanislas Josel Mathias von Prowazek of Germany , independent workers on the virus .
