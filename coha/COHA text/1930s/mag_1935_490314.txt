DIMINUTIVE NOTE : One of the most musical and at the same time unaccented subscribers to the New York Telephone Company is a lady who lives at 619 West 141 ) and whose name is Mrs. Grace Notes Shultz . You will find her on Page 888 of the directory . FISH culture , watching over the blessed events of a small colony of tropicals , has become so much a part of our life that it seems to have modified our character . Lambing time is always a strain  --  the long vigils and the extra work . So it is really not surprising that when a friend of ours phoned us at an early hour the other morning and announced that his wife had just borne a son , we replied dreamily , " Put her in another tank , " and went hack to bed . WE find it inspiring to live in a country in search of a system of government . The experts say that capitalism is on the way out ; the substitutes for it seem to be three in number  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Down at Atlantic City , where they are ready for the national sickness with an extra supply of wheel chairs , Secretary Wallace announced that both communism and fascism were apparently just as greedy and godless as capitalism . Our vote is for a system of government such as Dr. Shapiro reported finding on Pitcairn Island . There , in that remote and difficult island , which has no harbor and no ticket agency , things are hunky-dory . The people , two hundred of them , are tall and well and calm . They live communistically , but have not given up private property . In Pitcairn Island a man can own a canoe , a goat , or a plum tree , but he ca n't own a consolidated gas company or even a large fishing smack . Instead of paying taxes , he works a couple of weeks each year on a community project , such as a church . Now that is a sensible way to live . Our suggestion for America is to forget its hot shots , Father Coughlin and Mr. Long , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the first signs of disintegration have appeared : one of the islanders ( note that he is regarded as " brighter " than the others ) is tinkering with a radio . He 's ? t it so it almost works . WE 'RE not at all convinced that greatest need of the country is a new way of governing . Government is nothing but art expression of the people themselves : we live in the way that our peculiar tribal character dictates . Society is self-compensating ; laws and rules adjust to our dispositions and temper . This age is critical rather than creative , exhibitionist rather than strong . We all have brain fatigue from trying to solve the immediate problem , and gloom follows fatigue . Perhaps the greatest need of the country is a poem  --  the sort of thing that Finland celebrated the other day , its Kalevala . Come on , bards , our kingdom for a song  --  a song with hope in it , celebrating man 's great soul , not his confused state . THE Algonquin Hotel now em- ploys a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . Perhaps the management foresees the day when to have lunch at all will he a mark of distinction . It 's odd that with the food problem what it is in the world , hungry people in Duluth and Circleville arc still eager to hear who is sitting eating in a distant hotel . " The curiosity of a simian , " wrote Mr. Clarence Day one time , " is as excessive as the toil of an ant . " What 's more , it has a strong streak of triviality in it . Hail the Bandar-log at its dollar luncheon ! The price of the entree determines the price of the meal . This is Tallulah l3ankhead eating . FOOD , we understand , is going to cost considerably more this year than last , but there is always a silver lining to Economics ' cloud : somebody in England is taking out a patent on a new kind of phonograph record which is made of chocolate . When you are wearied of the record , you eat it . It is really a double solution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restore the peace of our own home , we were recently considering eating " You 're the Top , " even though it was made of the regulation material . SOMETIMES it startles us to recall in how many places we have left our name  --  just simple places like men 's clothing stores where they demand your name for their records . Nowadays it is impossible to do any shopping or skirmishing about without telling strangers your name , for their files . We were loafing around town during the noon hour the other day and went in and bought a pipe in a pipe shop . The girl , as she handed us our change , called brusquely for our name and address . " What possible use could our name and address be ? " we . asked in our simple country fashion . She replied that she wanted to keep a record of the shape of our pipe  --  which seemed odd , for it was a perfectly straight pipe , nothing fancy or irregular about it . Such strange entries there are , in the files @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Joan , the eight-year-old daughter of Deems Taylor , made her operatic debut at the Metropolitan last week , playing the part , which is purely pantomime , of Mimsey in the dream scenes of her father 's " Peter Ibbetson . " She had only one rehearsal for her appearance , and at this , after she 'd been coached in what to do , joined her mother in the auditorium , agog with excitement , and watched the other members of the company go through their roles . When the rehearsal was over , word came that she was wanted backstage . Quaking with pleasure , she turned to her mother . " Do you think they 're going to ask me to sign up ? " she asked . Our Feathered Friends WHEN we heard that the Museum of Natural History had acquired Lord Rothschild 's bird collection , consisting of two hundred and eighty thousand specimens , we dropped everything and hurried round for a look at them . We are ashamed to have to admit now that our eagerness was based on a profound misconception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eighty thousand stuffed birds under those glass hells people use . As a matter of fact , the birds are n't stuffed at all ; just laid out limply on metal trays . Their feet are tied together , and their necks sag , and they have n't any eyes ( it 's only fair to say that they have tags tied to them , telling what color their eyes would be if they had eyes ) ; they look very dead . Birds in this state are called " skins " by ornithologists . All study collections are made up of skins ; it 's only for public exhibition that the birds are stuffed , provided with glass eyes , and mounted on papier-miche twigs . Dr. Ernst Mayr , Associate Curaw of Birds , was a little severe about this ; pointed out to us that in Germany you have four floors of a museum devoted to study collections , and only one to public exhibitions , while here it 's usually the other way round . He 's going to remedy this situation partially , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always be open to people with any sort of legitimate interest in ornithology ? even , we suppose , suburban people . It 's going to take about three months for Dr. Mayr , assisted by half a dozen members of the LinnR .. an Society ( the local bird-lovers ' group ) , to unpack the entire collection and file it away in steel cases . When we were there , the floor was littered with excelsior and scraps of English newspapers which had been used for wrapping paper . Young men filed soberly past us with trays of dead owls and dead pigeons . The atmosphere was brisk and businesslike , and the rows and rows of steel cases ( there are two thousand , all told ) made the place look like a vast locker-room . Dr. Mayr is especially proud of the cases , because he had a hand in designing them . They have double steel walls , are dustproof , insect-proof , fireproof , and maintain a uniform temperature . Two men are working in the basement of the Museum making the thousands of trays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Mayr is young , alert , Teutonic , and , we have been told , very thorough . ( He spent three months working out his system of cataloguing and filing the skins . ) He 's had his share of field work with expeditions , and has discovered dozens of new birds . Once he spent two and a half months combing the Solomon Islands for a rare kind of crested pigeon . His search took him up and down a mountain which nobody had ever climbed before , but he did n't find a crested pigeon . The natives blamed the missionaries for the bird 's extinction ; said the missionaries brought cats with them , and the cats ate the pigeons . Shortly after this , Dr. Mayr dropped in on the Rothschild collection , then still in England , and there was the crested pigeon he had been looking for . The collection includes lots of other unique specimens ; and on the quantity side , it has six thousand burnming birds . It also has lots of secretary birds , honey creepers , boobies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Out of all the things that Dr. Mayr told us , we remember especially the story of how one kind of bird became extinct . It existed only on one island . One day an ornithologist who had been sent out for specimens of the bird landed on the island , saw eleven fine specimens sitting in a tree , and shot them . It later turned out that that was all there were on the island . Dr. Mayr would n't tell us what ornithologist it was , or what bird ; professional ethics , we guess . Affection ANOTHER inexplicable fragment of overheard conversation , this one spoken by one lady to another just stepping out of an elevator in the St. Regis as a friend of ours was stepping in : " She loves people more than anyone else I know , " one of them said . " And when she says ' Saginaw , ' she says it with a caress . " Goalie THE best hockey goalies stop the puck nineteen out of twenty tones that it 's hurled at them , on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four times a game , on an average . On an average , Dave Kerr , present goalie of the New York Rangers , has been making between thirty-five and forty stops a game this season , and that is one thing that sets him apart from other goalies . He handles a lot more chances , the principal reason for this being that the Rangers play a wide-open game . His percentage of stops made is n't the highest in the league  --  three other goalies have a slightly higher score than his approximate .950 ? but this is discounted , on the theory that he- has to play a much harder game and tires.a little toward the end . At any rate , since he started with the Rangers last December , they rose from the bottom to the top of the American division in the hockey league , and he 's supposed in hockey circles to have had a lot to do with it . Kerr is twenty-five , boyish-looking , and handsome , except for a broken ( three times ) nose , which he says there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game . He started competitive hockey when he was ten , in a division for boys under fifteen , and was the youngest player on his team . He played goalie because he 'd been given a set of pads and a goal stick fur Christmas . As his team moved up through the age groups , he continued to be the youngest . One night , when he was thirteen , he was goalie for his team , which was competing for the junior championship of Ontario , and scored a shutout , and then goaled for an intermediate-group team and scored another shutout . At seventeen , he captained the Montreal A.A.A. team which won the amateur championship of Canada and made a record of one defeat in twenty-one games ; Kerr made eleven shutouts and allowed only thirteen goals to be scored against him . The next season he turned professional , joining the Maroons , then played for Windsor and the Philadelphia Arrows . The Maroons got him hack in 1932 , when they needed help desperately . He helped them from near the bottom to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patrick of the Rangers resolved to get him , and did , by paying ten thousand dollars to the Maroons , a record price for a goalie . In the cage , Kerr is all attention , chewing gum rapidly , and , when the play is far away , leaning forward with his stick across his bent knees . Except when in action , there is no particular expression on his face . He indicates excitement only by constantly adjusting his clothing . When the usual fist fights take place , he leans back on the net , chews , and looks bored . He is said to he the only left-handed goalie in organized hockey at the moment . He 's left-handed only to the extent that he swings his stick that way ; he does everything else right-handed . He has a twelve-yearold brother who seems to be headed for a goal job , and he 's left-handed all the way through . Two other brothers , twenty-two and eighteen , are both hockey-players but not goalies ; they 're right-handed . Kerr 's highest total of stops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The record , held by Jakie Forbes , formerly of the New York Americans , is seventy-one . That Was the Trouble ASUBURBAN matron took her car out without chains on the iciest day of last week and of course got stuck in the first place she parked . As she was struggling to get away , growing madder and hotter by the minute , two women passersby stopped to watch her , and one of them finally rapped on the window . Our lady lowered the glass and leaned out . " Your rear wheels are just spinning around , " the woman said , and went on , happy in her knowledge that she had done her good deed for that day . Sidewalk Pictures ONE of our operatives has been investigating the sidewalk photographers who arc always popping up in front of people . He began by accepting a coupon from one of the cameramen , which directed him to send twenty-five cents to the studio for three prints of his picture . This clue led him eventually to Mr. Robert A. Winkler of the CinCsnap Laboratory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the biggest sidewalk-picture man in the business . He has six photographers on the street in New York , a shop for repairing cameras , a printing plant for turning out coupons , automatic film-developing devices , files of over a million snaps , and branches in Newark and Chicago . Mr. Winkler comes from Alsace , and is youngish and a bachelor . His big thought came to him in his native Strasbourg , and by 1928 pedestrians in Germany , Switzerland , and France were stumbling over his photographers , and a goodly number of people were sending in the equivalent of twenty-five cents for their prints . People kept telling Winkler that he ought to go to the United States , and in 1929 he did , selling out his Euro pean interests . He got off to a had start , and in 1932 had only four dollars left , but things picked up from that point and now they could n't be better , except that there are twenty-seven other outfits snapping pictures in New York now , and the number will probably be doubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All you need to set yourself up in business is a secondhand movie camera , some film , coupons , and an address . Twenty-five dollars will cover it in a pinch . The cameramen are , of course , the backbone of the sidewalk-photo industry . Working , as they do , on a commission basis  --  usually five cents an order  --  it 's to their interest not to waste time on unlikely subjects . Hence they develop a knowledge of human nature as profound as that of a syndicated newspaper columnist . Here , in the descending order of probability , is a lineup of the prospects : Negro in uniform , couple with dog , man and child , woman and child , man with dog , woman with dog , two or more business girls giggling , two or more matrons , two or more men , solitary woman , solitary man . Racially , Negroes are always the best prospects , when they have a quarter . Italians are good , too . Germans are bad , Chinese hopeless . It 's doubtful if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Out-of-towners are better than New Yorkers . Moderately well-dressed people are better than the very spruce or the very shabby . Each photographer snaps an average of twelve hundred pictures a day , and the best a week . Sales are completed on about eight per cent of the coupons handed out , and thirty per cent of the prospects refuse to be handed the coupon . Once in a while somebody tries to smash the camera , or bring suit , on the ground that his privacy has been violated . But as long as the photographers do n't put their pictures to any wrongful use , they 're safe ; they do n't even know who their subjects are , they point out , until they write in for prints . There is an ordinance against soliciting business by passing out printed matter on the sidewalks , and occasionally a cameraman is brought into court ; in general , though , the police are lenient . Sometimes people who have been snapped walking with people they should n't be walking with come in , sheepishly order some prints , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the photographers , all men of the world and gentlemen , destroy the negatives , which the erring ones have forgotten to ask for . Yachtsman ALOCAL yacht-broker got an inquiry the other day from Massachusetts concerning a yacht which he had advertised in one of the boating magazines and , things being as they are in the trade , decided that nothing would be left to chance in his follow-up . The town from which the gentle-man wrote was near Boston , he knew , so he took the night train up there and , after breakfast in the station , got a taxi and rode about twenty miles into the suburbs . The local post office sup-plied the information that the gentleman in question was connect-ed with a preparatory school on the edge of the village , and there the broker drove and asked for his prospect . In a few minutes he ap-peared , quite bewildered at first and then quite embarrassed . He was about twelve years old and , it turned out , had been in study hall when summoned . He had n't really wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just been " inquiring . " Under the circumstances , the broker was heroic . Said it was quite all right , of course , and left his Weather Man 's Gadgets TN case you 've been wondering how the Weather Bureau measures snowfall , we 'll tell you : they go outdoors with a yardstick and stick it in the snow , doing their best to avoid drifts . It 's only fair to add that they also have a more complicated and scientific way of doing it . There 's an apparatus with a bucket . This latter is set outdoors , where it catches the snow and melts it , the depth of the water being recorded on a chart indoors . At temperatures from twenty degrees to freezing , one inch of water means ten inches of snow . The colder it is , the fluffier the snow , and the less water it makes . There 's a density gauge which keeps track of this , and which we wo n't try to explain to you . Point is , when all this melting and charting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out and stick a yardstick in the snow , and a darn sight simpler . We found out about this , and some other things , by calling on Mr. David R. Morris , the chief meteorologist at the Central Park observatory . We 'd been at the main observatory on Battery Place , but never at the one in the Park before . We discovered several new things . For one , the building itself was built by Boss Tweed , who named it the Watch Tower . For years it was a favorite picnic spot , but it finally degenerated into a rendezvous for hoodlums , and the city locked it up in 1900 . The Weather Bureau moved in in 1920 , getting it rent free . Mr. Morris has been there ever since , and long ago became reconciled to the impossibility of getting any lunch in the neighborhood . He just nibbles chocolate , or drinks Bovril , and goes home early in the afternoon . His precipitation readings always jibe with those taken down at Battery Place , in spite of the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the open , and that it 's always cooler in the Park . Meteorological observatories are pretty impressive places . You can get a little light-headed in the presence of so many delicate , inhuman instruments busily engaged in making precise dots and lines on miles and miles of graph paper . Our favorite instrument is the humidity gauge , because it 's the most earthy . It seems that human hair  --  particularly blonde female hair  --  is sensitive to moisture .. So the gauge consists of a hank of blonde hair strung between two poles , with a tiny lever resting on it , in a little shed outdoors . On dry days the hair tightens , moving the lever up ; on wet days it sags , letting it down . All this is recorded on a chart a couple of hundred feet away , in the observatory . We did n't discover just how . Incidentally , it seemed to us that the hair could have done with a shampoo  --  that the whole instrument , in fact , was a hit on the rusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , it seems , can think of lots of things it needs at the moment before it needs a new humidity gauge . Mr. Morris seemed to be waiting for us to ask if the climate was n't changing , so we did . By way of answer he brought out a chart of New York 's average yearly temperature for the last six decades . What it all amounts to is that we 've had our ups and downs in the way of hot and cold spells , but the average yearly temperature has n't changed a hit . And it is n't likely to . We got the final figures on January 's big snowfall-17.5 inches . It 's tied with a February , 1920 , storm as second only to the 1888 blizzard-20.9 inches . Dernier Cri GENTLEMAN declares he went into De Pinna 's the other day to get an electric clock . He was doing all right with the salesgirl when an older lady came up and joined them , apparently an executive of some sort . She knew quite a hit about the clocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A.C. wiring . " Alternating current , " she explained . " It 's the thing now , you know . "
