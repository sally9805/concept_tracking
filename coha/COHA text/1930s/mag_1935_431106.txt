 | FROM a cruising blimp a quarter of a mile above the Potomac we gazed down upon the new Washington . As always , the simple grandeur of the White House , the Capitol , the Lincoln Memorial , and the towering Washington Monument , now freshly washed with soap and water , drew the eye and made the heart beat faster . But near them new wonders had appeared . Quietly and steadily , with so little fuss that residents were hardly aware of it , thousands of carloads of stone and metal ? whole mountains in the aggregate ? have been hauled into the city and reared into monumental buildings . Acres and acres of old , unsightly structures have been razed on Capitol Hill , around its base , and along broad , historic Pennsylvania Avenue . In their place stretch parks , wide boulevards , or long , handsome houses of government . In the angle formed by the intersection of Pennsylvania Avenue and the new Constitution Avenue , beautiful Champs-Elysees or Rue de Rivoli of Washington , rises a mighty wedge of masonry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ( page 483 ) . TWENTY MILES OF CORRIDORS In this single group is the most amazing collection of Government buildings that the world has seen . They make their own weather . In hottest summer the air inside is cooled to the temperature of a fine spring clay . Beneath the roofs of this Triangle , I knew , worked 17,700 Government employees , about as many as the entire population of Batavia , New York , or Daytona Beach , Florida . Every day dozens of people get lost in its 20 miles of corridors . In sheer size the cluster of buildings was staggering , even from high above . It was as if half a dozen or more of New York 's tallest skyscrapers had been laid on their sides , formed into a blunted arrowhead , and cut and twisted to make courts and wings . One unit ? the Commerce Department ? is longer than the Chrysler Building is tall . But it was not merely an impression of bigness that we had in the wandering blimp . Long ranks of majestic columns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls give a beauty and simplicity that make these enormous newcomers fit companions for the classic White House and Capitol . " How long will these new buildings last ? " I had asked the man in charge of them . " It is just a question of how long limestone will withstand the elements , " was the reply . A MARBLE TEMPLE OF THE LAW The airship turned , and far off in the distance , beyond the Capitol dome , appeared a gleaming white marble temple , comparable in beauty even to the noble Lincoln Memorial . This is the new United States Supreme Court Building , the only real home of its own that the Nation 's highest court has had ( pages 458 and 462 ) . For the first time in American history a citizen now might gaze upon the separate , permanent abodes of the three branches of his Government ? legislative , the Capitol ; executive , the White House , and now , for the judicial , long sheltered in the old Senate chamber , this temple whose dignity and impressiveness match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown , and is growing still ! New offices have been added to the White House . They are even talking about enlarging the Capitol , carrying out a plan envisioned more than 70 years ago ( see page 458 and Color Plate V ) . In those huge new buildings downtown , thousands of brains and hands are needed to help do the work of a modern President . The 136 clerks who made up the entire staff of employees when first the American Government moved to the new Federal City by sloop and stagecoach in 1800 could be tucked away and lost in a single wing .  | As we cruised about , other splendid white buildings appeared , new jewels in the familiar setting along the Potomac . Beyond the Lincoln shrine the new Arlington Memorial Bridge links North and South . Down the Virginia shore of the winding river a wide Appian Way , the Mount Vernon Memorial Highway , leads to the home and tomb of the Father of his Country . From the steps of the Capitol all the way down to the river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch of tree-dotted park land . Gone is much of the mushroom growth of temporary wartime structures . Their removal gives new beauty to this Mall , main feature of the grand plan conceived by the Revolutionary soldier-artist , Maj. Pierre Charles L'Enfant , when he laid out this city with broad , sweeping , prophetic strokes to be the capital of a vast country . I wished he might ride with me today . Hanging there between earth and sky , we seemed suspended in history , halfway between the past and the unfathomable future . How would the city look a hundred years hence , or twenty , or a thousand ? " Say , can you swing the tail around a little bit ? I want the Capitol to move over into the center of this shot . " The voice of my photographer companion broke in upon my reverie . I came back to the remarkable present , when men fly about the sky and nonchalantly command the United States Capitol to " move over . " For an hour we flew , " shooting " pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now idling our motors deferentially over the Capitol lest their roar disturb the Congressmen at weighty work below , now cruising up and down the Mall , while the airship 's shadow raced along the ground . MAGIC CHANGES ON CAPITOL HILL For months now , returning travelers from Timbuktu or Tehran and pilgrimaging citizens from Dodge City or Dubuque have been pausing on emergence from Washington 's Union Station and uttering exclamations of admiration and surprise . No wonder ! Instead of ugly brick walls and tar-paper shacks of World War vintage , a splendid park cut by wide drives sweeps 1  | across to the Capitol . In the midst of the magnificent Plaza , if it be summer , a fountain plays , its water glowing with subdued colored lights ( see illustration , page 471 ) . The Senate Office Building , off there at the left , has had its face lifted ? and a handsome face it now is , with a long row of Roman Doric columns . A streetcar line that once marred the scene dips discreetly underground . Beneath a broad lawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be parked . But to look upon the latest crowning glory of Capitol Hill one should stand on the front steps of the Capitol , where presidents are inaugurated , and see the new Supreme Court Building , its beauty heightened by the green of trees and grass . It occupies a historic site . Early patriots in powdered wigs forgathered at a famous old hotel run by William Tunnicliff on this spot before the War of 1812 . After the British burned the Capitol in 1814 , a building erected here housed Congress until the marks of the torch were erased . In Civil War times it was used as a military prison . A SINGLE STONE WEIGHS 45 TONS Everything about the Supreme Court 's home is on a majestic scale . " Look at those blocks of marble , one at each side of the steps , " said a Government man who supervised its construction . " Each block weighs 45 tons . They are two of the heaviest marble blocks ever brought into Washington . " The two bronze doors weigh 3,000 pounds apiece . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above them catches the eye , not alone for its size , but for its interesting sculptures in which the features of historic or living men are recognized ( see illustrations , pages 463 and 465 ) . Inside the massive bronze portals a main hall lined with 36 stately columns ? each made from one solid piece of stone ? leads to the courtroom where the nine black-robed Justices will sit . At their own request , the room was made only about 60 per cent larger in floor area than the present Supreme Court room in the Capitol . Richly colored marble columns and sculptured panels lend beauty to the lofty chamber , 45 feet from floor to ceiling .  |p464  Behind the courtroom are the quarteredoak-paneled offices of the Justices , each of whom will have about as much space as all have together now in the crowded Capitol . Only three have offices there at all , and most of the members of the Court do much of their work at home . To assure the Justices privacy , the new building 's corridors can be closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General , who now have barely space enough for their brief-cases when they come to the Capitol to appear before the Court , are provided with spacious offices . Under the courtyards are garages ; out of sight is apparatus for conditioning the air in most parts of the building ; there are dining rooms for Justices and a cafeteria for visitors , council rooms for attorneys , and numerous libraries ? space for 379 , - 726 of the law 's voluminous tomes . In the Folger Shakespeare Library , down the street , reposes a fine collection of books and Elizabethan treasures , even the supposed corset of Queen Elizabeth , solemnly stowed away in a vault and shown only to a chosen few ( pages 466-7-8 ) . DOUBLING THE WORLD 'S LARGEST LIBRARY Behind the Library of Congress a broad space is being excavated for an annex almost to double its capacity , although already it is the largest library in the world , with 9,841,494 books , pamphlets , pieces of music , and other items at the latest count . Down from Capitol Hill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first one , the trail of the new Washington leads to Pennsylvania Avenue . In some of its now vanished buildings ? masses of rubble and ruined walls then ? the first bricks flew in the " bonus army " riots of 1932 . Halfway along " The Avenue , " between the Capitol and White House , there stretched off to the left in the early days of the city a dreary swamp where Washingtonians were wont to shoot " reedbirds. "  |p465  Later the swamp was filled in , and the old Center Market , dubbed the Marsh or " Ma'sh " Market , was erected there . When I came to Washington four years ago , ramshackle market buildings still occupied the spot , and thousands of rats inhabited the premises which had long been a cornucopia for them . An energetic Government hit upon this location as a key point in its building program . Here would rest the tip of the Federal Triangle . Wrecking operations began . Scientific Pied Pipers from the Agriculture Department disposed of the rats , which at first devoured the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a structure in many ways unique ? the National Archives Building ( see illustration , page 483 ) . Here for the first time is a worthy , safe , and permanent home for the precious records of the Nation , some scrawled in faded ink on yellowed paper by early patriot hands , others punched out on modern typewriters , or even contained in sound motion-picture films which will be preserved and shown here . To guard against deterioration ? to keep Father Time at bay as long as possible ? both sunlight and natural air will be barred from the archive storage sections , which are windowless . ANCHORING A BUILDING FOR ALL TIME A person shut up there the year around would never know at first hand whether it was summer or winter , day or night , for the only light will be artificial and the temperature will be kept constantly about i2 degrees . The air will be cleansed and excess moisture wrung out , lest it shorten the life of the paper . " What is the life expectancy of such a building ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last forever , " came the answer . Forever ! Yet this was a structure built not upon rock but on land that once had been a swamp . By what engineering miracle was it possible to achieve firmness of foundation ? I found out . This building stands upon an enormous " scow " of reinforced concrete five feet thick , sunk deep into the ground and supported on more than 5,000 concrete piles  |p466  ranging from 15 to 35 feet long . But Washington is low , and this basal structure goes far down below the level of the Potomac . Under ordinary conditions the several strata of clay and gravel would keep the water out . But suppose the Potomac should rise in flood . Would not the incalculable power of the rising water lift the gigantic scow , building and all , and float it off down Pennsylvania Avenue ? Or , if that is too overdrawn a picture , could it not at least move and crack this important structure ? All this the architects foresaw . In the center of the concrete scow they left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric pumps and a steam turbine . If the water rises above a certain level , it automatically kicks one of the pumps into action . If it climbs still higher , the second electric pump comes to the rescue . And if the flood increases , the mighty steam turbine goes into battle with almost enough power to pump out the whole Potomac . Through a main nearly nine feet in circumference the water would go belching back to the river whence it came . A 120-TON STONE MAKES A GLADIATOR Every piece of stone in the structure was chosen and laid with the idea of permanency . The base is granite from West Chelmsford , Massachusetts . For the superstructure an entire new bed of limestone was opened at Bedford , Indiana . The largest and finest stones ever quarried in this country were sought . Two giant blocks weighing 120 tons apiece were hewn from Indiana 's limestone hills . But they could not be shipped ? not without enlarging railroad tunnels and strengthening bridges all the way from Bedford to Washington . Forthwith the sculptors went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a mere 90 tons . When the blocks reached Washington , it was found there was no rig big enough to pick them off the cars , and again the sculptors got busy . Working right in the railroad yards , they knocked off enough this time to bring each block down to 60 tons . Now you may see them , flanking the main entrance on Constitution Avenue . The rock on the right has been carved in the form of a Roman gladiator , guarding the approach with sword and shield . On the other side is a female figure , holding a child , with a sheaf of wheat in the background , portraying fertility .  |p467  On entering this Archives Building , all documents will be fumigated , not so much to guard against disease germs as to end the activities of bookworms and their ilk which might eat through priceless pages . Exactly what are the archives which will be stored here ? The official answer has not yet been given . The two prime United States documents , the Declaration of Independence and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Congress . In various buildings are numerous other records . " FEET . . . LIKE . . . LOTUS FLOWERS " For instance , there is a letter that came from the Court of Burma in 1856 , seeking a treaty of amity and commerce . That effusion , encased in the carved and hollowed tusk of an elephant , says : " We , who are the Ministers and Generals of the King of Burma , the Overlord of all the kings of the Orient , the most Powerful Sun-rising King , the Lord of Saddan Elephant King , the Lord of Many White Elephants , and the Great Righteous Ruler ; and we who are doing homage to the King by bowing our heads to his Golden Feet which are like the Paduma lotus flowers , write this letter to the President and Ministers who are the rulers of both Washington and the countries of the West . " One can imagine President Lincoln 's enjoyment of a letter in which the King of Siam offered to stock the United States with elephants to roam in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of burden . All the United States had to do was to send a steamship and the King would provide the cargo of young males and females , he explained . giving grave directions for the care and feeding of elephants en voyage . With careful courtesy and apparently a straight face , Mr. Lincoln replied that his country 's political jurisdiction " does not reach a latitude so low as to favor the multiplication of the elephant , and steam on land as well as on water has been our best and most efficient agent of transportation in internal commerce . " The royal elephant offer had been dispatched by the " Blessing of the Highest Super-Agency of the Whole Universe , the King of Siam , the Sovereign of all Interior Tributary Countries Adjacent and Around in Every Direction , " but the American President signed himself simply , " Your good friend , Abraham Lincoln . "  |p468  At the State Department also , where few now see them , are such documents as the Emancipation Proclamation , bound with a red and blue silk ribbon , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribbon and red seals . TONS OF ALUMINUM ADORN JUSTICE Across from the Archives Building toward the White House is the Justice Department 's splendid new structure of stone and sleek gray metal ( see illustration , page 483 ) . When the Washington Monument was being completed in 1884 , a proud citizenry capped it with 100 prized ounces of a precious metal , aluminum . It cost a dollar and ten cents an ounce , almost exactly the same as silver then . Earlier , French plutocrats vied for possession of aluminum forks and spoons more highly valued than solid gold . With this in mind , a sight of the Department of Justice Building is astounding . In it there is enough aluminum to make not only forks and spoons but pots and pans for a whole city . If the metal today cost what it did when the Washington Monument was crowned , the amount used in this single building would be worth some $8,500,000 . Instead , it cost between $400,000 and $450 , - 000 , and that includes not only the metal but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an important part in developing the electrical reduction process by which modern scientific alchemy now transforms one of the commonest elements in the earth 's crust into shining metal on such a scale that we see it on every hand . A caller at the Justice Department swings open aluminum doors some 20 feet high ( see page 464 ) , boards an aluminum elevator , looks appreciatively at bas-reliefs cast in aluminum , runs his hand along Great Court , half the size of most city blocks , is a large aluminum fountain .  |p469  The gray metal adds an air of modern sophistication to a structure which in architectural feeling is Greek , with dignity and refinement its keynotes . It is impressive in size as well . A stroll around its limestone and granite walls would mean a walk of nearly half a mile , and inside are two miles of corridors . CRIME FOUGHT BY THE " G " MEN Most spectacular and interesting of all the activities housed in the Justice Department is the work of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , whose long arms have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the country . " I want to see one of the G ' men . " " Let 's see if we can get a permit to see the files where they keep the fingerprints , or look at Dillinger 's bulletproof vest . " With such comment , sight-seers already are finding their way in numbers to the first permanent home that the Justice Department has had since its organization . Their desires can be fulfilled , though few recognize the crack Government agents ? known through the country as " G " men ? who are accomplishing the most against crime . A small , quiet man they may pass in the hall has killed three criminals in gun fights and sent several notorious swindlers to prison . On view here are some of the unbelievably murderous weapons desperadoes use . " With this machine gun you could stand on the steps of the Treasury and shoot right through the engine block of an auto on Capitol Hill , " an agent told me . One deadly exhibit is a 20-gauge doublebarreled shotgun which its gangster owner sawed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close range , it could hardly miss . Up at the top of the building are the millions of fingerprints with which Uncle Sam can tell a criminal things about his life that he may have forgotten himself . Many a desperate public enemy has tried to erase the tiny telltale ridges and whorls from his fingertips with knife or acid . But they always grow back just the same . In a constant stream from police and prisons all over the country come sets of fingerprints , at the rate of 2,500 a day . Every time one is filed , a little light flashes , and it is blinking constantly . A few moments of quick , deft work , and the owner of the prints is identified absoNEW WASHINGTON 469 lutely if he has a criminal record ; and 47 per cent of them have ! These experts do n't even look at the name the fingerprinted man may have given . Men and names may lie , but fingerprints never ! Machinery does its part . There is a bank robbery . A scared teller sees that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a small mustache and a scar at the right side of his mouth . The Department has a special file of 10,000 public enemies ? bank robbers , kidnapers , murderers . Each card includes a coded description . These can be fed through an electric searching machine , set to eliminate the thin men , fat men , short men , tall men , and to pick out the ones with scars . The " mechanical detective " may produce 20 or so , and from the pictures of these men on file the teller is able to select the one he saw . I leafed through a voluminous nickname file : Ace in the Hole , Johnny Dingdong , Butterfat , Cross-Town Slim , Crookie , Australian Jimmy , Baby Face ( there were several of them ) , Bad Egg . These are names that have stuck in underworld channels . Suppose you are kidnaped and hear one of your captors say , " Look here , Pretty Boy . " With that nickname and this file , the " G " men can accomplish wonders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of machine in the world , even those in foreign languages , including the Arabic . There are well-equipped laboratories ; files of paper watermarks , handwriting , and even tire treads . In the new building this important Federal Bureau has elbow room . In the old rented quarters men searching the files used to bump their heads against the ceiling . TAXES REPLACE STEAMED OYSTERS Across the street from Justice stands the Government 's immense house of taxation , home of the Bureau of Internal Revenue . It was the first of all the Triangle buildings to be occupied , but it is the last to be finished , because it is still growing . Already the building is so big that it has to have charts in the entrance lobby to give visitors their bearings . When completed , it will rival the enormous Commerce Building in size . On the site of the new wing stood Harvey 's , sacred to the steamed oyster which was supposed to have been " invented " here . To the original Harvey 's Oyster House , once 472 THE NATIONAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife came with other dignitaries to sample the novel delicacy . General Grant had a favorite seat in the Harvey 's Restaurant that replaced it in 1866 , and other famous patrons included Presidents Garfield , Arthur , Roosevelt , and Taft . Here also once stood the Capital 's first playhouse , the Washington Theater , later a dancing academy and assembly hall where several ante-bellum presidents held inauguration balls . A visitor to Washington in 1826 recorded that in a public ball here at Carusi 's he " saw the waltz introduced into society for the first time . " One day in 1859 Postmaster General Joseph Holt , scribbling a routine Government report , dipped his pen in the purple rhetoric of his time and wrote : " The Post Office Department , in its ceaseless labors , pervades every channel of commerce and every theatre of human enterprise , and while visiting , as it does kindly , every fireside , mingles with the throbbings of almost every heart in the land . " In the amplitude of its beneficence it ministers to all climes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readiness and with equal fullness of fidelity . It is the delicate ear trump through which alike nations and families and isolated individuals whisper their joys and their sorrows , their convictions and their sympathies , to all who listen for their coming . " Little did he dream that the words would be carved in stone around the arcade of a monumental Post Office Department Building . Yet there they are , flanked by inscriptions noting the growth of the Postal Service from " Colonial Post 1691 " and " Continental Post Office 1775 " to " Air Mail 1918 . " ONE ISSUE OF THE GEOGRAPHIC WOULD FILL A 15-CAR MAIL TRAIN How the imaginative Holt would thrill to the magic of modern air mail ! In his day light pony express riders were racing over the plains , depending upon their speed to save them and their precious mail from hostile Indians . The United States postage stamp ? so cheap and so taken for granted now ? was only 12 years old , and registered mail was a novelty in operation just four years . Today the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 237,600 . The National Geographic SoGRAPHIC MAGAZINE SPRING ciety , largest private user of the postal facilities in Washington , every month mails a million magazines . A single issue fills about 15 mail cars . They go out in waves , timed to reach members in far foreign countries and in near-by places almost simultaneously . In addition , The Society alone sends each week-day an average of 34 bags of first- and third-class mail . Sometime perhaps , hundreds of years from now , future generations of builders or wandering archeologists may come this way and split open the cornerstone of this Post Office Department Building . If so they will find a bewildering array of information and objects , including the Bible , the Constitution of the United States , the American flag , Washington newspapers , and a medallion bearing the likeness of President Hoover . They were sealed inside on an autumn day A. D. 1932 . YOUNG LABOR AND COLOSSAL COMMERCE Along Constitution Avenue for two whole blocks sweeps the columned front of the Interstate Commerce Commission , central connecting wing , and Labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( illustration , page 482 ) . At the lofty cream and gold auditorium in the center , workmen were adding the final touches when I walked through . Labor , the youngest Department , was just moving in from its rented quarters . Hung on the spick-and-span corridor walls were vivid Public Works of Art Project pictures ? hands grappling with machinery as if to keep insensate cogs and wheels from throwing flesh and blood out of work ; tenement streets and railroad yards ; workingmen with the dignity of self-respecting labor . Across the street in the building that is the colossus of them all , I called upon Commerce , that enormous modern Government Department whose servants count the Nation 's noses , go down into steamship boilers and up among the air lanes , guard liners from icebergs , map the ocean floor around our coasts and keep the beacons burning , watch over fish and Alaska seals , record the triumphs of inventive genius , help extend the romance of modern trade and preserve its standards . Its massive home forms the base of the Triangle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carloads of Indiana limestone , 150 carloads of Connecticut granite milled in Massachusetts , 1,400 tons of Missouri and  |p481  Vermont marble , and additional tons of other kinds of stone from Minnesota , Colorado , and Georgia . Enough concrete piles to form a line eighty miles long if laid end to end support it ? some 13,000 of them . " In this building we have the world 's largest precision camera for map reproduction , " a Coast Survey employee told me . Anyone who thinks of a camera as something to be carried in a vest pocket or set up on a tripod should see this one . It weighs 14 tons and fills a whole room . " Why do they need such a big one ? " visitors ask . " Accuracy , " is the answer . With the old camera it was necessary to make several photographs and piece them together . This one makes negatives more than four feet square , and it is accurate to a thousandth of an inch . One can see almost anything in this Commerce Building ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? including an aquarium . In a big room at one end of the building are recorded the millions of patents which have helped give us such miracles as the telephone and electric light . Here is a copy of the first patent issued in America . It was granted by Massachusetts in 1646 to Joseph Jenkes of Lynn for a water mill . Early patents granted under the United States Government included new ways of making candles ; flour and meal ; type for printing ? and an improvement in distilling . An inventor in the old days had to supply a model , even if his brain child was a locomotive . One model , now in the Smithsonian Institution , shows a device to enable steamboats to lift themselves over sand bars . It was invented by Abraham Lincoln ! SOFT-COAL SMOKE IS DRY-CLEANED In my wanderings over the new Washington , I thought it strange that I found no furnaces . Then I learned that most of these buildings , including the White House and the mighty Triangle structures , have their own private sun ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cross floor area of 380 acres . There were no belching black clouds of smoke in sight as I approached that handsome structure of buff brick and limestone on one of the winter 's coldest days . Out of the wide but low smokestacks drifted instead a light vapor which looked like steam , for the soft-coal smoke is literally dry-cleaned by electricity . Bushels of soot and cinders are precipitated and removed . An earlier plan to wash the smoke with water was discarded lest a resulting acid eat the roofs off neighboring houses ( page 485 ) . In a room filled with huge gray-painted masses of metal , pipes , and gauges , a handful of men moved quietly about . There was absolutely no dust , heat , or hurry ; yet here at the rate of 27 tons an hour coal was pouring into the furnaces of six boilers five stories high ( see page 488 ) . LOOKING INTO AN INFERNO Out through more than three miles of tunnels , along which a Primo Carnera might walk erect , poured enough steam to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure to the square inch , flowing through some 14 miles of pipes to warm the President and thousands of Government workers , some more than a mile away . Only the buildings on Capitol Hill are not heated from this plant ; they have a smaller one of their own . " This is the biggest plant in the world devoted solely to producing heat , " said the engineer who met me . We walked down the rank of giant boilers . My companion climbed a step at the side of one , pried open a steel door , and over his shoulder I caught a glimpse of Hades . " Do n't try to look at it directly , " he warned . " It would blind you . Get up there and look at it through that blue glass . " I did , while the heat waves almost singed my hair . Fascinated , I gazed into what might have been the interior of a volcano , or the infernal regions , or the fiery furnace of the Old Testament . In a brick-lined room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet high , 60 tons of coal blazed in furious conflagration . Through that red , shimmering interior rushed a tornado generated by high-powered fans blowing air in at the bottom and sucking it out from the top . Wind-swept flames leaped 20 feet high . " Huh , that 's no fire , " said a workman as I stepped down . " You could n't even get coffee hot on that ! We could make it a whole lot hotter if we had to . " One man plus machinery stokes all these huge and hungry boilers , and jets of water under fire-hose pressure take out the ashes . The powerful streams wash them off the bottom of the fire and sluice them into a pit where roaring , grumbling machines grind t 486 THE NATIONAL GEO (  |p486  them up , clinkers and all . About 14 truckloads a day are hauled away to city parks for cinder paths , walks , and fill . On a single cold day , some 600 tons of coal are swallowed up in this miraculous plant and transformed into heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You could step into this tunnel and walk all the way to the Treasury Building , " said the engineer as we entered an electrically lighted passageway with 18-inch conduits and smaller pipes along the sides . I was bound for the Treasury and this was the shortest route , so I set off through the warm tunnel , first shedding my coat . A workman was sent along , " just in case . " As we walked , the temperature ranged all the way from the freezing point near the exits to 140 degrees Fahrenheit in the hot spots . From my guide I learned that the conduits are in 100-foot sections which are about three inches longer when hot than when cold . Clever joints take up the slack and prevent the escape of steam which would wipe out every bit of life in the tunnel . POISON GAS PROTECTS A GIANT SAFE In a court inside the massive gray walls of the stately old Treasury Department , I found another interesting bit of the new Washington . There Uncle Sam has built himself a gigantic concrete , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by mob , master criminal , or even high-explosive air bombs . Six and a half billion dollars in paper money was stored there when I was allowed to enter , the fabulous treasure stacked about in plain paper-wrapped packages like so much writing paper . An ambitious burglar undertaking to tunnel in from below would have to pass through nine and a half feet of concrete and steel , and the slightest tap of pick , drill , or hammer would betray itself to sensitive electric " ears . " An immediate alarm would bring Treasury guards , Washington police , and even a troop of cavalry galloping down from Fort Myer across the river . Steel doors , one on each of the vault 's two floors , weigh 18 tons apiece and are three feet thick . Poison gas has a part in the defense scheme . If a safe cracker somehow passed the 14 iron gates which bar access from outside the building and attacked the vault 's doors with an acetylene torch , the flame would strike a stratum of chemicals and release gas so powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the street has a claim to inclusion in the story of the new Washington . Early in the present administration a swimming pool was installed . Now the President has a new oval office and the entire wing has been remodeled . UNIVERSAL AS GEOGRAPHY ITSELF The new air-conditioned home of the National Geographic Society ( see Color Plate VII ) contains stones from many States and foreign countries . Its front steps are of pink and gray North Carolina granite . Limestone blocks and columns of the facade come from Bedford , Indiana , and three green marble spandrels from the French Alps . In the foyer gleam reddish-brown pillars and pilasters of polished Rojo Alicante marble from Spain . Walls are of lustrous Italian Botticino marble , a rich cream color , above a base of Belgian black marble . Brown Siena and gray Roman travertine form a large eight-pointed star in the floor . Like a bronze medal seven feet in diameter , The Society 's plaque of the Western Hemisphere is set in the center of the star ; it weighs nearly half a ton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reddish Rojo Alicante , Belgian black , and yellow Mankato stone from Minnesota . In other parts of the building are corridor walls of pink marble from Tennessee , and terrazzo floors which contain fragments of gray Tennessee , brown Siena , and Belgian black marbles . Asphalt floors in the Photographic Laboratory and cafeteria kitchen owe their origin to the famous Pitch Lake of Trinidad . Three hundred and fifty asbestos-lined filing cases safeguard The Society 's priceless collection of 208,219 photographs .
