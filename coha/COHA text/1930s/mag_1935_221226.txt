Last month Western Union was sued for $3,600,000 on the ground that under an obscure New Jersey statute of 1877 the company had participated in a lottery by transmitting chain telegrams . Last week in Chelsea , Mass . Western Union was cited for contempt of court because it accepted and transmitted two messages which protested the arrest of an obscure playactor and an allegedly suspicious character , thus offending the dignity of a district judge . <P> Last May one Richard Frey was arrested and charged with using profane language in a Chelsea performance of Clifford Odets ' Waiting for Lefty ( TIME , June 17 ) . Short time later one Martin Halabian was clapped into jail as a suspicious character . Presently the clerk of the Chelsea court received a Western Union telegram from the New Theatre League of Manhattan . It read : " Our National Executive Committee , representing 300 theaters , vigorously protests action against Richard Frey and New Theater players and demands their immediate release . " Not long afterward Judge Samuel R. Cutler of the same court received an unsigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembled at Workers ' Center protest arrest of Halabian on trumped-up charges . Consider this arrest attempt to deny civil liberties to workers . Therefore demand his release at trial . . . " <P> Richard Frey was found not guilty and Martin Halabian got off with a $1 fine , but last week Judge Cutler , in high dudgeon , found Western Union guilty of contempt . Said he : " The company , in its desire to get revenue , has neglected to make rules governing messages of this nature to the courts . It is just as responsible to the libel laws as a newspaper . " Deaf to Western Union 's plea that as a common carrier it is obliged by law to send messages " without discrimination " * and that in any case it had not published the telegrams , he fined the company $500 . <P> *Western Union reserves the right , however , to edit messages which it thinks are profane , obscene or unquestionably libelous.                  @ @ @
