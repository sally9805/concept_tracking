txt Wrongly Located . To the Editor of The New York Timea : Much as Californians are given to boasting of their State and its natural wonders , we have not yet moved the Sequoia gigantea from the mountains into the cities , as suggested by one of your recent Topics of the Times . Under the heading " Christmas Tree for the Nation " you refer to the General Grant tree as being in Fresno , Cal . This tree , second in size only to the General Sherman tree , is in General Grant National Park , seventy-five miles from Fresno , in the High ' Sierra . Several years ago the General Grant tree was designated as " the Nation 's Christmas Tree , " and an ? nually on Christmas Day a program is held at the base of this towering giant of the forest . This year , owing to heavy snowfall in the mountains , only 200 persons were able to reach the tree for the cere ? monies . LOWELL C. PRATT .
