The Three Musketeers ( RKO ) . <P> The routine hazards of adapting a literary classic for the screen are increased in this case by the fact that an earlier adaptation in which Douglas Fairbanks performed in 1921 was a screen classic in its own right . That any subsequent version of the Dumas work would seem tame by comparison was almost inevitable . Consequently , it is to the credit of Author Dumas , Screenwriter Dudley Nichols , Director Rowland V. Lee and a cast of capable sword &; cloak actors that this one is still a handsome , charming , and vivacious costume melodrama which , if something less than a cinema milestone , is still better than average entertainment . <P> Handed the thankless task of replacing Douglas Fairbanks in D'Artagnan 's floppy boots , Actor Walter Abel , in his Hollywood debut , seems a trifle more nervous than a swashbuckler should be . This is due less to his own shortcomings than to the curiosities of the story . Investigating the means whereby the Queen of France ( Rosamond Pinchot ) retrieves a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D'Artagnan as an incompetent young cavalier whose headlong efforts to combat an international intrigue are successful only because the villainess treats him with uncalled for generosity and because Athos ( Paul Lukas ) , Porthos ( Moroni Olsen ) and Aramis ( Onslow Stevens ) interest themselves in drying him behind the ears . Good sequence : the three musketeers overtaking the coach in which Milady de Winter ( Margot Grahame ) has kidnapped D'Artagnan . <P> Way Down East ( Fox ) , like The Three Musketeers ( see above ) , is an effort to redistill for the sophisticated audiences of modern talking pictures the elixirs which their predecessors found so stimulating many years ago . The 1920 production of Lottie Blair Parker 's classic grossed $2,000,000 and the scene in which Lillian Gish floundered toward a happy ending through the ice-cakes probably drew as many tears as anything else David Wark Griffith ever directed . <P> The current version , infinitely more sophisticated , is chiefly noteworthy as an example of directorial tact . Aware that much of the motivation in Way Down East is of the sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry King must frequently have been tempted to burlesque the story rather than risk having audiences discover their own laughs in its sentimental climaxes . Instead , with the aid of a sympathetic script , by Howard Estabrook and William Hurlbut. he gave it a straight-forward treatment , emphasized the backgrounds rather than the plot . The result is that Way Down East has a disarming charm which is almost a satisfactory substitute for the emotional impact of its famed original .
