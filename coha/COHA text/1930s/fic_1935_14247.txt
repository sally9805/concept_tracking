THE lights begin to go down . When they are at half dim a great bell starts tolling the hour of five , muffled and far away  --  doong-doong , as if its iron voice were imprisoned in a tower high above the earth . At the moment of darkness its last surging reverberation fades into the distant sound of a glee-club softly singing the Alma Mater song.Alma mater , alma mater , Hymns of praise be thine today.Here before thy sacred altarGarlands of our love we lay . A moment passes and then the light comes slowly up in the mellow glow of a late autumn afternoon . The scene is a charming nook of the university campus . At the center back is a gray stone figure of an angel , surmounting a granite ball of the world and holding a flambeau aloft in her hand . Standing on the pedestaled base and looking up at the angel 's face is the smaller likeness of a young man whose stone face is represented full of eagerness . Against the stiff folds of his coat he grasps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball of the world is a hollow cupped drinking fountain . The monument is framed by a low green hedge which comes out in a wing on either side with an entrance of a step or two leading down and in at the right and left rear . At the left front the ancient body of an elm tree lifts itself upward with a single golden branch dipping down into the line of sight . Against this tree a long stone bench is set . Opposite and to the right front is another similar bench . This nook is cut into the slope of the hill and on the slightly higher ground at the back the ivy covered wall of a university building stretches like a green back-drop across the scene from right to left . The window to the rostrum of this building is partially open and later WILLIAM CARTER , the Founders ' Day speaker , can be heard whenever in his oratorical pacing he approaches it . When the light comes up a gaunt-faced student of twenty-one or two by the name of HENRY PRATT is sitting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elm tree . He is wrapped up in a well-worn overcoat and an old hat pulled slouchily down over his eyes . A pencil and notebook are held idly in his hand . For a moment he sits looking before him and then begins writing . The glee-club chorus has continued singing softly . Presently a tall dark man in a low-hung clerical coat , white collar and dark tie enters from the left front , stops respectfully when he sees the student , waits a moment and then clears his throat . But the young man makes no response . THE MAN Calling gently over to him . Could you tell me where the exercises are to be held ? p. 3 HENRY PRATT Looking up , yawning and gesturing towards the building , at the rear . In Memorial Hall there . Pointing towards the right rear . The entrance is around that way . THE MAN Thank you . He goes out at right front and PRATT resumes his former position against the tree . The notebook in his hand falls to the ground . He picks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blank page . Two elderly women , alumnae perhaps , wrapped up in autumn clothes , slowly cross the scene at the extreme rear behind the monument . They are chattering in pantomime as they go . They stop , look down at the monument , appraise it in fond remembrance , then set up their pantomime again and go on out at the right rear . PRATT sits thinking . A little wind blows through the scene , and a few golden leaves trickle downwards from the elm tree . He sticks out a long thin hand , catches one of the leaves and stares at it . Then dropping it , he writes slowly in his notebook . After a moment he tears the page out of the book , balls it up , throws it on the ground and starts writing again . UNCLE BENNY , an old workman , comes poking his way in at the right front . He is dressed in overalls , a yarn cap and coat . His gnarled and grizzled face is set with two rheumy eyes that peer about him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carries a sharply pointed stick in his right hand and a tow bag fastened by a strap over his left shoulder . He is crooning to himself the echo of the glee-club music. p. 4 UNCLE BENNY Alma mater , alma mater , Hymns of praise be thine today  --  He bends down , picks up a bit of trash and drops it into his bag . Then turning towards the fountain he carefully scrutinizes the hedge and addresses PRATT out of the side of his mouth . Fine weather for Founders ' Day , ai n't it ? PRATT makes no reply . Hum  --  yes , it is , though a bit chillyish as you might say  --  with the evening coming down and all  --  He spies the wad of paper at PRATT 'S feet , comes over , spears it venomously with his stick , then lifts it to his waiting hand and strips it off into the bag , after which he glares at the young man . How many students do you suppose are at this university , young fellow ? HENRY PRATT With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would guess about a million . UNCLE BENNY No , they ai n't a million . HENRY PRATT Well , ten thousand then . UNCLE BENNY Well  --  and if all these ten thousand  --  hum  --  went about dropping paper on the ground the way you do  --  hum  --  how much paper do you think that would be ? PRATT shrugs his shoulders , making no reply . The old man turns and waddles over to the fountain , pushes the button and bends down for a drink . Then he lays his stick down , pulls out a cloth from his pocket , and begins cleaning the fountain . A seedy middle-aged man and his dowdy wife with a little stringy girl enter slowly at the left front. p. 5 THE MAN Looking over towards the angel and speaking in a reverent voice . The same as fourteen years ago when I left here . GIRL Who , Daddy ? THE MAN Gently . Our alma mater . GIRL What 's she doing ? THE MAN Just standing there , honey . Pointing the way  --  pointing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GIRL Is that her boy ? THE MAN Yes , her boy . Me  --  and thousands of others like me and she is our mother . GIRL I thought Grandma was your mother . THE MAN Yes , yes . Slowly as if thinking far-away thoughts . But this was my mother too . Aye , in a way she was . Murmuring . Alma mater , alma mater . Written there in Latin , see the words ?  --  " From darkness into light . " WOMAN Come on . The man sighs almost audibly and then taking the girl by the hand leads the way out at the right front , the woman walking stiffly behind them. p. 6 GIRL As they go . Does she stand there in the night too , and the boy ? THE MAN As they disappear . Night and day , honey , all the time they stand there . Forever . The workman holds his cloth in his hand and gazes after them a moment . UNCLE BENNY Staring at the fountain and then turning back towards PRATT who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean there ? " From darkness into light . " Hum  --  why did n't they put it in writing you could read ? HENRY PRATT Irritably . What ? UNCLE BENNY Them words on the monument . I 've been cleaning ' em for twenty years and never knowed what they said . HENRY PRATT They wanted a dead language . UNCLE BENNY Who ? HENRY PRATT The professors . UNCLE BENNY Somewhat nonplussed but respectful . Yes , yes  --  well then that ought to be right  --  if the professors say so . Musingly as he pulls out an old pipe and lights it . Ah , learning  --  Puff-puff.  --  is a wunnerful thing  --  Puff-puff . Now with an old man 's show of talkativeness . Yes , sir . Powerful . Staring at PRATT . Are you a student ? p. 7 HENRY PRATT Curtly . Yes . UNCLE BENNY What 's your subject ? Making some show of knowledge himself as PRATT is silent.  --  Soshiology , economics , botany , philosophy ? HENRY PRATT Latin . Same as that writing there . UNCLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must take a headful of sense to study that stuff . A heavy-set shabbily dressed middle-aged man comes into the scene at the right front . He hurries on across towards the left . UNCLE BENNY tips his cap politely . Good morning  --  Correcting himself hastily.  --  good evening , Dr. Coleman . But DR . COLEMAN 'S mind is evidently on some weighty matter for he looks neither to the right nor to the left as he goes on out . UNCLE BENNY somewhat shamefacedly pulls the brim of his cap down and gestures with his pipe in the direction of the departing DR . COLEMAN . Now speaking of sense  --  there goes a brainy professor , beyond a doubt . HENRY PRATT Looking up an instant . Dr. Coleman ? UNCLE BENNY Yes , Dr. Coleman . Hear me speak to him ? Hah , hah , his mind 's on deep things , mighty things . He did n't even see me . Hear tell the president wants him to come to Washington to help relieve the Indians . I hope he do n't go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRATT . You know they say he 's one of the greatest sosh  --  soshiologists in the world . Writes books  --  big books . I had one of ' em in my hand once , must have weighed five pounds . Words , millions of ' em it seemed to my soul . Deep stuff . I got my daughter to read some of it to me . But wunnerful it was . And not for ignorant folks . Ah , smart and great he is  --  and figures ! They says he 's got figures piled up in his office about everything there is , rows on rows of ' em and machines there to add ' em up quicker'n you can wink your eye . Chuckling . He 's got figures on me too . Ah  --  sense , sense . What a man ! p. 8 HENRY PRATT Parenthetically . Figures on you ? UNCLE BENNY Taking a long pull from his pipe . Yes , me and my wife . Last year he come out there where we live . Come right into our humble home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of questions and he put ' em down in a notebook like that one you got there except nicer , and bound in leather . And he asked the children things , what time they went to bed , what we all done on Sunday , how many newspapers we subscribe to and how many books we read in a year . And some of the things he asked my wife got kind of personal . You know what I mean  --  scientific . And my wife was ashamed to answer . I said , Why , wife , I says , Dr. Coleman knows what he 's doing . It 's all in the cause of sosh  --  soshiology . Soshiology is the greatest thing in the world , I said . That 's right , said Dr. Coleman , it is . Through it we 're going to change the face of the world , make people happier , healthier and better we will , and we need the facts . So I said , Go ahead and answer them questions , I says to my wife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then I 'm in its hands . Yes , in its hands for better or for worse . For better , says Dr. Coleman , quicklike . And I agrees . But my wife was ashamed just the same . HENRY PRATT With a tiny barking laugh . Hah-hah-hah . The wind stirs through the scene again . A few more leaves fall and PRATT looks mournfully out at them , the old man following his gaze as he mutters . Cadere vitam  --  flores mortis. p. 9 UNCLE BENNY All over the campus the leaves are falling and the willow oaks are shedding too . Uhm  --  cold weather coming on . HENRY PRATT Laconically . So I 've heard-winter follows fall . UNCLE BENNY But I wo n't mind . They 're gon na give me a job indoors where it 's warm . After thirty years they are . Sadly . Time flies . HENRY PRATT Tempus fugit . UNCLE BENNY After a moment , murmuring . The years come and go , the seasons change , and God keeps us all in the hollow of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HENRY PRATT Irritably again . All right , have it your way . God or no God . He tears another sheet of paper out of his notebook . The old workman watches him like a hawk . As he balls it up and starts to throw it down the old man springs up . UNCLE BENNY No you do n't . He goes over to him , holds open the mouth of his sack and PRATT drops the paper disgustedly in . Then he turns back to the rear of the scene and begins working at the fountain again . A down-and-out middle-aged man dressed in overalls and an old coat and cap comes in at the left front . He stops and looks over at PRATT. p. 10 THE DOWN-AND-OUT Have n't got the price of a cup of coffee , have you , Buddy ? HENRY PRATT No , nor for a drink of liquor either , Buddy . I 'm broke . THE DOWN-AND-OUT Bitterly . Okay . UNCLE BENNY Calling out . Begging ai n't allowed around here  --  especially not today . THE DOWN-AND-OUT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loan . UNCLE BENNY Well , we ca n't loan you nothing . The tramp drifts on out at the right front . It 's getting so a lot of them factory workers come up here a-begging . You have to watch ' em . They 're rough customers . HENRY PRATT Yeh , and there 's something to make ' em rough down in Mr. Carter 's mills . Three cheer leaders carrying huge megaphones come hurrying in from the right front . They are bareheaded , dressed in white turtle-neck sweaters , white flannel trousers , and white shoes . The middle one wears on the front of his sweater an intricate monogram made up of the letters C.I.C. When they reach the left front the middle one holds up his hand and suddenly stops . They all set their megaphones down on the ground and at a gesture from him huddle close together. p. 11 CHEER LEADER And then as Mr. Carter enters the campus gates , Billy Parker says we 're to let her whiz  --  Whee-oo  --  boom ! FIRST ASSISTANT Okay , we catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his two clenched fists out in front of him . All right , let 's go . He swings his fists from left to right in time with the count , and the other two do likewise . THE THREE One two , one two , one two  --  whee  --  roo  --  bam ! And now their fists are shot backwards and forwards in front of them in time to their high-voiced spelling . B-I-L-L-Y C-A-R-T-E-R . Billy Carter , rah ! rah ! rah ! CHEER LEADER Okay , Dave , you got it that time . They pick up their megaphones and hurry away to the left . UNCLE BENNY looks after them with a grin on his face . UNCLE BENNY I guess Mr. Carter 's the greatest man ever turned out here , from this university , ai n't he ? HENRY PRATT Snarling . I du n no . UNCLE BENNY He 's got factories up in the north and in the south . The papers say he 's one of the richest men in America . PRATT makes no answer . They say all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars . PRATT makes no answer , still being busy with his notebook . And they say he 's going to put up a great memorial tower to his wife  --  Gesturing.  --  over there somewhere with bells from ' crost the water thet 'll play tunes like a piano . p. 12 HENRY PRATT Intoning . So doth these kings of industry seek to perpetuate their name . Muttering . Timeo danaos et dona ferentes . That 's Latin  --  means I hate his guts . The old workman stares at him perplexed . Along the path that crosses the foreground a young girl enters with an armful of flowers . A voice is heard calling behind her off at the right  --  " Hy-ee ! " She stops and looks back . Another girl comes tripping in . She also has an armful of flowers . SECOND GIRL Which way does the procession come ? FIRST GIRL Through the west entrance , Billy Parker says . We 're all to meet him there . SECOND GIRL As they go out at the left . Gee , I 'm excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workman watches them out and then resumes his work . A FRESHMAN about seventeen years old , his cap set up like the crest of a king bird , comes down into the scene from the right rear . He is absorbed in a university catalogue which he carries held closely in front of his eyes . FRESHMAN In a long sing-song voice as if memorizing something . In obedience to the will of the founder of this university , the principle was set forth that all citizens of this commonwealth should have an opportunity at useful education . A clause of section forty-one declares that all useful and proper learning shall be duly encouraged and promoted at this institution . The university is organized into a college of liberal arts and ten schools  --  a school of applied science , a school of law , a school of medicine , a school of engineering , and  --  The FRESHMAN passes on up the steps and out at the left rear reading as he goes. p. 13 UNCLE BENNY With a croaking laugh , as he works . A fellow 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's memorizing the catalogue , by ding . Musingly . Hum  --  hum , I remember one time long ago they tied a pig to the bell rope . Such a ringing ! Everybody thought the world was afire  --  or something . Cramming the cloth into his pocket , he takes his stick in hand and pokes his way out at the left front , his eyes searching the ground in front of him . For a moment PRATT continues working away in his notebook . BILLY PARKER comes in from the right front . He is a well-built young man about twenty years old , of a studious type , well-dressed , quiet and gentle-mannered . HENRY PRATT Looking up and then speaking eagerly . Hello , Billy , I 've been waiting for you . Got a minute ? BILLY PARKER Looking off towards the left . Yes , I guess so  --  just a minute . He moves towards PRATT , and then stops . HENRY PRATT I 've got a poem here  --  it 's going to be good  --  " The Dying Mill-hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying mill-hand lay . PARKER takes the proffered notebook and scans the page for a moment . PRATT watches his face anxiously. p. 14 BILLY PARKER Without enthusiasm . It seems pretty good , Henry . HENRY PRATT Warmly . Well , you would know , Billy , if anybody did . Have you got room for it in the next issue of the magazine ? BILLY PARKER Hesitating . Maybe , but you better speak to Rachel about it . She 's making up the next issue . He hands the notebook back to PRATT . HENRY PRATT Irritably . Then there wo n't be room for it . She do n't like me . BILLY PARKER Sorry , I 've got to run , Henry . Almost time for the exercises . HENRY PRATT Now bitterly . That 's right  --  go ahead up there and welcome your millionaire Carter and tell him we all love him . BILLY PARKER With a little show of feeling , but patiently . As President of the student body I have certain duties to perform , Henry . HENRY PRATT Sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William and yours is William too  --  is that right ? BILLY PARKER Quietly . Yes , I was named for him . He and Father were classmates  --  PRATT gives a tiny barking laugh again and then suddenly stops. p. 15 HENRY PRATT As PARKER starts away . Never mind , we wo n't quarrel about it . By the way , Billy , I never did thank you for getting me out of that little jailhouse scrape . BILLY PARKER Glad to do it , Henry . HENRY PRATT And say , you  --  er  --  do n't happen to have a little loose change , do you ? BILLY PARKER I 've just got seven dollars till my check comes . HENRY PRATT Pecunia causa vivendi , as the Latin so aptly puts it . I hate to ask you , but I need a couple of bucks bad . I 'm broke as a convict . BILLY PARKER Giving him the money . Glad to help you , Henry  --  in spite of your backbiting . HENRY PRATT Remember , I 'm keeping it on the books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in from the left . He is about twenty years old , dark haired , stocky , energetic of form , with a slightly pugnacious face , quick inquisitive eyes and full lips . Here we have the future pragmatic man of science and fact . JAMES MITCHELL Gleefully . That 's the best news I 've heard in a month . Johnny Meacham 's out of the infirmary . He 's going to play in the Thanksgiving game . PRATT turns away with a slight gesture of scorn and sits staring before him. p. 16 BILLY PARKER With some show of interest . Hello , Mitch  --  Well , we ought to win then . JAMES MITCHELL Right . With a cold touch in his voice . Hello , Pratt . PRATT makes no reply but pulls his hat down over his eyes and leans back against the tree . A noise of droning voices is heard off at the left . MITCHELL turns and calls . JAMES MITCHELL Bring in the neophytes . Two FRESHMEN come in side by side from the left front . They carry university catalogues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark figures dressed in monk 's robes and hoods , one on either side and carrying paddles in their hands . They turn in and face MITCHELL who lifts his hands and speaks . Let the scripture readings begin . FRESHMAN Intoning . Through the co-operation of all concerned religious influences of an unusually effective character surround the student 's university life . THE TWO DARK FIGURES Raising their paddles and singing in hoarse and empty voices . Ecce quam bonum quamque jucundum habitare fratres in unum . They bring their paddles down with a crack against the FRESHMEN 'S backsides , the while their voices rise in a high wild call . Allah is almighty ! The two FRESHMEN flinch and then straighten up again and face towards the rear p. 17 JAMES MITCHELL As he steps to the end of the line at the right . And the body of its purpose ? He gestures to PARKER who hesitates and with a diffident smile goes over to the left end of the line . SECOND FRESHMAN Intoning quaveringly . The university endeavors to make young men manly and self-reliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TWO DARK FIGURES With MITCHELL and PARKER joining in , the latter without much enthusiasm . Ecce quam bonum quamque jucundum habitare fratres in unum . Once more the paddles crack down against the FRESHMEN and the wild cry of " Allah is almighty ! " goes up . RACHEL JARVIS , a pretty dark-haired girl of nineteen or twenty , comes in from the left front . She wears tortoise-shell glasses which give her a studious prim look somewhat in contrast to her feminine charm of face and figure . She carries a brief case under her arm . PARKER nods brightly to her . BILLY PARKER Hello , Rachel . RACHEL JARVIS Quietly . Hello , Billy . The FRESHMEN look out at RACHEL with a fleeting pleading in their eyes. p. 18 FRESHMAN Reading . The student council shall at their discretion admonish , suspend or dismiss a student for neglect of duty , drunkenness , cheating , gambling , or participation in hazing . THE TWO DARK FIGURES With MITCHELL joining . Ecce quam bonum quamque jucundum habitare fratres in unum . Again the paddles come down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! RACHEL JARVIS Sharply to MITCHELL . Are n't you fellows ashamed  --  beating the poor freshmen like that ? You 'll put an inferiority complex in their minds . JAMES MITCHELL Not in their minds , child , but further down . RACHEL JARVIS It 's all the same with freshmen . FRESHMAN It do n't hurt , lady , we 've got sheet rock in our britches . THE TWO DARK FIGURES Sheet rock ? Both paddles are now brought down with a bang . The two neophytes spring straight into the air with a howl , and then stand shuddering in their tracks . JAMES MITCHELL Now we 'll march down to welcome Mr. Carter and the governor . In the hard voice of a drill master . Hep-hep-hep , you crumbs ! The FRESHMEN turn to the right and move off at the left front , accompanied by THE TWO DARK FIGURES who hold their paddles threateningly over them . MITCHELL follows behind. p. 19 BILLY PARKER Gee , it 's good to see you , Rachel . RACHEL JARVIS Good to see you , Billy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight , you guess ? RACHEL JARVIS I 've got to work in the laboratory tonight . Anyway , I 've been through it already and picked out the best . BILLY PARKER Catching PRATT 'S appealing look . Still , I wish you 'd have a look at something Henry 's writing . In the distance at the right rear the university band begins softly playing " The Washington and Lee Swing . " PARKER looks off . Gee , I 've got to run . Looking at RACHEL . I wo n't be long , Rachel . He gives a quick half-embarrassed little wave at her and hurries off at the left . RACHEL stands looking thoughtfully at the ground . Then she sits down on the stone seat at the right , stretches her trim feet and ankles out before her and looks at them admiringly . HENRY PRATT Eyeing her . Feet  --  ankles  --  legs  --  they look all right  --  Satirically . All I can see . RACHEL JARVIS Caustically . Thank you . p. 20 HENRY PRATT But they do n't do anybody any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JARVIS They do me some good . I walk on ' em . Staring at him . You have a nice way of approaching an editor to get a piece published . HENRY PRATT I speak my mind always . And to think that Billy  --  RACHEL JARVIS All right , what about this new poem ? HENRY PRATT After pacing up and down a moment . I 've been sitting here gathering inspiration from the occasion . Mockingly reciting . At this hour one hundred and ten years ago the corner-stone of this great institution was laid . Opening his notebook and reading . Now laid to earth her broken body lies , And lost beyond the sun the truths she taught ; Her shining words are blown about the skiesAnd ruined in glory are the deeds she wrought . RACHEL JARVIS Sounds gloomy enough . What 's the title ? HENRY PRATT " Alma Mater . " RACHEL JARVIS Coldly . I 'm not interested in attacks on the university . p. 21 HENRY PRATT You need n't get het up . I was just quoting . That ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dying Mill-Hand . " He hands her the open notebook . She reads a moment and then looks up at him . RACHEL JARVIS And that 's worse . HENRY PRATT It 's got some mighty straight-smashing facts about labor in it , and the style 's got feeling , as they say in Freshman English . RACHEL JARVIS Yeh , and you had feeling in that article Billy let you publish two months ago . Why I do n't know . Mr. Carter did n't like it and he wrote Father a letter about it . She turns a leaf in the notebook . HENRY PRATT Throwing up his hands . All right . All right . And I reckon you wo n't publish it . RACHEL JARVIS No , I wo n't . Nor this other one either . Reading . She called us sons  --  in error even thatFor darkly now the crooked vision standsRinged round these witless eyes , these faces flat , These traffickers with outstretched fawning hands . HENRY PRATT You know how the professors , the deans , and the president  --  your father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds and endowments  --  the way they 're doing yonder millionaire now . That 's what Billy means there . p. 22 RACHEL JARVIS Do n't tell me Billy Parker wrote that poem . HENRY PRATT Belligerently . Well , he did , but he did n't mean it to get out . I copied it before he burnt it up . RACHEL JARVIS Angrily . You 're poisoning his mind  --  I want you to know  --  you and your radical ideas are a bad influence . HENRY PRATT Yeh , and talk about poison  --  you and your psychology are ruining his heart  --  or something . RACHEL JARVIS Obviously making an effort and then breaking into a sudden sunshiny smile . Now look , you 're getting angry . Frustration , lack of personal adequacy . Stop it . HENRY PRATT Raging . Go to  --  He rises , pulls his overcoat up about him , and lights a cigarette . The sounds of the brass-band and youthful voices singing are heard nearer at hand off to the left . PRATT gestures in that direction with a salaam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great capitalist , the sweat king of millions . Let him come , I wo n't welcome him . There 's still one stalwart soul in Sodom . He stamps angrily off at the right front . RACHEL stares thoughtfully before her . The band and the singing are now filling the air with the tune of " When Johnny Comes Marching Home . " Cavorting into the scene at the left front comes the plumed prancing figure of the bandmaster , cutting didoes like a spirited horse . He hops up on the bench at the left , raises his baton , blows the whistle clenched between his teeth for the band to stop , which it does just off stage . Then he turns and faces towards the front , continuing the up and down piston work of his directing arm . The band plays gaily off stage , and the cheering and singing grow louder at the left , intermingled with the cries of " Carter  --  Carter  --  Carter  --  rah  --  rah  --  team  --  team ! " The three cheer leaders rush in from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky the way Gabriel might on the day he blows his horn they send forth a blast of high unintelligible syllables. p. 23 CHEER LEADERS Wow  --  roo  --  roo  --  er  --  er  --  ah  --  boom ! Setting the megaphones down , they lead the cheering . B-I-L-L-Y C-A-R-T-E-R  --  rah  --  rah  --  rah . Picking up their megaphones they begin singing through them in time with the approaching crowd . When Billy comes marching home again , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hurrah , hurrah ! We 'll give him a hearty good welcome then , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hurrah , hurrah ! The girls will cheer , the boys will shout , The whole damn college will turn out , And we 'll all feel gayWhen Billy comes marching home . WILLIAM CARTER , the Napoleon of finance , enters from the left front . He is a short squat bull of a man , of fifty or more , with clean-shaven muscled face , dressed in a gaudy checked suit and flowing tie and carrying a derby hat held before him as he receives the plaudits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walks the GOVERNOR in top silk hat and dark suit , and on the other side is PRESIDENT JARVIS , a tall elderly dignified man with gray hair . Slightly behind them are DEAN WILLIAMS and BILLY PARKER , and other faculty members dressed in caps and gowns . Several young co-eds are running and gamboling about CARTER as the procession passes on , pelting him with flowers and cheering him . CARTER 'S face is wreathed in smiles and so are the faces of the others behind him , with the exception of BILLY PARKER 'S . He is looking straight ahead of him with serious face . He glances over at RACHEL who is standing up applauding and gives her a half-awkward wave of his hand , which she does n't seem to notice . The procession passes on , singing loudly , and then fading in the distance. p. 24 PROCESSION As the campus bell begins to ring wildly . The campus bell will peal with joy , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hurrah , hurrah ! To welcome home her darling boy , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hurrah , hurrah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will strew the way , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And we 'll all feel gayWhen Billy comes marching home . The procession moves out at the right front , the girls throwing their flowers , the assembled people following , and the THREE CHEER LEADERS going last , blowing through their megaphones their loud and cacophonous syllables . And now the band leader begins to cut up again on the bench , acting like one set upon by running fits . Finally he gets his direction right and cavorts out at the left front the way he came , blowing his whistle wildly . The off-stage band evidently follows , softening its music into final silence . RACHEL is left alone in the scene . She stands as if in indecision , starts to go along after the marchers , then turns and moves away towards the left . Spying PRATT 'S notebook she picks it up , turns the pages and sits down reading it again . A moment passes and JOHNNY MEACHAM , the football player , comes in at the right . He is half looking behind him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the homo natural with none too high a forehead and plastered-down hair . He is about twenty-five years old , and wrapped up in a heavy white sweater which is set with the blue letters of the college monogram  --  C.I.C. His iron jaw shows the bruises and marks of former battles , he limps slightly and walks with the aid of a rough walking stick. p. 25 RACHEL JARVIS Looking up at the crunch of his shoe on the gravel . How 's the knee , Johnny ? JOHNNY MEACHAM Right now I feel like an eighty-yard punt . Doc says I got to keep walking around . Keep walking around , he says  --  looking at the birds  --  anything . Look at the girls , even . He laughs and feels his plastered hair caressingly . Going to the big game ? RACHEL JARVIS You bet . JOHNNY MEACHAM Well , you 're gon na see something . Stretching his great arms and clenching his sledge-hammer fists . Gees , I been resting up for a week . Half-crouching and letting out a guttural growl . Let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed him to the birds . With a snatching motion he tears the air into shreds and flings the pieces off in a sowing motion . For a moment he stands basking in the benediction of his own unconquerable power , then as he looks off at the left front , his jaw drops down like a dead man 's . A gasp breaks from him . Lord a-mercy , there 's that man . Hide me  --  er  --  hide me  --  I got to get away quick . He looks helplessly about him , then hurries quickly over to the fountain and bends down with his back to the front in long drinking . DR . LAWRENCE , a little dried-up elderly man with a penerating cold blue eye , comes stepping in . He is in a hurry and carries an academic robe on his arm , his tasseled cap in his hand . He spies MEACHAM and stops. p. 26 DR . LAWRENCE In a high piping voice . Mr. Meacham . MEACHAM still bends over the fountain . Your anatomy is distinctive , I know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his forehead with his handkerchief . JOHNNY MEACHAM Stuttering . Eve  --  evening , Dr. Lawrence . DR . LAWRENCE I notice you have escaped from the infirmary . JOHNNY MEACHAM The doctor said I could get out , sir . DR . LAWRENCE He did n't by chance say you could come over to my office and see me about that Shakespeare , did he ? JOHNNY MEACHAM No , sir . DR . LAWRENCE Well , you better  --  tomorrow morning at ten o'clock . You 're in danger of flunking that course , Mr. Meacham , did you know that ? JOHNNY MEACHAM I 'm afraid so , sir . DR . LAWRENCE You 're teetering on the brink , Mr. Meacham , teetering on the brink . Barking out . Who was Coriolanus ? JOHNNY MEACHAM I  --  I  --  DR . LAWRENCE holds his cold eyes upon him . What did you say his name was ? p. 27 DR . LAWRENCE Who was Ajax ? JOHNNY MEACHAM Is it the same man ? DR . LAWRENCE Flinging up his hands . Hah  --  hah  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOHNNY MEACHAM Moaning . He scares me to death  --  that little man does . I have cold sweats at night . I wake up dreaming about him , feeling him boring after my brains with a steel gimlet . Shuddering . Ooh  --  I want this year to hurry and end  --  I want it to end quick . Gazing dolefully about him . I was gon na go down to the lake and watch the swans eat crumbs . Now I got ta  --  I got ta  --  RACHEL JARVIS With a sudden gay laugh . Go on , Johnny . JOHNNY MEACHAM Piteously . Yeh , yeh . He hurries limpfully away at the left rear . RACHEL resumes her study of the notebook . Two MEDICAL STUDENTS come in at the right rear and stop by the drinking fountain . One of them carries a skull in his hand and the other a tibia bone . FIRST MEDICAL STUDENT As the other bends down drinking . Sometimes I wonder why in the hell I ever started this medical course . No time for anything else  --  not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight dip of his head sideways . I could spend an hour or two right there . p. 28 SECOND MEDICAL STUDENT Softly , as the first one drinks . I do n't have to look at a woman to wonder why I took it . Shuddering . Lord , I ca n't get used to the look of a corpse 's eye . FIRST MEDICAL STUDENT You better get used to it in a hurry . We got another bunch of stiffs coming over from the electric chair tomorrow . SECOND MEDICAL STUDENT God , wo n't they ever stop that ?  --  all this electrocuting people  --  hanging  --  gassing ' em  --  whatever it is . FIRST MEDICAL STUDENT What would we practice our knives on if they did ? And how'n hell can we serve humanity if we do n't practice our knives ? Tell me that , Aesc'lapius . A great organ begins to play the opening of the Alma Mater song in the building at the rear . Come on , religion 's beginning to blow . They start out at the left , giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet the old workman coming in . He shies around the skull as they pass out . UNCLE BENNY Uhm  --  I wish they would n't carry people 's heads around the way they do . He comes on over into the scene . The organ in the building at the rear suddenly stops . A sound of great handclapping is heard , and then the organ begins again , thundering and tremendous , as if in the pause it had been gathering its breath for a blast . A multitude of lusty young men 's and women 's voices accompany it in half-distinguishable words. p. 29 VOICES Alma mater , alma mater , Hymns of praise be thine today , Here before thy sacred altarGarlands of our love we lay . &nbsp;  --  Then it 's hail , ever hail , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sing triumphant , loudly cheer  --  The old workman stands in the middle of the scene listening and humming with the music . It stops and now through the windows of the building comes the faint and lowly mumble of a man 's reverent voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessing usually found necessary on such occasions . We can imagine what he is saying though his words are indistinct to us . The old workman carries on his low singing to himself , though with an eye out for its effect on RACHEL . UNCLE BENNY Heart and soul we are thine , Alma mater , mother dear . A little wind blows through the scene again , and a few more stricken leaves trickle down from the elm tree to the ground . The old man stares at them and goes on singing in his low flat voice . Alma mater , alma mater , See the light of heaven falls  --  RACHEL JARVIS As his voice dies out . You ought to be in there helping them sing , Uncle Benny . She smiles over at him and looks towards the building at the rear . The notebook falls unnoticed to the ground. p. 30 UNCLE BENNY You would n't think I 'd know them university songs , now would you ? But I do  --  the " Alma Mater " song and " Hail to the Shining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Glory of Her Days "  --  Staring over at the monument and mumbling . From darkness into light  --  RACHEL JARVIS Whew , and you can read Latin , too . She busies herself with her brief case , taking out a pad and making notations . The old man stares at her a moment . UNCLE BENNY As the sound of applause is heard in the building at the rear . B'lieve I 'll go up nearer where I can hear Mr. Carter . He 's most as good a speaker as your father , Miss Rachel . RACHEL JARVIS Still indirectly . Yes . UNCLE BENNY Then he 's going some . For when President Jarvis is speaking with his hand held up ready to bring it down  --  tell you , the cold shivers run all over my back , and I feel equal to anything . He spies the notebook on the ground , spears it with his stick , strips it into his bag and then moves out and up the low steps at the left rear . Sometime later he can be seen taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back . BILLY PARKER comes walking in from the right front. p. 31 RACHEL JARVIS Looking up . Why , Billy , are n't you supposed to be up on the rostrum with all the great folks ? BILLY PARKER Apologetically . I thought I 'd play hookey this time . The place is jammed full of notables . They wo n't miss me . Besides  --  RACHEL JARVIS But the head of the student body is notable too , or should be . BILLY PARKER So is the daughter of the president . RACHEL JARVIS I 've excused myself today . My experiment wo n't wait for anybody . Looking off . I 've got to go back to the laboratory in a minute . But you  --  you should have stayed in there . BILLY PARKER I guess I got stage fright all of a sudden . Anyway I did n't feel like facing it today . RACHEL JARVIS Facing what ? BILLY PARKER Oh , the eyes of thousands . But I escorted Mr. Carter to the door . Looking at her warmly . It 's good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychology lab lately  --  Well , you keep mighty close . The VOICE of the speaker which has begun in distant indistinguishable syllables in the building at the rear now comes nearer the open window as WILLIAM CARTER paces the platform. p. 32 VOICE Authoritative , rotund and slightly oratorical . Into these doors you have come with youth 's proud vigor and expectancy in your eyes . Your alma mater is proud of you and centers her hope upon you , and as she never fails you , her sons and daughters , be it your sacred obligation never to fail her , whatever the cost of service , whatever the task required . The VOICE dies away as the speaker retires down the platform . UNCLE BENNY appears taking up his stand by the window , cocking his head and listening with intense eagerness . RACHEL JARVIS Resuming the dialogue . And you keep mighty close somewhere too . You shut yourself away in your room , associate with that radical Pratt . You 're getting yourself inhibited  --  and you 're unhappy  --  that 's what you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BILLY PARKER Murmuring . Well , I 'm doing a lot of studying this year . Looking over at her . Now that you do n't let me see you any more . RACHEL JARVIS Raising her hand . No , not that intimate tone . I wo n't allow it . You 've promised to be  --  er  --  p. 33 BILLY PARKER Sharply . Yeh , scientific . RACHEL JARVIS But seriously , Billy , I 'm concerned about you . In a hurried sort of childish recitation as PARKER 'S face shows his pleasure . Only as a friend though , or even as an elder sister might be maybe . BILLY PARKER With a groan . Great guns ! RACHEL JARVIS Somehow  --  I really do feel much older than you . BILLY PARKER Golly , you 're two years younger . RACHEL JARVIS Anyway , I feel that I have passed beyond these  --  well , childish things that bother you , that inhibit you . BILLY PARKER What childish things ? RACHEL JARVIS The things you talked about so much the last few times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the meaning of the world , what truth is  --  vague far-off subjects . PARKER gazes at her . The VOICE at the rear is now heard clearly as the speaker approaches the window . VOICE The responsibility of the future is upon you  --  a future filled with mighty questions for your deciding . And here in these sacred halls you are being fitted for these stupendous tasks . And you must remember that what you learn here , what you make up your minds to be here , the way you disport yourselves during these years of training will determine how you serve not only your alma mater and yourself  --  but the world . The unalterable command is to go forward in the cause of education and progress . The VOICE waits and a burst of applause follows , in which UNCLE BENNY is seen joining whole-heartedly . The speaker moves away from the window. p. 34 BILLY PARKER With a forced smile at RACHEL . Mr. Carter 's not inhibited all right . And he seems to know what truth is . RACHEL JARVIS And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who does things , tremendous things  --  that  --  I do n't guess he ever sat around moaning and groaning when he was a student here . No , he pushed on , stood out , was a leader . Of course , you 've been prominent too , Billy , but more because of your family and because people like you and not because of what you do . BILLY PARKER You seem to talk a lot about action and doing things lately since you became a scientist and put on spectacles . RACHEL JARVIS In her recitative manner . Because I 've learned that that is the normal nature of men . Yes , dramatic action , that 's what I mean , standing in a crisis and taking charge . Mr. Carter does that . And now wo n't you tell me why you wrote that poem complaining about the university ? BILLY PARKER Quickly . What poem ? RACHEL JARVIS Something about " ruined " and " lost . " Pratt had it in his notebook . BILLY PARKER Uhm  --  well , I guess he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see it . p. 35 RACHEL JARVIS Yes , he thought it was wonderful enough to keep . That ought to prove how bad it is . All foggy  --  indefinite  --  and sick . Why did you write it ? BILLY PARKER After a moment . If you want to know the truth , I was sore . RACHEL JARVIS What were you sore about ? BILLY PARKER Maybe I was more bothered than sore . RACHEL JARVIS Why ? BILLY PARKER The other day in Chapel  --  when your father announced about the new bell tower and went on to praise Mr. Carter for his great philanthropy  --  well , I kept thinking about the conditions down in Mr. Carter 's mill villages . Suddenly I wanted to stand up and say out loud all those things I felt . Later I tried to write them down . RACHEL JARVIS You mean you had an impulse ? BILLY PARKER For the moment I did . RACHEL JARVIS Staring off . Whew , would n't that have been a sensation ! Why did n't you give free rein to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the impulse  --  In the uninhibited nature , the impulse is most important . Of course I 'm not thinking of what you would have said . That would have been nonsense like the poem . But the main thing would be that you did something  --  you acted . p. 36 BILLY PARKER Now shaking his head . Sometimes I think  --  Gesturing towards the rear  --  But we 're still on the subject of truth  --  listen . The VOICE from the rear comes out strongly again . VOICE Mark ye , take counsel . I repeat , this is the training ground for the battlefield of life . Here are the tools , here are the teachers , men who have devoted their careers to the searching out and finding of truth and her glories . The DOWN-AND-OUT comes drifting in at the right rear . He stops and sinks down on the steps and bends his head into his hands , staring at the ground . The VOICE has continued.  --  Here are the laboratories , the buildings  --  all established for you and for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will prevail . And as has been said by the wisest of men  --  The VOICE dies down again to a mumble . BILLY PARKER Softly as if to himself . That sounds so much like Uncle John in the cathedral  --  As if quoting.  --  Knock and it shall be opened unto you , seek and ye shall find . RACHEL JARVIS The modern view puts it better  --  Act and ye shall find . PARKER bows his head . The great bell begins to toll the half-hour . RACHEL looks at her watch . My goodness , I 've got to get back to the laboratory . She springs up. p. 37 BILLY PARKER With sudden roughness . Yes , the subject is truth and you 're worrying about your rats . RACHEL JARVIS Come down and see Dr. Winford , Billy . You better . He could help you . BILLY PARKER I 'm not interested in Dr. Winford I keep telling you  --  Now looking up at her.  --  not when I see what he is doing to you . RACHEL JARVIS A bit warmly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every day I learn something more new and wonderful . Why , he 's one of the world 's greatest psychologists , Billy . BILLY PARKER Yeh , and he 's ruining you with his greatness or whatever you call it . RACHEL JARVIS Hotly . You ought to be ashamed to talk like that . BILLY PARKER Shaking his head . All right  --  I do n't know how to talk to you any more . Helplessly . You 're not the old Rachel  --  not the Rachel I love . Something has got between us  --  something wraps you around and away from me . Sometimes I wish I could shake you  --  wake you out of this spell  --  break through and reach you . Throwing out his hands . But I can't. p. 38 RACHEL JARVIS With a touch of anger . No you ca n't  --  not when you talk like that . Stop it , I tell you , stop all this worrying and tangling yourself in a maze of confusion . I  --  I  --  Oh , I do n't know what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more . I  --  good-bye , Billy . She turns and hurries away at the right front . PARKER stares after her and then sits down on the bench at the left . PRATT enters at the left rear . HENRY PRATT Looking about the scene as he comes on towards the front . I 'm hunting for my notebook . BILLY PARKER Lifting his hand . S-sh . HENRY PRATT Catching sight of UNCLE BENNY at the back . Guess the old man got it . Well , no matter . He sits down on the bench at the right . The speaker 's voice comes in again now with heightened fervor . VOICE Here is food for the spirit , for the upbuilding of character , for the rounding out of disciplined bodies and souls . And when you go forth you will be trained men and women ready to share in the great future ahead  --  a future golden with promises , lighted like the dawn of a new day . THE DOWN-AND-OUT begins to laugh noiselessly. p. 39 HENRY PRATT Ai n't it wonderful ? Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't he tell ' em the truth in there ? Tell ' em life is hard , hard as iron , tough , and it takes a tough guy to live it ? THE DOWN-AND-OUT You said it , Buddy . Tough , that 's right . Look at me . I work when I can get it . But let the orders fall off , I 'm out . Why do n't you go on relief , they say . I do n't want relief . I want work  --  work  --  good work so I can feel like a man . I am a man , ai n't I ? Same as him in there . I got a job to do , ai n't I ? That 's what a man 's made for  --  some sort of job . Without it , he 's nothing . I 'm nothing and my children are hungry . He bows his head on his hands . PRATT pulls some money from his pocket and goes over and puts it into his hand . The man without looking up mumbles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . THE DOWN-AND-OUT Now raising his head and gesturing around . These buildings . I helped build ' em . Thousands  --  others like me  --  our sweat and muscle  --  But we do n't get nothing from it , nothing but words  --  words . When I come around here they say move on . He gets up and lurches up the steps and off at the left rear . The VOICE comes in again. p. 40 VOICE Let me repeat  --  every day is rich with opportunity . Then seize it . Work , push forward up the hill of life to victory . And this is the conclusion of the whole matter  --  seek ye the truth , and truth shall make ye free . There is a long rolling burst of applause in which UNCLE BENNY is again seen joining . HENRY PRATT With rough loudness . Yeh , where is this truth  --  this freedom ? Hell , it ai n't nowhere . BILLY PARKER With sudden vehemence . It is somewhere , Henry , if we could find it . HENRY PRATT You hunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Latin . And let me tell you there 's plenty of trouble ahead for you in the search . I know . Staring at the monument , and murmuring . E tenebre in lucem  --  from darkness into light . He goes out at the left front . PARKER stands looking over the statue . By this time the evening shadows have begun to fall , and the figures of the angel and the boy are muffled in gloom . Suddenly the campus lights come on , and from a hidden source somewhere in the hedge a light is thrown upon the monument and the angel 's ineffable stony smile . At the same moment the organ begins playing again , and the multitude of voices singing. p. 41 VOICES Alma mater , alma mater , See the light of heaven falls , Radiant on thy cherished emblems , Ancient trees and ivied halls . &nbsp; &nbsp; Then it 's blest  --  ever blest , &nbsp; &nbsp; Marked with favor from above . &nbsp; &nbsp; Hail to thee , ever hail , &nbsp; &nbsp; Mother in thy children 's love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ token , his face filled with a hurt and indefinable questioning. @x AS THE light of SCENE ONE dies , the singing and the music of the organ gradually dissolves into the far-away harmony of a great glee club singing . Hike Notre Dame " which continues while the curtain is down . This finally dissolves into a symphony playing Beethoven 's Eroica and the light comes up on the scene transformed into a student den in a fraternity house . PARKER is seated at his desk at the right front studying . The music comes from a radio-Victrola in the left rear . A long table is in the center , a sofa against the left wall , an easy chair at the left front and at the back a window with the curtains drawn . There is an entrance at the right and left front . The walls are decorated with pennants of different colleges  --  Yale , Harvard , Chicago , Southern California , Notre Dame , and the University of Georgia . PARKER 'S desk is lighted by a student 's lamp . For a moment he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wearily runs his hands through his disheveled hair , shakes his shoulders and finally lays his head over on his arm . The music of Beethoven fills the room with its sombre power . PARKER reaches up , turns off the light and lays his head again on his arm . The room is in darkness save for the pale trickle of winter moonshine which comes in at the window . Presently the door at the right opens , the light is switched on , and MITCHELL enters . JAMES MITCHELL Above the sound of the music . Hello , Park . PARKER straightens up , turns on the light , looks around and smooths back his rumpled hair. p. 43 BILLY PARKER Hello , Mitch . Have a good Thanksgiving ? JAMES MITCHELL Fervently . Oh , God , no words can tell it ! Throwing his suitcase on the sofa and coming over by PARKER . And that football game was a honey . You 've already seen the papers ? He cuts the victrola off . BILLY PARKER No . JAMES MITCHELL Staring at him . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aloud . " And as in the animal kingdom so in the natural society of primitive man  --  the strong oppress the weak , the clever outwit the stupid ones and the spoils are gathered by the powerful individuals . " Looking at the back of the book . " Philosophical Principles "  --  hum . Still it sounds about right . BILLY PARKER But later the author says the purpose of man is to change all that . JAMES MITCHELL How ? BILLY PARKER A little sheepishly . By education and the spiritual life . JAMES MITCHELL A philosopher would say that . Feeling in his pocket and pulling out a whiskey bottle . A woman named Josephine gave me that booze to remember her by . He uncorks the bottle . Well , here 's to remembrance . Sorry you do n't drink . He takes a long drink and shakes himself . Br  --  r  --  r  --  r . Replacing the cork and half-singing to himself . I gave my love a cherry without any stone  --  &nbsp; &nbsp; I gave my love  --  Uhm , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet breath fanned my cheeks in the dance  --  Sen-sen and licorice , by Allah . Ah , but no need to unroll her delicacies to your adamantine ear . p. 44 BILLY PARKER No , I 'm not particularly interested in your  --  er  --  Josephines . JAMES MITCHELL Mockingly . And more 's the pity . Beginning to quote . For soon we both must hie , &nbsp; &nbsp; To air the ditty , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to earth I. BILLY PARKER Looking up eagerly . That 's Housman , is n't it ? He 's a wonderful poet . JAMES MITCHELL Not on your tintype . Too gloomy . A pretty little co-ed taught me that as a freshman . And then she gave me the go-by . But I 've revenged her memory many , many times . Putting his bottle back into his pocket . By the way , your new side-kick  --  er  --  protg was at the game  --  that Latin shark , Henry Pratt . BILLY PARKER I did n't know he was my side-kick . JAMES MITCHELL Drunk as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policeman was taking him through the gate and he was yelling down with everything . Standing up , taking off his overcoat and shaking himself . Well , Thanksgiving Day has gone to sleep with its fathers , as the Scriptures say , and now back to business . The professors 'll be mean as hell tomorrow . Looking over at PARKER . Are you tied up with any sort of meeting for a while ? p. 45 BILLY PARKER I was thinking of listening in on that broadcast of President Jarvis . JAMES MITCHELL That 's right  --  I remember  --  " The Meaning of Education "  --  trying to raise another million dollars . But you do n't mind missing that . We 've got to help Johnny Meacham out on his Shakespeare . BILLY PARKER He was supposed to pass that freshman stuff off last year . JAMES MITCHELL Yeh , but he did n't . The professors sort of eased him along . Damn decent of ' em too . But now that fanatic old Doc Lawrence is on the warpath right . BILLY PARKER The trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MITCHELL You ca n't expect a great football player to study . He does enough for the university without it . And if he flunks that quiz tomorrow he 's out . The sound of voices is heard in the room at the rear . MITCHELL picks up his suitcase . I 'll go wash off this hangover and be right back . He starts towards the door at the left when the door at the right opens and PAT RIGGS , STUART EVANS and JOE HOWARD come in . RIGGS is a young man of twenty or twenty  --  one , a little below medium height , quick in his movements , red-faced and somewhat stout . He wears tortoise-shell spectacles . STUART EVANS is a fat lazy fellow of the same age , fair-haired , over-grown and six feet tall and wearing the sproutings of a young moustache . JOE HOWARD , also about twenty , is thin , dark-haired , swarthy and with shining white teeth. p. 46 BOYS Ad lib . Hello , Park , hello . See you corralled him , Mitch . Good . BILLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How 'd you like the game , Park ? BILLY PARKER That 's one I missed . JAMES MITCHELL Calling back . Park says it was fine  --  fine . PAT RIGGS You mean you missed Johnny 's seventy-yard run ? They all stare at him . STUART EVANS Covering the general embarrassment . Gee-ee-e , what a game that fellow played ! PAT RIGGS It 's the Rose Bowl for us this time . STUART EVANS And All-American for Johnny . PAT RIGGS Meacham 's seventy-yard run was a miracle , a holy miracle . JAMES MITCHELL Gruffly . Yeah , and we got to show him we appreciate it . He hurries out of the door . The boys seat themselves about the room  --  HOWARD on top of the table , RIGGS on the sofa and EVANS in the big chair . PARKER reaches over , gets MITCH 'S overcoat and bottle of whiskey and lays them out of the way on the window seat. p. 47 JOE HOWARD As EVANS pulls out a newspaper and begins to read industriously . You played hell , Park , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I hope not . PAT RIGGS And old man Carter threw the doors of his great mansion open wide for us . Such a reception ! Marble floors and gilded chandeliers . Turning to PARKER . Guess you heard about that radical guy  --  Henry Pratt  --  at the game ? BILLY PARKER Mitch was telling me . JOE HOWARD He 's off his nut somehow  --  With an empty laugh.  --  as the monkey said . STUART EVANS Still looking at his paper . Latin and Lenin have run him crazy like the Russians . JOE HOWARD Mitch says it 's his glands . PAT RIGGS He was a disgrace to the university . This time there 's no question  --  we 'll expel him . JOE HOWARD Yeh , out he goes . BILLY PARKER We must first get the facts of the case , fellows . JOE HOWARD We 've got the facts . p. 48 PAT RIGGS I should say so  --  and eighty thousand witnesses besides  --  Everybody saw him and those low-life guys parading in front of Mr. Carter 's box during the half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubles in his factories . JOE HOWARD Yeh , right when the cheer leader had busted the big paper drum and let the rabbits and the doves loose with the college colors  --  Then all of a sudden the booing began down in the stands . I thought Father 's eyes would fall out . " What the hell is that ? " he said . STUART EVANS Then the police rushed in with sirens and run the whole crowd out through the gates . PAT RIGGS When you think of all that Mr. Carter has done for this university , and then for one of our own students to act like that  --  They say the governor and President Jarvis apologized to Mr. Carter . Slapping his pockets . Golly , I come off without that Shakespeare book . BILLY PARKER Henry Pratt happens to have been brought up in poverty and hard knocks . He 's seen a lot more misery down in the poor section of town than we 'll ever see  --  JOE HOWARD Yeah , misery . If they 'd stick to their work down there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting for their rights . PAT RIGGS For cripe 's sake , Park . STUART EVANS Always ready to smooth out differences . Now you 're on the same old subject of capital and labor and you 'll never settle it . There 's something more important before the house than that . You 've got the book upstairs , have n't you , Billy ? Shakespeare , I mean . BILLY PARKER Yes , I have . STUART EVANS Run up and get it . BILLY PARKER What 's the quiz on ? PAT RIGGS It 's a study of Macbeth  --  the man of action and power . BILLY PARKER Oh  --  STUART EVANS And have you got any notes from the course when you took it ? BILLY PARKER I think so . STUART EVANS Well , for Pete 's sake bring ' em . BILLY PARKER All right , but I doubt they 'll do Meacham any good . Parker turns and goes out at the left front . JOE HOWARD Turning confidentially to the other two . I do n't get Billy 's attitude at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to remember he 's from a religious family . It 's the church streak in him . STUART EVANS Great guns , the church ai n't interested in these problems . Like the university it knows too darn well where its money comes from . Turning a sheet of his paper . Not that I 'm taking sides , you understand . I see the matter critically , as Professor Slocum says . JOE HOWARD I heard Park went down with that Pratt to a meeting of the workers in the mill village last week . STUART EVANS Oh well , labor questions are pretty important these days . JOE HOWARD And the newspapers are having a lot to say about the political theories going around this campus lately . PAT RIGGS Right . And such talk never helps our appropriations when the legislature meets . STUART EVANS Well , the newspapers have got to write about something . You 've found that out editing The Clarion . PAT RIGGS Yeh , and the letters that come to my desk show what a hawk 's eye the alumni keep on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here I must have got a hundred letters  --  most of ' em from wealthy alumni  --  and me just the editor of the college paper . Think what President Jarvis must have got . p. 51 JOE HOWARD Yes , and you notice we 've not had a tainted speaker here since . STUART EVANS Aw , that guy was harmless . He believes in Norman Thomas . JOE HOWARD Picking up a movie magazine and looking at it . Dad says it 's all the same  --  Socialist , Communist or Fascist like that C.I.O. guy  --  they all want to overthrow the constitution , and the rest of it . Half-singing . " Hot baby , hot baby , let me cool you with my fan . " Suddenly in the distance the brass band is heard once more striking up the lively air of the Alma Mater song , and above it rises the husky breathing sound of cheering  --  " Rah  --  rah  --  rah ! Team  --  team  --  team ! " PAT RIGGS As they listen . That 's the scrubs getting in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment they sit listening to the far-away cheering and music of the band . EVANS begins softly singing and both HOWARD and RIGGS join in with a harmonious mumbling . Alma mater , alma mater , See the light of heaven fallsRadiant on thy cherished emblems , Ancient trees and ivied halls . Now the three stand up and sing in close harmony and EVANS who has been sitting with his hat on takes it respectfully off.  --  Then it 's blest , ever blest , Marked with favor from above.Hail to thee , ever hail , Mother in thy children 's love . HOWARD bends forward like a cheer leader , and shooting his fists back and forth , leads them in a yell.  --  Rah  --  rah  --  rah ! Team  --  team  --  team ! They all sit down again as MITCHELL comes in through the rear door . He looks around the room. p. 52 JAMES MITCHELL Where 's Park ? STUART EVANS Gone after Shakespeare . JAMES MITCHELL I was afraid maybe he 'd skipped out . JOE HOWARD Say , Mitch , tell us what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a sort of close friend to him . PAT RIGGS He seems to have something on his mind all the time . STUART EVANS Yeh , think of him not even going to the game . JAMES MITCHELL Sitting down . He 's inhibited  --  simply inhibited . STUART EVANS Whadda you mean , inhibited ? JAMES MITCHELL Shut up inside  --  needs to bust loose . It 's a biological matter . Sex working on him . STUART EVANS Uh-uh ! PAT RIGGS Right , somebody ought to cure him of Rachel Jarvis . It must hurt , for she 's got all the prerequisites , as it says in the catalogue . When she takes off her specs she 's a raving beauty , boys . You heard me the first time . JOE HOWARD That 's the trouble with her  --  she wo n't keep ' em off . JAMES MITCHELL Some of these nights I 'm going to take Park down town to Miss Mary 's place  --  if I have to drag him . That little blue-eyed girl  --  what 's her name ? p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOWARD Embarrassed . Quit it .  --  Anyhow her name 's Louise . JAMES MITCHELL Yeh , I 'll turn him over to Louise . She 'll make him forget Rachel Jarvis . STUART EVANS Phoo , it 's not just girls with Park . He 's got other things on his mind  --  Weakening.  --  I believe he has . JAMES MITCHELL What things ? STUART EVANS I do n't exactly know  --  life  --  what he 's going to do in the world  --  everything  --  social problems . Roosevelt himself says we got to be sociological . That 's why Park 's started studying so hard in his senior year  --  trying to get straightened out . I believe so . PAT RIGGS Indicating the open book . And he 's picked a devil of a subject to straighten him out  --  philosophy . STUART EVANS Oh , I do n't know . I took a course in Spinoza last year under old Dr. Everett . I kind of liked it . He teaches you to think . PAT RIGGS About what ? STUART EVANS About  --  well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RIGGS What truth ? STUART EVANS Grinning and drawling . You 've got me there , Pat . I do n't exactly know  --  just truth , I guess . JOE HOWARD I tried that course once . I could n't make heads or tails of it  --  all theory . Did n't give me any facts . PAT RIGGS Yeh , facts , you got to have facts in the modern world . JAMES MITCHELL Heartily . Right , me lads , in a scientific age you got to have facts before you have any theories . That 's one thing you learn in biology , plenty of facts . JOE HOWARD Same thing in economics . Dr. Newell always says , " Goods and services and human wants are the real facts in this life . " PAT RIGGS And Dr. Bennett says in Astronomy As if quoting.  --  " Gentlemen , we are not dealing with religion or fiction but facts  --  and it is an incontrovertible fact that the sun is losing its energy at the rate of sixteen trillion tons a year , ultimately to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tiny ball we call the earth man and all his dreams will perish . " JOE HOWARD Shuddering . Ugh . p. 55 PAT RIGGS Not that it makes any difference one way or the other . It 's all mechanistic anyway , including man , so the Germans say in their new theory . JAMES MITCHELL That 's an old theory  --  of course man 's a machine . STUART EVANS But I thought man had a  --  er  --  soul . JOE HOWARD Dr. Walton says he 's a mechanistic animal  --  man is . JAMES MITCHELL Right . The word soul is a confusion in terms . PAT RIGGS Still , a little bit of soul would n't hurt , would it ? JAMES MITCHELL Disgustedly . You fellows have n't learned the first word about scientific research . When I win the Nobel prize for creating life in the test tube I 'll prove for you the whole thing is mechanical . STUART EVANS Always drawling . I read in a Hearst newspaper the other day where they 'd made a pig in the laboratory at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? PAT RIGGS If it was made at Harvard you know darn well it was a pure-bred . STUART EVANS And they said the pig squealed two times and died , and they never were able to get any life into him again . p. 56 JOE HOWARD Was it a him or a her ? PAT RIGGS Fool , they 're not interested in sex at Harvard . STUART EVANS Hah  --  hah . Anyhow it did n't say what it was . PAT RIGGS What did n't say ? STUART EVANS The pig . Ironically . I suppose , Mitch , that 's the high point in New England culture and from now on the Cabots and the Lodges will start backward towards the parasitic stage . JAMES MITCHELL Glaring at them . God , you fellows give me a belly-ache . You may laugh now , but someday we will make pigs in the laboratory  --  babies too . JOE HOWARD Give me the baby end of it , will you ? I wo n't even need a laboratory . JAMES MITCHELL Throwing up his hands angrily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise and reading intently . Cripes , here 's where another student has committed suicide out west . JOE HOWARD If you 've got to read , read something pleasant . Read about the game . STUART EVANS I already know that by heart .  --  Meacham goes around left end for six yards . Meacham bucks center for a first down .  --  Say , that 's a queer way to do it  --  This guy went out into the woods with a portable victrola and a pistol , played a record , Mozart gavotte  --  then  --  bang . Why in the devil would a man want to kill himself ? p. 57 PAT RIGGS Oh , sometimes a fellow gets all mixed up maybe  --  do n't know where to turn  --  everything looks black  --  goes nuts . JOE HOWARD It happens at all universities now and then . You remember last year when that sophomore here  --  PAT RIGGS Yes , I helped hunt for him . We found him in a gulley a month afterward . JOE HOWARD Let 's get off that subject . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mitch before Park gets back . PAT RIGGS Yeh . Pulling a paper quickly out of his pocket . We want your advice about commencement speaker , Mitch . JAMES MITCHELL I thought you political bosses met the other night and passed out all the offices . PAT RIGGS We Alphas are due to have that honor this year . It was all agreed for Howard here . And now we 've just learned the Dekes have double-crossed us and are running their man Jones  --  you know him  --  as dumb a gourd as ever the frost bit , but popular . He 'd beat Howard . JAMES MITCHELL He would that . He knows the ropes . STUART EVANS We want to run Park  --  in a quiet way at first , you understand . p. 58 JAMES MITCHELL But Parker was given the presidency of the student body through your steam rolling . We need n't try to play the hog . PAT RIGGS We 're not , but if we can put out a man that can win we 'd be fools not to do it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would , maybe , if you swung the science boys with us . STUART EVANS He 'd pull a big non-fraternity vote all right  --  he 's  --  democratic and all that . PAT RIGGS And besides he 's named after old man Carter . William Carter Parker is the namesake of our fraternity brother  --  the great multimillionaire , William Carter  --  get the idea ? STUART EVANS William Carter 's the name  --  get the name of William Carter  --  savvy ? JAMES MITCHELL And Billy 's election would be one more mark of appreciation for the new Carter Memorial tower . PAT RIGGS And for other beneficences still to come  --  among them greater football players and a new laboratory or two . JOE HOWARD And an honor for us Alphas , do n't forget that . STUART EVANS Oh , my friends , these are subtile matters  --  Half-singing . And every little bit added to what you gotMakes just a little bit more . p. 59 JAMES MITCHELL As loyal alumni , you fellows are starting early . PAT RIGGS And so I write in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the A.P .  --  William Carter Parker , member of the Alpha Tau Beta fraternity , godson of the great capitalist and philanthropist , William Carter  --  that loyal alumnus  --  than which there is none whom  --  is elected to the highest commencement honor  --  Young Parker , affectionately known as Billy the campus over , when interviewed today by your correspondent , with becoming modesty said he was deeply grateful for the great trust reposed in him and would do his best to be worthy of the sacred obligation and worthy of the illustrious name he bears  --  JOE HOWARD Applauding . Hear , hear ! JAMES MITCHELL There 's Meacham . Calling out as a heavy step is heard off at the right . High , Johnny ! The door at the right is flung open and JOHNNY MEACHAM comes striding in . His face is adorned with patches of sticking plaster . The boys turn swiftly towards him , filling the air with congratulations as they slap him on the back and shake his hand . BOYS Ad lib . Hello there , Johnny . Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? p. 60 JOHNNY MEACHAM Groggy from former praise and glory . Thanks , fellows , thanks . He sinks down in a chair at the end of the table . PARKER comes in with a book and some papers in his hand . BILLY PARKER Slapping him on the shoulder . We ought to have a medal for you , Johnny . JOHNNY MEACHAM Happily . I gave ' em all I had , Park old boy , all I had . It looks like the Rose Bowl for us . O Mother Machree , it 's a dream  --  a sweet dream  --  we 've had to wait three years for this . When I went out on that field I says to myself  --  STUART EVANS All brisk and businesslike . Now , none of that ! We 've got to leave that game outside the door for our time 's short . Throwing aside his paper and pulling himself up to the table . The matter before the house is this man Shakespeare . And it 's urgent . The boys all seat themselves at the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay . He pushes himself up to the table all ready for action . What 's it about ? How far am I behind , Evvy ? p. 61 STUART EVANS As he pulls a notebook out of his pocket . Plenty . First thing is a term paper on the " Decay of King Lear 's Character . " JOHNNY MEACHAM That 's the play where they put out somebody 's eyes , ai n't it ? With shuddering reminiscence . Uhm ! And a fellow had a long speech in it about " to be or not to be . " STUART EVANS Hah , he remembers it ! Looking over at HOWARD . You got it , Joe ? HOWARD pulls a folded thick paper out of his pocket and hands it to MEACHAM . JOE HOWARD Here you are , Johnny  --  all typed off for you  --  JOHNNY MEACHAM Taking it . Thanks . Whew , it 's a long thing . Did n't know I could write so much . JOE HOWARD And you 've done yourself proud in that , Johnny . It 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little too good  --  better be a " D. " STUART EVANS Consulting his notebook again . And then a paper on the subject of " Love and Honor " as illustrated in the play " Antony and Cleopatra . " JOHNNY MEACHAM With a groan . Great God ! p. 62 STUART EVANS All right , Riggs . RIGGS pulls out another fat paper from his pocket and hands it to MEACHAM . PAT RIGGS That ought to pull you a " C-plus . " JOHNNY MEACHAM Overcome . Thanks , fellows , thanks . This is a surprise . Why did n't you tell me ? PAT RIGGS Afraid you 'd quit studying . JOHNNY MEACHAM You might as well  --  I have n't studied anyhow . Mournfully . It would have eased my mind if you had , it would , boys . How much I owe you ? PAT RIGGS Catching sight of PARKER 'S sober face . Aw shut up  --  nothing . Quickly and firmly . Remember it 's your work  --  we just smoothed it up for you . JOHNNY MEACHAM Sure  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . JOE HOWARD He can pay for that if he wants to . Three or four dollars . JOHNNY MEACHAM I 'll remember it . More brightly now . What else , Evvy ? STUART EVANS Sternly . That quiz on " Macbeth " tomorrow . p. 63 JOHNNY MEACHAM Wagging his head as if in pain . I do n't know a thing about that drammer . Tried to read it going up on the train , but I could n't . Had to keep thinking about them new signals the coach had drilled us in . Turning to them . Remember that play we pulled off in the fourth quarter ? Jernigan falls back like he 's about to pass , I come tearing around behind him , take the ball , Jernigan streaks around left end , and Lipinsky who has  --  STUART EVANS Calling out loudly . Shakespeare ! JOHNNY MEACHAM Wilting . I 'm sorry . Okay , boys , shoot . STUART EVANS You got any advice , Park ? PARKER is silent . PAT RIGGS What you say , Park ? You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right , Park , let 's get going . What 'd we better start with first  --  the plot ? BILLY PARKER Abruptly . Yeh , he 'd better be able to synopsize the plot . STUART EVANS Yeah , that 's right , old Doc Lawrence always says , " Synopsize the plot . " Okay , tell us the plot , Johnny . p. 64 JOHNNY MEACHAM How the devil can I when I 've not read it ? Coming back on the train last night I found that passage you said memorize and I worked on that . How does it begin ? Something about my life going all to pieces and nothing seems to matter . STUART EVANS How does it go , Park ? BILLY PARKER "  --  my way of life Is fall'n into the sere , the yellow leaf  --  ? " JOHNNY MEACHAM Admiringly . Yeh , that 's right . PAT RIGGS We better get the plot first . STUART EVANS You know it , Park ? BILLY PARKER Sharply as he opens the book and obviously makes an effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many centuries ago there lived in Scotland a lord by the name of Macbeth . He had ambitions , dreams of power . JOHNNY MEACHAM Like Mr. Carter , huh ? He 's a man of power , great power . BILLY PARKER All right then  --  like Mr. Carter . One day he meets some witches on a heath  --  JOHNNY MEACHAM Now just what is a heath , Park ? STUART EVANS Aw , it 's a big field , Johnny . Say he met the witches in a field , Park . p. 65 BILLY PARKER All right . The great lord Macbeth met the witches in a field , and they tell him that some day he will be king of Scotland . Well , and when he gets home , Lady Macbeth  --  that 's his wife  --  persuades him to kill King Duncan , who is spending that particular night under his roof . It is evident that MEACHAM 'S foggy attention gradually wanders off as PARKER continues talking , staring ahead of him . After King Duncan is killed Macbeth has himself crowned king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of dictator , he sets out to kill Banquo 's son who the witches have prophesied would some day rule Scotland . You see , Macbeth wanted to keep the monarchy in his own family . Banquo himself is killed , but  --  He consults the book . And now breaking in comes the voice of MEACHAM muttering as if to himself . JOHNNY MEACHAM The best man they had against us was Isaacson . Two hundred and ten pounds  --  human dynamite . And he was the only thing between me and the goal , and when I pulled around him , he squatted down to take me . Squatting forward out of his chair . A-ah , but how I stiff-armed the crook ! Ah-ooh ! I felt his neckbone crack . He pantomimes a terrific stiff-arm and then suddenly wakes up and stutters in embarrassment . Sorry , fellows ! p. 66 STUART EVANS Kind , but stern . You better get that game out of your mind , or you 'll never see the girls in Hollywood . JOHNNY MEACHAM All right , all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table , businesslike again . BILLY PARKER Where Macduff and Malcolm get ready to attack Macbeth . JOHNNY MEACHAM Who were they anyway ? BILLY PARKER Macduff was a Scotch general and Malcolm was King Duncan 's son . They attack Macbeth and Malcolm is killed . Then Macduff kills Macbeth and in the last scene he comes in with Macbeth 's head . JOHNNY MEACHAM You mean they cut his head off and bring it in on the stage ? Whew-w ! BILLY PARKER With sudden roughness . Yeh , like it shows in that new war picture . You thought that was great . STUART EVANS Angrily . We 're not talking about war pictures  --  We 're talking about Shakespeare . JOHNNY MEACHAM With sudden explosive disgust . All right , go ahead and talk . What the hell do I care about Shakespeare ? Turning . towards them pleadingly . When I get out of here I 'm going to be a foreman in a coal mine . Reminiscently . Clang-clang , hear the old wheel go round . What good will Shakespeare ever do me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 67 STUART EVANS But you got to learn to read and write even to be a foreman . JOHNNY MEACHAM Angrily . I can already read and write . STUART EVANS I mean you ought to have some background . PAT RIGGS Yeh , they might want to make you president of the company some day . JOHNNY MEACHAM I do n't want to be president of the company . I want to be a foreman . JAMES MITCHELL Look here  --  let 's face the facts . Johnny 's got to pass this Shakespeare and we 've got to teach it to him . Loudly . Get busy , you crumbs . JOHNNY MEACHAM Suddenly making an effort at quotation . " My life has fallen into the dead and yellow  --  " STUART EVANS Striking the table with his hand . " My way of life has fallen into the sere , the yellow leaf ! " How many lines is it , Park ? BILLY PARKER I think he 'd better learn the other quotation . They say Doc Lawrence quotes it every morning before he gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief candle ! Life 's but a walking shadow , a poor playerThat struts and frets his hour upon the stageAnd then is heard no more ; it is a taleTold by an idiot , full of sound and fury , Signifying nothing . " p. 68 JOHNNY MEACHAM Staring at PARKER . Ai n't that beautiful  --  when you read it , Park . But , Lord , that man Shakespeare hated the world , did n't he ? Striking the table now . Well , I do n't hate it . And why do they try to teach all this stuff ? Helplessly . Oh , I tell you , the way they make a football player suffer at these colleges  --  it " ai n't worth it . If I could break my contract  --  STUART EVANS Yelling . Shut up ! JOHNNY MEACHAM Yeh , yeh , my tongue slipped . Groaning . But I ca n't learn it , fellows . It all goes around in my head . Gripping his face with both hands and shuddering . It 's driving me nuts . I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest . I do n't know what it all means  --  all this about idiots and shadows on a stage  --  I 'll never know what it means . Raging . Let me out of this college . It ai n't worth two thousand a year . Striking the table a shattering blow . Let me out ! I 'm gon na leave here . The boys reach forward and push him down in his seat . STUART EVANS Take it easy . old boy , take it easy . While this is going on PRATT enters at the left rear and stands looking on. p. 69 PAT RIGGS You 've got to learn it , Johnny . JOHNNY MEACHAM Staring before him . They ai n't nothing to do , boys . I ca n't pass that stuff . And I tell you I wo n't face that little man again . I 'm scared of him . He lays his head hopelessly over on the table . STUART EVANS Come on , Johnny , snap out of it . MEACHAM groans and wabbles his head from side to side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOE HOWARD Somebody think of something . PAT RIGGS Are n't we thi1.king ? JOE HOWARD Maybe we could kidnap old Doc Lawrence or somebody  --  STUART EVANS Got any ideas , Park ? PARKER is silent . JOHNNY MEACHAM His head still on the table . If it is a question of getting coal out of the ground or what to do in case of a cave-in  --  something with sense in it , I could  --  could  --  Murmuring and yawning . I 'm tired  --  tired . I could sleep right here  --  He closes his eyes . STUART EVANS Yelling . Wake up , I tell you ! But MEACHAM makes no reply . EVANS flings up his hands . Of all the dumb heads ! p. 70 PAT RIGGS Come on , Mitch , think fast . JAMES MITCHELL Shaking his head . It 's got me stumped . Guess we lose him . EVANS sits pulling his hair in desperation . HENRY PRATT Calling out from the shadows at the rear . Ai n't that too bad ! They all bounce around in amazement as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How'n the hell did you get in here ? HENRY PRATT Through the keyhole . I want to see Park a minute . PAT RIGGS Do n't they ever knock on doors where you come from ? HENRY PRATT Sure I knocked , but Johnny there was having his fits and you did n't hear me . STUART EVANS Park will see you in a few minutes , wo n't you , Park ? BILLY PARKER Yeh , Henry . JOE HOWARD If you would n't mind waiting outside . HENRY PRATT Picking up one of the papers and looking at it . Oh , do n't notice me , I wo n't squeal on your crooked work . PAT RIGGS Angrily . What crooked work ? p. 71 HENRY PRATT Oh , it 's obvious  --  doing Meacham 's themes for him , and it 's a breach of university rules . Not that I give a damn personally . Honor do n't bother me  --  Ironically.  --  the way it does Billy . PAT RIGGS Not after the way you acted yesterday . HENRY PRATT That 's all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , ai n't it ? I had the right of free speech . STUART EVANS Yeh , but not that sort of speech . PAT RIGGS And besides , you were drunk . HENRY PRATT I was n't drunk . Of course I 'd had a drink or two but that was so I could get up courage enough to tell old Millionaire Carter what I thought of him . And I did too . I stood right up in front of his box and hollered , " Dirty Capitalist " ! My drinking was all in the cause . JOE HOWARD Well , the honor council 's going to hang your hide on a barn door to dry . You better start packing . HENRY PRATT That 's what I want to see you about , Park . You 're the only one in this holy Sanhedrin of knaves with any bowels of compassion . JOE HOWARD That 's enough , Pratt , get out . PAT RIGGS Yeh , this is one time that not even Park will be able to help you . p. 72 BILLY PARKER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Staring at RIGGS . So you already want to turn me out ? PAT RIGGS Not only want to  --  going to . HENRY PRATT Angrily . Then I 'll protest , I 'll take it to the Civil Liberties Union , I 'll employ the I.L.D.  --  I 'll invoke the constitution  --  PAT RIGGS They 've got nothing to do with the rules of an educational institution . JAMES MITCHELL We 'll see that you get a fair trial . HENRY PRATT I do n't want a fair trial . I want to stay in school , so I wo n't disgrace my mother . I 'll graduate in June and then I can go to hell in my own way . She can have the sheepskin to frame . PAT RIGGS But do n't you call getting out and making a spectacle of yourself a disgrace to her ? HENRY PRATT With some sort of twisted inner conviction . I had to do it . Park , you 've been down in the night-town and seen that cesspool of iniquity and suffering down there . You know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocent guys in jail accused of stirring up trouble . By God , they have a right to stir up trouble if it means better wages , better conditions . My Lord , Billy , rather than cussing me out you fellows ought a be proud of me. p. 73 BILLY PARKER Hesitating . I 'll  --  I 'll do what I can , Henry . See you tomorrow . HENRY PRATT All right , that 's a promise . And by God , I 'm going to hold you to it . Goodnight  --  you got to get on with your dirty work and I better be going . And say , cheer up . You look kinder glum . He starts away , then turns back . By the way , Park , my mother hopes you 'll come down and eat some of her sandwiches again . For some unaccountable reason she liked you . BILLY PARKER Thanks , Henry , I will . PRATT goes out at the left , his old hat jammed down over his brow . They stand a moment staring after him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lips . Ahm  --  the premises taste slightly foul . PAT RIGGS God , what a character ! STUART EVANS Anxiously as MEACHAM begins to snore . The council can cook Pratt 's hash later . We 've got this  --  Indicating MEACHAM.  --  on our hands . Fervently . The matter before the house is Meacham and it 's urgent . Park , for God 's sake  --  where is your brilliant mind ? Think of something . p. 74 BILLY PARKER All right  --  why do n't we go the whole hog  --  do it up brown ? JAMES MITCHELL What ? BILLY PARKER Tell a lie , lie out of it . JOE HOWARD Listen , will you ? That 's Park talking . STUART EVANS What sort of lie ? Grimly . I 'm ready for anything . What is it , Park ? BILLY PARKER But on condition that we do n't expel Pratt . PAT RIGGS Good Lord , you ca n't make that sort of bargain , Park . BILLY PARKER Oh , yes , I can . If Meacham stays in school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise . STUART EVANS After a moment . All right , if your scheme works to get Meacham by . What you say , fellows ? The boys look about with averted eyes an instant and then , with the exception of PARKER , nod agreement . PAT RIGGS Even if the student council did n't expel Pratt , the professors would . STUART EVANS But we have student government , do n't we ? Yes , we 'll just keep mum . All right , what 's your scheme about Johnny ? Not that I believe it 's any good or we 'd have already thought of it . p. 75 BILLY PARKER Breaking into a hard satiric laugh . Hah-hah  --  education ! All this noble effort , these grandiose buildings , this matchless equipment , millions and millions of money and men and all for what ? PAT RIGGS Never mind , fellows , let him rave . Go ahead , what 's your scheme about Meacham ? BILLY PARKER Stepping over and shaking the sleeper . Wake up , you hunk of blubber . We 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knocking over a chair . Then he suddenly squats crouching on the floor , his hands stretched out like a great ape , harsh groans pouring from his throat . EVANS leaps over and slaps him on the shoulder . STUART EVANS We 're not playing football , you fool . MEACHAM whirls and strikes savagely in the air , then shakes his head and stares foggily about him . JOHNNY MEACHAM Ahm  --  I was all set for the tackle . Sorry , fellows . He sits sheepishly down . BILLY PARKER How bad did you hurt your ankle in that game , Johnny ? JOHNNY MEACHAM Staring at PARKER questioningly . I did n't hurt my ankle . p. 76 BILLY PARKER Oh , yes you did , and the pain of it 's killing you . STUART EVANS O my prophetic soul ! JOHNNY MEACHAM A ragged smile illuminating his countenance as he begins to comprehend . I see , said the blind man . Then it better be my knee , for that 's what was hurt before . PAT RIGGS As if holding a newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injury in Notre Dame epic . First thought to be only a trifle , now proves to be serious and the brilliant half-back is confined to the infirmary for a week . JOE HOWARD Applauding . Yeigh ! OTHERS Rah-rah  --  team , team ! STUART EVANS Park , you 're a genius . JOE HOWARD That was simple  --  why did n't we think of it ? JOHNNY MEACHAM Gripping PARKER 'S hand fervently . You 've saved my life . PAT RIGGS As if writing on a pad . It is hoped that he will be sufficiently recovered for the all-important game next Saturday . That will take care of him for a while . Evvy , get it into The Clarion , big type . See Doc Lawrence has a copy at his front door by daybreak in the morning . p. 77 JAMES MITCHELL Clever , clever . Staring about him admiringly . You fellows will go far in politics when you get out of here . JOE HOWARD Pat 's already picked the year he plans to become Governor . STUART EVANS Keep that quiet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PAT RIGGS Rising and speaking oratorically into the air . And if my friends should so see fit to call me into the arena of public service I shall lay whatever humble gifts I may possess upon the altar of this my native state . I shall conescrate myself to  --  JOE HOWARD Applauding . Hear ! Hear ! PAT RIGGS And furthermore  --  Off at the right the sound of girls ' voices is heard . VOICES Calling . Boys  --  Whoo-ee ! Anybody home ? Heigh , Billy , Johnny-Eigh , Mitch ! JOE HOWARD We got visitors . The CHAPERON , a sharp-eyed lady , opens the door at the rear and sticks her head in . CHAPERON Oh , there you are , Mr. Meacham . I brought some of the Chi Omicron girls over . p. 78 JOHNNY MEACHAM Starting to rise . Sure , I 'll be right with you . EVANS springs out of his seat and grabs MEACHAM 'S shoulders , forcing him down . STUART EVANS To the CHAPERON . Sorry , uh  --  Johnny 's in bad shape . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head and groans . CHAPERON All fluttering with sympathy . Why , I 'm so sorry ! We had n't heard . Turning and calling behind her . Girls , did you hear that ? STUART EVANS Firmly . Just a minute , please ma'am . He closes the door in her face . All right , Joe , you take that side and I 'll take this . EVANS and HOWARD pull MEACHAM to his feet and with his great arms draped over their shoulders , they help him hobbling towards the door , with MITCHELL and RIGGS following fatherly behind . The young people are heard applauding and then they stop . Murmurs of sympathy rise from among them . VOICES What 's happened to him ? Too bad ! Say , what 's happened , Johnny ? STUART EVANS Calling out loudly . He 's suffering  --  terribly . Make way  --  make way ! p. 79 JOHNNY MEACHAM With a deep groan . Go easy , boys , easy . STUART EVANS Go ahead and enjoy yourselves . We 'll be right back . Johnny needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infirmary . JOHNNY MEACHAM Faintly , as he raises a weak hand in greeting . Do n't worry , good people  --  friends , I mean  --  I 'll be back in there on the big day . They applaud him ad lib . VOICES You tell ' em , Johnny.That 's the spirit , old man.We 're behind you . VOICE Shrilly . Split it for Johnny . VOICES In a chorus . M-E-A-C-H-A-M  --  " Meacham . " Rah  --  rah  --  team  --  team ! The door swings closed behind them . PARKER stands alone in the room . He turns , slumps down in a chair , sits gazing ahead of him a moment , and then reaches over for his book . He feels something in the coat behind him , and pulls out MITCHELL 'S bottle . He holds it in one hand and the book in the other as if considering their relative merits . Then he suddenly lays the book on the table , uncorks the bottle , and takes a long drink , his face writhing in pain under the burning liquid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the table . Off at the right a fox trot begins . He sits listening . The door at the right opens and RACHEL comes in . She is beautifully gowned , and enveloped in an ermine collared cloak . But her tortoise-shell glasses are in their place. p. 80 RACHEL JARVIS Calling . Hello , Billy . PARKER looks quickly around , then sits staring ahead of him as before . BILLY PARKER What is it ? RACHEL JARVIS Coming over towards him . Sitting all alone in this gloom . I knew it . BILLY PARKER As he rises . I 'm communing with my thoughts . RACHEL pushes herself up on the table , swinging her feet and looking at him . RACHEL JARVIS Funny Johnny did n't find out about his leg earlier . Taking her handkerchief from her bag and dabbing her nose . What 's the trouble  --  water on the knee ? BILLY PARKER Gruffly . No , on the brain . RACHEL JARVIS Sounds aquatic  --  fishy , does n't it ? BILLY PARKER Roughly . No , crooked . RACHEL JARVIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But do n't take it so seriously . Suppose it is n't exactly what you call straight . We live in a social pattern of urge and end , and  --  p. 81 BILLY PARKER Sourly . As Dr. Winford says , eigh ? Well , damn Dr. Winford ! Sternly as he gazes up at her . And all spectacles too . He reaches up quickly and lifts them off . RACHEL JARVIS Billy ! BILLY PARKER Staring at her . My Lord , but you 're beautiful ! RACHEL JARVIS Why , Billy , you 've been drinking . BILLY PARKER Yeh . He pulls her suddenly down from the table into his arms . Do you feel like a sister or mother now ? He holds her tightly to him and kisses her . She struggles in his arms . The door at the right opens and the CHAPERON comes in , looks about her and then starts back in surprise . CHAPERON Sorry , but if you young people are going to pet you 'll have to do it out here in the open . RACHEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking off in embarrassment . Why , it 's Mr. Parker and Miss Jarvis . Glancing at the whiskey bottle . And liquor too . Whatever are we coming to ! RACHEL JARVIS It 's not his fault , Miss  --  p. 82 BILLY PARKER Roughly . Shut up , Rachel ! He bows to the CHAPERON . If there 's any explaining I 'll do it . CHAPERON Oh , I guess there 's no damage done  --  but you know it 's not supposed to be allowed here  --  BILLY PARKER Almost sharply . Yes , I know . The CHAPERON looks at him , smiles coldly and then turns back into the rear room , the door swinging closed behind her . In the distance the great bell begins to toll . RACHEL looks at her watch . RACHEL JARVIS I 've  --  I 've got to go . BILLY PARKER Handing her her spectacles . Time to feed your rats , I know . RACHEL JARVIS Yes . She stands a moment gazing at the floor . Presently she looks over at PARKER and speaks with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time you 've ever tried to kiss me , Billy . BILLY PARKER I did kiss you . He turns towards her , she quickly puts on her spectacles . All right , psychology is in control again . He bows to her coldly , sits down and picks up his book . She remains in an attitude of indecision an instant and then as the great bell tolls more strongly in the distance , she turns and starts out at the right . But at the door she hesitates and then finally comes back half-way across the room. p. 83 RACHEL JARVIS Staring at his bowed head . I ca n't  --  ca n't stand to see you like this , Billy . BILLY PARKER Without looking up . Ca n't , eh ? A lot you care . RACHEL JARVIS I  --  Anybody would care . That 's why I came over here  --  to talk to you . BILLY PARKER Mother 's heart grieving  --  hah ? " Oh where is my wandering boy tonight ? " RACHEL JARVIS Stop it . BILLY PARKER All right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustration , my lack of personal adequacy  --  whatever the lingo you scientists use . He springs up and begins pacing the room . RACHEL JARVIS You need somebody to talk to you all right  --  some straight hard facts . Dr. Winford said so today . BILLY PARKER Hah-hah , he did . Well , you tell Dr. Winford to leave me out of his conversation . RACHEL JARVIS He really is anxious for you to come to see him . BILLY PARKER I 'm not going , I tell you . RACHEL JARVIS He could help you . p. 84 BILLY PARKER And I keep telling you he ca n't . I do n't like him . He stops by the radio and leans his elbows on it . RACHEL JARVIS But what are you going to do ? You ca n't go on like this . BILLY PARKER As Pratt says , go to hell in my own way . I can do that . RACHEL JARVIS Her voice trembling . And  --  and that 's what you are doing  --  going to  --  to pieces . BILLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this  --  this maze of cheating and lying and confusion ? He sweeps his arm in a wide gesture over the scene . RACHEL JARVIS I  --  I  --  oh . I do n't know what to say any more . She turns and goes out at the right . PARKER continues to lean on the radio . Abstractedly he fumbles with the button on the dial and switches it on . The radio hums a moment and then a far  --  away oratorical voice slithers the air . VOICE And it was for this purpose our great university was created  --  to stand as a bulwark against all the forces of evil and ignorance that would hurl man back to barbarism . This is the meaning of education . The VOICE fades out an instant and then surges back into the room . And as president , I stand here and pledge myself afresh to you  --  to you who have responded so generously here tonight  --  to the ideal of truth and human service . And I pledge likewise the corps of noble teachers . It is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have caught the gleam . Unselfish , devoted in the cause of truth , they have labored unceasingly that  --  PARKER cuts the radio off and stands looking before him . Going back to his chair , he sits down , picks up the book and begins reading again . Suddenly he hurls the book from him and bows his head over in his hands. @x At the Black Out the bell continues ringing , and as it dies away the glee club is heard singing " Fair Harvard . " It too fades out , and the light goes up on the scene transformed into the office of DEAN WILLIAMS . The pennants have been removed , the furniture changed about , and the flats shifted . In the center back is the DEAN 's desk with a dictaphone resting on it . At the right and left are two windows through which the campus lights are visible as well as other myriad eyes of light coming from the far-off windows of different dormitories . The windows are slightly raised from the bottom , and ever and anon the chuff-chuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the wall between the windows at the center back is a full portrait of the university founder , a man of strong early nineteenth-century visage and dress  --  a sort of mixture of pioneer trader and jurist  --  and resembling in an indefinable way the great WILLIAM CARTER himself . There are a few other pictures on the walls , representing historical campus scenes and buildings . Several chairs are at the right and left . When the curtain rises DEAN WILLIAMS is seated behind the desk speaking into the mouthpiece of the dictaphone . He is a quiet-mannered man of middle age , with well-brushed slightly graying hair , dressed in dark well-cut clothes , and wearing shell-rimmed spectacles . CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS And furthermore , your excellency , our crowded condition requires the utmost consideration at the next appropriation meeting . The registration this year has increased twenty per cent , and I am sure that you and your distinguished colleagues will see to it that our progress will continue in the future as in the past . Our watchword is forward . The SECRETARY , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left and comes over to the desk . The DEAN looks up at her and lifts his hand signifying " One moment , please , " then continues . With all good wishes and high esteem , sincerely yours  --  mmm  --  mmm  --  , Dean of the College of Liberal Arts . The SECRETARY reaches over to take the mouthpiece . The DEAN continues . P. S. I am herewith attaching as a final sheet the statement of our immediate library needs . Hanging up the mouth-piece . I 'd like six copies of that for the trustees ' meeting . p. 87 SECRETARY Taking off the roll . Sorry I interrupted . I heard " The watchword is forward " and thought you 'd finished . CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS Tell the gentlemen to come in . SECRETARY Going to the door at the right . Gentlemen . DRS . EVERETT , WINFORD , BENNETT , COLEMAN and LAW  --  RENCE enter . DR . EVERETT is a dapper little old man with a ruddy dewy  --  fresh face , dressed in a well  --  cut suit and gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slightly bulbous  --  faced and academic only in his delicate gold  --  rimmed glasses . His manner is much that of a pushing get  --  there insurance salesman . And perhaps it should be , for he is still young enough to be certain of his science and old enough to have authority over his students . BENNETT , the astro  --  physicist , is a tall womanish looking man of fifty or more , with dank graying hair parted slightly off the middle . Everything about him bespeaks gentility and gentleness as well as a touch of world  --  tired boredom . His voice is soft and liquid , his whole appearance soft . The committee are engaged in conversation as they enter . DR . LAWRENCE 'S high  --  pitched voice is heard coming out a little more clearly than the others. p. 88 DR . LAWRENCE It would be a great feather in the cap of the university  --  Nodding to DEAN WILLIAMS . Evening , CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS We were just talking about Dr. Bennett 's researches in the nebula of  --  What was it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andromeda . He 's going to prove Einstein 's theories of light are all wrong . CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS Moving about and shaking hands with them . Evening  --  evening  --  They return his greetings . The physicists of the world are sitting on edge , I hear . Con  --  gratulations . GEORGE LINDSAY BENNETT With a graceful wave of his hand . Here 's the man to be congratulated . He touches the shoulder of the sturdy down  --  gazing DR . COLEMAN . CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS Yes , Dr. Coleman . I see your new book has reached the hundred thousand mark . COLEMAN nods . And from the others come several ad lib expressions of " Great . Good for you , Coleman . He 'll be in the millionaire class yet  --  along with Mr. Carter . " I remember the Times gave you front page . Uhm  --  all very good advertising for the university . p. 89 GEORGE LINDSAY BENNETT With his bored generosity . But speaking of advertisement for the university  --  wait until Winford 's new experiment in the musical nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS What  --  another new one ! You 're always in the forefront , Winford . What is it ? EDGAR BELVIDERE WINFORD A trifle  --  only a trifle  --  GEORGE LINDSAY BENNETT He 's too modest . EDGAR BELVIDERE WINFORD Not at all  --  SAMUEL POWERS EVERETT Crisply . And the experiment is costing the uni  --  versity a hundred thousand dollars , I hear . EDGAR BELVIDERE WINFORD I secured the money from a certain foundation , Dr. Everett . DR . LAWRENCE Enviously . A hundred thousand dollars . Think how much Shakespeareana that would buy . EDGAR BELVIDERE WINFORD Changing the subject . We missed you at the Rotary banquet , Dean Williams . The speeches were excel  --  lent . DR . LAWRENCE So was the wine . p. 90 CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS I had some rather important correspondence to attend to . I 'm sure you represented us adequately . And may I repeat that one of the matters of pride to us is the fine relationship that exists between the faculty and the town . Be seated , gentlemen . They all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk , picks up some papers and stands look  --  ing out at them an instant and then continues . As faculty committee on student rules and regulations , gentlemen , you have been asked to meet here for a brief moment to con  --  sider the case of one of our students  --  Henry Pratt . The president has asked on three separate occasions that the student council discipline him for his flagrant behavior at the Thanksgiving football game , but nothing has been done . Our cordial relations with Mr. Carter are in danger of being jeopardized , and that would be  --  well , something of a ca  --  lamity . The gentlemen nod their heads in firm approval . Accordingly it now devolves upon us to punish Mr. Pratt and at the same time require of Mr. William Parker as head of the student council some explanation for his lack of action in the matter . What is your pleasure , gentlemen ? He sits down . DR . WALTON , the biologist , comes in at the right front . He is a stout middle  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick mane  --  like hair and the phlegmy deep voice of a consistent drinker. p. 91 HUGH CAMERON WALTON Evening , gentlemen . They return his greetings , and he sits down . Sorry to be late but I was in the midst of a most exciting exploration . Remember the body of a criminal which was delivered to our department some time ago ? Well , we have just dissected from it a dibothrocephalus latus thirty feet , six and three quarter inches long . In other words a tapeworm . A record in biological annals . SAMUEL POWERS EVERETT No wonder the poor fellow was a criminal . HUGH CAMERON WALTON You 're right there , Dr. Everett , though a dose of your idealistic philosophy administered in time might have saved him . Kindly as he turns and shakes hands with the little man . I 'm joking . How are you , Dr. Everett ? SAMUEL POWERS EVERETT Fine , thank you . HUGH CAMERON WALTON Looking about him . Well , gentlemen , we seem to have enough authority here to impeach the supreme court . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILLIAMS We were just beginning . Have you any sugges  --  tions to make ? HUGH CAMERON WALTON I suppose we 'll have to expel him . However , per  --  sonally I sort of like the cuss . I find his antics rather amus  --  ing . You should too , Winford . His behavior exactly fits your theory of the active unhibited individual . p. 92 EDGAR BELVIDERE WINFORD Gravely . You 're in error there , Dr. Walton . His antics as you call them flow from a diseased personality . He has a deep  --  seated psychosis of inferiority and is simply trying to attract attention to himself . HUGH CAMERON WALTON Well , you should know . That 's your field . You say in your letter , Dean Williams , that the student council has turned Pratt over to us . Why ? DR . LAWRENCE That 's what I want to know . There 's some  --  thing fishy about the whole thing . They 've expelled plenty of students for less infringement of rules than Pratt 's . And speaking of fish  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wil  --  liams , how it is that Johnny Meacham was allowed to trans  --  fer himself from my Shakespeare class to another . CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS It was a routine action , Dr. Lawrence . We ca n't go into that now , if you do n't mind . DR . LAWRENCE A pity , for he had begun to do such good work with his themes . I was planning to excuse him from all his quizzes . CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS Uhm  --  EDGAR BELVIDERE WINFORD Looking at his watch . Well , gentlemen , to come straight to the point and save time , I move that Henry Pratt be expelled . p. 93 DR . LAWRENCE Second the motion . CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS All in favor  --  raise their right hands . They all do so . I do declare that Henry Pratt is expelled from this institution and shall give up immediately all student rights and privileges . I will have the secretary notify him by regis  --  tered letter early tomorrow morning . HUGH CAMERON WALTON And for tactful reasons , if I may say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his labor activities or to Mr. Carter . It might possibly lead to embarrassment . CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS The cause is simply that of drunkenness . They nod their heads in agreement . And now it devolves upon us to find out why the student council has been so remiss in its duty . I have summoned Mr. William Parker here to explain . The door at the right front opens and a little gray  --  haired toil  --  worn woman enters . She is dressed in dowdy clothes and an ill  --  fitting hat . She stops just inside the door and looks around her with dim blinking eyes . WILLIAMS rises . I 'm sorry , madam , you must be in the wrong place . WOMAN In a gentle small voice . No sir , I 'm not . You 're Dean Williams , ai n't you ? I saw you on the platform last commencement when you read out all the names . I 'm Henry Pratt 's mother , and I had to come to see you . Henry said his case would come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seemed like I could n't stand it  --  I had to come up here and see you  --  WALTON gets up suddenly and offers her his chair , taking his seat over across from her . She stands by the chair , one of her toil  --  worn hands gripping and ungripping the rounded knob. p. 94 CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS We understand your interest , madam , and sym  --  pathize with you . Let me assure you that  --  MRS . PRATT You gentlemen will excuse me for breaking in on you like this . I tried to see Dr. Jarvis but he is away on a speaking tour , and I had to come to you . Dean Williams , you ca n't turn my boy out , you ca n't . What he did was sort of prankish  --  you know how young people are some  --  times . Course I do n't say he oughter done it , but he 's prom  --  ised me he 'll behave after this . It 's only a few weeks till commencement , and then he 'll graduate  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't imagine what a struggle it 's been for me to send him here . All these years I 've worked and saved and just about worn my fingers to the bone to pay for his schooling . He 's worked too , ever since he was a little boy , and there 's a high school that would give him a job teaching Latin if he gets his diploma . Course it wo n't pay much but it will help us live and he will be able to give me something . I 'm getting about where I ca n't work much more . My eyes are dimming down and I do n't see the threads the way I useter . Henry never intended to go in for Latin , but Dr. Armstrong said there was a big opening in that field and advised him to take it as a freshman . And he 's worked real hard at it ever since and made good grades . Promise me you 'll keep him on till commencement . She stops and stares at the men . WALTON clears his throat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindly but non  --  committal voice . I regret exceedingly , Mrs. Pratt , that your son has brought this trouble on you . His case is receiving every consideration . MRS . PRATT I know you have to look after the students and see that they do n't break the rules . But you wo n't expel him , will you ? Just talk to him and make him see the need to keep quiet and go on with his work . It 's not really his fault about the trouble down in the mill village . He at  --  tends these organizers ' meetings and listens to the talk , and feels called on to take a hand . You know he worked in them cotton mills as a child . His father was in them before him . He always wanted an education himself  --  his father , I mean  --  but never had any chance . We always dreamed that our son would have the chance we never had , and we sent him here . Then my husband died , and I tried to carry the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williams , let him stay . CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS I am sure we are all acting for the best interests of both your son and the university , Mrs. Pratt . MRS . PRATT I tried to get to Mr. Carter  --  Mr. Carter would n't turn him out  --  I do n't believe he would , not if I could tell him everything . We used to know each other , played together as children  --  Mr. Carter , I mean . Then he grew to be a great man  --  and I  --  I never amounted to any  --  thing . But he would remember , he would . But I could n't see him . It gets harder and harder for the workers to get at him . He has all kinds of assistants and secretaries and they 're all nice as can be . They take down what you tell them , but nothing ever happens about it . Her voice trem  --  bling . I beg you  --  I  --  WILLIAMS comes over and stands by her. p. 96 CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS Still with a gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know nothing about that , Mrs. Pratt . MRS . PRATT I 'm sorry to have to come to you this way . You are all so busy , have so many great things in your mind to worry you  --  I ought not to bother you with my troubles . But you  --  you know how it is with a mother  --  In the Bible it says  --  CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS Yes , we know . MRS . PRATT If you turn him out I do n't know what he might do . He 's so headstrong at times . He might  --  he might do something desperate . He 's always counted so much on getting his diploma . DR . LAWRENCE Breaking in testily . Then he should have be  --  haved himself . MRS . PRATT I know  --  I know . I 've begged him on my knees to stay out of trouble , but he ca n't . He says he has to stand up and speak against  --  CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS We appreciate your problem , Mrs. Pratt-very deeply . And thank you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room , closes the door after her and then turns back to the committee . I regret this unforeseen interruption , gentlemen . p. 97 HUGH CAMERON WALTON Well , I feel sorry for that woman , I tell you . CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS Still I do n't see how we can reconsider our vote , Dr. Walton . HUGH CAMERON WALTON No  --  perhaps not . He stares off , puffing his cigar thoughtfully . SAMUEL POWERS EVERETT No . As a student at this institution her son had certain rules to obey . He violated them . Therefore he must be punished and the verdict stands . The matter is one of logic , not sentiment . HUGH CAMERON WALTON Drily . That 's right , I forgot your logic , Dr. Everett . CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS Shall we proceed ? Several of the committee nod , and he goes over to the door at the left rear . Opening the door he calls out . Come in , Mr. Parker . PARKER comes in and at a gesture from WILLIAMS takes his seat in an empty chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quiet  --  mannered as before , though there is a sense of nervousness in his rather tight lips and restless hands . WILLIAMS closes the door and returns to his position behind the desk . He speaks in a kind businesslike voice . Mr. Parker , it is with some reluctance that we have felt it necessary to have you appear before us . Your record here as a student and campus leader is of high standing and only the seriousness of the matter has constrained us to take this action . Parker says nothing but sits staring before him . Dr. Walton , as chairman of our committee , will you please begin the questions ? p. 98 HUGH CAMERON WALTON Mr. Parker , as head of the student council you have put this group as well as the university in an embarrassing situation . BILLY PARKER I 'm sorry , sir . HUGH CAMERON WALTON This is a democratic institution , and long ago its founder  --  With a look at the portrait in the rear  --  decided that the student body should be self  --  governing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representatives should have control over the discipline and morale of the student body , only in extreme cases calling upon the faculty committee . Well , it seems that we have a most extreme case before us , for apparently Henry Pratt is an exception to all rules . Early in the year he got into a fight down in the mill town and would have gone to jail , I understand , except for your interference . Next he wrote an article attacking the capitalistic set  --  up in this country with especial reference to one of our alumni which you published in the university magazine . Then some months ago he openly committed an extreme breach of discipline which by the rules stated in the catalogue should have been handled by your council and that without delay . The first two actions we will let pass , but the last we can not . Will you please tell us why the student council refused to discipline or expel Henry Pratt ? p. 99 BILLY PARKER Evasively . Perhaps all of us do n't feel that he should be expelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He got drunk and made a public spectacle of himself . BILLY PARKER He did n't get drunk , sir , at least I do n't think he did . HUGH CAMERON WALTON If he was n't drunk how do you explain his behavior ? WILLIAMS presses a button and the SECRETARY comes in . CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS Will you make notes of this meeting , please ? I shall need them for the president . The SECRETARY sits down in the left rear corner with her pencil and pad . Go ahead , Dr. Walton . HUGH CAMERON WALTON Will you please answer my question ? BILLY PARKER Henry Pratt did what he thought was right , Dr. Walton . HUGH CAMERON WALTON And do you think it was right ? BILLY PARKER Lifting his eyes . At first , I did n't think so , and then finally I began to appreciate his point of view . SAMUEL POWERS EVERETT What point of view , Mr. Parker ? p. 100 BILLY PARKER Well , he felt it his duty to defend the cause of labor . Dr. Coleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right of collective bargaining and free speech . And one day I remember he said the worker should share in the profits of his labor . Is n't that right , Dr. Coleman ? But Dr. Coleman stares ahead of him without making any answer . HUGH CAMERON WALTON The problems of capital and labor are not for us to decide . But it is our duty to protect the best interests of the university , and you as a student in a position of trust and about to graduate should feel the same duty . PARKER is silent . SAMUEL POWERS EVERETT As you know , Mr. Parker , Mr. Carter is a business man . The institution which he serves is the institution known as business . He must obey the laws that control that business  --  in this case economic laws . They control him as well as the workers . That is the logic of it . BILLY PARKER Looking up again . But this same logic does n't help Henry Pratt , sir . Here he went and did what he believed in  --  protested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and now the university plans to kick him out . Is it right for them to expel him for doing what he thought was right ? p. 101 SAMUEL POWERS EVERETT In this case , yes , for his theory was wrong  --  illogical . BILLY PARKER With a show of feeling . Why , Dr. Everett , you have taught us in ethics that a man should stand up and speak for the right as he sees it . You 're always talking about how Spinoza stood in the synagogue  --  how Martin Luther  --  I 'm sorry , sir . SAMUEL POWERS EVERETT The cases are entirely different . BILLY PARKER I do n't see it . HUGH CAMERON WALTON At this time we are not exactly trying to find out whether Mr. Pratt was logical or illogical but rather why the student council headed by you refused to discipline said Pratt . Will you please answer that question , Mr. Parker ? PARKER is silent . You are making it hard for us . BILLY PARKER I 'm sorry , sir . HUGH CAMERON WALTON You realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your honor ? BILLY PARKER Yes , sir , and ought n't that to apply to the professors , too ? HUGH CAMERON WALTON Staring at him . What do you mean by that ? BILLY PARKER The whole thing is all mixed . up , Dr. Walton , and whatever blame there is is due to me , I guess . Nobody else is concerned . p. 102 SAMUEL POWERS EVERETT We 're all concerned . If the council is morally lax then we must know it . The welfare of the university demands it . BILLY PARKER I alone wanted Henry Pratt to remain in school . The other council members wanted him expelled . HUGH CAMERON WALTON Then why did n't they out  --  vote you ? PARKER is again silent . EDGAR BELVIDERE WINFORD Looking at PARKER . What is this strange fascination Mr. Pratt has for you , Mr. Parker ? BILLY PARKER I  --  I do n't understand , sir . EDGAR BELVIDERE WINFORD I am speaking psychologically  --  or perhaps pathologically . When two young men  --  HUGH CAMERON WALTON Come now , Winford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't answer us we shall be forced to take action as regards you . PARKER sits staring at the floor . The door at the right front opens and HENRY PRATT stands looking in at them . HENRY PRATT I 'll answer for him . The men all turn around in their seats. p. 103 CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS In a cold polite voice . Mr. Pratt , I must ask you not to disturb us . HUGH CAMERON WALTON We excuse you , Mr. Pratt . HENRY PRATT Looking from one to the other , his face pale and twitching . Well , from the looks of your faces I guess my goose is already cooked as the gander said . But I wo n't stand out there and let you pile on Park . BILLY PARKER Go along , Henry . HENRY PRATT Closing the door behind him , his back to it . Oh no , I 'm going to say something . So let 's start at the beginning , and everything . begins with Mr. Carter . CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS Will you please leave Mr. Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all goes back to him anyhow  --  to the great millionaire who controls this university like a man with a puppet show . It 's because of him that you want to expel me , for instance . Maybe you already have . Have you ? CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS You will be notified of our action at the proper time . HENRY PRATT Suddenly shaking himself and pulling up his gaunt shoulders . Never mind that . I wo n't beg . But if you , do expel me I 'll know then how much lies and mockery and injustice this place breeds . If you turn me out because I stood up and spoke for the common man  --  p. 104 CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS The only charge against you is one of drunkenness . HENRY PRATT So you hide behind that blind ? BILLY PARKER Shut up , Henry . HENRY PRATT No , I 'm going to have my say . And if I was to be commencement speaker like you I 'd stand up in Memorial Hall and tell ' em the truth . No , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's my friend , he 's stuck by me , and I wo n't let you pile in on him . He 'd let you roast his tongue out before he 'd squeal on the fellows . Well , I 'll squeal . I got no honor-not that kind . Oh , you need n't think the student council was n't going to get my hide all right . But I come in on the whole gang of them writing up Johnny Meacham 's themes for him and trying to cheat him by old Doc Lawrence 's Shakespeare . And other things  --  I know too much . DR . LAWRENCE Now we 're getting somewhere . HENRY PRATT And because they knew I 'd spill the beans and blow the lid off they decided to let me stay if I would n't squeal on ' em . CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS Swallowing heavily . Your mere word that the council was cheating would n't have proved anything-with all due respect to your reputation . HENRY PRATT Well , that 's the truth anyway . p. 105 BILLY PARKER Not quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to expel Mr. Pratt was that I made a deal with them not to . HENRY PRATT Aw , cut it , Park . BILLY PARKER As PRATT sits down and bows his head over in his hands . Johnny Meacham could n't pass his Shakespeare quiz , and we faked an injured knee and put him in the infirmary . It was my suggestion  --  with the understanding they 'd let Pratt stay in school if I got Meacham by . DR . LAWRENCE With a squeal . Well , I 'll be  --  CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS With grave face . Gentlemen , this is unbelievable . HENRY PRATT It 's true , all right . SAMUEL POWERS EVERETT If it is , then we must purge the whole student council . HENRY PRATT Looking up quickly . Yeh , and you better purge the professors and the alumni . CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS To think this has been going on behind our backs  --  and the high moral standing of this institution has been its watchword . In his agitation he rises and begins pacing the room . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ca n't prove it . p. 106 HENRY PRATT Spitefully . And that ai n't the half of it . There 's plenty of corruption at this place .  --  And the boys are on to it . SAMUEL POWERS EVERETT I move that we summon all the members of the council before us . HENRY PRATT As the men remain silent . You 'd better not . They know too much about what goes on behind the scenes . They know for instance just as well as you do that Mr. Carter on the side pays Johnny Meacham two thousand dollars a year to play football here . Item number one  --  CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS That 's enough , Mr. Pratt . Get out . HENRY PRATT Oh , it 's hidden under the shape of scholarships and bonuses handed to him in the dark , but the boys know about it . They keep their mouths shut  --  oh , yes  --  for they 're growing up to be loyal alumni . I tell you you better let things be quiet . Yeh , they know that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and publish it as their own and get paid for it  --  I could name ' em  --  Item number two . They know that at least two heads of departments here get big retaining fees from certain crooked corporations  --  Item number three  --  HUGH CAMERON WALTON Rising . Mr. Pratt , we ask you to leave the room . He stares at him sternly . Leave the room , will you ? p. 107 BILLY PARKER Go along , Henry . HENRY PRATT All right , I 'm going . But you better not bother Billy Parker . And if I 'm allowed to graduate I 'll never put foot in another man 's university , so help me God . No , I 'll take to the open road as Walt Whitman says . Yeh , I 'll sell fruit trees or can openers  --  become a cow doctor  --  do something useful . He goes out at the right , slamming the door behind him . DR . LAWRENCE Mopping his forehead . Well , no matter what else Mr. Carter does he certainly breeds up vivid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his chair and stares off before him . HUGH CAMERON WALTON Turning furiously upon PARKER . This is a nice mess you 've got us into , Mr. Parker . BILLY PARKER Gazing at him and stammering . I 'm  --  I 'm sorry , sir . HUGH CAMERON WALTON Roaring . You 're sorry  --  " sorry , sir . " What the hell good does that do ! BILLY PARKER His face cold and set . I 'm ready to resign from the council whenever you say . p. 108 CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS Snapping as he rises from his chair again . And cause a scandal of nation  --  wide proportions to disgrace this university . He begins pacing up and down the room . For a moment they all are silent . Finally they begin to look towards WILLIAMS . DR . LAWRENCE It seems we have stirred up more snakes than we can kill , as the saying is . SAMUEL POWERS EVERETT However , we must pursue the matter to its logical conclusion and clean up this situation . HUGH CAMERON WALTON Yes , liquidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not good sense . GEORGE LINDSAY BENNETT Softly and gently as always . I hardly see how we can  --  er  --  clean it up . The ramifications are infinite , speaking mathematically . DR . LAWRENCE Yeh  --  on the one hand this Pratt ought to be expelled , but we ca n't do it for fear of a scandal . On the other hand the student council ought to be purged , but we ca n't do that for fear of a worse scandal . CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS The best thing to do is to do nothing . Coldly . And we have you to thank , Mr. Parker , for this impasse . p. 109 BILLY PARKER Controlling the tremor in his voice . I do n't think that 's fair , sir , I do n't . Maybe I made a mistake , but I wanted to save Henry Pratt . HUGH CAMERON WALTON Apparently you have saved him for our hands are tied . SAMUEL POWERS EVERETT In his clean close  --  clipped phrases . So you 're afraid of Henry Pratt , are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stink , are you ? CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS Gentlemen , in view of the development I move we forget the whole matter . SAMUEL POWERS EVERETT I object . CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS And ask Mr. Parker on his honor to continue as a loyal student . As for Mr. Pratt , I shall be glad to admonish him to be more tactful in his public appearance , and accordingly we can cancel our previous vote . HUGH CAMERON WALTON Second the motion . CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS Those in favor  --  Everyone raises his hand except DR . EVERETT and PARKER . Motion carried . To the SECRETARY . You can tear up those notes . Mr. Pratt will remain in school . The SECRETARY does so with a ripping sound. p. 110 SAMUEL POWERS EVERETT Rising , his voice trembling . Gentlemen , I can not countenance such action . What are we coming to-what are we coming to ? Consider me no longer a member of this council  --  excuse me  --  excuse me . He makes his way to the door at the right front and goes out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SECRETARY goes out at the left rear . GEORGE LINDSAY BENNETT And now I am inclined to ask how the university will explain its action to Mr. Carter . HUGH CAMERON WALTON In view of Mr. Pratt 's disclosure it ought not to be hard to explain . CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS I shall take it upon myself personally to visit Mr. Carter and have a talk with him . HUGH CAMERON WALTON That will have to do . Good night , gentlemen . He goes out at the right front . OTHERS With the exception of the DEAN and WINFORD , going out likewise . Good night . CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS Good night . Thank you for coming . Starting towards the door at the left rear . Good night , Dr. Winford  --  or are you coming my way ? p. 111 EDGAR BELVIDERE WINFORD I have to go across to the laboratory . Good night . CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS The janitor will close up . Looking at PARKER . I do n't mind saying before Dr. Winford , Mr. Parker , that after your behavior in this matter I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on commencement day and speak for your fellow students . He takes his hat and overcoat from a rack in the corner and goes out . WINFORD and PARKER are left alone , PARKER still sitting in his chair . EDGAR BELVIDERE WINFORD Well , Mr. Parker , I would n't let it bother me much . These little situations arise now and then . BILLY PARKER Evidently it 's not a little thing . EDGAR BELVIDERE WINFORD The committee handled it very tactfully . No one will be the wiser . BILLY PARKER But why did n't they stand up for what they believed in  --  the truth or whatever it is ? EDGAR BELVIDERE WINFORD Truth is a complicated subject . Mr. Parker , I have long wanted to talk with you . I think I could help you in your worry . BILLY PARKER No , I guess I 'll have to think things out for myself . p. 112 EDGAR BELVIDERE WINFORD But from my casual observation you are not thinking things out  --  you 're going round and round in them like an untrained rat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round all right . I ca n't make heads or tails out of things any more . EDGAR BELVIDERE WINFORD Most sensitive people pass through these periods of questioning and doubt , though you seem to be a little worse than most . The simple truth is you are growing up . You are passing into manhood and are awakening to the difficulties and seeming contradictions of life . I need to have a number of conversations with you to diagnose you adequately , but right off I should say your trouble is mainly functional . UNCLE BENNY comes in at the right rear with a mop and broom . UNCLE BENNY Excuse me , gentlemen , if I tidy up a bit . EDGAR BELVIDERE WINFORD Go right ahead . Uncle Benny puts his mop and broom down , takes up a wastebasket and starts out the way he came . The phone rings on the desk . He turns and awkwardly picks up the receiver . UNCLE BENNY Speaking to the phone as if it were a man . Hello  --  what ?  --  Yes , ma'am  --  Laying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He goes out with the basket . WINFORD goes to the phone. p. 113 EDGAR BELVIDERE WINFORD Picking it up . Yes .  --  A look of pleasure running over his face.  --  Oh , yes , Miss Jarvis  --  In a moment . PARKER looks up . Go right ahead with the alpha reactions , I 'll be over in a moment . I 'm talking to Mr. Parker . Yes , Mr. Parker . No , no thanks , I do n't need you . He slowly hangs up the receiver . She 's a wonderful girl- Starting and turning around.  --  er  --  a wonderful scientist  --  PARKER bows his head . As I was saying , your trouble is functional . You have met with certain difficulties  --  in understanding things  --  in getting at what you call the truth . You have been rebuffed by the difficulty . This has made you draw back hurt as it were , caused you to develop this recent habit of solitude , solitary thinking . This has in turn led to concentration on yourself . This consideration of oneself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inverted worship of oneself , if continued will lead to megalomania or over  --  exaggeration of one 's own importance and that in turn again to loneliness and finally despair . Miss Jarvis reports to me  --  BILLY PARKER She does , eh ? EDGAR BELVIDERE WINFORD  --  That you are worried about such problems as God , immortality , man 's destiny . That 's natural but have you ever thought that the reason that men continue to believe in such ideas is simply that they have a fixation on their own egotism ? Is n't it curious that the great religious leaders have always been lonely solitary men ? p. 114 BILLY PARKER You mean such men as Jesus , Confucius and Buddha were egotists ? EDGAR BELVIDERE WINFORD Yes , frustrated ones . BILLY PARKER Well , if you put me in a class with Jesus , I ought not to worry about that . EDGAR BELVIDERE WINFORD You should worry even the more . Crucifixion is no way for a decent man to end his life . BILLY PARKER But this has nothing to do with Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is directly connected . If you had not been in such a confused condition you would have clearly seen the issues involved and acted accordingly . BILLY PARKER Throwing out his hands wearily . All right , Dr. Winford , you win . EDGAR BELVIDERE WINFORD It 's not a question of my winning , Mr. Parker , but of helping you to a healthy normal view of things . I could do that . You 've got a splendid mind  --  I hate to see it going to waste . Tell me , do you ever have the impulse to anger ? BILLY PARKER Looking up at him . No , not exactly  --  er  --  per haps so . EDGAR BELVIDERE WINFORD Sometimes that 's not bad for a fellow  --  if he can get rip  --  roaring mad at something  --  blow off steam . To my mind the most normal spot in the life of Jesus was when he used the whip . p. 115 BILLY PARKER Thoughtfully . Yes sir , but what about the fellows he used it on ? EDGAR BELVIDERE WINFORD Perhaps they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RACHEL comes in . WINFORD looks around in astonishment , and PARKER slowly gets up . Why , Miss Jarvis , I thought  --  RACHEL JARVIS It 's only a step across here and when you said you were talking to Billy I thought I might run over and help you  --  I  --  EDGAR BELVIDERE WINFORD Coldly . No , Miss Jarvis , we were only having a casual conversation . Good night , Mr. Parker . And any time you feel moved to do so , I shall be glad to have you come to my office . The door is open . Come , Miss Jarvis . RACHEL JARVIS Billy , you look so  --  er  --  BILLY PARKER You and the doctor go on and play with your roosters and pigs and salivary glands , and do n't worry about me . RACHEL JARVIS Why , that 's downright impolite to Dr. Winford , Billy . BILLY PARKER I mean it to be . As RACHEL starts to speak . Yeh , I 'm beginning to see a few things , I am . All this talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future ahead for you . I guess it 's nothing but scientific interest that makes him take you around to ball games and walks on Sunday . p. 116 RACHEL JARVIS Billy ! BILLY PARKER The hell it is ! EDGAR BELVIDERE WINFORD Miss Jarvis , we must go . Come . BILLY PARKER The master 's voice . All right , good-bye , Rachel , and do n't let your mother 's heart grieve after me . He turns and begins to walk back and forth in the room . RACHEL takes a step toward him , but WINFORD reaches out and takes her arm . She turns and stares up in his face a moment , and then pulls her arm from him . RACHEL JARVIS I 'm sorry , Dr. Winford . She looks back at PARKER an instant and then goes out , followed by WINFORD . UNCLE BENNY enters from the right rear . UNCLE BENNY Setting the basket down . Have a good meeting , Mr. Parker ? BILLY PARKER Wonderful . The old man turns and raises one of the windows at the rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sharp clink of hammers on stone come into the room . UNCLE BENNY stares upward and out of the window . UNCLE BENNY Purty sight  --  them stars out there  --  look like flowers of light  --  hum  --  yes they do  --  shining in a great field . Purty. p. 117 BILLY PARKER I used to think so . UNCLE BENNY Hum  --  And look at the new Carter bell tower  --  sure rushing it along with their night work . Hear it 's to be seventy feet higher than any other in the country . BILLY PARKER Stopping his pacing and looking over at the old man . Uncle Benny  --  UNCLE BENNY Turning back into the room . Yes , sir . BILLY PARKER You find the world a wonderful place to live in , do n't you ? UNCLE BENNY Sure . BILLY PARKER Why ? UNCLE BENNY Staring at him . Well , I never thought much about it  --  I just do . Reckon it 's because I 've got my health and a good job . Of course , it may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it do to me . Every bit of dust I sweep up or trash I clean away makes me feel I 'm helping along in the great cause . BILLY PARKER What cause ? UNCLE BENNY Why , the university  --  education . A man 's got to have something important in his life  --  something to do , something he can call his'n , his work . Fondling his broom . You know , I plumb love this old broom . And every time I have to get a new one it hurts me , when they wear out I save ' em all  --  put ' em away in the closet like buried soldiers . Yes , sir , I love my brooms , for they 're the heart of my job  --  if you know what I mean . p. 118 BILLY PARKER I heard another fellow talking the same way . A man 's got to have a job he said to be a man . UNCLE BENNY You 're feeling kinder downcast , ai n't you , Mr. Parker ? BILLY PARKER Oh  --  I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't hurry the sun , for it wo n't come up till it 's ready . BILLY PARKER What do you mean ? UNCLE BENNY You seem to be pushing against the collar too much since I 've been noticing you around here  --  in your mind , I mean . Well , that 's natural to an ambitious boy . You 're a senior , ai n't you ? BILLY PARKER Yes . UNCLE BENNY And you ain't. decided what you plan to do out in the world . BILLY PARKER Not yet . I once thought I 'd like to teach in a university but I 've given that up . UNCLE BENNY Well , you 'll find your calling . That 's the reason for most of your worry . And of course the girl business too , but that 'll straighten out . It always does . Excuse me . He gathers up the inkwells and pencils from the desk . JAMES MITCHELL enters at the left rear . He is all dressed up  --  hat , gloves , white silk muffler and light overcoat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech he shows he 's had enough liquor to feel larkish. p. 119 JAMES MITCHELL Evening , everybody . As UNCLE BENNY starts by him . Pardon me , sir . UNCLE BENNY Hah  --  hah  --  Feeling good , Mr. Mitchell ? JAMES MITCHELL Giving his hat a twirl . Feeling good , sir . Spring , you know , balmy spring coming on , sap rising in Vermont  --  As if quoting . The icy chains of winter now dissolve . Apostrophizing . O thou great mother earth  --  teeming with rich fruitfulness . UNCLE BENNY That 's right  --  robins all in my garden , hundreds of ' em . Me and my wife gon na plant potatoes tomorrow . Giving him a quick look out of his rheumy eyes . Hah  --  hah . He goes on out at the left rear . BILLY PARKER What 's all the get-up for ? JAMES MITCHELL The party  --  the one I promised you  --  it 's on . I 've been hunting for you everywhere . He gestures magnanimously with his cane . Where 's your hat ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes in again at the right front . MITCHELL looks around angrily . What the hell you doing here ? p. 120 RACHEL JARVIS Billy , please come on down to the laboratory . Dr. Winford really wants to talk to you . He understands you  --  he does  --  BILLY PARKER He wants to talk , hah ? RACHEL JARVIS Please do  --  come on now . JAMES MITCHELL Ca n't be did . He has another date . RACHEL JARVIS But  --  JAMES MITCHELL She says " but , " but little Louise can say it better . RACHEL JARVIS Are you going  --  Incredulously . You must n't , Billy  --  you mus n't go down there . JAMES MITCHELL Away the old morality  --  step forth  --  uninhibited  --  a free world . Come on , Park . BILLY PARKER Yeh , a free nature  --  be active  --  RACHEL JARVIS Her eyes flashing . Do n't take him , Mitch , you  --  She clutches PARKER by the arm . BILLY PARKER Bursting out and flinging off her hand . He 's not taking me anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertain old Winford , he 's lonely without you . Got any liquor , Mitch ? p. 121 JAMES MITCHELL A quart of Paul Jones . BILLY PARKER Come on ! Now grabbing MITCHELL by the arm he hurries away at right front . RACHEL JARVIS Calling . Billy ! She stands looking helplessly after them , and then sits down in a chair . UNCLE BENNY comes back and begins arranging the desk again . He looks queryingly over at RACHEL once or twice as he works . The telephone rings and he awkwardly picks up the receiver as before . UNCLE BENNY Heigh . After listening a moment . Dr. Winford asks if you are here . As RACHEL is silent . Yessir . Again listening . He wants you to come over . RACHEL JARVIS In a muffled voice . I 'm not coming . She bows her head over and bursts into tears . UNCLE BENNY To the phone . No sir  --  nobody 's crying ! Oh , she 's laughing  --  er  --  yessir , she 's fine . He lays the receiver back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes  --  I  --  er  --  Gazing kindly over at RACHEL 'S bowed head. @x THE bell begins to ring and as it dies , the glee  --  club chorus is heard singing " Lord Geoffrey Amherst was a soldier of the King . " It stops , and the light comes up on the scene transformed into a setting in Night  --  Town . At the right is the shadowy outline of a frame house with steps leading up to a door in the center . A few bits of shrubbery are before it , with a bench and more , shrubbery at the left . The scene is almost dark , shadowy , and each object is seen somewhat foggy in outline . The dull light from a street lamp off at the left illuminates the front of the house with a nebulous glow . MISS MARY , a voluptuous , kindly middle  --  aged woman , is standing in the door of the house , looking out . A stout good  --  natured POLICEMAN of about fifty is standing on the sidewalk chatting with her . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if to remind both MISS MARY and himself not to forget that he is a guardian of the law . POLICEMAN Continuing with a chuckle . Yes , I should say your business ought to be better now with spring coming on . MISS MARY My business is always good . POLICEMAN With abrupt kindness . Look here , Mary , I like you . I always keep my eye turned the other way , you know that . But after all this is a  --  well , this is a sorter shady business for a woman like you to be in . Shaking his head . No , I ca n't understand it . At heart you 're okay . Look at the work you do for the poor folks in the mill . But golly , how you keep fooling around with these college students the way you do  --  ! p. 123 MISS MARY It 's the college students that keep fooling around with me . POLICEMAN Hmn  --  just boys , hardly weaned from their mothers . MISS MARY With a touch of feeling . And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mother ' em  --  in a way I do . Of course they 're fiery little pigs , rooting for the secrets of life , thinking they 've got all the manhood of old King David , and curious , curious , that 's it . All r'aring to go The sprinkly chatter of women 's voices , followed by the husky far  --  away laughter of men in the depths of the house , interrupts her for a moment . As it dies away she goes on . Well , I believe I 'm the one to teach ' em . As the POLICEMAN shakes his shoulders . Do n't I keep a healthy place , run according to decency and medical standards ? Sure I do . POLICEMAN Yeh , that might be so , but  --  it 's the principle of the thing , as you might say . MISS MARY And do n't I listen to their troubles , sympathize with ' em ? And besides , I initiate them into the  --  well  --  the mystery of sex . POLICEMAN Gruffly . And take their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say I was a teacher ? And had n't a teacher ought to get paid ? You think the professors up there at the university work for no salary ? Not on your life ! Yes , that 's what I am , a teacher . A sort of sex professor . And you listen to me , Bob . You ought to know . They ai n't nothing more important than sex , is they ? Anyhow mighty few things , you can bet your britches on that . Well , the boys learn about that here in my house . They 've got a course in marriage up there at the university , but they got no laboratory with it . Well , I sort of run the laboratory end . Chuckling again as her voice rolls on . If you want to know the truth  --  I count myself just as important in the university life , say , as President Jarvis or any of them . In fact they ought to list my course in the catalogue up there ' cause plenty of ' em take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POLICEMAN Laughing vapidly . Ha-ha-ha , then how about me enrolling on the side ? MISS MARY Get on , get on  --  and you with eight children . If you ai n't already educated it 's too late to start on you now . A tall burly young fellow , with his overcoat collar turned up and his hat pulled down over his forehead , comes out of the door by her . YOUNG MAN Excuse me. p. 125 MISS MARY Good night , Mr. Banks . YOUNG MAN Turning rapidly into the darkness at the right . Good night . POLICEMAN Staring after him . Mr. Banks , eh ? If that ai n't Johnny Meacham , the great football player , I 'll eat my hat ! MISS MARY Calling back into the house . Bring me my coat , Louise ! POLICEMAN Hum  --  well , no matter . Turning back . Do n't guess any of the professors ever study under you , do they ? MISS MARY The married ones do n't need it and the single ones ai n't able to stand it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something to men  --  seems to work on their  --  Laughing.  --  hardihood . Two weeks ago though , we had one of them down here . A fellow named Winford  --  a Dr. Winford . POLICEMAN Why I bet he 's the fellow writes so much in the papers  --  psychology or something , and how to banish fear . MISS MARY Yeah , psychology . And that 's what he was down for , not for fun . He had a college girl with him , a pretty thing she was . I could have used her . p. 126 POLICEMAN Instinctively twirling his club . Nunh-unh , now . No fooling with innocent girls , you know . I 'd have to  --  MISS MARY Innocent  --  says you ! Wait till you see the doings around some of these college dances . POLICEMAN Hm-nm , I know a place over by the rock quarry where  --  But never mind . And what 'd the professor want ? MISS MARY Oh , to talk with all the girls and ask ' em a lot of questions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . I co-operate with the university in every way I can . And so he did . And when he got through he said the I.Q. of my girls was better than that of the college girls . POLICEMAN Snickering . The I  --  what ? MISS MARY I.Q. , I said  --  some letters that mean how much sense they got , you old backslider . A girl comes to the door and helps MARY on with her coat . The elder woman buttons it around her and then picks up a covered pail in the hall and comes down into the yard . She calls back to the girl . I 'll be up at the mill all night . When them two boys come  --  you know  --  take care of everything . LOUISE Okay . She stands in the door looking out , and under her cloak we see that she is dressed in a gaudy evening dress with plenty of jewelry , and her corn-colored hair is primped and waved to perfection above her dull but pretty face. p. 127 POLICEMAN Things is bad up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARY Terrible . The governor 's got the militia down and more coming , and they 've even deputized some of the university students to keep order . Again the laughter comes from inside the house , followed by a rough barber-shop quartet singing , " We 're tenting tonight on the old camp ground . " MARY speaks to LOUISE . Go back in there and tell them Y.M.C.A. boys to quiet down . The girl disappears from the door . I 'm helping the Salvation Army run a soup kitchen up there as long as the strike lasts . Sighing and looking off . You would n't think that in a mile of here there 's one of the richest universities in the world ! People studying , figuring , and doing great things for the human race , and yet they ai n't never been able to do a thing for these hundreds of hungry folks right at their doors . POLICEMAN And if these folks 'd go back to work they would n't be hungry . Authoritatively , as his billy turns . Well , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to always have it , so to speak . MISS MARY Old man Carter could do a damn sight better by turning some of his money in their direction . Yeah , the money they worked out for him  --  with spindles and bobbins and spools . They could use a bit to keep body and soul together . But no , he puts up memorial towers and gymnasiums and things like that . p. 128 POLICEMAN Yeh , and he might try giving them mill folks all the millions he 's accumulated and what good would it do ? In a month it 'd all be wasted on instalment buying and things 'd be bad as ever . That 's the principle of it . MISS MARY Well  --  As she starts off at the left and then turns back . I can tell you this  --  when I come up before Saint Peter in heaven and he asks me what I 've done to be there , I 'll tell him what I ai n't done . I 'll tell him I did n't run a factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she hurries away with her pail . The POLICEMAN stares about him a moment , twirls his billy aimlessly and then wanders back and forth across the scene . A moment passes and LOUISE comes idly out through the door and strolls about in the yard . She sits down on the bench by the shrubbery half-hidden in the shadow . A piano begins to tinkle softly in the depths of the house , playing a sentimental love song . LOUISE sighs , pats her hair with jeweled fingers , stretches out her trim feet and inspects them . LOUISE Beginning to sing in a slightly rasping voice . There 's nothing but love I 'm thinking of  --  Nothing but love  --  POLICEMAN Your sweety 's late , ai n't he ? p. 129 LOUISE It was a late date . POLICEMAN Well , do n't make it too late and be sure you keep everything quiet . LOUISE Okay . She gets up and drifts back into the house . Two poorly dressed young fellows , apparently of the factory class , come across the scene from right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only thing to do is fight  --  fight to the end , I say  --  Seeing the POLICEMAN . Ssh  --  POLICEMAN Eyeing them suspiciously . Where you fellows going this time of night ? The second tramp-like figure slows his steps and looks at the POLICEMAN , and we recognize PRATT . HENRY PRATT Sarcastically . And what 's it to you , you majestic dummy ? POLICEMAN Moving sternly over towards him . Now do n't get sassy , or I 'll run you in . HENRY PRATT Not hardly . You 've got your orders to stay here and protect your bawdy house . He and his partner hurry on . POLICEMAN Calling after them . Better stay away from that mill ! Following after them . You might get a bay'net run through you ! p. 130 HENRY PRATT Calling back sardonically . Oh yeah ! POLICEMAN Ai n't you that guy , Henry Pratt ? A raspberry noise comes backward out of the night , and the POLICEMAN goes after it . The piano continues to play . MITCHELL and PARKER come into the scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MITCHELL Slowing up . Well , here we are . BILLY PARKER Stopping and staring around him . Is this Miss Mary 's ? His voice is slightly thick from liquor , though he is not yet drunk . Hello , Miss Mary ! JAMES MITCHELL But not so fast . And say , gim me a last drink of my booze , wo n't you ? PARKER pulls the bottle from his pocket and hands it to him . Cripes , you 've drunk it all . He throws the bottle into the shrubbery . BILLY PARKER Drawing himself up and calling out loudly . Okay , forward march ! JAMES MITCHELL Catching him by the arm . Do n't wake up the neighborhood . BILLY PARKER Pulling loose from him . I wo n't  --  but forward march . Now muttering to himself . That 's what she said . It 's not what you do but how you do it . Be active , be forceful  --  that 's what she said . p. 131 JAMES MITCHELL Who said what ? BILLY PARKER Rachel . That 's her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Say , you 're drunk  --  are you ? BILLY PARKER Hell no ! JAMES MITCHELL Well , you will be . BILLY PARKER Murmuring . She 's a wonderful girl , Mitch . JAMES MITCHELL Oh , sure , she 's wonderful . Looking over towards the house . They 've got some wonderful girls here too , Park . BILLY PARKER Staring at the ground . And she did n't want me to come here . JAMES MITCHELL Now why in the devil did you start thinking of that ? BILLY PARKER She did n't , Mitch . JAMES MITCHELL She was jealous , you fool . BILLY PARKER She 's a wonderful girl but I do n't understand her . You say she was jealous ? JAMES MITCHELL We got no time to go into that now . BILLY PARKER Break through , she said . You 're inhibited , she said . And both the two of you say the same  --  p. 132 JAMES MITCHELL Yeh , and here 's where we 'll get you uninhibited right away . BILLY PARKER Think so ? JAMES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . Slapping him on the back . And do n't slow down , old boy . You 've got the real stuff in you , Park , in spite of that Phi Beta Kappa complex . I knew it all the time  --  All right , let 's go . BILLY PARKER Thanks , Mitch  --  Say  --  give me a sort of hint how to get started  --  Breaking off . You say she was jealous ? JAMES MITCHELL Aw , skip it . Anyway Louise will make you forget it in a minute . BILLY PARKER And now it all comes back to me  --  how beautiful she looked , standing there  --  her eyes flashing , saying , " Do n't do it , Billy . " Want me to tell you something , Mitch ? JAMES MITCHELL Angrily . Shut up , I say . Calling softly . Louise ! BILLY PARKER A kind of thrill went through me  --  an aching thrill , and me feeling I loved her so . But I would n't let her know it . Be forceful , I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loudly . " You got any liquor ! " p. 133 JAMES MITCHELL Grasping his arm . Sh-sh  --  you idiot ! BILLY PARKER She 's a wonderful girl , Mitch . The DOWN-AND-OUT , dressed in a ragged overcoat and a moth-eaten cap , crosses the foreground of the scene from right to left . PARKER looks after him and calls . Heigh , Buddy ! But the tramp makes no reply as he goes on his lightless way . PARKER continues . I bet he 's one of the poor workers  --  ah  --  hungry , cold , maybe . Yeh , I 've seen his face somewhere . This money I got here would  --  Calling . Heigh , Buddy ! JAMES MITCHELL Grabbing him roughly . Want me to sock you ! Stop it , I say . BILLY PARKER Belligerently . Go ahead and hit me , Mitch , and I 'll beat hell out of you . Go ahead . JAMES MITCHELL Gazing at him . Yeh , and I believe you would ! LOUISE comes to the door . Ssh  --  Hello , Louise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a gay greeting . Hello , boys . BILLY PARKER Hello , little wild rose  --  my little tweetness  --  my  --  LOUISE steps down into the yard and MITCHELL takes PARKER by the arm as they go over towards her. p. 134 JAMES MITCHELL This is my friend , Mr.  --  er  --  Oakley . LOUISE Sticking out her hand . Glad to meet you , Mr. Oakley  --  PARKER shoots out his hand and gives her a crushing shake . LOUISE squeals . Oh , you hurt me ! BILLY PARKER Sorry . LOUISE Giggling . That 's all right  --  but take it easy . JAMES MITCHELL Putting his arm boldly around her . He 's a bit new to these matters , you know what I mean . Look  --  it 's this way , Mr.  --  BILLY PARKER The hell you say ! He sits down on the bench . LOUISE Putting her hand for an instant against MITCHELL 'S cheek . Sure , I understand , Mr. Johnson . MITCHELL drops his arm from her waist . And I can see your friend and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by PARKER 'S side and snuggling up against him . Sure we will . Gee , but you 've been slow . JAMES MITCHELL And how about Gracie ? LOUISE She 's upstairs yearning her heart out  --  smoked a whole package of Camels waiting . p. 135 BILLY PARKER In a high call . Price of Camels going up ! JAMES MITCHELL Pipe down ! Looking up and calling softly . Hey , my little bird , and ho my little bird ! A girl sticks her head out of the window above and we can see that she is dressed in some sort of negligee , her hair hanging down . GIRL Hello , Solomon , old boy . Here 's your thousand wives tied up in one . JAMES MITCHELL Ha-ha  --  hear that , folks ? Pushing PARKER and LOUISE together . I 'll meet you in the car in an hour , Par  --  Oakley , old boy . To LOUISE . Sorry we 're in a rush tonight , but we 've got examinations tomorrow . He hurries into the house . The girl upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bit ? BILLY PARKER Flinging his arm around her . Happy . Growling . No name for it . LOUISE Gasping . You 're breaking my ribs . Pushing him off and staring at him . Gee , but you 're strong . p. 136 BILLY PARKER Earnestly . Really think so ? That 's fine  --  fine . I 'm going to be stronger . He tries to put his arms around her again , but she stands up . LOUISE My , you 're anxious . Softly . Say , darling , you got any money ? BILLY PARKER Money ? A pocket full  --  He pulls out a wad of bills and crams them into her hands . My uncle 's a bishop  --  he takes up a collection once  --  sometimes twice every Sunday . LOUISE Bending over and kissing him on the lips the while she puts the money carefully into her coat pocket . You 're sweet  --  sweet  --  BILLY PARKER Pulling her down to him . And you 're sweet  --  sweet . You smell like a whole fieldful of flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit too many flowers , ai n't it ? BILLY PARKER Have it your way  --  one or a trillion  --  light years and all  --  Oratorically.  --  Hail , holy light , offspring of heaven 's first born  --  Good old light  --  that travels one hundred and eighty-six thousand , three hundred and sixty miles a second through curved space  --  p. 137 LOUISE Peering at him . What in heaven 's name  --  BILLY PARKER Heaven  --  heaven  --  everybody talking about heaven ai n't going there . Gazing up into the night . O thou most excellent heaven , the air , look you , that brave o'erhanging firmament , majestical roof fretted with golden fires , the poet 's inspiration and the lover 's dream ! Spitting . Why , it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors  --  dull , dead , and empty , as Dr. Bennett says . What a piece of work is woman that thou shouldst be mindful of her . Hah-hah-hah . LOUISE You 're drunk . BILLY PARKER Not drunk  --  not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduate  --  stuffed full of learning , running over with facts  --  rats and sponges and neuroses and psychoses and stimuli and reactions and graphs and theses and laws and principles and dates and events and characters and symbols and instruments and yardsticks . With windy grandilo-quence . Zomen agolistos me thanein  --  theon en gounasi keitai . LOUISE Giggling . What 's that  --  unknown tongues ? BILLY PARKER Greek . Still holding her . Got that from an old ethical man  --  We know little  --  even of approaching death  --  but the gods they know . Hah-hah  --  kiss me again . LOUISE hesitates and then bends and kisses him . Hah-hah . Do it some more . She kisses him again . PARKER shakes his head sadly . Do n't feel a thing  --  no impulse . Springing up and seizing her roughly by the shoulders . But I 'm going through with it , you understand  --  got to . p. 138 LOUISE As she tries to get loose from him . Oh , no you ai n't , if that 's the way you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm inhibited  --  got to break through  --  I do n't give a damn about you , see  --  you parasite on a speck of dust  --  you half-split chromosome  --  but I 'm not grown up yet  --  got to know um woman first  --  biology says so  --  good old biology  --  know um woman , then boy he change um quick and be velly much man . Letting go one of her shoulders , the while he holds on to the other , he gives her a resounding whack from behind . Get me ? She lets out a smothered oath and struggles harder to get loose . But he holds her fast and goes on volubly . Listen , big day coming ahead  --  Commencement  --  I got to speak  --  got to stand up before President Jarvis  --  in Memorial Hall  --  radio  --  alumni listening all over the world  --  Imitating a radio announcer.  --  Through the courtesy of station W.L.F.  --  My speech comes last  --  see  --  I got to do like Spinoza , like Martin Luther  --  tell ' em , tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll tell you an earful right now  --  let me loose ! p. 139 BILLY PARKER Ca n't do it  --  you got to help me  --  I got to get up courage to face ' em  --  got to stand up and tell ' em the truth  --  got to break through  --  be forceful  --  you see . LOUISE Hissing . I do n't see . And besides you 're crazy as a  --  BILLY PARKER Not crazy  --  not a bit  --  got to be ready for commencement day  --  throw off inhibitions  --  Brutally . Where 's your room ? Let 's go . LOUISE You 'll not get into my room .  --  I 'm scared of you  --  BILLY PARKER Wo n't , eh ? Cave man , do your stuff ! He grabs her by the hair and starts pulling her towards the door , she draws back , shaking her head in low moans . The struggle continues for a brief instant , then she begins to yell . LOUISE Help  --  help ! The shutter above is flung open and MITCHELL sticks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a muttered oath . You fool  --  stop that ! PARKER looks up . LOUISE gets free from him , and dashes towards the door . PARKER springs after her . She turns and flies around the house at the rear with PARKER in pursuit . MITCHELL 's head disappears from the window . A gabble of excited voices sets up inside the house . RACHEL comes hurrying in at the right front , followed by WINFORD behind. p. 140 EDGAR BELVIDERE WINFORD Miss Jarvis , I beg of you  --  RACHEL JARVIS Stopping and looking anxiously about her . Do n't beg , Dr. Winford . I 've got to find him . EDGAR BELVIDERE WINFORD But , Miss Jarvis  --  listen  --  this is no place for you now . RACHEL JARVIS Please , Dr. Winford . She goes up to the door and knocks . At this moment LOUISE and PARKER come from around behind the house at the left rear . Her arms are about his neck . LOUISE You 're a brute , ai n't you ? Just a natural wild brute . Kissing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . RACHEL JARVIS Oh , Billy ! With a low moan . Look , he 's kissing her . PARKER stops , gazes unsteadily out before him , then suddenly pushing LOUISE behind him , lurches over towards WINFORD . BILLY PARKER What the hell you doing here ? EDGAR BELVIDERE WINFORD Explain , Miss Jarvis , explain to him . BILLY PARKER I 'm not talking to her . Threateningly . Do n't you know this is no place to bring a lady ? p. 141 EDGAR BELVIDERE WINFORD In quick agreement as he backs towards the door . I certainly do . I certainly do . RACHEL JARVIS I 'm so ashamed  --  ashamed  --  EDGAR BELVIDERE WINFORD Come , Miss Jarvis . BILLY PARKER " Come , Miss Jarvis . " Y eh , come , Miss Jarvis . Well , you better do it quick . LOUISE comes up to him and he puts his arm around her . Here I was all ready to get uninhibited and you two come butting in . What business is it of yours ? Staring at WINFORD . Seems like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soothingly as he watches him warily . Do n't get excited , Mr. Parker , do n't  --  BILLY PARKER And I need to give free rein to it . Yeh , I think I 'll get uninhibited right now  --  blow off steam . Dr. Winford , I 'm going to beat hell out of you . EDGAR BELVIDERE WINFORD Horrified . Mr. Parker  --  you 're not yourself  --  BILLY PARKER I soon will be  --  He makes a lunge for WINFORD who with a , fleeting look of helplessness about him flies through the door slamming it shut behind him . PARKER springs against it with all his might . It gives way before him and he disappears inside . Immediately a hullabaloo sets up within  --  shouts and halloos and a medley of women 's high voices . Now the sound of running feet is heard , and several freshmen holding some of their clothes in their hands tear out through the door and from around the house and disappear into the night . The POLICEMAN comes hurrying in from the left front with his billy drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POLICEMAN Pushing her aside . Out of my way , tart . He runs on into the house . MITCHELL 'S voice is heard within . JAMES MITCHELL Heigh , hold him !  --  Hold that nut . LOUISE All right , sister , you better blow . As RACHEL stares at her . Jealous  --  hah . Angrily . Why'n the hell did you come here ? I was going to make him so happy . RACHEL JARVIS Then you did n't  --  did n't  --  LOUISE Did n't nothing . Take that . She slaps RACHEL in the face . RACHEL JARVIS It does n't hurt . It does n't hurt at all now . The POLICEMAN and MITCHELL come out holding the raging PARKER between them . POLICEMAN Behave yourself , young man , or I 'll give you a whack with this . BILLY PARKER Do and I 'll wring your neck , old man . I 'm a free personality . LOUISE To the POLICEMAN . Let me handle him . This is Louise , darling . BILLY PARKER Roaring at her . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MITCHELL To the POLICEMAN . I 'll take him home . There wo n't be any trouble . POLICEMAN All right and do it quick . JAMES MITCHELL Come on , Tarzan . BILLY PARKER Hear that , folkses  --  hah  --  hah . He gives a wild echoing yell . JAMES MITCHELL Yeh , there 's nothing uninhibited about you . BILLY PARKER That 's right , Mitch , that 's right . I did n't know my own power . Bowing puppet-like to those about him . Excuse me , ladies , excuse me , gentle dames . I got to sober up and write me a speech  --  Saluting the air . Here 's to commencement day ! He and MITCHELL go off at the right . POLICEMAN Calling towards the house . Come on out , professor , he 's gone . DR . WINFORD appears in the door . He peers gingerly out , rearranging his tie and rumpled shirt . RACHEL stares at him in undisguised chagrin an instant and then goes quickly away at the right . WINFORD hurries to overtake her . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house at the rear . The POLICEMAN spies him and shouts . Scat , you little fool ! The FRESHMAN disappears in the darkness. @x After the Black Out , the night-town piano dies away , and from the darkness the throbbing powerful blast of a great organ playing the opening bars of the alma mater song is heard . It stops for a two-beat rest and then begins again , accompanied by a multitude of lusty young men 's and women 's voices . VOICES Alma mater , alma mater , Hymns of praise be thine today  --  Here before thy sacred altarGarlands of our love we lay . &nbsp; &nbsp; Then it 's hail , ever hail , &nbsp; &nbsp; Sing triumphant , loudly cheer , &nbsp; &nbsp; Every heart true to thee , &nbsp; &nbsp; Alma mater , mother dear . Alma mater , alma mater , See the light of heaven fallsRadiant on thy cherished emblems , Ancient trees and ivied halls . &nbsp; &nbsp; Then it 's blest , ever blest , &nbsp; &nbsp; Marked with favor from above , &nbsp; &nbsp; Hail to thee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . The organ and the singing stop , and we hear in the distance the sound of hand-clapping . A moment passes and the light comes swiftly up giving us a view of the scene transformed into the stage of Memorial Hall on commencement day . Flowers and potted plants are set about and at the back is a huge oil portrait of the founder of the university draped in a United States flag and the college colors , and on either side of it tall stained glass windows partly opened through which the light of a sunny June morning pours . Ringed around the stage are the notables of the occasion  --  WILLIAM CARTER , the GOVERNOR , PRESIDENT JARVIS , DEAN WILLIAMS , DR . EVERETT , DR . BENNETT , DR . COLEMAN , DR . WALTON , DR . WINFORD , DR . LAWRENCE , and several other men and women leaders in the life of the state , the university and the nation . Most of them , with the notable exception of CARTER , are dressed in academic gowns . BILLY PARKER is sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with quiet emotionless countenance . PRESIDENT JARVIS is standing in front of a microphone at the speaker 's flag-covered stand . His gown is draped gracefully over his shoulders and his tall impressive figure is full of profound earnestness as he continues speaking . He is a man of about fifty or fifty-five , with a kindly full face and thick iron-gray hair . There is something about his poise and delivery which hint at the man who is accustomed to making addresses in public and finds it a pleasurable form of work . Not that he is a professional orator by any means , for his long association with university students and their serious youthful needs have taught him wiseness beyond that . But both from his manner and what he says it is clear that he is more the platform speaker and public educator than thinker and scholar . Years of presiding at faculty meetings , dealing with financial problems , begging gifts from wealthy alumni , conferences with trustees and wrangles with the state legislature for university appropriations have developed in him the dramatic gesture , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withal the go-getter 's drive . He is considered by many of the undergraduate students to be one of the greatest of living men , and when they read in the catalogue his lists of honorary degrees , they are but confirmed in that belief . The graduate students do n't find the president so hot nor do some of the scientific faculty members , but they all respect what is vaguely termed his fighting qualities . As for the alumni , generally they are willing to back him even to the White House , for the phenomenal growth of the university under his guidance is proof that he would do well there . The orchestra pit is occupied by a few members of the cast in cap and gown , representative of the graduating class . MITCHELL , RIGGS , EVANS , HOWARD , and RACHEL are in the center of the row . Seated just outside the pit at the left are PRATT and UNCLE BENNY , and in the same position to the right of the pit MISS MARY and LOUISE dressed in all their holiday finery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat . SIDNEY STEWART JARVIS Continuing his speech.  --  And it is our hope that within the coming twelve months our endowment will reach the round sum of fifty million dollars . There is applause from the seniors in the pit but none from PRATT who stares unseeingly before him . The total amount received by the university in fees as well as gifts and bequests from our loyal alumni  --  Leaning more closely towards the microphone.  --  and there are thousands of you , I 'm sure , listening today  --  the total amount received for this present scholastic year has been something slightly above seven million dollars . This plus the interest upon our investments in gilt-edged securities , brings the total up to approximately ten million dollars . We hope , yes , we sincerely believe , we have expended this sum wisely . When we consider some of the results produced in the field of scholarship we are very proud indeed . During the year which is now behind us , many of our research scholars have increased still further the fame of our alma mater and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's knowledge . The head of our English Department , Dr. Aloysius G. Hard , who has been pursuing research abroad for the last two years , has found in an abandoned monastery in northern France the lost records dealing with the killing of Rufus the Red , the first Anglo-Saxon king . For hundreds of years scholars have known that such a manuscript existed , but it remained for our own Dr. Hard to make the discovery . Here PRATT lets out a low muffled grunt . Some of the students , especially HOWARD , look reprimandingly around at him , but DR . JARVIS has not heard it . He continues . From ancient Palestine has come another discovery of world-wide interest and importance . Our eminent law dean , Dr. Stacy Muckenfuss , on leave of absence for research into the semitic sources of the code Napoleon , discovered by accident only last month an Arabic manuscript which throws new light on the interpretation of the question of justice  --  as laid down in the New Testament . His voice a bit higher . One of our anthropologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect of diet on the neuroses and psychoses of the headhunters of West Africa . This work is just beginning there and Dr. Amadeus Genug has been granted leave of absence for a year and ample funds with which to assist Dr. Koon in his research . Again our excavations in the ruins of Utah are being carried rapidly forward . On the alkali ridge in the southeastern part of the state Dr. Brewster Fleetwood of the Archeology Department has excavated more than a hundred and sixty-four rooms , pit houses and kivas which greatly increases our knowledge about the food habits and housing of the ancient Pueblo Indians . And in South America our illustrious Dr. Julius C. Bernard reports a great advance in his study of " pioneer environment and social groupings . " And so it goes . I could continue far too long for this occasion in listing these great projects which are being fostered by this university . There are some forty-four major ones , representing every important field of study , and all of supreme importance , distributed all over the world . Pausing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I consider that one hundred and ten years ago this university opened its doors with three students and two professors , and now consider its present size  --  I am filled with awe at the responsibility which has developed upon me as its head , to lead it forward into new fields of service . From that small beginning it has grown until it reaches its arms around the wide world , its hands holding up the light of learning and illuminating the dark places of ignorance to the nethermost corner .  --  But I digress  --  here at home we have also done great  --  But a sudden Black Out simultaneously with the crash of the organ chords in the opening bars of the alma mater song , finishes his speech for him . An instant later the light comes up again on the same scene and the GOVERNOR is speaking . He is a heavy-set middle-aged man with a rolling booming voice. p. 145 THE GOVERNOR  --  And as Governor of this state I pledge you  --  in so far as a balanced budget will allow  --  the full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state house to the most humble precinct  --  in the great cause of education . As an alumni  --  a sort of ex-alumni , since being a poor boy I was only able to stay here but one year  --  and as a citizen and head of my party here , I am proud of your accomplishments . I am proud of your great football team and our all-American Johnny Meacham , but  --  He lifts up his hand and waits for the applause to die down.  --  but , I say , I am just as proud of your scholars  --  those Dr. Jarvis mentioned and such men as Dr. Coleman  --  Bowing towards him.  --  who through his statististical  --  He blunders over the word.  --  studies is showing us how to develop a fuller family life  --  and Dr. Walton  --  He bows towards him.  --  your great biologist , and also such men as Dr. Winford.  --  He bows towards WINFORD who sits looking at the floor.  --  your brilliant psychologist , whose column on Mental Daily Health is syndicated in over two hundred newspapers , bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a little at this . Yes , my friends , between you and I  --  it has brought help to us in our heavy problems as chief executive of this glorious commonwealth  --  no greater praise can I give . And then our distinguished president  --  Turning slightly towards DR . JARVIS who sits in genteel but basking immobility.  --  Dr. Jarvis , I bring to you the thanks , the felicitations of the nine million citizens of this state . Under your guidance this institution has taken her rightful place at the top of all educational institutions in the world . With a touch of sanctimony in his voice . And I ask upon you and your colleagues the blessings and the aid of the Creator who no doubt at this moment is looking down upon His handiwork and not only finds what He has done to be goodly and worthy of praise , but yours in such measure likewise . My admiration and service are yours to command . As I have been your friend in the past , so I shall continue to be , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to elevate me still higher in political life , I promise you here and now that what few talents I possess shall be laid upon the altar of this my country and my state . Loud applause breaks around him . He comes over to the edge of the rostrum and looks down at the students . And to you fifteen hundred graduates who now are going forth into the great arena of life , I bring you congratulations and best wishes for the success you so richly deserve . Also I wish at this time to personally thank those of you who aided our militia in settling the recent deplorable labor crisis . May you ever be ready so to serve your state and its constitution . He steps back to the stand and turns to WILLIAM CARTER.  --  And now to you , sir , William Carter , more affectionately known as Billy Carter to us all , I extend to you the thanks of the university , of the thousands of alumni listening to the sound of my voice , and the thanks of all the people  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  for your long-continued devotion to this institution , both financially and otherwise . Applause . And now ladies and gentlemen , upon this notable occasion it gives me the most singular and happiest pleasure to formally accept for the university the Honorable William Carter 's latest gift , the Carter Memorial Tower  --  constructed at a cost of more than a million dollars  --  Long applause . CARTER bows and smiles . The poets , sir , have long sung of the power of music upon the human soul , and when at the twilight hour these bells ring out their evening song of harmony and joy , sending their message of fellowship and love spreading from the hilltops to the valleys , falling on the ears of rich and poor alike , may each and every one that hears them feel the call to a richer , nobler life of service  --  like the life of him who honors us with his presence here today . For as long as this tower shall stand , men shall rise up and call him blessed . Yes , let these chimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said  --  " Ring in the valiant man and free  --  The larger heart , the kindlier hand , Ring out the darkness of the land , Ring in the Christ that is to be . " Loud applause breaks forth again from the notables on the stage and from those in and around the pit . The GOVERNOR bows his head an instant , then signals to those around him and everybody on the rostrum rises , likewise the members of the cast in front of the stage . And now while the audience stands , the Carter Memorial chimes will play for the first time our cherished alma mater song . In the distance the chimes begin in the alma mater song , a little cacophonous and brazen , but strong and triumphant withal . The scene gradually fades out as if in time to the music , and the chimes die away . An instant later the light comes up again , and the GOVERNOR is introducing PARKER.  --  And it gives me great pleasure to introduce him to you . Billy Parker 's brilliant record here has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his qualities of student leadership , his loyalty and devotion to his alma mater have all made him a most worthy recipient of the honor which he bears today . In him this university presents to you at this hour the finest example of what she does in the making of men . Walking over to PARKER , he shakes his hand . Then putting his arm around BILLY as he rises , he leads him towards the speaker 's desk as the notables and seniors applaud.  --  And as this institution is proud of him now I prophesy she will be more proud of him in years to come . And fitting it is that he has chosen for his oration " The Student and the University . " He bows , turns , and sits down . PARKER now stands by the speaker 's desk , his diploma and manuscript held in his hands before him . For a moment he stares ahead of him , swallows once or twice , then begins to speak , in a quiet , even voice. p. 146 BILLY PARKER Four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , entered this university in search of  --  an education . CARTER crosses his legs , leans back in his chair to listen.  --  We came here as eager freshmen , full of admiration , even awe before these great buildings , these laboratories , and these professors who seemed to us at that time much more than ordinary men . Now today we leave this university and turn our faces down the road that stretches ahead of us . His voice dies out and then rises again . There somewhere waits the life we are to live . There wait the joys , the hopes , the successes and the failures that will be our lot . It is for this journey ahead that we have spent these four years preparing ourselves , and now the question is  --  are we prepared ? He looks down at the row of seniors before him . Fellow classmates , you have elected me to represent you here this morning , and you must forgive me if in what I have to say I may speak less your intention than my own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you alone , but for the thousands of other fellows like me who have been filled with the same questioning and doubt that now fill me . Leaning nearer to the microphone . You alumni , alumnae , and friends who are gathered here together , you loyal supporters of this great institution who are listening in over the radio , all of you who have heard with great pleasure the story of progress and world-wide research which President Jarvis has unrolled for you  --  no doubt you are deeply gratified that this university stands as a champion for truth and righteousness and wisdom , fellowship , brotherhood , and justice unto all . You have been told that , and so have we students , not only once but thousands of times . It is a kind of refrain all universities sing unceasingly . But standing here this morning  --  His voice stronger , heavier . I say that so far as I am concerned there 's little meaning in it . CARTER uncrosses his legs and sits bolt upright staring at PARKER with open mouth . DR . JARVIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then sits down again . A murmur passes among the seniors , RACHEL gasps and then leans forward , and the deans , the professors , and other notables on the rostrum shift about uneasily . But PARKER has gone levelly on and the scene quiets down again . When I came here four years ago , an eager , happy boy , the world was a beautiful and inspiring place to live in , I was anxious for the next day to come , anxious to be at the business of learning something new , something that would give me a wider vision , a broader comprehension of myself and of the world around me  --  yes , searching for an education from these wise men . For a while I believed what they told me . But in my junior year I began to be uneasy , suspicious , distrustful of what they said . It seemed to me that the only words they knew were scholarship , scholarship  --  research , research . And as I look back on my college career which now comes to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that my professors did all they could  --  unwittingly of course , but still they did it  --  did all they could to kill whatever enthusiasm , whatever delight , whatever of beauty I used to see in the world ! Twisting his head and going on as the notables sit in horrified silence . Scholarship , they said  --  research , research  --  these are what make an institution great . And it 's all the same , they say , whether the scholarship and research deal with tadpoles , sponges , oysters , headhunters in Africa , fig leaves or man 's soul itself .  --  Excuse me , I had forgot  --  in their view man has no soul . Knowledge for the sake of knowledge ; facts , get the facts . And right now I ask you , and I ask them what are these facts ? What have they to do with the great productions of man 's genius and his dreams ? With boyish vehemence . Is Hamlet a fact ? Is Lear a fact ? Are any of the great works of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired from the burning crucibles of man 's imagination , and our purpose in studying them should have been to receive some of that fire and imagination into our own souls . And the one way to keep that from ever happening was to set the students down in this valley of dry bones gathering the facts . And yet that 's what Dr. Chadwick said we must do  --  as he spent the lecture hours showing how Milton used the wrong Latin ending in one of his poems  --  and never a word about his immortal poetry . Suddenly LOUISE rises out of her seat and shouts. p. 147 LOUISE You tell ' em , Billy ! Hands are raised up to pull her down . The scene blacks out followed by the organ with its crashing chords . The light comes up and PARKER is still speaking . He is somewhat excited now as his words pour out , and the people on the rostrum are outdone . BILLY PARKER Yes , I wanted something besides these facts , I wanted something to believe in , something to inspire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep my faith in myself and in the human race . In the catalogue it speaks about a body of truth , of knowledge . Where is this truth , this knowledge ? They do n't tell you where to find it . No , Dr. Walton here tells you one thing in biology and Dr. Coleman tells you another in sociology , and Dr. Winford there says that the way to salvation lies in the study of guinea pigs and rats and roosters and jackasses and anything else that he can drag into the laboratory . WINFORD still sits looking at the floor . And Dr. Everett tells you that the philosophers are the only men who have the truth . And the Economics professors say no , the greatest thing in this world is Economics  --  the study of man as a money unit . And then over in his department Dr. Chester says education courses are the most important , and with a lot of colored chalks he draws all sorts of formulas on the blackboard  --  all about medians and modes and means and quartile deviations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it they have to take a couple of drinks before they can come to class . And then I go to astronomy to learn about the beauty of the stars and the handiwork of God and Dr. Bennett hits me between the eyes with the dry and dead announcement to the effect that the universe is dying down and it 's all desolation and woe ahead of us and there 's no hope anywhere for ruined and pitiful man . Shaking his head wearily . And so we 're pulled from one theory to another  --  going round and round , like hypnotized rats in a maze of enchantment  --  baffled , confused , lost , discouraged , not knowing what to believe nor where to turn . The people on the rostrum are stirring more restlessly and murmuring among themselves . DR . WALTON , staring over at PRESIDENT JARVIS , can be heard speaking as PARKER pauses an instant in his flow of words. p. 148 HUGH CAMERON WALTON Stop him , Jarvis . BILLY PARKER Turning his flashing eyes upon him . Do n't let me bother you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm nothing but a piece of dying protoplasm on my way out  --  I do n't count . DR . WINFORD shifts in his seat and mutters to himself . And you , Dr. Winford , do n't hold me responsible for what I am saying . I 'm nothing but a psychological machine that talks . Stimulus has been applied , response has followed , the rooster crows . DR . BENNETT leans over and speaks to WINFORD . And do n't let it disturb you , Dr. Bennett , I 'm nothing but a speck of dust  --  and brief and powerless is man 's life , over him omnipotent matter holds her ceaseless sway , and the slow doom of darkness and the certainty of the grave shall sweep him to death 's oblivion and thus take away his cowardice and make him able to stand on his own feet . WILLIAM CARTER Explosively . My God , he 's eloquent ! He nervously pulls out a cigar , lights it and sits puffing away , oblivious of his actions . LOUISE is heard giggling , and PRATT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JARVIS Standing up in grave and menacing authority . I declare these exercises adjourned . Drop the curtain . p. 149 WILLIAM CARTER Roaring . Siddown , everybody , and let him get it out of his system . They gradually all sit down and the scene grows calm again . The starting curtain obediently pulls itself back , and PARKER goes on . BILLY PARKER Yes , these are the things they teach at this university and at the other universities in this scientific age  --  filling us with generalities , dead facts , and discouragement , mis-educating us and making us unfit to face the world we live in with any real enthusiasm , inspiration and hope . His voice high and quivering now . And where does the money come from  --  the vast sums that are being wasted here in the name of education ? I 'll tell you  --  from the money-bags of the thieving capitalists who like the distinguished alumnus that sits on our rostrum today seek to buy their way to what they call fame and glory . And where do they get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscle power of their enslaved fellowman  --  from the underfed babies , the toil-worn mothers , the broken fathers who will never have a chance to come inside these doors , and little good it would do them if they did . Down on the campus there you have engraved in letters of stone " From darkness into light . " Let it be reversed to read " From light into darkness , " for that 's the way plenty of us feel . Vehemently . And because I feel it and ca n't keep quiet any longer , I 'm standing up here in disgrace this morning and saying so . It 's time somebody did it . Trying to control the tremor in his voice . Yes , these professors have lost their vision somewhere , these leaders have shut themselves away in darkness while people starve at their doors and oppression and injustice grow rank about them  --  while fear and horror walk the earth , while the great problems of man wait to be solved . Why do n't they stand up and face these problems ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  PRESIDENT JARVIS bows his head over , shamed and disconsolate . WINFORD suddenly leans over to JARVIS and is seen speaking hurriedly to him . PARKER goes on.  --  No , they continue to mumble their empty phrases , pursue their blind piddling , getting down on their knees to lick boots and pass out degrees to millionaires for more endowments . Half-shouting . I deny this education ! I denounce it . Gesturing vaguely in the air . Somewhere out there in the world maybe  --  there 's a truth to hunt for , it 's not here . There I 'll begin all over  --  I 'll  --  He turns and feels his way blindly towards his seat . The scene blacks out , followed by the crash of the organ chords in a bar of the alma mater song . The lights come up more brightly on the pit . PRATT is seen standing up and looking out over the audience with drawn and twitching face . At the right LOUISE is also standing up applauding vehemently . UNCLE BENNY is sitting in quiet grave dignity looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she dabs her eyes with her handkerchief . Yee-oo ! MISS MARY Pulling her down . For God 's sake , Louise ! HENRY PRATT Calling out thickly as he wags his head . Yeh , he told ' em the truth . Go ahead and applaud . But you do n't , for it do n't do no good . Nothing does any good any more  --  nothing does any good among these hypocrites and thieves . They 're too powerful  --  sitting in the seat of the mighty  --  there on the rostrum fat and balmy and close to God 's favor . He spits . JAMES MITCHELL From the pit , unable to restrain himself . Stop it , you fool . HENRY PRATT Moving out into the aisle and swaying sickly as he grips the pit rail for support . Fool  --  that 's right  --  that 's me . Look at me  --  I 've been studying Latin for four years  --  four years  --  and my mother working her heart out down in old Carter 's mills to pay for it and to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others like her . And last week these damned professors flunked me on my final exam . PAT RIGGS From the pit , hissing out his words . Scram , you 're drunk . p. 151 HENRY PRATT I 'm drunk  --  okay , and have it your way  --  uhm  --  for days . But I know what I 'm saying  --  know what I 'll do  --  what I 'll do . I know that  --  in Japan they say  --  in ancient Rome likewise . Yeh and they flunked me and today I do n't wear the cap and bells  --  cap and gown . And why ? Because I could n't remember whether Jupiter Pluvius died on Saturday or Sunday  --  could n't remember the facts  --  that 's what they said . But liars  --  liars all of ' em . It was because they did n't like my politics  --  me fighting against the millionaire  --  fighting for the underdog  --  so they would n't let me graduate . And what do I say ? I say to hell with ' em . Now in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet on me . But they 'll be sorry  --  Bobbing his head about in a queer gesture . I 'll pay ' em  --  and what do I say to you ?  --  the same . To hell with you ! He turns and wobbles unsteadily off and out at the right . A crash of the organ sounds , and the light comes up again on the rostrum . CARTER is speaking before the microphone . PARKER has resumed his seat and is staring before him with hard set face . WILLIAM CARTER Stuttering with anger . Yes , this young John the Baptist or Jeremiah crying in the wilderness here has burnt my hide off and considerably singed everything else on the landscape . Maybe you loyal alumni and alumnae listening in all over the world think there 's right much commotion going on here , but no , we 're fairly calm right in the face of rampant youth . Memorial Hall is still standing and nobody has committed murder  --  though right at this minute I 'm mad enough to . He bites his cigar in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And short of murder I 'd like to get a switch the way my mother used to do me and frale the lard out of this young Demosthenes . I 'm a plain man and speak in plain words on this occasion , for now is no time for commencement oratory . The very honor of this university has been challenged by one of her socalled brightest students , and there 's either something in what he says or there 's not . Whirling on PARKER . So you do n't like this place  --  eh ? It do n't suit you . You think you can bawl it out and let it go at that . Well , you ca n't . For I 'll call your hand . I do n't mind a fight  --  I love it when it 's in the open . Turning back to the microphone . I 'm a fellow can take his medicine , and this young squirt has fed me plenty . He has not only denounced the university which I love  --  and which I would n't be surprised if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right , let him denounce , but wait until he tries to run either of them . He 'll have more worries and less words . And when I say that I 'm ready to say something else too  --  mad as I am  --  and that is I recognize grit when I see it . And this fellow 's got it . Maybe being named after me did him some good after all  --  hah-hah . He 's the first boy I 've ever seen with guts enough to stand up on an occasion like this and speak his mind .  --  Shut up down there !  --  And you , Dr. Jarvis , straighten up your face , the university is not ruined .  --  And my good friends out there in the audience  --  Billy Parker 's family  --  I would n't feel any too much shame over your boy . Many a young fellow has wanted to do what he has done . Maybe some of us did when we graduated , but we did n't have the nerve . Turning back to PARKER . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name is  --  since you say the university is all shot to hell what are you going to do about it ? PARKER sits silent , staring before him . Ca n't answer  --  eh ? Got no program of action  --  huh ? Well , I 'm one who believes that the fellow who is so quick to point out our evils ought to be able to give some advice about curing them . What do you suggest ? p. 152 BILLY PARKER In a muffled voice . Nothing , sir , I  --  WILLIAM CARTER Wrathfully . " Nothing , sir "  --  . But out in the world somewhere maybe , vague and indefinite , out there somewhere you 'll find the truth . Well , let me tell you the world is here , right here , and there are plenty of problems right here . Wrathfully . No , maybe you 're like thousands of other American kids that graduate from college , mistaking the yen in their bellies for the stirrings of their souls . Yeh , maybe you 'll want to go a-roaming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sail on a freighter to the land of Eldorado , or farm yourself out in the desert  --  hoping to pick up wisdom and experience that way , expecting this almighty inspiration and vision or whatever it is to fall on you like David 's mantle or whoever the hell 's mantle it was . Striking his hands together . Let me tell you , young man  --  and I want all you young people down there in front of me to hear this  --  you ca n't run away from a job . When it meets you you 've got to meet it . To PARKER . All right , let 's see you meet this . Snapping . I heard you once say you wanted to teach . All right , pick out your subject  --  philosophy , psychology , science  --  anything , and I 'll endow the damned department . I 'll buy you the finest equipment in the world and plenty of it , and you can go after this glory , this truth and wisdom you talk about . And when you find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he 'll know how to run his university and I 'll know how to settle my labor problems and run my mills . All right , speak up . It 's an offer and my word 's as good as my check . p. 153 BILLY PARKER Stammering . I  --  I  --  no , sir , I do n't want it . WILLIAM CARTER What do you want ? BILLY PARKER Somewhere in the world I 'll get me a job  --  Blurting out . Work with my hands  --  among people  --  people like Uncle Benny down there . He 's taught me more than any professor here . UNCLE BENNY looks about him in perplexity and then sits still , blinking up at the rostrum . WILLIAM CARTER Sardonically . All right , I can fix you up in that . You can start in one of my mills tomorrow as a laborer . There 's plenty of work with your hands and plenty of people . Take your choice  --  the top or the bottom . BILLY PARKER Doggedly . I 'll  --  I 'll start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's where I started and I wound up a millionaire . Gesturing out at the audience . I 've finished , and I think you got to say I 've been mighty fair . There is applause from the rostrum and the pit . CARTER turns away from the microphone and paces the rostrum over at the right . Pulling out another cigar , he lights it , then realizes what he is doing , hurriedly extinguishes it , and sits down . In the meantime PRESIDENT JARVIS has risen and moved quickly over to the stand. p. 154 SIDNEY STEWART JARVIS Lifting his hand and speaking hurriedly into the microphone . Ladies and gentlemen , friends , I must apologize for the turn this occasion has taken , and if I had known the facts in the case I would have seen that no such embarrassing situation occurred . You all must have wondered why our young commencement speaker delivered the speech he did . I myself have wondered in the midst of agitation and shame . But now I understand and I want you to understand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . PARKER looks sharply up and CARTER sits bolt upright again . From our eminent psychologist , Dr. Winford , I have just learned that for some time Mr. Parker has been in a state of high nervous tension due to overwork and worry . That accounts for his hysterical behavior on this platform . It is unfortunate and  --  RACHEL JARVIS Springing up in the pit and crying out . That 's not true , Father , it 's not ! Shame . PRESIDENT JARVIS starts back bewildered , and then as RACHEL turns and goes out through the stage door at the left , he grasps the stand with both hands and carries on . SIDNEY STEWART JARVIS Swallowing . Ah  --  er  --  sad indeed , and we extend our deepest sympathy to the young man . We are assured though , that with the proper rest and medical care he will be himself again in a few days . CARTER breaks into a low chuckle . JARVIS hurries on . And so we bring to a close this the one hundred and tenth commencement of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the future  --  an ever bigger , ever brighter future . Our watchword is forward . Curtly . Pronounce the benediction . Everybody on the rostrum with the exception of PARKER rises and stands with bowed head . The MINISTER takes a step forward. p. 155 MINISTER Now may the grace of God , the communion and fellowship of the holy spirit come down , rest and abide with us henceforth and forever more . Amen . In the distance the glee-club chorus starts humming the alma mater song in a low deep harmony . And now the seniors get up from the front . PAT RIGGS Of all the  --  JAMES MITCHELL Seething with vexation and anger . He 's a fool  --  a crazy fool ! JOE HOWARD And that Pratt  --  God . They go out at the right and left , EVANS silent and thoughtful among them . LOUISE , MISS MARY , and UNCLE BENNY follow . On the rostrum the faculty and notables have eddied silently about for a moment and then begun to go out  --  DR . WINFORD leaving first of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scene from the right , hesitates a moment and then hurries over towards PARKER . She stops a little distance away from him and stands looking at him , the tears wetting her cheeks . CARTER starts out and as he passes PARKER gives him a heavy slap on the shoulder that might mean anything , either " rotten " or " right . " PARKER looks up and then springs to his feet as he sees RACHEL . CARTER stops and observes them. p. 156 RACHEL JARVIS With a little choked cry . Oh , Billy ! BILLY PARKER His face tight and gray as he mumbles . I know  --  I 've ruined everything  --  but I had to do it . RACHEL JARVIS Her chin quivering . You  --  you were wonderful ! Parker stares at her incredulously an instant and then she flies into his arms . WILLIAM CARTER As a smile begins to creep around his grim lips . Hum  --  everything all right now  --  like in a story book  --  brave knight in the cause of truth  --  fair lady waiting . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JARVIS Gazing up at PARKER through her tears . Forgive me , Billy . I  --  I was a fool . I 've known it ever since that  --  that night down there . BILLY PARKER Rachel . RACHEL JARVIS You 're great  --  great and  --  I love you . I do , Billy . Let me be with you  --  out there with you . Together we 'll begin at the bottom  --  begin all over again , working together  --  forget all this . I mean it , Billy , I do . Her voice chokes with a sob and she clings to him. p. 157 BILLY PARKER His face crinkling almost into a cry like a child 's . S-ss-h  --  yes , you with me  --  out there  --  beginning again . He kisses her , oblivious of the notables and faculty who have stopped in the background . SIDNEY STEWART JARVIS His face averted from RACHEL and PARKER as they turn away to the right . We will adjourn now to the alumni luncheon which is to follow immediately . He nods to the governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the rear outside , and then a scream , followed by other shouts and the sound of running feet . The remaining notables and professors turn quickly to the rear windows and look out . HUGH CAMERON WALTON Something 's happened there at the Carter Memorial . GEORGE LINDSAY BENNETT A crowd 's gathered . Several of the group start to go out at the left , CARTER first of all . But they are met by DEAN WILLIAMS who comes hurriedly in and begins speaking to DR . JARVIS in grave low tones . A look of vexation and pain spreads over the president 's face . WILLIAM CARTER What 's happened ? p. 158 SIDNEY STEWART JARVIS In a low voice . An unfortunate accident . Bowing his head . Dean Williams . CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS Quietly . A young man has jumped from the tower and killed himself . WILLIAM CARTER In horror as a gasp breaks from the group . My God ! BILLY PARKER Gripping RACHEL 'S hand in convulsive apprehension . Ah  --  He stares at DEAN WILLIAMS in fascination . THE GOVERNOR Breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? CLIFFORD FISHER WILLIAMS A student by the name of Henry Pratt . With hurried assurance . He has no relatives among you . In the distance the glee club swells out more loudly.
