Margaret Sanger last week had a second opportunity to beg Congress to lift Federal inhibitions against Birth Control . Senator Frederick Huntington Gillett , 79 , Massachusetts , was her friend at court . his time . The other time ( 1924 ) her friend was another aged Senator , the late Albert Baird Cummins of Iowa , then 75 . Senator Cummins had tried ineffectually to pass a law making contraceptive information and devices available to all the people , a liberty which Mrs. Sanger , a trained nurse , did not altogether approve . Senator Gillett is fostering a law to make such information and devices available only to doctors . If Congress were , through some reversal of national mores , to pass any such law it would have no practical effect in those States which forbid Birth Controlling within their dominions . <P> Nonetheless Senator Gillett , as chairman of a subcommittee of the Senate 's Judiciary Committee , listened to Mrs. Sanger and a squad of supporters . Then he listened to her opponents . Assisting him was Senator Sam Gilbert Bratton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 65. of Idaho , member of the subcommittee , stayed away . Senators ' wives crowded the hearing room . <P> Vigorous were the arguments for and against Birth Control . <P> Pro . " We want parenthood to be regarded as something beyond and above a casual accident or a punishment as a result of shiftlessness and recklessness. " - Mrs . Sanger . <P> " There is a huge bootleg trade in contraceptives . Accurate and competent advice in regard to Birth Control would save the lives of thousands of women , and a doctor who has this information and does not give it . incurs a terrible responsibility . " - John Whitridge Williams , Johns Hopkins obstetrician . <P> " The bird of war is not the eagle , but the stork . " - The Rev. Charles Francis Potter , Manhattan . <P> <P> " We must control population . . . . We are forced to a choice . Nature 's remedies are pestilence , war , disease and famine . Personally I prefer to substitute the more human method to the cruel natural process . " - Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Junior League of New York is " overwhelmingly in favor " of the Gillett Bill . " Our work in settlements and hospitals has shown us that control of the birth rate by this means is absolutely necessary . " - Mrs . Douglas M. Moffatt , chairman of the local League 's legislative committee . <P> Contra . Opponents to Birth Control were just as scrappy as Mrs. Sangers battlers : most of them were Roman Catholics , whose Pope has sternly denounced Birth Control ( TIME , Jan. 19 ) . <P> " The earth is capable of supporting 7,000,000,000 people and it now contains about 1,750,000,000 . " <P> - Representative John W. McCormack of Massachusetts . <P> " The more sacrifice marriage entails , the greater the amount of happiness results . " <P> - Representative Mary Teresa Norton of New Jersey . ( Her only son died . ) " The gross obscenity of a pamphlet written by a woman in Brooklyn*is so shocking that if I were not controlled by Christian sentiment , I would feel like shooting a man who would hand such a pamphlet to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give such advice as was necessary to their patients and would continue to do so .
