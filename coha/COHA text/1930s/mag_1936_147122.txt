" See here , you 're doing all the talking ! " bellowed Pennsylvania 's Lieut . Governor Thomas Kennedy one night last week at an unidentified speaker in the State Senate gallery in Harrisburg . " I happen to be the President of the Senate , not you ! " " Boo , " chorused some 500 men , women &; children as they pounded the brass gallery railings with sticks . " Quit stalling ! Pass bills ! Pass bills ! " they screamed , raining their sticks down on the Senate floor below . <P> Three days &; nights of such rowdy high jinks by organized jobless in the galleries last week forced Pennsylvania 's General Assembly into submission . For 13 weeks its Democratic House and Republican Senate had haggled in special session over relief for the State 's 560,000 needy . Last month when funds ran out , a small group of unemployed rolled into Harrisburg by bus , made themselves so obnoxious that Republicans and Democrats advanced $3,000,000 for temporary relief . Last fortnight the $3,000,000 were gone and the army trooped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hand-out of $4,000 from the State 's homeless and transient relief funds , the determined demonstrators last week forced the House and Senate to agree in principle on a program of some $45,000,000 to furnish relief until next February . <P> Stage manager of this legislative demonstration last week was slim , almost chinless , 34-year-old President David Lasser of the Workers Alliance of America . By now a thoroughgoing professional at marching his squads of unemployed into a State capitol and virtually taking over the legislative proceedings in the name of higher relief standards , Lasser and his Workers made their headline debut at Madison , Wis. last March . There soft-hearted Governor Philip La Follette welcomed them into the State House , provided them with food , advised them to " turn the heat " on the Legislature . After they had camped in the Senate chamber for ten days , Governor La Follette realized his mistake , had them turned out . <P> Last April 700 Workers Alliance delegates marched on Washington to hold convention and see Franklin Roosevelt , who was vacationing in the South . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by " 129,958-to-21,413 " to unite with other jobless unions , notably the National Unemployment Councils , Communist Herbert Benjamin 's organization of radical-minded unemployed which had been staging intermittent " hunger marches " on the U. S. Capitol ever since 1931 . Three weeks later , members of this new and larger Workers Alliance invaded Trenton , N. J. , occupied the State House , jeered the Legislature with abandon , were finally thrown out by police for their bad manners ( TIME , May 4 ) . Last week 's Harrisburg extravaganza was on a pattern rapidly becoming standard practice whenever a State Legislature stalls on jobless relief .
