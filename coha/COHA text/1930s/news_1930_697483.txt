txt Sir Henri Deterding , one of the " criminals " in the Moscow engineers ' trial , is convinced the proceedings are intended to cloak imminent failure of the Soviet 's fiveyear industrialization plan . With a vacant chair awaiting him in the Moscow court room , Sir Henri regards the trial itself as a " Hollywood show , " but considers the conditions underlying it serious for Russia and the outside world . He contends the purpose of the trial is to transfer Vie blame in the eyes of the Russian people from their dictators in the Kremlin to their foreign " enemies . " The oil man laughed today at the row of empty chairs in which the Bolshevist leaders would like to place Winston Churchill , Colonel Lawrence , Raymond Poincare and himself as the arch conspirators against Russia . Sees Move to Shift Blame . " The charge of a foreign plot is ridiculous on the face of it , " he said at an interview in his London office today . " Krylenko and the Soviet leaders know those charges are absurd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confessions ' have been extorted from the engineers and then broadcast by the films and radio throughout the length and breadth of Russia to take the blame from Stalin 's shoulders . " I always have been opposed to military intervention in , Russia . It would get us nowhere and could only lead to bloodshed . Just as an example , I remember warning the German General Hoffman against a military expedition into Russia in 1923 . Otherwise there has been no hint of foreign intervention  --  as far as I can remember  --  since the days of Wranhell and the White armies . " But I do believe that as long as the present regime exists in Russia there is going to be dislocation of world trade and misery inside and outside Russia 's borders . I am certain that Russian underconsumption and lack of buying power is the cause of America 's distress today . And if the people in the United States ask me how long the depression will last I will tell them , ' As long as this gang rules Russia . ' " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean the United States , England , France and Germany  --  is to make an agreement not to buy from Russ2a or advance a dollar of credit . The further Stalin advances into his five-year plan the more he will need foreign help . And the Bolshevist regime in Russia will collapse in three weeks with joint action by the . powers . " Not Worried by Dumping . Unlike many business leaders of England and the United States , Sir Henri is not worried by Russian dumping . Overproduction , he insisted to this correspondent , is not the cause of the world trade depression . The real cause , he believes , is under-consumption  --  enforced by the Soviet dictatorship  --  so Russia 's 150,000,000 are consuming only as much as 60,000,000 consumed before the war and China 's 400,000,000 are consuming only three-fourths of what they are capable of consuming . " Nobody can tell me that when you cut off 200,000,000 consumers from the world 's export trade you are not affecting it , " he continued . " Stalin 's very existence depends on under-consumption in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week in a nation of plenty . It can only live by a system of bread cards and by the ruthless cutting off of the people 's supplies . Then , if they disobey , you can cut off their bread supply . " Russian dumping is not intentional . It is the inevitable result of forced under-consumption . Surplus supplies must be rushed outside the country before the people themselves can get them . I do n't regard dumping as a deliberate attack on capitalistic nations . It is a result which the Soviet leaders never foresaw and were not prepared for . " Nobody worries about American overproduction in normal times . American overproduction is balanced by American consumption ? the greatest consuming power in the world . It is only when . overproduction is not offset by consumption that trouble arises . " . Sees Five-Year  --  Plan Doomed . The five-year plan , Sir Henri believes , is doomed to utter failure because of Russian human nature and because of Russia 's dependence on outside help . " The Russian is an intelligent , likable fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great literature . But you can not organize him into a machine or make a robot of him . It is difficult enough to organize two Russians . When you try to organize three you get only disorganization . " There were some good Russian engineers and factory managers , but now most of them have been shot . The operation of the five-year plan depends now on foreign experts who have been called in . And 80 per cent of those American and German engineers are determined to stay not a minute longer than their contracts demand . They do not complain of the lack of food or bad treatment because they get special treatment . But they are sick of the misery and squalor in the midst of which they are forced to live . " From what American friends of mine have told me I am certain there will be an exodus of all foreign engineers , factory managers and other experts the moment they are released from their contracts . Then where will the five-year plan be ? " Tells of April 1 Plot . Among his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " arch-criminal " in the Moscow trial . He likes to hush his voice to a whisper and tell of the diabolical plot to be launched on April 1 , 1931 . " Remember the date ! " he exclaims . On that day , he warns , he will march from the London headquarters of the Royal Dutch Shell Company with all his employes behind him and go to Germany in a gigantic Dornier plane which has been built secretly . It will fly to Moscow , he whispers , with dynamite , gas bombs and liquid fire to destroy the Kremlin . It will also carry enough parachutes , Sir Henri says , to enable a whole army to flutter down as capitalist conquerors . These plans , he thinks , might interest Prosecutor Krylenko in the Moscow trial . But in reality Sir Henri is intensely in earnest about Russia , for he sees the Soviet regime as an open sore poisoning the business health of the world .                    @
