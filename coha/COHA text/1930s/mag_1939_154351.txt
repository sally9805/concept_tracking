But John Henry Lewis , just seven days older but three years wiser in ring experience , is one of the most skilful boxers in the business . He had been defeated only seven times in 99 fights , had never been knocked out , and had successfully defended his world 's light-heavyweight championship against all comers the past three years . <P> There were those who said Champion Joe would carry John Henry a few rounds because they were pals , fellow Negroes . But those who fight Joe nowadays also fight a terrible fear of what he can do to them , and Joe mowed John Henry down in about the time it takes to tee up and drive a golf ball . <P> Who Next ? Most experts now agree that Joe Louis is the greatest fisticuffer of all time , predict that no one will beat him in the next two years-some say five , some say ten . Nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " white hope . " Most promising youngsters discovered since last summer are a pair of Irishmen , Pat Comiskey and Billy Conn , and a Bohemian named Johnny Paychek ( n Pacek ) . Eighteen-year-old Pat Comiskey of Paterson , N. J. has a powerful right-hand punch , has knocked out eight opponents in a row . Pittsburgh 's 6-ft . Billy Conn , 21 and still growing , has a powerful left hook , has defeated five one-time world 's middleweight champions . Johnny Paychek , a Des Moines bellhop , is the hope of the Midwest . Onetime national Golden Gloves champion , sedate , violin-playing Johnny Paychek has won 16 fights ( twelve by knockouts ) since last April . <P> But these up- &-coming; pugilists are at least two years away from heavyweight championship calibre . In the meantime , in order to give customers their money 's worth , one sportswriter suggested that Black-jack Joe take on all current contenders-Lou Nova , Max Baer , Bob Pastor , Tony Galento-in one evening , one at a time , like a barfly 's dream .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
