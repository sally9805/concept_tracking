MY FATHER 'S HOUSE-Pierrepont B. <P> Noyes-Farrar &; Rinehart ( $3.50 ) . <P> Communism was once rife in the U. S. , but not the sort preached by Earl Browder and William Zebulon Foster . A religious , not a political belief , communism was attempted in 62 U. S. communities during the 19th Century , from Massachusetts ' Brook Farm to Indiana 's New Harmony . <P> Strangest of U. S. social experiments , these communist groups are now vaguely remembered as something between a co-operative and a free-love colony . Most suc cessful , most notorious of all communist experiments was the Oneida Community , scene of the " world 's one great experiment in human eugenics . " The subject of many a historical sidelight , Oneida Community last week filled the background of an auto biography written by one of its " eugenic " descendants , whose father , John Humphrey Noyes , founded and led the Community for more than 30 years in the light of " scientific propagation and true Christian Communism . " <P> Graduating from Yale Theological Seminary in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preaching " Perfectionism , " collected a colony of 38 men and 53 women to start off the Oneida venture , which began in a log house in 1847 . Four years later membership had jumped to 205 ( peak membership : 300 ) , and the world was cocking an eye at these scandalous " free lovers " who called their goings-on " stirpiculture . " Within the Community , eugenically weak males struck at the favoritism shown their betters , got a skim-milk ruling that they could father one child . The favored , select , few " stirps " took the cream . Work was planned collectively , law &; order in the same way . Noting the failure of similar groups throughout the country , to make ends meet by straight farming , Noyes and his shrewd , God-fearing colleagues turned to canning fruits and vegetables , manufactured the world-famed Newhouse steel trap , made silk , plated silverware , did a big tourist trade in vegetable dinners . <P> At Author Noyes 's birth Oneida Community , then 22 years old , was a going concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' At walking age he was turned over to the communal nursery-the Drawing Room-was matched for signs of improvement over Outside breeds . His childhood he remembers as a happy time , clouded only with infrequent " criticisms . " Meals were tasty and generous , the Bible was made a friendly , interesting book ; the spacious brick Mansion House , the workshops and farm were rich exploring grounds , the grown-ups gave Gilbert &; Sullivan operas , the children felt important doing part-time work making trap chains . It was not until he was 6 or 7 that he got a taste of Outside opinion from town boys who called them " Christ boys ' ' and " bastards . " In the next few years the Outside closed in savagely . Stirpiculture seemed to the Community 's neighbors no better than turpitude . In 1879 , when Noyes was 9 , his father fled to Canada to escape the clergy 's clamor for his hide . His successor managed badly , quarrels split the Community , and shortly afterward Leader Noyes proclaimed from Canada a New Stirpicultural Policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its course .
