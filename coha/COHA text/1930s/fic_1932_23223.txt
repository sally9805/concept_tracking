THE DEPARTURE A STORY BY SELMA ROBINSON T HE doctor was worried . He shook his head while she spoke to him . " If you thought you recognized the man on the platform why did n't you talk to him ? " he asked . Norah sat fussing with the gardenia on her dark tweed suit . She had explained the whole incident so carefully to him just a moment ago . " I wanted to , but I was afraid to , " she said dully . " Then when I made up my mind , somehow I found myself on the train . And he was left on the platform . He said something to me , but I did n't catch it . " The doctor shook his head again . " There was no man on the platform , " he said . " It is all part of your  --  your sickness . Your trouble . That man existed only in your mind . I know that you are convinced you saw your sweetheart on the elevated platform and heard him say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all part of this illness of your mind . You must believe me . I have seen so many eases like yours . In another three or four months , when you are well , you will see why I am so positive . " She drew a deep , discouraged sigh and prepared to begin all over again with the sharp experience of the past hour . Perhaps if she spoke slowly , carefully " Doctor , you do n't seem to understand at all , " she said . " I imaginednothing . I saw him , I know his face , his gestures . And when you remember that this was to be our wedding day ? He was n't there when I first came out on the platform . I was walking back and forth , back and forth , waiting for the train , and then suddenly I saw him , sitting there , with his bags , packed and strapped , at his feet . He must have come while I had my back turned ? " " I know , I know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third time you 've told me . You noted a strange wild look in his eyes that drew you even though it frightened you . You kept walking back and forth , trying to muster up enough courage to speak to him . You were aware of his eyes staring at you and calling you but you were afraid . And then your train pulled in and you got on . And as it was drawing out of the station you could see his lips moving and you could hear his voice though you could n't understand what he was saying . Is n't that so ? " Norah nodded . " Yes , but my dear girl , your reason must tell you that it is an utter impossibility . Your young man died six months ago . You 've told me so frequently . Dead six months . Now come . Be sensible . How could it have been he ? " She looked hard at the doctor . " You do n't understand yet . To-day would have been our wedding day . We were supposed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was there . Oh , if I only had been brave enough to speak to him , I 'd know what to do now . You ca n't tell me anything , anything at all . " Doctor Waldron took her hand . " My dear girl . I can tell you many things , but you must listen to me . You must believe what I tell you . I understand far better than you . You admit that he died . Yes . You were with him at the end . You attended his funeral . So much you know for a fact . Therefore , since you could n't have seen him on the platform , it must have been a creation of your poor tired mind . You 're tired to-night . There are deep lines under your eyes that I do n't like to see there . In the morning , when you are rested , you will be able to laugh at this difficult day . Naturally , your overwrought condition could n't accept the tragedy that to-day was to have been your wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have dinner with a friend , a good jolly friend who will make you laugh . Then go to the theater . See something amusing . Go somewhere to dance afterward and stay as late as you please . You 'll be so tired that you 'll sleep like a brick . " She smiled at his stupidity . For three months now he had been advising diversion of one sort or another . Why were doctors so stubborn , so stupid ? Every play had a hero and a heroine . A girl and a boy . Kisses . Whispered things . Herself and Ken . Ken . She frowned . In the restaurants the orchestras played love songs . The novels all had love in them . And as for friends , there was no one she knew who had not been a friend of Ken also . It was like tearing the crust off a newly healed wound . But she said to Doctor Waldron : " That 's a good idea . " He patted her hand gently when she said good-night . His face looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but such a fool not to be able to see the plainest things . Out in the street it was almost dark . A row of yellow lights divided the lighter blue of the sky from the darker , more solid blue of the buildings . Traffic filled the Avenue like a rapid , noisy river . People were hurrying , bent over in arcs to withstand the strong November wind . But to her it felt good , washing her face like fresh cold water . She did what she had to do , what she had done every night for the past week . She stopped in to telephone at the first drugstore . Stevens 4-0452 . After a minute , a woman 's voice answered the telephone . That same colorless female voice answered . No-rah remained silent to her querulous hello . The receiver at the other end clicked indignantly into place and the operator 's voice now broke in . Norah said , " I 'm calling Stevens 4-04.52 . " The operator told her she was connected . " But that 's not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm calling Mr. Kenneth Stone . " A few seconds , and the voice of the telephone business office . " I 'm sorry , madame . That telephone is now listed under the name of Susan Weiss . Mr. Stone 's name is no longer listed in our records . " Norah knew , somehow , that it was true . But still , there was no harm . Perhaps if she kept calling he would answer the ' phone some day . It was the same way when she entered the lobby of the New Amsterdam Hotel where they used to meet . To-night he was not among the eager men who were waiting for girls . Nor had he been there last night , nor the nights and nights and nights before that . But to-morrow perhaps he would be there . If she went to enough of the old places and did all the same things , one time she was bound to be lucky , one time he would be there . It did n't take reason to believe that , so of course Doctor Waldron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The whole thing had never occurred to her in those early days after Ken 's death . But now she knew that no one with Ken 's vitality , his hunger for life , for the keen , small things which made each day so exciting , could just die . It was n't natural . But it took a great deal of believing to get it all straight . It was easy to feel discouraged . She felt discouraged again when she reached the street where she lived . Her apartment seemed so high up and the building so stern and heavy . Four windows from the top was her home , twenty stories high . The window was dark . She wished the cleaning woman had sense enough to leave a lamp on . All at once she felt very tired and bloodless . At the desk she asked if there had been any messages . There had been none . In her mail box there was a reminder from her dentist and a blotter from a rug-cleaning place trying to get next spring 's business . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a sharp day . Yes , very sharp , she answered . How funny to be giving and taking worthless words ! What difference could it make ? Cold to-night . Warm to-morrow or next summer . Saying little silly words . She lighted the lamp near the couch , lighted the yellow lamp near the armchair , and gave the wood fire a shove or two with the poker . How tired she was . In the mantel over the fireplace she could see her face when she straightened up . It was pale as the gardenia on her lapel . Her lips , her eyes , and the hollows in her cheek seemed to have been painted by the same dark brush . When she took off her hat , her hair , dark and shiny , lay flat against her head as if it were painted there , too . She remembered a poem Ken had once written her and , though she did n't like poetry , this one seemed lovely and right . It was something about a face like a water lily and hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shudder . It looked so sinister and commanding , so treacherous . And a lost face floating around in it like a water lily , and hair floating about it like seaweed . She sat down in the soft armchair and shut her eyes . The light from the lamp came through her lowered lids , but it was reassuring . When she opened her eyes again and looked toward the couch opposite , she saw Ken sitting there , surveying her with some amusement . His nose was wrinkled in a smile , and light shone on his white teeth . " What are you doing , Norah , posing for a Benda mask ? " he asked . She stared at him , coldness running from her scalp to her feet . " Ken ? Ken ? It 's you ? " " Were you expecting someone else ? " he asked . Then he laughed , and it was like hearing a song she had been trying to remember . " Ken , I ca n't believe it 's you . I ca n't realty believe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed again . " Well , who am I then ? " he demanded . " You 're Ken . You 're Ken , are n't you ? " " Good work , my girl , " said Ken . " But do n't sit there staring at me so , as if I were a ghost . Have n't you a cried , " Ken , darling , " and sprang to him . There was that familiar smell of tobacco and shaving lotion about him . His face was cool , and a lock of hi 's hair as he kissed her slipped out of place and brushed against her eyes . He murmured , " I 've tried so many times to get you . " " Have you , Ken ? " " To-day , on the L station , I thought you 'd stop for a moment and talk to me . Why did n't you ? " Norah said , " Ken , then it was you ! " " Infant ! you 're terribly hard to convince to-night , are n't you ? Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bite a piece out of you the way you ran for that train ? And then later when you telephoned I could hear you talking and I said ' hello , hello . ' But you did n't hear me . And in the New Amsterdam I waved to you but you went past so fast . " Norah looked at him . His eyes , next to hers , looked so big . She smoothed his cheek with her forefinger . " But Ken , " she said , " the doctor told me I was crazy , or something . Oh , Ken , I knew , I knew . If I just kept on I knew you 'd come . " Ken held her away from him for a moment and spoke to her slowly , impressively quiet . " I 've been trying for a long time , Norah . I 'm tired and I ca n't come again . It has been months now . And you must decide this by yourself , without any coercion on my part . Listen to me carefully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what day this is . I have come to get you , but only if you want to go . If you do want to go you must come with me now , at once . You may be frightened . You may even regret it . But I want you to know I ca n't come back again . I have a long , long way to go . " For answer Norah threw her arms around his neck and held him close . " Can I put some things into a bag ? Will you wait ? " Ken laughed . " You silly goose . You wo n't need anything . Come just as you are . " " Ken darling , let 's go . Let 's go quickly . I 'm all ready . " They rose , and Ken took his bags , strapped as they had been earlier in the day . " Promise me you wo n't be frightened ; promise me you 'll do just as I say , Norah . " " I promise , " she said . She followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said , as they raised the window , " When I give you the signal take my arm and let yourself over the sill with me . Do n't be frightened , darling . Just hold on to my arm and shut your eyes and you wo n't mind . I 'll never let you go . " They looked down into the courtyard , twenty stories below . In the oblong of light reflected from the cellar opening they could see Steve , the service man , wheeling an ashcan into the house . Ken motioned her back . " Wait just a minute , " he said . They waited . In the apartments opposite women were in their kitchens preparing dinner . The sounds of pots and china came from the open windows , and little wisps of steam drifted out . Again they looked down . The court was deserted . The light from the cellar was like a tomb-shaped spotlight . She turned to look at Ken . He smiled and nodded his head . " Now , " he said .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
