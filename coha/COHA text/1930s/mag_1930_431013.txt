SOARING over the tropical jungles of Central America a few weeks ago , the man who has become the living symbol of one of the latest phases in human progress looked down upon the crumbling remnants of the oldest American civilization . In twenty-five hours of flying through the sultry air above Honduras , Guatemala , and Yucatan , Colonel Lindbergh , accompanied by Mrs. Lindbergh and scientists of the Carnegie Institution , of Washington , D. C. , discovered ruined cities of the ancient Mayan Empire which could not have been reached by a ground expedition in less than five years . Once more Lindbergh played a trail-blazer 's part . In 1927 , the famous aviator , by his superb flight over the Atlantic , linked two continents . On his recent brief but highly fruitful survey , made at the close of a journey with which he opened the West Indies-South America air-mail route . he established the initial aerial link between the present and the past . For this was the first major archeological exploration ever undertaken from the air . The new method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director of the archeological department of the Carnegie Institution , who served as chief observer on the trip , proved so successful that many similar expeditions are certain to follow . From the cabin of his big amphibian , Colonel Lindbergh and his passengers saw and photographed slender columns of gleaming white rising from the dense jungle growth -- ghostly reminders of an almost forgotten grandeur . They saw the decaying walls of once majestic temples , the remains of imposing pyramids , and in one case a group of twenty-five lofty buildings arranged about a central square . In all , they found the ruins of what centuries ago were four thriving , populous and beautiful cities . And of these , it is believed , three were never before seen by white men . ABOUT a week prior to the start of the Lindbergh tour , Dr. Jose Reygadas , director of archeology for the Mexican government , announced the discovery of a great carved stone terrace amid the ruins of Chichen Itza , the holy city of the Mayas , in Yucatan . The terrace is faced with stone death's-heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mayan kings who , perhaps , were buried surrounded by a wealth of regalia and treasure , much in the manner of the ancient Egyptian pharaohs . Further investigation of the Lindbergh discoveries and of the interior of the supposed royal sepulcher will , archeologists hope , shed new light upon the mystery of the Mayas , the highly civilized race which ruled Central America for centuries before enterprising Europeans , in quest of gold and power , discovered the " New " World . Much of their history and evidence of their amazing culture have come to light in recent years , principally through the efforts of Dr. Herbert J. Spinden , curator of  | ethnology of the Brooklyn Museum , and formerly connected with the Peabody Museum , Harvard University ; Dr. Sylvanus G. Morley and other scientists of the Carnegie Institution ; Thomas W. F. Gann , the British archeologist , and Gregry Mason , the American journalist-explorer . But the investigators are well aware that their present knowledge forms but a fraction of what remains unknown . With records cut in imperishable stone , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on August 6 , 613 B.C. On that remote day ? the oldest date in American history ? they put into operation a workable and astonishingly accurate calendar system which has been the marvel of the scientific world since it was deciphered . Why on August 6 , 613 B.C. ? Where were the Mayas on August 5 ? Had they lived , tilled the soil , developed their wonderful astronomy and admirable architecture , pursued their other arts and : iences on this continent before they carved that first inscription ? If so , for t. . w long ? If not , whence did they come ? Nobody knows . Step by step , along trails of tangible remains , science has been able to trace the evolution of the Egyptians and other ancient peoples back to their earliest and crudest beginnings . But not so in the case of the Mayas . So far as any concrete evidence is concerned , they might as well have dropped down from Mars or some other planet on the morning of that sixth day of August 2,542 years ago . Toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the decline of Rome had begun , the first Mayan Empire began a cultural development that was to culminate in a period of brilliant achievement from about AD. 300 to 600 But then , at the height of its power and glory , the empire suddenly collapsed . Within approximately fifty years , the magnificent cities with their monumental temples , sculptured and jeweled dpalaces , astronomical observatories and , probably , thousands of dwellings grouped about the edifices of worship and public business , were abandoned . Soon they were covered by the tropical forest as completely as though the earth itself had opened up and swallowed them . What happened ? What catastrophe befell this race , so sturdy in body , so keen in mind ? Did it fall victim to a suicidal civil war ? Did its food supply suddenly give out ? Or was it decimated by some devastating epidemic ? Experts say yellow fever probably had much to do with the dramatic decline . But nobody really knows . After three lean centuries , during which the Mayas surviving the collapse settled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Second Empire . But , though they succeeded once more in achieving a measure of prosperity and of artistic and scientific accomplishment , the glory and splendor of the first great period were never quite recaptured . And when the Spaniards came in 1519 , the old grandeur was a mere memory . So much , in brief , for the mysterious rise and fall of the Mayas . Should the Lindbergh finds and the presumed " tomb of the kings " at Chichen Itza yield the answer to the riddle of their origin , another problem might also be solved ? the question of how they came by their remarkable cultural attainments . THE Mayas were the Greeks of the Vest . As architects , they were the inventors of the skyscraper , for their temples and other structures , though usually consisting of not more than two or three and , in rare cases , five stories , rose to a height of 200 feet ? the equivalent of eighteen-story modern buildings . Moreover , they were the originators of the " step-back " or " set-back " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business towers . Although their architecture did not equal that of the Egyptians , the Greeks , or the Romans , yet their edifices have largely resisted the ravage of 1,500 years or more in a destructive climate . In painting and sculpture they are considered the superiors of the Egyptianstheir weirdly beautiful feathered-serpent column , for example , is unique in the world of art . Their elevated stone roads have proved better time-defiers than those of the Romans . And while their extraordinary system of hieroglyphic writing -- a sort of pictorial shorthand consisting of abbreviated pictures of the objects to be described ? was involved and cumbersome in comparison with the Roman and Greek alphabets , at least it was as serviceable as that of the Egyptians . At the zenith of its power , the Mayan Empire was a thriving nation of some 14,000,000 prosperous and comparatively enlightened people of whom , by the way , just a few thousand poor and ignorant Indians are the present descendants . It took much beside lovely buildings , skillful carvings , and pretty pictures to maintain that great body of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous as the population of New York State today . They were thorough-going farmers , efficient busi- nessmen , and artisans of an advanced culture . Along trade routes comparing favorably with those of the ancient Phoenicians and Sumerians , Mayan merchants imported pearls from Colombia and turquoise from distant New Mexico , and exported their native pottery and woven textiles in exchange . AS AGRICULTURALISTS , the Mayas probably surpassed most of their farming contemporaries across the Atlantic . Their cultivation was intensive ; their crops were widely diversified . To them the modern Loa owes its corn , potatoes , sweet potatoes , ma a and kidney beans , cocoa , cotton , tobacco and a host of other cereals , vegetables and fruits , as well as a number of medicinal plants , including quinine , cocaine , and cascara sagrada . They were the first planters of rubber and the discoverers of chicle , which forms the basis of chewing gum . They originated the custom of sowing squash between hills of corn , and beans between rows of corn hills . In many other ways the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of concrete in the construction of buildings . It appears that they erected wooden forms against which were laid blocks of stone , cut smooth in front only , to serve as a facing . Then a mixture of crushed rock and liquid mortar was poured into the space between the facing and the inner wooden form . This produced a strong monolithic wall . In their painting , they embodied the principles of perspective and foreshortening , and even developed a certain technique in presenting a three-quarters view . And devotees of the Sunday comics may be surprised to learn that the Mayas , in their carvings of human figures in conversation , originated the " speech-balloon " without which no modern " funny " is complete . SOME of the Mayan domestic arrangements , too , were quite " up-to-date . " On a certain day corresponding somewhat to our New Year 's , a period resembling a modern " cleanup week " was inaugurated . For thirteen days every Maya was compelled to clean , repaint and renew his house from top to bottom and renovate all furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjected to a thorough cleaning-up process , supervised by the priests who were required to fast during the thirteen days . The close of the house-cleaning period was celebrated by the lighting of new fires upon the altars and general feasting in which , it may be imagined , the priests took a more than academic interest . Among the Mayas the women did most of the farm work ? no mean job when it is realized that they had no draft animals ? and so it is safe to assume that the chores of " clean-up week " were also left to them . If the Mayan men were anything like the husbands of today , they probably were out on the tennis courts while their wives were scrubbing , painting and polishing . For in the realm of sport also the Mayas were innovators . They enjoyed a game closely akin to squash or tennis , in which rubber balls were knocked back and forth across a court with the ancient equivalent of a racket . Only last year , Dr. Frans Blom , of Tulane University , New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yucatan . Although estimated to be 2,000 years old , the courts were in excellent repair . Medicine was at a low ebb though there is evidence that the Mayas knew how to trepan skulls , and also may have had a knowledge of anesthesia . Dentistry of a sort was practised by Mayan surgeons , as evidenced by the discovery of teeth that were filed to fine points and others with fillings of shiny iron pyrites . In all likelihood ,  | however , this early American dental work was performed for no reason other than to " improve " the patient 's appearance . But in no field of endeavor were the Mayas far ahead of their time as in , mathematics astronomy . And it was because of their amazing command of these sciences that they were able to work out a calendar system which accuracy equals and even surpasses our own . JANUARY 1 , 1930 , the Soviet government of Russia introduces a new calendar featured by a five-day week . The year will have the usual twelve months , each consisting six of the short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be devoted to national festivals . In America , George Eastman , the camera manufacturer , and other prominent business men are urgin the adoption of a thirteen-month calendar . ( P. S. M. , June ' 29 , p. 32 . ) The Russians , however , did not invent the five-day week nor did the notion of a thirteen-month year originate in the United States . Long before the beginning of the Christian era , the ancient Mayas had developed and were using both . According to Dr. Spinden , the Mayas probably first had a lunar-solar calendar of twelve months of thirty days each , making a year of 360 days . But , instead of turning the five " loose " days into holidays , like the Soviet calendar reformers , they made them into an extra , short thirteenth month . Later , the days of the month were reduced to twenty and the number of months increased to eighteen . This thes Mayas did to make their calendar correspond to their system of counting , which was based upon the number twenty ? the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra month , of course , had to be ned . Although the Mayan day-count was not put operation until August 6 , 613 B.C. , the as projected time back to a date corresponding to October 14 , 3373 B.C. , which they considered the beginning of the world . So . rate was their calendar that from the time as put into actual use until A.D. 1561 , when fanatical Spaniards destroyed most of the books and chronicles of the Mayan Empire , . id not err to the extent of a single day . The Julian calendar , which was used in southern - ape until 1582 and in Russia until a few years ago , made the year twelve minutes too and accumulated an error of 11 days in less than 2,000 years . The ancient Mayan calendar , Dr. Spinden told me the other day , could have run for 300,000 years before it would have accumulated an error of one day . Our present calendar will run only 3,300 years before it gets to be one day wrong . BY MEANS of an intricate system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day within a calendar round of Fifty-two years , the unit in which they kept their records . Besides , they created a " long runt , " in which they reckoned the lapse of - : rue from the initial point ? October 14 , Z373 B.C. In this long count they measured rime by " kins , " or days ; " unials " of twenty lays ; " tuns , " or years of 360 days ; " katuns " of twenty years , and " baktuns " of 400 years . In addition , they also used a " great cycle , " but it has not been established with certainty whether this consisted of 5,200 or 8,000 years . Dr. Spinden , who has made fifteen trips of exploration in the Maya country and devoted years to the work of correlating the Mayan calendar with our own , explained to me the psychology underlying the Mayan time-count . " The idea of the immensity of space and time , " he said , " seems to have got into the very soul of the Mayas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | diary . They gave the days names and numbers not only to distinguish them in long stretches of time , but also to endow them with a personality . Thus , there were good days , bad days and indifferent days . Naturally , our mode of thinking about time is so entirely different and so impersonal and abstract , that it is a bit difficult to understand exactly what the Mayas tried to do . They attempted to reduce time to a point where it became more or less concrete and tangible . In other words , they wanted to feel ' time and I , for one , am almost sure they could . Incidentally , Mayas had to be past middle age to have a chance to observe their birthdays , for the same day came back only once every fifty-two years . " THE Mayas ' marvelous knowledge of the movements of the heavenly bodies was chiefly the result of their invention of what might be called " lensless astronomy . " They had , of course , no telescopes . A few years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institution , who was a member of Lindbergh 's party on his recent flight , discovered that a round tower amid the ruins of Chichen Itza had been used by the Mayas as an astronomical observatory . To make observations of the stars and the planets , they used slits or windows cut through the walls of this tower at " strategic " points . By making careful note of the particular opening through which the sun shone at high noon , the observers were enabled to fix the dates of the spring equinox , the summer solstice and the autumnal equinox . Thus , the Mayan system of astronomy was , in a manner , the reverse of that used by modern astronomers . Instead of gazing at the heavenly bodies , they let the sun and stars " look " at them . The knowledge gained in this manner was used by the priest-scientists to inform the rural population of the proper seasons at which to plow , sow , reap and perform other agrarian duties . The astronomical observatory was an improvement over an earlier method in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a temple past monuments at the sun . The Mayas were undoubtedly the best astronomers of ancient times . IN the realm of mathematics the Mayas , too , were vastly superior to all of their contemporaries . They invented the idea of zero 1,000 years before it was conceived by the Hindus , who passed it on to the Arabs and , through them , to the Europeans . The Mayas were intensely religious . Like the Romans , they had a pantheon of many gods , a priesthood and a sisterhood the members of which were pledged to celibacy , and the institution of the confession of sins . Peaceloving and apparently extremely trusting , none of their magnificent cities was fortified . The Spaniards who , in the beginning of the sixteenth century , " discovered " the strange Mayan country and its people , were also religious in the extreme . Unfortunately their priests , in their excessive zeal to stamp out the Mayan " works of the devil , " destroyed most of their wonderful ancient lore . Only three books survive the bonfires of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' intricate inscriptions , science patiently has pieced together a story as fascinating and romantic as any which the history of the human race affords . But several chapters of this beautiful story are missing . Perhaps Colonel Lindbergh 's discoveries and the find of the Mexican archeologists will provide the world with the solution of the mystery of the Mayas ' origin and tragic passing .  |
