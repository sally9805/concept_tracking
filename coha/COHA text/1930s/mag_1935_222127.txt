Lewis Baker Warren entered Yale 's Sheffield Scientific School in 1906 , studied electrical engineering , got mediocre grades . Those who knew the tall , handsome lad with the blue eyes and dark hair thought him a great fellow , believed he had a good future . At the end of the year he made a Sheff club , York Hall , and a fraternity , Chi Phi . But because he was shy and sickly , he took part in no sports , remained unknown to most of his classmates . In 1908 Lewis Baker Warren was too ill to return to Yale . In 1912 he died . <P> Lewis Warren had come of old Colonial stock , both sides of his family boasting ancestors who barely missed the Mayflower . As early as 1914 his father , Charles Howard Warren , socialite treasurer of the billion-dollar Mutual Life Insurance Co. of New York , gave Yale a scholarship for some boy like his late son . In 1924 he obtained Yale 's promise to accept more such scholarships when he died . Surprised was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died in November , had left it not two or three more scholarships but an estate estimated at $1,000,000 , big enough to grant nearly 100 scholarships each year . <P> In minute detail Mr. Warren had drawn the picture of the type of boy to whom the Warren scholarships should go : " Beneficiaries shall be boys of qualifications , antecedents and traditions similar to those possessed by my son . They are not to be chosen on the basis of scholarship rating but primarily because they will be adjudged to be boys of high character , possessed of attractive personality , gifts of leadership and of promise for future usefulness . ... I wish each award to serve not only as a memorial to my son but to the Anglo-Saxon race , to which the United States owes its culture . ... I direct that such beneficiaries shall be confined to those boys who shall be ... the sons of white Christian parents of Anglo-Saxon , Scandinavian or Teutonic descent , both of whom are citizens of the United States and were born in America .
