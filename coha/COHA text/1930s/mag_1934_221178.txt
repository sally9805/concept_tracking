WOMEN MUST WORK-Richard Aldington-Doubleday , Doran ( $2.50 ) . <P> The two waves of poetry and war have washed up much flotsam and some rare finds on literature 's beach . A poet and a War veteran , Richard Aldington is neither trash nor treasure but an excellent example of a soundly second-rate writer . A poet by trade , Author Aldington has lately turned to satirical novels whose unenlightened realism makes good reading for those who like their humdrum with a seasoning of malice . Since English Author Aldington puts only his own countrymen in his pillory portraits , U. S. readers can gaze on them with a certain equanimity . Latest Aldington exhibit is the Emancipated Female , British style . <P> Etta did not so much believe in woman 's rights as in her own . As daughter of the house in a stuffy Edwardian provincial town , she was expected to remain a dutiful child until she became a no less dutiful wife . Etta had what she thought were less middle-class ideas . When her parents refused to fall in line , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stenography saved her from starvation , and a lucky encounter with a Lady Bountiful gave her a social secretary 's job on easy street . A rich young socialite fell in love with her , and Etta leaned the same way herself , but she was a little too cautious to let go entirely . The War separated them , gave Etta another boost up the economic ladder . On his first leave Etta was prepared to give him all , but at the last minute her finer feelings overcame her . When they met again , it was too late , she was about to have a baby by a middle-aged barrister , whom Etta had tricked into fatherhood . Her post-War progress was rapid ; she became a smart businesswoman , made a pile , finally completed the furnishing of her house by purchasing a young gigolo husband .
