Many Britons who had thought that newly installed Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was barren of humor changed their minds last week . Before the wildly cheering House of Commons in his first speech as the nation 's leader , " The Unknown " Chamberlain not for the first time revealed a flair for the sardonic. * Of retired Stanley Baldwin he said : " His love of truth wavered only occasionally , when , with a deceit which soon ceased to deceive anybody he was wont to describe himself as a plain , ordinary man . . . . Many comparisons have been made between Baldwin and other great Prime Ministers . For my part I have often thought that , making all due allowance for differences of education and upbringing and country , he comes nearest to Abraham Lincoln . " <P> Stanley Baldwin having been disposed of , the House got down to business . Up for discussion came the tax on growth of profits proposed by Neville Chamberlain in his Budget Speech ( TIME , May 3 ) . Leveled at Britain 's fattened armament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual revenue of $125,000,000 toward the cost of the Government 's $7,500,000,000 five-year armament plan . <P> Almost to a man the Prime Minister 's Conservative Party cracked down on the tax . It was described as " monstrous , " as " the most disastrous proposal any government has put forward since the War . " Only one Government supporter praised the measure-Sir John Simon , who as newly appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer had to speak well of it . Neville Chamberlain was in the unenviable position of being opposed by the Party of which he had been appointed leader that very day . <P> All successful British politicians know how to make a virtue of retreat . Next day a contrite Prime Minister rose to his feet , declared : " I do not think I have ever been inclined to show a pig-headed obstinacy . " Neville Chamberlain withdrew his tax . He said that Treasury experts were working on a " simpler " corporate profits levy. * <P> Government supporters shouted themselve hoarse . Business leaders whooped with joyous relief . Telegrams praising the Prime Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poured into No. 10 Downing Street . Stock Exchange prices , especially of base metals , shot upward . Neville Chamberlain had no cause to regret his " commonsense attitude . " <P> *In early 1933 during the U. S. banking crisis , Britons waited anxiously for some clue to their Government 's financial policy . Over Chancellor of the Exchequer Neville Chamberlain 's signature a letter appeared in the London Times , and the country devoured it eagerly . Excerpts : " It may be of interest to record that in walking through St. James 's Park today I noticed a grey wagtail . . . . Probably the occurrence of this bird in the heart of London has been recorded before , but I have not myself previously noted it in the Park . P.S. . . . I mean a grey wagtail and not a pied . " <P> *Opinion in London was that this would be a tax of about 4% on profits not only of corporations but of private concerns also , possibly including such professional persons as lawyers , accountants .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
