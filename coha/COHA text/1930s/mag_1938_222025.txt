To one man on Long Island , the hurricane which devastated Fire Island and the continuing strip of seabeach that runs as far east as Southampton ( TIME , Oct. 3 ) spelled Opportunity as well as Catastrophe . He was husky , dark-haired , immensely energetic Robert Moses . <P> A Republican , he is friendly with both Mayor LaGuardia 's Fusion administration in New York City and the Democratic State administration , both of which he serves ( as president of the Long Island State Park Commission and City Park Commissioner ) . No friend , however , of Franklin Roosevelt and Harold Ickes with whose money he built the Triborough Bridge , Mr. Moses is a favorite with Greater New Yorkers . In the last 17 years he has , almost singlehanded , obtained for them more and better parks and parkways than they had obtained in 50 years previous . <P> These include : the great Jones Beach ( where 130,000 bathers can throw horseshoes , pitch-putt-golf , listen to opera , row their babies on South Oyster Bay or diaper them in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " under free instruction facilities ) ; Jacob Riis Park ( which has the world 's largest one-unit parking space - 14,000 cars ) ; Orchard Beach on Pelham Bay ( where 100,000 bathers can cavort on 6,600,000 cu . yd. of ocean sand of which 2,500,000 was hauled from Rockaway ) ; Bethpage Park ( where the near-rich can play polo and all can play golf on four 18-hole courses for $1 and $2 greens fees ) ; seven other public golf courses ; 161 City tennis courts ; 250 City playgrounds ; 233 miles of motor parkways . Due to his efforts , Greater New York , long backward , has probably the biggest , most elaborate recreation facilities of any U. S. city , and many of them are self-supported by moderate fees for bathing , parking , charcoal at the fireplaces provided for picnickers. * Mr. Moses has long had in mind making a public promised land of Long Island 's whole south shore . Owners and renters opposed him , preferring their beaches to remain wildly beautiful , to keep city hordes from encroaching further on country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flinders , with even their beach , real estate so devastated that many an owner thought of letting it go in default of taxes , this opposition was silenced . Last week Park-Builder Moses urged upon the Suffolk County Board of Supervisors a sweeping plan which combined security for landowners with beauty and utility for the general public . <P> Give him two years and $15,500,000 ( of which Suffolk County need raise only $10,500,000 ) , said Mr. Moses , and he would ( see map ) : <P> 1 ) Construct a 43-mile bulkhead motor highway , part parkway , part boulevard well above high-tide line the length of the sandspit from Fire Island State Park to Southampton . <P> 2 ) Dredge sand for this roadbed so as to make a new boat channel in the lee of the sandspit straight through Great South , Moriches and Shinnecock Bays ( like a channel already dredged from Fire Island Inlet west to Jones Inlet ) . <P> 3 ) Create three new State park areas along this ocean parkway . <P> 4 ) Connect the main island to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
