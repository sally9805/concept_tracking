In Manhattan 's Columbus Hospital Extension , 16 years ago , an hour-old infant lay near death . A nurse , later adjudged to have been " tired , " had bathed his eyes with the wrong solution of silver nitrate , 50% instead of 1% , which had blinded him , seared his cheeks with deep furrows , and with its fumes caused pneumonia . Though his doctor had given the infant up as hopeless , a Missionary Sister of the Sacred Heart , which maintained the hospital , obtained the doctor 's permission to pin on the babe 's clothing a medal of Mother Frances Xavier Cabrini , founder of the Sacret Heart Order . <P> Within 72 hours the infant 's blackened eyes were healed , his pneumonia gone , his cheeks unscarred .

Peter Smith 's " wonder , " cited as a reason why the Catholic Church should make a saint of Mother Cabrini. last week helped advance her one step on the long road to canonization . In the Vatican , Pope Pius XI and his Congregation of Rites approved the " heroic virtues " of the energetic , well-born nun , directed that she be called " Venerable . " <P> Before Mother Cabrini may be beatified , with the title " Blessed , " two or more new miracles must be performed through her intercession . Since the Church in its investigations must winnow authentic " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hysteria , or self-hypnosis , and even well-meaning fraud , the reputation of the candidate must become widespread so that thousands of faithful may actively pray for miracles to happen . Last week an organization called the Cabrini Cavaliers , formed last year , made ready to seek 100,000 petitioners for Mother Cabrini 's early canonization.
