Peppery-smelling incense swirled one day last week in a fusty house of God in uptown Manhattan . Built 35 years ago with funds given by Tsar Nicholas II of Russia , the Cathedral of St. Nicholas , archiepiscopal seat of the North American continent , has never since been repaired . But bravely beneath its crumbling ceiling and rain-stained murals stood Russian prelates in vestments of gilt studded with imitation jewels , crying : " Axios ! Axios ! " ( Worthy ! Worthy ! ) , as Archbishop Nicholas Kedroff , head of the North American branch of the Russian Orthodox Church , bestowed a bishop 's cassock , pectoral image , mantle , cowl and rosary upon Rt . Rev. Damaskinos Demessianos . Bishop Damaskinos was appointed by the Holy Synod of Russia to the Orthodox see of San Francisco . The handful of his friends and worshipers at his investiture were outnumbered by news cameramen popping flash bulbs . <P> Chin-bearded Bishop Damaskinos , born 50 years ago in Corfu and educated in Greece , earned the bishopric of San Francisco by doing able work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the jurisdiction of the Soviet-dominated Metropolitan Sergius in Russia , has a U. S. hierarchy of only five . Ten years ago it had to go to court to win title to the dilapidated cathedral whose 500 parishioners-400 of whom are now on relief rolls-have never had money to refurbish . In better shape is the newer , autonomous Russian Orthodox Church of North America , which has three archbishops , seven bishops . 300,000 communicants , and takes no orders from Russia . <P> <P> Other new U. S. bishops of the past fortnight : <P> Syracuse , N , Y. , with 200,000 Catholics , got a new shepherd when Rev. Walter Andrew Foery was consecrated in nearby Rochester , where he was born 47 years ago and where for 21 years he was a parish priest . Lean , pale , serious , Bishop Foery was consecrated by Archbishop Edward Francis Mooney . lately of Rochester , now of Detroit ( TIME , Aug. 16 ) . Co-consecrators were Bishop Francis P. Keough of Providence and Bishop Emmet Michael Walsh of Charleston , both his classmates at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake City , whose 10,000 Catholics were guided by Bishop James Edward Kearney until he was transferred to Rochester to succeed Archbishop Mooney , the Pope appointed Monsignor Duane Garrison Hunt , 52 , vicar general of the diocese . Born of Methodists in Reynolds , Neb. , he went to Cornell , was converted to Catholicism in 1912 , became professor of public speaking at the predominantly Mormon University of Utah a year later . In 1935-36 Monsignor Hunt was the weekly speaker on NBC 's Catholic Hour . <P> To succeed Auxiliary Bishop Joseph H. Albers of Cincinnati , transferred last month to the new diocese of Lansing , Mich. , the Pope chose Monsignor George J. Rehring , 47 , longtime professor and present rector of Mount St. Mary Seminary .
