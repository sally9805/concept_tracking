txt Cabinet , Reluctant to Take Hand on Continent , Driven by Need to Uphold Prestige . ARMS ISSUE AN EXAMPLE It Is Held the Nation Would Be Imperiled by Isolation Without Vast Defense . By AUGUR . fiDeei.1 Correcponderr , e , TErs NEW YORK TIMES . LONDON . Dec. ** without the power to defend it is a dangerous possession . Here , in a nutshell , is Great Britain 's problem today . The British attitude toward Europe is dominated by it , for , if British prestige on the old Continent is destroyed , nothing can save the accumulated wealth of the country , and its potential growth in the future as well , from raiding by the poorer European nations . Imperialists and partisans of isolation speak about a withdrawal behind the Chinese wall of a self-contained British Empire . The cry goes up : leave Europe to her own devices . But isolation within the empire . admitting for the sake of argument that it is possible , means that the United Kingdom immediately finds itself placed in a dangerous geographical position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the empire , and the citadel of its defense , it is situated on the border , in the immediate neighborhood of an aggressive Europe . What Isolation Would Mean . ' So isolation from Europe in the manner suggested means that to protect its wealth Britain would be obliged to have an unchallengeable supremacy in armaments . British statesmen , therefore , have always felt that it is to their advantage , and certainly cheaper in the long run , to dominate European affairs from within , by taking part in them and by drawing the power necessary not so much from physical force as from the moral prestige obtained through a skillful handling of the political situation . Joseph Chamberlain was in his day the inspirer of British imperial policy . He always said that to be strong within the empire it was necessary to be powerful at home . To be strong in the colonies was useless , he contended , if the central power went into a. decline . Here we have the key to the reasons that drive the British Government , much against its inclination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions on the Continent . Take , for example , the problem of disarmament . The Cabinet has . put off a decision on this point innumerable times so that the officials of the diplomatic service have been positively driven to despair . Still the problem continually comes back , demanding a Cabinet decision . On Jan. 10 the Ministers will meet again after their Christmas holiday . They will have to listen to the report of Sir John Simon , the Foreign Secretary , on the results of his conversations in Paris and in Rome . The majority in the Cabinet again would like to shelve any decision , but the meeting of the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference in Geneva has been fixed for the third week in January . Time is short and instructions must be drafted for the British delegates . Will the Cabinet once again defer action ? If it does so , its prestige at home is likely to receive a serious blow . Now there is one thing that can be said about the British people without any possibility of doubt : they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hope to preserve its prestige among its own people if it does not allow itself to be guided by the democratic principle . As a result of this , British policy abroad must necessarily favor countries with a mentality similar to its own . The Franco-British Link . Here we have the true reason of the extraordinary solidity of the link that unites Britain and France . The two nations are dissimilar in their tastes ; their conceptions of life are entirely different ; they have a talent for antagonizing each other . Still they stick together all the time . The explanation of this political phenomenon , apart from material considerations , is in the fact that British and French alike remain intensely democratic in a Europe full of dictatorships of every possible kind . Sir John Simon 's visit to Paris again has served to bring to light the parallelism of the ways followed by the two democracies . It sufficed for the French to assert their faith in the method of international government as expressed in the covenant of the League of Nations for the British Foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harnessed with Prance In the difficult job of settling Europe 's most pressing problems , the British Government likes to remain on terms of a good relationship with other States , and especially with Italy , a country with which the United Kingdom has many interests in common and virtually none in contradiction . But of late Italian policy has fallen upon difficult times . The Germans try to spread the impression that they have been able to tie Premier Mussolini to them by a definite diplomatic convention with regard to a common front on the subject of disarmament . ? Knowing the skill of Roman diplomacy , the writer prefers to believe that at best an agreement may have been made for consultation from Case to case , as it arises , and withOut any irrevocable commitment . However that may be , it is certain that , probably for tactical reasons . Italian tactics have been often employed to help the German Government out of the difficult situations in which it becomes continually involved through the methods of its diplomats and politicians . It is probable also tha ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the policy of the French , who still find it difficult to treat their Italian cousins as they deserve , that is , as a great power in riurope.
