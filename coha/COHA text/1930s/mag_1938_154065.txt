Lady of Le Mars <P> For a decade the citizens of placid little Le Mars , Iowa ( pop . 4,700 ) have been puzzled by the goings on of tall , statuesque Mrs. Maybelle Trow Knox . Her neighbors knew she was the daughter of a Civil War veteran , who left her enough money to amass a valuable collection of antiques and a reputed fortune in unmounted gems . She queened it over a household composed of her aged mother , Mrs. Lucinda Trow , and her half-cousin and husband , Sumner Knox , a mild little man who had been a mail clerk , later worked in the county relief office . <P> As county chairman of the W. C. T. U. in the 1920s she had led a series of violent raids until she was sued for smashing up a soft-drink parlor . She was also imprisoned for a year for trying to collect $10,000 on a forged note from the estate of an eccentric Le Mars lawyer named T. M. Zink . This year Mrs. Knox knocked out the teeth of a relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off of Sumner Knox . When neighbors began to note the absence of Mr. Knox and Mrs. Trow , Le Mars grew suspicious . <P> More suspicious than most were two reporters from the Le Mars semiweekly Globe-Post , who tried to get a picture of 91-year-old Mrs. Trow on Election Day , were refused . When they returned with policemen and broke into the house , they found Mrs. Knox ill in bed , no trace of her mother . Mrs. Knox told the sheriff that her mother was on a trip , that she had hired a woman to impersonate her . She had been collecting her mother 's $40 monthly Civil War pension . Pressed , Mrs. Knox said Mrs. Trow had gone to Nebraska with a friend named Ed Roach . <P> In Nebraska City , Ed Roach said he had visited Mrs. Knox after she wrote a matrimonial letter describing herself as " 37 , unmarried and attractive , " was frightened off when she interviewed him in a black silk evening gown amid her antiques . <P> He had not seen her since . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , police took spades and unearthed an old kitchen cabinet . Inside , wrapped in a black shroud , were the remains of Mrs. Lucinda Trow , buried about six months . Then police reported that they had found in Abel , la. a decree , dated 1934 , purporting to divorce Maybelle Trow from Sumner Knox . <P> So Mrs. Knox was arrested on the charge of forging her mother 's endorsement to pension checks , but she refused to believe her mother was dead , could not explain the whereabouts of Sumner Knox . When a State detective tried to snatch a letter from her , powerful Mrs. Knox jerked his arm so hard that she broke a knitting fracture in his neck . Her lawyer announced : " She wants the public to feel that she is at least halfway human-not at all the monster that idle rumor has made of her . "
