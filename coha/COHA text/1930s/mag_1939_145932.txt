&gt; Last week John Barbirolli , conductor of the New York Philharmonic , who is not generally considered a magician so far as programs are concerned , pulled an exciting Easter rabbit out of his hat . Assisted by the young , well-trained Westminster Choir of Princeton , N. J. , the Philharmonic gave Manhattan an earful of Gioachino Antonio Rossini 's rare Petite Messe Solennelle ( Little Solemn Mass ) , which is neither little nor solemn . The Mass took almost two hours to perform , was full of the impish but not impious gaiety of Rossini 's comic operas ( Ceneventola , The Barber of Seville ) . Rossini , one of the laziest and wittiest of all composers , wrote his Solemn Mass in 1863 at the age of 71 , called it his " last mortal sin , " marked one passage Allegro Cristiano ( quick but Christian ) , confessed he did not know whether it was " musique sacre ou sacre musique " ( sacred or accursed music ) , made one tenor solo , Domine Deus , sound like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sung by " three sexes-men , women and eunuchs . " The Westminster Choir got along all right with the first two . <P> &gt; Largest and swankiest spa in England is the venerable town of Bath , 107 miles from London . Bath 's principal claims to fame are its Roman remains , its Georgian house-fronts , and its spring water . Gouty Britishers have drunk and dunked themselves in Bath 's water since the time of the Roman Empire . Not so well known as Bath 's baths , but no less remarkable , is Bath 's Pump Room Orchestra , a small 18-man group , which is today the oldest established orchestra in the British Empire . <P> Founded by England 's famous dandy and fashion arbiter , Richard ( " Beau " ) Nash , the Pump Room Orchestra ( now conducted by handsome Maurice Miles ) has given concerts in Bath 's Pump Room for 234 uninterrupted years . Last week word leaked out that the famous Pump Room Orchestra was to be disbanded . Reason : for its size , Bath 's orchestra had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's expected deficit : $25,000.
