With the Presidential special standing in Washington 's Union Station one evening last week-puffing , impatient to be off with Mr. Roosevelt to Hyde Park- General Johnson in a few hours put across three big deals : wangled codes out of the lumber , steel and oil industries . Thus was a grave deadlock broken , the first major industries ( aside from textiles ) brought under the code provision of the Recover Act . <P> First of the three codes to be pushed through to Presidential signature was lumber . It did not stop with providing a 40-hr , maximum week ( extensible to 48 hr. at seasonal peaks ) and wages of 40 an hour . It provided that the industry should undertake forest conservation measures ( details to be worked out in co-operation with the Administration ) . Biggest of all it set up a " Lumber Code Authority Inc. " which will 1 ) estimate consumption , work out production quotas ; 2 ) set minimum prices so that no lumber products may be sold below cost . Dr. Wilson Compton , manager of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet a " cordial reception " in the industry . <P> No such reception was waiting for the steel and oil codes . The President 's own persuasion was used to help wangle the steel code . U.S. Steel 's Myron C. Taylor and Bethlehem 's Charles M. Schwab spent an hour on the carpet in the White House . They emerged rather grimly , refused so much as a word to newshawks . One determined correspondent took Mr. Taylor 's lapel , cried : " You 'd better come clean . We 're stockholders in your company . " <P> Said Mr. Taylor : " Congratulations " Said Mr. Schwab ( who has in recent years faced angry stockholders at Bethlehem Steel meetings ) : " Congratulations , Mr. Taylor , on meeting some of your stockholders . " <P> Said Mr. Taylor , shrugging : " This is n't a stockholders ' meeting " <P> The morning before he lumber code was finished General Johnson got the steel men into a room , kept them there for twelve hours with only a brief intermission for dinner-virtually whipped them into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shaking their heads grievously . He had beaten down their demand for continuance of open shop. * The code provided a maximum 40-hr. week ( extensible to 48 hr. at seasonal peaks ) ; a minimum 40 an hour wage ; an eight-hour day effective after Nov. 1 if the industry is operating at 60% or more of capacity ; three representatives of the NRA to see that steel obeys its code . Gloomily accepting these provisions the steelmasters agreed that the code should go into effect for 90 days to determine its effect .
