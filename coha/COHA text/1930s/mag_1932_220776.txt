Migrating monkeys swarmed screeching into the Viceregal Capital of New Delhi last week , disturbed the repose of Their Excellencies the Viceroy and Lady Willingdon , made more trouble for the police than do St. Gandhi 's non-violent Nationalists . Treating the monkeys exactly like Gandhites , police riot squads drove them out of town with lathis ( long staves ) every day . But every night the monkeys crept back to plague New Delhi , caused the United Press to report that " monkeys dominated the city . " <P> Legally dominant , the Viceroy demanded that New Delhi 's Municipal Council do something about the monkeys . They could , one Councilman proposed , be penned up in wire enclosures ( like Gandhites ) . The Council called this scheme " impractical , " temporized , waited to see if Nature would not tell the monkeys to get on with their migration .
