Many scientists accept the theory that sunlight influences conception and hence that Eskimos are sterile during the long Arctic nights . In last week 's Science , Zoologist Wayne L. Whitaker of the University of Michigan rose to defend Eskimo potency . Analysis of all the births in West Greenland between the years 1901 and 1930 shows that more conceptions occurred in April , the first month of spring , and December , the Eskimos ' visiting season , than in any other months . His conclusions : 1 ) whatever sexual debility may have been observed by early explorers is probably due to famine during the lone , cruel winter , rather than lack of light : 2 ) " it seems unwise to consider the possibility of the existence of definitely limited seasons of reproduction in other human groups . . . since much of the published material available is based on inadequate data .
