HE idea of collective living gives most 1 Americans an emotional fright . It suggests a cross between a college reunion and a summer camp , held together by a concept lifted out of the agricultural program of the Soviet Union . Nowadays the reaction of the average person is almost determined , in fact , by whether he is friendly or unfriendly to the Soviets . This is silly but no doubt inevitable , because the Soviets ? and the Mexicans with their ejidos ? are the only peoples experimenting with collective living on a large scale . But they are doing nothing new . The reader familiar with history will know that the idea is as old as civilization , that it was an animating principle of early Christian communities , that collective living was widespread in the Middle Ages . Before I tried the experiment of living collectively my only attitude toward it was one of tolerant curiosity . I think I both favored and feared it . What I knew of it in America was from reading about Oneida and Brook Farm , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good idea of what it would be like . But when the chance finally came to become a member of a collective in the mountains of North Carolina my wife and I both found , not only that our preconceived ideas were inaccurate but that we ourselves were pathetically unprepared for such a life . The initial shock of it was staggering . After some years of quiet householding in the Connecticut countryside we suddenly found ourselves forced to sit down to three meals a day with eighty-five to a hundred people , ranging in age from seven to seventy ; we had to live , eat , sleep , and work in the midst of all those people and we even had to be polite to them before breakfast . The result was that we lost our appetites , slept badly , and did no work at all . The baby caught our jitters like a disease and filled with her screams the only hours we had alone . By the end of the first week we had decided that the whole business was intolerable , We stayed only because we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the mountain ? the only escape from people who seemed to have no understanding of two unregenerate individualists ? and desperately discussed a way out of this mess . But there was no way out , so we stayed on in the mess . We stayed five months in all , and not only did we come to like it extremely but we also came to wonder if collective living is not the best and pleasantest possible solution to the problems of both housekeepers and providers . Yes , we even went so far as to wonder if it was not the only civilized way of living and if this business of individual house-holding was not the most wasteful and stubbornly foolish survival under the sun . We left the collective a year and a half ago , and we are still wondering . In fact , I should confess here that I wrote the first draft of this article shortly after our departure , and it then sounded so enthusiastic , so like a proclamation of conversion , that I put it aside until time could give me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in another that he will get plenty to eat , that he will be warmly and comfortably housed , that an illness in the family will cost him nothing , that the expenses of his summer vacation and an occasional trip will be paid for him , money will become a very slight matter in his life and , freed from its tyranny , he will be able to develop as a human being . Here I am going to try to present the case for collective living chiefly as an experiment to be tried , not by small colleges , but by people who have jobs of every sort , who maintain individual households , who have moderate incomes , who jitter when the dreaded first of the month rolls round , and who may be sufficiently fed up on the thankless struggle for existence to be ready for something new . Before I go on let me make one thing clear . Although I believe that collective living will be more widespread in a future society in America , I do not for a moment entertain the illusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ills or that its universal adaptation would lengthen by more than twenty minutes the life span of the painfully expiring capitalist system . It can promise no more than a means of relieving excessive strain in a time of social change . II In Connecticut at the present time we live an extremely simple life ; we have a small house far out in the country , drive a cheap car , entertain seldom and modestly . Yet our annual expenses for food , rent , light , gas , fuel , and other household incidentals are between $2500 and $3000 . At Collectiva the annual expense of maintaining three persons for an entire year would he under $1200 at a generous estimate ? a saving of more than fifty per cent . It is staggering to consider what it would mean , in terms of human happiness and relief from nervous tension , if every family of small income in the United States could find a way to cut the budget for necessities by fifty per cent ? or even twenty-five per cent ! For the aver-age American family living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace of mind and constant anxiety is not tremendously wide ; many could bridge it with an extra two or three hundred dollars a year . But that extra two or three hundred are never forthcoming somehow in spite of the most careful planning ; a baby , an illness , the need of a new roof on the house will dash the best plans in the world ; and then by the end of ten years it is two or three thousand of debt ? and those haggard , frustrated , bewildered men and women of forty who ride back and forth to work in subways and buses and trains are the very ones who started out not long ago with budgets , confidence , and a feeling that the world wanted them ! What does the future hold for them now ? Already they know the answer . They are worn out , physically and mentally stagnant ; year by year their usefulness decreases , and by the time they are fifty a world brutalized by profits will drop many of them very casually into the industrial ash-can. 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the futility of human living than to drive through the streets of any town or city in America and look upon the rows of houses with their little gardens and well-kept lawns and a tree or two for shade on Sunday . For every little house a man labors somewhere at a job he may not keep for long and a woman scrubs and washes dishes and hopes for an hour of peace before the baby wakens from its afternoon nap and the older children come home from school , and then in the evening this man and this woman whom God bath joined together sit tired and worried and debate whether they can squeeze a drink or a movie from the budget . It is a barbarous life , in which women who were once young and gay , men who were once courageous and laughing , wear themselves out in a senseless and unending slavery , cooped up in their little " strongholds of American democracy , " counting nickels , growing dull , growing irritable , growing old . cooking and housekeeping there for an average of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereby every member of the collective did his or her share of such work , the staff could be considerably reduced . But I am not sure it would be worth it . For the total cost of service per person came to about fifty cents a week . III After five months of living collectively you are inclined to the belief that the average human being , with all his faults , is a pretty decent , tolerant , good-natured , kind , often amusing and stimulating , person , fit to live with honor in any society under the sun . When you leave the collective and go out into the busy world again a strange and terrible sense of oppression begins to weigh on you . At first you do not know what is happening . People seem different , not quite as you remembered they were . You reflect that perhaps you have been living a very unreal life in the high mountains , that you have become accustomed to an unworldly and artificial island , that you have become afraid of reality . You look round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what you see is certainly no more " real " than what you have left . In fact , it seems considerably less real . The people you see about you are leading strained and twisted and agonized lives , chaotic and disorderly lives , lives that know nothing , that remain willfully ignorant , of their own form and motivation . Only now and again do you meet an individual ? a lonely farmer , a lonely scientist or artist ? who is a real person , devoid of sham , without a mask , living with a sense of order and peace . You look back unbelievingly upon the collective where you knew a hundred or so fairly ordinary people who , by some miracle , seemed to live pretty full lives , who were simple and intelligent , who were orderly and peaceful and unaggressive and whole . Wondering if it was all a dream , you seek out the very people who made the collective such an exciting and satisfying place to live in . They have left the collective only for the summer ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defensive , like the other people in the world . They even show off a little . Perhaps the trouble is that there are other people in the room whom they do n't know , whom they unconsciously need to impress . Then you get them alone and still the former real person refuses to materialize . Finally you become annoyed and , with effort , you break down and ask : " What 's the matter ? Are you depressed about something ? Is something going wrong ? " They look momentarily startled and then reply : " I was just going to ask the same thing about youl You seem so tense and guarded . " And it is the truth . With a sudden bitterness you feel how true it is . You have put on your armor against the world ; you have fenced yourself in with comfortable lies and deceptions ; you have used prejudices to bridge the abysses you ca n't think across ; you are doing sentry-duty on yourself , protecting your ego from unseen attack . All our human relation . ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are , how perplexed and lonely and strayed from the center . We expend half our strength to maintain this silence , this dumb mask of seeming ? and then one day , perhaps , it becomes too much for us and we run to a psychiatrist and let it come pouring out in order to save our lives . We live in daily fear of exposure , when exposure is what we most need . If we were exposed every morning we should be measured against the wall , and then at last we could begin to grow . At the bottom of every man 's heart is the secret longing for an enemy who will come and challenge him in the open , tell him all that there is to be told about him , lay bare his dread and fraudulence and blind aimlessness , and let him start over again , naked as the newborn . But we never feel quite strong enough to face that enemy and let him speak , and so we spend our lives amid the lage where I had lived for five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew myself better than I had ever dreamed would be possible and I learned how to think impersonally about my own problems for the first time in my life . For where the individual is relegated to the whole the individual comes into full flower . Most people who say they want to be " individuals " mean that they want to excel somebody else or that they want to be protected from life . They set up a fiction which is an idealized portrait of themselves ; then their business is to shield the fiction from attack ; they must keep it static in order to keep it intact , and they spend their lives laboring to make the fiction come true in terms of " success . " The more successful they are ? as business men , artists , housekeepers ? the less likely the fiction is to go to pieces under strain . The popularity of a writer like Dale Carnegie attests to the pathetic need of Americans to bolster up the fiction of an unreal , mechanized self . To Mr. Carnegie friendship does not mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means a commercial transaction , a way of making " contacts , " a means to money and influence ? an insincere artifice that has nothing to do with real human relations . Many of the men who killed themselves in the beginning of the last depression did so , not just because they had lost their money , but because the fiction of personal wealth as personal power and right to a special consideration had broken down beyond repair . They had led unexposed lives . The real man was flanked and hidden on all sides by his position , his bank account , the envy of his poorer friends , and the admiration of his associates who saw him as a " success " and never as a man . If the fiction had been blown to hell the real man might have walked out of the debris . As it was , the real man had to kill himself when the fiction man could no longer command respect . The tragic thing is that these poor mummers of men really do struggleagainst the chaos which weighs down their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , a loving wife , or a flattering friend will pull them back out of the range of their own artillery . I spent a horrible hour once seeing just such a loving wife rescue her husband who had decided , in a moment of personal crisis , that he was a hypocrite , a liar , a self-deluded and self-centered imitation of a man . It was the crisis of his life ; everything he had said about himself was true and he was ready to face the consequences of what had been and start over again , a purged person . But his wife subtly and enthusiastically rebuilt for him the fiction he had lived by for thirty-five years , convinced him finally that it was the truth and he was merely depressed ; and within an hour the man who had been on the verge of becoming a person stepped back again into the less exacting role of a shadow . Most of us never really see one another . How can we , meeting for a talk in the evening , meeting at parties , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to see people every day for many months , eat three meals daily with them , work with them , play with them , see them irritable before breakfast , exhausted at midnight , fighting with their wives , going through infatuations , exchanging ideas , losing arguments , winning victories , hating the world , depressed and bitter , triumphant and happy ? and then , if you are very receptive , you may achieve some dim and half-formulated conception of the real persons who live and suffer behind the faces you have known . Then , perhaps for the first time in your life , it slowly creeps into your mind that there is nothing more important than knowing about human beings , that until you do know about them you will have no idea of their true needs , no idea of what kind of government they need , what manner of social change promises most for humanity , what culture itself is . It occurs to you that probably you have never known anybody ; you have known only their shells , their pretenses. done and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . IV After you have lived in the collective for a while and then come out into the world , one of the things that strikes you most depressingly is the cockeyed state of so-called Christian marriage . It is suffocated by conventions , and even intelligent people do not escape them . The America of 1938 is supposedly a pretty free place as far as sex is concerned , and yet embarking on a marriage which you wish to have turn out happily is much like going to a desert island . You automatically cut yourself off from any real human relationship with the other sex save for the one representative of it who happens to be your choice . How many American husbands can go out fairly regularly with another woman without causing self-conscious snickers and , usually , a rather desperate and spurious need of flirtation ? People are so unnatural that they have to try to be funny about something they enjoy . What a pitiful sight is an average American party where repressed men and women , aided by a little alcohol , sheepishly cut loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the current code in this country , you must belong to one of two groups : either to that small and sophisticated group to whom extra-marital affairs are natural and accepted or to that very much larger group , making up the bulk of the population , to whom even the suggestion of an extra-marital affair is taboo . Both extremes are based on a preoccupation with sex ? extreme sexual freedom and extreme sexual prudishness ? and between them there seems to be very little room for what might be called extra-marital companion . ship . There seems to be an unwritten law that once you are married you must forego all those pleasant friendships with members of the opposite sex which you were free to enjoy before . To be thus cut off from free and intimate relationships with the other sex is to miss a quality of living ; and persons socut off either dry up and grow fidgety or else they finally explode and run off with someone whom they would never have thought seriously about if their being together had not been under such suspicion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it holds together , seems to be partly fostered by the way we Iive ? closed up in a house or an apartment together , never quite free to come and go as we please , each partner cautiously watching the other 's every movement as if from fear of having this unnatural mode of life exposed as the lonely sterile thing it is . In Collectiva something very subtle happens to the average marriage . Perhaps the first thing that happens is that it is gravely endangered , because the base of conventions upon which it rests is exposed as unnatural ? and marriages which have become nothing more than fearful mutual acceptance can not survive such exposure . But a good marriage grows stronger . It grows stronger partly because its partners are released from the necessity of conducting themselves according to a senseless code of mores , but it grows stronger mainly because a fructifying ease of relationships is inevitable in such a life . You can at last meet people without caution . Only those who have taken a world cruise on shipboard will have any inkling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease of companionship by ten , and subtract the alcoholic stimulation , the resulting picture will not be unlike collective living . All of the married couples in Collectiva had been married for some years before they came there , and were used to the kind of life in which they saw members of the opposite sex only in business , at dinner parties , or at dances ? occasions where true intimacy , true knowledge of one another , can never come into being . ( Parties in Collectiva were infrequent and , whenever given , impressed one as an absurd survival of a civilization wherein men and women force such artificial meetings in an effort to satisfy a hunger for the kind of intimacy which their conbe started in every city , town , and village in America . We have the facilities ; we have the economic need ; we have everything but the courage to surmount a prejudice and take a flier in the dark . It would certainly be well if it could be tried out now in a few communities , before there comes another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some such measure of protection . Big cities provide at present better equipment for collective living than small towns . Those who live in large apartment houses know all the annoyances of Collectiva and none of the advantages ; such apartment houses could be turned into collectives , at least physically , by merely making provision for a common dining room , library , and meeting-hall . That you can not impose collective living on people who have no interests or tastes in common goes without saying ; therefore , the group to occupy the apartment house has got to be carefully selected , and any hope of taking over a house with all its present tenants and creating a community out of unsympathetic material is sheer moonshine . In a small town it is easier to find a group of people with a common interest ? particularly if the town is centered round one industry ? but it is much harder to find the physical building or community of buildings ; in most cases they would have to be built . In a town near where I lived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers ' apartments without a single tenant , owing to the failure of a large factory ; this was an ideal situation , but it might not be duplicated in the whole State . New towns like Norris , Tennessee ? born of the TVA and very carefully planned ? offer perfect opportunities for collective living ; but the average small American town , with its blocks of houses filled with people who have widely disparate interests , offers nothing but a headache . Yet there are in America many abandoned country hotels ? particularly in the South ? and also any number of unoccupied private estates which could be rented quite cheaply , usuallyfor the annual taxes . If collective living becomes widespread in America there will be any number of enterprisers who will build communities to lease ; it is not even impossible that the Government relief projects might eventually include such plans ; but the day for either is not yet . For the time being , the pioneers of collective living will have to make shift of whatever facilities they arc lucky enough to find . Unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of common aim , the group is apt to go to pieces . It is for this reason that a small college or a farming collective is ideal . So ? if it were n't for the owners ? would be a mining collective . Or a big co-operative dairy , or a big cooperative ranch . In a future society , when industry is freed from profit domination and controlled co-operatively by the workers , a modern factory will be a splendid nucleus for a collective . For very important among the spiritual values of collective living is the almost mystical sense of " community " which it engenders . For such living is spiritual . People may embark on it from entirely practical motives ? to save money , to escape the drudgery of housework and the dulling exhaustion of bringing up children unaided ? but they can not live such a life very Iong without finding that the human community , once the destructive exterior competition between individuals has been replaced by the constructive interior kind , seems to them sacred and noble rather than jealous and unfriendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all classes of men and women ? for the well-to-do as well as for the proletariat ? seems to me beyond doubt . The biggest obstacle it has to face is what golfers call " a mental hazard " ? in this case the belief that we are a highly individualistic people to whom the thought of doing anything collectively is almost immoral . it is a strange paradox that the most standardized people on earth ? a people whose houses , clothes , speech , manners , thinking , and morality are as alike as
