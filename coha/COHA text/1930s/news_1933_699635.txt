txt The Reforestation Bill . Social workers do not regard the enactment of the reforestation bill as an unmixed blessing . Aside from its limited effect  --  upon the unemployment situation , the standard rate of $1 a day which it is reported the President will fix can only depress further a falling wage-level , and will certainly reduce the country 's consumptive power . The framers of the bill seem to have made no provision for the families of the men to be recruited . Presumably they are to be maintained out of the $30 monthly , assuming the entire wage goes to the dependents of the men in the camps , which will force these families down to a standard of living even lower than that enjoyed by families under the care of the City Emergency Home Relief Bureau . Through the operations of this act the government is actively participating in the destruction of the American standard of living to nineteenth-century levels , and is encouraging the break-up of homes with all this implies for the morale of the generation now in childhood .
