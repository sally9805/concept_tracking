As the noon recess bell rang through the halls of Tacoma 's Lowell School one day last week , books slapped shut , doors banged open and the boys tramped out toward home and lunch . A slim nine-year-old named George Weyerhaeuser loafed along in a sweatshirt and tennis shoes discussing with a friend the form and technique of competitive jumping . The friends parted and George proceeded to nearby Annie Wright Seminary , there to wait for his 13-year-old Sister Anne to come out and be driven home by the Weyerhaeuser chauffeur . A mother of one of the Wright girls spoke to George as he dawdled in front of the school . " He just wandered away , " she later recalled , " and I did not notice which way he went . " <P> The Weyerhaeuser chauffeur drove up . Anne came out . Together they waited minute after minute for little George . When he failed to appear , they hurried home to tell his parents who started a search of the neighborhood . At 2 p.m. the Weyerhaeusers notified the Tacoma police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispatched a special detachment of the state patrol to join the hunt . Within 24 hours 15 Department of Justice operatives from Portland , Seattle , San Francisco had converged by plane , train and car on Tacoma . The fearfully expected ransom note , posted at 6 p.m. , signed " The Egoist " and demanding $200,000 for George 's safe return , arrived special delivery at the Weyerhaeuser home at 6:25 . It directed that communication with " The Egoist " be inserted in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer over the name of " Percy Minnie . " Next day secrecy could be preserved no longer . The second morning the nation 's Press shrieked that one of the richest children in the U. S. had been KIDNAPPED . <P> In the East , editors scrabbled desperately through lean morgue folders for facts to show their readers just what calibre folk the Weyerhaeusers are . But in that vast quarter of the Union from St. Paul to Seattle the name needed no exposition . There the abduction of George , great-grandson of Frederick Weyerhaeuser , caused the same kind of sensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pierpont Morgan , were snatched . For the Weyerhaeusers are the royal family of the U.S. lumber business . Their kingdom , sprawled from Wisconsin to Washington , is a broad 3,000 square miles of the country 's best timberland supporting 94 Weyerhaeuser-operated or affiliated corporations which gross $20,000,000 a year . The fact that the Weyerhaeusers and associates have lost up to five million dollars a year for the past decade has not worried them overmuch .
