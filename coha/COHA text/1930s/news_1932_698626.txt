txt Depositors in the Unity Trust &; Savings Bank of Chicago have been asked to withdraw all their money immediately . In a letter to 2200 depositors , the board of directors point out that a steady seepage of deposits has necessitated the sacrificing of sound securities in order to provide the cash to meet withdrawal demands . The directors , while voicing an appeal for confidence in banks , feel that it is not fair to depositors to allow them to keep money invested when there is no chance to provide a fair return and where it is impossible for the bank to make expenses . Liquidation of the bank deposits without loss to depositors was made possible through a loan of $200,000 from the Federal Reconstruction Corporation , Mitch the directors of the bank personally guaranteed . Mr. John Henry , vice-president and cashier of the bank , declared that the help given this bank was an outstanding example of the effectiveness of the Federal Reconstruction efforts . One of Few Cases Chicago 's bank failures have been numerous in the past few years , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , but this is said to be at least the fourth case here where a bank has closed voluntarily and paid off in full . The letter to the depositors follows : A bank can not be run without depositors and deposits . It is not fair to stockholders to allow them to keep their money invested when there is no possible chance to provide a fair return for their investment . A short time ago Unity Trust &; Savings Bank had deposits of nearly $1,000,000 . On that basis the bank was operated profitably . Today , deposits have shrunk to less than $250,000 . A sum greater than this is represented by the capital structure of the bank . It is a physical impossibility to even make expenses on this basis . Bank Takes Initiative The bank 's board of directors has therefore decided to bring an end to this steady seepage of deposits . Instead of allowing depositors to come in a few at a time and withdraw portions of their balanbes , thereby necessitating the sacrificing of sound securities in order to provide the cash to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to liquidate deposits in their entirety . Unity Trust &; Savings Bank will therefore pay all of its depositors the full amount of their balance now in cash . To those depositors who have remained with us ? you and 2200 others ? we voice our sincere appreciation for the loyalty , confidence and patronage shown to us through the years that have followed the founding of this bank . Were all our depositors as loyal as you have been , this community could continue to have the full financial facilities it has need for . In deciding on this unusual means of meeting a frenzied public 's demand , officers and directors of Unity Trust &; Savings Bank are showing the same loyalty to you that you and other remaining depositors have shown in us . Sound Chicago banks are worthy of the same faith you have shown in this bank .
