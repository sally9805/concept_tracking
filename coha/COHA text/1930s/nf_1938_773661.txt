txt // ate and bicarbonate . Its principal ferments are trypsin ( pancreatic protease ) , amylopsin ( pancreatic amylase ) , steapsin ( pancreatic lipase ) and rennin . Trypsin acts upon the proteoses and peptones formed in the peptic digestion of protein . This ferment is also capable of attacking any protein which has escaped gastric digestion , and converting it to proteoses and peptones . Trypsin breaks the peptone molecule into smaller groups of amino-acids , named peptids . When the amino-acid groups are relatively large they are called polypeptids . The final stage in the digestion of protein , that is , the complete disruption of the molecule into its individual amino-acids , is brought about by the erepsin of four amino-acids ( tetrapeptids ) and three ( tripeptids ) or even two ( dipeptids ) are formed during Cryptic digestion . Juice collected directly from the pancreatic duct has very little power to digest protein ; but , if allowed to come into contact with the intestinal mucosa , it at once becomes active . The inactive material in the juice is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituent of the intestinal juice , named enterokinase ( p. 253 ) . Trypsinogen is also activated by calcium . Trypsin can act only in an alkaline medium , the optimum pH being around 8.5 . Amylopsin or pancreatic amylase ( also called pancreatic A // diastase ) has an action similar to that of the ptyalin in saliva ( p. 227 ) , converting starch into maltose . But pancreatic juice has a more powerful starch-splitting action than has saliva ; it is also afforded a longer time in which to act . As compared with saliva , pancreatic juice is , therefore , of much greater importance in the digestion of starch . The pancreatic juice contains also some maltase which converts a part of the maltose to glucose . Steapsin , or pancreatic lipase , splits fats into their constituents ? fatty acids and glycerine ( glycerol ) . If the intestinal contents are alkaline in reaction , the liberated fatty acids combine with alkali to form soaps . The action of the steapsin upon the fat , tristearin , is shown in the following equation : Soap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent , for soaps can form only in an alkaline medium ; any which may have formed become precipitated again when the medium is acidified . The intestinal contents are slightly acid in reaction except when the pancreatic secretion is at its height . Even then , it is only the duodenal contents which are rendered slightly alkaline , the contents of the rest of the intestinal tract remaining acid . The optimum pH for the action of pancreatic lipase is from 6.7 to 7.0 . The secretion of pancreatic juice . The secretion of pancreatic juice is brought about by a hormone formed in the mucosa of the small intestine . The existence of this hormone was demonstrated in 1902 by Bayliss and Starling . They found that a hydrochloric acid extract of the duodenal // mucosa , when injected intravenously , caused the secretion of pancreatic juice . The intravenous injection of the acid alone was ineffective . On the other hand , the introduction of hydrochloric acid into a loop of bowel whose nerves had been sectioned , and which was , therefore , isolated from all connections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was followed by a secretion of pancreatic juice . It was therefore concluded that in the normal course of digestion the acid chyme , after reaching the duodenum , acted upon the duodenal mucosa to cause the formation and absorption into the blood stream of a hormone which excited the pancreatic cells . The hormone was named secretin . Later work has shown that extracts of the intestinal mucosa made with solvents other than acid , namely , water or alcohol ; are active . It has also been demonstrated that bile introduced into the duodenum causes secretin to be absorbed into the blood stream and induces , in consequence , a secretion of pancreatic juice . // The secretion of pancreatic juice is also brought about through nerve impulses . Stimulation of the vagus nerve causes the secretion of a juice very rich in digestive ferments ; rapid exhaustion of the zymogen granules results . Secretin , on the other hand , appears to be responsible mainly for the secretion of the inorganic constituents and water of the juice . It was shown several years ago by Pavlov that psychic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of evoking a secretion of pancreatic juice . These reflex secretory effects were particularly well shown by feeding experiments in dogs . However , the psychic or cephalic element plays a much less prominent role in pancreatic than in gastric secretion . The intestinal juice . The mucosa of the small intestine contains great numbers of fine , finger-like processes the intestinal villi ( Fig. 126 ) . These are responsible for the velvety appearance of the intestinal mucosa . The intestinal juice or succus entericus is secreted by glands ? the crypts of Lieberkuhn ? whose mouths open into the intestinal lumen at the bases of the villi ( Fig. 127 ) . The epithelial cells covering the villi are continued into the crypts of Lieberkuhn . Many of these cells become converted to goblet cells ( p. 9 ) which discharge mucus . The cells which secrete the enzymes of the juice are situated toward the bottom of the crypts . Composition . The intestinal juice is alkaline in reaction , due to its content of sodium carbonate and bicarbonate . It contains enterokinase , the activator of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // 1 . Erepsin , a proteolytic ferment . 2 . Sucrase , maltase and lactase , ferments which act upon the disaccharides , sucrose ( cane sugar ) , maltose ( sugar of malt ) , lactose ( milk sugar ) , respectively . 3 . Lipase . Erepsin completes the digestion of protein , splitting the peptids which have resisted Cryptic digestion into their component amino-acids . It does not act upon unchanged protein , and is therefore a peptidase rather than a proteinase . It acts best at a pH around 8 . The intestinal wall itself contains erepsin , and small amounts are present in other tissues of the body , including the blood . The intestinal wall also contains enzymes nuclease , nucleotidase and nucleosidase ? capable of digesting nucleic acid and its derivatives ( p. 289 ) . Sucrase , maltase and lactase . Sucrose is split by sucrase into a molecule each of glucose and fructose ; maltose when acted upon by maltase yields two molecules of glucose ; and lactose is converted into a molecule each of glucose and galactose , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following equation . Lipase , though in lower concentration in the succus entericus than in pancreatic juice , plays an important role , nevertheless , in the digestion of fat . The importance of its action is shown after abolishing the effect of the pancreatic lipase , as by tying the pancreatic duct . Following this procedure at least 70% of the fat in the food undergoes digestion . The secretion of intestinal juice . Mechanical types of stimulation are particularly effective in causing a secretion of intestinal juice . The contact with the intestinal mucosa of rough indigestible constituents of the food , and especially distension of the intestinal wall itself by food masses , exert a pronounced excitatory effect upon the intestinal glands . // The secretion is brought about reflexly through the nerve plexuses of the intestinal wall . The extrinsic nerves ( vagus or sympathetic ) do not appear to have any excitatory effect . If either of these nerves exert any effect at all upon secretion , it is of an inhibitory nature . The question whether or not a hormone plays a role in controlling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some evidence that secretin stimulates the intestinal glands as well as the pancreas . THE BILE Composition . Human bile is a clear yellow or orangecolored fluid secreted by the liver cells . Its chief constituents are the bile pigments , the bile salts , lecithin , cholesterol , inorganic salts and mucin . The following table gives the average composition of human bile as it is secreted by the liver . Bile collected from the gall-bladder is much more concentrated than liver bile ( see p. 258 ) . The bile pigments are called bilirubin and biliverdin . They are derived from the hemoglobin liberated from red blood corpuscles , which at all times are undergoing disintegration in the blood stream ( p. 32 ) . The conversion of the hemoglobin to bilirubin is effected by the reticulo-endothelial cells of the spleen , liver ( Kupffer cells ) , bone marrow and general connective tissues ( p. 48 ) . The pigments consist of the porphyrin part of the hemoglobin molecule ; that is , the remnant of the molecule after the globin and iron have been // removed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porphyrin in hemoglobin , for the chemical structure of the porphyrin group is also altered . The iron liberated in the conversion of hemoglobin to bile pigment is stored chiefly in the liver and spleen . Bilirubin ( C33H36N406 ) is an orange-red pigment ; it is the chief pigment in human bile and in the bile of dogs . Biliverdin ( C33H36N4O8 ) is green and constitutes the greater part of the pigment in the bile of birds and of herbivorous mammals . It is simply an oxidation product of bilirubin . Upon reaching the intestine , bilirubin undergoes reduction as a result of bacterial action . This reduction product , which gives the yellow-brown color to feces , is called stercobilinogen ( also called urobilinogen ) . Upon exposure to air a part of the stercobilinogen is oxidized , and is then called stercobilin ( or urobilin ) . Though the greater part of the stercobilinogen is passed with the feces , a part is absorbed // into the portal circulation and returned to the liver , whence it is discharged again in the bile ( see Fig. 128 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or none at all , find their way into the general circulation . Any which does escape from the liver into the systemic blood is excreted by the kidney , but the amount is so small that it does not stain the urine ; it can be detected only by delicate chemical tests . The yellow color of the healthy urine is not due , therefore , to this pigment ( see p. 204 ) . The bile salts are sodium glycocholate and sodium taurocholate . The bile acids glycocholic and taurocholic are pro-duced in the liver by the union of cholic acid ( C24H40O5 ) with the amino-acids glycine and taurine respectively . The cells of the liver are arranged in rows , the so-called liver cords , which radiate like the spokes of a wheel from the centers of the liver lobules ( see Fig. 129 ) . On one side of each liver cord is a blood channel ( sinusoid ) , on the other side , a fine vessel ( the bile capillary ) into which the bile , elaborated by the hepatic cells from the constituents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join to form larger bile channels which eventually lead into a single vessel ? the hepatic duct . The liver forms and secretes bile continuously , but , instead of passing directly into the intestine as it is formed , the bile passes into the gall-bladder from which it is discharged from time to time into the duodenum. // The storage of bile and its discharge into the intestine . The gall-bladder is a small pear-shaped sac which , in the human subject , has a capacity of about 50 cc . It is situated on the under surface of the liver ( Fig. 130 ) . Leading from its lower and smaller end is the cystic duct . The cystic duct joins the hepatic duct at an acute angle to form the common bile duct . The latter joins the pancreatic duct , the chamber formed by the fusion of the two ducts being known as the ampulla of Vater ( p. 249 ) . The opening of the ampulla of Vater is guarded by a ring of muscle called the sphincter of Oddi . The bile passes from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevented from entering the intestine by the tonic contraction of this sphincter . When the biliary pressure reaches a value of from 50 to 70 mm. of water , the bile forces its way along the cystic duct into the gallbladder where it is stored until required . Water and salts are absorbed from the bile during its stay in the gallbladder . The bile of the gall-bladder has , therefore , a much higher concentration of pigments , bile salts , cholesterol and lecithin than has bile collected from the hepatic duct . A ten-fold increase in bile concentration may result . // The wall of the gall-bladder is composed of a thin layer of smooth muscle lined by mucous membrane . During a meal the gall-bladder contracts , and discharges its contents down the cystic and common bile ducts . The sphincter of Oddi at the same time relaxes , thus permitting free passage of the bile into the duodenum . The gall-bladder is supplied with fibers from the vagus and sympathetic nerves , and , undoubtedly , nervous influences play a part in the mechanism of the expulsion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , following the sight , smell or taste of food . Nevertheless , evacuation of the gall-bladder follows the ingestion of food after all nervous connections of the organ have been severed . The contractions must , therefore , be caused by some material carried in the blood stream . Such a material has been extracted from the mucosa of the duodenum by Dr. A. C. Ivy and his colleagues in Chicago . The hormone , for it must be classed as such , has been named cholecystokinin . The injection of a very small amount of this material causes contractions of the gall-bladder in animals or in man . It is quite distinct from secretin , the hormone for pancreatic secretion . Not all types of food are equally effective in causing the production or liberation of the gall-bladder hormone , fatty foods , especially egg-yolk and cream , being by far the most effective . Shortly after a meal of fat the gall-bladder , which may have been quiescent for several hours previously , contracts forcibly and expels its contents into the duodenum . In order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have undergone digestion , apparently . That is to say , the products of fat digestion appear to be the essential materials which call the hormonal mechanism into play . Protein and carbohydrate foods are much less effective as stimulating agents than fat . The functions of the bile . The bile , besides serving as a vehicle for the elimination of pigments and certain other waste products , performs important functions in the intestine . Its main function is concerned with the digestion and // absorption of fat . Though the bile does not contain a fatsplitting enzyme , and , therefore , has no direct action upon the digestion of fat , the bile salts , through their power to lower surface tension , aid very greatly the emulsification of fatty materials in the intestinal contents . The digestion of fat is materially advanced thereby , for the division of the oily materials into small globules increases by several fold the surface exposed to the action of the pancreatic and intestinal lipases . The bile salts have also the property of rendering soluble , in the aqueous fluids of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is the socalled hydrotropic action of the bile salts . The dissolved fatty acids , in turn , have the property of lowering surface tension ; any soaps which may be formed during digestion , and the cholesterol of the bile , have a similar action . These several factors conspire to produce a fine emulsion of fatty material in the small intestine . The bile salts aid fat digestion in another way . They serve as specific activators of the pancreatic lipase . That is , quite apart from their emulsifying effect , they enhance very greatly the fat-splitting action of the pancreatic juice . The action of the intestinal lipase is not altered in this specific way by bile . Bile , important though it is for the efficient digestion of fat , is of still greater importance for fat absorption . When bile is excluded from the intestine over 80 per cent of the fat is digested , i.e. , split into fatty acids and glycerine . A large proportion of the fatty acids , however , is not absorbed , but appears in the feces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salts in the absorption of fat been elucidated . They unite in the intestine with the fatty acids to form complex compounds which pass readily into the epithelial cells covering the intestinal villi . Here the bile salts are freed again from the union , and are carried in the portal blood to the liver which excretes them again in the bile . This circulation of the bile salts has been known for a long time , though its significance was not apparent . The fatty // acids liberated from their combination with the bile salts now combine with glycerine which has penetrated into the epithelial cells from the intestinal lumen . The products of fat digestion ? fatty acids and glycerine are thus reunited within the epithelial cells to form neutral fat . The greater part ( about 60% ) of the synthesized fat passes into the small lymphatics ( lacteals ) running through the centers of the villi . The course taken by the remaining 40 per cent of the fat is uncertain . It is probably absorbed into the blood of the portal system . Jaundice ( Fr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human plasma contains a small quantity of bilirubin . The concentration ranges in different persons and ranges from 0.1 to 0.5 mgm. per 100 cc . The bilirubin of the plasma is that which , having been formed by the reticulo-endothelial cells from the hemoglobin , is on its way to the liver for excretion . When excessive amounts of bilirubin are present in the plasma , the skin , mucous membranes and whites of the eyes are stained yellow . The condition is called jaundice or icterus . Bilirubin appears also in the urine and sweat , but does not pass into the saliva . An abnormally high concentration of plasma bilirubin may be due to excessive amounts of the pigment being produced , the liver and excretory channels being normal . On the other hand , the quantity of pigment formed in the body may be within normal limits , but the function of the liver is impaired as a result of some toxic or infective process , and does not remove bilirubin readily from the plasma . Again , the bile passages may be obstructed ; the bile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore three types of jaundice , ( 1 ) hemolytic , ( 2 ) toxic or infective , and ( 3 ) obstructive . Hemolytic jaundice is seen in conditions which cause increased destruction of red cells , e.g. , pernicious anemia , hemolytic anemia and poisoning with certain hemolytic agents . This type of jaundice is not uncommon in the newborn infant ; it persists for four or five days after birth . The // baby comes into the world with an excess of red cells , which undergo destruction during the first few days , the concentration of bilirubin in the plasma being thus increased to the point at which jaundice appears . The condition is harmless , and indeed may be looked upon as a physiological phenomenon . In the hemolytic types of jaundice the stools are dark , due to the increased pigment excretion ; urobilin may appear in the urine . In the toxic and infective types of jaundice the liver cells are injured by some poison or infective process which interferes with their ability to eliminate bile pigment . Obstructive jaundice is most often the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallstone within its lumen , or by a tumor pressing upon it from without . In this type the discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes is usually intense . The feces are pale , being usually described as " clay colored , " because pigment is , of course , excluded from the intestinal tract . The urine is usually deeply colored with bilirubin . Movements of the small intestine . Three types of movement occur in the small intestine , ( a ) peristaltic , ( b ) segmenting and ( c ) pendular . Peristaltic movement ( peristalsis ) . This kind of movement is not restricted to the small intestine , but is characteristic of hollow muscular tubes in general . It has been mentioned as occurring in the esophagus during the third stage of swallowing , and in the pyloric part of the stomach . It is also seen in the large intestine , as well as in the ureter , Fallopian tube and common bile duct . The movement consists of a ring-like contraction of the muscular wall of the tube . The annular contraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of constriction of the bowel which sweeps before it any material within the lumen ( Fig. 131 ) . The movement is readily started by a mechanical , an electrical or a chemical stimulus . The most powerful stimulus is distension of the bowel , i.e. , stretching of the muscle fibers . // Filling of the bowel with food material provides just such a stimulus , the contraction occurring immediately behind the stimulated region . Peristaltic movements may follow one another at regular and fairly frequent inter-vals , the intestinal con-tents being moved steadily but gently along the canal . At other times a brisk peristaltic contraction appears which travels rapidly along the tube but , after moving the food a considerable distance , may not be repeated for some time . This is called the peristaltic rush . Especially strong stimulation , the action of a cathartic or an irritant poison , for example , may set up a peristaltic rush which travels throughout the length of the small bowel . Such a movement may also be initiated reflexly from the esophagus during swallowing , or from the stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intestine which serve to break up and knead the food , to mix it thoroughly with the intestinal juices , and to bring the intestinal contents in contact with fresh absorptive surfaces . These movements also increase the blood and lymph flow in the bowel wall but exert no propulsive action upon the food . They occur at the rate of from 20 to 30 per minute ( see Fig. 132 ) . // The pendular movements are simple constrictions of the intestinal wall . They move up and down the bowel for short distances , giving a to and fro movement to the semifluid material in the canal , and thus lending further aid to the processes of digestion and absorption . The innervation of the small intestine . The small intestine receives fibers from the vagus ( parasympathetic ) and the splanchnic ( sympathetic ) nerves . The vagus is excitatory , the sympathetic inhibitory ( see Pl. 7 A ) . It will be noted that the actions of these nerves upon the intestine , as compared with the actions upon the heart , are reversed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these lies between the two muscular coats ( circular and longitudinal ) of the intestine and is called Auerbach 's plexus ; ganglion cells are found among the network of nerve fibers . The other plexus , known as Meissner 's , lies in the submucosa ( Pl. 7 B ) . The vagal fibers connect with the ganglion cells of Auerbach 's plexus ; the impulses are thence conveyed by the axons of these cells ( postganglionic fibers ) to the muscle fibers . The sympathetic fibers , on the other hand , do not form junctions with ganglion cells in the intestinal wall but pass directly to the muscle cells . The postganglionic sympathetic fibers arise from cells in the celiac and superior mesenteric ganglia ( p. 456 ) . Though the bowel movements are influenced by impulses travelling over the vagus and splanchnic nerves , they are not dependent upon them , for the three types of intestinal movement continue after all nerves of extrinsic origin have been sectioned . The peristaltic movements are then carried out through the intrinsic nervous mechanism ( plexuses of Auerbach and Meissner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the property of rhythmical activity of the muscle fibers themselves , and not upon any nervous mechanism . They continue in a strip of intestinal muscle after its nerve plexuses have been removed or paralyzed by cocaine . // The ileocolic sphincter . The small intestine opens into the upper part of the cecum . The ring of muscle surrounding the opening is called the ileocolic sphincter . It controls the passage of the ileal contents into the cecum and prevents or hinders the reflux of material into the ileum , thus protecting the small bowel from contamination by the putrefactive bacteria which flourish in the large intestine . The sphincter opens and closes during digestion , permitting gushes of ileal contents to enter the cecum . During fasting it remains closed for long periods , but opens within a few minutes after a meal . This indicates a reflex action initiated by the entrance of food into the stomach . The ileocolic sphincter receives motor fibers through the sympathetic ; inhibitory fibers have not been demonstrated . The contents of the ileum are semifluid in consistency and acid in reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material becomes more plastic in character as a result of the absorption of water ; its acid reaction undergoes little change . The movements and innervation of the large intestine . Food material reaches the cecum about 4 hours after a meal . Rhythmical movements resembling the segmenting movements in the small intestine may be seen occasionally in this part of the large intestine , but peristaltic contractions are absent . Regular and frequently recurring peristaltic contractions are absent also from the rest of the large intestine . At certain long intervals , however , a strong peristaltic wave commencing in the upper end of the ascending colon moves swiftly over the transverse colon . This mass movement , as it is called , is analogous to the peristaltic rush in the small intestine ; it empties the transverse colon , sweeping the material into the descending and pelvic colons . The pelvic colon and lower part of the descending colon serve as a storehouse for the feces until the desire to defecate is aroused . The cecum , ascending colon and the first third or so of the transverse colon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The remainder of the large intestine , including the rectum and the anal canal , is supplied with motor fibers through the pelvic nerves ( parasympathetic from the 2nd , 3rd and 4th sacral segments of the spinal cord ) . The inhibitory fibers to the entire large intestine are derived from the sympathetic . These two sets of nerves act upon the internal anal sphincter in a reverse fashion ; the sympathetic is excitatory , the pelvic nerve inhibitory . As stated previously , the sympathetic is also the motor nerve to the ileocolic sphincter . The external anal sphincter is under voluntary control through the pudendal nerves . In health , the antagonistic effects of the parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves to the large bowel are nicely balanced . But the balance is sometimes upset . Relaxation and weakness of the walls of the descending and pelvic colons result from overactivity of the sympathetic innervation . The tone of the internal anal sphincter , on the other hand , is exaggerated . The colon is unable to empty itself effectually , and dilatation of its lumen , often to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( G. mega = large ) or Hirschsprung 's disease . When , on the other hand , the pelvic nerve ( parasympathetic ) is hyperactive the descending colon becomes firmly contracted ; its lumen is obliterated . This ? the so-called spastic colon ? is one cause of chronic constipation ( p. 268 ) . Defecation ( evacuation of the bowels ) is a reflex act initiated by the passage of feces into the rectum . Normally the rectum is empty , except just before defecation ; feces are forced into it from the pelvic colon by a mass movement . The latter movement is often started by the entrance of food into the stomach ? gastrocolic reflex . This reflex is responsible for the desire to defecate so often experienced a short time after a meal , especially breakfast . The distension of the rectum as it becomes filled with feces acts as a stimulus to afferent nerve endings in the rectal wall . The impulses set up are conveyed to a center in the sacral part // of the spinal cord . The efferent nerve fibers pass to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the internal anal sphincter , via the pelvic nerves , and to the external anal sphincter and the striated muscle lying in relation to the rectum , via the pudendal nerves . A higher center for defecation is situated in the medulla oblongata . This is connected to the lower center by tracts of fibers in the spinal cord . The intrarectal pressure necessary to start the defecation reflex is from 40 to 50 mm . Hg . The movement of defecation consists of a powerful peristaltic contraction of the descending and pelvic colons and rectum , assisted usually by a voluntary contraction of the abdominal muscles , and of the striated muscles lying in relation to the rectum ( levatores ani and rectococcygeus muscles ) . Relaxation of the anal sphincters occurs reciprocally with the contraction of the bowel wall . Constipation . Persons vary considerably in the frequency with which their bowels are evacuated . In some a bowel movement occurs two or even three times daily , while others may feel no discomfort if an interval of two days or more elapses between movements . The majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning after breakfast . Owing to this variability , it is difficult to give a precise definition of constipation . However , when the interval between bowel movements is greater than twentyfour hours and the subject , as a result , suffers distress or discomfort , e.g. , headaches , digestive disturbances , etc. , or if the feces are abnormally dry and hard , and the evacuation of the bowels difficult , constipation certainly exists . Constipation is caused most commonly by bad habits . As mentioned on p. 266 , the desire to empty the bowel is aroused by the passage of feces into the rectum ; and the stimulation of afferent nerve endings in the bowel wall . The act can , however , be voluntarily restrained and , when this is practiced , the rectal wall accommodates its capacity to the bulk of the feces ( postural tone , p. 221 ) ; the afferent nerve // endings are no longer adequately stimulated , and the desire to defecate passes . The retained feces become dry and hard , as a result of the absorption of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way is persisted in , the rectum , which normally , except just before evacuation , is empty , contains feces most of the time ; it becomes less sensitive to distension , and its muscle , as well as that of the pelvic colon , loses its tone . It is well known that the reflex mechanisms governing the emptying of the bowel are amenable to " training . " When the habit of emptying the bowels at a certain hour each day is practised for a while , the desire to do so tends to recur regularly at this time . Other causes of constipation are ( a ) a diet which leaves too little unabsorbed residue ( and so fails to stimulate intestinal activity ) or one which contains too little fluid . ( b ) A colon which absorbs too readily and thus causes undue drying of the feces. ( c ) Hypertonic state of the muscle of the colon ? spastic constipation ; the transverse and descending colons are the seat of a strong tonic contraction which impedes the passage of feces . The general effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to require description . But their cause is a subject upon which there is much misunderstanding . We hear a great deal of poisons formed in the intestinal tract , and the dire effects which they are supposed to have upon the body . Intestinal intoxication is glibly spoken of , and advertisements in the daily press exhort one to irrigate the colon , in order to remove the noxious materials . There is no doubt whatever that small amounts of powerful poisons are formed in the large intestine as a result of the action of bacteria upon amino-acids which have escaped absorption in the small intestine . Some of these substances ? known generally as amines are formed by the removal of a molecule of carbon dioxide from such amino-acids as alanine , tyrosine , histidine , etc . Among the more potent of such amines are ethylamine ( from alanine ) , histamine ( from // histidine ) and tyramine ( from tyrosine ) . However , the production of such poisons is a perfectly normal process , and there is nothing more certain than that they can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furred tongue or any of the other effects of constipation . The body is provided with mechanisms for rendering innocuous the poisons formed in the colon . The first line of defense raised against such substances is in the wall of the bowel itself ; here some are destroyed or changed into harmless compounds . The second and most important detoxicating mechanism is in the liver , where the toxic bodies are combined with sulphuric acid or with glycuronic acid . The resulting compounds ( indoxyl sulphuric acid and glycuronates ) pass from the liver to the kidney for excretion . To what then are the symptoms of constipation due ? It is now generally conceded that they are of reflex origin . Afferent impulses set up in the distended colon or rectum , though ineffectual in precipitating the defecation reflex , produce reflex effects in other parts of the body , particularly the stomach and blood vessels . The headache is probably due to the effect upon the intracranial blood vessels . The rapid relief from the ill effects of constipation which follows evacuation of the bowels is a common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such effects being of toxic origin , for it is inconceivable that poisons could be freed so swiftly from the blood stream . To quote the pertinent comment of Dr. Alvarez , who has devoted much time to a study of the question , " A drunken man does not at once become sober when the whisky bottle is taken from him . " ABSORPTION FROM THE INTESTINAL TRACT The absorption of food materials is practically confined to the small intestine . Alcohol is absorbed from the stomach , but water , glucose and other substances are absorbed to a negligible extent through the gastric mucosa . Water and , to a certain extent , mineral salts are absorbed from the large // intestine ; as a result , the intestinal contents undergo a considerable reduction in bulk in their passage through this part of the intestinal tract . The alimentary tract from a physiological point of view must be considered as lying outside of the body proper . Food material captured from the environment and held within the digestive tube can not be said truly to have entered the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the skin covers the outer surface of the body , so the mucosa of the gastro-intestinal tract constitutes its inner surface . An examination of the interior of the small intestine shows how well this part of the lining of the body has been fashioned for increasing the area exposed for the absorption of food materials . The mucosa is raised into circular folds ( plicae circulares ) which in the upper part of the intestine may be nearly a third of an inch in depth . These and the intestinal villi ( p. 253 ) , especially the latter , increase enormously the total absorbing surface ( see Fig. 135 ) . It has been estimated that the number of villi in the human small intestine is around 5,000,000 and the absorbing surface not far short of 10 square meters ? more than five times the skin surface . The center of each villus is occupied by an arteriole and venule , and a lymph vessel or lacteal . The arteriole leads into a network of capillaries lying just beneath the epithelial covering of the villus . The central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth muscle fibers . If the intestinal mucosa of a living animal is examined with the low power of the microscope , the villi will be found to be in ceaseless motion , swaying or lashing from side to side , and lengthening and shortening alternately . These movements , by their constant agitation of the intestinal fluids in the immediate neighborhood of the villi , aid very materially the digestive and absorptive processes . It will be recalled that the intestinal mucosa is impermeable to the large molecules of the three foodstuffs , carbohyABSORPTION // drates ( starch and the disaccharides cane sugar , maltose and lactose ) , proteins and fats , but permits the free passage of the smaller molecules , glucose , amino-acids , fatty acids and glycerine liberated by enzyme action . The absorption of these materials is not , however , a simple process of diffusion , in which the intestinal mucosa acts merely as a passive membrane . On the contrary , the epithelial cells covering the villi take an active part in the absorption , as is evidenced by the observation that an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process . Furthermore , the absorption , as shown by the following experiment , is selective . When the three sugars glucose , galactose and fructose , in equal concentrations , are placed in a loop of bowel immersed in saline , glucose passes through the intestinal wall more rapidly than does galactose , and galactose more rapidly than fructose , provided that the intestinal mucosa remains viable and uninjured . After injury or death of the mucosa the three sugars pass through it at equal rates , i.e. , simply by diffusion . After passing through the epithelium of the villi , the glucose and amino-acids are absorbed into the network of blood vessels mentioned above ; fat , synthesized in the epithelial cells from fatty acids and glycerine , passes , for the most part , into the lymph channels . The formation of the feces . The feces are not , simply and solely , unabsorbed residues of the food , but are made up largely of materials excreted from the blood . During starvation , for example , the bulk of the feces may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bowel isolated from the rest of the intestine becomes filled after a few days with a pasty mass indistinguishable from ordinary feces . Bacteria make up about 9 per cent of the feces ; the other main solid constituents are food residues , which vary considerably in amount with the proportion of indigestible material ( chiefly cellulose ) in the diet , fats , nitrogenous substances and minerals eliminated from the blood , together // with epithelial cells and leucocytes , shed from the intestinal mucosa . A very small proportion of digestible food appears in the feces . In other words , practically all the protein , fat and carbohydrate which is eaten is absorbed , the food residues of the feces consisting almost entirely of indigestible substances . Vegetable material , since its framework is composed of cellulose , contributes more to the feces than do other foods . This indigestible material or " roughage , " as it is commonly termed , serves a useful purpose in that it acts as a mechanical stimulus , increasing the motility as well as the secretions of the bowel wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general term applied to the various chemical processes , whatever their nature , taking place in living tissues , e.g. , the oxidation of food materials with the liberation of energy , the decomposition of compounds into more elementary principles , the chemical transformation of one material into another , and the synthesis of complex compounds from others of simpler constitution , as in the processes of tissue repair and growth , or in the manufacture of internal secretions and enzymes . Reactions involving decompositions are embraced by the term catabolism ; those of a synthetic nature are referred to as anabolism . Though some of the reactions taking place in the body are accompanied by the absorption of heat ( endothermic reactions ) , in the great majority , e.g. , oxidations , heat is evolved ( exothermic reactions ) . The sum total of all the chemical reactions occurring in the body is referred to as general metabolism , and is expressed in terms of heat given out by the body in a given time . Those chemical changes , whether of a catabolic or an anabolic nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat , protein , purine , calcium , etc. , undergoes in the body is referred to as special metabolism . GENERAL METABOLISM The sun is the source of all energy on the earth . Plant life through its possession of the green coloring matter , chlorophyl , is capable of utilizing the energy of sunlight to form carbohydrate material from the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere and water drawn from the soil . The animal body , of course , can not make direct use of solar energy ; it 273 // must depend upon the energy stored by the plant or upon that provided by the tissues of other animals . The food ? fat , carbohydrate and protein ? derived from either of these sources therefore represents stored or potential energy . The carbon of the food , after absorption from the intestinal tract , is oxidized in the tissues . Energy is liberated thereby for muscular activity and for maintaining the vital functions , e.g. , the action of the heart , the movements of the gastrointestinal tract , the excitability of nervous tissues , etc . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel is to an engine ; they represent a certain amount of potential energy which the body can convert to other forms of energy ? mechanical , electrical , chemical and thermal . When the body is at rest , that is , when no external work is being performed , the energy liberated from food materials appears ultimately as heat . A heat unit , the large Calorie , ' is therefore employed as a measure of the energy liberated in the animal body . A Calorie is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise a kilogram of water from 15 ? to 16 ? C. Of the energy expended during muscular exercise , as in lifting a weight , walking , etc. , about 25 per cent appears as work , the remaining 75 per cent is converted to heat . The law of the conservation of energy states that , though one form of energy is convertible into any other form , the sum total of the energy in the universe is constant energy can not be created or destroyed . This law holds true for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given quantity of food when completely oxidized in the tissues yields its entire store of potential energy to the body ? the energy intake balances the energy output , as measured by the heat produced and the work performed . The food may not be completely oxidized in the body ; a part may be stored , or , as with protein ( see p. 276 ) , a part resists oxidation and is excreted . Nevertheless , an energy The large Calorie used in physiology is written with a capital C to distinguish it from the small calorie used in the physical laboratory . // balance can be struck , if any gain in weight is noted ( stored energy ) and the quantity of unoxidized residue of protein food in the ' urine is determined . Energy is ' stored in the body as carbohydrate ( glycogen ) and fat , mainly the latter , whenever the food intake exceeds the energy needs of the body , i.e. , when the energy of the food is not all expended in maintaining the vital processes , or in performing muscular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obesity ) . This store of energy , in the form- of fat and carbohydrate , is readily available and will be drawn upon should the energy value of the diet at any time fall below the body 's energy requirements . During a prolonged period of fasting , after the stores of glycogen and fat have been drawn upon and exhausted , the protein of the tissues is utilized to furnish energy . The bomb calorimeter . The potential energy of a foodstuff is determined by measuring the heat evolved when it is burnedtin an instrument known as a bomb calorimeter ( see Fig. 133 ) . The heat generated by the animal body may be determined in a manner identical in principle . Now , the quantity of heat liberated by 1 gram of carbohydrate or fat is the same whether the material is burned in the body or in the bomb calorimeter ; 4.1 Calories are generated in the oxidation of 1 gram of carbohydrate , 9.3 Calories in the // oxidation of 1 gram of fat . Protein , on the other hand , does not undergo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the molecule resists oxidation and is excreted in the urine , mainly as urea ( p. 285 ) . A gram of protein , therefore , evolves less heat when catabolized than when burned outside the body . In the latter instance , 5.3 Calories are generated , in the former only 4.1 . Animal calorimetry . The heat generated by the body may be measured directly direct calorimetry . The animal is placed in a closed chamber with double insulated walls ; coils of copper tubing , through which water is circulated , are situated on the inner walls of the chamber ; thus the heat given out by the animal is absorbed . The temperature of the water as it enters and leaves the chamber is recorded by thermometers . The rise in temperature of the water in degrees centigrade , during the period of observation , multiplied by the total volume of water in kilograms which has passed through the chamber in that time , gives in Calories the heat given off by the animal . A few calorimeters of this type have been constructed for use in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indirect calorimetric methods are employed almost entirely in metabolism studies upon the human subject . Indirect calorimetry . When carbohydrate undergoes combustion in the body the carbon is oxidized to carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) and the hydrogen to water ( 1120 ) . Thus : The body , therefore , reverses the reaction carried out by the green plant which , as already stated , synthesizes carbohydrate from carbon dioxide and water . In the complete oxidation of a given weight of carbohydrate , whether in air or in the tissues of the body , the quantity of oxygen used and of carbon dioxide produced have definite and constant values . // It is also known that for every 1000 cc. of oxygen consumed when carbohydrate is the material oxidized , 5.047 Calories of heat are evolved . That is to say , there is a constant relationship between the quantity of oxygen consumed and the heat evolved . It is evident , therefore , that the heat production of an animal subsisting upon carbohydrate food could be determined , provided that the quantity of oxygen consumed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the heat production varies , however , with the . type of food undergoing combustion . Carbohydrate material is relatively rich in oxygen as compared with fat . Thus , C3H5(C18H33O2)3 is the formula for triolein , a common fat . More oxygen must , therefore , be supplied from a source outside the food itself for the complete oxidation of the carbon and hydrogen in fat than for the oxidation of these elements in an equal quantity of carbohydrate . The consumption of 1000 cc. of oxygen , when fat is oxidized , is accompanied , therefore , by a smaller heat production , namely , 4.686 Calories as compared with the figure ( 5.047 ) given above for carbohydrate . The corresponding value for protein is 4.485 Calories . In order , therefore , to calculate the heat production of the body from the oxygen consumption , one must know the nature ' of the food mixture ( the proportions of carbohydrate , fat and protein ) which is being metabolized . This information is obtained from the respiratory quotient , which will now be explained . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body during a given time , over the volume of oxygen absorbed , is called the respiratory quotient ( R.Q. ) . Thus : Vol . CO2 eliminated R.Q. Vol. 02 absorbed From the equation given on page 276 it will be seen that , when the food undergoing combustion is carbohydrate , the volume of carbon dioxide eliminated and of oxygen absorbed // is equal . When , for example , 100 grams of glucose are oxidized , 75 liters of oxygen are absorbed and 75 liters of carbon dioxide produced . The R.Q.- is therefore ? , ' S = 1 . In the complete combustion of fat , which is relatively poor in oxygen , the volume of oxygen used ( 200 liters per 100 grams ) is greater than the volume of carbon dioxide produced ( 142 liters per 100 grams ) . The R.Q. is therefore ( oo = ) 0.71 . The respiratory quotient for protein is 0.80 and for alcohol 0.67 . On an ordinary mixed diet , the R.Q. of the human subject is around 0.85 . After fasting for 12 hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fattening of farm animals , fat is being formed from carbohydrate , that is , an oxygen-rich material is being transformed into one poor in oxygen , the R4.Q. rises above 1 . The heat equivalents of a liter of oxygen at different respiratory quotients are given in table 13 . These respiratory quotients are for mixtures of fat and carbohydrate only ( non-protein respiratory quotients ) . For very precise work , the Calories derived from the metabolism of protein are calculated separately from the quantity of nitrogen excreted in the urine . But , as a matter of fact , only a negligible error is introduced when the figures in the table are used for calculating the heat production , that is , without any attention being paid to the protein metabolism . The basal metabolic rate ( B.M.R. ) . The heat production of the body 12 hours after the last meal and with the body at complete rest , that is , with the subject lying quietly , is called the basal metabolism or the basal metabolic rate . It is usually expressed in Calories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be determined from either the quantity of carbon dioxide eliminated , or from the quantity of oxygen consumed over a known period of time ; but the figure for the latter is now most commonly employed ( see Fig. 134 ) . The heat value of a liter of oxygen for various metabolic mixtures , as indicated by the respiratory quotients , is given in table 13 . As a rule the R.Q. is not actually // around 50 Calories during the first year , and diminishing gradually throughout life . It reaches the adult value at about 20 years ; from then it declines more slowly , reaching a value of around 36 Calories in old age . The physiological conditions which raise the metabolism are muscular exercise , a low environmental temperature and the ingestion of food , especially protein . The term specific dynamic action is applied to this stimulating effect of food upon metabolism . During sleep the metabolism is lowered by about 15 per cent below the basal level . Among pathological conditions which increase the metabolism are hyperthyroidism ( p. 328 ) and fever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the adrenal cortex ( p. 341 ) and in certain pituitary disorders . THE METABOLISM OF PROTEIN Protein material enters largely into the composition of all types of protoplasm , both of animal and vegetable origin . Among foods , meats ( muscle ) , cheese , eggs , beans and peas ( legumes ) are the richest sources . Its basic elements are carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen and sulphur , and usually phosphorus . Its content of the latter three elements distinguishes it from either fats or carbohydrates , which contain only carbon , hydrogen and oxygen . The body is dependent almost entirely upon protein for its supplies of nitrogen , sulphur and phosphorus . The amino-acids . The protein molecule is made up of a number of amino-acids linked together . Some twenty different amino-acids have been discovered . The simplest of ' these is called glycine or glycocol , which consists of acetic acid in which a hydrogen atom is replaced by an NH2 group . Thus : // The majority of the other amino-acids are constructed upon the same general plan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valerianic , caproic , succinic , etc. , and one or two NH2 ( amino ) groups . An incomplete list of the amino-acids with their empirical formulae is given in the following table : There are several types of protein which contain as many as 15 varieties of amino-acids , but no two proteins contain precisely the same assortment . The total number of aminoacids in a protein molecule may be 200 or more . Such proteins are composed , therefore , of molecules of relatively enormous size . The molecules of certain other proteins , such as the protamines , contain much fewer amino-acids and are correspondingly smaller . There is thus a very wide variation in the size of the molecules of the different types of protein . Egg albumin , for example , has a molecular weight of around 35,000 , whereas the molecular weights of some other proteins are in the neighborhood of 200,000 . A short classification of proteins is given in table 15 . The growth of body tissue in the young animal , and the repair of protein structure in the adult body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the tissue protein of a given animal is different in constitution from the protein of its food , the latter must be completely broken down into // its constituent amino-acids before it can be utilized for building body tissue . The utilization of protein in the construction of body tissue may be compared to the building of a number of houses of different types from materials obtained from the wrecking of other structures . Each brick and stone in the old buildings must be separated , and then sorted and carted to the new sites . Some of this building material will be more suitable for one type of house , some more suitable for other types . Other materials again will not be utilizable at all , and will therefore be discarded as refuse . The new buildings , though constructed from materials taken from the old , will , nevertheless , be quite different in structure and general plan . The amino-acids are sometimes called , not inappropriTHE // ately , the " budding stones " of the protein molecule . Under the action of the erepsin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is completely demolished , in the sense that it is broken up into its constituent amino-acids . The separate amino-acids are absorbed into the blood stream and carried therein to the tissues . Each tissue chooses those which it can make use of , rejecting others . Those aminoacids which can not be utilized by the body are broken up ; the carbon part of the molecule ( i.e. , the fatty acid group ) is oxidized to carbon dioxide and water , thus furnishing energy to the body ; the nitrogen goes to for murea which is excreted in the urine . The removal of the nitrogen group from the amino-acid molecule is called deamination ; this process occurs in the liver . Certain amino-acids not used for the construction of body protein may , after undergoing deamination , be converted to glucose which is then either oxidized or stored in the liver as glycogen ( p. 292 ) . In diabetes the glucose formed from amino-acids is largely excreted in the urine . The diabetic subject , therefore , continues to excrete sugar though he receives no carbohydrate ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is then derived from the protein of his own tissues . The urea in the urine is formed mainly as a result of the deamination of amino-acids composing the protein of the food . Raising the protein content of the diet , therefore , increases the output of urea in the urine and vice versa . But the urea is not entirely derived from the diet ; a small part is formed from the nitrogen released by the breakdown of body protein , for the tissues are constantly undergoing disintegration and repair . Creatinine , another nitrogenous constituent of the urine , is also derived from tissue protein , but unlike urea it is derived almost entirely from this source . Varying the protein of the diet , therefore , exerts little effect upon the excretion of creatinine . A small quantity of nitrogen , combined in various ways , is also eliminated from the body by passing through the wall of the intestine into the feces. // During starvation or upon a protein-free diet the breakdown of body protein of course continues . The body therefore loses nitrogen through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but receives none to make good the loss . That is , the output of nitrogen in the urine and feces exceeds the intake ; the body is then said to be in negative nitrogen balance . Similarly , the nitrogen output will exceed the intake , and the body will be in negative nitrogen balance , if the food protein is inadequate in amount or of poor quality ( i.e. , if its assortment of amino-acids is unsuitable for repairing body protein , the non-utilizable amino-acids being excreted in the urine ) . In the healthy adult , receiving an adequate diet , the nitrogen excreted just balances the nitrogen taken in the food ; that is , the nitrogen lost as a result of the breakdown of tissue protein is replaced from the food ; the remainder of the food nitrogen is excreted . The body is then said to be in nitrogen equilibrium . During growth , after a period of starvation , in pregnancy , in muscular training or in convalescence from some disease which has caused the excessive destruction of body protein , the quantity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , provided the protein intake is adequate . The body is then in positive nitrogen balance . In other words , nitrogen is retained for the construction of body tissue . The " wear and tear " quota of protein metabolism is reduced by carbohydrate food . For example , the nitrogen excretion is considerably less on a diet containing carbohydrate but no protein , than in starvation . The carbohydrate diminishes the breakdown of tissue protein . This is spoken of as the sparing effect of carbohydrate upon protein metabolism . We have seen that only part of the protein molecule can be oxidized in the body and thus provide energy . Civilized man can not subsist on protein food alone , because he can not eat and digest enough to supply the required energy . One gram of protein furnishes 4.1 Calories . A man of averTHE // age size has a daily energy expenditure under basal conditions of about 1400 Calories , and between 2500 and 3000 Calories when engaged in light occupation . Now , lean meat is about 20 per cent protein . Therefore about or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily , in order to obtain from protein the energy required by the body , even at rest . From three to four times this amount of meat would be required to furnish the energy for heavy work . On the other hand , a carnivorous animal such as the dog , which has an energy expenditure of some 600 Calories , can consume two or three pounds of meat in a few minutes and can , therefore , derive its total caloric requirement from such food . The Eskimos are also accustomed to the consumption of relatively enormous quantities of meat and fat . The relative nutritive values of different proteins . Proteins are not all of equal value in nutrition , for the reason that the various types differ widely in their amino-acid constitution . Those which possess an amino-acid assortment most closely resembling that in body proteins possess the highest nutritive value . Generally speaking , these are of animal origin , e.g. , the proteins of milk , eggs and meat . Some proteins , such as gelatin , zein ( in maize ) are incomplete , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for growth , and for the maintenance of nitrogen equilibrium in the adult . Others , such as gliadin ( in wheat ) , hordein ( in barley ) and legumin ( in peas ) , will serve to repair body protein in the adult but will not support growth , since they lack certain essential amino-acids or contain them in insufficient amounts . Animals which receive one or other of these as their sole protein fail to grow . Wheat , peas and barley , however , contain other proteins which make good the amino-acid deficiencies of those which are incomplete ( see table 16 ) . Lactalbumin of milk , and ovalbuniin of egg288 METABOLISM AND NUTRITION white , the proteins of meat and glutenin ( of wheat ) contain all the essential amino-acids . An essential amino-acid may be defined as one which must be present in the diet in order that the growth of young animals shall proceed normally , and that the health of both young and old animals shall be maintained . In a sense , probably all the amino-acids are essential in one way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the body , e.g. , glycine , or formed from others furnished in the diet . PURINE METABOLISM Uric acid ( C5H4N403 ) , a nitrogenous compound present in normal urine and blood , is a purine derivative . Purines are constituents of nucleic acid and this , in turn , is found in the body combined with protein , the compound being called nucleoprotein . Nucleoprotein is present in the nuclei of cells generally , and such tissues as those of thymus , liver , // kidney , pancreas and other glandular structures are particularly rich iii this material . Nucleic acid is constituted of four compounds called nucleotides . A nucleotide contains a molecule each of phosphoric acid , sugar ( a pentose ) and a purine ( adenine or guanine ) or a pyrimidine group . The nucleoprotein of food is broken down by intestinal enzymes into protein and nucleic acid . The latter is split into its constituent nucleotides by an enzyme in the intestinal juice , called nuclease . The nucleotides are absorbed and , through the actions of specific tissue enzymes , are broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving a pentose-purine ( or pyrimidine ) compound called nucleoside . The sugar is then split off . The fate of the purine derivatives , adenine and guanine , only need concern us here . These , as a result of deamination ( splitting off of NH3 ) and oxidation by tissue enzymes , give rise to uric acid . Uric acid is of especial interest ' because in gout , a painful arthritic condition , its excretion is reduced and its concentration in the blood increased . Uric acid , in the form of crystals of sodium urate , is deposited in the tissues surrounding the affected joint . Meats such as liver , sweetbreads , kidney , etc. , which are rich in nuclear material and consequently in nucleic acid , tend , therefore , to aggravate the symptoms of gout . The origin of uric acid is briefly summarized in the following scheme . // CARBOHYDRATE METABOLISM Classification of the carbohydrates . Carbohydrates ( sugars , starches , etc. ) are composed of carbon , hydrogen and oxygen . The last two elements are present in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glucose ( or dextrose ) , fructose ( or levulose ) , and galactose contain six molecules of water and six atoms of carbon , as shown by their formula , C6H1206 . These sugars are , therefore , called hexoses . Though they have a common empirical formula , i.e. , the same number of each type of atom , the positions of the atoms in the molecule differ . The structural formulas of glucose , fructose and galactose are given below for comparison . Glucose is found in fruits and in the blood and tissues of animals . Fructose is the chief sugar of honey . Galactose is present , as a component of the disaccharide lactose , in milk . It is also found as a constituent of certain fatty coinpounds in brain tissue . Other much less common sugars have molecules containing seven , five , four , three or two carbon atoms and a corresponding number of water molecules . They are called heptoses , pentoses , tetroses , trioses and dioses , respectively . Thus a heptose is represented by // the formula C7H14O7 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Octoses , nonoses and decoses , though not known in nature , have been prepared in the laboratory . Sugars belonging to the class just outlined are called monosaccharides , and may be represented by the general formula Cm(H2O)m , in which m has the value 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 and so forth . Disaccharides are sugars composed of two monosaccharide molecules less a molecule of water . Sucrose ( cane and maple sugars ) , maltose ( sugar of malt ) and lactose ( sugar of milk ) belong to this group . Though a disaccharide may be made up of other monosaccharides , these three , which are important food elements and therefore of physiological interest , consist of hexoses either of the same or of different kinds . Their formula is C12H22O11 . They are split ( hydrolyzed ) into their constituent monosaccharides by the actions of specific enzymes in the intestine . Thus ? Sucrose is hydrolyzed into a molecule each of glucose and fructose , maltose into two molecules of glucose , and lactose . into glucose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of monosaccharide molecules , which may be either pentoses or hexoses , less water . The polysaccharides of physiological importance , namely , the vegetable starches , glycogen ( " animal starch " ) , cellulose and dextrins are constituted of glucose molecules , and are therefore given the general formula of ( C6H10O5 ) x . Upon hydrolysis they yield glucose . The history of carbohydrate in the body . Glycogen was discovered by the great French physiologist , Claude Bernard , in 1857 . It is found in traces in most tissues of the body and in fairly large amounts in liver and muscle . Muscle may contain from 0.10 to 1.0 per cent of glycogen and , since approximately one-half the total weight of our bodies is muscle , it will be appreciated that the total quantity of // muscle glycogen is very considerable . The liver often contains as much as ten or fifteen per cent of its wet weight of glycogen and , though it makes up only about three per cent of the body weight , its total glycogen content is comparable with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body tissues ; blood contains approximately 0.1 per cent , but there is considerable variation in the amount in health as well as in disease . It is the most important single carbohydrate with which we have to deal in physiology . As such it can be used as food , passing unchanged from the small intestine into the blood , while complex carbohydrates , such as the disaccharides and polysaccharides ( starches and glycogen ) , must first be hydrolyzed into glucose or other hexoses before they can be absorbed . Glucose ( as well as fructose and galactose ) passes from the intestine into the blood of the portal vein , and is deposited in the liver as glycogen . The conversion of glucose to glycogen is a specific function of the liver cells , and is termed glycogenesis ( literally , glycogen formation ) . The glucose in the blood is maintained at a fairly constant level by the reconversion of glycogen to glucose , which is then discharged into the general circulation . This process is termed glycogenolysis ( literally , glycogen breakdown ) . Muscle glycogen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscular contraction energy is furnished mainly by carbohydrate production ; the glycogen breaks down ; hexose diphosphate is formed which , in turn , yields lactic acid ( p. 400 ) . Lactic acid as well as the three hexoses , glucose , fructose and galactose ? is a glycogen former . A part of the lactic acid produced diffuses into the blood and is deposited as glycogen in the liver , as well as in the heart muscle and certain other tissues . Glucose is also formed from the amino-acids of food protein ; in starvation or upon a protein-free diet it is formed from body protein . This process is carried out in the liver , and is termed gluconeogenesis ( literally , the new formation of sugar ) . // The carbohydrate cycle just outlined may be represented in the following scheme . Oxidation of carbohydrate . While it appears probable that glucose is the only sugar oxidized directly in the tissue cells , there may be some utilization of fructose in this manner . The pathway of oxidation of glucose is still debatable . Insulin and carbohydrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the pancreas ; when this gland is completely removed from animals a condition known as pancreatic diabetes rapidly develops . This is characterized by a high blood sugar ( 0.2 ? 0.5 per cent , as compared with the normal of 0.1 per cent ) , and excretion of sugar in the urine . The extent of the increase of blood sugar ( hyperglycemia ) , and of the loss of sugar in the urine ( glucosuria ) is proportional to the carbohydrate content of the diet , but even on a diet composed entirely of protein , or during fasting , the depancreatized animal excretes a considerable amount of sugar . The sugar reserves of the body , i.e. , liver glycogen , are rapidly lost . Sugar is then made from tissue protein , the animal losing weight as a result . The fat depots are also called upon , but it can not be stated definitely whether the fat is converted to sugar or is always burned directly . At any rate , the increased rate of breakdown of fat results in the accumulation of ketone bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The ketone bodies are j - hydroxybutyric and acetoacetic acids and acetone . The two acids may be regarded as inter294 METABOLISM AND NUTRITION mediate products of the breakdown of fatty acids . Acetoacetic acid possesses toxic properties , and is held largely responsible for the onset of diabetic coma . Acetone is excreted in the breath as well as in the urine ; it is produced by the oxidation of acetoacetic acid in the lungs and bladder . All the signs and symptoms seen in animals following removal of the pancreas are seen in human diabetes which , in most instances , is the result of disease of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas . These structures are solely responsible for the body 's supply of insulin . They can be seen in a section of the pancreas as small groups of cells lying here and there between the pancreatic alveoli . In diabetes there is also an accumulation of neutral fat in the blood . This phenomenon is known as lipemia . The disturbances of carbohydrate metabolism characteristic of the diabetic state may be explained on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ( 2 ) abnormal rate of production of sugar from non-carbohydrate sources . Perhaps both processes play a part . The discovery of insulin has not solved the problem of the etiology of clinical diabetes , but has provided a valuable physiological tool and an effective therapeutic agent . Insulin administered subcutaneously or intravenously eliminates all the signs of diabetes in experimental animals or in human patients . Its action is to promote the storage of glycogen in muscles and liver , to depress the wasteful new production of sugar in the liver , and to increase the oxidation of carbohydrate . The hyperglycemia and glucosuria disappear . Ketosis is eliminated . The rapid loss of body tissues is checked . Insulin has now been prepared in crystalline form ; it is a protein containing eight or more amino-acids . The highly purified insulin is absorbed quickly , when administered subcutaneously , and efforts have been made to lengthen the period of absorption , i.e. , to prolong its action . The most satisfactory preparation thus far developed for this purpose // is protamine zinc insulin , which is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simple protein obtained from fish sperm ( see table 15 ) . While a deficiency of insulin causes diabetes , overproduction is responsible for a clinical condition called hyperinsulinism . The outstanding features of this disease are a low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia ) , and the symptoms incident thereto . A similar condition may be produced in animals by an overdose of insulin . The signs of hypoglycemia are neuromuscular hyperexcitability and hunger . The excitability increases , leading to involuntary twitching of muscles , and later to generalized convulsions . Glucose is the best antidote for an excess of insulin . Other carbohydrates are effective in proportion to their ability to form glucose . Other hormones and carbohydrate metabolism . The relation of other endocrines . to carbohydrate metabolism is dealt with in chapter VIII . The effect of adrenaline is described on p. 337 , of the anterior lobe of the pituitary on p. 348 and of thyroxine and cortin on pp. 342 and 329 , respectively . The nervous system and carbohydrate metabolism . In 1885 Claude Bernard showed that injury to the brain which involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fourth ventricle produced hyperglycemia and glucosuria . It appears probable that these lesions set up nerve impulses which caused the breakdown of liver glycogen . This may be due to direct stimulation of autonomic fibers in the liver or may be an indirect result of adrenaline liberation . It will be appreciated that interference with the nerve supply of any of the glands whose secretions affect carbohydrates may exert a profound influence on the metabolism of these substances . FAT METABOLISM The neutral fats . The common fats of vegetable and animal tissues are compounds of the higher fatty acids , palmitic ( C16H3202 ) , stearic ( C18113602 ) and oleic ( C18H3402 ) // intermediate products a difficult matter . The observations of Knoop in the intact animal suggest that the so-called 3-oxidation takes place , i.e. , that there is successive removal of groups of two carbon atoms . The fact that the ketone bodies , i.e. , those with four carbon atoms , are formed only from fatty acids with an even number of carbon atoms obviously supports the theory of , 6-oxidation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rupture of fatty acid chains takes place at various points in the chain . It is thus apparent that our knowledge of fat oxidation is very incomplete . The digestion and absorption of fat are dealt with in chapter VI . THE REGULATION OF BODY TEMPERATURE The temperature of the human body is determined by placing a thermometer in the mouth , axilla ( armpit ) or rectum . In health the mouth temperature is around 98.6 ? F. The temperature in the axilla is about a degree lower than this , and the rectal temperature about a degree higher . The body temperature does not remain at a constant level throughout the twenty-four hours , but is from 1 ? to 1.5 ? lower in the early morning than in the late afternoon . The cause of this diurnal fluctuation in body temperature is unknown . The body temperature represents the balance struck between the heat generated by the active tissues , mainly the muscles and liver , and that lost from the body to the environment . It is remarkable how constant the body temperature is under varying conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature rises to 100 ? F. or falls to zero , nor does the extra heat produced during light work occasion a rise in temperature . Strenuous muscular exercise may , however , cause a temporary rise in temperature of from 1 ? to 4 ? F. Animals such as mammals and birds ( warm-blooded aniREGULATION // mals ) which can maintain a constant body temperature against variations in the temperature of their environment are called homoiothermic . Those species , e.g. , fish , frogs and reptiles ( cold-blooded animals ) , which are unable to regulate their body temperature are called poi'kilothermic ; their body temperature is that of the environment ( see Fig. 136 ) . Heat balance . It is obvious that the quantity of heat produced in the body ( see p. 274 ) must just balance the quantity of heat lost to the environment . If the body produced more heat than it gave off , the retained heat would cause a rise in temper-ature ; if it lost more than it generated , the temperature would fall . The daily heat production , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is around 3000 Calories . This quantity of heat is dissipated in the following ways . 1 . Radiation , convection and conduction . Through these three physical processes the body , like any other warm object , loses heat to the cooler air surrounding it , and to any cooler objects in contact with it or in its immediate neighborhood . The heat lost in this way can be increased or diminished through variations in the quantity of blood flowing through the skin . On a hot day , for example , the vessels of the skin dilate ; more blood is , therefore , brought from the deeper parts of the body to the surface , and heat loss accordingly increased . In cool weather the vessels of the skin constrict , a greater proportion of the total blood volume is distributed to the internal structures ; heat loss is , therefore , reduced . In very cold weather , though the skin 10 // vessels , generally , are constricted , those of outlying parts , e.g. , nose , ears , fingers , are dilated in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus prevented from freezing . Another important factor is the variation in blood volume which results from changes in environmental temperature . The blood is increased in volume by heat , and is thus capable of absorbing and conveying more heat to the surface of the body for elimination through radiation , convection and conduction . Cold causes the reverse effect , namely , a reduction in blood volume and , in consequence , a diminished heat loss . 2 . Evaporation of water from the lungs and skin . The latent heat of evaporation of water is about 0.6 Calorie , that is , this quantity of heat is absorbed in the vaporization of 1 cc. of water . Under ordinary atmospheric conditions about 500 cc. of water are vaporized from the lungs daily , and about 300 cc. from the skin . This represents a heat loss of ( 800 x 0.6 = ) 480 Calories . It is clear that when the environmental temperature is higher than that of the body , heat can not be dissipated by radiation , convection and conduction ; the body would gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processes . At such temperatures , evaporation of water from the skin and lungs plays the leading role in the regulation of body temperature . The sweat glands are stimulated , and visible sweating appears when a rise in the body temperature of from 0.5 to 1 ? F. occurs . The rise in body temperature may result from an increase in the temperature of the environment or from increased heat production , as in muscular exercise . The effect upon the sweat glands is brought about through a center in the brain from which they receive impulses through the sympathetic nerves . A rise in temperature of the blood supplying the center is the most potent factor in causing the secretion of sweat . This is shown by the fact that heating the carotid artery causes sweat secretion from // the toe pads of the cat , though the paws themselves are kept cool . Sweating may also be induced reflexly , i.e. , from the stimulation of afferent nerves in the peripheral tissues , skin , muscles , etc . In dogs and cats sweat glands are absent from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pads of the . paws . In these animals rapid breathing ( panting ) and , in consequence , increased vaporization of water from the lungs , is relied upon to increase heat loss at high temperatures . 3 . Of the total heat lost from the body , over 95 per cent is eliminated through ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) discussed above . The remaining 5 per cent is lost in the urine and feces , and in raising the inspired air to body temperature . The quantities of heat lost daily in each of the several ways just described are given ( in round numbers ) in the following table . Variations in the quantity of heat lost through these physical factors are capable , under ordinary circumstances , of maintaining the body temperature at the normal level , but at very high environmental temperatures or when , as in strenuous muscular effort , heat production is very greatly increased , the mechanisms of temperature control may be inadequate ; the body temperature then rises . The chemical factors in temperature control . At low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat loss sufficiently to prevent a fall in body temperature . At temperatures below 20 ? C. ( 68 ? F. ) , which is referred to as the critical temperature , // chemical regulation comes into play , i.e. , heat production increases . The body 's fires , so to speak , are fanned . Cold therefore acts as a powerful stimulus to metabolism . The greater heat production in response to cold is brought about mainly by increased tone and , in some instances , Involuntary contractions of the skeletal muscles ( shivering ) , and of the smooth muscle of the skin ( gooseflesh ) . A person when cold usually indulges , also , in some form of muscular activity ? walking , swinging his arms , or stamping his feet ? which very materially increases his heat production ( see Fig. 137 ) . In cold climates protein food , owing to its specific stimulating effect upon metabolism ( specific dynamic action , p. 282 ) , gives valuable assistance to the chemical mechanism - of temperature control . On the other hand , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greater heat production which it induces throws an additional burden upon the mechanisms responsible for heat dissipation . Heat-controlling centers . The main center for the control of body temperature is situated in the fore part of the hypo- // thalamus ? that region at the base of the brain near the origin of the pituitary stalk . Section . through the brain behind this area renders an animal poikilothermic , i.e. , incapable of maintaining the height of its temperature independently of the temperature of its environment . This operation also paralyzes the skeletal muscles ; the power to increase heat production is therefore lost . Stimulation of the center causes a rise in temperature . The center exerts its influence upon body temperature through the autonomic nervous system causing vasoconstriction or vasodilatation , sweating , contraction of smooth muscle in the skin , and the liberation of adrenaline from the adrenal medulla which , as mentioned on p. 337 , stimulates heat production . Fever or pyrexia . A rise in body temperature above the normal level , unless of a temporary nature as in strenuous exercise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature , is called fever . The highest body temperature compatible with life is between 107 ? and 108 ? F. The rise in temperature is due primarily to an impairment of the mechanisms for heat elimination , e.g. , increased blood volume , vasodilatation and sweat secretion , and not to increased heat production . At the commencement of a fever , for example , the skin is pale and dry ; the metabolism is not increased . Heat elimination is reduced ; heat is therefore retained in the body and the temperature rises . Having reached a certain height , the temperature remains fairly steady , for now heat elimi304 METABOLISM AND NUTRITION nation keeps pace with heat production ; a balance is struck , but at a higher level than in health . Though , as just mentioned , increased heat production is not responsible for the onset of the fever , the higher temperature ' induced through heat retention causes , in turn , greater heat production , for the heat generated in the body is the result of chemical reactions , mainly oxidative in nature and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a rise in temperature ( see Fig. 138 ) . A rise of 1 ? F. in body temperature increases the metabolism by 7 per cent . THE VITAMINS It was discovered some years ago that diets composed of purified protein , fat and carbohydrate , and containing the essential minerals would not support life . It was concluded , therefore , that foods in their natural state contained substances which , though present only in minute amounts , were nevertheless essential to life . Sir F. Gowland Hopkins , of Cambridge University , was among the first to suspect the presence of such materials in natural foods . In 1906 he expressed his views in the following words . " No animal can live upon a mixture of pure protein , fat and carbohydrate ; and even when the necessary inorganic material is carefully supplied , the animal still can not flourish . " The chemical nature of these materials was unknown , so they were called simply accessory food factors . Later these vital elements were thought to belong to a group of nitrogenous substances known as amines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found , however , that this conclusion was false , and it was suggested that the terminal " e " be dropped . The generic term vitamin was then generally adopted . There are at least six different vitamins ; each is designated by a letter of the alphabet . The vitamins A , D and E are soluble in fats and fat solvents ( the fat-soluble vitamins ) ; vitamins Bl , B2 and C are soluble in water ( the water-soluble vitamins ) . // Vitamin A ( C20H300 ) , the antixerophthalmic vitamin . The chief sources of vitamin A are fish liver oils ( e.g. , cod and halibut ) , dairy products and certain vegetable foods . The following is a list of materials especially rich in this vitamin . Fish liver oils Butter and cream Egg yolk Carrots , yellow maize ( corn ) , spinach , peas , beans and other yellow and green vegetables It is not strictly correct to say that plants contain vitamin A. They contain a yellow pigment called carotene ( C401156 ) which , after being taken into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A according to the following equation : C40H56 + 2H20 = 2C20H300 Carotene , being a precursor of the vitamin , is called provitamin A. The green and yellow parts of plants contain more of the provitamin than do the paler portions . The content of vitamin A in milk and butter varies with the carotene content of the fodder of the cow . After ingestion the carotene is transformed in part to vitamin A and secreted as such in the milk . A part of the carotene is also secreted unchanged . Vitamin A itself is colorless , so that a pale milk may be just as rich a. source of the vitamin as one more deeply colored . The vitamin A of fish liver oils is also derived ultimately from plant life . Small invertebrates of the sea , known as copepods , feed upon marine plants , and serve in turn as food for small fish . The latter convert the carotene , originally formed by the plant , into the vitamin . Larger fish devour the smaller fish and store the vitamin so obtained in their livers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the provitamin ) , the epithelium lining the respiratory and alimentary tracts , as well as the ducts of certain glands , becomes abnormal . It undergoes transformation to the stratified squamous type . Such mucous surfaces are especially sus306 METABOLISM AND NUTRITION ceptible to infection . Inhibition of lachrymal secretion , followed by drying of the cornea ( xerophthalmia ) , is an outstanding effect of vitamin A deficiency . In some instances softening of the cornea ( keratomalacia ) , which may progress to ulceration and consequent blindness , results . Vitamin A is necessary for the regeneration of the visual purple of the retina which , in health , readily takes place after the eyes have been exposed to light ( p. 467 ) . Night blindness ( hemeralopia ) is , therefore , a common accompaniment of vitamin A deficiency . A sufferer from this disorder sees well in bright light , but is quite or almost blind in dim light . Vitamin A deficiency may lead also to degenerative changes in the long fiber tracts of the spinal cord , and in certain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continent are rarely deficient in vitamin A to the point where serious abnormalities supervene ; but in India , China and other Eastern countries the diet is frequently deficient in this and other vitamins . Also in the lumber camps of the north country , especially during the winter months , and in Newfoundland villages , night blindness and other signs of vitamin A deficiency occasionally make their appearance . Infants reared upon a badly planned artificial diet may also suffer from deficiency of vitamin A ( Fig. 139 ) . The vitamin B complex . Beriberi is a disease of riceeating countries . Its chief features are paralysis of the limbs . ( due to degenerative changes in the peripheral nerves ? polyneuritis ) , dilatation of the heart and edema . It was // shown by Eikjman , a physician working in the Dutch Vest Indies , to be due to a dietary deficiency . He demonstrated that the essential factor which was missing from the diet was contained in the coverings of the rice kernel . Persons who live almost exclusively upon a diet of polished rice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and germ have been removed in the milling process , develop the disease , but are readily cured by giving them unpolished rice or an extract prepared from the rice " poiishings . " This factor in the polishings of rice which protected against beriberi was designated vitamin B or the antineuritic vitamin . From researches of recent years it has been shown that so-calledvita min B is actually a complex // substance consisting of at least two vitamins , only one of which is protective against beriberi . This latter component is called vitamin B1 ; the other is designated B2 ( or vitamin G ) . Other effects of vitamin B1 deficiency are ( a ) gastrointestinal disorders ( e.g. , reduced motility of the stomach and intestines resulting in constipation , inhibition of the digestive secretions and loss of appetite ) , and ( b ) arrested growth ( see Fig. 140 ) . In birds , e.g. , pigeons , a condition analogous to human beriberi results from vitamin Bl deficiency . Its chief features are , paralysis due to involvement of the peripheral nerves ( polyneuritis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is cured in a remarkably short time by feeding a concentrated preparation of vitamin B1 ( see Fig. 141 ) . Vitamin Bl appears to be essential for the metabolism of carbohydrates . In its absence , carbohydrate metabolism does not proceed normally . Lactic acid accumulates in the blood , heart and brain . The accumulation of lactic acid in - the brain substance appears to be responsible for the head retraction seen in birds . Vitamin B2 ( or G ) is almost always found in association with vitamin B1 . An exception is white of egg , which contains vitamin B2 , but not B1 . The effects of vitamin B2 deficiency are disorders of the skin and arrested growth . Pel- // lagra , a disease ' prevalent in the southern United States , and in other countries where maize- ( corn ) meal constitutes the principal article in the diet . of the poor , is thought to be due to vitamin B2 deficiency . The chief features of this disease are inflammation of the skin , particularly of those parts exposed to sunlight , redness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some instances , nervous and mental symptoms . The disease is promptly cured by foods rich in vitamin B2 . The principal sources , of the vitamin B complex are as follows : Bl and B2 Yeast Cereals ( bran and germ ) Glandular organs , e.g. , liver and kidney B2 Lean meat Egg white Vitamin C , the antiscorbutic vitamin . Vitamin C is present in greatest amounts in citrus fruits ( e.g. , lemons , limes , oranges and grapefruit ) . It is also contained in most other fruits and green vegetables . Tomatoes and red and green peppers are exceptionally rich sources ; potatoes , turnips , meat and milk contain moderate amounts . Vitamin C has been identified chemically as ascorbic acid ( C6H8O6 ) ? It possesses high reducing powers , and has been synthesized in the laboratory . Vitamin C serves the important function of maintaining a healthy state of the walls of the capillaries . When it is lacking from the diet , the cement substance interposed between the endothelial cells , and holding them together , becomes deficient . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blood into the surrounding tissues . Scurvy ( scorbutus ) is caused by vitamin C deficiency . The chief manifestation of this disease is bleeding from the mucous membranes , beneath the skin and into joints . 31.0 METABOLISM AND NUTRITION The skin , as a result of numerous capillary hemorrhages ( petechiae ) , may show extensive mottling . The gums are swollen and inflamed , and bleed easily . The subjects become anemic , weak and emaciated . Unless fresh food containing the vitamin is supplied , death results . Scurvy , though unusual in the general population except in times of famine , was a common disease in sailors , soldiers , explorers and others who , of necessity , subsisted upon diets lacking in fresh fruits , , vegetables , meat and milk . Scurvy is readily pro- , duced in guinea-pigs by placing them upon a diet of hay and oats , i.e. , one lacking in green stuffs . The disease is sometimes seen in persons living on the outskirts of civilization , such as lumbermen , especially during the winter months when fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply of vitamin C in concentrated form has not been made . The disease may also appear in infants who are artificially fed ; infantile scurvy ( Barlow 's disease ) should , however , never occur , since the administration of tomato or orange juice is a certain means of prevention . Vitamin D ( C28H44O ) , the antirachitic vitamin . This vitamin is formed by the action of ultraviolet light upon certain waxy compounds known as sterols . Among such compounds are ergosterol , found in yeast , and cholesterol , present in the skin and other animal tissues . The ultraviolet rays cause a rearrangement of the atoms in the sterol molecule , thereby endowing it with the properties characteristic of vitamin D. Vitamin D is formed naturally by the action of sunlight upon a sterol in the skin closely associated with cholesterol , and is prepared commercially by irradiating yeast ( rich in ergosterol ) by means of the mercury vapor lamp or the carbon arc . Such artificial preparations of vitamin D are referred to as viosterol , or simply as irradiated or activated ergosterol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectrum which are effective in the formation of this vitamin have a range of from 250 to 313 m ? 1 ( see Fig. 142 ) . Vita-. // min D has been synthesized in the laboratory . It is a yellow crystalline substance which has been named calciferol . The richest natural sources of the vitamin are fish liver oils , especially those from the halibut and cod . The latter obtain the vitamin from smaller types of fish upon which they feed , e.g. , herring , whiting , etc . The small fish in turn acquire the vitamin from invertebrate ' marine forms , such as copepods and molluscs , which probably synthesize it . Some authorities believe that the cod and certain other fish are also capable of synthesizing vitamin D. The following is a list of the chief sources of vitamin D. Fish liver oils ( e.g. , halibut and cod ) Irradiated ergosterol ( of yeast ) Irradiated milk Irradiation of the skin The main action of vitamin D is upon the metabolism of calcium and phosphorus ; it is essential for the mineralization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composition of the adult skeleton . It also plays an important role in dental health ; defective tooth structure , leading to decay of the teeth ( dental caries ) , results when the diet is deficient in the antirachitic vitamin . When the vitamin in the form of viosterol is administered in excessively large doses , a marked rise in the calcium of the serum ( hyper312 METABOLISM AND NUTRITION calcemia ) results , calcium being drawn from the skeleton to the blood . The calcium of the urine is increased . Vitamin D acts , in this respect , like the hormone of the parathyroid glands . Toxic symptoms resembling those caused by overdosage with parathyroid extract also follow the administration of large amounts of viosterol . The manner in which the vitamin , in physiological dosage , exerts its effect upon calcium metabolism is not altogether clear . According to some it increases the absorption of calcium from the intestinal tract ; its chief action , however , appears to be upon the skeleton , influencing , in some manner not understood , the deposition of calcium and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results from from vitamin D deficiency . It is a disease of young children , chiefly , between the ages of 6 months and 3 years . Its essential feature is defective development of the bones . The deposition of phosphorus and calcium is interfered with ; the bones are therefore soft and yielding . Deformities of the limb bones and spine and defective ossification of the skull bones result . The head is somewhat larger than normal with a prominent brow ; soft areas may be felt in the skull . The abdomen is large and round , which has given rise to the term " pot belly " ( see Fig. 143 ) . The disease occurs most often in bottle-fed infants , especially in those who are growing rapidly and intestinal tract ; its chief action , however , appears to be upon the skeleton , influ- encing , in some manner not understood , the deposition of calcium and phosphorus in the developing bone . // receiving a diet containing a large proportion of carbohydrate . Rickets is readily cured or prevented by the administration of vitamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halibut liver oil , viosterol or irradiated milk , or by exposing the child to ultraviolet radiations ( sunlight , the mercury vapor lamp or carbon arc ) . The value of sunshine in the treatment of rickets was pointed out in 1880 by Palm , an English physician , but it is less than 20 years since the curative effects of ultraviolet irradiation and of cod liver oil have come to be generally recognized . Rickets is seen most commonly in the large cities of northern latitudes , since infants in these localities are less exposed to sunshine than are those in southern climates . The disease is almost unknown in the tropics . The smoke and dust of cities also act as a screen through which the shorter wave lengths of the sun 's rays can not penetrate . It should be remembered , furthermore , that window glass is opaque to radiations shorter than 320 m ? . Sunshine that has passed through ordinary glass therefore possesses no antirachitic action . On the other hand , a person in order to gain benefit from ultraviolet radiation need not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the sky ( skyshine ) , or from water , snow or light-colored objects are effective . Osteomalacia ( soft bones ) is a disease ? essentially the same as rickets ? which is seen in adults in eastern countries , especially India and China . Women are mainly affected with the disease since they , as well as receiving in common with the general population little vitamin D in their diet , are often confined within doors and thus deprived of the benefit of sunshine . Vitamin E ( C29HSOO2 ) , the antisterility vitamin . Vitamin E is necessary for normal reproduction . Female rats upon diets lacking in vitamin E become pregnant , but the embryos , after developing for a short time , die . In male rats vitamin E deficiency results in degenerative changes in the testes ; spermatozoa are not produced and the sex instinct // is lost . The addition of lettuce or other food containing vitamin E corrects the defects of either the male or female reproductive functions . Vitamin E is fat-soluble and has been obtained in crystalline form . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , peas , alfalfa and the germ of various cereals . Wheat germ oil has a very high vitamin E content . The importance of a well-balanced diet for the normal growth and development of the young , and for the health of both young and old , is recognized today as never before . There is little doubt that the finer physique and better , // health of the present generation is largely the result of the more varied and ample character of modern diets ( see Fig. 144 ) . Deficiency diseases which have been so prevalent in the past , especially among the poor , are now comparatively rare . Rickets and scurvy , for example , have almost vanished from civilized communities and , were the knowledge which has been gained from modern research sedulously applied , the eradication of these and other diseases due to defective diets such as beriberi and pellagra ? would soon be an accomplished fact . In planning a diet the following factors must be taken into account : 1 . The caloric ( energy ) requirement of the subject . 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? carbohydrate , protein and fat . 3 . The vitamin requirement . 4 . The mineral constituents . Determination of the caloric requirement . A man of average size and following a light occupation has an average energy output of from 2500 to 3000 Calories daily . In order that the body 's tissues shall not be called upon to furnish any of the required energy , the caloric value of the diet must not be less than the energy expenditure ; otherwise the body would lose weight . Nor should the caloric value of the diet be greater than the energy expended . The excess energy would then be simply stored as fat ( see p. 257 ) . Excess of energy intake over energy output is the usual cause of obesity . In order , therefore , to calculate the caloric requirement in any given case , one must first know the energy expenditure during the resting state , that is , the basal metabolism ( p. 279 ) . To this is added the energy expenditure of the particular occupation in which the person is engaged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same person at . different times , varies widely , depending upon the extent of the exercise undertaken . The energy // allowances for work of several grades are given in the following table . The metabolism during sleep is lower than the basal metabolism by from 15 to 20 per cent . The lower-metabolism of the eight hours of sleep must , therefore , be taken into account in determining the caloric requirements . The calculations just outlined are exemplified in the following table . The basal metabolism of a healthy subject can be derived from his height and weight ( see chart , Fig. 135 ) . The energy values of the various articles of diet are obtained from standard tables , and the quantities apportioned accordingly . For example , beef ( all edible ) has an energy value of about 1300 Calories per pound ; butter yields 3600 Calories per pound , milk 325 , eggs 765 , cheese 2200 , sugar 1860 and white bread 1200 . Children , owing to their greater activity and the requirements of growth , should receive a more ample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average adult . A boy of 16 years , for example , especially if he is growing rapidly and taking part in athletics , requires as much food as a full-grown man engaged in light work . // The proportions of carbohydrate , fat and protein . A little over 50 per cent of the total caloric requirement should be furnished by carbohydrate food , about 35 per cent by fat and 12 per cent by protein . The protein in the diet of the average adult should be from 70 to 90 grams daily , or around 1 gram per kilogram of body weight . Children , especially in the early years of life , require a higher protein intake ( 2 to 3.5 grams per kilogram ) than do adults , and a larger proportion ( 60 to 90 per cent ) of the total protein should be of the highest biological value , such as is furnished by milk , eggs and meat . In adults receiving 80 to 90 grams of protein daily , at least 50 per cent should be first class . If the protein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proteins , the total allowance must be larger . Fat is an indispensable element of the diet . Fats not only contain fat-soluble vitamins , but also certain unsaturated fatty acids ( linoleic and linolenic acids ) which can not be synthesized in the body , yet are essential for normal nutrition . The mineral requirement . Sodium , potassium , magnesium and phosphorus are present in adequate amounts in a diet which is ample in other respects and , as a rule , no special attention need be paid to them . Sodium chloride , for example , besides that which is present naturally in many foodstuffs is added in cooking , and as table salt in quantities determined by individual taste . Protein foods constitute the chief source of the phosphorus of the diet and , when the allowance of protein is adequate , the phosphorus intake takes care of itself . Potassium and magnesium are derived from cereals and vegetables , and are also present in sufficient amounts in an ordinary diet . The minerals in which the diet is most likely to be deficient are calcium , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enters so largely into the composition of bone , is especially likely to be deficient in the diets of children . According to Professor Sherman , children require at least a gram of calcium // per day . The adult requirement is about 0.8 gram daily . As a result of the deposition of mineral in the bones of the fetus , the demand for calcium increases during pregnancy when the intake should be from 1.5 to 2 grams daily . Milk is especially rich in calcium , containing about a gram per quart . Cereals and certain vegetables , such as beans , peas and turnips , are also good sources of this mineral , but the calcium of milk , as compared with that of vegetables , is more readily absorbed . Milk is therefore , especially for children , the best source of calcium . Iron is an indispensable constituent of the diet , since it is necessary for the synthesis of hemoglobin . The daily requirement is from 15 to 20 mgm . The , chief sources of food iron are meats ( especially liver ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beans and peas , whole wheat and oatmeal . Milk is very poor in iron . Copper is also essential for the synthesis of hemoglobin ( p. 33 ) , but the quantity required is so very small that any ordinary diet contains adequate amounts . Iodine is an essential constituent of the thyroid hormone ; goiter ( p. 324 ) results when the diet is deficient in this element . Sea-foods are the chief natural sources of iodine , though many brands of table salt contain small quantities ( 1 part in 100,000 ) which have been added by the manufacturer . The daily requirement of iodine is placed at about 15 micrograms . ' . CHAPTER VIII THE ENDOCRINE GLANDS Introduction . Glands , such as those of the mouth , stomach and intestines , which deliver their secretions into the alimentary tract , or those , such as the lachrymal , mammary and sweat glands , which discharge upon the surface of the body , are called glands of external secretion or exocrine glands . The glands which we are about to consider do not possess ducts or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blood stream , and are thus conveyed to the various tissues of the body upon which they exert their action . These glands are , therefore , called endocrine glands or organs , ductless glands or glands of internal secretion . The secretions of the endocrine glands are for the most part excitatory in their actions ; they stimulate the growth and development , or the functional activity of certain tissues ; internal secretions acting in this manner are , therefore , called hormones ( G. hormao = I excite ) . The term hormone is not , however , restricted to the secretions of the ductless glands . Any substance formed by a tissue of the body and carried in the blood stream to act as an excitant to some other tissue or organ may be called a hormone . Thus , carbon dioxide , which acts upon the respiratory and vasomotor centers , and secretin ( p. 252 ) which causes the secretion of pancreatic juice , come into this category . Chalone is a corresponding term which is sometimes used to designate an internal secretion having an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been advanced enormously during the past twenty years , and especially within the last ten . The methods used in the investigation of endocrine function are three in number . First , an extract 320
