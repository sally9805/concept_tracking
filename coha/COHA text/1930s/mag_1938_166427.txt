Because they saw in their assignment an opportunity to study the whole question of business and its relationships to government , two members of the Congressional Monopoly Investigation committee-Assistant Attorney General Thurman Arnold and SECommissioner Jerome Frank-asked Assistant Secretary of State Adolf Augustus Berle Jr . to suggest a program for the investigators . To nervous , cocky Adolf Berle ( rhymes with surly ) , this assignment was what a murder trial is to a cub reporter . Early in July Mr. Berle completed his " Memorandum of Suggestions . " It was not quite the sort of thing New Dealers hand out to the press , but last week it finally did get into print . <P> In his 12,000-word , 23-page memorandum . Economist Berle ranged far and wide , played no favorites , outlined a program that might well keep the committee in session for at least a decade . " The investigation , " he said , " should be essentially a search to find an organization of business that actually works . . . . " <P> Cautioning trustbusters that mere bigness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite certain " nostalgic reminiscences " was not necessarily competitive or humane . " The village grocery store , the village blacksmith , the village grist mill , were all monopolies . . . . Such competition as there has been , curiously enough , came from large-scale enterprise ; mail-order houses , and later the chain stores . " <P> At the same time , perhaps with a professor 's love for upsetting convictions , B.A. , M.A. , and LL.B . Berle challenged the prevailing belief in the efficiency of large-scale production : " It is familiarly insisted that the old-fashioned farm was an inefficient unit . Yet if , besides the assumed cost of production , there were taken into account the continuity of employment , the ability to use energies of adolescents and of old people , the ability to take care of sickness and give some scope for individual creation and the like , it might prove that ... the old-fashioned farm was one of the most effective units known . . . . " <P> Getting down to specifics , Mr. Berle found the undistributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing large corporations , it gave them a perpetual franchise , not only to stay large , but to be the only large corporations in existence . No small business could grow up to a point where it could give its larger competitors any real battle . " <P> Furthermore , since " small industry does not have the same access to the capital market as does large industry " there should be " a real system of capital credit banks ... a system which would have to be backed by a capital reserve bank . . . able to create credit , and to join in contracting it when necessary . " <P> As for the general program : " It is probably more effective to assist competition rather than legislate the large unit out of existence . . . . Where a high degree of competition will accomplish the result a business system that actually works , that should be the method used . Where a high degree of cartelization under suitable control will accomplish the result , that should be the method . Where quasi-public owner ship produces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
