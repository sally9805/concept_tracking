With French President &; Mme Albert Lebrun , last week French Premier &; Mme Leon Blum went one evening to Paris ' now splendidly refurnished Opera to hear a concert by the London Philharmonic . As fiddles sighed and flutes tootled , there began to be furtive activity in the rear of the Presidential Box . Just in case of another French Revolution , it is equipped as a telephonic nerve centre , attuned not only to Paris but to prefectures of all France , and that night last week trouble was already brewing hot in Clichy . <P> This arrondissement in northern Paris is a factory workers ' district , almost solidly Communist but with a minority of hard-headed little cafe and shop keepers who are tough - or with their middle-class ideas they would not live in Clichy . Some of these shopkeepers belong to the new French Social Party , successor to the bourgeois Croix de Feu league of gentle manly and insipid Colonel Count Casimir de La Rocque ( TIME , April 20 ) . Last week the Social Party hired the Olympia cinema @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Bataille . Communists at once protested . Paris police authorities ruled that entry to the Olympia would be by card only , and that evening a careful police cordon verified that everyone who entered the theatre was , actually a Social Party member , excluding by this means people who might slip inside to provoke a typical Paris theatre political riot . <P> Scowling at these police precautions , Communist cohorts were slowly massing all this time in Clichy . As workers came home from their jobs , they started shaking their large fists , gesticulating and shouting snatches of the Internationale , Everyone was soon aware that many members of the crowd had brought firearms . Up bustled local Communist Boss Maurice Honel of the arrondissement , showing the police his card as a member of the Chamber of Deputies , demanding : " You must permit the citizens of Clichy to form a procession to demonstrate in front of this thea tre ! " Keeping steady , the police commander refused him such permission . At this , citizens of Clichy began flinging paving stones , empty bottles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in baiting police to " strike a woman . " By now the crowd was swelling to an ultimate 10,000 and something like a total of 3,000 police were moving up . Inside the Olympia about 300 Social Party members sat watching on the screen The Battle , while outside battle was already raging or about to rage . From the Opera box of the President , four miles distant , the Premier sent dashing to Clichy his Private Secretary Andre Blumel and his Minister of Interior Marx Dormoy , then sat back to listen , like the true music-lover he is , to the London Philharmonic . <P> It was a real street war or suburban French Revolution by the time Premier Blum 's investigators reached Clichy . The police , fearing a rush by armed workmen into the Olympia and a massacre inside , were now trying to evacuate the 300 French Social Party members and pipe them safely out of the arrondissement through thin police lines stretching through the crowd of 10,000 . The crowd grew so ugly that gendarmes decided to clear the pavement outside Clichy Town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brickbats as they withdrew .
