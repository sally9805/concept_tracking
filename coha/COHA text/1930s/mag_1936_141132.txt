Last week the Congressional drive for adjournment by week 's end was retarded by the death of Speaker Byrns ( see above ) . Senate and House promptly agreed on a seven-day recess during the <P> Republican Convention this week , hoped for quick adjournment next week by the simple process of putting on ice all legislation which has not yet passed both Houses . Major measures slated for discard under this plan were the Wagner Housing bill , substitute Guffey Coal bill , Copeland Ship Subsidy and Pure Food &; Drug bills . By the same principle , at week 's end , only remaining " musts " were taxes and Relief . Easy agreement was expected on the Relief ( First Deficiency ) appropriation bill , which had just gone to conference . Only real threat to adjournment plans was the possibility of a prolonged conference wrangle over the tax bill , passed by the Senate last week with the understanding that many a compromise would be made between the sharply differing House and Senate terms . Meantime , swept along on the adjournment tide to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were : <P> The Hayden-Cartwright bill authorizing $486,000,000 to continue Federal road building in 1938-39 . <P> The Commodity Exchange Control bill regulating speculative trading in grain , cotton , rice , mill feeds , potatoes , butter and eggs . <P> The $526,546.532 Naval Supply bill , biggest in peacetime history . <P> A bill giving the Virgin Islands a measure of home rule , including universal suffrage , a territorial legislature . <P> Bills creating nine new Federal district judgeships in Missouri , Oklahoma , West Virginia and New York . <P> A bill authorizing the Government to pay the equivalent of local taxes on its low-cost housing projects , fix rents lower than previously required . <P> The Omnibus Flood Control bill , authorizing $320,000,000 for reservoirs , dams , levees and spillways throughout the land ; and a complementary $272,000,000 bill , sponsored by Louisiana 's Overton , for flood control in the lower Mississippi Valley . Bursting with political pork , the Omnibus bill was passed by the House four days before adjournment last August , filibustered to death in the Senate by Maryland 's Tydings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pared of its local favors by a stern economy order from President Roosevelt . Called by Senator Copeland " the first porkless water bill ever passed in the history of Congress , " it requires payment of land and damage costs by States or localities , approval of every project by the War Department 's tough-minded Board of Engineers for Rivers &; Harbors.
