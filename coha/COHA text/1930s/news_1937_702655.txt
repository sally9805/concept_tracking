txt Rs a Staff Correspondent of The Christian Science Monitor WASHINGTON . June 10 ? Heavy industry today made its long-awaited demand on Congress for drastic new curbs on organized labor . In the midst of widespread strike disturbances . James A. Emery . general counsel for the powerful National Association of Manufacturers . called on Congress to protect employers and consumers against " unjustifiably interrupted production " and allegedly illegal methods of militant labor ' groups . New responsibilities must be enforced on labor in keeping with new grants of power , he declared . Mr. Emery accomplished a second object of his statement today . His testimony was given before the joint congressional committee considering the new wage-hour bill . and his comment implied that if the new measure is pressed commercial interests of the country will demand it include the checks upon labor which have been urged since the Supreme Court validated the Wagner Labor Act . Emery Comment Pungent The Emery comment was sharp and pungent : " If the Congress is determined to enlarge the field of what has been described as - tinfoil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor Relations Act . we submit that the protection of the public to prevent the arbitrary interruption of production and service now makes it vitally necessary that Congress should consider theestablishment of reasonable social standards and controls of labor combinations in the field of commerce . " We are confronted at present with unjustifiably interrupted production where collective agreements have been made , local disorder is spreading and costly strife will reflect itself in commodity prices . " We can not believe labor organizations of the United States are unwilling to accept the same responsibility to the public within the field of commerce that is properly imposed upon business organizations . We therefore urge that the Congress will consider . if further controlsare to be established in Industry , the necessity of adequately providing public protection against the constant interruption of commerce without just cause . " Restraint of Trade The Emery comment was an attack on the details of the wage-hour bill , although the witness gave a general approval to its objectives . Under the bill , he warned labor , // Rs. a Staff Correspondent of The Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned on in the House and Senate . The big joint Labor Committee , hearing testimony on the wage-hour bill , has been moved from the majority to the minority caucus room , because the latter is air-conditioned and the former is not . Sweltering Washington summer has set in . And yet Congress has just begun its legislative task . There are a dozen big bills facing the Legislature . In fact , taking the past six months as a whole , it has been one long accumulation of work for Congress ? work which barely has been touched . The matter goes back to the time before Congress met and shortly after the 1936 presidential election . Mr. Roosevelt began thinking of new reforms and new laws then , and rarely has a week or a fortnight gone by since without some headlined announcement of a new project . Task Continues to Grow The process has by no means come to an end . Appalled Congressmen thought they had seen the end of things when the Supreme Court reorganization program dropped upon them . Yet the projects continued . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the recent wage-hour bill arrived . But this week there is the new proposal for a $160,000,000 five-year exthe courts might hold that " every strike is a restraint of trade and an obstruction of commerce . " He continued : " Has the time not arrived to require labor combinations to meet reasonable limitations upon their conduct which are essential to protect the public interest in commerce ? " Is it not Just to make it an unfair labor practice for any labor organization to combine to stop production without the previous presentation of a demand or a request . with reasonable opportunity for its consideration ; to call strikes in violation of the terms of any labor organization 's own voluntary agreement or of an arbitration award to which it has been a voluntary party and by the terms of which it has agreed to be bound : to interrupt production by Jurisdictional disputes without referring the determination of the issue for settlement to some higher authority of its own selection within its own national organization ; to call strikes for the purpose of compelling employers , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call strikes for the purpose of preventing operation of any department of the Government or the performance of any of its function. : ; to call sympathetic or general strikes against those with whom the strikers have no dispute ; to strike and occupy or remain in possession of the property of any employer for the purpose of enforcing a demand against him ? " Labor Relationships The Emery statement a as one of the strongaut thus far directed against the bill and the first to raise the question of the new labor relationships . The committee showed little inclination to sympathize with his thesis , but his warnings to labor are thought likely to have some effect on the A. F. of L. and C. I. 0 . in connection with their already somewhat dubious support of the bill . Gen. R. E. Wood , president of Sears Roebuck &; Co. , another witness , warned against drafting the bill in such a way as to centralize factories in cities , or to " freeze " existing economic conditions . penchture for a rejuvenated merchant marine . Senator Joseph T. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has tickets for Europe , speaks hopefully of adjournment by Aug. 1 . But then conies news that Speaker William B. Bankhead of the House has rented a house in the suburbs until Oct. 1 . to which he alit move from his habitual hotel dwelling . The hotel is hot in summer , he points out . Congressmen are weighing these matters . There is still possibility of a hot weather revolt ; quick dumping overboard of " must " or " ought " legislation , hasty enactment of a part of it ; quick packing , and then off to the constituencies and comforts of home or seashore . Washington Is merely simmering with warmth now . It is the preliminary or shirt-sleeve stage . When this capital by the steaming Potomac really gets down to business it can break a filibuster in 48 hours . Or at least it could . The question is. has air-conditioning and the most bewildering deadlock in the New Deal 's history over the Supreme Court reorganization plan finally frustrated even the fiery plodding of summer in getting legislation enacted and Congress adjoin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Congress ? Bills Before Congress Supreme Court Reorganization bill , just on the verge of corning to the floor from committee . The 1938 $1,500,000,000 relief bill ( passed House June 1 now before Senate ) . Power bill  --  authoi motion of 7 TVA 's over the United States . Farm program  --  in committee stage . Reorganization of executisc  --  in committee stage and likely to be limited or dropped at this session Housing bill  --  deadlock between Senator Robert F. Wagner and Treasury over cost . Two-year extension- of nuisance taxes . Investigation of income-tax loopholes . Wages , hours and child labor bill  --  in committee . Merchant fleet construction program . Proposed broadening of social security program . It was with this series of bills in mind that every Congressman found the following significant recommendation in his mail today . It came from the National Grange . It urged : 1 . Quick defeat of Supreme Court bill . 2 . Prompt passage of appropriation bills . 3 . Summer recess or outright adjournment . Congress , it said , should take a rest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
