In Washington last week , the senior officer of the U. S. was Charles Edison , Acting Secretary of the Navy . Every one above him was out of town . But more importantly active than Mr. Edison in Franklin Roosevelt 's absence was Mrs. President Roosevelt , who went to bat cleverly in her column to defend an act of her husband 's which had stirred the country to its grass roots : shifting Thanksgiving Day from the last Thursday in November ( the 30th ) to the next-to-last ( TIME , Aug. 21 ) . <P> Only since 1863 has Thanksgiving had a consistent year-to-year day , but football coaches were furious : 30% of them had games scheduled Nov. 30 which would now play to ordinary weekday crowds . Calendar-makers took the blow quietly except for Elliott-Greer Stationery Co. of Amarillo , Tex. , which happily discovered it had designated Nov. 23 as Thanksgiving Day by mistake . Alf Landon sounded off in Colorado as follows : " . . .

Mrs. Roosevelt reported : " I got a most amusing letter attributing this change to a desire to help a certain race in this country , which is credited , in this note , with doing most of the ' trading ' and which , they say , is not interested in American traditions . . . . But . . . how about remembering how the Yankees always were good traders and perhaps some of them still are in the business !

It is , in fact , the Adonis of salmon . Its regular features , its pink complexion and its rippling muscles make it a fit comrade for the General . " <P> Continued fog , and the necessity of signing WPA authorizations , obliged the President to give up visiting the Labrador coast , turn back across the Gulf of St. Lawrence , head for Annapolis and Washington . <P> Prominently posed with the President for news and newsreel pictures were Franklin D.
