A FLOWER BOX FOR LIZETTE A STORY BY DOROTHY SEAGER T EIE first time Anna saw her she thought she was beautiful , prettier even than Miss Kingsley , her French teacher . As she stepped out of the taxi with the little black dog on his red leash , Anna watched her shyly . She was shorter than Anna by almost a head , and delicate as a doll . She made Anna feel big and awkward in her short cotton dress and her flat-heeled oxfords that were scrubby at the toes . Her hair was brown and wavy under the big hat , and the high heels of her pumps tapped sharply as she went up the steps . Reaching into her bag for a key , she smiled at Anna , and Anna smiled hesitantly in return , unable to believe that so miraculous a person could actually be coming to live here . Such people did n't live on the East Side , or at least not on Cherry Street , which was dirty and smelly even to Anna . The next time Anna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun , stretched out in a bright red and yellow deck chair . The dog was curled up at her feet asleep . Anna slipped back down the stairs to change her middy for her new green sweater , and then she came back , trying to stroll casually past without looking in the direction of the chair . But hearing footsteps , the dog waked up and rushed over to her , his leash dragging behind him . Anna picked up the end of it and turned to find his mistress smiling at her . " He likes you , " she said . " He thinks you 'll walk him round the roof . " " Oh , please , may I ? " Anna said . " Why , of course . " She lighted a cigarette and lay back in the chair again . " His name is Saki , and he 'll be your slave if you 'll play with him . " Anna walked him round the roof several times and then brought him hack . " He 's nice , " she said shyly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sit down , " she said , " and talk to me . I 'm lonely . " Anna sat down at her feet , and the dog curled up beside her . He made Anna feel less shy , and before long she was telling her how she too was lonely because they had always lived in Brooklyn , and now she did n't have any friends because her mother would n't let her stay down on the street very much or go to the movies with boys . " I 'm only fourteen and a half , " she explained , " but everybody thinks I 'm sixteen because I 'm so big . " Just then she heard her mother 's voice booming from the stairs . " Anna , Anna , " she called , " the floors are waiting . " Anna got up reluctantly . " What 's your name ? " she said . " Mine 's Anna Varochnick . " " Mine is Lizette Greene , " the girl answered . " Oh , " said Anna . " What a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Anna is a pretty name too . " And Anna thought to herself that it was a pretty name the way she said it . When her mother said it , or her father , it was An-na , harsh and rough , with the tongue sticking against the roof of the mouth on each n ; but it slipped out of Lizette 's mouth differently somehow and smoothly . " Please come back soon , " Lizette said as Anna turned to go , and there was something more urgent than politeness in her voice . All the rest of that Saturday morning as Anna scrubbed the floors and washed the dishes she said the name over to herself , Lizette Greene , Lizette Greene , and thought how pretty she was . The next few weeks were full of enchanted days for Anna . She forgot that she had ever been lonely or ever been shy of Lizette . Every morning when her father stormed through the rooms in his nightshirt shouting " An-na , An-na , get up , get up ! " she would wake in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few moments why she was so happy . Then it would all come back . It was Lizette ? Lizette who said that her straight yellow hair was pretty , Lizette who gave her a blue scarf because she said it matched her eyes , Lizette who called her meine Anna so that the words seemed to stroke her softly as one strokes a cat . Almost every afternoon when Anna got home from school Lizette would be on the roof if it were a nice day , or if not , Anna would go down to her apartment . Anna liked the days that were n't nice almost more than those that were because she felt so much nearer to Lizette with the four walls close round them and everything else shut outside . Then too Lizette'sapartment was so different from theirs . Instead of four little boxlike rooms , Lizette had one big one that looked out over the river and the bridges , and instead of a clutter of furniture , there were only a few things , a big polished table with no cover over its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of books . The dog became Anna 's special charge , and sometimes when Lizette went away she even Ieft her key with Anna so that the dog and the apartment were all hers for a day . Then she could go down , let herself in the door with a proud sense of possession , turn on the radio , and sitting in the big chair by the bookshelf , pull out book after book , pretending she was Lizette . It was so that Lizette found her one afternoon , her forehead wrinkled over a book of poetry . Anna looked up startled and hastily put the book back in its place on the shelf . She had always left before Lizette returned , and she was afraid Lizette might be angry at her staying so long . But Lizette did not seem angry . Her eyes were bright and she talked very fast , the words tumbling out of her mouth . She did not look like herself but seemed to be encased in a kind of hard shining gaiety . Anna got up to go , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anna , " she said . " I could n't stand it to be here alone . If you could only know how glad I was to walk in and see you sitting there so calmly . " Lizette tossed her hat and purse onto the table and lay down on the divan . For a moment she was quiet , and then she was up and across the room , lighting a cigarette . She turned to Anna . " I saw him , " she said suddenly to her , or rather not so much to her as to the whole room , and she stood defiantly in the middle of it as though she expected a denial . " I saw him and , Anna , I hurt him . I wanted to hurt him . " She walked up and down the floor restlessly while Anna , puzzled by all this , watched her . Then she put out her cigarette , only half smoked , and came to sit on the arm of Anna 's chair . Her brightness was gone now and Anna thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suddenly she took Anna 's face in her two hands , and they lay cold and soft against Anna 's warm cheeks . " Oh , meine Anna , meine Anna , " she said . " I do n't love anyone in the world except you . " And she bent suddenly and kissed her . Anna sat very still in her chair , trying to absorb this new wonder . Lizette had kissed her . It was at once fearful and exciting . All the way up the stairs , across the roof and home , she cherished the memory of it close inside her . As she came in her mother glanced up at her patiently , but her father looked angry . " It is not good , " he said , putting down his paper . " It is not good . Better you should stay at home . " But Anna had not even heard him and she kept on going to see Lizette . One day she asked her why she lived on Cherry Street and stayed so much at home . Lizette laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and because I like you better than anyone else anyway . We 'll spend all summer getting a suntan on the roof , and on nice nights we can walk to the Battery . " Anna sighed in anticipation . " You are really my friend then ? " she asked . " Really your friend , " Lizette answered . " And now go ask your mother if she minds your being a little late . We 'll go to the movies and have a chocolate sundae afterward . " One afternoon when Anna came down after school , Lizette was standing out on the back balcony tugging at ahuge window box . " Look what I 've found , " she called . " A flower box . If we can find some earth somewhere we can grow flowers in it . " Anna climbed out after her and with one pull of her strong arms lifted the box through the window . " My father gets earth for my mother 's plants . When he comes home from work I 'll ask him , and we can go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Lizette said . When Anna asked her father he was loudly scornful . " Sure I know where you can get soil . Just go over to Jackson Park and take all you want . But you wo n't find her messing in it . " Anna found a pail and was hunting for a spade when her father came back into the kitchen . " What for you need a spade ? " he said . " Is she too good to pick it up with her hands ? " And he handed her an old kitchen knife . Anna took it from him and bent quickly over the pail to hide her face from him . " There 's nothing to cry about , " he said . " But it is not good . She could be your mother and you all the time running round with her like she was a kid . " Anna lifted her head . " She 's my friend , " she said . Her father snorted and went out of the kitchen . Anna took the pail and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Lizette 's apartment . But she was troubled . It was not true that Lizette was as old as her mother . It could n't be . She thought of her mother , slopping round in old bedroom slippers , always cooking or scrubbing or ironing , her face greasy and hot . And then she thought of Lizette cooking supper for the two of them as though it were a new game  --  her ruffled apron  --  the things they had to eat , strange things with funny tastes  --  the pretty porcelain dishes . No , Lizette could never be as old as her mother . Lizette was waiting for her , and they ran quickly down the long flights of stairs and out into the street . It was just beginning to grow dusk , and as they watched , the lights on the bridge winked suddenly out at them from the soft haze that hung over the river . Walking along South Street beside Lizette , Anna felt the older in spite of what her father had said . She was so much bigger , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxfords like Anna 's own , skipped along the street beside her , sniffing at the stables and stopping to pat the nose of every big work horse that stood patiently at the curb waiting for his supper . " It 's an adventure , " Lizette said . " We might even be arrested . " " I do n't know about that , " Anna said . It would never have occurred to her that going to Jackson Park for a pail of earth could be an adventure ; but with Lizette beside her and the pail swinging between them it really did seem to be strange and exciting . When they reached the park it was quite dark . The water lapped softly against the stone embankment and in the sky was a huge moon that shone in a broad path of light right across the water , almost to their feet . In the Navy Yard across the way a battleship covered with silver paint shone in the moonlight . There was an immense sweep of sky all around them , and Lizette pointing out the stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful , " she said happily . " And I 'm certain none of it is real . The moon , the battleship  --  perhaps even we are n't real . " But Anna , not forgetting why they had come , was scouting about for a spot where they could fill the pail . When she had found a place sufficiently secluded they sat down on the ground and began to dig . Anna dugwith the knife , loosening the earth , and Lizette scooped it out in her hands . Anna was glad for that , although it was strange to see Lizette 's hands grimy with the black earth . Lizette held a handful of it up to her nose . " It 's real earth , " she said . " It does n't smell a bit like New York . " As they dug and scooped the hole got deeper and deeper . Lizette squatted back on her heels and laughed . " I feel just like a puppy , " she said , " and I know I look like one . Suppose a policeman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people wandered past them in the dark , but no one paid much attention to them there on the grass digging their hole . Lizette pushed her beret back on her head and scooped industriously . At last Anna got up her courage . " How old are you ? " she said . Lizette glanced up quickly with an odd look on her face . Even in the dim light of the street light Anna could sec it , a sort of frightened look . Then Lizette laughed . " I 'm terribly old , " she said . " At least you will think so . I 'm twenty-eight . But let 's not think about that . Let 's leave the pail here and we can go sit by the water and look at the moon some more . " Anna was sorry she had asked her . Twenty-eight was terribly old . Fourteen from twenty-eight . Why , Lizette was twice as old as she was . When Anna was a baby , Lizette must have been her age . It made her seem so much less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already jumped to her feet . " Come on . I 'll race you to that farthest bench , " and she was off before Anna 's slow mind had hardly grasped the idea . Anna ran fast but Lizette was so much lighter and swifter that she was there ahead of her . The moon was higher now and a deep yellow . And it was the biggest moon Anna had ever seen . Lizette reached out and took Anna 's hand as they sat side by side on the stone wall with their feet swinging over the edge . " You must n't mind that I 'm old , " she said . " I can still be your friend . I was very lonely and unhappy when I came down here to live . I was in love and it did n't work and I ran away . " She was quiet a moment , looking at the water . " If it had n't been for you , meine Anna , I should have come over here some black night and slipped in . " Anna said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand round Lizette 's . She did not exactly understand what Lizette was telling her , except that she was in some way necessary to her happiness , and that she must be protected from these things that frightened her . That was enough , and suddenly love for Lizette swept through her in a great wave so that she was afraid she was going to cry because she was so happy . Ahead of them stretched a whole summer , the flower box to be planted , long sunny afternoons when she need n't go to school and could sit on the roof with Lizette , long summer evenings when they could walk to the Battery or go to the movies and eat chocolate sundaes at the drugstore on the corner . She would get her mother to give her slips from all her plants , perhaps even some of the plants themselves , and the flower box would bloom all summer because Anna herself would plant every flower and water them every day . She sighed in contentment . All those lonely afternoons when she had sat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and down the river were gone because there was Lizette . The moon was high and golden in the sky as they walked slowly back down South Street , holding the heavy pail between them . Anna carriedmost of the weight because she was so much taller , but she did not mind . She would have liked to carry it all because Lizette was so small and so nice . When they got home , under Anna 's direction , they spread papers over the kitchen floor and poured the earth onto them . On their hands and knees they went through it all , sifting it carefully between their fingers for stones and worms and pieces of brick and glass . Then Anna poured it into the box , but when she was finished the box was only half full . She looked up at Lizette happily . " We 'll have to go again , " she said , and it seemed to her that nothing in the world could be so nice . " So we shall , " laughed Lizette , " and very soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was late when Anna got home , and her father looked up at her sharply . " Well , did your pretty lady dirty her hands ? " he asked . " Yes , " said Lizette proudly . " She got them very dirty , " and went off to bed . The next day when Anna climbed up to the roof to find Lizette she was not there . She went down and knocked at her door , but there was no answer . The dog barked unhappily and scratched at the door when she rapped , but that was all . Anna felt very sad and went back to sit in the sun alone . The next day when she went down Lizette was just going out . She looked strange . Her face was white and she smiled at Anna vaguely . " I 'm going out , " she said . " I 'm sorry I ca n't come up . " A sudden fear tightened Anna 's throat so that she could hardly speak . " But the flower box , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soil . " Lizette locked the door , and put the key in her bag without answering . Then , " Oh , yes , " she said . " It will have to be later this week . " And she started towards the stairs . " But Lizette , " Anna begged . " We must go soon or the flowers will never grow . " Lizette turned back from the stairs . She thought for a moment . " All right . How about Wednesday then ? " " Sure , " Anna said happily , a little ashamed of her insistence now , " Wednesday after supper . One more pail will fill the box and then we can start planting . " Wednesday was only two days away but Anna thought the time would never pass . Tuesday night she wandered about the apartment until her father shouted at her . " You see , " he said , " it 's like I thought . Every minute you 're away from her you fidget . For God 's sake , sit down and keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anna sat down , but nothing her father said could make her unhappy . She got out an old seed catalogue and a pencil , and Lizette 's flower box bloomed a dozen different times in a dozen different ways . She looked at all her mother 's plants , and when her father had gone out for a pail of beer , she got up courage enough to ask her if she might have some of them for Lizette . Her mother looked at her sharply too , but said pleasantly enough that with so many she guessed a few could be spared . " She 's older than you , " her mother said , evidently trying to say something else she did n't know the words for . " I know , " Anna said smiling . " But it 's all right . She 's my friend . " " M-m , " her mother said , and added something in Russian which Anna did n't understand . On Wednesday night Anna waited as long as she could , knowing that Lizette always had supper much laterthan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and got out the pail . At the last minute she went to her mother 's plants , and working her fingers gently into the earth , she dug out a marigold plant . It had delicate green leaves that curled around the little yellow blossoms , and it was so small that she could hold it on the palm of her hand . It was like Lizette somehow in its small perfection . She wrapped it carefully in a piece of newspaper , being certain that enough earth clung to its roots so that it would surely live . It would be a bad omen if the first thing to be planted in Lizette 's flower box were to die . Then catching up her pail she ran up to the roof and down the stairs to knock at Lizette 's door . For a moment there was no answer . Then Lizette opened the door . " Oh , it 's you , " she said . " Come on in . " But Anna stood awkwardly in the door holding the pail and staring into the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her curiously through a fog of cigarette smoke . All their talk and laughter had suddenly stopped and they sat , their glasses in their hands , staring at her . She blushed crimson with embarrassment . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " I thought . . . 1 mean , this is Wednesday . . you know , the soil . . . " While she was speaking a young man had come to the door and was standing beside Lizette , one arm thrown possessively across her shoulders . He was very tall , much taller than Lizette , and taller even than Anna . He had dark curly hair and a pleasant smile . " So you 're Anna , " he said . " Do you mean to tell me that you and Lizette actually go to Jackson Park and dig dirt out of it ? " He laughed as though he found that extremely funny and went on . " Well , even if you did , she ca n't go with you to-night . In fact , " and he smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere again unless I say so . You see I 'm going to marry her before she runs away again . " Anna stared at him stupidly and her hands clenched the handle of the pail in rage . He did n't have any right to come here on Wednesday night and spoil everything . He did n't have any right to put his arm round Lizette that way . And most of all he did n't have any right to laugh at the night she and Lizette had gone to Jackson Park . She hated him , and surely Lizette must hate him too . Anna turned to her . But Lizette was smiling up at him happily , and Anna saw that this was a different Lizette , one she did n't know at alt . It was n't so much the dress , though it was beautiful , falling in long green swirls all the way to the floor , but there was a new look about her face , in her eyes , so that even as she looked at Anna and smiled at her , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anna , very conscious of her sneakers and the middy and the pail , backed hastily out of the door . " Good-by , " she said . " We can go some other night , " but as she said it the tears choked in her throat , and she knew they would never go again . Up on the roof it was cool and dark and the wind blew softly against her cheeks . The tears rolled out of her eyes now and tasted salty , as she sat on the wall and watched the lighted trains crawl back and forth through the bridge like caterpillars . In all her life she had never been so unhappy . The windows in Lizette 's apartment were open so that the sound of talk and laughter floated up to the roof . Looking up , Anna saw the moon beginning to rise slowly , only now it was n't round and full any more , but oddly shrunken on one side like a balloon with the air going out of it . She wanted to go home , but she could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't gone for the soil . In her hands she found the paper parcel with the marigold plant . For a moment she stared at it and the flowers were golden like the moon the night they had gone to Jackson Park . Then she leaned across the wall and dropped it over the side of the building . The newspaper floated away from it and she could see the yellow flowers dropping down and down to the street . After a while she heard voices below her and Lizette 's , high and sweet , among them . She leaned over the edge to look at them . In the light from the doorway she could see them getting into a car . Then she saw Lizette come down the steps . She had a soft black coat over her dress , and was holding up the long full skirt delicately in one hand . The same young man was holding her other arm and smiling down at her . Anna shut her eyes tightly but the tears squeezed through anyway . For a moment she heard the motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sound of the engine growing fainter and fainter as it mingled with the river noises . When she could no longer distinguish it , it seemed to Anna that the street was quieter than it had ever been before , that time itself had stopped with Lizette 's going . She picked up her pail and went slowly across the roof and down the stairs . Her father was reading the paper when she came in . " Is n't it wonderful ? " she said to him in a firm blight voice , " Lizette is going to get married . "
