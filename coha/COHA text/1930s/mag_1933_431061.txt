 | Golden Days for Gold Condensed from Fortune ( June , ' 33 ) IN THE SPRING a Canadian 's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of gold . Since most of Canada 's known gold is up in Northern Ontario , it is only in the summer months that prospecting can be carried on and new mines opened up . This year a miraculous possibility looms ahead . All good gold miners in North America have long prayed every night for just one thing : that the Congress of the United States will some day decree that 12 grains of gold shall constitute one dollar . Since this is one-half the present gold content of the dollar , such a law immediately doubles the income of every gold mine in Canada . It is true that with devaluation commodity prices and wages ( and with them mining costs ) also rise . But the rise in gold is instantaneous , the rise in commodities gradual , and the mining companies make a pretty penny out of the economic lag . As all Canadians and few Americans know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , and is now second only to South Africa as a gold-producing nation . Of the $63,000,000 worth of gold produced by Canada in 1932 , $47-ooo , ooo came from one province : Ontario . And all of this with the exception of some $2,000,000 came from two great gold-mining districts set like rich jewels in the barren wilderness . For two decades " Kirkland Lake " and " Porcupine " have been names glamorous with gold . What with the tapping of rich new veins , they are more glamorous today than ever . The subject of gold must be split into two parts : mining and prospecting . The focal points of Canadian gold mining-which is as much an industry as coal mining - are the great camps at Porcupine and Kirkland Lake . To get to this industrialized gold region you can take a train that leaves Toronto at 9.3o every evening and arrives in Timmins , metropolis of the Porcupine district , at 5:3o the next afternoon . r you can fly there in a 425-mile beeline from Toronto in less than four hours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a great table , so flat that water is without ambition and lies where it falls , in thousands of lakes . As you fly over your first gold mine you will see a group of stark , galvanized-iron buildings , with shacks huddled around a structure which looks like a distorted grain elevator .  | Ontario 's gold is found in veins of white quartz which dip deeply into the ground . No one knows how far down some of them go - several have been followed a mile straight down . A " vein " is a flat plane rather than a tube . Tilt a layer cake on an angle and cut it in half and you will have a rough diagram of a gold mine . The filling is a vein embedded in the barren waste of dough . The vein may be easy to follow . The bright white quartz stands out sharply against the darker rock . You may or may not see gold in it . If you do , it will usually be in tiny , pinhead flakes which have a dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye can easily tell from yellow iron-pyrite crystals ( fool 's gold ) . Once a vein has been discovered and its richness , dip , and direction established , deep gold mining is a simple engineering problem . The big Ontario mines usually have their work blocked out three to five years in advance and can therefore make investments in heavy machinery . If the vein is lost and the engineers can not find it again - and several thousand feet underground it is a blind hunt - the mine is done for . But many of the big mines are going stronger than ever after decades of production . Of course , every gold mine comes to an end sooner or later . For the farther down you go , the hotter it gets , the more artificial ventilation is needed , the more dangerous becomes the pressure of rock and , as a result of all these , the more it costs to get the ore to the surface . But before gold can be mined it must be found , and prospecting is still just as insanely erratic a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackened the stream beds of the Yukon . Ontario 's active Department of Mines makes every effort to increase the number of prospectors ; it recently estimated that 200o prospectors were actively at work in Ontario alone , and last year 500o gold claims were staked out in the province . The ideal prospector , according to the Department , is ( i ) an expert woodsman , ( 2 ) a competent geologist , and ( 3 ) a confirmed optimist . Certain mining companies send out prospectors year after year , but they do not always find gold . One company has spent s500,000 on prospecting to date , and has found nothing . During the winter the prospector makes his arrangements for the summer . The standard deal is for his backer to pay him  |p5o  to $25o a month for the seven summer months , supply his grubstake , and transport him to the starting point of his trek . He also gets a ro% to 25v interest in any claim he stakes .  | He pays 5 for a license from the province and a set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The prospector may set out from the railhead with a light canoe slung on his back or he may be dropped on a wilderness lake by an airplane which has a date to pick him up again in the fall . Each prospector may stake three claims for himself and six more by proxy . He is allowed 40 acres to a claim , and after staking it with his tin pegs , he must trek all the way back to the nearest mining recorder and , not more than 2o days after staking , record his claim . Within three months he must do 3o days ' work on the claim . After 4o days ' work a year for five years , or a total of 200 days in the period , the claim is eligible for patent at $3 an acre . A mining camp comes into being somewhat in this manner . The prospector comes back to record his claim . His backers send him out again with ten or twenty men and some dynamite to blast out some of the veins . If these results are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are drilled . All these steps are maneuvered by airplane . If the test drillings are encouraging , a permanent camp is set up . The heavy equipment - hoisting and milling machinery - is loaded on barges , towed up lakes , and hauled by rope across portages- Meanwhile , a road is being built . News of the original strike has caused other claims to be staked around it , and soon a boom town has materialized . Shopkeepers , prostitutes , and liquor all come in by plane . But although the new camp is in the Forty-niner tradition it is much more orderly . The policing is done , and well , by Staff Sergeant Turnbull , who stands six feet four and who is the only policeman in the whole region . He covers his beat , which is hundreds of miles square , in the planes operated by General Airways , Ltd. of Toronto . It would be only a slight exaggeration to say that the current gold rush in Northern Ontario would be impossible without General Airways , which is just about the most reckless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter it lost just three flying days , which means that its pilots , as they grinningly admit , flew many a day with zero ceiling . But in its more than five years of flying existence General Airways has never lost a plane or caused an injury to any passenger or pilot . The company was founded by A. Roy Brown , one of Canada 's premier aces and the man who was credited with shooting down Richthofen . The North Country is ideal airplane country , dotted with innumerable lakes which  | make landing fields unnecessary . Planes land on pontoons in the summer , skis in the winter . The country is devoid of prominent landmarks and so widely mineralized that compasses do not work . It drives foreign pilots out of their minds , but the General Airways skipper finds his way around by following high tension lines , the railroad , the shape of the lakes . A century hence General Airways ' chief pilot may well be a legendary figure in the North Country . He figures in all the contemporary lore of the region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his middle twenties . His name is Wilson Clarke but even the Indians know him as Clarkie . He knows every human being in the North Country , spends his nights drinking with them and his days flying them . From his casual conversation one learns of his adventures : searching for a missing prospector , landing on a two-by-four lake to get him , missing the tree tops by inches in taking off again . In one load Clarkie carried two Indians dying of tuberculosis and Sergeant Turnbull with two New York trollops he had arrested for being drunk and disorderly . Many of Clarkie 's flights are mercy calls , with no prospect of reward this side of heaven . His only regulation : winter passengers must be dressed warmly enough to be able to walk home without freezing . But no one has had to walk as yet .
