Though Russia stood fourth in gold production before the War , the Soviet Union last year produced a full 200 tons of the metal , the second highest gold production in the world , exceeded only by South Africa . Russia 's army is the largest in the world , one of the best equipped . It was no surprise to anybody last week to learn that bigwigs in the Kremlin had decided to spend some of Russia 's new gold on building up her long-neglected navy , but eyebrows shot up over one item in the new naval program . <P> The Soviet Fleet contains only three battleships , each 26 years old . Besides plans for more submarines , cruisers , destroyers , Moscow announced that two new dreadnaughts would be built , each of 35,000 tons , equipped with 16-inch guns . <P> A battleship is not only bigger than a destroyer , it is a thousand-fold more complicated . Comrade V. M. Orlov , chief of the navy department , admitted last week that there were neither yards nor designers in Russia today capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : one battleship would be ordered from the U. S. to be shipped to Russia knocked down in separate parts , accompanied by a force of U. S. naval architects and technicians . On Soviet shores the parts would be duplicated , then both battleships would be screwed together . <P> Investigation in Washington found much truth in the story . Russian agents have talked with Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp . Ltd. , Newport News Shipbuilding &; Dry Dock Co. and New York Shipbuilding Corp . The State and Navy Departments have been approached for consent to the plan . Because Russia is not a belligerent in any war , the State Department would be forced to grant licenses , the Navy Department 's only objections being that they would not allow the shipping abroad of 16-in. guns , a U. S. specialty , nor may Navy proving grounds be used to test the quality of guns or armor plate . But 15-in. guns , big as those on H. M. S. Hood would be quite all right . Shipyard rumors last week gave Bethlehem the contract . Within 18 months Comrade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of a series of shipments that will include everything from turrets , barbettes , gears , pistons , armor plates , electric hoists , turbines , boilers , stanchions , steampipes , searchlights , smokestacks to a davit for the Captain 's gig .
