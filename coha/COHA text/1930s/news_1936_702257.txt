txt The Van Sweringen Railroads Following the sudden death of Oris P. Van Sweringen , much has been said about the wonderful recovery of the various railroads of which the Van Sweringens secured control . Nothing has been said either in praise or blame of the man upon whom they depended for practical knowledge in railroad operating matters , as they often testified , John J. Bernett , formerly with the New York Central Lines . When I first knew him he was an official of the Michigan Central . Mr. Bernett died a comparatively short time ago , and it does not seem fair to ignore the practical operating man who made possible the success of the railroad systems which the two brothers controlled as financiers , for they did not hesitate to say often that with Mr. Bernett as their expert they felt assured of well-conducted and directed properties . THOMAS C. POWELL . New York , Nov. 26 , 1936.
