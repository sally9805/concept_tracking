In the days before the phonograph , composers who wanted to have their music preserved for future generations had to write it down on paper . Now , thanks to recording machines , music can be engraved directly on the surface of wax discs , preserved as permanently as sculpture . The best swing music is not written down ; it is improvised . Before the phonographic era , improvisation was as impermanent as a cloud of smoke . Today the woodnotes wild of Benny Goodman 's clarinet can be made as durable as a Chopin nocturne , and copies can be distributed by the thousands . <P> Composers have viewed this change in the mechanics of their art with mixed emotions . Some throw up their hands and declare that the art of composition is done for . Others see the possibility of a new method of composing , envision composers of the future short-cutting to sound itself , creating not compositions on paper , but recordings in wax . <P> Prominent among the pioneers in this new field of composition is Raymond Scott , a Brooklyn-born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the Big Ten of U. S. danceband leaders . Composer Scott , whose real name is Harry Warnow ( originally Warnofsky ) is the creator of a dozen-odd recordings ( Twilight in Turkey , Powerhouse , War Dance for Wooden Indians , etc . ) . His music , whose deliberate jazz style is so sophisticated that it seems almost a caricature of jazz , has attracted the attention of such musical bigwigs as Igor Stravinsky . Last week Bandleader Paul Whiteman devoted the best part of his CBS broadcast to Scott 's dry , sharp-rhythmed music . <P> With the help of his " quintet " ( which consists not of five , but of six instrumentalists ) , Composer Scott has recently created a " jazz laboratory " at CBS . Here , with recording equipment , engineers and arrangers at his disposal , he is continuing his curious task of building music directly for the microphone . His method is to start one player on a rhythm or a phrase of melody , add another instrument , adjust the balance between the two , throw in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and simmer the resultant mixture until ready for recording . With the help of recordings and re-recordings he can finally work up this concoction into a sort of musical composition . <P> Something of a wag in a field where well-considered waggery is always good publicity , Composer Scott has long been notorious for his absentmindedness , his incredible stories about himself ( " I tell people I do things , and they believe me , " he complains ) and the goofy titles he gives his works . Sample : Dinner Music for a Pack of Hungry Cannibals . Of his wife , who carefully checks over all his compositions , on the lookout for unintentional plagiarisms , he says , " She 's a regular musical blotter . "
