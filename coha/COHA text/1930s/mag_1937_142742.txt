Parliamentary government replaced feudalism in Japan in 1890 . The new system creaked along until 1932 when Japanese Army officers put an end to party government by killing Ki Inukai , the last party Premier . The Japanese Army has dominated every Tokyo Cabinet since the outbreak of the Manchurian War ( September 1931 ) . <P> Handlebar-mustached Senjuro Hayashi , leader of the " Gold Braid Cabinet " of generals and admirals which took office last January , was Japan 's No. 1 exponent of military aggressiveness . In four short months the gold braids outraged the civilian party politicians , high-handedly suspended the Diet 's lower house , forced an election , lost it but insisted on staying in office ( TIME , May 10 ) . <P> With the country against them , the Cabinet began to accuse Premier Hayashi of bungling what they had hoped would be a coup d'etat to entrench them more firmly . Last week he knew the game was up , resigned ( TIME , June 7 ) . <P> The political parties , the Japanese electorate and the Emperor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had at last turned . As always before choosing a new Premier , the Emperor immediately got in touch with 88-year-old Prince Kimmochi Saionji , last of the Genro ( elder statesmen ) who advised the late great Emperor Meiji . The ancient Prince had the very man groomed for such an emergency - dapper 45-year-old Prince Fumimaro Konoye , president of the House of Peers , an independent , nonparty aristocrat who was nominated for Premier three years ago while he was in New York taking the temperature of the U. S. about naval disarmament . He was then prevented from accepting by Prince Saionji because the time was not ripe . <P> Prince Konoye , though inexperienced in administration , promptly accepted this time . Within a few hours he sat down before a telephone , rang up the prospective ministers of what was soon tagged " The Telephone Cabinet . " From the first , one thing was clear : the military Government could not be replaced by an out- &-out; liberal one . In a brief radio speech in which he revealed an attractive radio personality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heal strife and eliminate friction . " This meant that he had to conciliate the Army , recognize the disgruntled civilian parties , win the sympathy of the electorate . <P> Within two days the Premier had his Cabinet lined up-the broadest , most nearly " national " in Japan 's history . In it were a count , two army and navy men , an airplane manufacturer , eight civilians ( five of them from the House of Peers , two from the Diet 's major parties ) . As chief secretary of the Cabinet the Premier chose Akira Kazami , a minor politician with no money . Kazami was as surprised by the appointment as the rest of Japan . With a deep belly laugh he roared : " Ha ! Ha ! Wisdom is not in my line ; neither is money . Turn me upside down and you wo n't get even a nosebleed . " <P> Lieut. - General Gen Sugiyama , War Minister in the Hayashi Cabinet , kept his job after getting a promise from the new Premier that national defense would be strengthened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cautious , 59-year-old Koki Hirota , onetime Premier , onetime Foreign Minister , returned to the Foreign Office-a popular move .
