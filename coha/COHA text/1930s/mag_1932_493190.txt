Mr. Lewis ' Uncle Billy Sherman , Fighting Prophet , by Lloyd Lewis . New York : Harcourt , Brace and Company . 702 pages . $3.50 . IT HAPPENS that I grew up in the planter region of Mississippi , close to memories of the two great Northern generals , Grant and Sherman . With the years going by , I have had the chance to see them through a series , as it were , of perspectives ; and my view of General Sherman , and , as a by-product , of this new history of him , may gain from that fact a certain relevance , however minor . It will at least serve as a tiny straw in the wind of his persuasive greatness . As a child , growing up in the shadow of the War between the States , not wholly lifted even today , these are some of the things I was reminded of ; I will try to put them briefly . ' Their point , in no sense malicious , will soon appear . In December , 1862 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the home of an uncle-by-law of mine , Jacob Thompson , who had been Secretary of the Interior under President Buchanan ; General Sherman , in his memoirs , mentions the comfortable house . At the end of the visit the soldiers set fire to the house , Mrs. Grant found the diamonds that had been hidden under tissue paper in a flowered vase on the mantel-Piece , and the soldiers roared away through town with the Washington society gowns over their horses ' heads . In the meantime , Mrs. Grant had looted not a little around town . One of our friends , a lady whose marriage had been put off when her betrothed was rushed away to the war , told me how one day she heard an altercation in her room upstairs and went to find Mrs. Grant kneeling there at a commode in which.were the embroidered linens , bought in New Orleans for the trousseau ; the discussion turned on whether she or the soldier standing by had the right to the find , she as the general 's wife , he as the finder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the **37;284;TOOLONG . The house of my great-uncle was one day entered by Colonel Osborn of the Eleventh Illinois , with his company of Negroes , who dragged the owner , seventy-five years old , out by the collar , knocked his wife down with a saber , and so treated a daughter , who was enceinte at the time , that soon her Child was born and a few days later died . At a friend of 1/137 father 's , the soldiers , seeing a new-made grave in the family graveyard and thinking valuables might be thus hidden , dug it up , kicked the coffin open and left his mother 's body lying there . Another of our friends , Mr. Wilkinson , then a boy of fifteen , standing on the gallery of his home to watch the marching past , had a pot-shot taken at him , which hit his leg ; while down the same street , at Illy cousin 's , a little darkey boy had climbed up into an apple tree to see , and in a merry jest was shot by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree dead , exactly , as my cousin used to say , like an apple falling . Around the mother of another family friend , an old woman stricken in bed with some illness , a group of soldiers , white and black , danced , pricking her now and then with a bayonet Point . These few details serve well enough , except to add that whatever frailty words may have , those naked chimneys , at least , the heel prints on the doors , the slashed tail surprised me . General Sherman himself , with perfect dignity , mentions that Grant was twenty-one days in bed with the leg , and I knew that almost any other biographer of Grant would tell you that he was on three sprees during that New Orleans visit , and that General Franklin told Samuel Clemens that with his own eyes he had seen the general fall off his horse drunk . And Grant 's harsh story of driving out the Jews from the contraband trade at Memphis puzzled me , knowing how his brother-in-law had been one of the worst at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grant to pack him off . From General Sher-man 's memoirs my chief surprise was quite otherwise . What surprised me was the even , discreet , almost colorless tone of the writing . If he had not included some of his own letters and reports I might have missed him entirely , save for actions and reactions here and there that were indicative . How then this grave style and steady past propriety in the memoirs of generals ? I asked myself that , and was relieved at last to think of Caesar . It was the military tradition in letters . Quintilian , Catullus , half the antique world , crackled with Caesar 's indiscretions . With what simple construction his sentences march through his account of himself and through the ranks of burnt-out tribesmen and their boiling wives ! At length I seemed to understand . I could return to my mutton . If so far all this seems trivial , there are , nevertheless , two points to be said of it . In the first place it is no further from Mr. Lewis ' book than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second place it is one way of expressing the power and persuasion and the strange poetry of a unique figure in our history . It is as if , in some childhood landscape of the mind , through the bloody trees and the fatalistic light of some finality , I saw emerge this slim , tall figure , red-haired , too red-haired for patience as he said , honorable , impetuous and rich in nature , devoted , hot and humble , grim , charming . He is sometimes half-mad with his own sincerity , intensity and concentration in the midst of a resentful and red-tape governmental world or a silly newspaper world , or the dull envy of the military . He is a wit by desperation and high spirits , a rushing tongue and a free temper , a fire-eater because of dreams reversed , a kind man and a good friend , a talker , a swearer and a restless solitary . This is not to speak of his youthful taste for Southern living , his desire to be a painter , nor of that cynicism , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perhaps not even now would know . It derived , like all significant cynicism , from a combined sincerity and intensity of character and feeling . Its occasion arose when confronted with officialdom , or the spouting easy sham of the world of men , or the glib tinsel of celebrating , greedy mediocrity . Mr. Lewis ' biography , like all biographies in our modern line , has had the usual access to unusual sources . The earlier frontier pages , with Sherman 's father and foster father , Thomas Ewing , later in the Cabinet , are vivid and easy as opera ? peace to those hearty bones resting at last in pioneer graves ! We come then to the better chapters on Tecumseh 's early days , then West Point , then the roaming . We get a sense of the youth so intense , so loyal , so strangely pure in natural impulse . Mr. Lewis creates very well for us this youth not naturally philosophic or too long reflective , the desires lively and simple , the motion outward most ardent , the passions half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the dancing , the friends there , the painting , the taste for luxury and beauty , then the California venture , the marriage to Ellen Ewing after a long engagement , her Catholicism , which he could never accept save as a part of her energy and stress . We see his cleanness , the characteristic actions so erratic , high-toned and uncertain , the personal appeal disarming and lovable . These are the best parts of the biography . The part that concerns the War between the States is rejoiced with many of Sherman 's own words , letters , reports and remarks , which the author repeats , and with pictures of certain unforgettable moments . Though it professes to be a portrait of Sherman , not military history , the book at this point can not escape the latter burden also . As such it is a sort of warm and vivid and staccato tosh . The immense emotional force of Sherman comes through at times , and a kind of soprano view of his genius and military strategy . Meanwhile , nevertheless , hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are kept alive for us . We see his attitude toward Lincoln , getting better as Lincoln himself grew in quality ; his desire for decency in the army and its raids ; his summary moments ; his generous love and recognition of Grant , whose brains he rated less than his own but whose tenacity he set above all men 's ; his gradual development toward a more ruthless method in war ; his submission to what he would not at first have tolerated : the frenzy , debauchery and half-chaos of his Georgia army , with the wagons hiding mulatto women who shared the camp feasts , the smashing , drinking and hilarious waste , which Sherman more or less overlooked because he saw the march to the sea , with all that it comprised , as his first and last means to peace , because also his own temper felt more or less the exasperation of the campaigns , and because he loved and humored his men ? never in fact during the war could Sherman bring his men to the shambles as Grant and others might see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting between Sherman and Johnston , and of the public attacks on Sherman and the treachery at Washington , are admirable . The picture of Sherman 's worn marchers , when the federal troops were brought back from the war to pass in review before the President , is stirring and beautiful . Sherman 's contempt for the politicians , for the Negro troops , the thought of whom appalled and disgusted him , and for the Abolitionists , is well presented . There are moments when this biography , taken as mere history , is only a sort of flaccid sparkle . For example , General Forrest , the Confederate cavalry leader . He gets a snappy paragraph , and a few lines here and there : an aggressive genius , Sherman called him a devil , he even peppered his men once in their posteriors when their ad vance failed to suit him . It was this delicious creature , however , that Lee pronounced the greatest soldier under his command . There are six biographies of Forrest , scores of accounts of his tactics and engagements , several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated that but for Bragg 's jealousy and President Davis ' interference , Forrest might have greatly altered Sherman 's march to the sea . How and why ? As history it is also absurd to see an event passed up in this sentence about Jefferson Davis ' " On May ro Davis was captured while fleeing through the dawn dressed in his wife 's raincoat and shawl . " This is all the author has to say about it . We have only to observe that , first , Lincoln had planned that Davis be merely allowed to escape ; second , what difference does the disguise make , if you want a disguise ? third , Davis was not " fleeing through the dawn " ; he and Mrs. Davis were awakened in their camp by a Negro who had come to warn them of horsemen approaching . In the dark Davis caught tip an ulster there that happened to be Mrs. Davis ' instead of his own , and as he went out to meet the men she followed him to put a shawl over his head against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tale was brought out of Mrs. Davis ' trunk by a trooper , who in forcing the lock had his hand shot off by his carbine . Barnum , knowing What 's what , gave Broadway a scene in the wax works , and history prospered . Alas , all his life Barnum was writing more of our history than he knew ! The account of Sherman 's life after the surrender and on to his death is the poorest part of the book . The shame and scorn for the course of events , the restlessness , the refusals to be put up for President , the move to Washington , the life in New York , of that most Uncle Billy Period , are such as do not lend themselves so well to the author 's method or the tone of his style . Being kissed by Young ladies , kissed by the actresses , seen at every first night , making innumerable speeches at dinners and banquets , these were facts enough ; but many things otherwise arose , difficult to reveal or bring alive in a vivacious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leaving out the personal experiences , griefs and satisfactions , I will cite one instance as an illustration of how the historical superficiality makes the record here of Sherman superficial . It is where Mr. Lewis comes to the Hayes-Tilden election . He says , " Not until March , 1877 , was the question finally decided by a commission in favor of Hayes . " That is about all , and the point of it is merely the picture of Sherman in Washington , pacing up and down , cursing and lamenting the fate of the nation and the army should the Democrats assume control . But this is one of the most important and crucial moments in American politics . It is simple history  - -  Rhodes , for example , will do , not only an authority but a Republican as well ? that when the returns from the 1876 election came in , the Republican party found itself three states short of staying in power . Florida , South Carolina and Louisiana had to be managed . There is no space here except to say that Grant 's sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight thousand ahead of Hayes , the delegation of statesmen sent to control the eballoting , the tabulation ( behind closed doors to which no Democrat was admitted ) by clerks five of whom were Condemned criminals , some for murder , the happy returns , and the scandal of the thing , brought on a revulsion in the better Northern sentiment strong enough to alter the c ? 11Tsso of Reconstruction policy . Nothing in this history could have been turned into a fuller revelation of Sherman . ' a Passion for the Union , his relations with Grant , his reaction to politics , to decency , his mentality , impulsiveness , affections ( his brother John was one of the prime agents sent to New Orleans ) , these and nearly all the rest of him s , are implicit in this crisis , and might well be used in any study of Sherman that wants to find his center . In the P eta biography that crisis is only a tableau . The greatness and vividness of Sherman in his best years , notwithstanding , do emerge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The book does not , in fact , take away very much from Sherman 's greatness , but it takes a good deal from ours .
