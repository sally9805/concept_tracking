Canada 's Conservative Richard Bedford Bennett is now the dignified , correct and unpopular leader of His Majesty 's Loyal Opposition . Last week in Ottawa , this onetime premier rose before the Budget Committee in the House of Commons to denounce the duty-free entrance of U. S. publications and syndicate features into Canada , to flay some of the Dominion 's most vulgar and popular U. S. comic-strip importations . <P> Turning to the hectic married life of George McManus ' Jiggs &; Maggie , Bachelor Bennett declared : " They represent marriage as a series of squabbles and deceits . I do not think even the most hardened member of this committee would regard the Jiggses as being the very best literature for Sunday morning . " <P> Next Mr. Bennett considered the doings of Frank Willard 's banjo-eyed , derby-hatted Moon Mullins and his friends Kayo , Emmy and Lord Plushbottom . " When you get down to the others , " Mr. Bennett grumbled , " I do not know whether Moon Mullins adds greatly to the store of knowledge of young and growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> Committeeman Walter D. Euler thereupon interjected : " You are pretty familiar with Moon Mullins . " <P> Gravely Mr. Bennett replied , " I am . Fortunately I have reached the age where it is not likely to be injurious to me. "
