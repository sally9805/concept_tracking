0 FTEN I am. told that I might have been  --  that I still might be  --  professional heavyweight champion of the world . Instead , I held the heavyweight title in the comparative obscurity of the amateur class . But I feel my nonprofessional honors have been as thoroughly earned as any professional title . I have defended my class , or offered to defend it , against professional as well as amateur champions in almost every country in the world . I have finished on my feet every fight I ever started , though Jack Dempsey could have knocked me out in our first bout , had he so willed . But I was a kid then , a novice just starting . The major ring honors I have won suecessi rely are : Middleweight. championship * of the Allied armies in the Inter-Allied Games in Paris ; heavyweight championship of the United States under the auspices of the Amateur Athletic Union ; world light-heavyweight championship in the Olympic Games ; and amateur heavyweight championship of England .

Visions of the professional heavyweight belt occasionally still plague me , but I 'm sure I 've won my final . battle against the temptation to turn pro . Frequently it has tested my will power to the utmost to turn my back on the rich rewards of professionalism , particularly when I 've been in desperate need of cash . With pockets empty , many times I 've waved aside proffered fat purses . I 've said , " No , thanks , " to invitations to fight under the auspices of both the late Tex Rickard and London 's prominent fight promoter , the late Peggy Bettison . Had it not been for the earnest advice of my old and intimate friend , Gene Tunney , I might have yielded a few years ago . Gene pleaded with me to remain an amateur when my inclination was to go over the fence .

Down went the foreman again . The wind was gone from him . But he got to his feet at last , panting , " Quits ! I 'm licked ! " Abe walked away without another word . To say that I was thrilled by that fight would be putting it mildly . In Abe I had seen grace , rhythm , science , music in action . I ran after him to ask how it was done . " G it me a basin of hot water with some salt in it , " Abe ordered . " What a fool I was , " he muttered , " giving that big bully a thousand-dollar licking for nothing !

They had fallen in love and married while my father was working as an engineer in Colorado . A few years after father died , mother moved with her brood to Longmont , iii Northern Colorado . She had had a good education . Her outstanding talent was as a linguist . She speaks fivelanguages fluen tly . Until the older boys could help her , mother supported us by teaching German and French , doing needlework and even by taking i n washing . My early recollections are of selling newspapers . running errands , doing any sort of work that would add to the family income . Life was a fight for bread . I do n't recall any boyhood scraps of moment .. My memories are of friendships rather than fights . Certainly nothing in my childhood turned my amilitions toward the prize ring .

I felt that . if I wanted to follow in their footsteps I , too , must become a member of the bar . I was encouraged in my determination to become a lawyer by my mother . Yet she gave me to understand that I must fight for the necessary education myself . I knew she would willingly sacrifice my share of her support , and the rest was up to me . In the Footsteps of the Merritvells OUTSIDE of schoolbooks I had another book k .. / hero . It was he who shaped my ambitions for clean living and athletic supremacy . Frank Merriwell was my idol 's name . I 'm sure I 'm not the only one who has found boyhood inspiration in the paperbound volumes of Gilbert Patten , alias Burt L. Standish . Frank Merriwell 's superhuman virtues were to me precepts far more impressive than the Ten Commandments . To this day I have never used tobacco , because Frank did n't . My first glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taken under social compulsionone of the ranch hands . No one knew Abe well because lie seldom did much talking . It was said he fought professionally on occasion , but I most admired his ability with the lasso . He was a ropin ' fool . The foreman stood six-feet-something in his boots . His 200 pounds were chiefly sinew . He could throw a steer in three minutes . Abe was a modest five-feet-five in height and tipped the ranch scales at 115 pounds . The fight I saw reminded me of the story of David and Goliath . I do n't know what started i t . The foreman said something to Abe that the cowboy did n't like . All I recall is Abe 's brown bare arm suddenly lashing out with the speed and accuracy of a rattlesnake striking . Crack ! Square on the Irishman 's jaw his knuckles connected . The big fellow toppled like a mighty oak . The . ground trembled as he struck . With a roar of rage he regained his feet . For several seconds Abe hit him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then like a cyclone the foreman charged T GOT the salt and hot water and soon was helping 1 my new hero nurse his broken knuckles . Thus I got my first lesson in mending broken mitts , information I later handed on to Gene Tunney in France when he had broken his knuckles in the A. E. F. bouts . The foreman was a different man thereafter . Abe , to my joy , stayed on . I became his shadow when my duties allowed . He was amused by my eager demands that he teach me something of boring . For days he discouraged me with the smiling statement that it was a mug 's game . I refused to be squelched , and finally persistence won . " All right , " he at length agreed . " First , get a. good left-hand punch . When you get that down you 've got a good head start . over the other fellow . Then learn how to cross with your right , but use it only when you 've cleared the way with your left . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained . " We were the scouting force .

" When I advanced from oral instruction to practical demonstrations I was many times tempted to quit . We had no gloves . We boxed barehanded . Abe always kept his hands open , but after one of his slaps my cheeks would burn for hours . He branded his points in my memory with every slap . There is something humiliating about a slap . You remember it when a punch would be forgotten . Many times I decided the game was not worth the candle . Nursing my smarting cheeks , I told myself I would not bother Abe further . But next day I was back for more . For two years , on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the basic points of boxing , feinting , blocking , countering and footwork . Also he instilled in my mind a little of ring strategy . One lesson was soon to help me to my first ring victory . One year after Abe 's pony took him down the southern trail toward Mexico and out of my life , I entered Longmont High School . I had secured a job as janitor of the Mountain States Telephone Building , to enable me to contribute to the family support . Every morning I arose at 5:30 , fired the big furnace and then swept out the entire two-story building . After school I dumped ashes , cleaned up the cellar , banked the furnace for the night , and then was free to devote myself to home studies . Sundays I sold newspapers . When I first started wielding the broom I followed the system of my predecessor , which was to sweep with vim and vigor ; ! Ind lei ttur-chist-e-luchls drift where they mitt . The telephone operators invably broke forth in a chorus of coughing that must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from lung sanatoriums . Earnestly I put my mind to that . problem . I perfected a mixture of sawdust and kerosene , which , sprinkled lightly over the floors before sweeping , effectively laid the dust . When the district malinger heard of the interest I took in my job he raised my pay a dollar a month . But I needed more money if I was to finish high school . Two of my brothers were in college , and though they worked on the side , frequently we had to send money from home . One evening I read in the local newspaper of the death of the caretaker of the Congregational Church . I believed I could swing two janitorial jobs as well as one . It . was winter and fresh snow was deep . The next day I kept my eye peeled for Doctor Markley , the pastor of the church , passing on the street . When I saw him I offered condolences for the loss of his worker and volunteered to clear the church sidewalk so that . the funeral might move expeditiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my offer . Never have I cleared snow from a sidewalk better . After the funeral Doctor Alarkley asked me to continue as janitor . " You take care of the church , Eddie , " he said , " and I 'll take care of the souls . " The pay for my new job doubled my earnings to twenty-four dollars a. month , but the additional work also imposed a sacrifice . I had no time for school athletics . Temporarily I could not follow in Frank Merriwell 's glorious footpath . But I ca n't say that I lacked for exercise . When not in class or engaged in home studies , I was building muscle with coal shovels , snow shovels , brooms , washing dishes after church suppers , waxing floors , dusting pews , wrestling ash barrels . But there was one sport I could n't give up  --  no matter what  --  boxing . I had no gloves and , more important , no opponent . So I shadow boxed . Now , shadow boxing is one of the best . forms of fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can block imaginary blows , then sail in with countering lefts and rights , sidestep , weave , bob , feint. , uppercut and jab . It does n't require a large gymnasium or equipment . of any kind . The Terrible Fight in the Basement l DID my shadow boxing when I banked the fur- nace in the telephone building . One night about 9:30 I was cutting an imaginary Jack Johnson to ribbons , using my own enlarged shadow cast by a street lamp as . the champion , when suddenly I saw a 1-pull's-eye lantern flash at the back door . A muffled noise sounded . My hair stood on end . It was too late for the visitor to be any of our linemen . There was money in the safe upstairs . I slipped into the shadows . I phoned upstairs to the night operators to listen . If I did not report back to them in two The Congregational Churc minutes they were to call the police , I advised them huskily . Then , all goose flesh , I crept toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the crack . In walked the town constable . " Hello , Eddie , " he said anxiously . " What 's the row down here ? Mrs. Bishop came chasing me a few minutes ago to report a terrible fight going on in the basement . She said she looked in the windows and saw some big brute murdering someone . " I laughed in sheer relief and called to the nervous operators that all was well . Then I explained what I had been doing , and even demonstrated with a few passes and side steps . " Well , Eddie , " said the constable , " I guess that 's good exercise and you sure know how 1 o do it. ; but if Eagan While Playground Supervisor at Washing-ton School , Denver , With a Crowd of Campfire Girls on an Outing I was you , after this I 'd pull down the blinds first . People passing , like Mrs. Bishop , are apt. to think there 's a real fight on , or " ? he paused ? " that . somebody 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last .. I continued fighting my phantom opponents , though thereafter I did it with drawn shades . Despite my work outside , I managed to maintain good averages in school . More than that , I took especial interest in debating , though every debate meant extra research and study . I became a member of the school debating team . One year we wou every debate with outside schools . I felt sure that the career of a Webster or a Clay was opening before me . And then I found a sparring partner  --  a real live one . Newcomers to Longmont. were the Rice family , who had moved in from Iowa . Earl , a son , was of my own age , physique and general interests . Immediately we struck up a firm friendship . Earl Rice wanted to he an all-around athlete . Toward that end he subscribed for every magazine published which advised its readers how to become perfect physical specimens . I well remember his rushing naked from his house into the snow to harden his muscles , as some writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of training , and another peculiarity of his health-building course filled me with resentment . It was an item of diet .. Never have I been able to eat an onion . Yet a. health adviser in one of Earl 's magazines stated unequivocally that only a. frequent and fulsome repast . of onions could supply the constitution with the raw strength and muscle-building qualities that were the marks of supermen. .11 Gymnasium in a Deserted Village VARL was my superior on a trapeze bar and J I in weight lifting , beyond question . I therefore assumed he was my better in all forms of athletics . And I gave credit for his assumed superiority to the vitality contained in onions . It did n't seem fair I should start life with such a handicap as an unconquerable aversion to omnipotent onions ! Among Earl 's strength-building equipment . were boxing gloves . I never had been able to afford a. pair . I loved those gloves . That WaS the only sport I cared for . But after a. few bouts in Earl 's home , his mother invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on account of the icy ground I could get in none of my footwork . We decided to find a gymnasium . North Longmont was then one of Colorado 's ghost towns . Through the snow we hiked there to select a gymnasium from among the deserted beildings . Our choice was a , former saloon . By moving the bar we were able to clear space for a ring . In the rear we suspended a bucket pinched full of holes with a nail , which served as our shower . Every minute I could spare from school and work was spent there with Earl . Gosh , how I enjoyed those mix-ups ! We both profited by constant practice . And then one day the eyes of my sparring partner and myself were fascinated by a placard in a butcher-shop window . It announced a boxing smoker at the lodge rooms of the local Elks . Two fighters from Denver were to be the main attraction . " Gee , " Earl breathed , " but I 'd like to see that bout ! " I was seized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said excitedly . " Let 's offer to box a preliminary so we can get in to see the whole show . " Earl 's eager eyes met. mine in enthusiastic agreement . Together we burst I o the butcher shop . We could hardly wait until George Noble had finished wrapping a steak for the customer he was attending heft ire we blurted out our proposition . Mr. Noble , we knew , was chairman of the entertainment committee . We held our breaths while we arvaited his decision . I. Yeah , " he pronounced slowly , " that ought to be ; III right . " ' Then'Iii asked a question . " Which one of you is the best tighte ? ? " Up to that second Earl Rine and I were pals to the death . When that momentous question was propounded , a. wall t he skies Sill ldenly rose between us . I regarded Earl to hear him say t hat I Was . he was looking at me with a nasty . squint to hear the same ? ? rords from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . belief , " Mr. Noble , we do n't know , but we 'll put up a. good scrap or you do n't have to let us see the main beta . " Happy though we were at . the success of our proposal . the two boys who had entered that taitcher shop as undying friends left it as co ' ' plete strangers . We regarded each other darkly . Our only exchange of words was a grunt of farewell after we had walked a few block- . I could hardly eon trol my impatience until the big night arrived . I still recall refusing a piece of pie at dinner , to the worried amazement of my mother . Wrapping my trunks , a roll of bicycle tape , sponge and sneakers in a towel , I walked to the lodge rooms alone . Looking up at the shining ' stars and breathing deeply , I begged the invisible spirit above for strength and victory . If only I could eat . onions too . Earl was there first . Our stiffness and formality toward each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To be an Elk was in those days the epitome of social distinction . Our discovery by Mr. Noble relieved the tension of feeling out of plaeo . He put us in the cloakroom to dress , as the only dressing room was occupied by the big shots from Denver . Winning a Fight by a Smile Soon we were in the ring and being introduced . Both of us suffered from stage fright . It was ' our first experience looking out on a crowd of fight fans from under the glare of ring lights . I 'm sure there NV ervni t more than two hundred faces around us. but I 've never been so overwhelmed ? y the sense of a vast , crowd . llere and there I recognized faces , men whose names were daily in the newspaper . The leading hanker of Longmont puffed away at . his perfecto . I thrilled at my nearness to greatness . The air was clouded with tobacco smoke , I saw the green walls through its haze . Then the gong rang . We rushed at each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I was out to finish Earl and he was determined to do the same thing to me . All through the first two rounds we slugged away at each other . Each time I landed and saw Earl shake off the blow , my heart sank . It was his darn onion diet that gave him his superstamina . If only I could eat them ! At the end of the second round I was all in . My lungs were tortured by the ( Conttnuod from Page 5 ) stale tobacco smoke . I was gasping for air . My i arms and legs ached in weariness. it did n't seem possible I could get up for this third round . It . was then that my memory flashed a lesson from the ring strategy of Abe Tobin . " If you feel tired in a fight , " he had told me , " v.lways remember that the other fellow is just , as tired as you are . Smile at . him and he 'll think you 're still fresh and st rang . " 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It . wits a lying smile , a hypocritical smile , if you will . But it did the trick . It overwhelmed the advantage his onion diet . When the gong sounded I sailed ill , still smihng . Earl gave ground . I planted punches all over hitt I , though none had strength behind them . At the end of the round I was award , the decision . It was my first ring victory . Rewards of Victor and Vanquished I believe that night 's events clinched my determination to make fighting my life 's avocation . Elks slapped me on the back in congratulation , and tendered me gruff compliments . 1 had a ringside seat at the main event . I gorged myself on sandwiches , doughnuts and coffee . Earl had as good a time as did I. He accepted his defeat philosophically and the old cordiality between u.s was reestablished . The issue of who was the better man with the gloves had been settled for all time  --  his onion diet notwithstanding . We walked home together , anti in our mutual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in me a formal confirmation of Abe Tobin . ' s remembered lesson . " Gosh , Eddie , " he said , " you 're better than 1 thought . I was so darn . weak ? hom you smiled at me before the third round ! That 's what took the fight out of me . " When summer came , there were no furnaces to tend or snow to shovel , and church activities waned . It was natural dial salaries were reduced , and I hunted full-time employment at . such manual jobs as the region offered .. I variously herded cattle , pitchforked hay , or Worked in a factory . The last I I iked least , but I took whatever jot ) was at hand . I felt my muscles grow and harden . That was as important to me as I Ize pay envelopes I turned over to mother . One liummer while I was working in a loyal factory I encountered a bully worthy of Frank Me  --  riwell 's strong right , arm . It was the foreman of the . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position . That was one of his main qualifications for the job , because his underling 's were the floating laborers who followed seasonal occupations in the West , a tough lot .. Tales were told of how he had ' broken some worker 's jaw with one blow because of some remark that he resented . I sari ' the foreman . often as I worked on my machine , but as I always was a steaxly worker , we had no occasion to clash for several weeks . So expert did I become at my particular job that frequently my work was ahead of the man I was working with . At such time I filled in my spare moments in shadow boxing . Several times the forem an saw me engaged in that exercise and always rewarded my efforts with a sneer . That irritated m.e and I studied his big figure , speculating on how I would fight him if ever he laid hand upon me . I recall that his shoulders were tremendous . One day he sent for me , shortly after he had witnessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him he was berating a stooping and inoffensive worker . " You get th ' hell out o ' here , " he ? vas saying . " This ai n't no cripples ' convention . You had that hernia afore you ever lifted any o ' our tubs . " The man started to protest that he had not had a hernia before . There were no workmen's-compensation laWs in those days . He was wording his protest earnestly and civilly when the foreman seized him by the shoulders and sent him reeling out . of the yard . Then he turned to me . He surveyed me insolently and spat tobacco juice at my feet .. " You 're th ' kid that has so much time to loaf that , you 're always swinging your fists in the air , " he sneered . " I 'll keep you busy . From now on you clean scraps and tend the feeder . " I had been tempted to intervene in behalf of the discharged worker when the foreman had laid violent hands on him . Now my dislike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt , to penalize me for my expertness , which gave me occasional moments of leisure . The new job I had been ordered to take was the most arduous in the factory . It meant . carrying heavy receptacles to the top of a fifteen-foot ladder . Scoring My First Knockdown The lately discharged workunan easily could have developed a hernia from that task . In those days every worker toiled from ten to sixteen hours . I did n't , want the job ; for one reason , because it might . make me muscle-bound , which is a hopeless handicap for a fighter . " I 'll stick to my present job , " I answered , looking the foreman squarely in the eyes . Amazed indignation and rage flushed his features . To be crossed by two employes within a few minutes was too much . " You 're fired ! " he yelled . " Git out o ' here ! " He moved towards me threateningly , as he had towards the other worker . " I 'll go , but . first I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing firm . " You 'll git it on pay day and not a minute sooner ! " he roared . " Gil ! " I knew my rights . I was entitled to my pay check at once . " I wo n't ' git ' without my check , " I insisted . It might have been my mimicking his pronunciation of " git " that was the Basil straw . At any rate , the foreman drew back his hand and slapped me violently . I have commented before on the 1l um ilizetion of a slap . I saw red . I shot a straight left to his jaw . Down he went . It was the biggest surprise of my life . Never before had a blow of mine knocked anyone over . I stood gaping . Then a thrill went through me . Whitt a punch I had ! I heard cheers . Near-by workers had been watching , and even had the foreman been of a different type , they probably would have cheered just the same . Few bosses of floating labor are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting stance . And then my 122 arms were pinioned from behind . It was the foreman 's assistant . I tried to tear myself free as the foreman advanced on me . His face was contorted in rage , and he surely would have struck me had it not been for the workmen who came crowding about .. The foreman must have noted the looks in their angry , glittering eyes . " Let him go , " he muttered to my captor . " Have ' em fix his pay check up in the afiee . " He turned away . The incident ended with that statement . I got . my pay check , but the feeling of supreme self-confidence instilled by my physical victory was a far richer reward than the money . I soon found another job , but I could not escape from the ballyhoo of my encounter . When a boss has been licked by a worker , the news travels quickly . M3r youthfulness and smaller size added picturesque details to the discussion of the fight , if it could be called that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers in Longmont 's rival seasonal industry  --  the sugar-beet factory . Feeling ran high between the groups of workers . I was pictured as the champion of my factory , even though I no longer worked there . The sugar factory brought . forth its best man to challenge me for the town 's industrial championship . Of course I accepted . The fight was held in the Longmont Armory . The spectators were almost entirely workers in the rival factories  --  few of them Longmont residents . There was little interest in the personalities of the contenders . The fans were pro one factory or pro the other . My opponent was known as Kid West . He was entirely a self-proclaimed champ . He had taken the title out of the air and intimidated any who might dispute his right by offering to stake a huge purse on the outcome . A man who had that much self-confidence in his prowess discouraged all aspirants . I wonder what would have happened had someone told him to put up his purse . In the Ring With Kid West We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had reported that rny opponent , whom I had never seen , was a powerful heavyweight , though slow . Earl Rice had volunteered to be my second , but three friends from my factory also insisted on being in my corner . If the number of my seconds was any assurance of victory , I could not lose . My mind was somewhat trouI pled as I noted growing jealousy among them . I was changing into my fighting togs in the dressing room when yet another would-be second burst in to volunteer his services . " Eddie , there 's a million people out . there . Reeder , the sugar-factory boss , just bet your friend Jack Kitely ten bucks that Kid West would knock you out . Ai n't you scared ? " That was hardly a proper cheerio from a friend , but I managed to maintain my poise . " We 'll see about knock-outs , " I replied with a confidence I was far from feeling . " Get me my bandages and tape . " I wrapped the cotton gauze around once and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant . one of my seconds returned from a scouting expedition in Kid West 's dressing room . " Gee , Eddie , " he reported . " Put on more of that tape ; vulcanize your fists with it . You oughter see what Kid Test 's puttin ' on . His fists look like two big black rocks . " EVENING POST I put on more tape , carefully binding the knuckles . Then I solidified my wrappings by beating a tattoo on the wall . The announcer burst into the room . " Hurry up , Eddie ! " he shouted . " Kid West is in the ring . " I started to follow , nervous and excited . " Just a minute , Eddie , " spoke up an old fight fan , who had joined my growing squad of seconds . " Take your time . Let him wait .. It makes a guy nervous to have a lot o ' people starin ' at him for five minutes . He ai n't no million-dollar diamond without feelings . Half that crowd are fer you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hating . He might come to believe ' em . " I recognized good advice . Leisurely I sat . down . I felt comforted . Ten more minutes I stalled , impervious to the howls of fans outside . My nervousness left me . When I climbed into the ring I was calm , collected , confident . The Bigger They fire I took my first look at Kid West . His size almost overwhelmed me . He was a giant and all muscle . Earl Rice must have . noted my reactions . " The bigger they are , the harder they fall , " he quoted from the Boxers ' Bible . " When you lean on that mountain 's jaw like you did your foreman 's he 'll think an earthquake shook him . " Years later I was to remember that remark when I faced Brancourt , the Australian champion , who towered a foot above me and outweighed me by eighty-live pounds . The sugar-factory fans jeered at my tardiness and youth . " Sueh a sweet little boy ! Was he takin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West rock him to sleep with a sugared right ! " When I stood with Kid West in the center of the ring I noted sudden activity among the fans . The difference in our size impressed them in West 's favor . Kid West money was being offered everywhere . My backers were getting bigger and bigger odds . Workers from my factory who had banked on me to win became dubious . Why does mere size count for so much with fans ? It never should . But I was conscious of the sudden shift of moneyed opinion to Kid West 's corner . It made me panicky . I forced myself back to confidence by recalling how I had laid the foreman low with one wallop . The gong sounded . Kid West . clumsily moved towards the center of the ring , affecting a flat-footed stance such as one sees in the old lithographs of bare-knuckled professionals . That cheered me . I decided my first efforts should be towards tiring him out .. Advancing cautiously , I pranced about his hulking figure , jabbing whenever I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I noticed , after a minute or two , that he was breathing hard , despite the fact neither of us had received a real blow . His muscles bulged and under his hairy skin they looked like wound-up clock springs . " Forget th ' fancy dancing an ' let 's see some fightin ' ! " cried a fan . Others took up his call . They had all paid a quarter for admission and felt they were being cheated . I feinted with my left . West swung his right . ponderously . It came like a ranch gate on rusty hinges . Leisurely I side-stepped . West lost his balance as the blow wasted itself on the smoke-filled air . I danced in and peppered him about the eyes . I exulted as I saw a March 5,1932 mouse take shape . If that sounds savage , I can only say that there can be no mercy in a fight like that one . Cheers came to my ears  --  cheers for me . They distracted me for a second . West rushed me and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bulk and strength were overwhelming . I felt something snap in my back as he threw me to the canvas . As I got to my feet he charged with arms flailing like a threshing machine . My spine had a twitching pain that seemed to paralyze me for long-range punching . However , as we closed , with my free arm I managed to shoot some stiff jabs to his stomach . He grunted and broke the arm scissors hold with which be held me . The bell rang . My backbone felt like a wash rag and I was weak as a kitten as I walked to my corner . Four seconds fought to succor me , fanning the air , massaging , and giving me a. sponge bath . I suffered their well-meaning but painful ministrations because my spine throbbed with a greater pain . Nevertheless , I preferred my opponent to the mauling and manhandling of my seconds . At . the tap of the gong I leaped forward . I realized that another wrestling match might finish me . I had to get in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran up and down my spine . As West moved forward I rested my chin on my chest and smacked in four uppercuts , left , right , left , right , square on his solar plexus . With a bellowing grunt he went . down . At the count of eight he was up , though breathing heavily . Although he . coul.d shovel coal twelve hours a day without exhaustion , he now was spent . For the unskilled and muscle-bound , boxing is the most fatiguing exercise in the world . Champion of Longmont The bleachers were in pandemonium after West was floored . Above the cheers , hoots , eat-calls , that echoed deafeningly from the ringside , one voice penetrated with advice for my opponent , . " Heave your right at him , West ! " it cried . Foolishly he heeded . It was my chance . As he lunged towards me with a wide-swinging right , I closed in . His arm wrapped itself harmlessly around my neck and Kid West rocked under the full force of a right uppercut to the stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He tried to say something , but . could n't . He tried to rise , but could n't . He just sat there with his mouth open and a stupid , pained expression on his face . When ten had been counted , I helped him to his corner . And then what a thrill ! ' I Eddie Eagan winner by a knockout ! " bawled the referee as he held up my hand . Thereafter my memory is a blur , except I know I enjoyed the sensation . The bleachers were in an uproar . The Armory roof seemed to lift , under the volume of cheers . As my quartet of seconds , who surely would have defeated me had I been obliged to endure their handling a second time , bundled me towards the dressing room , there were back slaps , handshakes , cries of congratulation . I was town champion ! That sort of thing ca n't be bought with money . The thrills and throbs of the ring are its true lure , if you enjoy them as I do . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that evening 's triumph . My victory was enough . It always has been . " You seem to enjoy fighting , " said the doctor in the dressing room as he probed my aching vertebrae for a possible fracture . " If I were you I 'd avoid heavyweight wrestlers hereafter . You have only one backbone to break . " I shall not dwell on the rewards of my fame after that victory . They were purely honorary . None offered to taint me with money . Suffice to say that my local reputation was so enhanced that I was encouraged to enter the Denver Athletic Club bouts during the Christmas vacation . Longmont was proud of its pugilistically talented son . The D. A. C. bouts were held concurrently with the livestock show in Denver . Stockmen came to town with prize steers , hoping for blue ribbons ; we amateurs came with high hopes of a championship , the emblem of which was a gold watch . Many ocean crossings and my world tour never gave me the thrill of that first railroad journey on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour . With me was my faithful friend , Earl Rice . He was to be my second . Earl was a veteran traveler because he had already ridden by train from Iowa to Longmont . But he did not impress his superiority on me . I was a man seeing the world alone . I sat . in the day-coach smoker with the men . I bought peanuts and candy from the train boy . In short , I had a glorious time , for my self-confidence was at its peak in the business that carried me to distant Denver . It never entered my head that I would not win the championship . Boxers came from six Western states to compete in the D. A. C. bouts . Each wore the colors of some local gymnasium or tight club . It had been arranged that I was to wear the colors of a Denver gym , the Jacobs Club , so named after its proprietor . The tournament extended over a week . In the Jacobs Club was Lum My-berg , a gold miner from Cripple Creek , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had to dry out to make 145 pounds . I weighed 138 pounds . I was not regarded as real stuff by either Jacobs or Myberg . However , it was thought that I might polish off one or two of the lesser lights in order to clear the decks for the champion . I was only slightly nervous as I met my first cosmopolitan crowd of fight fans . Right Advice for the Wrong Eddie My first match was against a Swede named Lewis . He was a boiler maker and reputed to have a terrific punch . When we N%rere called to the center of the ring , I noticed a perfect tangle of black hair on his chest . I thought of the Sunday-school story of Samson and I longed for a pair of shears . I pecked away with a straight left and then bicycled out of his reach . Lewis thought the fans in the gallery were throwing stones at him . I did not knock him out , but at the end of the three rounds , Damon Runyon , then on the Denver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a mother could love . " The judges gave me the decision . I had two other fights before reaching the semifinals . Neither is worth relating in detail , but an amusing incident oecured in connection with the semifinal . My opponent was a boy about my own age named Eddie Monahan , of the Lucky Buck Club . He was a flashy boxer , with a sharp , stinging right cross . Now , I had never really developed my right , except to protect my chin . In the third round a big rancher at the ringside yelled , " Eddie , cross your right ! " I thought he was advising me , and let my right go just as Monahan stepped in . Much to my surprise , he went down and out . As I crawled out of the ropes , I said to the rancher , " Thanks for your tip . " He growled good-naturedly , " I meant the other Eddie . That punch cost me three hundred bucks . " That victory put me in the final with Lum Myberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the referee , called us to the middle of the ring and told us to fight with one arm free and to let go when he said , " Break . " Before I turned to my corner , My-berg made a disturbing remark . " Mr. Referee , " said Myberg , " do I have to go to my corner when I knock him down , or can I stand over him ? " Near Defeat by Drowning Coming from a chap who , until that evening , had been most cordial to me , this proved disconcerting . I was not sure that I could lick Myberg , but I was going to try hard . I certainly did not contemplate being knocked down by him , so I felt greatly relieved when Eddie Day said , " Cut out the hot air , Lum . You 'll need all your wind for fighting . " And he did . We battled three rounds . And what a fight ! My six bouts in less than a week had put me in fine shape . Lum had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had won in the first round against mediocre opponents . From the tap of the gong we were at each other . I kept my left out and flickered his nose , than jabbed him in the eye . He was stronger than I , and when we tangled in the el in eh e s he would say , " Wo n't hit you hard im til the next . round . " Then he would let go a punch that would have paralyzed me , had it connected . Jacobs was in Myberg 's corner . They were old friends . It was plain to see that Jacobs vas keen to have My-berg win . Rumor had it that following this fight. , Myberg would turn professional ; in which case , Jacobs would become his manager . Earl Rice , as usual , was in my corner . He was more excited than I. If his earnest efforts to serve me had measured up to his good intentions , all would have been well . Instead he nen rly caused my defeat . Towards the close of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . his head completely . He was trying to tell me what . to do in the next round while he offered me a drink of water in the rest interval . So intent was he on his lecture that he failed to pay proper attention to the task in hand . I was gasping for breath when he tilted the bottom of the bottle towards the ceiling . I was unprepared . Water went down my windpipe , nearly choking me . It welled out my nose and ears . I was overcome by a fit of coughing . Dropping the bottle , Earl began furiously pounding me on the back . I barely recovered as the bell sounded . I was weary when I responded to the gong for the second round . But I had a new and valuable ally  --  the advice of that right cross to which Eddie Monahan 's backer had suddenly awakened me . That right fist felt continuously full of dynamite . I used it steadily . Each time it landed I heard Myberg gasp . I had the advantage in that second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period ! While he fanned me he hopped around , talking , advising , chiding , and then  --  splash ! ? he put one foot in the water bucket . That // would not have been so bad if he could have taken it . out . He could n't . His shoe was stuck fast .. He tried to shake his foot free . Water splashed all over the corner . The crowd was in an uproar . Charlie Chaplin never thought of a better bit of comedy business . I was laughing , too , when I should have been resting . I had to go to his rescue . I grasped the bucket while my second wrenched his foot free . And the rest interval was almost over . Across the ring I saw Nyberg and Jacobs enjoying my discomfiture . In the last seconds before the gong sounded , Earl apologized and cheered me . " You 're ahead , Eddie , " he whispered . " You 're great . AIyberg is as ripe for a k. - o. as Monahan was . You 're t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , round , Eddie . Co in and knock him out ; knock him cold ! " Those words were as inspiring as a sixty seconds ' rest . I sloughed off my weariness and sprang to my feet at the tap of I he gong . The referee made us shake hands before we started . There followed the toughest three minutes of fighting in my memory . Probably Earl had made me overanxious for a knockout . I fought wildly . That new right cross of mine clipped Myberg 's chin so resoundingly that his knees sagged . But he did no't go down . He backed away , letting me hit him twice on top of the head . I started a third , when  --  crack ! ? I thought a window weight had hit me on the jaw . The air about me seemed filled with the lights of many Christ mas trees . My head echoed with the roll of distant drums . I was in a haze . Instinct made me clutch for Myberg . For dear life I held that clinch while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me off , to deliver t he coup de grace . I stuck to him like fly paper . I stayed in close where it was safe and automatically kept punching . When the referee finally pulled us apart , seven of the ten weaving opponents I had seen in the mist had left the ring . Two of the remaining three were now merging into one . At last I made out Myberg 's face . When Offense is the Best Defense Once more I could hear the roar of the crowd . lt filled me with high hopes and determination for victory . My blood tingled in response to those cheers . No one yet had ever preached to me what is now a bromide of fighting tactics  --  that the best defense is an offense . It came to me as an inspiration in the deafening shouts of those fight fans . I took a deep breath Of the smoke-laden air and sailed in . Myberg met me in the middle of the ring . I speared him with a straight left and he went . off balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie swung in attempted retaliation were going wild . He was game . He took all that I had to offer and came back for more . Head lowered , shoulders hunched , jaws set and arms swinging , he rushed me into a corner . " I got you now , " he panted . But he had n't really . He was whipping back his terrible right as he wasted his breath on those words . It was a fatal mistake . The second that his warning took enabled me to sidestep and whip my own right in an uppercut .. It robbed him of wind . He sagged . His own right fell impotently on my shoulder . Then there came to my ears from the ringside one voice , above a roar like thunder : " Come on , you Eddie Eagan , " it said . " Fight , you Eddie Eagan ! Fight ! Fight ! Fight ! Fight ! " There was a hypnotic quality in the voice that overcame my weariness . I drew on whatever reserves of vitality I had left . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both gloves like trip-hammers against his body . Suddenly I realized I had fought . my way out . of the corner . I was again in the center of the ring . Out of my swimming consciousness I knew that could mean but one thing . The mighty Lum Myberg was breaking ground before me . The frenzied yells of the mob came to me . How I loved it . And then the bell clanged . I straightened and reached for Myberg 's hand . His gaze wavered as he tried to see what was offered him . His eyes were glazed and he weaved uncertainly on his feet .. I caught his gloved right hand and shook it , though I knew not the outcome . " Great . fight , Eddie , " he panted . " A good kid you are . A nice fight . " I helped him to his corner , then crossed the ring to my own . As I reached it , the announcer was in the center of the ring . He came over and lifted my hand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most precious memories of my life . Forgotten were the blinding , smarting sweat in my eyes , the stinging bruises on my lips , the throbbing temples , the fierce thirst and dull aches throughout my whole body . I was welterweight champion of the Denver Athletic Club ! Earl Rice shared my pride , standing by my side . We were just two country buys deliriously happy at the sudden fame that . had come to us . Earl had our bucket under his arm as we capered in joy . The contents swished over the ringside spectators . They yelled at us profanely , but we did n't care . Fresh fighters were climbing into the ring . Someone removed the sodden gloves from my hands . Earl helped me down . We started toward the dressing room . For the first time I looked at him directly . His eyes were dilated and swimming in tears . " What . are you crying about ? " I asked him . He swallowed three times , gulped , clutched my arm and managed to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not win that gold watch , emblematic of the D. A. C. welterweight championship , all by myself . I am under an everlasting debt of gratitude to two fight fans  --  Eddie Monahan 's counselor , and the unknown adviser whose voice urged me on at the crucial moment . of that final bout . The Part the Fans Play So here 's to you , Mr. Fight Fan ! I 've loved you and I 've hated you in all parts of the world . Most of you shout too much . Few of you know what you 're talking about . Almost none of you are fighters yourselves . You do n't know that lonely feeling which comes at times in the ring when you 're facing a ruthless opponent , charging at you like a tornado or an enraged beast . You 've never felt the stinging pain that shoots from the spot where a six-ounce glove , soggy with water and stained with the gore of battle , connects . You 've never seen a sudden , flaming Arizona sunset flash with a sock to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ceiling of the fight hall cracks wide open overhead , letting in the , inkyjblackness as a right-hand bill ' darkens your consciousness . You 've never heard the ringing sounds and thunder inside your head , as unnamed stars and comets stud your vision . So , mostly , I ignore you . I 've had to win my own fights . At Denver you helped me get a start in this game I love . I 've been heartened by your cheers , but I 've been inspired by your jeers and scorn as often . Here 's my hand , fans . With all your faults , you make the game worth while . Like conquering heroes , Earl Rice and I returned to Longmont . News of my victory had preceded us . Everywhere were back slaps , handshakes , congratulations , compliments . My head may have begun to swell a trifle . But with my return to school I was quickly shorn of any budding conceit . The head master , John Casey , sent for me . He was a handsome young Irishman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground be walked on . He did not refer to my championship . Looking the straight in the eye , he said : " Eddie , your studies have taken a bad slump in the last few months . What 's the trouble ? " Fighting for a Scholarship I knew what the trouble was . The cheers of fight fans still rang in my ears when I should have been listening to my teachers . I was dreaming of ring battles when I should have been absorbing the wars of Rome . But I was ashamed to admit it .. " I 've been working hard outside of school , " I hedged . I realized that was not the real truth . Actually since I became town champion I had been overwhelmed by volunteer assistants in my work . At the church a swarm of youngsters always awaited my arrival to do the dusting , sweeping and dishwashing . But while I merely had to oversee the work done by my army , I seldom enjoyed mental relaxation . Every one of my volunteer assistants had ambitions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done the worker had ten questions as to how to become a fighter . " Doing any more work than you did last year ? " asked the head master . I shook my head . " Well , Eddie , something 's wrong , and I think you know what it is , " he said . " In Latin , you 're failing , and you stare out the window while I 'm explaining geometry theorems . Now , there are five months left . before graduation . Denver University is giving a four-year scholarship to the graduating senior recommended by the faculty . Your studies so far this year have been unsatisfactory . But if you use the same persistence and concentration studying that you do in boxing , you have a good chance to win it . I would like to see you try . " When John Casey dismissed me I resolved to win that scholarship or have a brain hemorrhage trying . That night I walked to the race track where Earl and I did roadwork . A lone evening star was shining and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jagged peaks of the Continental Divide reached like gnarled fingers to the sky . In my disturbed mind these gigantic peaks were but molehills compared to the great mental mountains of Latin , geometry and physics I would have to climb before June if I were to win that scholarship . It was hard to keep my mind on my new . ambition . I hated being a bookworm and having to work while my classmates were playing . I had made a lot of good friends and it was a test of // character to leave their pleasant society after school for study . But . I forced myself to do it . And soon I found I never enjoyed my lessons so much as when I had done them well . The slighted or glanced-over lessons of the fall got my attention . Fighting rives one a swaggering , devil-may-care attitude towards life . Study tempers that attitude ; the vastness of knowledge and smallness of one 's mind make for humility . However , the same persistence and spirit used in fighting helps to knock cold even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examinations . They reminded me of an amateur tournament . The bouts with biology , history and geology were easy , but physics and Latin had me hanging on the ropes . At the finish I was not sure which of us had won . There was no blood or sweat in these struggles , but there were an aching head and strained eyes . No yelling fans or seconds were present to spur you on . You fought alone and in silence . The strain of Naiting for a classroom decision I found harder than a wait in the ring . I tried to relax , but for some reason felt sad and depressed . It was the final week at high school . I had many friends , and probably this was the last time we would be together . Earl Rice was joining the Navy . At last the head master summoned me to his office . With fear in my heart that Latin had left-hooked me to defeat , I went . " Eddie , " said John Casey , " you 've won the scholarship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congratulate you on the fine fight you made . It means a lot to have a university education . In the long run , you 'll get as much pleasure battling books as ever you will in the ring . " There was a big egg in my throat . Cheers of fight fans never made me feel more thrilled . Next year I would go to a university . The scholarship only carried free tuition , but board and room could be easily earned in a big city like Denver . Confidently I looked into the future . I would be a great lawyer yet . J Return Battle With Myberg I will not detail the many sacrifices which my intensive study for that scholarship involved . They were many . All save one I had dismissed from my mind . That was a matter of personal honor . The miners at Cripple Creek had taken to heart the defeat of their champion and fellow worker , Lum My-berg . Manhattan 's boast of nonsuchness in its tallest skyscraper of the moment is no greater than the pride every Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the time I was concentrating on study , I was being distracted by items friends showed inc in Cripple Creek newspapers . Almost every issue contained a challenge for me to defend my new-won title against Lum Myberg . It was a real wrench to ignore those items , but I managed to , until one day a single sentence inflamed me . It said : Eagan apparently is satisfied to rest on his questionable victory over our champion . Eagan is afraid to fight . I was being called a coward . I was being branded yellow . It was the first and only time in my ring career that the word " afraid " had been applied to me . Probably never again shall I have such a mental battle to resist an impulse . I wanted to throw my books out the window and grab the first train for Cripple Creek to avenge that insult . To stick with my books was one of the hardest decisions I ever have made . That item was put away where I could find it when the time came . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Cripple Creek contumely received my first , attention . As invariably happens in a fighter 's mind , my hard-won decision over My berg had by then shaped itself as a clean-cut and decisive victory . I sent forth word that I would be glad to beat Myberg again . It was arranged that we should meet . during the Miners ' Convention in Cripple Creek early in June . So confident of victory was I that I never considered the disadvantages of meeting my opponent on his home grounds . I should have . Cripple Creek is only about a hundred miles from Longmont as the crow flies , if the crow holds to the altitude of the plains and burrows through several mountain ranges . The famous mining community is nearly two miles above sea level . It . takes time to become acclimated . A stranger to that rarefied atmosphere finds that the slightest exertion tires him as much as a day 's hard manual labor . Such fatigue often is accompanied by a. feeling of giddiness and not infrequently bleeding at the mouth and nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or mountain sickness . When Cripple Creek Entertained Earl Rice was in the Navy , so I took my brother John along as my second The miners had agreed to pay our railroad fare and board us . That is the limit of compensation that an amateur may expect . A crowd met us at . the railroad station . We had come two days before the fight to train . Already I was feeling light-headed from the unaccustomed altitude . I was a. trifle unsteady on my feet . So was John . " Glad to meet . you , boys , " said John Lewis , the miners ' chairman . " Hope you like our climate , " he added . He must have noted our reactions to the altitude . " Come on over and have a drink . " He led the way to the Miners ' Clubhouse , with the crowd trailing behind . All were anxious to see the kid who had wrested the prized D. A. C. welterweight championship from the town 's idol . I had never stood before a bar before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer . " Root beer , " I ordered , placing emphasis on the last word . " The same , " said John . We tried to appear unconcerned as the motley crowd of miners looked us over while we sipped our drinks . I felt appraising eyes running over me as I looked at . the wild-animal trophies on the wall . I was made uncomfortable by the frank comments of my hosts . " Just a kid . 11Myberg ' 11 kill ' im . " " Looks too light . to be pay dirt . " " It wo n't be a fight . It 'll be plain murder . " I spilled the contents of my glass in my embarrassment , and I was thankful when Lewis grunted an invitation to follow him to our sleeping quarters . He led us to the fire station . Bunks were given us alongside those of the regular firemen . All were Myberg fans . Training was difficult . I became winded and tired with the most modest routine of exercise . But I probably did become acclimated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restless one . The altitude added to my natural nervousness on the eve of defending my title . When I did manage to doze off , I was awakened by the clanging of the fire gong . I watched the firemen jump into their pants and coats and slide down the brass pole with the agility that comes of long practice . I got . up , fervently hoping that flames were devouring the Victor Opera House , where the fight was scheduled to be held . It would give me more time for training and to become thoroughly acclimated . But no such luck . Soon the firemen returned . " Just another clang dancing saloon , " reported Slim Sanderson , who slept in the cot beside mine . " No fun either . They 'd got all the girls and licker out before we got there . " I could not . get back to sleep . When the first red streaks showed over the eastern mountains I was still fighting Myberg in my imagination . The morning dragged away . When we arrived at . the opera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrances . It was a sell-out . Every seat and every inch of standing room already was taken . We had to shoulder our way through the mob at the door . When we gained the dressing room I noted with alarm that John was bleeding freely from the nose . The exertion of shoving through the crowd had caused it .. That did not reassure me , although John passed it off lightly . While I donned my fighting togs , he was busy applying cold compresses on his neck . The mumble and rumble of the crowd came to my ears . The fans were getting impatient . I recalled the advice of my friend in Longmont to take things easy before a fight , so I concentrated on the drawings and writings that . actor occupants had penciled on the walls . " All right , let 's go ! " It was the announcer outside the door . I walked through a narrow passage to the stage and into the glare of footlights . It was my first appearance on any stage . John trailed me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Myberg was not in his corner . A Right That Failed From my stool I looked out into a solid bank of humanity , from orchestra to gallery , hostile faces , weather-beaten faces , hard-bitten faces . There was n't a smile in a carload . Those who were not native Cripple Creekers were miners , and Lum Myberg was their brother in vocation . All felt that their hero had been robbed of the decision in Denver . They had come to see justice done , a great wrong righted , the true king recrowned . A wave of loneliness engulfed me . Never before had I felt so alone in a great big world . When Myberg slipped briskly through the ropes the rafters shook in a mighty roar of welcome . It made me feel more friendless than ever . He came directly to my corner and we examined the bindings on each other 's hands . " We do n't go in fer sentimental referees in Cripple Creek , " Myberg growled in my ear . " Th ' winner 'll get the decision here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gong . I fought off my nervousness as the referee gave us our instructions in the center of the ring . Then the bell clanged . Myberg came at me like a Kansas cyclone . I met him with a straight left to his nose that slowed his progress . Eyes blazing in anger , he charged again . Once more my left met. his nose . I followed with a vicious right to his solar plexus . " Uh-huh , " Lum grunted . That was music to my ears . All nervousness had left . me . I had fought this fight in my imagination many times . I remembered that Myberg 's favorite tactic was to wait for his opponent to walk into a right-hand wallop , which had the effect of a hand grenade . He wore a. fierce scowl to intimidate me . It did n't .. I fluttered around him like a humming bird on a trellis of flowers , pecking , jabbing , but wary . A fan 's voice reached me above the howls of the mob : " Watch your wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altitude . " Those words were more than good advice . It meant I had a friend out there . Knowing that , my heart beat a little faster in hope . I took occasion to identify that friend . He had a thin , cunning face , a sharp nose , deep-set eyes and whitened hair . I noted he had a nervous habit of snapping the fingers of his right hand . I could hear the snaps increase their tempo when the action got furious . Between rounds , John identified my friend . " That 's Lenihan , Old Silver Fox , the . gambler " John told me . " He 's backing you on the short end of 2 to 1 . " So that was why I had a friend ! Nevertheless , I recognized as sound his advice to slow down . In the ensuing round I contented myself with occasional left jabs to the face , and , whenever I could get in , right uppercuts to Myberg 's heart . Lum was desperately striving to entice me into position for his famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first thoughts always were to avoid it . Rounds followed one another in swift succession . Desperately Myberg tried for a chance to uncork his deadly right . In every clinch he panted in my ear , " I 'll get you in the next . " My confidence grew as my strength waned . " Wo n't be no next . round , " I 'd grunt back . My retort took less breath than his threat . The Sweet Music of the Bell In the fifth round Myberg looked spent . I sailed in like a ship with sails billowing. uppercutting to his jaw and stomach with either hand . It was sheer bravado . Lum was waiting . He almost knocked the ship into a dead calm with his right , to my cheek . Two inches lower and the ship undoubtedly would have sunk . As it was , I felt a mountain painfully and slowly rising on my face . Bees buzzed inside my head . Stars twinkled with the brilliance of the aurora borealis in Iceland . I never heard sweeter music than the single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my corner I felt my cheek . It seemed as though it was distended with an egg benea Ill the skin . " Snap into it this last round , " Old Silver Fox called to me as I nursed the throbbing swelling . " You 've got to get a bigger margin . Anything less 'll mean victory for Myberg . " I knew that Lenihan 's opinion was prompted by mercenary interest , but I also knew he spoke the truth . Those miners wanted Myberg to win . I breathed deeply of the thin , tobacco-filled air and tried to clear my swimming senses with a few whiffs of smelling salts . The last round had that packed auditorium in hysterics every second , yelling , screaming , shouting . It was perfect pandemonium . My head was clear again . Myberg was a battered war horse and he took all that I had , trying to connect once more with that locomotive-piston right . But he was too slow . Toe to toe we slugged , but always I was alert when I saw him whip back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , and only Lum 's straight right was to be feared . Finally he gave ground . In I went . A left hook connected on the point of his chin . He drooped , struggled to straighten his knees , then drooped again . When the bell rang he was holding himself up on the ropes . A hush came over the hall . After t he roaring noise before the bell it . was more effective than a dynamite bLast . I had learned that a boxer also must be an actor . It was up to me to appear fresh and anxious to fight on . Actually I was near collapse , breathless , thirsty  --  oh , so weary ! My ears were cocked for the referee 's words . The Ring or the Book ? That official walked toward me . He seized my hand and held it aloft . It was well that he did . I did n't feel I had the strength to do it myself . Like 4 , peal of thunder came the mob 's approval of that decision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends and admirers . I have always found fight fans fair . In a close contest there is always room for an honest difference of opinion . I have lost decisions when I honestly believed I had won fights . Sometimes the mob 's opinion was with me , sometimes not . But by and large , fight fans want a just decision . " This is my last fight . Good luck to you , Eddie , " said Lum , as I rushed to his corner to shake hands . His good wishes came from the heart . always respect him as a brave opponent .. While I was unwrapping my bandages , Old Silver Fox entered the dressing room . He waited until the inevitable crowd of handshakers had left . Then be hacked me into a corner . " You 're good , Eddie , " he said , " but you need a manager . Why don't. you turn pro ? I 've handled fighters before . Come with me and we 'll clean up . " My hands reached to my empty pockets . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still rang in my ears . The flush of victory was upon me . Maybe Lenihan was right .. If I proved a success , it would mean the end of worries for my work-worn little mother , no more manual toil . and good educations for my brothers . Was it selfish of me not to turn professional for their sakes ? I was tempted . But something inside me recalled the scholarship for which I had worked so hard . The issue shaped itself clearly . Assuming Lenihan was right , what was my choice  --  an education that would last through life , or a rocketlike career in the ring ? How high would I go ? No matter how . high , when the rocket 's force is spent , a burned-out shell falls to earth , just rubbish . " Thanks , " I. said . " You see , I 'm going to college in September and I have to stay an amateur to pla3 ? on the teams . " He looked at me with a pitying smile . " 0 . K. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard his footsteps echo down the now-deserted passageway . Was Opportunity turning its back on me ? There was yet time to call him back . No ! That still , small voice told me I was right . But was I ? .
