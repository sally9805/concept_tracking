IN more than one respect the President 's ' budget message is an unreal document . Though his policies have been repudiated at the polls , Mr. Hoover finds himself compelled to recommend new taxes and new reductions of expenditures to apply not merely to the remainder of his own term but for sixteen months beyond that . Under the circumstances it should hardly cause surprise if Congress fails to pay very careful consideration to his program . It seems more profitable , therefore , instead of taking the President 's message as a point of departure , to look at the federal budget problem afresh and in a broader perspective . In such a perspective the dominating factor is the appalling shrinkage in the income of the American people . That income was estimated in 1929 to be about $85,200,000,000 a year . It has fallen violently in each year since then , and Bradstreet 's Weekly estimates that in the current calendar year it will reach only $37,500,000,000 . The American people , in other words , now have only $44 of income for every $100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , State , and local taxation that was burdensome even in the New Era has now become close to intolerable . The real problem is obviously to reduce that tax burden . Yet this problem is receiving dishearteningly little attention , not only in Congress , but outside it . Those who are shouting most loudly that we must balance the ' budget appear to'believe that their demand is equivalent to a demand for heavier tax levies . All realistic comment must recognize , of course , the immensely greater political obstacles in the way of a reduction of expenditures as compared with an increase in taxes . Recognition of these Obstacles , however , does not mean that we should timidly abandon our efforts in that direction . So far our failure as a nation to confront this issue has been complete . The figures speak for themselves . If our federal expenditures had been reduced in proportion to the national income they would now be running at the rate of only 44 per cent of those in 1932 . Instead of a reduction of 56 per cent , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiscal year ending last June , federal expenditures reached $5,000,000,000-30 per cent more than in 1929 . In the current fiscal year the Treasury Department estimates that such expenditures will reach $4,269,000,000 ? still 11 per cent greater than in 1929 . For the fiscal year 1934 the Treasury estimate is $3,975,000,000 ? $127,000,000 higher than in 1929 . Even when one has allowed for the fixed charges an the public debt , and for the desirable increase in appropriations for public works , the complete failure of Congress and the Administration to reduce expenditures of the regular departments remains a matter for grave concern . Let us consider , - in their order , the three largest items as they appear in the estimates for expenditures in the current fiscal year : Veterans ' Administration $838,000,000 War Department $426,000,000 Navy Department $356,000,000 The expenditures for the army and navy had not been at all reduced in 1932 below those in 1929 , despite the fact that one would expect an almost automatic reduction through the fall in the price of supplies alone . Certainly the personnel of the army and navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlistments if nothing else . In the Veterans ' Bureau expenditures have greatly increased over the 1929 level , and will be even higher next year . Mr. Hoover has at least had the courage to touch on this subject . He recommends an end to some of the more flagrant payments to veterans , and estimates that this would save $127 , - 000,000 a year . The National Economy League , however , asserts that $452,000,000 annually could be saved without any loss to veterans actually disabled in the war . Anyone who seriously believes that the way to balance the budget is to reduce expenditures as far as possible rather than to increase tax returns must be prepared to accept the consequences of that belief and to state them candidly . Substantial reductions in federal expenditures can not be made without some reduction in personnel and some cuts in the pay of those who remain employed . Where it is necessary , as it often will be , to drop unneeded employees , those dropped should be put on small unemployment allowances for a definite period or until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pay must be reduced to correspond on the average with reductions in the cost of living . This reduction should preferably be graduated , running from perhaps 5 per cent on the lowest salaries to 20 per cent on the highest . President Hoover 's proposal for a reduction of 11 per cent in federal salaries over $1,000 in addition-to the present furlough system may be open to criticism in detail but seems reasonable enough in the result it aims at . The federal employees can not remain indefinitely a class protected at the expense of every other class . When the income of American farmers has fallen one-third in one year alone , when total wages and salaries , as estimated by the American Federation of Labor , have fallen 47 per cent as compared with 1929 , it hardly seems in the interests of social justice that one class  --  and that one supported by taxes on all the others  --  should hot have its pay reduced at all . It is sometimes objected that such a pay cut would reduce purchasing power and so retard revival . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be measured in terms of goods and living standards and not in terms of money . To reduce the salaries of a given group no more than living costs have fallen is not to reduce the purchasing power of that group but simply to restore it to what it was . Further , the purchasing power removed from federal employees by such moderate salary reductions is returned to the great body of the taxpayers who have lost more . On the side of revenues , there is nothing to be said in - defense of the President 's recommendation of a 2% per cent manufacturers ' sales tax . The objections to such a tax have already been stated innumerable times . It is tantamount to a 2/ per cent tax on everyone 's income regardless of his income level . It is a tax on many of the necessities of life . It would affect the net income of various manufacturers in unpredictable ways . The need for revenue would be great even if all reasonable reductions in expenditures were made , but there are many alternatives to so dangerous an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legalize the sale of beer and wine before the Eighteenth Amendment is repealed ? We feel that it would not . We believe it would be a serious mistake for Congress to enact the Collier bill or any similar measure , even for the sake of the revenue it might produce , before adequate and conclusive consideration can be given to the liquor problem as a whole . To attack this problem piecemeal , as Congress is doing , will simply add to the difficulty of arriving at a proper solution and may serve in the end to defeat the repeal movement . Let us suppose that the sale of ' beer is made lawful before the Eighteenth Amendment is done away with . What will be the most probable consequences of that act ? In the first place , it will not have the slightest effect on the evils now existing . Legal beer will lessen very little , if at all , the present demand for hard liquor . The speakeasies we shall still have with us , and the bootleggers and racketeers as well . There can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lawful beer trade . Indeed , the brewery interests have already informed government officials in Washington that if the sale of beer is legalized , steps must be taken at the same time to protect them from the racketeers . The enactment of the Collier bill would certainly put prohibition reform on trial . If this particular measure should fail to touch any of the present evils , there would be a tendency to discredit the whole movement . This would be especially true if any considerable time elapsed ' between the legalization of beer and the passage by Congress of a repeal resolution . Secondly , there is grave danger that the sale of these light beverages will delay outright repeal . Once the demand for beer has been met , the modificationists will have little inclination to continue the fight for thoroughgoing reform . It must ' be remembered in this connection that while a repeal resolution may be put through Congress , it is by no means certain that thirty-six States can be found to ratify that resolution . The recent vote in Congress indicateS pretty clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still lean toward prohibition . The ratification campaign will be endangered if the modificationists desert the movement , for they hold the balance of power between the drys and the repealists in many doubtful States , and it takes only thirteen such States to defeat repeal . Lastly , there is a great deal of hypocrisy in the present agitation for beer of alcoholic content higher than that permitted under the Volstead Act . If the 2.75 per cent beer which the Collier bill promises is not in fact intoxicating , what ' point would there be in raising the alcoholic content to this percentage ? To make the beverage more palatable or more nourishing ? That , frankly , is not what the beer-drinkers want . If the 2.75 per cent beer failed to give them the " kick " they are looking for , the Cidlier reform would have no value for them . It would be a meaningless gesture . If , on the other hand , ' beer of this alcoholic content is in fact intoxicating , its sale would violate the Constitution so long as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale of such beer would be nullification pure and simple . What the public wants is not nullification , but outright repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment . We are glad that the House of Representativesref used to be steam-rollered into accepting the Democratic repeal plan . The dry minority , though unwittingly of course , acted in the best interests of the repeal movement when it refused to bow to Speaker Garner 's demand for hasty action . The Nation no less than John Nance Garner wants the prohibition amendment abolished . On May 4 , 1932 , we said : " We shall continue to fight for rigid control and for the reeducation of the country in the direction of temperance . But for the moment this end must be subordinated to the question of repeal , and so must the question of what system shall take the place of the present rule ' by bootleggers . . . . The slate must be wiped clean before the new start is made . " But the slate may not be wiped clean if Congress acts hastily , without proper consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not quit fighting by any means . They will seek every possible legal and political loophole through which to defeat repeal . It is imperative , therefore , that the repeal resolution be made legally and politically unassailable . Congress will need more than forty minutes in which to prepare and pass such a resolution . Ships and Subsidies HE annual report of the Postmaster General has the merit of recording squarely certain payments to steamship companies and aircraft lines as subsidies . That is what they are , and that is what they should be understood to be , and not merely over-payments for the carriage of mail . By indirection and , in a sense , misrepresentation a subsidy system has been fastened upon us , whereas again and again a straight-out subsidy proposal has been defeated in the Congress of the United States . Now the Postmaster General reports that in this year of intense crisis the amount of subsidies paid to steamships and aircraft have risen from $28,218,178 in 1930 to $42,252,210 in 1932 . " In both cases , " says Mr. Brawn , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Congress to be vital to the nation 's trade and defense , the provision of postal facilities being secondary and incidental . " Although the postal deficit for the fiscal year ending June 20 , 1932 , was the staggering sum of $152,246,188 , largely because of a falling off in postal receipts of $117,000,000 from the high point of 1930 , the Postmaster General makes no recommendation whatever that there should be any limitation or reduction of the government 's support of enterprises which could not maintain themselves for a day without government aid . This aid , of course , comes directly out of the taxpayers ' pockets , and the present Postmaster General 's hands are tied because the department has obligated itself by long-term contracts for ocean-mail transportation under which the government pays subventions to equalize the cost of operating American shipping with costs under foreign flags . It this policy ever justifiable ? Possibly , when it comes to moderate aid for a new form of transportation like that of the aircraft . As for supporting ships under the American flag merely in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be justified on the ground of American vanity . The plea that it is for defense purposes is hollow if our signature to the Kellogg Pact means anything . Moreover , the subventions are not based upon a deliberate plan for reinforcing our naval strength , or for troop transportation in war time . Ships are being built for the special purposes of the trades in which they are engaged and not especially for use in another war at some indefinite time in the future . None the less , the argument is again advanced that we should not only continue the existing subventions , but should increase the amounts now paid out by the government in the face of a disappearing income and heavily increased national expenditures . The wind-bag Senator from New York , Mr. Copeland  --  as opposed to the constructive Senator , Robert F. Wagner  --  assured the public again the other day that " American independence " depended upon an adequate American fleet . Only an adequate American merchant marine , he declared , will " prevent foreign monopoly and extortion . " It is interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a public utility operated for the benefit of all the people . " Of course the subsidized ships do not serve the whole people ; the subsidies merely guarantee certain profits to the shipowners . Senator Copeland 's hoary old pretense that our prosperity depends upon shipping in American vessels was exploded generations ago . We were highly prosperous for generations , during which time our merchants shipped goods in accordance with the cheapest terms offered by bid-. ders for our foreign trade . Sometimes these were Engliehmen , sometimes Germans , sometimes Norwegians , and so on . Nobody claimed then that the American merchant would be better off if he shipped by American ships and then paid additional taxes out of his own pocket to keep those ships at sea . The Shipping Board is also determined to carry on this policy . It wants still higher mail pay for ships with a speed in excess of 24 knots . It wants the army and navy transport service sold to private interests , the Panama Railroad Steamship Company , also , and would prevent foreign ships from making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if it had not been for the government aid ladled out to private interests not many American steamship companies could have survived the depression . Meanwhile the Shipping Board is going out of the operating busins , the number of lines still operated for it having been reduced from thirteen to nine . All but 96 of the 2,546 vessels once owned by the government have been sold , scrapped , or otherwise disposed of , or laid up . Those laid up , some 240 , are also destined for the scrap heap . Thus is being wound up our tremendous war-time ship construction , which resulted in an outright loss to the taxpayers of billions of dollars to be charged against the winning of the war to end war . Even with all the sales to private operators , and the huge sums granted or lent to them , not only to build ships but to operate them on government account , American-flag lines carry only 34 per cent of the country 's export business . The board , it is needless to say , neglected to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks only to government pap , has had a great deal to do with the demoralization of the Atlantic trade . The weakest company in that trade is the United States Lines , whose flagship , the Leviathan , left New York recently with only 178 passengers , in number hardly one-fourth of the crew . But what of it ? America must not be subjected to the horrible infamy of again sending its products abroad under other flags than our own  --  not if there is a taxpayer still left to be assessed .
