txt For the previous failure of the AAA to publish the facts regarding the recipients of large benefits , Secretary WALLACE has made two explanations . One of these is the amount of clerical work it would have involved , the other the fear of the " exploitation to which " farmers , by such a practice , would " have been exposed . " Both reasons seem oddly inconsistent coming from the Federal Government . That Government insists that all income-tax payers present complete records on demand ; it has for years required through the I. C. C. that the railroads compile the most detailed and voluminous uniform reports , and through the SEC it has extended similar demands to all corporations that issue securities . Complaints that any of these demands involve expensive and burdensome clerical labor are either derided or ignored . As for the possible " exploitation " of those whose receipts are made public , it did not act as a deterring consideration with those who voted for the publicity of income-tax returns and for the stillexisting practice of publishing all corporation salaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid out of the taxpayers ' money , while the AAA benefits are . The detailed statements now being published need not cause any surprise to those who understand the principles on which the AAA operated . That three sugar corporations , one in Florida , one in Puerto Rico and one in Hawaii , received approximately $1,000 , - 000 each for not raising sugar , that one planter received $124,000 in one year for not raising cotton , and that one hog-farming company received $157 , - 000 for not raising hogs , do not indicate the presence of any administrative impropriety or irregularity . The results were implied in the theory of the AAA itself , which treated all producers , large and small , proportionately . But the figures do serve the useful purpose of putting some aspects of the AAA under a magnifying glass . The money that was paid out in these large individual benefits was raised through processing taxes  --  that is , through sales taxes averaging about 30 per cent on some of the necessaries of life . These taxes were paid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiving an average of about $20 a week , but by persons on relief . One effect of the AAA , therefore , was to transfer purchasing power from the poorest persons paying the processing tax to the large agriculturalists . It may be contended by supporters of the agricultural program that this was a minor inequity which is unimportant when the total effect is considered . But it is at least well that this aspect of the AAA should not be overlooked . For what were these large agriculturalists , as well as the smaller ones , being subsidized ? They were being subsidized , in effect , to reduce their own output so that they could get higher prices for it . The consumer not only paid the processing tax , but the higher price . Purchasing power was not created by the AAA ; it was merely transferred from one group to another . Again it may be argued that this transfer was necessary and justifiable in an emergency . But the principle that any group of producers should be subsidized for reducing its production can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be universalized without impoverishing every one .
