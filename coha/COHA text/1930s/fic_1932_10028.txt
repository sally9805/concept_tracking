The sheriff followed us home , and I sat and listened while Adela gave a description of the vanished diamonds . I can still hear her deliberate voice : " One ring , set with a carat diamond , a blue Jaegar , and two pearls . " And Jim Strove scratching away in a notebook : " How do you spell Jaegar ? " " Two carat Wesseltons set in a ring with a design of clasped hands . One necklace , eleven diamonds . One sunburst , twenty-six  --  oh , but you would know my mother 's sunburst anywhere , Mr. Strove . You 've seen her wear it hundreds of times . " " Oh , sure , Miss Adela . But I 've got to telegraph this all over the country . You 'll have to give me a more detailed description of the stones . Do n't you have awritten record ? A jeweler 's " Yes . Yes . Very well . One sunburstOn and on it went , emblematic of a time when a family was scarcely a family until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and diamonds . The collection was not enormous , and none of the pieces was very valuable ; still , all put together it was nothing to be sneezed at . I left them presently and went to my own room to change from the street gown I had worn at the inquest . I found Florrie there , her stolidity shaken and her hair a bit wild . She was changing the bed , flourishing the sheets widely . She gave a little gasp when I entered . " Do you mind , ma'am , " she said , " if I finish the room while you are here ? " And as I said no , she continued , " I 'm late about things this morning . Seems likep101I 'm kind of nervous . Keep feeling like something 's coming at me from behind . " " Nonsense . Not in broad daylight . " She gave me a slow look . " It happened yesterday in broad daylight , " she said , shaking out a pillow case . Well , of course that was true . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one corner between her teeth and speaking through them  --  her teeth , I mean -- so that her words had a sort of hissing ferocity  --  " it can happen again . " " Nonsense , " I repeated . And because I rather agreed with her than otherwise I said briskly , " Nothingis going to happen . You 're a little nervous , that 's all . " " And who would n't be nervous ? " she asked fiercely . " A man shot all to pieces in the very house . Mark my words , ma'am , it ai n't going to end there . You see , " she added , releasing the pillow and speaking with greater clearness , " I 'm a seventh daughter . " " A seventh daughter ! Do you mean a Native daughter ? Or a Daughter of the Revolution ? Or a By the way , has n't Miss Thatcher told you notto hold pillows between your teeth like that ? " " Yes , " she admitted . " But when I get excited I sort of forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seventh daughter . " It began to sound like a lodge . She picked up the other pillow , caught it expertly between her teeth , and hissed , " I see things ! " " You see things ! What on earth She took the pillow out of her mouth and said , " 1 mean I see things . I 've got second sight . That is , sonictimesI have second sight . And I 've got it right now . I see trouble . " Her earnestness was rather convincing . I was a little taken aback and vaguely uneasy in the face of such certainty . " Why , you ca n't ! " I cried . " That 's all nonsense . " She gave me a strange look ; her plain face was still , almost trance-like . " Ca n't I ? " she said in a low voice . " Then why do I feel death in this house ? Why did my mother know it yesterday ? Before we had heard what happened here . Why did she say to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thatcher house . There 's been trouble there . ' " The girl took a step or two in my direction , and I found myself retreating a little . " And there was trouble , was n't there ? When I got back last night . There 'd been murder . And I see  --  " she was motionless now , her eyes fixed in a vacant way  --  " I see more trouble . I see death . " I had reached the window . I pressed against the ledge , took a deep breath , and said crisply , though a bit jerkily : " Now , Florrie , stop talking like that . I shall be obliged to tell Miss Thatcher , if you keep this up . You are hysterical . You are letting your imagination run away with you . Stop it at once and get back to your work . " She was not at all affected . Her face did not alter its still look , but she went back to the bed.  | " It 's coming , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I 'm afraid . I 'm afraid where murder is going to strike next . " " That 's enough , " I said sharply . " Very well , ma'am . But my mother 's always warned me . She sees clearer than I do . She 's had more experience . And she says I 've got to guard against being murdered in my sleep . " " M-murdered " The girl nodded . " In my sleep . It 's got to be a full moon and something out of a box . I always lock my door when it 's a full moon . But there 's never till now been the third thing . " " The  --  third thing --  " " Yes . Mother says when all three things are there I 've got to protect myself . Or I 'll be murdered in my sleep . The trouble is to come from the third thing , and that is  --  " she tucked the counterpane deftly over the pillows  --  " a red-headed woman . Your hair 's red , ai n't it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your senses . What do you mean ! Do you think I 'm going to murder you ? " " I did n't say that , " she said . " But your ham 's red , ai n't it ? " " It is auburn . And if you keep on talking like this , my girl --  " " It looks red to me . And I 'm just telling you . I suppose it sounds silly to you . Maybe it is . But Mother 's never yet been wrong . What kind of soap do you want , ma'am ? " pIO4 " Your mother likely knew from what you 'd said that Mr. Bayard had been wounded by a revolver shut and that I 'd come to nurse him , " I said , although I could n't have told why I chose to explain the absurd affair . " Of course , she would say there was troublc coming . " " H'mm , " said Florrie . She gave me a long and singularly discerning look . " H'mm . So you knew it was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " What do you mean ? " " What do I mean ? " she repeated with a sort of scorn . " I mean , I 've got eyes in my head . And ears . 1 f you 'd heard what I heard She glanced nervously at the door and leaned toward me . " I heard them quarreling , Bayard and Allen Carick . They was right outside the kitchen window , there on the path . I was wiping dishes . I heard Allen Carick say , I 'll kill you for this . ' And Bayard laughed . And that very night he was shot . Accidentally ! Accidentally on purpose , I say . " " But  --  did Allen Carick shoot him ? " She frowned suspiciously at me , as if I were trying to trap her . She had colorless eyebrows over light greenish eyes , and a broad , clean-looking face ; her absurdly primitive superstitions went badly with her prim green uniform . " I do n't know , " she said . " But I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threaten to ? Bayard and Dave was thick as thieves . That is , most of the time they was . But they had their quarrels . The Thatchers are like that . To look at them you 'd thinkpI06 there never was such a loving family . It 's different when you know them like I know them . " " You must not talk like this , Florrie . " " You wo n't tell , " said the girl easily . " And I 'm kind of nervous . Seems like I ca n't settle down . It 's your hair , ma'am , that 's got me upset . Right after the murder , too . To think of me being in the house where there 's been a murder . " Her green eyes looked strange and trancelike again , and she said , " I think things would be better , ma'am , if you was to leave . " I thought so myself . But not for the same reason . " Why do n't you leave if you 're afraid of  --  more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a good job , " she said . " And I 'll keep my door locked nights . " I did not like the way she looked at me . I said , " My box from the hospital has n't come yet . I think I 'll telephone again , " and walked toward the door . " There 's a telephone in Miss Adela 's morning room . You 'll use that , I suppose , ma'am ? " " Why  --  yes . Or the telephone in the study off the library . " " Oh , do n't use that one , ma'am . That 's in Dave 's room . Mr. Dave 's room , I mean . You see , we all went to grade school together , and I ca n't remember to say Mr. Dave , like Miss Adela says to . " " But why should n't I use that telephone ? " I asked . " There 's nothing wrong with it , is there ? " " Oh , we never go into Mr. Dave 's room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poetry or something . At least , everyone says he writes . I 've never seen a scrap of it , myself . But nobody goes near that room . He keeps it locked most of the time . " " It was n't locked yesterday afternoon . " " Oh , was n't it ! ' Well , it usually is . I suppose he forgot . Miss Adela says we must n't ever bother him . Not even to dust . She says some day we 'll be proud of him . I do n't think so myself . I think it 's silly . Look at all the books there are already . What do they want more books for ? " But there 's one good thing , " she continued rather resentfully . " Since he 's got that soundproof stuff in the walls and door she does n't go around shushing everybodyfor fear we 'll botherI was at her side , seizing her by the shoulders . " What did you say ? What do you mean ? " She backed away , writhing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat 's . " Do n't you touch me , " she cried . " You keep away from me . I can protect myself , I can . You stay away . " " Oh , for heaven 's sake ! I 'm not going to hurt you . Do n't be such an idiot . Tell me what you mean . Where is there soundproofing ? Is it in Dave 's study ? When you 're in that room , can you hear anything that goes on outside  --  in another room ? Is the study really soundproof ? " My eager questions confused and frightened her . She backed steadily toward the door . " I mean he  --  Dave  --  fixed it so when the door is closed and you are in the study you might as well be ap108hundred miles away from the rest of the house so as hearing anything 's concerned . You ca n't hear sound . But do n't you go grabbing me like that again ma'am . I do n't like it . Not in anybody with hair like yours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n  --  alone . " " You are an out-and-out fool , " I snapped . " Get out of my sight before I do something to you ! " It was an unfortunate choice of words . She turned a faint green , scooped up the stack of linen , anti vanished , all but slamming the door behind her , anti leaving me in a turmoil of conflicting emotions . I longed to shake the girl until her silly teeth rattled . I felt uneasy and very unhappy in that suddenly quirt room , and more than anything I was excited by my discovery . A soundproof room . That would explain why I had heard no sound of the revolver shot that killed Bayard . And it would explain the blood on the rug in the study . Bayard Thatcher had actually been killed in that little study . I was morally certain of it . But the wound was such that he could not possibly have walked from the study to the library in which he was found . And the door to that little study was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Dave . It was definitely Dave 's room . Why had Bayard been moved to the library after his death ? Who had moved him ? Who had closed his eyes ? Dave was fishing , though , all the afternoon of the murder , with Allen Carick . With Allen Carick . Why had Allen Carick and Bayard quarreled so bitterly that Allen had threatened kill Bayard ? Had Allen actually attempted to do ? Was that the explanation of that first attack upon ayard ? And there was Janice  --  Janice of the still face and c unfathomable dark eyes . Had she shot Bayard hatcher in the quiet little study  --  opened the door , en , and dragged that shattered , dying body across e library ? The thought chilled me . I could see her slender body ending to the effort , her white hands avoiding stain . stirred impatiently , trying to escape the ugly thought . er letter : I must find some way to return it . The tter being what it was , I could scarcely walk up to her nd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and read it , and ere it is . " Lunch that day was a strange meal which , in spite  --  f the grave and dreadful circumstances , assumed an ! most festive air , owing to the guests  --  for Dr. ouligny was present , also , besides Hilary and Evelyn nd Allen Carick  --  and the arrival of numerous teleramswhich began to flow in as Evelyn 's messages ofe morning reached their various destinations and ere answered . Adela presided . She looked unutterblyweary , but she was serene , less cold and severe ow that the danger of the inquest was passed ; her ray hair was smooth , her eyeglasses shining , and she ad taken the pains , even , to change into a soft gray chiffon gown with flowing sleeves , and was wearing her amethysts . Janice and Evelyn , thoroughbreds too , played up to Adela.  |p110It  was more difficult for the men . Dr. Bouligny was frankly nervous and unable , apparently , to get his mind off the inquest . He was , I think , a little trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very cold look after he 'd said something to the effect that he was glad it was safely over , and pointedly turned the conversation to the weather . Hilary did n't speak at all , but looked very pink and worried , and once , when he looked up from his salad suddenly and caught me watching him  --  I was thinking , as a matter of fact , that it would n't hurt him to diet  --  he flushed angrily and returned my look with one of positive malevolence . Already I had grown accustomed to Dave 's silence . He had never a good appetite , and how well I remember him sitting morosely beside Evelyn and unheeding Adela 's continual looks . Allen , of course , was there too ; also quiet and having difficulty keeping his eyes from Janice . And Emmeline and Florrie in the background . Along toward dessert I caught Florrie 's eyes and was a little disturbed by the look in them , and she served me in such a wary and distant manner that I was quite obliged to snatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking back , that I recall those meals with particular clarity ; perhaps it is because at those times the whole family was present , seated around that long gracious table with its ever sparkling crystal and gleaming silver and lovely old china . There were always flowers from the gardens , heavy crimson roses or tall gladioluses . And there was always excellentfood , well served . But the significant thing , the thing that caught mypIIIimagination , was the presence of the Thatchers . Adela , determined , poised , resolute ; Hilary , frightened ; Evelyn , cool and practical ; Dave , always a puzzle , and Janice and Allen deep in their own urgent problem  --  and all of them , even Dr. Bouligny and Emmeline and Florrie , contributing in some measure to that tragic mystery . It is a rather curious tribute to the Thatchers that I could not  --  I simply could not feel that I was sitting at the same table with a murderer . One who is forever cut off from his fellow man by reason of that dark and dreadful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel a little faint and sick , and I put down my fork . But just then Emmeline brought another telegram , and Adela opened it in a leisurely way , adjusted her eyeglasses , read it slowly to herself , and then deliberately and blandly , as if she were reading a newspaper , read it aloud . " It 's from Cousin Helen , " she said . " She says , Received . telegram shocked and grieved Tommy down with measles love . ' " Carefully Adela folded up the telegram and replaced it in its envelope . " Exactly ten words , " she remarked blandly . " Helen Thatcher was never one to waste money . " " She 's not coming to the funeral , then , " said Evelyn . " I doubt if anyone comes . She is the nearest . There is n't quite time enough for anyone else to get here . " " You told everyone what time it would be ? " asked Adela . " Oh , yes . I said in my telegrams nine o'clock tomorrowmorning. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way , Hilary , you might ask Dr. Lyman to call this afternoon to make arrangementsabout the services . " " You are going to hold it here ? In the house ? " asked Dr. Bouligny . Again that touch of granite was in Adela 's face . But she said calmly : " Why , yes . I think that 's best . Do n't you , Hilary ? " " I do n't care where it is , " said Hilary , pink and agitated . " Only , for God 's sake , get it over as soon as you can Evelyn interrupted hurriedly . " So Tommy 's got measles . Actually that child has everything . " And Janice continued at once : " This time he 's got something twice . He had measles last winter , too . " " Probably , " said Adela , " it 's just a rash . Children are so apt to get a rash in the summer time . Hilary , now , always broke out after he 'd had strawberries . " By that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite heartily . The afternoon was long and warm and , save for the coming and going of various callers and messengers , quiet . Adela rested for some time , although she came downstairs when Dr. Lyman called about four , and I sat in the little morning room with Evelyn and Janice , helping them write notes , receive telephone calls and telegrams , and dispose of a number of tremulous female visitors . Around six a Mrs. Whiting arrived ; she , I had nop113doubt , of the cod-liver-oil notoriety , an indomitable woman with a chin . She had all the air of an intimate of the household and talked steadily and with not areat amount of tact . I think it was when she said she ad just been in her husband 's place of business and hat Bayard was going to look very well that Janice ave a little gasp and rose , looking rather white , andasked me somewhat incoherently if I did n't want a walk . I followed her at once . Behind us I heard Mrs. Whiting boom , " Janice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . She has n't looked well all summer . She is n't worried about anything , is she ? How is Dave ? " We did n't hear the reply . " She is a dreadful woman , " said Janice in a low voice . " I feel guilty leaving poor Evelyn to her , but I  --  I simply ca n't stay there and listen to her . Let 's slip out to the garden for a moment . It will be such a rest after this terrible day . Oh  --  " she caught her breath  --  " oh , I did n't see you , Allen . " Allen rose from a chair and crossed the porch . " I 'll go along , if you do n't mind , " he said . Janice slipped her hand under my arm . Her fingers were rather tight upon it . It was almost as if she 'd said , " Stay with me . " But she actually said : " Why , of course , Allen . " And the three of us walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their masses of gorgeous summer color amid green paths . It was a lovely place ; a serene and happy place and a beautiful one . But I looked up and saw the vine-twine balcony that led to what had been Bayard Thatcher 's room , and recalled the midnight visitor on that bal  --  cony , and things were not so lovely or so peaceful . I was conscious , too , of the effort Janice and Allen were making to talk in an easy and natural way for my ears . I felt a sort of pity as I watched the two  --  0 Janice so lovely , now , her whole face animate with beauty , and Allen so carefully restrained , so determinedlyquiet , his firm mouth rather tight , but his blue eyes vivid and almost vehement as he watched Janice . Yet , as if it had been a living thing , I was aware of the feeling that existed between them . I think that even if I had not known what I knew  --  and what they did not dream of my knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound them to each other whether they liked or not ; the thing that was like a current flowing through them and drawing them irresistiblytogether . But only once was there any outward evidence of it . That was when we reached the rose garden , which was just below the balcony I knew so well and rioted in beauty and extravagant color and fragrance . Janice stopped before one of the bushes , looked at the flowers for a moment , and then bent , graceful and lovely in her soft green gown , and picked one of the heavy crimson roses and held it against her soft cheek . I do n't think she knew exactly what she was doing or how the sweetness of that little caress must affect the man who watched her . I 'm sure she did not know how beautiful she looked with the slanting sunlight gently warm onpI15her hair , her body slim and yet round under her thin ck , whose delicate green was outlined against the deeper greens of the foliage , and her white arm lifted th that deep crimson rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty . We had paused to wait for her . I suppose we both red at her , marveling  --  Allen until he could bear it longer . I heard him take a quick breath , and heepped suddenly to her side and took the hand with the rose in it and looked down at her face , and then as ruptly released her hand and turned away , rather white , and said a little breathlessly : " Beautiful roses . Fragrant . Those roses below the balcony . They are nice . " " Yes , " said Janice . " Yes , they are lovely things . id you ever see such heavy clusters as we have this ar ? " " Those roses below the balcony "  --  " Those roses be-w the balcony . " I did not enjoy the rest of the walk ; mind was too busy with the fragrance of the roses hen drenched with summer rain . And with the memofa shadow on that balcony . What had Florrie id about Allen quarreling with Bayard ?  --  but I uld recall all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark of Janice 's that aroused me. " . . . must get Aunt Ella 's address so as to get her letter off in tonight 's post . Her address is in my desk pstairs , and if I go through the hall Pearl Whiting ill clutch me . Do you suppose the woman intends to ay forever ? Poor Evelyn  --  I should n't have run way . " PI16 " Oh , Evelyn can take care of herself , " said brother carelessly . And then I remembered the letter . I would be alit to slip into Janice 's room and leave the thing ; on lie desk where she could not fail to find it . She would have to get the address almost immediately if she wanted to catch the evening post , and that being th case , I ran little risk of the letter being found by someone else . Ignoring Janice 's clasp on my arm and the unconscious appeal in her dark eyes , I left the two in th garden , crossed the quiet green lawn where the shadows were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall . From the little morning room I caught the steady boom of Mrs. NV hit . ing 's voice , and as I went to the stairway Hilary came out of the library , saw me , gave me what I thought was an unreasonably annoyed look  --  after all , I could scarcely help being some place , and the stairway was certainly an inoffensive spot  --  and backed into th library again . No one was about upstairs . The letter was still where I had replaced it , tucked carefully out of sight in my instrument bag . I slipped it into my pocket and went into the hall again . Down toward the back , Florrie , formal now in her afternoon black , whisked out of a door with a stack of towels over one arm . I approached her , disregarding the far from flattering gesture with which she flung the arm with the towels on it in front of her like a shield.  | " Where , " I said with dignity , " is Miss Janice 's urn ? " Florrie stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Second door from the windows , " e said with brevity , and vanished , closing the door mly behind her . East side front . Second door from the windows . After a moment during which I rather felt that orrie was listening from the other side of the doorr my retreating footsteps , I walked slowly and oughtfully toward the front of the hall  --  past my rmer patient 's door , past the stair well , past the ng mirror . It had been Janice , then  --  Janice who had tched me , Janice who must have tried to enter yard 's room that strange night . Well , I would return the letter . Cautiously , feeling guilty in spite of my honorable rand , I reached the door , opened it , and entered . I lanced backward down the hall as I did so and was a the disconcerted to see a white cap flash out of sight ound a doorway , but continued . I did not stop to look about me , though one brief since gave me a picture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its lack of over-adornment , bit austere and the more beautiful thereby . I went directly to the desk . On its darkly gleaming surfaces a vase , some kind of gray-white pottery it was , ed with an enormous cluster of the deep crimson es I had seen Janice caress there in the garden . I tcd the vase a bit and slipped the letter barely underp118its edge ; it could not be blown off the desk by any stray current of air and it was very prominent against t dark wood . Then I left . The whole thing had taken scarcely a moment . Once in my own room I left the door ajar so I could Janice pass on her way to her room . When I ha seen her enter her room I should feel that the late was safe in her hands again . But in a moment or two Florrie went past . Vague uneasy , I started toward the door . If she entered t room  --  if she found and looked at Janice 's letterI was on the very point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescue the letter , when there were light footsteps along the hall , and Janice at last passed . I caught just a glimpse of her light green frock and her dark hair . I stepped into the hall in time to see her enter her room . If Florrie had not preceded her all would be well . But Florrie had . There were voices , not loud but audible in the quiet of the hall . I walked slowly aloof the hall . And I heard Janice say distinctly : " Put that down at once . You will regret this , Florrie . " And Florrie said , " I did n't read a word . I did n't know  --  it was here  --  I was tidying up the  --  I thought " You may go . " To escape Florrie I retired somewhat hastily to Adela 's room , the door of which stood conveniently open behind me . Unfortunately Florrie followed mep119the room , and I was obliged further to retreat to bathroom , where I sat on the edge of the tub andtuned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thought of Janice that I did notnote her departure . It was with a decided shock that as suddenly aware that with her exit someone else entered Adela 's room . That the door to the halls closed with decision . And that someone was say-. . and get him away before someone finds out shot Bayard. "  |p120IT  WAS Evelyn 's voice . I sat down again on the bathtub . No one answered her for a moment . There w a sound of motion , as if someone sat down on a chaff and I heard a window shade being pulled . Then a m  --  it was Hilary  --  spoke . " What do you think , Adela ? " Adela and Evelyn and Hilary . A confidential family conference , and I was sitting on the bathtub hearing every word of it . I started to make my presence known And Adela said : " It 's the nurse . She 's our danger . " " That 's right . If we can silence her We ough never to have got her here , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Adela . " But at the time L thought it was the best thing to do . After what ha pened . I thought she would stand between them , in sense . Bayard refused to leave ; I could n't send hi , away sick  --  after that . " " But I do n't like her , " said Hilary in a peevish way . " She makes me nervous . Always about where you do n't expect her . " There was a short pause during which I wondered what Hilary would do if he knew where I was at that moment ; then he continued , still rather fretfully : uo " Why did n't you let her leave right away after he s killed ? I do n't understand you , Adela . She 's right here among us , seeing our every move . How long do u think we can keep her thinking it was a burglar of him ? " " But it was a burglar who shot him , " said Adela stobbornly . " And think , Hilary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away unconvinced . I can see doubt in her eyes . I could see it yesterday afternoon , ere in the library . We 've got to keep her here . Where can watch her . " " Indefinitely ? " asked Hilary unpleasantly . " Do n't talk that way , Hilary , " said Evelyn sharply . dela 's quite right about it . You can manage the criff , and Adela can manage Dan Bouligny , and all us together can face down the talk in the county . ' s that nurse who is our problem . It 's she who threat-s us . But I do n't know what we are going to do about Of course , we ca n't keep her here forever . She keeps ying she must go ; I think she suspects . You 'll have think up things for her to do , Adela , to keep her " Do n't you see , Hilary , " said Adela . " If we can nvince her that it was done by a burglar  --  somebody anybody but one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we can keep her here somehow and anage to prove to her that no one in the family had had anything to do with Bayard 's death , we have , actically speaking , convinced the world . " " It wo n't be easy , " said Hilary . " She 's got the arpest eyes I ever saw . But you may be right . I didn't exactly like the way she looked at me this morn ' Do you realize that if she had n't been sitting in tit confounded arbor all yesterday afternoon we wouldn have a thing to worry about ? Nobody else knew 1 w here ; nobody would have known Evelyn was here ; burglar could have entered by the front door . Oh , i that damn nurse that 's got everything in a snarl . " I paused and after a moment added , " As it is , I expect any moment to hear somebody 's been saying I kill him . Everybody knows we never liked each other . " There was another pause , and then Adela said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bayard had n't had any particula trouble about anything , had you ? " " No , " he said explosively . " Good God , no ! What do you mean , Adela ? " " I do n't mean anything , Hilary . I only want to be sure you had had no trouble . You see , even if everyone does know you were not friendly , still , they can have nothing definite to say . No definite cause , I mean , for you  --  for you " For me to have shot him , I suppose you mean , Adela , " blurted Hilary disagreeably . Evelyn mur. mured warningly : " Now , Hilary  --  now , be careful , " and Hilary went on , " Well , get this into your head , Adela . I did n't shoot him . I always hated him , and you know why . And he hated me . But I did n't shoot him . " " Look out , Hilary , " said Adela coolly . " Your face is terribly red . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell , " said Hilary . " Do you thinkP123going to sit here and let even you accuse me of rdering a man ? There are limits , Adela --  " " Hilary ! " said Evelyn sharply . " You are forgetting rself . Adela 's the best friend you 've got , and you ow it . And anyway  --  maybe there was a burglar . ere are the diamonds , you know . " " The diamonds ! " cried Hilary . " Yes , and where e they ? That 's another thing I do n't understand out this . Dave says he knows nothing of them . They doubtedly were gone from the safe when Adela . ened it there right after the murder . Those diamondsare worth a lot . We 've got to get hold of them . " " To my notion , " said Evelyn bluntly , " the disaparanceof the diamonds is the only hopeful aspect of e whole situation . I do n't want to know what 's hapnedto them . And the nurse was there and saw with er own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e Adela , that it 's worth the price . " " You women , " said Hilary hopelessly , " are crazy sometimes I think I 'm crazy too . You insist that there as a burglar and that he stole the diamonds and that ou 're glad of it . In the next breath you practically ccuse me of killing Bayard , and then you " Hilary . " It was Adela , her voice lower than usual and very quiet , and so stripped of its usual affectation that it seemed indecently bare and significant . " Hilary , what did you and Bayard talk of when you came here yesterday afternoon ? " " Why , I  --  that is , we  --  we talked of  --  I do n't know exactly . " He stopped , floundering , cleared his throat , and said , " Why do you want to know , Adela ? "   " Because , " said Adela slowly , " that 's what people will want to know . Are you quite sure , Hilary , that you  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued  --  " that you talked to him at all ? " I could hear him spring to his feet and his quick footsteps on the floor . " What do you mean by that , Adela ? I swear I did n't shoot him . I did n't kill him . I had no reason to kill him . You  --  you are driving me mad ! " His voice was shaking with rage and a kind of fright . " Are you sure , " said Adela , " that you had no reason ? " " Adela , you are driving me out of my senses . You make it sound as if I 'd sneaked into the house and shot him dead before he could even call for help or defend himself . And I did n't . I tell you , I did n't ! " His voice had lifted as if he were approaching hysteria . " Now then , Hilary , you must learn to control yourself . " It was Evelyn , speaking with the infuriating coolness of a long-married wife . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Look at your face there in the mirror . For heaven 's sake , cool down a little . Adela has n't accused you of anything . She only asked you to tell her what you talked about . That ought to be easy . " " What did he say over the phone to you , Adela ? " asked Hilary . " Scarcely a word , " said Adela . " Just yes ' and all right . ' You did n't even speak to him , Evelyn , when you stopped for Hilary ? " " Not a word , " said Evelyn steadily . " Did n't he even hear you come to the door ? "   " No , " said Evelyn . " No . He did n't hear me . I saw Hilary had gone , so I did n't linger . " " Oh , Evelyn , " cried Adela , suddenly losing her customarydeliberation of manner and speaking with a sort of burst , " why do n't you tell me the truth ? There is something you and Hilary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel it . You must tell me . We can only save ourselves by knowing everything . If you saw anything  --  know anything " " Nothing , Adela . Nothing , " said Evelyn . " You are nervous . You " " Nervous , nothing ! " cried Adela with a sharp fury of which I should n't have believed her capable . " You treat me like an old woman . And it 's my house . And my family . And I 've got to know . " " Get her a drink of water , Evelyn , " said Hilary . " Now  --  now , Adela I lost the rest of his admonition . " Get her a drink of water . " Evelyn would be at the bathroom door in another moment . A purely primitive terror gripped me . They had said I was a danger . They were implacable . What would they do to me if they discovered I had heard every damning word they 'd said ! Then common sense returned , and I realized they could n't do anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bayard . My eyes were going frantically about the small room and discovering that a flea would have had difficulty hiding for long in the glittering expanse of porcelain and white walls , let alone a woman of not inconsiderableheight and a weight that  --  well , never mind myp126weight . Even the shower was caged in shining glass . And the door began to open . It opened several inches . I can not describe my feelingas I watched it . And in the very nick of time Hilary , from the bedroom , said : " No , Evelyn , here 's some sherry . That will be better . Here , Adela , drink this . You ought not to overtax your heart like that . " Evelyn moved away from the door ; I could feel rather than hear her withdrawal . And the door , left to itself , swung gently and slowly to its original position . But my heart was pounding so heavily that for a moment or two I actually could not hear what they were saying in the next room. " . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hilary was saying when I regained my senses . " We know damn well that somebody in the family killed him . And it 's not a nice thing to know . Ours is not a big family . But all this talk 's doing no good . We 've got to arrange to get Dave away from here . Before the nurse gets onto things . " " What 's your plan about the nurse ? " asked Evelyn . " You do feel better , do n't you , Adela ? " " I do n't feel ill at all , " said Adela crisply . " And I do n't want Dave to leave just now . He 's not well , and I think he 's terribly depressed over Bayard 's death . But about the nurse . I think I can manage her . You see , if I can prove to her that it must have been the burglar  --  as , of course , it was , " she interpolated hurriedly  --  " thatno one of the family killed him , thenp127we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against us . And I think I can . " " It wo n't be easy , " said Hilary thoughtfully . " I wonder if Bayard told her anything before he died . Do you suppose he did ? I wonder  --  " he paused and went on finally  --  " I wonder if she knows who shot him . " " I 've wondered that , too , " said Evelyn . " It seems to me she 's got a sort of knowing look . You were n't too careful what you said at breakfast about the in-quest . " " But we did n't mention him . " " I was n't there , " said Adela . " What was it ? " " Nothing at all , " said Hilary in a blustering way , as if he had been called to account and felt guilty . " Only enough to let her know that you were managingthe inquest to suit yourself . The veriest child would have known you were trying to hide something . You and Dr. Dan . Where were you this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came up here after breakfast , and you had gone . Poor old Pansy looked like she 'd lost her last friend . " " I had just gone for a little walk , " said Adela blandly . " I needed some fresh air . I woke up feeling stuffy . What about Dave , now ? I do n't really like him to leave just now . " " He 's got to leave , " said Hilary . " He 'll give himselfaway . " " Hilary ! " said Adela sharply . " You do n't think Dave killed Bayard ? " There was a long silence . Then Hilary said with difficulty :   " No , Adela . No . But we all know he tried to kill him the other night . It was n't his fault Bayard dodged and the bullet caught him in the shoulder . Dave would have shot again and killed him then and there if you had n't interfered . It 's lucky you heard and got there in time to grab Dave 's hand . Talk him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his senses . " " But he did n't kill him that night , " said Adela . She spoke with accentuated care and slowness , as if her mouth were stiff . " And yesterday , when Bayard was actually killed , Dave and Allen were together all afternoon . That proves it was n't Dave , Hilary . That proves it . You dare not call your own brother a murderer . And I wo n't have him sent away . " There was a knock at the door , and without waiting for answer someone opened it . " There are ways , " Evelyn was saying . " People have been silenced " when her voice broke off sharply . I could feel the sudden silence and restraint in the room beyond . Then someone moved and Adela said with a sort of relief in her voice : " Oh , it 's you , Emmeline . What is it ? " " Some newspaper men from the city , ma'am . They want to take some pictures and ask you some ques-tions . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see them . " " Wait , Adela . You ar - making a mistake . We ca n't afford to antagonize the press , " said Hilary heavily . " Tell the gentlemen , Emmeline , that we 'll see them , Can you bear it , Adela ? "  | " You are quite right , Hilary , " said Adela . " Just let me look at myself in the mirror . Do you want some powder , Evelyn ? Your eyes are rather red . Better touch them with water . " " Hurry up , " said Hilary impatiently . " But , for heaven 's sake , be careful what you say . Better let me do the talking . " " My dear Hilary , " said Adela somewhat waspishly . " Nothing would suit me better . Come , Evelyn . " I heard them leave . I heard the diminishing murmur of voices , the rustle of footsteps on rugs and of Adela 's skirts . Even then it was a moment or two before I dared peer through the crack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose and did not draw a free breath until I was safe in my own room . So it was Dave . Dave . It had been in Dave 's study that Bayard was killed . 1 felt certain of that . The blood on the rug in the study and no sound of the revolver shot  --  yes , I was sure Bayard had been killed in Dave 's study . Dave 's revolver with its two shots gone . Dave himself , silent , languid , morose  --  entirely perplexing . And Dave had made that first attempt to murder Bayard . He would have shot again , they said , if Adela had not stopped him . I had been convinced all along that when I knew who had shot Bayard that first time , when only his shoulder was wounded , I would know who had finally murdered him .   But Dave had been with Allen all that long after . noon . Allen had quarreled bitterly with Bayard . Dave had taken a revolver and shot Bayard . But both the men had alibis for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who , then , could have killed him ? It was curious that , as I thought of the Thatcher family , the only member of it who seemed psychologically capable of cold-blooded murder was Evelyn . Evelyn with her firm brown hands and her bluntness and her matter-of. fact way of looking at things . If , for some good reason , she had made up her mind that Bayard should be got out of the way she would kill him with as little compunction as she would step on a spider . After it was over she would not harass herself with fears or doubts or regrets ; she would act exactly as she had acted  --  write her notes , send her telegrams , meet and calmly dispose of callers , help with household matters . The only signs of weakness she had displayed about the whole ugly business were when she had said , there over Bayard 's dead body in the library , " What will people say ? " And that was not exactly a sign of weakness . The other was more significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  come home to that grim and sordid tragedy of murder . Even an unimaginativewoman would not want her sons entangled in the murder she had done . And so far as material evidence went  --  which after all is rather conclusive , for there 's no getting around it , if a man 's killed with a bullet that bullet 's got to come out of a gun , and guns do n't fire themselves  --  soP131far as material evidence went she  --  or Janice  --  was the st one known to have seen Bayard alive . Well , it had been a strange conversation I had card ; it seemed to me that the omissions were quite s significant as the hints and warnings and open admissions . There were many things they had quite definitely failed to talk of . Dave 's reason for trying to kill Bayard , for instance . Or why Hilary so hated the dead man . Evelyn or Janice had certainly been the last person to see Bayard alive . I could not believe that Janice ith her loveliness and her youth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to have a very urgent motive for murdering him ; it would have had to be a motive that even her gift for expediency and her extremely practical intelligence could discover no other possible way to satisfy . And while it 's true that a woman like Janice , passionately and hopelessly in love , may be impelled to do extraordinary things  --  till I do n't know that she need take to manslaughter s a relief for her feelings . But there was the time and opportunity Janice had ad  --  there was the egg basket and the revolver andhat compromising episode in the kitchen the very next 1 orning following the murder . There was no escapingthe deduction that she 'd known the revolver was in that basket and that she 'd gone to the refrigerator either to be sure it was still undetected or to remove it to a safer place . A dozen pictures of Janice returned to me : the frightened , beautiful girl in soft yellow chiffon , bravely holding her fright in leash and showing me into Bay . and Thatcher 's room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers , herself lovelier than any of them ; the tortured woman with the spent whits face leaving her love and her lover without surrender there at the foot of the stairs , with the still summer night and the moonlight and shadows and the scent of the roses outside . And there was her letter with its pride and pain and honesty . And there was the girl of the afternoon , happy and warm in spite of herself becauseAllen was there beside her , and holding that dark red rose to her cheek as if that were the one thing she might caress . No , it could n't be Janice . Yet Bayard Thatcher had certainly been murdered . I always came back to that . Twilight was coming on when I went downstairs . That night dinner was a silent and a rather dreadful meal . Those desperate efforts to keep up appearances had flagged from very weariness with the long and trying day , and I daresay everyone dreaded tomorrow'sordeal . Tomorrow , when they would lay Bayard'sbody away with those other Thatchers , and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small circle was that one who had murdered him . No , it was no pleasant thing to anticipate , and there was no escapingit . There were , even , no more telegrams to be opened and read and discussed with a determined pretenseof the ordinary and the commonplace . Flowers , however , had begun to come with the arrival of theP133veiling train ; they had been stored in tubs of cold water in the summer kitchen , but among them were ' lies whose cloying fragrance had filled the house beorethe sheaf was removed , and which now clung to everything , a ghostly notice of the ordeal to come . To my surprise Janice was white and tired and failedcatch the occasional effort Evelyn made to introducesome safe topic of conversation . The meal was half over before I discovered why ; somehow , I had petted her to be greatly relieved from alarm and anxiety by the return of her letter and to show it in her ace and bearing . But , possibly from not having had an verwhelming amount of experience in such matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her distressand anxiety as to who had read her letter would e greater than her relief at getting it into her own ands once again . After all , it might have been kinder  --  tell her . After dinner we sat out on the porch in the quiet , deepening summer night . There was very little said . he greens of the lawn lost themselves in shadow ; e cigarettes became small red spots of light ; the street lights away down at the corner made the trees om huge and black and far away , with leaves edged light silver where the light touched them . The moon me up finally ; the dusk was lost , and the shrubs and trees stood out black against the white lawn , and white trip of road . The moon , I thought idly , was at its full . After a long time Evelyn murmured somethingshout going home , and Adela stirred to say , out ofP134the darkness beside me , that she 'd like them to stay there again for the night . There was no appeal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Evelyn near her . Evelyn agreed at once . " Allen wo n't mind staying over at the house alone , " she said . " But I 'll want a few things from home . Allen , will you take the car over and ask Julia to pack my overnight bag . Tell her to put in that new white silk . The crepe with the long sleeves ; she 'll know the gown I mean . And the white hat that goes with it . And gloves . Tell her to fold the silk carefully , I do n't want to have to press it . We 'd better wear white tomorrow , Janice . Adela will wear black with her long crepe veil , but I think plain white summer dresses with white hats would be better for us to wear . People will like it . Do you mind , Allen ? " " I hope I get the right things , " said Allen , rising from the step . Against the moonlit lawn his tall figure looked strong and full of life and vitality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawn , and he said : " Better come along , Janice . The drive will do you good . " " Oh , no . No , " said Janice . There was a hint of panic in her voice . Of what had she been thinking , I wondered , as she sat there so quiet in the shadow of the clematis vine and watched Allen in the moonlight , and felt the soft summer night and wanted , perhaps , the touch of his hands and his arms and his mouth . Poor Janice , who knew so well what love could be . But perhapsAllen suffered more when he thought of Dave . Dave ! With some chagrin I reminded myself that myp135morals were tottering  --  morals which had served me well for longer than it 's necessary to mention . There was Dave , too , to be pitied ; Dave whose wife no longer loved him ; Dave whose friend was treacherous . Dave , who , by all rights , ought to be pitied more than any of them . But for the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps it was owing to his curious detachment , his enigmatic lack of interest in his lovely wife , his morose silences , his somber , withdrawnlook . Wearily I found myself again in that hopeless circle of speculation and resolved to leave it at least for the night . But I was not permitted to do so ; one of the strangest things about the Thatcher case was the inexorable destiny which dragged me into every phase of it . Evelyn , too , may have caught some meaning note in Janice 's voice , for she rose . " Perhaps I 'd better go along after all , " she said firmly . " We 'll be awfully hurried tomorrow morning , and I 'd better be sure I have everything . I 'll bring your things , too , Hilary . I think I know what you 'll want . " The sound of the car shook the still night . Janice had shrunk back into the shadow of the vine . " Such a few moments , " she had said , " out of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Adela stood . " I 'll say good-night , " she said . " As Evelyn says , we 'll be hurried in the morning . " She sighed . " I only hope no one says anything about our hurrying the fu- neral so . It does n't seem fitting not to wait  --  but tomorrow'sSunday  --  perhaps they 'll think " She checked herself and said in a more collected way , " Will you come with me , please , Miss Keate ? I am very tired . " I went with her , of course . She did look dreadfully weary . I was giving her a back massage when someoneknocked at the door . At Adela 's word Florrie entered . " Well , Florrie , what is it ? " asked Adela . " I 'm sorry to trouble you , Miss Adela , " said Florrie . " But I thought you might have some aspirin . I 've got one of my had headaches . And I do n't want to be sick for tomorrow , ma'am . There 'll be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florrie . There ought to be some in the medicine chest , there in my bathroom . Go and look . " But there was n't , it developed , and Adela sent Florrieto Janice 's room . " I 'm sure she has some . Just look in the medicine chest in her dressing room . She always keeps it on hand for Mr. Dave 's headaches . " Florrie went away . It was perhaps five minutes later that she returned . At first sight of her eyes , shining a little , and that odd look of malice in her usually stolid face , I straightened up and looked at the thing she held in her hands . It was a small white felt hat . Adela looked , too , and became an old , old woman before my very eyes . " I thought I ought to bring this to you , ma'am , " said Florrie , her voice shrill with a kind of ugly triumph.  | " I saw it accidentally . It was stuffed back of the radiatorin Miss Janice 's dressing room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have never before or since admired Adela as I did at that moment . She said : " Give it to me , Florrie . Miss Keate , have n't you some aspirin for her ? " I did have : a large boxful of tablets . A pasteboard box into which I had tumbled the tablets for convenience and which I had labeled . It was in my small instrument bag , and I got it at once and thrust box and all into Florrie 's hand and told her not to take too many of them . " You may go now , Florrie , " said Adela . Her bluish lips looked stiff , and her eyes like ice . The girl went ; she looked frightened . Adela did not try to dissemble before me . I suppose she knew it was no use . I looked at the small hat . It was the hat Janice had worn the previous afternoon ; I knew it at once . And I remembered with frightfulclarity that she had worn it when she entered the house alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And that when , at the alarm , she had appeared in the library beside us all she had worn no hat . But on the white brim of that small felt hat were four red-brown smudges . I have seen dried blood too often not to recognize it immediately . Adela said stiffly : " Take it . Nurse --  " And at that very instant there was a knock on thep138door , and without waiting for a reply it was pushed open . Janice stood on the threshold . Her dark eyes went to me and then to Adela and then fastened upon the hat . It was not nice to see the loveliness leave her face ; to see it become a stiff , strained white mask , hiding terror.  |p139MANY  times during my stay in the Thatcher home I was astonished at the Thatcher capacity for utter silence . Utter and complete silence at times when an ordinary person would have burst into frenzied explanations . But I was never more taken aback by that baffling trait than when Janice merely looked at that bloodstained little hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , and then said : " What are you doing with my hat ? " Her voice was quite steady , but then I had seen something of her powers of self-control . And her face was still white and drained of life . " Your  --  hat , " said Adela with difficulty . It was not exactly a question or a statement ; it was just the utteranceof words in a curiously tentative way . She offered , I thought , a chance for Janice to deny the hat . But Janice said , " Why , certainly . You know it 's my hat . ' What are you doing with it ? " " It was  --  found , " said Adela . She looked shrunken and terribly old . " It was found and brought to me . " " Who found it ? " " Florrie . " " Oh , " said Janice . " Oh . Florrie . Florrie seems to be taking quite an interest in my affairs lately . Well , if you are quite through with it , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed and picked up the hat . I noted that her slender fingers seemed to avoid touching the brim ; that brim that showed where four fingers had touched it and had left so ugly a mark ( if their pressure . To complete my bewilderment she bent over Adela , kissed her cheek lightly , said , " Have a good night , darling . Do n't worry about tomorrow , " and turned away . At the door she remembered my presence and said over her shoulder , " Good-night , Miss Keate . " She said it coolly , her dark eyes unfathomable , her slender figure erect , her chin up , and the tell-tale little hat crushed in her hand . Then she closed the door firmly behind her , and Adela sighed . " You see , Miss Keate , we were wrong . We both leaped to an unjust and horrible conclusion . Or not so much a conclusion as a very dreadful suspicion . It only goes to show how one 's nerves may trick one . We are both unstrung by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was killed by a burglar , and we know it . And yet merely the sight of  --  the sight of " She could not say the word and substituted , " merely the stain on Janice 's hat made us bothfear " Deep waters here , Adela . And she realizedit . For she checked her words to cough delicately , to hunt for a handkerchief , to ask me for a drink of water . And finally to resume : " Absurd of us . When there are so many ways that could happen . Of course . I know my own family . I know none of them are capable of  --  that Janice is not  --  that she could not " She stuck again . Poorp141Adela , she could not bring herself to voice her thought . As for me , I should have been much happier if Janice had said something  --  anything  --  to explain that hat . Her silence was almost as damning as the bloody fingerprints ; more so , in fact , for I felt if there 'd been an innocent explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incident brought rather forcibly to my mind the danger in which I stood . I , the stranger ; I , the outsider . I said quietly : " By the way , Miss Thatcher , you wo n't need me past tomorrow . I can return to the hospital after the funeral . " Even if I did not know what I knew , I would have guessed something of it from the sudden bleakness of her blue eyes , the way her face set itself again . " Oh , certainly , Miss Keate , " she said . " Certainly . I did n't realize that I was keeping you here when there was something else you were anxious to do . Is there a case waiting for you ? " " No , " I said honestly . " But I must  --  go . " " Oh , then , " she said affably , " if there 's no case waiting for you , you wo n't mind staying with me a few ( lays longer . Surely you do n't feel that we expect too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , really , to tell you how grateful we all are for the way you 've helped us . I do n't know what we should have done without you . But I 'm sorry we have worked you too hard . " " Oh , no , " I said helplessly . " Not too hard . But you do n't need my nursing care , you know , and --  " My dear , you are too conscientious , " said Adela pleasantly . " I see what 's wrong . You like to be busy ,  | and you feel you are n't doing enough . Well , then , I must tell you that we  --  we depend upon you . Of course , if you do n't like it with us , I will not try to keep you . But I  --  I 'm not in very good health , as you surely have seen . And you ca n't possibly realize what a help you 've been to me . But do n't let me persuade you . I can probably get along . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dreadful shock " Her voice broke . That much was true , and I knew it ; I even wondered how long she could endure the dreadful strain put upon her . Afterward I reflected that she had very cleverly used the only weapon that would touch me ; opposition I could have resisted , defencelessness weakened my resolution . And at the time I felt no definite , physical fear of any one member of the Thatcher family ; it was only a kind of grim uneasiness , a feeling of uncertainty that clutched rather coldly at my heart now and then and was immediately dispelled at the sound of Adela 's calm , deliberately elegant voice . " Never mind , now , " I said . " You must get some sleep . I 'll not leave for a day or two , at any rate . Now then , I 'll just give you something Dr. Bouligny left to make you sleep . You must have a good night 's rest . " Wisely she left the matter of my departure rest . Adela was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't like drugs , " she said sharply . " I never feel well the morning after I take a sedative . And besides , I  --  well , I do n't like them . I hate drugs . Dr. Bouligny is too free with them . I 'll do better not to take any tonight , Miss Ideate . Just hand me those turquoise beads , will you ? I like to Thank you . I 've had these manyp143years . It always calms me a little to feel them in my hands . But you might read aloud to me a little , if you will , Miss Keate . Reading aloud is very soothing , I think . There are some books on that shelf back of you . Choose what you like . " There was n't much choice : from a history of the Thatcher Family , a volume of Drummond 's sermons , and The Last of the Mohicans , I chose the latter as being livelier and reflected inwardly that whoever of the Thatchers had collected that splendid library downstairsit was not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savage forest failed to charm , and though I read steadily and stubbornly onward I found my thoughts holding to the Thatcher problem to such a degree that once I read Janice instead of Alice and another time found I had skipped an entire page  --  and an important page , which left Cora at the river 's brim in very equivocal circumstances indeed . But Adela did not note my slight lapses ; she lay there staring at the ceiling , pulling her turquoise beads through her fingers , thinking , I felt , rather desperately while I tried to retrieve my errors by reading with increased expression and feeling . Finally she said to me : " I 've been thinking about Florrie , Miss Keate . You may stop reading ; yes , thank you , that was very nice , I 'm sure . Very soothing , " she said with a politeness which , I must say , left me a bit dashed ; I have always felt that I read aloud rather well  --  particularly the more dramatic portions . " You see , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that hat.  |p144Janice  's hat , you know . And Florrie is a very stupid girl and a talkative one . If she gets some silly notion in her head , it will go straight to her mother , and the whole town will know it in half a day . I think I 'd betterspeak to Florrie at once . Tell her  --  something ; anything to hold her tongue . I shall rest better when I 've done so . Would you call her , Miss Keate ? I daresay everyone else has gone to bed . It 's been very quiet in the house for some time . Florrie is probably asleep by this time . But I think you 'd better wake her . " " Very well . " I replaced the book on the shelf . It had grown very quiet as I read ; the moonlight was white and still on the lawns outside the windows and the great trees hushed and black . " Where is her room ? " " On the third floor . At the back of the hall is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on the east side of the third-floor hall ; the gable room . You can find it without any difficulty . Do n't be long , Miss Keate . I feel  --  a little nervous , somehow , uneasy . I 'm sure I 'll feel better after I 've talked to Florrie . " The wide hall was quiet , deserted . The night light only faintly illuminated its dim length . The rest of the household had apparently gone to sleep , for there was no sound of voices or motion in the whole house . The silence was so deep that , when I passed the stair well , I could actually hear the great clock ticking slowly and deliberately downstairs . I walked rather quickly down the hall , past all those closed doors . Sure enough , at its end , running up a few steps to a sharp landing at right angles to the hall , I found the stair/way leading to the third floor . At the same angle were other stairs leading down to , presumably , the back part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back stairway was almost of itself an evidence of gentility . Something about the sleeping house and the quiet shadowy hall made me , too , feel uneasy . And an unkindtrick of memory brought to me suddenly a mental vision of Bayard Thatcher  --  Bayard Thatcher , shatteredand dead on the library rug . The silent house knew and held the secret of his death . I settled my cap and went up the stairs , feeling my way along by clinging to the railing until I emerged upon a narrow passage at the top along which white fingers of moonlight stretched ghostly . I had no difficulty following Adela 's directions . The door that must be Florrie 's was closed , and I knocked and knocked again . There was no answer . The moonlight was white on the floor . The whole place was silent . There was not a breath of sound anywhere . I knocked once more ; louder this time , and wishing myself back in Adela 's softly lit room . Or , better , my own room , with the door locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she always locked her door ? She 'd said other things , too . Silly things . Absurd things . " Florrie , " I called . My voice was not too steady . said more clearly , " Florrie . Miss Thatcher wants you . " There was still no reply . I think it was the complete deathlike silence that frightened me , rather than the memory of her stolid ,  | foolish voice saying , " murdered in my sleep  --  murderedin my sleep . " But whatever it was I was suddenly in a panic . She ought to answer . She ought to come to open the door . My last knock resounded in the still passage . All at once I was trembling . My hands were shakingas I tried the door , pushed against it , and rattled the doorknob . It was locked , and there was still no sound from the girl inside . Then , quite as if my body were acting of itself , involuntarily , without my consent or council , I was flying down that narrow stairway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn and down the long hall . I 'm sure I did n't cry out , but perhaps my footstepsroused the uneasy house . From some desire to save Adela I found myself at Janice 's door rather than at Adela 's , knocking and sobbing out something . She flung open the door , her face as white as her nightdress . " What is it ? Miss Keate " " The keys , " I said . " Florrie . Something 's wrong . We 'll need the key to her room . " She did not stop to question me . She snatched a negligeefrom a chair . " Adela 's got the keys . I 'll go We were in Adela 's room , meeting her shocked eyes , grasping the keys . We were running along the hall again . Hilary , in purple-striped pajamas , bounced out of a door as we passed , panted something I did n't hear , and followed . I was vaguely conscious that Evelyn was there , too , for I remember her long yellowp147braids swinging beside me as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some trouble getting it to turn . Florrie'skey had been left in the other side , and it was Hilary who finally managed it . By that time Emmelinewas in the hall , too : a bizarre figure in a bright Japanese crepe kimono and her hair in curlers . But we did get the door unlocked . I was the first one through it . The moonlight streamed whitely into the room . It was so radiant and bright that the figure of the girl on the bed was very clear . There was a sort of hush back of me . Then Hilary said in a high , squeaky voice : " Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! The girl 's dead ! " Well , she was n't dead . She was and is still , so far as I know , alive . But she was as near death as are few people in this world who yet live . She was already in that vast shadowy borderlandwhence there are so few returns . We were barely in time . I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to life . But I was trained . I knew what to do . I knew what , after hunting for that feeble flicker that was her pulse , to look for . And I found it on the table beside her . The box of aspirin tablets I had given her stood there . It was open . But the tablets were not aspirin . I looked , tasted . " Make some strong black coffee as quick as you can . Call the doctor . Help me get her out of bed . On her feet . The girl 's nearly dead with veronal . " How we worked , Evelyn and Janice and I , with Hilary hurrying to the telephone , and Emmeline to the kitchen for coffee , and Adela panting upstairs to get us cold towels and watch us with blank blue eyes while we walked that inert burden up and down , up and down , holding her sliding weight somehow between us . Hilary was back soon , puffing from the climb , telling us to do what we were already doing and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how haggard and old he looked , huddled in a shabby old dressing gown , his hair rumpled and untidy ; Hilary , whose finical tidiness often reminded me of a sleek cat . We worked furiously ; well-nigh frantically . The night was warm and our faces glistened . It took supremephysical exertion to keep the girl moving . It was dreadfully difficult to force the coffee down her throat , and for a long time after that the aroma of strong black coffee made me feel ill and faint . I was only barely conscious of Dr. Bouligny 's arrival , and of the hidden horror back of Adela 's bleak blue eyes when she told him as far as she could what had happened . But we did save the girl . Although I suppose only I and the doctor knew how narrowly we had saved her . It was approaching dawn when Dr. Bouligny said , " She 'll do now , " and sent Janice and Evelyn away to get some rest . Adela he had sent back to bed long ago , and Hilary had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which he watched us with weary , troubled eyes . " Miss Keate has worked harder than anybody , " said Janice . " I 'm not tired . Let her go and get some sleep , and I 'll stay with Florrie. "  | " You 'll have to go to the funeral , " said Dr. Boulignybrusquely . " Miss Keate can rest later in the day . Go along , child , and try to sleep some . You look as if you 're about to drop . Now then , Miss Keate  --  you 'd better stay a moment , Hilary  --  how did you happen to give this girl veronal ? " " But I did n't , " I said . " I did n't have any veronal . " " This is the box you gave Florrie , is n't it ? Adela said it was . And it 's your handwriting on the label . It says aspirin , but --  " Oh , that 's the box I gave her , " I said sharply . " Of course it is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And there was aspirin in the box . I could not make such a mistake . There are a hundred ways I can prove it . " " But there are veronal tablets in it now , " persisted Dr. Bouligny . " Come , Miss Keate . If you made a mistake , I know it was an accident , and no one regrets it more than you . I also know that you do n't as a rule  --  in fact , I feel confident that you almost never make a mistake . And since we have saved the girl , there 's no irreparable harm done . " " But I tell you I did not put veronal tablets in that box ! " " Now , Miss Keate , " said Hilary anxiously , " do n't get all upset about this . Nobody 's blaming you . But do n't you see the tablets  --  the veronal tablets , I mean  --  are in it now ? When did you last open that pill box ? " " The day before I came here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it in my instrument bag . Nobody could ever confuse aspirin tablets and veronalp150tablets . And I did n't touch it again until Florrie asked for aspirin last night and I took the box out and handed it to her . If veronal is there now instead of aspirin , as it is , somebody in this house put it there . " " Nonsense , Miss Keate 1 Why should anyone do that ? I hope you are n't suggesting that someone tried to --  -- to kill Florrie . That is n't reasonable . Aside from the fact that no one in the house  --  oh , it 's quite absurd even to consider id  --  had any reason to kill Florrie , nobody could have known ahead of time that she would have a headache and would n't be able to find as commona thing as aspirin anywhere in the house and would finally come to you for it and get the veronal instead . And that she would take enough of it to kill her . Really , Miss Keate , that 's going too far 1 " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink and his eyes ugly . " Keep your temper , Hilary , " said Dr. Bouligny quickly . " Do n't get excited like that . Miss Keate does n't think anyone tried to kill Florrie with veronal . That would be altogether too far-fetched . But , Miss Keate , who has had access to your instrument bag ? " " Everyone in the house , I imagine . I left it in the bathroom off Bayard Thatcher 's room until I was asked to care for Miss Thatcher , immediately after his death . Then I went into his room and got the bag and left it in the bathroom adjoining Miss Thatcher 's room . " " Was that entirely safe ? " asked Hilary unpleasantly . " Safe ! I do n't see why not ! There 's nothing in itp151but dressings , bandage scissors , thermometers , a bottle of alcohol , a rubber sheet " There , there , now , Miss Keate . Mr. Thatcher is n't accusing you of carelessness . Your own accusation that someone in this house removed the harmless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious . lave you any real reason to suspect your instrument bag has been tampered with ? " " Yes . " " What 's that ? What do you mean ? " cried Hilary . " I  --  it was  --  well , I know someone  --  tampered with t . " Who ? How do you know ? " " I found something in it . Something  --  unimportant . 1 restored it to its owner . " Hilary was leaning forward ; his face faintly purple . " You 'll have to explain yourself , Miss Keate . You ave said too much not to say more . " " I 'll do no such thing . That had nothing to do with e veronal . As a matter of fact , every single one of u had access to it . And your own sister suggested at I give Florrie aspirin . " " My sister ! Janice ? " " No . " " Adela ! Good God , Miss Keate , you are out of your uses . " Hilary had leaped to his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do you hear her , an ? She 's out of her senses . She 's a dangerous Oman . She ought to be removed . Put where she ca n't o any damage . Adela ! She says Adela gave Florrie veronal . "  | " I said nothing of the kind , " I cried , shocked . " 1 meant nothing of the kind . I said she suggested I give Florrie veronal  --  I mean , aspirin  --  and I did . I wanted you to understand that I did n't offer it to her voluntarily . I had nothing at all to do with it . Somebody here put veronal in that box . I did n't . And I 'll notaccused of it . " " There now , Miss Keate , " said Dr. Bouligny heavily . " Do cool down , Hilary . You ought not permit yourself to get in such rages . " " Not permit myself , " spluttered Hilary , quite besidehimself . " When she sits and looks at me like that . I 'll not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , I do n't see how you are going to help it , " said Dr. Bouligny rather wearily . " What was it you found in your instrument bag , Miss Keate ? To whom did you return it ? " That took the wind out of my sails ; it is very difficult for a nurse of many years ' experience to refuse to answer a doctor 's question . I looked past the narrow bed where Florrie lay , her face more natural , her breath coming and going heavily , out through the gable window . Dawn was touching the treetops with gold , and I thought of the other two dawns I had seen in that house . A cool breath of morningair billowed the ruffled curtain and touched my hot , tired face . It had been a dreadful night , a night to sap one 's energies , to test one 's stamina , to try one 's courage to the utmost . Dr. Bouligny was watching me anxiously , his heavy hand rubbing his dark , unshaven chin . Hilary wasp153breathing heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wary . " Come , Miss Keate , " urged Dr. Bouligny . " Who %vas it ? " " What does it matter ? " I said wearily . " We 've saved the girl . That 's the main thing . " " What was it you found in your bag ? Tell us at once . " Hilary 's voice was sharply commanding . It an- ' noyed me . " I prefer , " I said loftily , " not to tell . It was nothing that could have any connection at all with this . I returnedit to the owner , and even the owner does not know I saw  --  found it . I 'm sorry I spoke of it . I only did so to prove that my instrument bag was quite accessibleto other people besides myself . I refuse to say any more . If I were questioned in a court of law , of course Hilary 's face flushed darker . " You 'd tell , then , I do n't doubt , " he said nastily . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . Not this trouble with Florrie . And as for anything else youay know about our family affairs , nurse , you aren'toing to have a chance to tell that in a court of law ither . You can be sure of that . " " Hilary , " said Dr. Bouligny in some exasperation , " I 'll swear you go out of your way to be a plain damn fool . Your temper and your tongue are going to get ou into bad trouble some day , if they have n't already. a n't you see that you are alienating " I did n't see that Dr. Bouligny was making matters ny better . Perhaps it was fortunate that Janice inter- rupted just when she did . She said , " Hilary , " and we all turned and saw her in the doorway . I wondered how long she 'd been standing there . I could tell nothing from her steady dark eyes and her white face . " Adela wants you , " she went on . " You , too , Dr. Dan . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to sleep . She 's determined to go through with the funeral . It 's morning . You 'd better go to her at once . " The two men pulled themselves to their feet . Dr. Bouligny murmured a direction or two about Florrie and said he 'd be back later in the day , and not to let her get pneumonia . He did have the grace to add a sort of apology about overworking me and that it was fortunate I was there and had known what to do for the girl . Hilary said nothing . I could hear the muffled sound of their voices as they went down the narrow stairway , and I caught the words " dangerous enemy " in Hilary 's voice . I had no doubt he referred to me . Janice had walked to the window and was standing there , her back to me . There was a long moment of silence with the sound of the descending footsteps of the men growing fainter . It was a peaceful silence , with the cool summer dawn filling the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Janice 's voice , when it came , was calm too , but it was the calm of great weariness and of final surrender . She said : " So you knew about the letter . My letter . "  |p155ThE  unconscious girl on the bed moaned stupidly , and I went to her . Presently I said : " And you returned it to me ? Placed it there on my desk ? " " Yes . " " It was  --  you found it there in your instrument bag ? " " Yes . " " And  --  read it ? " There was pain in the reluctant question , pain and pride . Janice could always face things . She was standing quiet ; her dark hair hung down her back like a child 's  --  it was not long and ite nded in a soft , dark confusion of loose curls . Thedressing gown she wore , the pale yellow chiffon inwhich I had first seen her , fell softly about her slenderyoung figure . I longed to say I had not read the letcr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did n't tell . You did n't tell . " " No . I 've never felt that duty demands a free tongue . " " Then you do n't think  --  you do n't think I'mhe stopped . It was a moment before I realized shep156was trying to keep back sobs . The night we had had was enough to break even Janice 's steel-like self-control ; I did not think the less of her . " No , " I said . " No , I do n't think anything , you poor child ! " She turned then , very slowly , tears in her dark eyes and on her soft cheeks . I squirmed . I do n't like tears , and besides , there was a lump in my throat that hurt . I said : " We are both exhausted after such a night . Sit down and we 'll talk quietly . I 've had enough of emotionsfor one night . " She gave me a long look . " No , " she said . " I 've said enough . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good of you not to tell . I 'm trying , you see , to do what I think is right . But I 'd better tell you . You see , I had written that letter to explain to Allen how I felt . It was so difficult to tell him . And Bayard found the letter . Took the letter , rather ; saw me place it in the pocket of Allen 's coat and deliberately took it . Somehow , though , he had managed to get only the second sheet of it  --  but that was enough . And Bayard  --  I wonder what you know of Bayard , Miss Keate . He was  --  he was --  " Predatory , " I said out of my memory . She looked at me with surprise . " I do n't know how you knew that , " she said , " but it is true . Terribly true . You see , Bayard  --  it 's hard to tell it , Miss Keate . " " Blackmailed you , I suppose . Or tried to . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He threatened to tellp157Dave . Adela . Evelyn and Hilary . By that time everyonewould have known it . Oh  --  I ca n't tell you how awful it would have been . " She covered her face with her hands . " I can imagine it would have been very bad , " I said . " It would have broken Adela 's heart . " " Then I suppose Bayard put that letter in my bag ? " " I suppose so . " She looked at me with wide eyes . " We would n't give him what he wanted . I could n't . I have no money of my own . Allen would n't . He said Bayard had been bleeding this family for years . He told me not to worry . That he 'd find a way out of it . That he was n't afraid of Bayard . But  --  it 's been terrible , Miss Ideate . Bayard goaded us . Hinted at things . I was always conscious of it . He would n't let me forget for a moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " her voice sank to a whisper  --  " I 'm glad he 's dead . I am . I 'm glad he 's dead . " So that was why Allen had searched the dead man 's pockets so feverishly . But did Janice realize what she was telling me ? That she and Allen both had the strongest of motives for wishing Bayard Thatcher out of the way ? But Allen had an alibi ; he had been with Dave the entire afternoon . " Yes , " she said thoughtfully . " I suppose Bayard hid the letter in your bag . He 'd have thought there was no danger of its being found . He knew , of course , that Allen and I would do our utmost to recover it . He must have been afraid Allen would search his things while he was ill . "   " My dear , " I said gently . " Why did Dave shoot Bayard ? " She shrank back against the window . " Shoot Bayard ! Then you knew ? " " Yes . And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got there in time to keep Dave from shooting again . " The color came slowly back to her lips . " I do n't know , " she said soberly . " I 'm not sure . But it had nothing to do with my letter ; I 'm sure of that . Dave would have told me ; confronted me with it . Dave 's been terribly depressed since Bayard 's death  --  and before that . He is n't like himself at all since he 's been sick so much . " " Janice . " It was Evelyn from the doorway . " Oh , there you are . Emmeline has made some coffee for us . You 'd better come down and drink some and then try to rest . We 've got so much to do today . Miss Keate , I 'll send some coffee up here to you . " " No , " I said hurriedly . " Let me have a glass of warm milk . I do n't want coffee . " I shuddered as I glanced at Florrie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course , " said Evelyn , blissfully matter-of-fact . " Come , Janice . You look dreadfully tired . " At the door Janice hesitated , and as Evelyn preceded her into the passage she came back , paused beside me , and said , " Thank you , " in a low voice and was gone . I knew she was not thanking me for concealing the matterof the letter . But the sound of their light footsteps had not moreP159than died away before I was in a very turmoil of conflictingemotions and desires again . Why had I not asked her about all those things which gave such hideouswitness against her ? Why had I not at least asked her about the bloodstained hat ? Florrie moved , and I went to take her pulse . Feeling for the throb , I thought impatiently that after all I could have done no more than I did . It is extraordinarilydifcult  --  indeed , it is quite impossible to approach a lovely young woman and say to her , " My dear young lady , this is all very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I could n't have done that . But I felt rather sick as I thought of the accumulating evidence against her . And then there was the inexplicable matter of the veronal tablets . The box was still there on the table , and I looked at it , considering . The whole affair seemed an extraordinarily purposeless thing . It was against reason to think that Florrie had been the victimof a real and intentionally murderous attack ; as Hilary had pointed out , no one could have known in advance that she would have a headache , want aspirin , and be unable to secure any of it anywhere else in the house and would come to me . I believe I felt from the first that the veronal had been placed in that box for quite another purpose  --  what it was I could n't guess  --  and that Florrie 's taking it and coming so near death was only an unlucky and nearly fatal accident . The significant thing was the fact of the veronal having been brought to the house by someone and that curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouldP160have given me a clue to the whole situation , and I suppose it did , after a fashion . But aftersight is always better than foresight . Veronal , I might add , is not from a nurse 's viewpointexactly a dangerous drug . It may , of course , be taken to excess , when it is promptly fatal . It is a hypnotic , used a great deal for insomnia . It is true that once in a while some poor soul becomes an addict to the drug , takes it as a habit , becomes firmly and terriblyattached to it , but even this may be taken in time and cured . In many states the sale of veronal except by doctor 's prescription is prohibited , and this being the case in our own state increased the complexity of the matter . Someone in that house evidently had access to fairly large quantities of the drug . It is needless to say that I revolved the matter at length in my mind , and that by noon I had , I daresay , a hundred explanations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quiet day , that Sunday , with the slow , melodious sound of church bells coming clearly and frequently to my ears . C is not a large town , but it has five churches . Sunday , I learned , is a favorite day for funerals , owing to the farmers and shopkeepers being at leisure ; not , in other words , having anything else to do and rather welcoming the diversion . Thus burying Bayard on that day was considered in all quartersthe proper and fitting thing to do and did not in the least savor of unseemly and suspicious haste . I spent most of the day in the small room with Florrie , the open gable window letting in the soft summerair and sunlight and sound of church bells and thep161girl slowly recovering . I saw little of the funeral , for which I was not sorry . Only a few subdued sounds of people arriving and the heavy scents of flowers and the murmur of a hymn or two reached us there on the third floor . And when I slipped downstairs about eleven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the only reminders of what had taken place were the stacks of chairs folded on the porch and waiting to be taken away , the heavy , cloying odor of flowers , and the heap of cards from the flowers with their white ribbons still clinging to them which was on Adela 's desk . Janice and Evelyn were rearranging furniture which had been pushed out of place in the wide drawingrooms , and Adela was conferring with Emmeline in the morning room . It always rather pleased me , somehow , to note how competent all the Thatcher women were about managinga house . They seemed to know certain things by instinct and the machinery ran smoothly and unobtrusively . There were always generosity and solid plenty , but never lavishness and waste . After all , there is a certaindignity about thrift and the caring for things , of which we see too little , and there is an extremely pleasantand fine dignity about a well cared for house . There were even , I learned , certain traditions : several times I heard echoes of " Evelyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and it appeared that only Adela could mend lace or table linen and that Janice could make flowers grow . " Roses , " I have heard Adela say in her bland , assured way , " either grow for you or do n't grow . But they grow for Janice . She has a magic touch with flowers . " All graces of which one hears very little now ; still , they are lovely and serene . To my disappointment my box of fresh uniforms had still not arrived , and I was obliged to continue wearing the limp and wrinkled white dress which had seen me through that hot night . I wrote a hurried note to the hospital , sealed and stamped it , and left it with some other outgoing mail on the hall table . At lunch I caught a glimpse of the family , although it was an unusually hurried meal , with Hilary arriving with the city newspapers  --  which , since nothing had , happened that summer but a drought , were inclined to play up the story of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " of the Thatcher County Thatchers , " said the newspaper I saw , " the prominent pioneer family of a name which has long been of importance in the state  --  and Jirn Strove , the sheriff , and Dr. Bouligny arriving before the meal was quite over . Strove came to say apologeticallythat he had three suspects in the county jail and would Hilary come down and question them ; he asked Adela to forgive him for troubling them on Sunday , seemed a little discouraged and doubtful , but did not have the air of a conspirator ; from which I judged that Hilary had dealt with him rather adroitly . And Dr. Bouligny came to see how our patient was progressing . I accompanied him , of course , to Florrie 's room . As we passed the hall table , something about my note , which lay face downward on top , caught my eye . Ip163do n't yet know exactly what it was , but I picked up the note and looked sharply at it . I have good eyes and a good nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envelope had been opened and then pasted down again with library paste . It chilled me . There was nothing in the note that anyone might not read , but it was difficult to associate letter-opening with the Thatchers . Looking back , I can see that with Florrie 's unlucky accident the net of suave surveillance to which I was subjected became really definite and tight . But it was drawn so deftly that it actually seemed that the Thatcher family had only become very graciously and cordially disposed toward me . If I had a letter to post , someone offered to post it for me ; if I had an errand to town , someone offered to do it for me ; if I went for a walk , someone either offered to go along or turned up somewhere along my way . They were friendly , bland , and unrelenting . Florrie was much better ; her recovery was only a matter of time and care in order to avoid veronal pneumonia . That day she was well enough to permit me to nap on a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hilary , red and puffing and reluctant , carried up the narrow stairway and placed in Florrie 's room for me . I think Hilary would as soon I 'd have gone without that small attention . But the day was quiet . I suppose the Thatchers thought I was quite safe . Evelyn came up about five to say she would stay with Florrie while I got some fresh air . It was likep16IEvelyn to think of that , even in the midst of her grave anxiety , and I accepted her offer readily . She looked tired , of course , with the strain of the ghastly night and trying day  --  tired and anxious . Her color was bad , sallow and dark , and there were brown hollows around her eyes . She would lie on the day bed and rest , she said , and told me not to hurry . As I left I glanced at the table to see that everything was there that Florrie might need . I 'm sure the box which held the veronal tablets was on the table then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to have taken them away with him , and that I must remind him the next call he made . The thought of the tablets ' being a danger did not , I 'm sure , after all that had happened , occur to me ; if it had , I would have taken them in my own charge . It was accident , as much as anything , that took me to the family cemetery . I 'm sure it was accident that permittedme to leave the house unobserved and unaccompanied ; perhaps Evelyn had not told the others that she intended to relieve me . I walked first through the garden , then along a path back of the house and past a large vegetable garden . This was enclosed at the back by a high lattice fence , painted green , with a door through which I walked and found a well defined path leading across a meadow , over a small bridge , up and across a low , rolling hill , plentifully wooded with old oak trees , and thence , before I knew it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the family burial plot which had existed earlier , I imagine , than the town itself , andp165where , by some manipulating probably of property lines and county politics , the Thatchers were still buried . It was not a large place , with its old iron fence and gate , its black cedars , its small old headstones and neatly tended graves . I wandered about for some time looking at the quaint epitaphs on some of the older stones , and finally brought up back of a thick cluster of cedars at the new grave . I was standing there , staring at the wilting wreaths of flowers and thinking of Bayard 's death and feeling , I must admit , extremely depressed and uneasy , when I heard the click of the gate . I looked through the thick cedar boughs , not realizing that , even in my white dress , I was likely quite invisible to the person entering the gate . The person was Dave . Dave in a light suit that made him look thin , and his hat pulled low over his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly and with a curiously uncertaingait , as if his muscles did not coordinate perfectly , toward me . Or rather toward the cedars behind which I stood . Was he coming to mourn at the grave of the man he had so nearly killed ? I do n't know exactly what impulse impelled me rather hurriedly away from those wilting flowers and toward another grave , an old one just opposite . But I went , and in another moment met Dave face to face . And he looked startled and frightened as he rounded the clump of cedars and saw me . " Why  --  it 's you , Miss Keate ! " His voice was notp166very steady . He took off his hat and passed his hand across his forehead and said , " I did n't see you at first  --  your white dress  --  you gave me rather a shock . I 've been having a little trouble with my eyes . Silly of me " I was walking , " I said . " And I happened to walk this way . What an interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't it ? " " I believe so . Did you read some of the epitaphs ? The Thatchers all seemed very sure of going to their rewards . The family has always kept the place up . It 's one of the spots of historical interest in the state . At least , frenzied females with notebooks and cameras come every so often to look at it . Adela gives them tea and shows them the family portraits and thoroughly enjoys herself . " " Indeed , " I said , and found myself reading the words on the headstone beside us . " Nita Thatcher " was distinctly carved on the old stone . Nita Thatcher . In a fraction of an instant I had traced its familiarity . Bayard had said in his sleep , " Nita 's grave . " The thought flashed through my mind that here at last I might have stumbled on the solution to the , puzzle . I was sure Bayard had said , " Nita 's grave . " Was there here some buried story , buried but not well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re  --  venge , even contested wills surged swiftly and rather wildly through my mind , and I bent forward to look at the stone . Below the name were dates , and they were rather conclusive : 1839  --  1881 . She had died , hadp167Nita Thatcher , long before Bayard or Dave was born . In some bewilderment I drew back . And became aware of the sudden dark suspicion in Dave 's face . " What are you doing here ? " he demanded in such sudden and sullen fury that I was struck quite dumb with astonishment . " Why have you come here ? See here , Nurse  --  you 'll be wise not to interfere with things that are no concern of yours . Remember that . " He turned and walked away and was out the gate and disappearing over the brow of the hill before I struggled out of the fog of a bewilderment induced asmuch by his sudden and irrational rage as by thatsingular matter of Nita Thatcher 's grave . For it had certainly been Nita 's grave Bayard had mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if t were his destination and purpose in coming to the cemetery . I went very thoughtfully back to the house . Evelyn inquired politely about my walk , made a few obvious comments about the weather and about Florrie , and left . It did not improve my spirits to discover that she had taken the box of remaining ronal tablets away with her . At least , when I wenthand Florrie a glass of water from the table , the x was indisputably gone . Florrie , on being questioned , said she 'd been drowsy but was sure only Miss Evelyn had been in the room during my absence . Well , the veronal was safe anywhere it was safe with Evelyn , I told myself , but a nagging little worry perstetin the back of my mind , and it began to seem to e that I 'd been criminally careless about the tablets.  |p168And  yet  --  veronal is not like poison or some really dangerous drug . About nine o'clock that night Adela came up , lookingvery weary but still faintly bland , and panting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How is your patient , Miss Keate ? " she asked . " Better , I hope . You are better , are n't you , Florrie ? You gave us quite a fright . " " I 'm all right , " said Florrie rather weakly . " Miss Evelyn told me all about what happened . I do n't supposeanybody meant to give me the wrong stuff . " She glanced at me rather doubtfully but continued : " Miss Evelyn said I owed my life to the nurse . I suppose I do . But I ought to have known not to take the pills . A red-haired woman and the moon at its full and something out of a -- Adela thought she was still only half-conscious . She bent over the bed . " There now , Florrie . Try to get some rest and natural sleep . Dr. Bouligny says you are going to be all right . Is n't it fine that Miss Keate was here and knew just what to do for you ? " Florrie looked at me again ; it was a curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , yes , " she said . " But I ought to have known better than to take them . But I guess she did n't mean to do it . " " Why , of course she did n't mean to do it . It was a very terrible accident , but you are going to be all right now . Miss Keate will stay here and take care of you and  | " I think I 'd be better off alone , ma'am , if you do n't mind . " " Alone ! Oh , no , Florrie , Dr. Bouligny says it 's best for Miss Keate to stay with you , and I think she 's very kind to do it . " " Yes , " muttered Florrie . " But there 's a full moon tonight . " Adela looked perplexed . " Florrie , you are n't yourself yet . But do n't worry : you 'll be all right if you do just as the doctor says . Will you be comfortable , Miss Keate ? Is there anything you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you . If you had n't been here last night " Herface was hard all at once , touched with granite . She went on : " Do n't hesitate to ask Emmeline to help you or get anything you want . Good-night . " Her silk skirts swished delicately on the stairs . Florrie sighed . " I do n't think you really meant to give me those tablets , Miss Keate , " she said forgivingly . " You 've been awful good to me today . I guess you did n't mean to . Miss Evelyn said I 'd have died sure if you had n't known what to do for me . " I could see no good purpose in telling Florrie anythingof the mystery of the veronal tablets . I said : " That 's good . Now I 'll just fluff up your pillows , and you try to sleep . " " Say , Miss Keate , did they have the funeral today ? " " Yes . " " Was it a big one ? " " I do n't know ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there , and while she did n't rememberexactly the entire collection of diamonds , she thought they were all there . Or most of them . " It was a good place to hide them , " she said ruminatively . " The bath salts are sort of shiny ; it was just the light catching one of the diamonds that made me look . But I did n't say anything to anybody . I wanted to keep out of it . And I knew they were safe there because Miss Janice hates bath salts and never uses them . She says she just keeps the jar there for the color scheme . Did you ever see her bathroom , Miss Keate ? She 's got water lilies painted all around the walls . And little green frogs . Heathenish , I say . " " Are they still there ? " " Oh , sure . They 're painted . " " The diamonds , I mean . " She looked evasive . " The last time I looked they were , " she said . " Say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got those tablets  --  veronal ? is that what you call them ? " " I do n't know how it happened , Florrie . Why did you think she might have  --  managed it ? " " She do n't like me , " said Florrie , still evasive . " She threatened me just yesterday . " " Threatened you ! " " Well , she said I 'd regret something I did . And I got those tablets right afterward and nearly died . " I suppressed a smile at the thought of the salutary effect of Janice 's rebuke . Whatever Florrie 's conclusionregarding the veronal tablets came to be , I thought it highly unlikely she would ever do any morep173prowling among Janice 's things . Then another thought struck me : " Florrie , think now and answer carefully . Did you leave that box of tablets anywhere in the house before you took them ? Did you put it down on a table ? Or anywhere ? Was the box out of your possession even for a moment ? " " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , Miss Keate . I took the box from you and came straight up here to my room and took the first two tablets before I even undressed . Then my head was no better , so I kept on taking them . " " How many did you take altogether ? " I asked , and when she told me I shuddered . " But did n't you see they were not aspirin ? They are much larger , for one thing . " " Why , no , " she said . " Coming from a hospital , I expected them to be a little different from regular aspirin . Hospitals are such queer places . Do you know what people are saying about who killed Bayard ? " " No . You 'd better go to sleep , Florrie . " " I do n't know either . But they 'll say Hilary killed him . You see if I 'm not right . Hilary and Bayard never liked each other . " " Florrie , do you know anything about a Nita " Thatcher ? Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave ? " " No , " she said after a thoughtful moment . " There 's a grave up at the Thatcher cemetery marked Nita " Thatcher , but I never heard anything about it . The Thatchers are funny about that cemetery , " she wentpI74on , pondering . " Dave is always going up there . And Miss Adela . And even Bayard used to go up there once in awhile . " " Was she  --  Nita  --  any connection to Bayard ? " Florrie wrinkled her colorless eyebrows . " I do n't know , Miss Keate , but I do n't think so . I never heard anything at all about her . And if there 'd been anything , " added Florrie not at all enigmatically , " I 'd have known it . " I very nearly said , " You and everybody in C For three whole days I nursed Florrie . They were to all outward aspects quiet days , chiefly characterized by a determined and outwardly successful effort on the part of the Thatchers to ignore the matter of Bayard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . The only visible evidences that things were not as they appeared lay in the fact that Hilary and Evelyn stayed on , instead of returning to their own household , and that instead of getting a new housemaidduring Florrie 's illness , Janice and Evelyn between them took over her duties . This was , I had no doubt , to prevent letting a girl from town into the house and its intimate workings , a girl who would talk , would relate every scrap of gossip she could garner to all too willing ears . I knew that , so far , they had managed to keep Florrie 's illness a secret , although once Adela went to see Florrie 's mother , and I suppose she told her of it . I never knew what measures she took to insure the woman 's silence . Almost frantically they resumed that orderly dailyp175routine and clung to it as a man may cling to a straw to save himself from drowning . During those days I saw them together mostly at meals when they were bland , gracious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . At the same time 1 could hardly help knowing in a general way what went on in the house . Once I ventured into Bayard 's room and found it prim and orderly with drawn shades and Bayard what had become of the gin . Bayard was never mentioned . Every so often Strove would come to the house and talk apologetically of the diamonds and the burglar , and I would wonder anew just where my duty lay concerning those diamonds  --  and more urgently concerning my accumulating evidence that Bayard Thatcher had been murdered not by a marauding burglar but by one of his own family . I f the county authorities chose to ignore it , as they did , to whom ought I to appeal ? Or ought Ito appeal at all ? I think I had some faint notion that if any stranger actually was made a victim of , and the thing came to his arrest , I should step forward with what I knew . But in my heart I felt , I am sure , that it would not come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feeling of something impending was everywhere : in the air we breathed and the food we ate and in our eyes meeting and glancing quickly away . A climax was coming . We all knew it . It was in Janice 's set white face as she went about the cool , polished spaces of the house doing Florrie 's dusting , orp176working in her garden and later appearing fresh and beautiful at the dinner table , ready to take her role in that tragi-comedy of manners that went on every night  --  avoiding me and avoiding Allen , her dark eyes somber above quiet lips . It was in Adela 's bleak eyes and her blunt white fingers as they worked ceaselessly with her long turquoisebeads or with the flat silver beside her plate , and in her bland observations which saved us so frequentlyfrom a conversational trap and which yet were apt to break off in the middle as if she 'd completely forgotten what she had been saying . Even Emmeline grew nervous ; she twisted her fingersconstantly and took to having neuralgia and wafting a smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined peace of mind . Allen Carick looked taut and spent , as if he 'd been sleeping badly . And Evelyn decided to have the boys kept on at camp for a while after the summer session was over . " It 's as well not to let them come home just now , " she said , and later I heard her sending a carefully worded telegram over the telephone to the head of the school . I grew restless under that prevailing sense of strain and expectation , under the goading pressure of my many unanswered questions and unproved theories , and  --  more definitely  --  that unrelenting chaperonage . Every one of those three days I left the house for a time , and never , after Sunday , alone . Evelyn volunteeredonce to go for a walk with me , and I couldp177scarcely refuse . Another time Hilary turned up about four with the sedan and took Adela and me for a long and silent country ride  --  reluctantly , I think , and with a very red neck , which was all I could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by leaving from the hack door , I got away from the house unobserved , only to meet Allen a quarter of a mile away , rather breathless , as if he 'd run across country . He stuck to me like a burr , but was lost in his own not too pleasant thoughts , for he tramped along steadily with his hands in his pockets and his blue eyes frowning at the path , and only spoke twice during the whole walk , which I somewhat unkindly prolonged , taking him through some thickets where there were opening milkweed pods whose soft silks clung stubbornly to his trousers and resisted his savage efforts to brush them off . He swore a little under his breath and brushed with his hands and looked up at me and surprisingly laughed . He was very nice when he laughed : his sullen frown gave place to a sort of bright blue twinkle , and he had a direct and very charming way of smiling exactly into your eyes . " You win , Nurse , " he said , admitting his espionage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw me safe and incomunicado , so to speak , inside the door of the Thatcher house . The whole thing was an admission , I suppose , that something was to come . That there must be some change , some development , some climax of those hidden forces . But I think none of us guessed the dreadful turn that development was to take.  | My nerves were on edge , and I slept poorly at night . There were times when I suspected every memberof that family of having murdered Bayard . My only desire during those days was to get away . And Dr. Bouligny insisted on prolonging my stay . Florrie needed my care , he said . And the semblance of the ordinary , everyday state of affairs which they had built up was so real in its outward aspects that I could not refuse . I could not say openly that I wanted to leave , because  --  well , because Adela looked worried , harassed , and old  --  or Evelyn dark and ill  --  or Hilary frightened . That I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . That I was afraid . And I scarcely dared say that I wanted to leave because I was convinced that one of them had murdered a man . Nothing , however , happened during those three days ; it seems incredible as I write it , but it 's true . Florrie had got over her communicativeness ; Dave stayed out of sight , and when Dr. Bouligny asked what I had done with the remaining veronal tablets and I told him Evelyn had them he seemed quite satisfied and said no more about it . It was when Florrie was sitting up in a chair and an amazing dressing gown which only Florrie could have thought anything but poisonous , and was obviouslyabout to get up and stay up , that Adela undertookher campaign . I wonder how often she had rehearsed it , gone over every step of it , testing its weak points , before she sent for me the afternoon of the fourth day of Florrie 's illness.  |p179She  was in the library . The high-backed chair she had chosen added to her little air of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her polished eyeglasses . Her lavender silk gown fell in delicate folds , and there were her favorite snowy ruffles about her throat and wrists . She asked me a few questions about Florrie , said she hoped I would be with them a few days longer , gave me no opportunity to voice my own somewhat urgent views of the matter , and began : " Miss Ideate , " she said , " I have liked you very much . I feel you to be a woman of common sense and sanity . I want your help . " " My help ? " " Yes . You see  --  " her bleak blue eyes went to the open window for a moment to linger on the green stretches of sunlit lawn and the cool shadows of the shrubbery at its edge  --  " Bayard 's death has been a great shock . You know that . So far , we have not succeeded in discovering the man who did it . The man who stole the diamonds . Mr. Strove does n't seem to think we shall ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand that I myself am convinced  --  entirelyconvinced  --  that Bayard met his death at the hands of a wicked thief . At the same time it happened here  --  in my house  --  the Thatcher home for generations . There will be people who will say things . Anything . People are always ready to talk of a family which  --  " she hesitated here and then continued with quiet simplicity  --  " which has been more or less prominentand which has never lacked  --  worldly goods . Ip180could never be more completely convinced than I am now that the members of my family are innocent of this thing . Even the thought is absurd . But for their own protection I intend to prove it . " There was silence in the long old room : a silence so complete it was as if the books and the portraits and the old walls themselves were repeating her words : " I intend to prove it . " Even with the memory of that conversation which I had overheard when she had told Hilary and Evelyn that she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All those damaging things I knew swarmed into my thoughts . How could she prove their innocence when I knew there was no burglar ? When I knew that the diamonds had never been stolen ? When I knew about the revolver and about poor little Janice 's bloodstained hat ? When I knew so many things  --  and yet not enough . Janice said Bayard had been " bleeding the family for years . " Silence in that long room with the bare space almost at my feet where there had been the rug on which we found Bayard , dead . And the door to the little study where I knew he 'd actually been killed securely closed . I do n't know why I felt so sure that Dave was at that very moment in his soundproof study unless it was because I so seldom saw him and I knew that was his retreat . " I intend , " said Adela , slowly and deliberately in her elegant voice , " to prove it . And you can help me ,  |p181Miss  Keate , if you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing I ask , every inquiry I make and its answer . And if you feel that , in any case , I have not fully and thoroughly covered the ground , I want you to say so . To ask , in fact , anything that occurs to you . " Gradually I grasped the thing she proposed to do , which was apparently to conduct her own inquiry . To question in my hearing those who might be thought to have had some connection with the death of Bayard Thatcher . I wondered that she dared . It would take the wisdom of a serpent , the wiliness of a diplomat , the guarded care with which one walks on the edge of a precipice . She continued : " I have asked Emmeline to come first . I intend to question her , Miss Keate . And I want you to listen carefully . And if you are not entirely satis  --  " she checked herself on the very verge of giving herself and her motives away  --  " I mean if you think I have overlookedany  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You mean , " I said , " that you really want me to ask any questions that occur to me ? To make any inquiryI wish to make ? " She looked relieved ; I suppose because that was exactly what she did want . That was the only way in which I could be convinced . " That is exactly it , Miss Keate , " she said . " Please do n't hesitate at all . Do n't feel that any inquiry is at all " She floundered a little and then adroitlyskirted the dangerous ground . " You see , you have so much clearer a viewpoint than I. You are so much more apt to think of the obvious .  --  Oh , there you are ,  |p182Emmeline  . Come in , please . You may sit down . Emmeline , " as the gaunt woman sat stiffly and uncomfortably on the edge of a chair , glanced with distrust at me , and then back to Adela 's mouth , " Emmeline , I want to ask you a few questions about  --  about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer freely . Do you understand ? " " Yes , ma'am , " said Emmeline hoarsely , with anotherside glance at me , and her hands working in her white-aproned lap . There was a brief pause while Adela formulated her questions , and I remember wondering that Adela dared undertake such a dangerous campaign . Was she really convinced that her family  --  every member of it  --  was innocent ? Or could it be that she knew who had murderedBayard ? Knew and counted on her powers to protect him ? " You were making jelly in the back kitchen that afternoon . Did you see anybody at all besides Higby all that afternoon ? " " No , ma'am , not a soul . " " But of course you were not at the window of the kitchen all that time ? " " Why , yes , ma'am , I was . " " But , Emmeline , you could n't have been at the windowevery moment . " Adela 's face was granite again , her blue eyes like two stones . How she must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had not asked the woman to lie . " Why , yes , ma'am , " said Emmeline . " I was . Highy gets lazy when the weather gets warm . And Missp183Janice had told me you would all be gone that afternoonand I 'd better keep an eye on him . So I just Drought all the sugar and glasses and strainers and everything I would need to the long table below the t ' indow . I had the little stove right there too  --  you know how wide the windows are , Miss Adela  --  so there was no need for me to leave at all . And I kept an eye on him all the time like I said I would . He knew it , too . And worked right along . " " You can see the back door from there ? " " Why , of course . You know that , Miss Adela . You ca n't help seeing the back door . It 's right square in front of the window . No , ma'am , nobody went in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of the house that whole afternoon , ma'am . I 'm sure of it . Adela 's face looked gray and old and tired . But she was still stately and unmoved . " Can you see the library windows from the back kitchen ? " Emmeline looked scornful . " You know I ca n't , ma'am . " " Then anybody could have entered the library winowswithout your seeing him ? " Emmeline did not understand her immediately , andhe question had to be repeated . It was just at thatmoment , I believe , that Pansy waddled across theroom , looked at me suspiciously like a cranky little oldwoman , and settled with a tired puff at Adela 's feet . " Why , yes , Miss Adela , I suppose so . But Higbywas out there on the lawn all afternoon . I know that.  |p184I  can see most of the lawn , you know , and nobody could have crossed it without my seeing him . Unless he came from the front , and then Higby " " We 'll let Higby speak for himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , Emmeline  --  unless  --  Mist Keate ? " " When she came in through the house and foun . Bayard dead here in the library , did she see anybody Was the house quite deserted ? " Adela looked approving ; she put my question t Emmeline at once . " No , " said Emmeline . " There was nobody abou I 'd have seen him if there was . I have to let my eymakeup for my ears . " " Did you look through the rooms downstairs ? upstairs ? " " Why , of course not . You know what I did . Whc I passed the library door and looked in and saw him right there where you are sitting , Miss Keate , ma'a  --  I ran in to look at him . Right there on the floor h was . Dead as a doornail . I dropped my spoonful o jelly and ran outdoors , and there you was on the step I 've told you all that . " " You see , Miss Keate , someone could have bee hiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the burglar made his escape immediately . Is there anything else you think of ? " " Not just now , " I said slowly , thinking how difficult it was going to be to ask the things I really wante. to know without bringing somewhat dangerous su picion on my own head . What would they do , whatp185would they say , when they discovered all those things I knew ! " Very well , Emmeline . That is all . Higby is on the east lawn . Will you send him here , please . " We were silent while we waited ; Adela stared out on the lawn with unseeing blue eyes . I could not know what she thought of Emmeline 's stubborn refusal to admit the possibility of the fictitious burglar having got past her sharp eyes . It was one of the ironies of life that so short a time was to elapse before Adela was to be so frantically glad for that stubborn refusal . But she could n't know that , then , and I wondered what cr thoughts were as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confuse . Probably Adela 's bland stateliness awed him . He began by saying that not a fly could have got into the library windows without his , Higby 's , seeing it , and ended by admitting that thereere many times when his back was of necessity turned o those windows . " But there 's no shrubbery near the house , Miss Bela , except there in front . And my back would be rued only for a moment or two at a time . " " Much can happen in a moment , " said Adela . Do n't you agree with me , Miss Keate , that the burglar could have made his entrance into the house without Higby 's seeing him ? " " I do n't think anybody could " began Higbyhelplessly , and stopped on encountering Adela 's cold blue gaze . " There 's only this , " I said slowly . " A thief would have had to approach the windows from the back orp186front of the house . Since there are no side doors , he could n't have entered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of the house . And I am equally positive no one came from the front of the house . Between the three of us the whole circuit of the house was under observation . " Adela always knew when to agree . " That 's quite true , Miss Keate . But do n't you think it possible for an intruder to have somehow managed to approach the house from the west ? " " No , ma'am , " said Higby , sticking to his guns for a rather brief moment . " I know nobody did . " " But you were mowing the lawn continuously , " remindedAdela affably . " Yes , ma'am , " said Higby , looking uncomfortable and shifting about on his feet . " And in pushing the lawnmower up and down the stretches of lawn your back was often turned to the windows and to the lawn itself at different angles . And you were paying attention to your work . " " Oh , yes , ma'am , " said Higby looking further discomfited . " You see , Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching his work all the time . Probably paid little attention to anything else . It seems very clear to me that someone could have run across the lawn back of him , watched his chance , likely , to do so , and then slipped into the house . These screens , you see , can he M1 unhooked and opened quite readily . And closed as readily . Thieves are very adept at that sort of thing.  |p187Do  you think of anything you 'd like to ask ? Do you feel quite convinced ? " " Were the screens , then , closed when they examined the house after Bayard 's  --  death ? " " Why , really , " said Adela politely , " I do n't know . I do n't believe anyone thought to look . They can be opened and closed so readily . " Her bland voice trailed away into space as if my question had not been of much interest . " But , ma'am , " said Higby , lingering , " I do n't think  --  I 'm sure nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide strip of open lawn " " But you 've already said it was possible , Higby , " said Adela pleasantly . " I 'm afraid we ca n't depend upon your testimony at all , if you change about like this . You may go now , " she concluded loftily . And added , " Thank you , " in a way that sent Higby , crushed , out of the room . He stopped in the doorway to say again , in the manner of one who fires his last shot but knows in his heart it will have no effect , " But nobody did " and Adela murmured , " That is all . " He disappeared , vanquished , and she smiled at me . " I 'm afraid poor Higby is n't too certain of anything . That type seldom is . He and his family would have starved long ago if we had n't found something for him to do . But he does n't like to work . Has to be watched and directed every moment . " Emmeline stood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ma'am . " I think Adela was glad for the respite . She said affably :  | " Ask her to come in here , Emmeline . It 's the wife of the man who manages the east farm , " she said in an explanatory way to me . " Very worthy people , they are . We 've never had better on that farm . Oh , goodafternoon , Mrs. Steadway . Come in . It 's good of you to come . " " I 'd have come long ago , Miss Adela , but I 've been busy with the canning . We are so sorry to hear about the trouble you 've had . " She was a fresh-faced woman , large and neat and capable looking , but a little uncomfortable under Adela 's eyeglasses and graciousness . " Do sit down , Mrs. Steadway . This is my nurse , Miss Keate . Yes , it 's been a great shock to me . To us all . " " That 's what I told my husband . Miss Janice was out to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess she did n't dream what was happening here . " " No . No . Dear Janice . Such a shock . " Adela sat erect and stately in the high-backed chair regarding her caller through her eyeglasses . There was a short silence . Mrs. Steadway 's faint look of discomfortbecame more acute . She moved uneasily in her chair , glanced at me , glanced at Adela , hunted for something to say . " Yes , that 's what I told my husband . I said , she did n't dream what was happening here while she stopped her car there on the hill above the farm and talked to young Mr. Carick. "  |p189IN  ALL probability Mrs. Steadway has never known the fateful part she played in the Thatcher case . Indeed , it was imperative from Adela 's viewpoint that she should not know . This was apparent even in that first moment of shocked astonishment following the unexpected revelation , while I watched Adela 's face lose its careful graciousness and become stiffly blank . The swift , anxious drawing together of her reserves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I marveled that our caller could sit there , still with that air of timid politeness , entirely unaware of the crushingblow she had dealt . " You mean Allen Carick ? " said Adela stiffly . " He is visiting my brother Mr. Thatcher and his wife . He is Evelyn 's brother , you know . We are all very fond of Allen , " she said deliberately , and then , because she had to know , she added , " Dave  --  my brother Dave  --  was with him . " " Oh , no , " said Mrs. Steadway , only too glad to relieveher awkward discomfort with conversation . " No , he was n't there . There was just Mr. Carick . He was driving Frank Whiting 's old roadster , and when I saw the car stop there beside the coupe Miss Janice was driving I thought it must be Frank Whiting , and I wondered if somebody had died out our way . Then I saw Mr. Carick get out ; he went and leaned against the door of the coupe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Mr. Thatcher was n't with him . " " Yes . Yes . We are all so fond of Allen , " repeated Adela with blue lips . " Hilary bought the old roadster of Mr. Whiting for the boys to use . They will soon be home for the rest of the summer . How did you get along with your canning ? Things are early this year , are n't they ? " And she sat there , fumbling with her blue beads , looking at her caller with bleak blue eyes , still stately , still gracious , somehow asking questions of the farm and listening to their replies and finally permitting the conversation to lapse suggestively . Mrs. Steadway 's skirt had scarcely vanished into the hall before Adela rose with a soft rustling of lavender silk , gave me a blank look that might have meant anything , and walked slowly to the door of Dave 's study . She knocked , listened for a moment , and returned slowly to her chair . " I do n't like to disturb him , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lately . But of course I must ask him I thought they were together all afternoon . Fishing . He and Allen . But Emmeline said no one came Oh , Janice . It 's you . Come in , my dear . " Janice hesitated for a moment , sensing , I think , something in the atmosphere , for she looked swiftly from Adela to me and back again and said : " Is anything wrong ? " " No . No . Only , Janice  --  Mrs. Steadway was here just now , and she happened to mention that Allen metp191you on the hill above the farm the afternoon Bayard was killed . And that Dave  --  Dave was not with him . Is that true ? " Janice walked slowly toward us , her plain white dress , rather severely tailored , showing the graceful lines of her young body . Her face had for an instant flamed into beauty , as if the recollection of those few moments was so sweet that their loveliness could not be denied even at such an anxious moment . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little frightened . She sat down , her hands going out to clasp the arms of the chair . The light from the west windowswas on her face and showed rather cruelly the purple marks under her eyes , and caught a high light from her slender wedding ring . " Yes , " she said . Adela looked bewildered , frightened , and hard . " But you did n't mention it before . We all thought Dave and Allen were together the entire afternoon . " " No , I did n't mention it . We , Allen and I , thought it better not to . And Dave said nothing . Under the circumstances , we thought it as well to let people supposewhat you all assumed was true . That Allen and Dave had been together all afternoon . It was only to prevent unpleasant comment or  --  questions . " " Then , Janice , where was Dave ? " " I do n't know . " The girl glanced doubtfully at me . Adela closed her eyes for a moment as if to summonstrength . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that none of my family is in any way connected with with Bayard 's death . I know it so well that I am undertakingto prove it . I want Miss Keate to hear everything . I am convinced that she can hear everything . " " I do n't know where Dave was , " said Janice slowly . " And he 's not been feeling well lately  --  I did n't like to ask him . Allen said when I met him there above the farm that Dave had found it pretty warm fishing and said he 'd take a walk . That it would help his head . So Allen took the roadster , drove out toward the farm , met me just leaving . We talked a while , and then he drove back to the lake and met Dave . Dave said his headache was gone and they both fished until  --  well , until they came back to the house . And found us all  --  here in the library . " " Dave took a walk ? " said Adela . " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women met . " I do n't know , " said Janice . " But  --  of course , he did n't come back to the house . Emmeline would have seen him . Or Higby . Or Miss Keate . " " That 's true , " said Adela at once . " That 's quite true . He could n't have walked in this direction . I 'll ask him , though . I should have known this long ago ; yet you and Allen were right not to speak of it . It was quite unnecessary to mention . Janice , dear , do you mind answering a few questions ? " " Not at all , Adela . You mean questions about --  " About Bayard , my dear . " " Oh . About Bayard . " Janice 's white fingers seemed to clutch the arms of her chair . There was no beauty now in her face . But there was a certain compre- ! tension , as if she guessed Adela 's purpose . And there was also a guarded look I did not like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Adela , resolute though she was with her bleak eyes and the granite in her face , found her inquiries difficult . She sat there , drawing the blank blue beads through her blunt fingers . Presently she said : " Janice , the afternoon Bayard was killed , when we  --  you and I  --  returned home late in the afternoon , I walked down among the flowers , and you took the baskets and went directly to the house . What did you do ? " Very white was Janice now , her slender fingers taut . " I took the baskets to the kitchen and went up the back stairs . " " Where did you leave the baskets ? " " I put the egg basket in the refrigerator . The basket with the butter and buttermilk I left on the table for Emmeline to empty . " " When you went past the door of the library  --  this door did you Oh , Janice , my dear , I ca n't questionyou like this . Wo n't you tell me the truth ? Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Janice rose , walked to the door of Dave 's study , listened for a moment , then walked slowly back , her dark head bent . She looked grave and yet steady . " Is Dave in his study ? " she asked Adela . " Yes , I believe so . I have n't seen the poor boy since breakfast . I 'm afraid he 's got one of his headaches , but I do n't like to disturb him . He may be asleep . He sleeps so wretchedly . I should n't like to wake him if he 's actually getting any rest . " Something about protestingtoo much went vaguely through my head , though I could n't have told why . Janice had stopped beside a chair , her hands moving over its high carved back . " He 's not been at all well , " she said thoughtfully . " I 'm afraid he 's taken Bayard 's death badly . None of us blames him for it . Yes , Adela , Bayard was dead when I came through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adela 's face as if she had fought a battle and won . " And you came in and bent to look at him ? " " Yes . " " And you had on  --  forgive me , dear , but I must ask it  --  you had on your white felt hat ? And you bent and  --  and touched him to be sure he was dead ? And your fingers  --  that 's how the stain was on your hat ? " Janice was looking somberly out the window ; her eyes were large and dark in her white face , and it seemed to me I caught a flicker of horror in their depths . " Yes . That 's how it happened . " " And you were shocked . So shocked you did n't know what you were doing . And frightened  --  as any sensitive girl would be frightened . You ran upstairs . Took off your hat . Heard Emmeline 's screams and came down again . And then in the excitement and hurry and commotionthere was no occasion for you to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment or two . "  | " No occasion , " said Janice in a stifled sort of way , still looking out onto the green summer lawn . " You see , Miss Keate ? And then , Janice , you did n't purposely hide your hat . I mean you did n't hide it becauseof the  --  the stains on it . Did you ? " " Not exactly hide it , Adela . But I  --  did n't like the stains on it . I intended to clean it . In cold water , you know . But I did n't have time . And of course , I did n't want anyone to see it . But Florrie found it . " There was no apology , no suggestion of explanation in Janice 's voice . It was rather detached and remote , as if she were stating quite impersonal facts about something that was of very little interest to her . " That hat , you know , was the least of it . " " Then there is  --  the matter of the revolver , Janice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to me . Miss Keate was with me at the time . We  --  you  --  you did n't " Suddenly the detached manner left Janice . Her face became full of life and she turned swiftly toward Adela . " Do n't ask me about the revolver , Adela , " she said almost fiercely . " Do n't ask me that . You see , I do n't lie very well . " Adela stood , stately , a little severe in her lavender silk with her eyeglasses catching the light . " I 'm not asking you to lie , Janice , " she said . " I only want you to tell me the truth . The truth is the only thing that can save us . " The two women faced each other for a long moment . Each so resolute , each so proudly unbent ;  |p196Janice  's swift steel matched against Adela 's sturdy , rocklike determination . Finally Janice said : " You do n't know  --  you ca n't know what you are asking . " I believe , just for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do know . I know . Why do n't you tell me the truth ? None of you will tell me . I feel you are all keeping something back . You and Hilary and Evelyn  --  all of you . As if I were a helpless old woman . And I 'm not . It 's my house . It 's my family . I must know . " Adela 's blunt white hands were shaking . It was the only time I saw her drop that impregnable shield of dignity with which she faced her family and the world . Her appeal touched Janice . I could see the girl 's face soften ; I felt she was about to speak . It was curiously tantalizing , like a play , that Evelyn should appear in the doorway at exactly that moment and enter . Both Adela and Janice turned at the sound of her footsteps . Evelyn 's dark blue eyes went rapidly from one to the other . She said , as Janice had said : " Is anything wrong ? " " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why will none of you help me ? I ca n't do this alone . " Evelyn did not ask what . With her swift common sense she grasped the situation at once , I think . PerhapsAdela 's amazing moment of weakness shocked her as it did me.  | " We 'll do anything we can to help you , Adela , " she said calmly . " Good heavens , it 's warm this afternoon ! Ca n't Emmeline make us some iced tea ? Never mind , Adela , I 'll speak to her . " It was very still in the library while Evelyn walked with her customary long , graceful strides to the door . Emmeline must have been near , for we could clearly hear Evelyn 's concise directions . Adela turned away from Janice and sat down again in her high-backed chair and resumed at once her beads and her dignity . And Janice , white and still , stood by the table , touching and arranging the roses in the big green howl , with hands that trembled a little . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I think she did not quite know what she was doing . Then Evelyn was back in the room , tossing her hat onto a chair and sitting down with a sigh . " Now , then , " she said , coolly matter-of-fact , " what is it you want me to do , Adela ? " " I only want you to tell me the truth , Evelyn , " said Adela deliberately . She was again complete mistress of herself . " That is the only way in which I can prove " She stopped , touched me with her cold blue eyes , and resumed , " We have no need to fear the truth . " Evelyn 's clear eyes went to me , too . She took off her gloves , stripping them off her brown hands with two quick gestures , touched her straight gold hair to be sure it was smooth and said : " I 've just been up at the house . There was a letter from the boys . And one from Aunt Hetty . Allen and Hilary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be in , in a moment  --  here they are now . " " Good Lord , it 's hot , " said Hilary . He was pink and coatless , with dampish spots on his shirt . Allen took Adela 's hand gently . " Sit down , Allen , " said Adela . " You have come in good time . I want you  --  all of you  --  to help me . " Something in her voice caught Hilary 's quick attention . He stopped wiping his face with his handkerchief , glanced swiftly at Adela and sharply at me , and said at once : " Certainly , Adela . Certainly . " " You see , " said Adela , " I think we owe it to ourselves to prevent  --  any talk there may be about  --  Bayard 's death . " The last two words came out rather jerkily , as if with tremendous effort on Adela 's part . The room was very still for a moment  --  still , yet echoing those two words : Bayard 's death . Bayard 's death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which of you killed him ; are you going to tell ? Are you going to be trapped ? " Any unpleasant talk , " said Adela rather stiffly and stuck again , looking rather helplessly at Evelyn . And Evelyn , blessedly direct , said : " You mean people are apt to hint that one of us killed Bayard ? Why , of course , they will . Probably have already . People are n't going to pass up such a chance for talk . I think that 's very wise of you , Adela . It 's a good thing to prove to our own or any outsider 's satisfaction that none of us killed him . Is n't that what you mean ? "  | " Why  --  why , yes , " said Adela , taken rather off her feet , I think , by Evelyn 's blunt stating of the situation . " Go right ahead , Adela , " said Hilary a bit pompously . " I am ready for any inquiry you  --  or anyone else  --  choose to make . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that even if I had not overheardthat family conference I would have known what they were attempting to do . Well , I might spare Janice if I could ; I might even keep the affair of the diamonds a secret . But Hilary was , so to speak , a horse of another color . " Indeed , " continued Hilary . " You might like me to undertake this  --  er  --  inquiry . I 'm more accustomed to matters of this sort . " " Thank you , Hilary , " said Adela tartly . " I 'll do it myself . The point just now is to get you all to tell me the truth . Not to try to hide things from me . We do n't fear the truth . Hilary , where was Bayard when you last talked to him ? " " Here in the library . " " What did you talk of ? " " Why , nothing much . I asked him how he felt . If there was anything I could do for him . Ah , here'smmeline with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seemed to me his gusto was a little forced . Ice tinkled in the tall glasses . Emmeline , tall and black and spotlessly aproned , passed the tray . The interruptiongave us all a little rest from the growing tension . Adela sipped her tea delicately , slowly . Asp200Emmeline put the tray on the table and went away , she said : " You and Bayard had had no trouble , had you , Hilary ? If you had , you know , someone is bound to have heard of it . There are no secrets in C . " " No , of course not , " said Hilary . He gulped some tea and continued : " That is , no more than we 'd always had , and you know all about that . He wanted more money , but you knew that . He always wanted money . He 'd been bleeding us white for years . " " Hilary ! Do n't use such coarse expressions . " Adela. was chalk gray . She set her glass carefully on the table and touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Keate . I suppose everyone in the county knows that Bayard was  --  a source of much anxiety and trouble to us . He " He was an out-and-out scoundrel , " said Hilary , flushing as if the bare memory infuriated him . " Time after time we gave him money , started him in some kind of business , tried to establish him . He always failed , squandered the money , came back for more . And he always worked around us somehow to get it . If he could n't appeal to our sympathies he Hilary stopped abruptly , the frightened look coming into his eyes as they went quickly to Evelyn . " Perhaps you do n't know , Miss Keate , " said Evelyn , " how difficult it is to have someone like that in the family . We could n't permit him to disg ace our name . To do the things he would threaten to do . And then besides  --  I think we may as well tell her the whole truth about it , Hilary . "  | " Nonsense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is . You see , Miss Keate , when Hilary was a boy he did something very silly . It was when he and Dave and Bayard were all in prep school to-gether . " " Do you think there 's really any need to tell that , Evelyn ? " asked Adela , her face looking old and shrunken , her blunt white hands pulling the beads back and forth , back and forth . " Yes , " said Evelyn sensibly . " It ca n't do us any harm . We all know about it , and Hilary found the check in Bayard 's things and destroyed it . And if we do n't tell Miss Keate the truth after having gone so far , she 'll think it was something much worse than it Is . It was only a boyish scrape , Miss Keate . Hilary had o have some money for something  --  something that ccmed terribly urgent to him then . " " We 'd been playing cards  --  gambling a little , " said Hilary , looking pompous and blustering and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I lost , nd the kid I owed threatened to tell the Head if I id n't pay him . He  --  this kid  --  was leaving school anyow , so he did n't care . But I knew I 'd be expelled . Anddid n't have a cent , and Adela would never sendecks between our allowance checks unless she knewby we wanted extra money and approved of it . Bayard  --  how I do n't know  --  had some money in the ank , and I  --  well , I forged his name to a check . " Heiped his face again . It was strange to hear that man , with sons of his own , confessing the boyhood scrape . " It was only a small amount . We 'd often amused our/selves  --  you know how kids are  --  writing and imitatingeach other 's signatures . But Bayard  --  Bayard kept the check . It was written in pencil ; he erased the date and amount and kept it all these years , threatening to fill it in for a larger amount , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got far with it  --  still I 'm not sure . It would have raised an awful stink . " " Hilary ! " said Adela in faint protest . " Well , you know , Adela , there 'd have been plenty of people to jump at the chance to discredit me . For a banker it would have been " Then he was using that check to bring pressure just now ? " I said . Hilary looked at me uncomfortably . " Yes . He wanted a large sum of money . Larger than I could give him . He thought it was a good time to squeeze . " " But Hilary , you did n't quarrel with him . That last afternoon . " " No , Adela , " said Hilary heavily . " I did n't quarrel with him . " " You did n't " it was Allen , standing at the window , his back to us , speaking rather softly . " You did n't shoot him . For that . " Hilary leaped to his feet , his plump face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scoundrel . A disgrace to the family . But I would n't have killed him . Good God , I could n't do that . " " You left him alive , " said Evelyn quickly . " As I found him . Remember , Allen , that I was the last onep203to see Bayard alive . That was after Hilary had talked to him . " Allen turned suddenly away from the window , walked to Evelyn , and put his hand under her chin , looking down at her upturned face and smiling a little into the steady dark blue eyes so like his own . The two bright heads shone above the two brown faces . " That 's all right then , " he said . " We all know you did n't shoot him . " " Then , " said Hilary , " Bayard was alive when Evelyn left him . Dead when Emmeline found him not an hour later . No one of the family saw him during that time " You are wrong , Hilary , " said Janice . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm and came into the house a few moments ahead of Adela I found him dead . I saw him dead before Emmeline found him . " " Janice --  Allen was at her side . We 'd havebeen blind , all of us , not to have seen the love and fear in his face . But she pushed him away with steady hands . " No , I did n't shoot him . But I 'm glad he 's dead . I think we ought to stop this talk . We ought not to try to discover who did it . If it was one of the family , how much better not to --  " " But , Janice , " said Adela hoarsely , as if her throat and mouth were numb , " it was not one of the family . it was the burglar . We are only proving " " You ought not to have started this , Adela , " said Hilary agitatedly . " Better let sleeping dogs lie . "  | " You 'll have to let me do as I think best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me , Janice , about the revolver . " " The revolver ! " cried Hilary , bouncing to his feet again . " What revolver ? What about it ? " " I  --  I warned you not to ask me , Adela , " said Janice . Allen 's hands went out to hers . " Do n't talk , Janice . Do n't say anything " Hush , Allen . The revolver  --  was on the floor  --  besideBayard . I put it in the egg basket  --  to hide it . " " The egg basket ! " cried Hilary , quite frantic with bewilderment . " What on earth are you talking about ? What do you mean ? For heaven 's sake , speak up ! Why did you hide it ? " " Why did I hide it ? " repeated Janice , as if we should have known . " Why , you see , " she said helplessly , " it was Dave 's . Dave 's revolver . He 'd already shot Bayard once with it . " " Janice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her feet , her eyes like ice , her thickish body swaying a little . " You are out of your senses . " " Now , Adela , wait . It was natural for Janice to think it might have been Dave who shot him . " Allen was speaking rapidly , trying to get Adela 's attention . Giving them all time , I thought . " If she came in , saw Bayard had been shot , was dead , saw Dave 's revolver , of course her first thought would be that Dave might have shot him . She 's not saying he did . She does n't think Dave killed Bayard . She only acted hurriedly . Her first thought was to hide the revolver . To conceal the fact . She acted , " said Allen gravely andp205rather sadly , " only as a loyal wife . You ought to be the last to reproach her for it . " Evelyn stood . " I think we are letting things get away from us , " she said bluntly . " There 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much and not getting any place . The burglar could have picked up Dave 's revolver and used it . Just because it was Dave 's revolver , there on the floor , does n't prove anything . Does n't prove Dave used it . Does n't even prove Bayard was killed by a bullet from that gun . Does n't prove anything . Janice was frightened and shocked and acted hurriedly . The burglar must have just escaped . I think we ought to concentrate on finding the burglar . When I left , Bayard was alive . And Dave and Allen were together . " " Not all the afternoon , Evelyn , " said Adela . " I have just discovered that Dave took a walk alone , and Allen went for a drive , met Janice near the east farm , and they talked awhile . Mrs. Steadway happened to mention it . Janice and Allen thought it unwise to tell that , after all , Dave and Allen did not each have the complete alibi we all thought they had . Janice and Allen acted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But did n't you meet again , Allen ? You returned together . You came into the library together , " said Evelyn . " Yes , " replied Allen . " After leaving Janice I drovedirectly back to the lake , and Dave was there . Wefished for quite a while and then came home together . " " Why , then , that 's all right , " said Evelyn , relieved .   " You see , Adela , they were together from  --  what time , Allen ? " " About four , or a little earlier , " said Allen . " And you left Bayard alive at ten after four . So you see , Adela , Dave 's alibi is still good . " " And yours too , incidentally , Allen , " said Hilary rather bitterly . Allen shrugged . " I ca n't help that . " " That is right , " I said , addressing Evelyn . " You were here after four . I am sure of that , for I saw you . The burglar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to the door of the library , here , and glanced in ? " " Yes , " said Evelyn . " Bayard was here ? " " Yes . I did n't speak to him . He did n't see me . " " Oh , yes , I remember you said that . The burglar must have come in directly after . When you were here , was the safe open ? " " Why , no , " said Evelyn , frowning . " I remember distinctly . It was closed . " " Evelyn ! " shouted Hilary . " Good God , do n't you know what you 've done ? That woman has tricked you . " He was purple with rage . " She 's tricked you . You 've admitted that Bayard was --  " He stopped , thoroughly frightened now , staring at me , on the verge of apoplexy . " Why , no  --  I " said Evelyn . " The safe , " I said , watching Hilary , " is in Dave 's study . Bayard was actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk . He was killed in Dave 's study . He was dead  --  " I looked at Evelyn  --  " when you saw him . " Evelyn stared back at me . She was not a liar by inspiration ; she had to be coached , and there was no time for that . She nodded slowly . Hilary sucked in his breath with a sort of groan and sat down as if his knees had weakened under him . I heard Allen say under his breath , " Dave 's study . " Adela 's face was granite . I met their eyes  --  all of them , it seemed to me , hating me . And perhaps fearingme . " Janice , " said Adela , " call Dave . I think we must question him . " The room was so still that Janice 's small heels made tap-taps of sound along the floor . She knocked on the door of the study . There was no answer , and she put her hand on the doorknob , opened the door , and stepped inside . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seemed a long time before she stood in the doorwayagain . She just stood there , her back to the room beyond , facing us , swaying a little . We were all standing . She said : " You ca n't question Dave . You ca n't ask him any-thing  --  ever  --  again . "  |p208FROM  the first it was not so much a question of Dave 's having been murdered as it was a question of whether he had taken the veronal accidentally or intentionally . In other words , whether or not he was a suicide . And if he had committed suicide , was it a confession of guilt ? Had he murdered Bayard ? For Dave was dead . And he died of an overdose of veronal . Dr. Bouligny established that fact within twenty minutes of Janice 's shocking announcement . I do not remember much of the few moments immediatelyfollowing her words as she stood there at the door of the little study , nor of how we crowded into that room , nor of what we said and did and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long couch where that silent body lay and making sure that Janice was not mistaken , that Dave was actually dead . And I remember how peaceful his face looked . It is true , of course , that most faces of the dead look peaceful , but there was a look about Dave 's face as of one who seeks his rest with the tranquillity of complete surrender . Singularly enough , while we were all thinking of Adela and trying to spare her , it was Hilary who went to pieces and collapsed on a chair in the library where Allen led him and sat there shivering and shaking withp209his hands over his face trying to hide dreadful man hysteria . Adela was like a woman carved in stone . She stood at the foot of Dave 's couch and looked at him with a still hard face and told Evelyn to telephone for the doctor , and told Allen to take Hilary away and Janice to bring her a chair . " I intend to stay here , " said Adela stiffly . " Thank you , Janice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a daze . It was only when Adela reached out and took one of Dave 's hands that Janice sank down on the floor beside Adela and buried her head in her arms . The toe of her slim white slipper rested exactly over the spot on the Sarouk rug where I had discovered that damp crimson patch . Evelyn turned away from the telephone . " He will be here right away , " she said . " Do n't look like that , Adela . You know how sick Dave has been . For such a long time he has not been himself . Perhaps it is better . " " Death , " said Adela , " is never better . " And Janice lifted her dark head and looked at Evelyn as if she were a creature of a different world . I am sure that , then , Janice only felt a great pity for Dave and for Adela ; she had not yet thought of her own freedom . There was nothing hypocritical about her grief ; it was the sorrow of affection and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had not tried to escape any of the responsibilities of her marriage . And then , she must have loved him once . Even an unsentimentaland an honest woman may weep at the end of ap210marriage which has failed or at the grave of a forgottenlove . And Dave was much more than that : He was her husband , an integral part of her world , a vital and important factor in her life . Dr. Bouligny came very soon : his thick black hair ruffled , his coat baggy , his face growing somber and troubled as he listened to what we said and looked at Dave . He took Adela 's pulse , I remember , and sent Evelyn for some wine , and got us all out of the study and into the library with the door closed between . Adela never resisted him , and she did not do so then ; she put Dave 's poor limp hand carefully on the edge of the couch and obeyed Dr. Bouligny . At his request I closed the door and followed them . The examination had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better , " he said to Adela , " go straight to bed and take a bromide . You ca n't stand this . " Adela was sipping the wine Evelyn had brought . I have always marveled at Adela 's fortitude at that dreadful time ; but then all of them behaved rather well . All but Hilary , and perhaps Hilary had more for which to reproach himself ; he must have drifted far from Dave during recent years . " Why did Dave die ? " asked Adela directly , brushingaside his suggestion as if it had not been made . Dr. Bouligny looked worried . He ran his fingers through his thick hair , further disheveling it . " We 'd better all of us sit down and talk quietly . Here , Hilary  --  give him some wine , Miss Keate , please . If you are determined to thresh this thing out here and now " He paused , looking anxiously atp211Adela . " Well , perhaps it is best . You are sure you can bear it all ? " " What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother " Adela 's mouth twisted a little over the words . They were her only audible expression of the turmoil of grief and pain and desolation in her heart . It was a moment before she could continue . Presently she said , her face gray and blank and set , and her eyes like a cold blue wall between us and her thoughts , and her voice rather harshly deliberate : " Why did Dave die ? Tell me , Daniel . " Dr. Bouligny sighed heavily . I gave the small glass to Hilary , who took it and gulped the wine in a dazed fashion . I do n't think he realized what he was doing or that I , whom he disliked so fervently , had given him the drink . He did seem to come to himself , however ; he rose and approached the small tragic group and , I believe , began to consider the matter of Dave 's death in its possible relation to our dreadful problem . " Dave died , " said Dr. Bouligny , " of an overdose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a breathless way . He was still very pale and had none of his usual self-assurance. " flow did Dave get veronal ? Why did he take it ? " " I do n't know where he got it , " Dr. Bouligny said . " Janice , my dear , do you mind answering a few questions ? You see , I 've got to sign my coroner 's certifi-cate . " " What is it ? " The girl was like a pale , still little statue in her white gown ; her hands were clasped rather desperately together as if to restrain theirP212trembling , but otherwise she held herself with amazing courage . " About Dave , " he said . " How 's he been feeling lately ? " " About as usual , I think , " said Janice slowly . " Has he been sleeping well ? " " I do n't know . He never sleeps well , but I 've not heard him complain recently . You see , he spends so much of his time here in his study . And we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She stopped . " That he 's been taking something to make him sleep ? " asked Dr. Bouligny . " Why , yes , I think so , " she said . " But he never told me , and I 've seen nothing , though I 've watched . " " He has n't said anything about having any difficulty with his eyesight lately ? " " Yes , " said Janice , " a little . He did n't care to read . And once or twice he said things blurred . " " What about his speech ? And his walk ? Has he been a little slow of speech ? Has he seemed to lack a certainexactness of movement ? " I longed to reply to Dr. Bouligny , as I saw what he meant and marveled that I had not seen it in Dave days earlier . But Janice said hesitantly : " Yes . A little . He  --  oh , he 's not been himself at all , Dr. Dan . " Dr. Bouligny stared at the rug for a moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know why I did n't see it , " he said slowly . " You should have told me  --  I did n't realize --  " What is it , Daniel ? " said Adela . He looked at her slowly . " It 's going to go hard with you , Adela , " he said . " But I suppose you 've got to know . You see Dave 's been  --  Dave was a drug addict . " " Drug , " said Adela , as if she were merely repeatingwords without any comprehension at all of their meaning . " Addict . " " Yes , " said Dr. Bouligny miserably . " He took veronal . He must have taken too much at last . Poor fellow . I could have cured him if I 'd known it in time . " Adela was on her feet . Her eyes were no longer blank and cold ; they were blazing blue fire . There was a very fury in her eyes and in her broken voice as she said harshly : " Veronal ! Veronal ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bouligny , his eyes pitying , nodded his great head . " I could have cured it , Adela , " he said gently . " But I did n't know . Dave has been vaguely unwell for so long  --  I did n't see it , and none of you knew . If it had been morphine or cocaine or any of those drugs , I would n't have been at all sure of success . But veronal  --  I could have cured him of that habit . " That was the second time I saw Adela falter . All that rocklike strength suddenly left her ; she sagged down into her chair again , her thick body loose and old , her face flabby , her eyes closed . " She 's fainting , " said Dr. Bouligny . " Evelyn , help me . " P214Adela motioned them back with her blunt white hands . " No . No . Let me alone . " There was such vehement command in her gesture that Evelyn and Dr. Bouligny and I paused involuntarily . After watching Adela for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Evelyn went back to stand beside Janice . Allen , tall and brown and grave , stood a little in the background and scarcely took his eyes from Janice during the whole time . " It 's always that way , " said Dr. Bouligny . " That is the danger of veronal . It is , in a manner of speaking , a perfectly harmless drug . But taken over a period of time it does not induce tolerance on the part of the patient , as , for instance , morphine does . At the same time veronal tends to lose something of its effect when taken habitually . Thus the patient is apt to increase the dose , and since his system has not grown tolerant any heavy increase is usually fatal . That is why we hear of so many deaths from veronal . " He was talking nervously , rubbing his heavy chin with his hand and watchingAdela . Hilary cleared his throat . " It 's a peaceful death , is n't it , Dan ? " " Why , yes , Hilary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't suffer . Do n't worry about that . " " Peaceful , " said Hilary slowly . " That is why it is so often used for suicide . " It was the first time the word had been spoken . Janice started to her feet , dreadfully white and horrified , and then sank slowly back again , her wide darkP215eyes on Dr. Bouligny ; Evelyn put out her brown hands as if in reproach and denial , and Adela in her chair stiffened . Slowly her body became firm and erect . She lifted her face . It was no longer flabby and sunken and old ; it was granite again , set with resolve . From that moment on to the last it was as if Adela were consumedwith a white fever of energy and resolve ; as if she could not rest , could not wait , could not even permitherself sorrow until she had cleared Dave 's memory of the dreadful imputation . That was the thing that kept her from collapse ; that was the purpose that animated her every move . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in continuing that extraordinary inquiry which Dave 's death had so unexpectedlyand terribly interrupted . For she did just that , incredible though it is . Now she turned her blue eyes upon Hilary and said rather hoarsely : " Suicide . Did you say suicide ? What do you mean ? " Hilary shrugged helplessly . " I meant suicide , Adela . " " Do you dare sit there before my very eyes and say that your own brother is a suicide ? " Hilary looked too unhappy to be further disconcertedby Adela 's scathing tone . He said : " Suicide has been a confession of guilt before now . " I heard Janice catch her breath as if it hurt her . Adela 's face did not alter . " I knew that was in your mind , " said Adela with relentless scorn . " I knew when you said suicide exactly what you meant . You want us to believe , all of us , thatP216Dave killed Bayard and then killed himself to escape the consequences . That 's what you want us to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a broken , cold way . " It is an easy way out for you . For all of us . But we are not going to take that way . Hilary , Hilary , how can you ! And Dave  --  only just dead . " " I 'm sorry , Adela , " said Hilary . He was gradually reassuming the slightly pompous air that was natural with him , although he still looked shaken ; his fat hands were unsteady , and his eyes had a tendency to dart about the room and avoid directly meeting other eyes . " I 'm sorry . But I do n't see any other thing to believe . It is painfully evident . We have all known how Dave has brooded lately ; especially since Bayard 's death . How depressed he has been . Why , we have scarcely seen him ; he 's done nothing but sit in his study there and brood . I do n't want to think that he killed Bayard and then committed suicide . You may not think it , Adela , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't escape the fact . I ca n't close my eyes to it from sentiment . To me it is as good as proved . Dave killed Bayard . " Dr. Bouligny , anxious eyes on Adela 's cold face , - moved restlessly . " That depression of Dave 's meant nothing , Hilary , " he said . " It is one of the symptoms of his condition . Veronal addicts are subject to periods of extreme mentaldepression . His depression was no sign that he was brooding over Bayard 's death . All those things we talked of were symptoms . I must have been blind not to see it . But it came very gradually . " " It dated , " said Adela cruelly , " from his last ill-P217ness . When you , Daniel , gave him things to make him sleep . " Dr. Bouligny 's large fingers rubbed his chin worriedly . " Adela , " he said , " you do n't mean that . I would never do a thing like that . I " Forgive me , " said Adela @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you contributed to this dreadful habit of Dave 's . To Dave 's death . No , I did not mean that , Daniel . Dave has always been weak . Has always needed help . And I failed him . I failed him , but 1 ' 11 prove he did not murder . I 'll prove --  " Her eyesfell on me , and perhaps it was then that she remembered what Dave 's death had interrupted , and resolved to continue that inquiry . Only now there was a more pressing reason to prove her family 's innocence . " You ca n't prove that , Adela , " said Hilary wearily . " It is best to leave things as they are . We 'll bury Dave , and we 'll remember the things we loved him for . We 'll remember him as he was before his  --  " Hilary paused and then said rather sadly and kindly  --  " his illness . I 'll telephone to Frank Whiting now . We 'd better say  --  what shall we say , Dan ? " " You 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The truth , " repeated Adela quickly . " You mean that Dave died of an overdose of veronal ? That he died right in the next room while we were all here talking ? But people will say what Hilary says ! Everyonewill say he murdered Bayard and then killed himself . That it was a confession of his guilt . Ca n't you say something else ? Anything ? "  | " No , Adela . I 'm sorry . That is all I can say . " " But was n't it heart failure in the end ? Could n't you say that ? " Dr. Bouligny smiled sadly . " All deaths are heart failure in the end , Adela , " he said gently . " But I can say with honesty that it was a culmination of a long period of illness . Everyone knows that he has not been well in a long time . I 'll do what I can , I promise you . " It struck me that Hilary was a little eager to shift the blame onto Dave 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder once and for all . Impulsively , and thereby , I have no doubt , incurring Hilary 's undying hatred , I said : " If you left Bayard alive at ten minutes after four the afternoon of his death and your wife found him dead not more than ten minutes later at the most , it ' could not have been Dave who killed him . For Dave and Mr. Carick were together at that time . " The shock of Dave 's death had apparently driven from Hilary 's thoughts the moments immediately precedingits discovery . I could almost see him grope about in his memory , while his face hardened suspiciously . He darted a swift look toward Evelyn . " Bayard was alive when I left him , " he said stubbornly . " I do n't care what you have taken it in your head to say , Evelyn , he was alive when I left him . " " Evelyn , " said Adela slowly , " why did you say what you did ? Why did you say Bayard was alive when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There in the study ? " P219Evelyn 's dark blue eyes went from her husband 's worried , frightened face to Allen 's . I do n't know what she found there , some source of strength , I suppose , for she said bluntly : " I did n't tell the truth , Adela . You see , I knew that I lilary had just left Bayard . I never had liked Bayard , you all know that , so it was n't such a shock to find him dead as it might have been . Oh , it was terrible , of course , to find him like that , but it was n't as if it had been someone I loved . The dreadful part of it , to me , was the fact that Hilary , if he had kept his appointment with me , as I soon found he had , must have just left the house . I was afraid they had quarreled . I was afraid " She stopped , looking in some anxiety atHilary . " Oh , go on , " said Hilary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of murder . Do n't stop on my account . " Evelyn 's blue eyes looked troubled . But she was always impervious to even the broadest irony . To Evelyn people said what they meant . She continued at once and rather sensibly : " What else was there for me to think , Hilary ? Oh , I know now that you did n't kill him . But then I was afraid . I thought of everything . Of the boys . Of you . I knew how Bayard goaded you . Even a word or a look or a smile from Bayard could always enrageary --  " Evelyn , for God 's sake , stop , " groaned Hilary . " Stop her , Allen . Ca n't you see what she is doing " So I thought , " continued Evelyn inexorably , " thatI 'd better not tell that I found Bayard dead when Ip220came here to meet Hilary .. And Hilary agreed with me about it . He said there were times when a lie is -- Hilary was on his feet . " Evelyn , will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allen , crisply breaking through Hilary'sfrenzied protest , " you say you know now that Hilary did n't kill Bayard . How do you know it ? Do n't be frightened . " " I 'm not frightened , " said Evelyn calmly , and I 'm sure she spoke the truth . " I know Hilary did n't kill Bayard because he told me he did n't . " " Because I told -- Oh , my God , Evelyn , are you trying to make things worse than they are already ? " " Why , no , Hilary , " said Evelyn . " I 'm just telling the truth . I never felt right about that lie , but I told it after I 'd promised you I would . I could see why it was so necessary , but now the truth is out we may as well make the best -- I stepped forward . My uniform rustled in the suddensilence . I suppose they saw something in my face , for no one spoke , and I was conscious of their combinedgaze . " Did you close Bayard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " No . His eyes were closed when I found him . I was glad of that . His eyes were closed . " " His eyes were closed , " I repeated slowly . Dr. Boulignystarted to speak and checked himself . " The eyes of those who die a violent death do not close voluntarily . " I turned squarely to Hilary . " Did you close Bayard 's eyes ? " P221HILARY was , I really believe , an excellent and levelheadedman of business . It was only owing to the fact that Bayard 's murder so nearly concerned him that he found it so difficult to keep his head . Found it , in fact , impossible to behave with the assurance and foresight with which , in all likelihood , he would have advised his bank 's client . Perhaps , too , as Evelyn had hinted , he had become supersensitive to Bayard or anything connected with Bayard ; I myself had seen how easily and swiftly Bayard 's smiling , edged remarks could penetrate Hilary 's complacency . Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had worked for , everything he held dear was threatened . He had been under a protracted nervousstrain , he was harassed on all sides by worries , and Dave 's death was the final blow . My question was patently unwelcome . But then , almost anything I might have said would be unwelcome to Hilary . He gave me a harassed , quick look , fumbled for a cigarette , selected one with jerky fingers , and said : " No . No , I did n't close his eyes . How could I ? Bayardwas alive , I tell you , when I came here that afternoon . I 'm going to telephone to Frank Whiting right now , Adela . It wo n't do to wait . " P222He started for the study . Almost at the door he stopped suddenly , as if he could n't bear to see Dave 's body again , turned abruptly , and went to the hall . " That 's right , " said Dr. Bouligny . " Frank will have to be told sooner or later , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the long shadowed room that we could hear Hilary 's voice from the telephone in Adela 's morning room , and his footsteps back along the hall . He was wiping his face with his handkerchief when he entered the room again . " This is going to be bad , " he said . " Frank Whiting  --  well , he did n't say much , but I could feel what he thought . God , it 's such a mess ! " He dropped heavily into a chair and sat there , staring at the rug . " Is he coming right away ? " asked Dr. Bouligny . " Soon . He could n't come immediately . " I am never one to put my hand to the plow and look back . And I did not like Hilary 's evasion . " Someone , " I said , " closed Bayard 's eyes . And if Bayard was alive when you left the house that afternoon , Mr. Thatcher , and dead when your wife came so soon after and no one entered the house in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you mean by that ? " cried Hilary . " Are you accusing me of murder ? What business is it of yours ? " " Hilary , I asked Miss Keate to do exactly what she is doing . " It was Adela , of course , stiff and cold and straight and marvelously composed . " I think you would do well to answer the nurse , " said Allen dryly . " It is a reasonable question . ' YouP223see , Hilary , you do n't seem to realize that you are in a rather questionable position . You appear to be the last one known to have been with Bayard before his death . You say you did n't kill him , and we are only too ready to believe you . But Miss Keate , quite reasonably , wants further proof . " There was a short silence . It was so quiet I could hear Pansy , withdrawn to a corner and forgotten , panting asthmatically . Hilary continued to stare with narrowed eyes at the rug . Finally he said sulkily : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seem cowardly , but I think Dave did it . But I do n't know how it happened . " " Suppose we go at this in a more orderly way , " said Allen . He went to the table . There was a pad of paper there and a heavy bronze inkwell and pens . " Now then , Miss Keate , you were sitting out in the arbor all that afternoon . About what time did you go out there ? " " About two o'clock . I left Bayard resting in his own room . It was perhaps ten minutes after you and Dave Thatcher had left the house . " " And you say Higby was mowing the lawn ? " " Yes ; he had already started by the time I had reached the arbor . He did n't stop except very briefly , when he would turn a corner  --  so briefly as scarcely to be noted  --  during the whole afternoon . I could hear the lawnmower very plainly . " " That ought to let Higby out , then . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window and shoot Bayard simultaneously . Now , then , when you took up your somewhat observatory position in the arbor , who were still in the house ? " " Bayard , of course . And Emmeline . And Florric . " I hesitated . " And I was there , " said Janice at once . " And Adela . " " What time did you leave the house , Janice ? " " It must have been about twenty minutes to three . " She looked inquiringly at me . " Yes , " I agreed . " It was just two-thirty when Florrieleft . And you came out of the house not more than ten minutes later . " " Janice , where was Bayard when you left the house ? " His question was very gentle . " Bayard was there in Dave 's study . Alone , " said Janice steadily . " He must have come downstairs again as soon as Miss Keate left him . " " What was he doing ? " " Nothing in particular . " " Did you speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly , her dark eyes meeting Allen 's intent look . " But only for a moment . I only talked to him for a moment , and then I left the house . " " Two-forty , then , Janice leaves the house . Bayard is alive then . " Allen was making notes as he talked . " What happened next , Miss Keate ? " " I saw Bayard , " interposed Adela . " I came downstairsready to go to the Benevolent Aid Society . Bayardwas there at the door of the study , and I spoke to him a moment before I left . "   " Was he alone then , Adela ? " " Certainly . " " What time was that ? " " I do n't know exactly , " said Adela . " I think it was close to three o'clock . " " But , Adela , you did n't say you had spoken to Bayardjust before you left home , " said Evelyn in a puzzledway . " Did n't I ? " said Adela calmly . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was one of the last to see him alive . " I caught the flicker of her set blue gaze toward 1 lilary . " It was exactly three o'clock when Miss Thatcher left the house , " I said . " I happened to glance at my watch . And it was four o'clock when Mr. Thatcher arrived . And no one came near the house in the mean-time . " " You are sure of that ? " asked Allen . " You did n't drop into sleep during that time ? " " No , " I replied , so decidedly that he did not pursue the matter . " Then at four o'clock Hilary arrives . About how long were you in the house , Hilary ? " " Ten minutes , " I said , before I could check myself . I Iilary gave me a look of rage and nodded . " I suppose she is right , " he said . " It was probably ten minutes or so . I did n't realize , " he added bitterly , " that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hilary , " said Adela swiftly , " I asked Miss KeateP226to help me inquire into Bayard 's death . Please rememberthat . " Please remember , she might as well have said , that we must keep Miss Keate friendly to us . That we must convince her that no Thatcher has done murder . That we must answer every question she may wish to ask . Hilary mumbled something which sounded near enough to an apology , and Allen said rather hastily : " Four-ten , Hilary leaves . " His pen sputtered as he wrote it . " Then Evelyn arrives . " He looked questioninglyat me . " It was only a few moments after Mr. Thatcher left , " I said . " She must have actually entered the house at close to four-fifteen and left no later than four-twenty . " " Then , after Evelyn left , you saw no one until Janice and Adela returned together ? " " No one , " I said positively . " And Emmeline is perfectly sure that no one came near the back of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's arrival ? " " She is perfectly sure , " said Adela stiffly . That was to protect Dave , I thought to myself ; I began to won der what she would do with her burglar theory . Allen was frowning at the paper . " You are n't very helpful , Hilary , " he said . " Accordingto Miss Keate you were scarcely out of the house before Evelyn arrived . There 's at best only four or five minutes between the time when you say you left Bayard alive and Evelyn says she found him dead . " P227I looked at Hilary . We all looked at Hilary . Hilary , so fatally trapped in his own words . His plump face was pink and glistening . His eyes were frightened , evading our gaze , looking everywherebut at Allen . He got out his handkerchief and wiped his face again . He had not lighted the cigarette he had selected and had rolled it in his nervous fingers until it was limp and crushed and shedding small shreds of tobacco on his neat gray trousers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly : " You say you found him alive . You talked to him . Are you sure of that , Hilary ? Are you sure he was still alive when you left ? " " Allen ! " cried Evelyn in a shocked tone . She turnedLlquickly to her husband . " Hilary , they are blaming you for Bayard 's death . They are making you a murderer . I low can you talk like that , Allen ! You know Hilary did n't kill him . " " I do n't know anything about this until it is proved , Evelyn . I only know somebody certainly killed Bayard . And I think we 'd better have the truth . " The little pause gave Hilary time to rally . I suppose with desperation courage returned , and with it a measureof ingenuity . The wary , frightened look left his face , and he looked openly at Allen and at all of us . " I think you 're going off half-cocked , " he said . " And I 'd like to know who constituted you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor one , if you ask me . Look here . I 'm not the only one known to have been in this house with Bayard just before he was killed . Even aside from the burglar  --  and there mustp228have been a burglar , for the diamonds were certainly stolen  --  there were two other people , either one of whom had as much reason to kill him as I had . There was Higby . And there was Emmeline . " There was a short silence . Somehow I had been so certain that one of the Thatchers had killed Bayard that Emmeline 's possible culpability or Higby 's had not presented itself to me as a sensible line of inquiry . " But Higby , " I said out of my thoughts , and not quite realizing that I was speaking aloud and rather decidedly , " Higby was mowing the lawn all afternoon . I heard him . " Hilary looked at me scornfully . " If that 's his only alibi , it 's a poor one . " " But Emmeline said she kept an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along " Emmeline says , " said Hilary , as if that did n't mean much . " Everybody knows that Higby is as poor as a church mouse . And lazy into the bargain . What more likely than that he 's been planning to steal the diamondsfor months ? Everybody knows about them , probably everyone in town knows exactly where we keep them . Higby thought everyone was out of the house , fixed up some contrivance to keep the mower moving  --  he 's of a mechanical turn of mind , and could amount to something in that line if he was n't so good -- for-nothing -- he got into the study , stole the diamonds . Bayard was downstairs and caught Higby in the act , and Higby snatched up Dave 's revolver and shot Bayarddead . Then Higby went back to his lawn-mowing , the diamonds in his pocket or hidden in some safeP229place , and nobody even searched him . And there you are . " There was another rather curious silence ; I saw Evelyn give her husband an admiring but a rather puzzled look ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to have put aside for the moment the thought of Dave 's death and was watching I Iilary with wide , perplexed eyes . I could not tell what Allen or Dr. Bouligny thought of Hilary 's suddenly evolved theory . " How could he have got into the safe ? " asked Allen . Hilary shrugged his plump shoulders . " We did n't even keep it locked , half the time . It has always been so safe here in C . Anyway , it isan old-fashioned safe , even an amateur thief could open it , I should think . " " Why is Higby waiting around here , then ? Why does n't he get away ? " " That 's easy , " said Hilary . " He does n't want to attract suspicion . Mind you , " he went on , as if to be entirely just and fair . " I 'm not saying Higby did it . " " I hope not , " murmured Allen rather cynically . " There are too many holes in that notion . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove that by finding the diamonds on him . Or hidden by him . But he could have done it . You all know that . We ca n't say he did it without proof . But you ca n't say I did it without much more convincing proof than you have now . It is only circumstantial evidence against me now , and mighty slim evidence at that . I 'll notP230speak of the rather unusual matter of a man 's own family trying to make him out a murderer " " Hilary , " said Adela faintly . " We are not doing that . But Dave did n't kill Bayard . Dave could n't have killed him . I wo n't let Dave be thought Hilary continued . As he noted the effect of his words upon us he was becoming more natural , a bit pompous . " I 'll not talk of that , " he repeated , failing to reproachhis family for their lack of faith in him with a noble restraint which was a little too obvious to be exactly impressive . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here 's another point about Higby . Higby could easily have been bribed . " He paused to give his suggestion its due dramatic emphasis , and then went on , and this time even Allen looked as if he might consider the matter seriously . " Higby has never had enough money . He 's distinctly the get-rich-quick type ; he never wants to work and earn , he always hopes for some windfall . He 's not particularlydevoted to us ; there 's no reason why he should be . If a thief came along and offered him , say , five hundred dollars , a thousand even , to let him cross the lawn , get into the library windows , and to be silent about it afterward , do n't you think Higby would be tempted ? He might hesitate , but not for long . He 's weak and lazy . And it would have been such an easy way to get some money . Higby would be afraid to tell it once he found that Bayard had been killed . He would only know enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the afternoon . " He paused in barely veiled triumph . Adela lookedP231at him with the first shade of approval I had seen her offer him . " I must say , Hilary , " she said , " that is quite pos-sible . " Allen was drawing idle circles on the paper before him , his brown face enigmatic , and Dr. Bouligny looked mottled and uneasy . " I think , " said Dr. Bouligny , " the sooner we let this thing drop the better . Call it a burglar  --  as , of course , it was , " he interpolated swiftly as he met Adela 's cold gaze , " and forget it . " " Then , " said Hilary , without even looking at Dr. Bouligny , " here 's another possibility . Emmeline . " " Emmeline ! " cried Adela . " Hilary , you are mad . I would never be convinced that Emmeline would do such a thing . " " Emmeline , " repeated Hilary firmly . " She was out in the summer kitchen the entire afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few steps from the back door of the house . It seems to me that she insiststhat she never left that window a bit too fervently . Why should she be so determined that we should believethat --  " Emmeline is always determined , " said Adela , but Hilary swept on . " She could have entered the house and shot Bayard as easily as not . And she could have done it during those few moments between my departure and Evelyn 's a rival . " " But the motive , " said Allen , still drawing circles on the paper and not looking up .   " Motive ? " Hilary made an expansive gesture with his fat pink hands . " The motive is the most convincing thing about it . Emmeline knows all the family affairs . She can hardly help knowing . She 's not so deaf as she seems to be , and besides , she has been with us for years . To all practical purposes she is one of the family . She is devoted to Adela and to Dave . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble and anxiety Bayard has always been . She must have known of his frequent demands for money , threatening all kinds of things , making Adela 's life hell . Emmeline is direct , blunt , has no qualms about anything she considers her duty . Besides , she has a strong religious bias . " " But that , " said Evelyn in a bewildered way , " would keep her from  --  " she shivered a little and said  --  " murder , " in a muffled voice . " No . " Hilary shook his head . " No . It has often occurred to me that Emmeline 's religion has a strongly hysterical flavor . You know yourself how emotional she is . " " Emmeline , " said Janice incredulously , " emo-tional ! " " Certainly , " said Hilary . There was just the faintestair of a savant , instructing . " Certainly . Do n't you remember the old-time revival meetings , Adela ? How regularly Emmeline was converted ? How she wept ? How she sang ? How she went around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any real old-time revivals for years now ; probably she 's missed them " Hilary , " interrupted Adela , " you are preposterous . Are you seriously intimating that EmmelineP233Bayard because she did n't get to go to a revival meetingthis winter ? " " Certainly not , Adela . You just do n't understand these things . Is n't what I 've suggested possible , Dan ? " Dr. Bouligny looked up slowly and shook his great head rather sadly . " Hilary , " he said , " I 've doctored Thatcher county for thirty years . I 've brought over eight hundred babies into the world . I 've waited at practically every deathbedin the county . I 've dosed my people and I 've listened to their troubles as if they were so many children . I am old-fashioned , I know . But I do n't know what you are talking about . " " Look here , Dan , you 'll admit that you remember Emmeline 's fervent love for revivals ? " The doctor smiled faintly . " Yes . Nobody could get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going on . And then she 'd turn around and threaten us all with hell-fire and tell us we were lost . Remember , Adela ? " " It was very trying , " admitted Adela , " but nothing to do with this . " " Wait , Adela . It proves that Emmeline has a very fervid emotional nature , does n't it ? " " It proves she was a fool , " said Adela . " But go on . " " Well , all that emotionalism , tangled up with religionand duty and hell-fire , has been denied any outletfor years . Now then , suppose Emmeline gets it into her head that Bayard was threatening the peace and welfare of this family . Her family . Not only the welfarebut the family itself . Suppose she gets it into her head that she ought to remove him . Those religiously and emotionally warped natures get crazy notions and " " You are talking as if you thought Emmeline was crazy , " said Adela tartly . " You sound nearer it yourself , Hilary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already shot Bayard once and had wounded his " Hilary stoppedso suddenly he nearly choked himself and looked at me . " Go right ahead , " I said coolly . " I 've known that Dave fired the shot that wounded Bayard 's shoulder for some time . " Hilary 's look sharpened to suspicion , but he did not stop to discover the source of my information . Which was just as well . He went on : " She was always devoted to Dave . Loved him more than the rest of the family put together . Like you , Adela . If Emmeline thought Dave was determined to kill Bayard , do n't you think she 'd rather do the murderherself than let Dave do it ? She would far rather martyr herself than let Dave kill him . She --  " Anotherthought seemed to strike Hilary . He stopped , considered it , and added thoughtfully and in a meditativetone far different to the pompous voice in which he 'd been addressing us , " For that matter , if Emmelinesaw Dave coming into the house that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " " There you go again , Hilary , accusing your brother of murder . Dave  --  so recently dead  --  you might at least wait " Adela 's thick white hands clenchedP235tightly about the shining blue beads . " Your theory that Higby might have been bribed is your only contribution to our problem . I think that quite possible . He will never admit it , but it is quite possible that that is the way the thief got into the house . And there was a thief , of course ; all this talk of Emmeline and Dave and Hilary is absurd . There was a thief . And he stole our diamonds . And he killed Bayard . " I had heard enough talk of the thief and the diamonds . Enough and too much . I said wearily : " There was no thief . Nobody stole the diamonds . They are in the house . Hidden . " P236THE long room held only silence and eyes looking at me . Everyone was looking at me , and no one spoke . The silence grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were some entangling , impenetrable blanket laid fold on fold all about me . As it deepened and prolonged itself , as I met that combined gaze , I began to regret my rash words . After all , what business was it of mine ? Why had n't I continued to keep a discreet silence on that delicate point ? Why had I ever come to that house ? And above all , once having got there , why had I remained ? Why had I not taken to my heels , willy-nilly ? In what moment of mental aberration had I permitted myself to be persuaded to remain ? Even Janice 's dark eyes were unfriendly ; unfriendly and frightened . And Evelyn gave me a long and singularlycold and penetrating look before her eyes went in a significant and communicative way to Adela , who returned the glance . But it was Hilary who burst into speech , who finally broke that sinister silence . His words , however , were not calculated to make me easier in my mind . For he shouted : " Arrest that woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he repeated furiously : " Arrest her . Call Strove . She knows where the diamondsare . She was here with no one to watch her the afternoon Bayard was killed . She killed him herself . She took the diamonds . And now she 's trying to blackmailus . She thinks she 'll have an income for life from us . Arrest her -- By this time Dr. Bouligny had got heavily to his feet . " Hilary , stop shouting like that . You are out of your head . Stop telling us to arrest her . For one thing we ca n't . And Jim Strove is n't here to do it . And for another thing , " concluded Dr. Bouligny a little wearily , " she did n't murder Bayard . You are making a fool of yourself . " Hilary , quite purple , whirled to Allen . " She 's guilty . It 's as plain as the nose on your face . She killed Bayard . She " Allen had risen and had taken Hilary by the arm . He said something , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hilary lapsed rather suddenly into a red and volcanic silence from which one felt he might erupt at any moment , and Allen turned to me . " What , exactly , do you mean , Miss Keate ? That is an extraordinary statement to make . " " I mean , " I said , wishing I had bitten out my tongue long before it had behaved with such alarming indiscretion , " I mean that the diamonds were never stolen . They are upstairs . " " Where are they hidden ? How long have you known this ? "  | Well , I told them . I told them just as F'lorrie had told it to me . I added rather lamely , my eyes on Janice'ssuddenly stricken face , that it may have been merely servant 's gossip . But it was n't . The diamonds were still in that jar of green bath salts in Janice 's shining little bathroom with its water lilies and pale green frogs . Evelyn and Allen and Janice went to see , and returnedafter only a few moments of silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Someone spread a newspaper on the table and pushed the rose bowl aside , and I think we all held our breath while Evelyn 's firm brown hands pulled the stopper from the large crystal jar and let the shower of green rattle softly on the paper . All of us , clustered around that table , saw the first jewel come out  --  it was the sunburst brooch Adela had talked of  --  and I think we all gasped as it caught a light from the window and glittered and shone like a live thing . The others came out , too . Hilary counted in a husky whisper and reached for each one avidly , as if someone might snatch it from him . It had grown late during that feverish talk , but no one realized that it was dusk in the long , old room until Allen reached out to the shaded table lamp and snappedon the electric light in order to see the diamonds more distinctly . In my memory his turning on the light is the period to that strange and terrible afternoon : not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whiting 's arrival , nor Janice 's slow turning toward the door of the study as if , for the moment , her thought had been driven away fromp239Dave 's death and that now she must return to sorrow and regret and tragedy . For Hilary had scarcely said in a relieved way , " Well , they are all here , every one of them , " when Emmeline , followed by Frank Whiting  --  intense curiosityback of the tactfully sober look in his face  --  appeared in the doorway . And I gave the faces about that table , all thrown into bright relief by the table lamp , a last searching look . No one had admitted hiding the diamonds . And not one face revealed any previous knowledge of the whereabouts of the jewels ; I could not point to anyone there and say : This face shows guilt ; this one shows no surprise ; this one shows fear lest it be detected . Then Emmeline was advancing , horrified question in her face , and Adela was turning bleak blue eyes rather helplessly to Evelyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Evelyn . " She does n't know why Frank Whiting is here . " She looked puzzled , as if it seemed strange to her that all the world did not know of Dave 's death . " Emmeline does n't know . I must tell her " Go on up to your room , Adela , " said Dr. Bouligny , stepping forward . " 1 ' 11 see to things . This way , Frank . " I followed Evelyn and Adela . At the door I glanced back to see Hilary carefully recounting and sorting the diamonds which made bright sparkles of iridescent light in his fingers . Dr. Bouligny and Frank Whiting disappeared into Dave 's study . Janice had dropped into a chair near the window , and Allen was standing beside her , looking at the bent dark head as if lie longed to take her into his arms and comfort her sadness . The patch of pale green crystals on the table sparkled softly in the light . Outside , the shadows had grown long , and the soft summer night was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her face was stiff and unnatural , and she stared straight ahead as if she saw nothing but perhaps a memory of Dave 's face . It might be true , what Hilary had said . It might be true that Emmeline had loved Dave more than any of them . I felt an impulse of pity for the gaunt dark woman , and I stepped toward her , about to speak , although I do n't know what I could have said . But she brushed past as if she did n't see me . Bayard 's death had been , as far as possible , ignored . Dave 's death disrupted the household . It did more than that . It brought things to their climax . It could not be ignored . It could not be thrust for one moment out of our consciousness . Hilary , so determined to prove it was a suicide , Adela , equally determined to prove it was no suicide , between them pushed things on to that strange and unexpected end . If either had been content to let things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stood there at the foot of the stairway for a moment , looking up its polished length  --  rather dark since no one had thought to turn on the hall light  --  striving to reorient myself , so to speak . So much had happened since I had come down thosep241stairs at Adela 's request to meet her in the library . Was it only a few hours ago that Mrs. Steadway had called ? That Adela had begun her amazing inquiry ? That I had left Florrie sitting up in her ugly silk dressinggown ? Since then Dave had died . Evelyn had admitted that she had found Bayard dead , Hilary had been all too ready to say that Dave had killed him , Dave had been discovered to be a veronal addict and had at last died of the drug  --  and I was no nearer knowing who had actually murdered Bayard than I ever was . And death and tragedy and the horror of suspicion had again visited that shadowed , spacious old house . Florrie was still sitting up . Her boasted second sight must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stirringevents that had been taking place downstairs and , I 'm sure , knew nothing of them . I stayed with her only a moment , to be sure she was all right , and then returnedslowly to the lower hall . I reached it in time to see the ambulance , gray and ghostly in the dusk , drive carefully away . Hilary and Allen and Dr. Bouligny had apparently helped carry the stretcher , and they turned toward the house again , walking slowly across the smooth lawn . Hilary was brushing the back of his hand across his eyes , and Allen had thrown one arm over Hilary 's shoulders , and Dr. Bouligny , a little behind , walked slowly and heavily , his head bent wearilyand his body sagging as if the Thatcher burdens were too heavy for him . Well , somehow we got through the dreadful night . P242It was that night that I had my momentous talk with Janice : a weary , ineffably saddened Janice who was only a slender shape with a pale face and dusky hair in the shadows of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house about ten , as much to escape the horror and death and fear that lurked in every shadow of the silent house , as to seek my ostensible objective , fresh air and exercise . Adela and Evelyn had disappeared ; Hilary and Allen and Dr. Bouligny were in the library , smoking innumerable cigarettes and , in the glimpse I had from the hall , talking not at all . I did not know that Janice , too , had taken refuge in the friendly , fragrant shadows of the rose garden until I met her face to face when I rounded a curve in the silent , dark path . The moon was barely touch- ; ng the trees , and the shadows were still dense , and I think we were both startled  --  indeed , rather frightenedjust for an instant  --  until we recognized each other . Then she said , " Oh , it 's you , Miss Keate , " with a kind of sob in her throat . I have never known exactly how we began to talk or why she confided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to someone . But I remember very well how we sat on the curved stone bench just in front of a rose tree that hung out and over our heads and made the soft dusk sweet with its fragrance , how white her dress and face looked , and how her hair seemed to blend imperceptibly with the shadows , and how , presently , the moonlight began to stretch gently along theP243path before us and then gradually to touch the tips of her white slippers . I believe she began to speak of Dave , for I remember that she asked me a number of questions about veronal and the effects of the drug when taken as a habit . I answered as far as I could . " His death , then , was peaceful , " she said at last . And when I told her yes , that he had died in his sleep , she seemed a little relieved . " He looked peaceful , " she said , as if to herself . " So peaceful that one might almost envy him . " And as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , no , I did n't mean that , of course . One never really means that . But it has been a dreadful , dreadful time , Miss Ideate . I should never want to live these days over again . I wonder if ever in my life I shall be able to forget them . Forget any of it "  --  she paused and added in a low voice which held a note of horror which gave me suddenly a measure of the nightmare her days and nights had been since Bayard 's death  --  " forget Bayard 's blood on my hand . " She lifted her hand as if to see whether , even in the shadows , the stain still was visible , and I reached out and took the slim white blur in my own clasp . Her fingers were cold and clung to mine as those of a child caught in some bad dream might cling . And all at once she was telling me what happened . " I moved Bayard . I moved him . He was in the study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the desk . I did n't know what to do . All I thought was that he must not be found there in Dave 's study . We all knew that Dave had tried once before to kill him ; had actually shot at him and Bayard 's shoulder was wounded . That 's when you came . I knew , too , that I had no time ; that Adela would be coming into the house in just a moment or two . I had glanced into the library as I was about to pass the door ; I saw the study door open and went to look to see if Dave was there , and there was Bayard . Dead , on the rug . " She took a long tremulous breath and almost visibly steadied herself . " It took only a second to be sure he was dead . And I thought , He must not be found here in Dave 's study . The room that is Dave 's . He must not be found here . ' So I  --  I set the baskets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drag him  --  drag him , hold him by the arms and drag him out of the study and into the library . It was terribly difficult . And I had to hurry . I got as far as that table , and I left him there on the floor , and I ran back and straightened the rugs that had been pulled up and took the baskets and ran to the kitchen and left them there . I did n't know what was on my hand until I had reached my own room . I do n't remember why I took off my hat ; habit , I suppose . But I looked at it and saw the stain . And just then Emmeline , downstairs , began to scream , and I knew she had found Bayard . I hid the hat and washed my hand and ran down the front stairs . And there you all were in the library . " She shuddered and stopped . " You 'll feel better now , " I said . " It is a good thing to talk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got into the house somehow and  --  shot Bayard . " " I do n't know , " she said . " I do n't know . I do n't want to know . " " Did n't you say Bayard was downstairs when you left the house early in the afternoon and that you spoke to him ? " " Yes . He was downstairs . I had gone to the kitchen to get the baskets for the eggs and butter , and I thought I would take Mrs. Steadway some flowers . I stopped in the library to get some scissors I had accidentallyleft there that morning , and Bayard was there . " " Did Dave keep the door to his study locked ? " " Not as a rule . It was a set rule in the household , you see , that he was not to be disturbed . There was no need to lock the door . " " And you spoke to Bayard ? " " Yes . But only a word or two . Not , " said Janice , " a pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decide what we would do about the letter . My letter . I took the scissors and put them in my basket and left . I was nearly frantic , but there was nothing I could do . Bayard thought that in the end Allen would give him the money he wanted in order to protect me , and I suppose Allen would have done just that , but I so hoped we could discover a way out of it without that . " " But if Dave killed Bayard , what about the dia-monds ? " " I do n't know . I do n't understand about the dia- monds . But I think that someone in the family put them in that jar of bath salts merely because they would be thought tobe quite safe there . It would have to be someone who knew I do n't use bath salts . " " You do n't think , then , that it was a deliberate attempt to make it look as though you had taken the diamonds ? " I could feel her astonishment . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why should anyone do that ? There would be no point in my taking the family diamonds . Many of them were to come to Dave 's wife anyway  --  were , in fact , already mine . Oh , no , it was n't that . I think  --  perhaps I ought not to tell you this , Miss Keate , but I think that Adela or Evelyn somehow managed to get the diamonds out of the safe merely to give an appearance of burglary . I know , " she said sadly , " that we all feared Dave had killed Bayard and tried to shield him . " " What were the circumstances of Dave 's first attackupon Bayard ? You told me you did n't know why they quarreled , but ca n't you think of anything that might have caused trouble between them ? " " I did n't know when I talked to you before , Miss Keate , but now I believe I know . I think Bayard was supplying Dave with veronal . The drug is hard to get in this state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked better than to ruin Dave  --  or Hilary , or both . He 's always hated them . I suppose he was jealous of them . Or perhaps the whole thing dated back to something in their childhood . And Bayard was thoroughly bad . He was unbelievably bad . "   " Why do you think Bayard was supplying Dave with veronal ? " " I 'm not sure that he was . I only heard a few words of their quarrel . But there 's nothing else they could have quarreled so dreadfully about . Dave has n't been well in a long time , and lately he 's been growing more and more unlike himself . Of course , Adela and I knew , though we never talked of it , that he was taking some drug . I thought it was morphine , though I could never he sure . We did everything we could to distract and amuse him . We watched him so carefully . We tried everything . It 's been rather bad here for the last two years , Miss Keate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment before she continued sadly : " I do n't know whether Hilary knew or not . It was nothing we liked openly to discuss . I suspected Bayard , but not for any definite reasons ; it was a sort of instinct . I dreaded his visits here . But when Florrie tookveronal by mistake , and you said you had had no veronal , and I knew that Bayard had hidden my letter in your bag , I felt sure that he had also hidden the veronal in your bag . He had had access to it , and he would know it was not safe to keep the drug openly about the room while he was ill . If he was furnishing veronal to Dave he would undoubtedly ask a large price for it . What more likely than that he asked more than Dave would pay ? Or held back a supply of the drug ? If poor Dave was like drug addicts usually are , he would be frantic for it . That 's my explanation for Dave 's frenzied quarrel with Bayard . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poor Dave  --  he must have hated himself , and he must have hated Bayard for the hold he had . Do you think I am right ? " " It sounds quite likely that Bayard supplied him with veronal , " I said . " And if Bayard hid your letterin my bag , which is the only reasonable thing to suppose , he could easily have hidden the veronal he had with him in the same place . He would think it a safe place in case anyone searched his room . But , of course , if this has been going on for two years or more , they must have had some systematic system of supply . Just what happened the night Bayard was shot and Dr. Bouligny called me ? " " I do n't know exactly . They were in Bayard 's room , Dave and Bayard . I could n't sleep that night , and I had heard Dave moving about in his room and the door into the hall closing as I supposed he left the room . In a short time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then leave again . He seemed hurried , and I do n't know why I immediately thought he 'd come back for his revolver . But that 's what I thought , and I hurried out of bed and after him . It had taken me a moment to get into a dressing gown and slippers , and Dave was already in Bayard 's room when I reached the hall . Adela must have been awake , too , for just as I passed her door it opened , and she came out , and before we had time to speak we heard Again she steadied herself . " We heard a revolver shot . It was so loud  --  I ca n't tell you how dreadful it was . We ran to Bayard 's room , and Dave was standing there aiming the revol/ver again , and Bayard was swearing terribly and had his hand over his shoulder , and it was bleeding all on his pajama coat . And Dave looked white and dazed , as if he did n't know what he was doing . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm and I managed to get the revolver away from him and out of sight while Adela talked to him . When I came back Dave was beginning to look less queer , and Adela took him to his room , and I looked at Bayard 's shoulder and put cold water on it , and by that time Emmeline and Florrie were in the hall , and Adela was back , and she told them what we told everyone . That Bayard had had an accident . It was foolish , of course , but we could n't say Dave shot him . Adela sent Florrie to telephone to Dr. Dan , and he came right away and dressed the wound and said Bayard would recover . That he was not seriously wounded . What a relief that was ! " " But did n't Dave explain why he had tried to kill Bayard ? " " No . No . He said nothing . That made it worse , somehow . You must have seen how frightened Adela and I were . We were desperately afraid Dave would attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act as if there was nothing . We tried to keep the two men apart . Adela insisted on a nurse coming in the hope t hat she would  --  that your presence would in a measure protect Bayard . And thus protect Dave ; it was Dave we cared for . Poor Dave . " She sighed , and after a moment said thoughtfully : " I was very young , you know , when I married . I  | did n't know . I did n't know anything about love . I did n't know " She paused , her face turned a little away fro me as if the darkness were kind to her . The moonlight lay , by that time , white on the roses , and the fragrancwasheavy and sweet , and the shadow over the benc black and soft and cool . Janice said in a voice that wa not steady : " You are very good to me , Miss Keate . " " I ? Nonsense 1 " I said brusquely . And repeated , " Nonsense I " She moved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is there anything else , Miss Keate ? I want you t. know the whole truth . " Well , yes , there is , " I said promptly . " There ar several things , in fact . It was you who tried to ente Bayard 's room from the hall that first night I wa here , was n't it ? You tried the doorknob , and while I was unlocking the door returned to your room and watched me in the mirror ? " " Yes , " she admitted at once . " I did n't think Bayar. would need night care , so I supposed you were in you own room . I hoped , of course , that I could get into th room and by some lucky chance discover my letter while Bayard was asleep . I knew that Dr. Dan must hav given him a bromide , and I thought there might b some small chance of my success . I was desperate , o I would n't have tried . " " Who then was on the balcony that night ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bal. cony ? "  |p251I  did not explain . At a sudden memory I said : " Had the dog followed you to Bayard 's door ? I thought I heard a sort of panting sound . Like a dog on a hot day . " " Yes , " said Janice and added , " It was rather horrible , was n't it ? I felt so furtive . Stealthy . Ashamed . t seemed to me even Pansy must know what I was . Ding and why . " The moonlight was so clear on us then that I could ec her face quite definitely . Her lovely sad face , and er slender white arms , and the soft outlines of herfrock . She was twisting a fold of the white silk nervouslyin her fingers , twisting and folding it tightly . I watched her idly for a moment . Then I jumped to my feet . A new and amazing theory had flashed into my mind . That piece of tightly folded paper that I had found on the Sarouk rug there in Dave 's study  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Could it possibly mean what I thought it might mean ?  |p252JANICE  murmured something in surprise at my abrupt motion , and I suppose I replied . I do n't know what I said , for I was only anxious to get to my room . I left her sitting there among the roses , with the moonlight soft on her beauty . As I reached the lawn I met Allen . He looked grave but very tall and cool and resourceful , and his eyes were shining . As I emerged from the shadows of the shrubbery he said quickly and eagerly : " Is it you " and in a different tone , " Oh , Miss Keate . I caught the flash of your white skirt there in the shadow . I thought  --  " he stopped abruptly , and I did something that , considering the circumstances , was in very bad taste . I said , " She 's in the rose garden , " and walked rapidly toward the house . I had no romantic notion that Janice and Allen would fall promptly into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could not have failed to realize what Dave 's death meant to them . But Janice was a sensitive woman ; she had temperament and pride . All Allen could do then was give her the comfort of his presence ; talk to her of the things that must be done ; love her and protect her and try to shield her . In my unwontedly tender mood I found myself strollingwith slower and slower steps across the moonlitp253lawn , thinking of the two in the rose garden and of the soft dusky shadows and of what they might be saying and feeling . Once at the door , however , I walked hurriedly through the still , polished spaces of the hall , up the dim stairway with its gleaming handrail , and toward my own room . As I passed Adela 's door it opened and Dr. Bouligny emerged . " Ah , Miss Keate , " he said . " We have finally got Miss Thatcher to sleep . I think she 'll rest all night , but you 'd better take your room next to hers here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've left a sedativeif she needs it . Florrie is quite recovered ; I just went up to see her ; she can be up and about her work tomorrow . " I assented and watched his thick figure move along the hall toward the stairway . He looked old and weary ; his shoulders were stooped , and his body sagged , and he went slowly down the stairs . I turned into my own room . Owing to the delay there had been about getting my supply of fresh uniforms the wrinkled and soiled uniformsI had worn had still not been sent down to be laundered . I hunted feverishly among them , diving into the pockets rapidly , and in only a moment or two found what I sought , the little tightly folded piece of paper I had picked up there in the study immediately after we had found Bayard dead . Adela had been telephoning , I remembered . And I remembered , too , how she had first asked me to telephonefor the doctor and then had changed her mindp254suddenly and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed her into the small room and had picked up almost at her feet that tiny folded paper . There was one way to attempt a proof of the amazingexplanation that had occurred to me . I glanced at my watch . It was something afte eleven , and the house had been very silent when I cam upstairs . In all probability I could do what I wishes to do without being seen , and an inner voice cautioned me that it would not be well for me to be seen . I waited for a long time . I heard Janice 's light ste. go past my door . I thought I heard Evelyn 's voice . speaking to Hilary and his reply before another doo closed with a decisiveness which led me to think tha Evelyn 's hand had propelled it . I waited until the moo was high and white and the whole house had sunk int . complete stillness  --  as complete a silence as if then : were not another living soul besides myself in its dark wide old walls . When I finally ventured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent gleaming spaces of the hall , the rustle of my uniform sounded loud and sharp through the stillness . I felt uneasy , as if eyes were watching me from some place , and it was difficult to plunge into the dark stair well . And yet I was going on no errand of positive danger . I was not , I certainly ' hoped , going to meet Bayard 's murderer . I was only going to the telephone in Dave 's study . The lower hall was as usual dimly lighted , but the drawing rooms , so peaceful by day , were by night great black caverns , and at the door of the library I hesi/tated . It was all so silent . So black . The room so large . And over there by the table we had found Bayard 's body . I sought for but did not find the button which would turn on the electric light . Finally , my eyes becoming more accustomed to the darkness , and finding that the reflected moonlight from the white lawn actually served faintly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to find the light and groped my way across to the study door . The furniture along the way loomed up dimly black and solid , and I felt , absurdly perhaps , that almost any dreadful thing might be crouching behind the davenport or in the shadow of the great leather chairs , or even behind the carved oak screen at the fireplace . But I did reach the study door , opened it , and entered . There I had no difficulty in discovering the light switch , although a moment of panic caught me and brought my heart pounding to my throat as I brushed against the foot of the couch where Dave 's body had lain . The desk light , shaded with green , sprang into view and lighted softly the small room . The telephone stood beside it on the desk . I took a long breath . A moment more , and my errand would be accomplished , and I would be free to take to my heels if I wished and fly from those horrorladenshadows . I took the tightly folded paper from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbed moment or two I straightened up . I did not know whether I felt sad or triumphant . But I did know the truth about the telephone . The instrument was an old-fashioned desk set , with a mouthpiece on a standard and a separate receiver which hangs on its hook when the telephone is not in use and which , on being lifted , automatically connects the telephone . That tightly folded wad of paper fitted exactly into the narrow slot along which the hook , moves up and down . I sank into a chair near the desk and sat there starve ing at the telephone . I inserted the paper above the  --  , ' hook and took down the receiver as if about to telephone , and there was , of course , no connection : I might dial as long as I liked and get no one . I inserted the paper below the hook ; the receiver might , in that case , be left on the hook , but , since itwas an automatic telephone , anyone might call that number indefinitely and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study , following Adela , just after the discovery of Bayard 's death , she had been using the telephone , and the wad of paper was at my feet . And I had heard from Janice and Evelyn no. mention at all of the telephone ; they had not said that Bayard had the telephone in his hand ; had not , in the shock of discovery , appeared to have so much as looked at the telephone . There was only one thing that was clear in my mind , but it was highly significant . And that was that Adela'stelephone conversation with Bayard  --  which , in my mind , and I 'm sure in others , had gone so far to establish a conviction that Bayard had been murderedp257after Adela and Janice had left the house  --  might possibly have been no conversation at all . I had heard the telephone ring , it is true , and I had so distinctly heard it break off in the middle of one of its peals that I was sure someone had answered it . But a child would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been suddenly broken , the bell of this telephone would instantaneously stop ringing . If that folded piece of paper meant what I thought it meant , Adela 's story of the telephone conversation with Bayard after every one of the Thatchers was out of the house meant precisely nothing . Or , rather , it meant that Bayard was dead before Adela left the house . Before Adela , dad in her dainty lavender frock with her eyeglasses dangling from their ribbon and her parasol carefully lifted to shield her from the sun , had walked composedly along the broad turf path on her way to the Benevolent Aid Society . It was not possible . It was not , I repeated to myself , possible . But if it were true we must reconstruct the whole story of the crime . In the first place , it automatically released Hilary from suspicion . But then , if Bayard was already dead when Adela left the house that afternoonand she had arranged that contrivance on the telephone  --  what did that mean ? I leaned my head on my hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rug . The rug which still bore , hidden in its thick nap and concealed by the small , tightly interwovenfigures , the stain of Bayard 's blood . If Bayard was dead when Adela left the house that afternoon , the field of suspects was thereby still more limited . With my own eyes I had seen Allen and Dave leave the house . Bayard had sent me to the arbor . Only Janice and Adela were in the house with him . And Florrie . Florrie . But Florrie had left the house before Janice came out of it with her baskets over her armsand her small white hat on her head , and from ' . ' Janice 's story , as I had heard it that night , I had received a distinct impression that Janice had come directly from her brief and unpleasant interview with Bayard out of the house , into the garden to cut the flowers for Mrs. Steadway , and thence to the garage and away . If Janice had come directly from Bayard she had talked to him after Florrie had left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were always to be included among that extremely short list of possible suspects , but in spite of Hilary 's spirited and rather ingenuous defense of himself that very afternoon  --  a defense which , of course , was based upon the possible guilt of either Emmeline or Higby  --  I did not feel that either of the two was guilty . The small incident of the silver spoon on the floor of the library , upside down with a sticky little pool of purple jelly under it , went a long way in my mind toward proving Emmeline 's innocence of the crime . It was too trivial a thing to have been deliberately evolved ; if Emmeline ' had been set upon proving her innocence of Bayard 's death she would have arrived at some far more ambitiousa plan . I was equally reluctant to suspect Higby ; it wasP259barely possible that he had arranged some highly unusualand ingenuous method by which to keep the lawnmower running while he crawled into the library windows , entered Dave 's study , and shot Bayard with Dave 's revolver  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?  --  but since the diamonds had not been stolen at all , what could have been Higby 's purpose ? With the memory of that monotonous whir of the lawnmower in my mind I did not think it a likely solution . Besides , the little I had seen of Higby did not lead me to believe that he could , by any stretch of the imagination , accomplish any undertaking which involvedmuch use of brain cells . But by excluding Florrie , Higby , and Emmeline , and granting which was only supposition , after all that the telephone incident was as I reasoned it to be , only Adela and Janice were left as possible suspects . And while I could readily have believed that Adela would undertake almost any subterfuge in order to turn suspicionfrom her family , or any task to protect and further their interests , still I could scarcely suspect her of out-and-out murder . And Janice , to me at least , was equally inculpable . But what , exactly , had been done with that tightly folded piece of paper and why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end could have been accomplished without plugging the slot of the telephonehook . Perhaps Adela had wanted to leave the telephone there , with the receiver off the hook as if Bayard was in the very act of telephoning when he was killed ; yes , that might easily have been the way ofp260it . If Bayard was actually dead before Adela left the house , and she knew it and wished it to look as though he 'd been killed after every member of her family wai safely out of the house , she might have done exactly that . Then her story of the telephone conversation ( which , no doubt , she had taken care the druggist should hear ) would be even more convincing if Bayard were found with the telephone as if he had been talkingthrough it . It would be , in fact , all but conclusive as an alibi for her family . But Bayard had not been found there on the rug in the study with the receiver off the hook of the telephoneand the instrument perhaps near his hand . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . Janice had moved him . Janice , her slender muscles pulling with all their strength , her white hands ' reddened by their grisly task , had pulled that shattered body across the library floor . And Evelyn had see Bayard dead in the study . And , if my surmise was ' correct , Hilary , too , had been in Dave 's study while Bayard lay dead on the rug . Any of them might have picked up that telephone and replaced it . And the train of supposition which I had built from that tiny wad of paper might be entirely wrong . I sighed wearily and took the paper in my fingers and looked at it again and at that very instant heard a rustle back of me . I find I can not adequately describe my feelings as sat there in that small study , my back to the dark door of the cavernous library , and realized that someone stood in that doorway watching me . Had been watch  --  P261ing me perhaps while I fitted that damning piece of paper into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths in that small room . One death had been a murder . The other death had been so nearly induced by that sad and tragic train of circumstances that in its fundamentals it was murder , too . Deaths go in threes . Deaths go in threes . It is an old superstition and an unreasonable one . But it has more than a little element of truth in it . I have seen it happen more times in my nursing career than I cared , at that moment , to recall . Who stood there behind me ? I could not turn . I could not breathe . Was it Adela , Hilary , Evelyn , Janice ? Might it ' be , even , Allen ? Or Emmeline ? It was strange that , though I felt no fear of any one of those people , at the same time I felt a very definite and terrifying fear of whoever it was in the doorway . I suppose that paralyzing feeling of terror was owing to some sixth sense ; some deeply primitive warning of danger . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " Do n't move . I 'll shoot . " It was Hilary 's voice . But a Hilary I had not known before . Perhaps it is unnecessary to state that I did not move . Indeed , I sat so still that the very beating of my heart seemed for the moment suspended . And it is as well that I did so . For Hilary advanced from behind me and stepped just in the circle of light cast by the green-shaded desk lamp , and I saw that he held a revolverin his hand . And his hand was not very steady . And the revolver was aimed directly at me . His hair was disheveled , his eyes red and bloodshot , his face pale and puffy , and he wore a dark dressing , gown . I never knew how long he had watched me , nor how he had happened to follow me to the study . His ' voice too , was unnatural ; husky and threatening . " What are you doing here , when the whole house . hold is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous hands caressed the revolver . " Nothing , " I said . " Nothing . " " Answer me l You had some purpose here . " The bit of folded paper rolled from my numb fin- , gers , and his quick eyes caught it . I decided rapidly on a half truth . " I found that piece of folded paper here on the rug ' just after Bayard 's death , " I said rather weakly . " I ' came to try to discover whether or not it was a clue ; ; to the murderer . " His eyes wavered . I felt sure he had not seen the paper before and had no idea as to its possible significance . " And what did you discover ? " he asked in an unpleasantway . " Nothing . " And as I thought he looked faintly undecidedas to whether or not to believe me , I added nervously , " Do n't you want to put the revolver down ? Is it Dave 's gun ? "  |p263He  glanced then at the revolver , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me . " I do n't believe you , " he said . " But if you 'll keep quiet I wo n't shoot . " As a matter of fact , I am inclined to think I was rather nearer an abrupt and complete end than is exactly pleasant to recall , much less experience , during those few moments while Hilary 's unsteady fingers touched that revolver . He did not , I am sure , think that it would better conditions to dispose of me in such a manner ; he could n't have meant cold-bloodedly to shoot ; but he was in a frame of mind not to know exactly what he was ' doing . Perhaps my rather obvious and certainly acute discomfort recalled him to himself . He put down the revolver , looked at it rather strangely , said in an absent way , " Yes , it 's Dave 's gun . It 's the only one in the house , " and then went on with an abrupt change of tone : " Look here , Miss Keate . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's murder , or what you do n't know . But I 'm going to put my cards flat on the table , face up . I 'm not by any means a rich man . But I 'll give you ten thousand dollars in cash to leave this house tomorrow morning and forget you 've ever been here . " Afterward I was glad the interruption came before I could find my voice . Otherwise I would have said far too much , and the revolver was still conveniently nearHilary 's right hand . It was Evelyn who interrupted : she must have heard the whole thing . She said crisply : " Hilary , you are a fool . Go away . Take that re-P264volver with you . " And when he 'd gone  --  and somehow ' ' . it was not an ignominious departure ; there were threat ' and menace in the solid lines of his shoulders- and his thick red neck  --  she said to me , " Miss Keate , if yote , have any kind and generous womanly instincts youwill forget this  --  this extraordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I could hear her firm footsteps ' crossing the library . Well , somehow I reached my own room . Somehow ; I spent the night , imagining every whisper of sound I heard was Hilary trying to get into my room , with Dave 's revolver , which Adela must have given into keeping , in his unsteady pink hand . It seemed to met ; that Evelyn was asking rather too much of womanly instincts . After a night of restless dreams and wakeful hours I resolved to see the druggist in the morning and get his impression of Adela 's telephone conversation with Bayard . But if it was , as I thought it might well be , a fiction on Adela 's part , then Hilary could not have ; ; + killed Bayard . When morning came , however , I did not immediatelyhave an opportunity to leave the house , and ? , t it soon developed there was to be no need for the-u druggist 's testimony . Shortly after breakfast Adela ' . summoned us into the library again . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that had beenspent for the most part in drugged slumber . But like any keen-sighted general , she knew what her next movewould be ; she knew that in- trying to extricate Dave ' ' , ' she had plated her other brother under suspicion.  |p265We  were all there except Dr. Bouligny ; all of us tired and hollow-eyed and ill at ease . I think we all knew something was coming . Her first words , however , were such as to shock us into strained attention .. For she said , calmly : " The Thatchers appear to have taken to lies . Evelyn did not tell the truth when she said she found Bayard alive . Hilary did not tell the truth when he said he found Bayard alive . And I did not tell the truth . " She faltered a little there but resumed , her blue eyes daring us to doubt , her face gray and stern . " I lied when I said I talked to Bayard over the telephone . I did not . He was dead before I left the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He started forward with a smothered exclamation . Adela silenced him with an imperious motion of her wide white hand . " Wait , Hilary . Let me tell it . I came downstairs and found Bayard dead in the study . I was afraid Dave would be blamed for shooting him . We all knew Dave had made one attempt upon his life . I was frightened . I knew I must hurry and plan something to draw any possible suspicion from Dave . I thought if I telephoned from town and seemed to talk to Bayard from a place where people could hear me , that might make it appearthat Bayard had actually been shot after the time I telephoned , which would be , of course , after the members of the family were out of the house . I even  --  " she faltered briefly here again , smoothing the white ruffle on one wrist and looking at it with unseeingeyes  --  " I even arranged the telephone so                  @ @ @
