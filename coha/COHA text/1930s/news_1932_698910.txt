txt The Bank-Check Tax . To the Editor of The Now York Time* : The banks should not be put to the trouble you mention in connection with the bank-check tax . In Canada , where they have had this tax for some years , every customer is supposed to put the stamp on his check at time of issue . But every firm , and almost every individual , has their checks embossed with the stamp , and the banks keep on hand a large supply of checks with the embossed stamp , which are sold to customers who pay the 2 cents for each check , in book form or otherwise . This eliminates the bookkeeping you mention , and possibly if the tax is with us for a long time , the idea of the embossed stamp on the checks may be taken up here . The Canadian Government prints the checks , and the income helps the Government Printing Department , E. M. HOBEN . Pearl River , N. Y. , June 28 , 1932.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
