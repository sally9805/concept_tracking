400 MILLION CUSTOMERS-Carl Crow-Harper ( $3 ) . <P> To judge by the writings of travelers , philosophers , novelists and the like , most foreigners in China are on the trail of something almost as visionary as the philosopher 's stone . But in fact what entices most foreigners to China is the vision of doing business with China 's 400,000,000 potential customers . For the past 25 years head of a Shanghai advertising agency , Carl Crow now reveals in 400 Million Customers where he got to while following that vision . An unpretentious , anecdotal account , it is pleasant reading because it deals with a novel part of the Chinese scene and because its humor is as often at the expense of the author and his clients as of the Chinese . <P> In general , Author Crow 's problem was one of learning ( by U. S. advertising standards ) to do business standing on his head-a position which produced a remarkable number of headaches . In explanation he cites the Chinese consumer 's upsidedown wish to buy rather than be sold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one he has got , resulting in an all-round sales resistance calculated to turn an occidental adman 's hair grey . Example : Smarting under the British monopoly , a U. S. client gave the Crow agency a go-ahead on the biggest advertising campaign ever put on in China . Chinese smokers took a few sample puffs , grimaced , went back to the British brand . When another manufacturer duplicated a favorite British blend exactly , designed a beautiful packet , priced it lower , the sales were still nil . Chinese customers , guided by the Confucian maxim that " fine words and an insinuating appearance are seldom associated with true virtue , " merely figured the more elegant the packet , the cheaper the price , the shoddier the quality . Drugs , another leading gold mine for western civilization 's advertisers , were an even bigger flop than cigarets . " The total consumption of foreign pills , " says Crow , " probably does not average much more than one pill per annum per person . " Yet curiously enough reliable insurance companies call the Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more gratifying because so rare were the two campaigns which the Crow agency did put across . As publisher of China 's first fashion book , introducing slit skirts to replace trousers , Author Crow is proud to have brought out of hiding " the most beautiful leg the world has ever seen . " As publisher of China 's first manual on poker-playing , he not only turned out a tremendous bestseller , but had the deep satisfaction of restoring that game to the classic traditions obtaining when he played it in Fort Worth , Tex . 30 years ago , before decadence set in through the use of wild cards . <P> Having filled a good-sized book with observations on personnel problems , Chinese face-saving , food , business etiquet , chiseling , the role of witch-doctors in business , the vagaries of U. S. export managers , and whatever else was at hand except a statement of profits , Author Crow gently implies that although the Chinese birth rate is approximately one a minute , it consists of a remarkably small number of suckers.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
