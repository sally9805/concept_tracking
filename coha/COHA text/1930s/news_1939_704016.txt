txt An expedition of marine explorers revealed plans here today for walking under 300 feet of water , encased in recently developed helium gas diving suits , along the ancient streets of a once-flourishing island city in the Lesser Antilles . Capt . Robert Hall of Detroit said the expedition hoped to accumulate data concerning St. James , former capital of St. Kitts ' Island . The town has been submerged for more than 214 centuries ? since an earthquake dropped it into the sea in 1680 . Captain Hall told of the plans for his expedition after he had offered use of the helium diving suits to the Navy at Portsmouth , N. H. , for work at the sunken submarine Squalus . Max Gene Nohl , diver , has been down 420 feet in the new type of deep sea contraption , Captain Hall said . No air tube is attached ? only a cable , the center of which is a small telephme wire for communication The equipment contains a supply of helium and oxygen and needs no life line to compressed air machines on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navigators , deep sea photographers , artists , writers , divers and explorers will leave here probably Saturday in the motor-ship Albee . Describing the mysterious lure of the submerged city , he explained : " When the sea is calm you can see in the crystal-clear water 300 feet below the dim outline of the coral-encrusted walls of the ancient town that was a thriving community long before the revolutionary war , long before there was any United States .
