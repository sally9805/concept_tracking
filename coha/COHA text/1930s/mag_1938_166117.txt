Man is made up of truth and belief ; and , if he is deceived into the belief that he has , or is liable to have , a disease , the belief is catching and the result follows it . <P> This contagious dogma was uncorked 70 years ago by an unlettered New England clockmaker , Phineas Parkhurst Quimby of Belfast , Me . He had discovered that he could mesmerize people , and in collaboration with a clairvoyant youth named Lucius Burkmar he cured all manner of ills . To him in 1862 went a formidable , twice-married invalid , Mary Morse Baker Glover Patterson , who after her third marriage was to become known as Mary Baker Eddy , founder of the Christian Science church . <P> Cured by Quimby , Mrs. Patterson absorbed his ideas , wrote of them in letters and public prints , composed a poem upon his death in 1866 .
