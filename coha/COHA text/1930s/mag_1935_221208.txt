( See front cover ) Astronomy deals with Earth , and with everything discernible beyond Earth . Its task is detecting , locating , describing and classifying countless millions of diverse objects-meteors , planets , comets , stars , shining streams of gas . dark clouds of cosmic debris , galaxies and super-galaxies glimmering across unimaginable gulfs of space . To avoid duplication of effort , to facilitate exchange of information and encourage cooperative research , astronomy 's huge and complex task was years ago brought under the scrutiny and partial control of an international body . The International Astronomical Union , undisturbed by terrestrial wars and politics , held its first congress in 1922 at Rome . Since then it has met in England . The Netherlands , the U. S. , once every three or four years . Last week it wound up its fifth congress in Paris , with 300 astronomers from 25 nations in attendance . Meeting . The Congress : Planned an international map of the nearby sky , an enormous mosaic to consist of 11,000 photographs of which 8,000 are already available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24-hour time , already in fairly wide use in Europe . Dropped in 24-hour time are " a. m. " and " p. m. , " 1 p. m. becoming 13 o'clock ; 10:30 p. m. , 22:30 . Received from the Commission on Planets , Comets &; Satellites a unanimous opinion that the atmosphere of Mars is less than 1% as rich in oxygen as Earth 's air-insufficient to sustain " life as we know it . " Contemplated progress made on the naming of 2,000 minor planets circulating mostly between Mars and Jupiter and of which the largest is Ceres ( diameter 480 mi . ) . Heard the Commission on Meteorites strongly urge the Soviet Government to make further study of the Siberian fall of 1908 , heaviest fall of meteorites in history , which scorched trees for miles around , annihilated 1,500 reindeer , dammed the Ognia River . The French Government was also urged to push thorough examination of the Chinguetti , an iron meteorite 325 ft. long and weighing possibly a million tons , which a French expedition stumbled on in 1921 in the wilds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congress was a U. S. astronomer , square , heavy-jowled Director Frank Schlesinger of Yale Observatory , whose fame is associated with parallax . Earth 's annual orbit around the Sun is 186,000,000 miles across ; therefore the direction of stars as observed from Earth on opposite sides of that orbit changes slightly . This change is called parallax . Even the nearer stars are so far off that their parallax is extremely small , and for remote stars it is not discernible at all . Nevertheless since the amount of apparent displacement depends on how far away the star is , parallax furnished the first dependable clue to stellar distances . Beginning in 1903 , Frank Schlesinger developed such effective photographic methods of parallax measurement that now some 2,000 have been accurately determined . Elected president of the next Congress , to be held in 1938 at Stockholm , was Ernest Esclangon , 59 , director of the observatories at Paris and Meudon and Professor of Astronomy at University of Paris .                   @ @
