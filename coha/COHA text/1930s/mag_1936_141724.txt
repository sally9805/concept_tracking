Labor 's good friend , Franklin Roosevelt , has a good Arkansas friend , Utilities Tycoon Harvey Couch , who owns an 863-mi. backwoods railroad line , the Louisiana &; Arkansas . Last September some 400 of its engineers , firemen , brakemen and conductors walked out on strike . Demanding restoration of a wage agreement abrogated in 1933 , they wanted the company to bargain jointly with their five union brotherhoods . President Peter Couch , the owner 's brother , once an L. &; A. fireman himself , insisted on dealing with them separately . He hired strikebreakers to keep in operation the railroad 's service between Dallas , Tex. , Hope , Ark. and New Orleans . <P> Picketing was peaceful for three weeks . Then trouble popped . A train ran through an open switch , killing two of the crew . Three bridges burned . The strikers ' womenfolk got hungry . At Minden , La. 200 of them swarmed on a train , stripped and beat the fireman , made the engineer telegraph his resignation to President Peter Couch . <P> Near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , five cars derailed . Outside Alexandria a shower of bullets spattered the Shreveport-New Orleans Hustler , smashed a Pullman window , narrowly missed a passenger . At Winnfield birthplace of Huey Long , a howling pistolwaving , rock-throwing mob besieged a tramload of Louisiana State University football rooters returning to Baton Rouge after a game with the University of Arkansas at Shreveport . Train guards ordered all lights out . The passengers were forced to lie on the aisle floors for hours , keep up their courage by sucking at flasks until local police drove off the mob . <P> As the Hustler rolled down the tracks near Winnfield one midnight last week shotguns flashed in a bordering wood , ten loads of buckshot poured into the tram , killed a guard , wounded the engineer and fireman . Unintimidated President Couch set guards and inspectors patrolling the line from Shreveport to New Orleans , posted $5,000 reward for the murderers . While rumors crackled the Federal Government might take a hand because of interference with the mails , the National Mediation Board proclaimed its hands tied because of President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor Leche called a peace conference for this week .
