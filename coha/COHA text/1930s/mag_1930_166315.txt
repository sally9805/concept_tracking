Modern missionaries lead safe lives ; the years are long past when cannibals ate them . But at the Africa Inland Mission Station in Kijabe is a little dwelling some 300 yards from the rest of the buildings . Hulda Stumpf , Secretary to the Head Missionary , lived there alone . She was 63 , had been in Kijabe for 20 years . She had grown deaf in the Lord 's service . Last week her body was found , attacked , bruised , smothered to death .
