Sells <P> In Columbus , Ohio , Mrs. Christian Sells Jaeger , historian of the Columbus Genealogical Society , trailing the Sells family back through the ages in genealogical libraries in Chicago , Washington and New York , solemnly announced that she had tracked it down to Adam . Her course ( going backward ) : Rhode Island 's Roger Williams , Britain 's Plantagenets , 21 generations of Scottish kings , 19 centuries of Irish kings , Egypt 's Pharaoh Nectonidus ; Judah 's Zedekiah , Israel 's David , Enos , Seth and thus ( 4,000 B.C. ) Adam . <P> Baby <P> In Manhattan , an unidentified 18-month-old boy in a pink zipper suit turned up in a Woolworth 5- &-10; store , talking his own private language , grabbing merchandise indiscriminately . Because the customers were amused , the management let him alone until he started painting the floor with shoe polish . At the police station , he pulled plugs out of the signal switchboard , nearly wrecked the teletype machine , dined on cheese , jelly sandwiches and milk , went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , found a sleeping Negro there , kicked him in the face , refused a bath . At the New York Foundling Hospital , nurses agreed he was the dirtiest child they had ever seen , bathed him . <P> Exhibition <P> In Canton , China , the local fire department scheduled an exhibition leap from a burning three-story platform . With 10,000 spectators watching , two Chinese firemen climbed to the top . Someone set fire to the gasoline-soaked frame before the life net was ready . When the flames reached the top , the two firemen jumped to their death . <P> Puzzlers <P> At their semi-annual convention in Manhattan , members of the National Puzzlers ' League teased one another 's brains for three days with : an anagram for " a counterfeit nickel " ( solution : " Notice , fake lucre , tin " ) ; a transdeletion or progressive anagram from ' " sod " to " countryside " in eleven changes ; a rebus of an H written inside a G , both over a W ( since it is The H and writ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " The handwriting on the wall " ) ; and interminable alphagrams , charades , transposals , cryptograms , rhomboids , antigrams , palindromes , inverted pyramids and plain puzzles . Outstanding contribution was a " seventeen pyramid " ( crossword puzzle whose bottom line has 17 letters , top one ) . Most useful contribution was a new longest word in the English language , 45-letter " **45;7647;TOOLONG , " to replace 28-letter " **28;7694;TOOLONG . " The new one means a kind of silicosis caused by particles of siliceous volcanic dust .
