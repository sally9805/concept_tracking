txt At the closing session Of the sixth annual seminar of the Committee on Cultural Relations With Latin America here yesterday , Miss Florence E. Allen , justice of the Supreme Court of Ohio , urged that all nations concede the existence in other nations of pressing national problems and recognize the right of each to settle its problems in its own fashion . The actual barrier to an understanding , she said , is the wall of prejudice built up between races down through history , and now , in . these days of rationalization , the inventing of fine phrases and philosophical theories to justify this prejudice , is nothing more than an unwillingness to discover and acknowledge the virtue of other lands . History , she continued , presents a conflict of social development , and the inevitable outcome has been the rise and fall of this or that civilization with all the accompanying hatred , suspicions , interventions and was marking the growth and decline of national groups . Yet each civilization has added its own contribution to the history of the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then offer assistance only when assistance is %ought . Other Considerations There are other contributions worth considering in life besides mass production , Judge Allen Said ; the training of boys and girls In home , church and school is an enormous element in proper human development and , if it controls fear , hatred and avarice , and furnishes an ability to tap the well of resources in men , there will have been found that means through which nations of the earth shall concede the right for each to reach its own level . Concerning Mexico , Miss Allen said its people had been robbed of ejidos ( tracts of land to be cultivated ) and subjected to peonage to an extent perhaps unequaled in the civilized world . The endurance of those people , she said , sets an example not excelled by the people of the United States who fought a revolution for freedom , and it can not be wondered at that these Mexicans sought likewise to throw off the yoke through revolution . With that fact in view , has any nation the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravely troublefl , have improperly solved their difficulties . With regard to the doctrine of democracy , she pointed out that it can not be limited to any one group of people ; no group has the right to say how the United States , England , France , Germany and Mexico shall govern themselves if the right to self-government has any meaning  --  and the slow advance from the Magna Charta down through the Declaration of Independence to the present day signified that it does  --  then the same right belongs to all nations . Doctrine Long Fostered Such , she said , was the doctrine fostered by Washington , Jefferson , Madison , Lincoln , Cleveland , Wilson , and now by President Hoover , and it means that international interpretation of democracy recognized the equality of all groups , regardless of wealth and power . But this international underStanding can not come merely through the reading of history , she protested , or from the world traveler , or social students , with unusual opportunities for contact , although such methods will help . She said a far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required is that nations admit the contributions that other nations are making to the civilized world . " In our own country , the United States , we do not always obtain complete justice in solving pressing Problems ; the results are only approximate . Why then , should we attempt to solve the problems of the world ? " she asked . For example , property owners are sometimes drastically affected by zoning regulations in American cities , yet these laws constitute an honest effort to solve one of the city 's difficulties . This example Is only one of many , but it serves as a comparison to similar efforts-being made by Mexico further to Justify her right of non-interference . " It is my personal opinion that , by realizing such rights , the United States will make one of its chief contributions to the world ; such a realization will be an understanding that the people of Mexico , and of those countries farther south , coming through sufferings such as history has seldom seen , are entitled to forbearance and sympathy. their efforts to solve ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
