Had the U. S. been informed two months ago that Chicago was suffering an outbreak of amebic dysentery , a good many people might have stayed away from the city , with consequent loss to its Fair , hotels and restaurants . Not until last week , when the city 's Congress and Auditorium hotels broke the story by canceling scheduled banquets , did the situation become public . By that time the Fair was ready to close ( see p. 53 ) , the epidemic under control . <P> Also by that time more than 100,000 summer visitors who had been exposed to the disease were scattered throughout the land . Thirty-four of them , in 26 cities , as well as 79 persons still in Chicago , were known to have contracted the disease . Sixteen victims were dead . The U. S. Public Health Service warned all U. S. health officers to be on watch for outbreaks of the disease in their communities . <P> Amebic dysentery is a disease of uncleanliness . Occurring primarily in the tropics , it is common in the U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North during the past decade . It is caused by amebae-one-celled parasites-in the intestinal canal . The parasites enter the canal through the mouth , in food or drink . Some of them leave in intestinal discharges . In the U. S. , with its well-guarded water and sewage systems , the parasites are spread chiefly by infected food handlers who fail to wash their hands thoroughly . As with typhoid bacilli , the parasites may be carried by humans who do not suffer from the disease . <P> Chicago ordinarily has one or two cases of amebic dysentery a month . Last August the number jumped to 15 . The first two cases were traced to the big , popular Congress Hotel on South Michigan Boulevard . Examination of 364 of its food handlers revealed 15 active cases , 11 carriers . One of them was the Assyrian cook thought to have been the source of Chicago 's last outbreak of the disease , in 1927 . Infected employes were also discovered at the nearby Auditorium Hotel , and two restaurants . <P> Amebic dysentery 's symptoms-severe abdominal pain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear until 18 to 90 days after infection . To Alfred Emanuel Smith , James Aloysius Farley and some 18,000 other persons who had stayed at one of the infested hotels during the summer , Chicago 's Board of Health dispatched guarded inquiries about their health . Those who reported illness were urged to consult physicians . Most cases of amebic dysentery can be cured if treated early . But U. S. physicians , unacquainted with it , often diagnose it as ulcerated colitis , peritonitis , appendicitis . Mary Louise ( " Texas " ) Guinan , famed nightclub hostess , died in Vancouver , B. C. last fortnight after an operation for ulcerated colitis ( TIME , Nov. 13 ) . Last week it was discovered that she had really had amebic dysentery , probably contracted during a visit to Chicago last summer .
