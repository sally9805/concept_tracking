" What do you mean , which one ' ? " I said . " You go ahead and pick yourself two or three . " " What 's the matter with you , Heshie ? " she said , laughing . " Are you crazy to-day ? " " I 'm not crazy , " I said , " and you 're not taking only one dress . You 're taking at least two . Understand ? " She stood there , hesitating . " What 's the matter , Ma ? " I asked . " I ca n't make up my mind , " she said . " I like these . " She pointed to the three simple , quiet ones . " But  --  " " But what ? " " But since you gave me that long speech about the beauty parlor , " she said , " I 'm just thinking , maybe I ought to get these  --  " she pointed to the flashy ones  --  " maybe they 'll make me look a little  --  a little younger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hug , right in the middle of the store . All of a sudden I felt a new way about my mother . All of a sudden I felt proud of her . " Gee whiz , Ma , " I said , " you 're a corker , all right . Go ahead and take the ones you like , " I said , " and do n't take all that beauty parlor talk too seriously . I was only kidding anyway . " " All right , then , " she said to the salesgirl . " I 'll take this one . " She pointed to one of the nice-looking dresses . " What 's that ? " I said sharply . " I said I 'll take this one , " she said . " That 's what I thought I heard , " I said . " What did I say about this one dress business , hah ? " " Oh , Heshie , " she said , " Do n't act like a baby .

" " All three , sir ? " " All three . " " But Heshie  --  ! " " But Mama ! " I said , imitating her voice . I felt so good about her having had the taste to pick something dignified , and not something that would make her look like a loud Bronx blouse , that I was willing to buy out the shop for her . " How are you going to make Mrs. Heimowitz eat her heart out if you have n't got enough dresses to wear a new one every day ? " " All right , Heshie , " she agreed , shaking her finger at me . " But remember , that 's all . " " That 's all nothing , " I said . " The Bronx is full of shoe stores and hat shops and underwear shops , is n't it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you should waste your money like that , Heshie , " she said . " Who says it 's wasting it ? " I said , hugging her . " I do n't know why , but to me it 's a pleasure , Ma. "  | TAKE me , for instance . I can read the handwriting on the wall long before it 's even written . The trick is simply to recognize that it 's writing . Sometimesit does n't look like it . Sometimes it looks like Miss Marmelstein . " And what did you say your last name was ? " I said , lettingmy eyes take their time as they crossed the Alps . " Marmelstein , " she said . " All right , Miss Marmelstein , " I said , " then you know what 's wanted of you . " Or did she ? " You can take your things off and get to work . " " Thank you , Mr. Bogen . " I nodded briskly and turned back to the papers on my desk . Baby , I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm thanking you . I got up and walked to the filing cabinet at one side of the room . I opened the top drawer and began to thumb through the papers in it . I did n't have to . I was n't looking for anything . But standing in that position , leaning over the pulled-out drawer , I could get a clear view of her in profile , as she sat at the switchboard , with her chest stickingout in a way that did my heart good . She knew I was looking at her because I could see her face grow red and she put her hand up to the back of her neck to adjust the wave in her hair . Once or twice she almost turned around to face me , but she caught herself in time and kept her eyes fixed on the switchboard.  |p103I  laughed to myself when I thought of what her face would look like if I went up to her and told her what I was thinking . The temptation was so great that I almost walked over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you ? That 's good . Oh , all right , thank you . Ca n't kick . Do n't strain yourself , Miss Marmelstein . You do n't have to lean forward that far . In fact , Miss Marmelstein , you could have taken a day off to-day . I mean , for a change , you could have worn a brassiereto-day . What ? Oh , pardon me . I did n't think I was being subtle . No , of course not . I do n't mind . What I mean is , Miss Marmelstein , it 's no go to-day . There , there , now . Do n't take it that hard . You do ? Well , I do n't really blame you . From what I understand , that 's the best way to take it . No , please , please , it 's not that . No reflection on your ability at all , Miss Marmelstein . Look , Miss Marmelstein , suppose you stop working so hard waving that chest of yours under my nose . Fine . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ha  --  I 'm not displeased , though . It 's a good thing to find out . But not to-day . Some other time , maybe . To-day , Miss Marmelstein , to-day you 're a piece of handwriting on the wall , that 's what you are . Ha , ha , ha . You do n't ? Why , that 's easy . Let me translate . You , of all people , should know how a good thing gets around . Does n't it , though ? The competition gets terrific , does n't it , Miss Marmelstein ? Before you know it , there are too many people around . And then , of course , there 's only one smart thing to do . And that 's to go and find something else . Yes , indeed , Miss Marmelstein , we 're both in the same boat . A thing that 's as good as my business ca n't help getting a reputation . And all you need , Miss Marmelstein , is a reputation . You know that . My bet is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delivery business . But I wo n't be one of them , Miss Marmelstein . Because I 've seen the handwriting on the wall . And I 'm getting out , Miss Marmelstein , while I 'm still the only one that can see it . Do I make myself clear ? That 's it . That 's it exactly . I 'm going to cash in while I 'm ahead . 1 do make myself clear ? Good . You do ? Well , that 's too bad . Because frankly , Miss Marmelstein , if I was as talented in one directionas you are , I would n't want to learn anything else . Oh , now , please . It 's not that at all . I would teach you , if I could , Miss Marmelstein . But I 'm afraid it wo n't do . When it comes to a talent like that , Miss Marmelstein , it 's a lot like your figure . Votes do n't count . You 're either born that way , or you are n't . So it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dime cigars . Miss Marmelstein ! Please ! I told you I was n't  --  Oh , well , all right . Let 's . I walked back to my desk and moved around the papers on top of it for a few minutes . Then I took my hat and went over to the switchboard . " I 'm going out , Miss Marmelstein , " I said , staring hard at her . They looked like the money , all right , but the way they built brassieres nowadays , you never could tell . Still , this looked like it was worth the trouble of finding out . " I 'll be back a little late . You can put my messages in the book and I 'll  --  but wait . I 'll tell you what . I 'll try to get back before six . You wait for me , will you ? I 'm going out to see some people , and I may want to dictate a couple of letters when I get back . I 'll try to get back as early as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try , did n't I ? " All right , Mr. Bogen , " she said . As I walked down the street I kept meeting my clients . I nodded and said hello and moved on . By the time I reached the bank I was good and sore . My business was good . But compared with some of the heels whose bundles my men schlepped at two bits a piece , my take was chicken feed . I had more on the ball than they had , and there was no reason why I could n't deal myself a couple of hands fromp105the same deck . Why should I be jockeying their bundles ? Why should n't I be in a position where I was hiring guys to make deliveries for me ? I did n't bother trying to figure out the answer to this one . As far as I was concerned there was n't any . I was glad I 'd run into those clients . Now I knew what my next move was going to be . " Give it to me in fives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mama 's payday . I got a kick out of givingit to her in small bills , so that it felt like a lot . It was a pleasure to hand it to her . In fact , if I did n't keep close watch on myself , I would 've found myself not only giving it to her in a big wad , but also made up of big bills . That 's the kind of soft-hearted dope I am . But there was no hurry . When my next move went through , she 'd get her cut . I 'd see to that . For me , the world owed her a little extra . When I got out , I stood in the street , hesitating . Threethirtyin the afternoon , and nothing to do . That was progressfor you . But I was n't satisfied . There were guys who had nothing to do after as early as twelve o'clock . And there were some who did n't have to go to work at all , were n't there ? Well , at least I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Capitol . When I got out , the clock on the Paramount said sixthirty . But I did n't hurry . I knew my customers . She 'd be there . I came into the office briskly , though , like I 'd just settled a deal for moving Pennsylvania Station over to Forty-Second Street and shifting Grand Central over to Thirty-Third . She was at the switchboard , typing away busily . " Sorry to be so late , " I said , " but I was detained at a conference . " " That 's all right , Mr. Bogen , " she said . It was , eh ? Well , we 'd soon see.  |p106I  breezed into my private office , slammed the drawers of my desk around a little , then came out again , holding a blank sheet of paper . " What 's that you 're working on ? " I asked . " The bills , " she said . " Mr. Maltz said it 's the first of the month  --  " " Good for Mr. Maltz , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do n't bother , " I said . " Mr. Maltz was just telling you it was the first of the month and  --  " " And he said I should type up the bills , " she continued . " He said they had to be in the mail to-night . " " That 's right , " I said . " By the way , where is Mr. Maltz ? " " Why , he 's not here , he  --  " " You mean that ? " She looked startled , then she saw my smile and she smiled too . " I mean , he left a short while ago . He said he had an ap-pointment . " " Oh , " I said . " For a while , from what you said , I thought he was hiding under a desk or something . " That one was pretty lousy , but what the hell , when you 're paying them a salary , they laugh at the lousy ones , too . She laughed . " No , Mr. Bogen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " We-ell , I 'll tell you , " I said , scratching my head and looking at the piece of blank paper in my hand , " I wanted to give you a couple of letters on this , but  --  " I looked at the typewriter . "  --  But Mr. Maltz was right . Those bills have to be in the mail to-night . Otherwise we do n't get our checks in on time . I 'll tell you what , " I said suddenly , like Morgan deciding to float a small loan for England . " Those bills are a good hour 's job . It 's almost seven now . Suppose we bothp107go down for a bite , then , when we come back , I can give you these letters , and after you 've finished typing up the bills , and while you 're typing these letters for me , I 'll give you a hand with folding the bills and putting them in envelopes . Like that we 'll both get out earlier . What do you say ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , well . This was going to be interesting . " Wait 'll I get my hat , " I said . There goes another rule , I said to myself as I adjusted the brim in the mirror . And a good one , too . Never crap where you eat . But I do n't worry much about breaking rules . As long as I know them , that 's enough for me . And besides , this was different . I was paying her a salary anyway , was n't I ? And the office rent was the same whether I used it eight hours a day or twenty-four , was n't it ? And besides , that rule was only for rummies , to see that they do n't get themselves tied up . Which was something I did n't have to worry about . I do n't get myself tied up.  | A WEEK later I was watching Tootsie through the crack in my door . I waited until he put on his topcoat and hat and began to pull on his gloves . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short and looked quickly toward my room , but I knew he could n't see me . The opening was n't wide enough . " Can I see you for a minute , Tootsie ? " I spoke in a loud voice so he could hear me through the partitions . " Sure , " he said , coming back . " Be right in , " he said and began to wrestle out of the coat . " You can come in the way you are , " I said . " I wo n't keep you long . " He stopped fooling with the topcoat and looked like a kid that 's been caught in the icebox . Then he tried to get back as far into the coat as he 'd been when I called him , at the same time walking toward my room . The result was that when he came in , he looked like something the cat forgot to drop at the door . It 's a funny thing about clothes . If you 've got the build , and you know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a nineteen-seventy-five . But if you have n't got that natural feel for clothes , it does n't make any difference how much you spend on them . There was Tootsie , standing before me in one of the snappiest numbers that Kolmer-Marcus ever put out . I 'd helped him pick it myself and I 'd seen him lay seventy-five dollars inp109American money on the counter for it . But for all the good it was doing his appearance , he could have left it hanging in his closet . " I 'll tell you what I wanted you for , " I said , and stopped as though I had just noticed something . " Say , your coat there , it 's on all cockeyed . The collar 's bent in . " " Yeah  --  I  --  I was , " he began , flushing and stuttering all over the lot as he tried to straighten the coat out over his form . He could have saved himself the trouble . Nothing would ever fit him right . He was built like a dumbbell . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turning back to the papers on my desk , " if you 're in a hurry , then suppose we let it go till to-night . " " I 'm not in any hurry , " he said . " If you want  --  " I turned around to look at him . " You 're not in any hurry ? " I said . " Well , I mean  --  I  --  I mean , if there 's anything you want , I  --  " " That 's all right , " I said . " It 'll keep . I 'll see you about it some other time . There 's no rush . To-night is time enough . " " Okay , " he said , and turned to go . " That is , " I added , " if you can tear yourself away by to-night . " He whirled around . " What do you  --  ? " " Skip it , Tootsie , " I said , smiling at him . " Skip it . " After all , I 'd done him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first night , when I had to show him who was boss . Now , though , there was no need for another demonstration . I might just as well give him a break . God knows , there were n't many times when a guy could afford to be generous . Why be a louse , when I did n't have to be ? A guy has to give tip his principles sometimes.  | " Let 's make it for to-night , " I said . " Okay ? I want to talk to you about something . " " Well , I wo n't be back to-night , " he said . I raised my eyebrows . Maybe another demonstration was in order . " I beg your pardon ? " I said elaborately , putting my palm behind my ear . " Did I understand you to say you 're not coming back to-night ? " He dropped his eyes from mine . " I mean , Harry , " he said , " I mean I made arrangements to go up to the mountains for the week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh ! " I said , dropping back in my chair and waving my hand at him . " That 's different . I did n't know that . I just thought I heard wrong , that 's all . You go right ahead , Tootsie . Monday is all right . " " I 'm here now , ai n't I ? If you wan na  --  " " Shall we make it Monday morning ? " I said with a grin . " Say , about nine-thirty or ten ? That ought to give you time enough . " " Listen , Harry . You ca n't  --  " " Nine-thirty Monday morning , Tootsie ? " He opened his mouth and then closed it . " Okay , " he said , " I 'll be back Monday , " and went out . I was n't positive yet , of course . But I was certain that before long I would know what I needed Tootsie for . I had a hunch I 'd know why I had n't tossed him out on his tail as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the receiver and spoke to Miss Marmelstein . " Get my home , " I said . A few moments later Mother was on the wire . " Hello , Ma . " " Hello , Heshie , " she said . " What 's the matter ? " 1 " What do you mean , what 's the matter ? " I said . " Does something have to be the matter before a fellow can call up his mother ? " " God forbid , " she said . " But just the same , what 's the matter ? " " Nothing 's the matter , " I said . " I just wanted to try out the new telephone . How does it feel to have a telephone in the house ? How do you feel ? " " How should I feel ? " she said . " The same as I felt when you left in the morning . All right . And how do you feel ? " " I feel all right , Ma , " I said . " So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " So it 's perfect . Now , Heshie , what 's the matter ? " I laughed . " You 're okay , Ma , " I said . " Try and put one over on you , hah ? " She laughed too . " Well , you can try , Heshie , " she said . " All right , then , Ma , " I said , " I 'll tell you why I called . I wanted to know how the blintzes situation was . " " Oh , my God ! " she said . " How could a person eat so much ? Three times you had them last week . And now , now you want them again ! " " Can I help it , Ma , if you make them so good ? " " Never mind with the fancy talk , " she said .

So it 'll be without I , ! intzes to-night , Heshie . Kill you , it wo n't . It 's not good you should eat so much the same thing . I 'll make you a nice piece spring chicken for to-night . You 'll have blintzes again in a couple days , maybe next week . " " Aah , Ma , do n't be like that , " I said . " I wanted to bring a friend home for supper to-night . Here I been talking about your blintzes to everybody , and now , now I 'm bringingsomebody home to try them , so you 're not going to make them ! I ask you , Ma , is that nice ? " " Oh , you 're bringing somebody home , hah ? " Her voice dropped a bit . " Who is it ? " " Just a friend , Ma . " " A boy , or a girl ? " " Ma , will you stop trying to marry me off , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend of mine . A business friend . And I want him to  --  " " All right , Heshalle , " she said cheerfully .

" Okay , then , Ma , thanks . I 'll see you to-night . " " All right , Heshie . Good-bye . " I took my hat and coat and stopped at the switchboard on my way out . " I 'm going over to Pulvermacher , Betschmann &; Kalisch , " I said . " If a Mr. Babushkin calls me from there , tell him I 'm on my way over . If anybody else calls , just take the message .

But I kept on moving toward the door . I do n't let those things worry me . Just because I slipped her the business once , that does n't change our relationship . She was still an employee of mine , and I was still paying her a salary . When I got up to Pulvermacher , Betschmann &; Kalisch , Inc . I went into the shipping room and spoke to the man in charge of it.  | " Hello , Singer , " I said . " Everything all right ? " " Yes , Mr. Bogen , " he said . " Everything 's fine . " " Packages moving out on time ? " " Oh , yes . Everything 's okay . " " That 's fine , " I said , making a notation in my pocket notebook for his benefit .

I noticed here  --  " I looked at my notebook  --  " you had almost twenty for Chicago and Los Angeles last week . You might as well take advantage of the extra couple of hours , and it 's no extra bother for us , you know . " " Oh , I do n't think that 's necessary , Mr. Bogen , " he said . Neither did I.

" I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word ' Service ' stands for in our name . " " Thanks , " he said . " I 'll call you if we need it . " I turned to go , and stopped . " Oh , by the way , is Mr. Babushkin around ? " " Why , yes . I think so . He should be in the cutting room , I guess . Did you want to see him about business ? " " Why , yes , " I said , " if he 's not busy . I just wanted to ask him some questions about a new scheme I 'm working out for delivering cut work to contractors .

Straight through this door and turn to your right . " " Thanks , " I said , and went through the door . Babushkin looked up at me from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wax chalk he wasworking with . " Hello , there , Meyer , " I said heartily . " Hello , Bogen , " he said , looking to right and left at the people working around him . I guess that was another thing I 'd have to teach him-. manners . I call him Meyer , and he calls me Bogen ! He came around the cutting table quickly to head me off . " You want me , Bogen ? " he said nervously . " Yeah , " I said , " I just wanted to ask you if  --  " " Ssshhh , " he said under his breath , " not so loud . Do n't talk about that here , Bogen . I do n't want  --  " " About what ? " I said , playing dumb . " About the  --  you know  --  about  --  " " Oh ! " I said , putting my hand on his shoulder .

" I got a surprise for you , " she said with a smile , and began to lead me by the hand toward the living room . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My friend get here early ? " It was only a few minutes after six , and Babushkin did n't look like the kind that could talk his wife out of or into things very easily . " No , " Mother said , " it 's not your friend . " We reached the doorway of the living room and she stood aside , beaming , so I could look into the room . A dark-haired girl in a black and white dress was sitting iii the new armchair , looking up from the pages of the magazine she had been turning on her lap , and smiling . She did n't have to turn sideways to show the long , drooping nose for me to realize that it was just the kind of Jewishlookingsquash I 'd been spending three-quarters of my wakinghours since I was thirteen trying to avoid . " This is Ruthie Rivkin , " Mother said , smiling toward her . " Mrs. Rivkin 's daughter . You remember Mrs. Rivkin , Heshie , she had the grocery store when we used to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . But I did n't smile . I could see right away that the only way out of this situation was to make as few encouraging remarks as possible . " How do you do ? " I said . What the hell , you ca n't be impolite to your mother 's guests . " Hello , " she said , and smiled . Her voice was pleasant and her teeth were square and white . And the smile accented the softness that was in her face in spite of the profile . And she could thank heaven for one thing : while she was definitely on the plump side , she was just as definitely not fat . But it would only have been fair to tip her off in advance that it was going to take a lot more than a couple of redeeming features if she even wanted to place in the competition for my lily white hand in marriagethat her mother was obviously entering her in .

" Seems to me you should invite your guests because you like them , not because they can eat a lot of blintzes . " " First of all , " Mother said , " where did you get so high class , so fancy , with this Miss Rivkin talk ? Her name is Ruthie .

" I said , lifting them for her to see.  | " Of course , " she said , still smiling , and mother and I walked toward the kitchen together . " Nice work , Ma , " I said sarcastically in a low voice . " Why do n't you open up a marriage broker 's office ? Or maybe you could just stick a sign in the window ? I 'll bet you could pick up a nice piece of change that way . " She stopped to look at me with an injured expression . " Why , Heshiel Is that a nice way to talk ? Ca n't I even invite an old neighbor 's daughter to have a bite to eat with us without you should begin right away  --  ? " " Yeah , I know , Ma , I know , " I said , patting her shoulder . " You just wanted to have somebody to try out the new armchair , did n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're only afraid somebody is going to grab you and marry you , are n't you , Heshie ? " " I 'm not afraid , " I said . " The only thing is , of all the days in the year for you to pull your fancy stuff and try to get me a wife  --  yeah , I know , I know , you were n't even thinking of t hat  --  but of all the days in the year for you to do your stuff , Ma , you have to go ahead and pick out the one night when I 've got an important business friend coming up to see me . Why do n't you let me know in advance when you 're going to do these things , Ma ? " She smiled wisely . " I should tell you in advance , so you should n't come home for supper that night ? " she said . I pounced on her quickly . " Oh , so now you 're admitting it , eh ? " I said . " Who , me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I admitting ? Vliat did I say ? I did n't say nothing . I just  --  " " Yeah , " I said , " I know . Well , let 's not waste time argu-i ng about it . I do n't mind , Ma , except this one night you had to  --  "  | " Aah , Heshie , do n't be a baby . What did I spoil for you . what ? You want to talk business , so talk business . A girl by the table is going to spoil everything ? " " You bet she 's not , " I said . " Because as soon as we finish eating , I 'm taking my friend into the living room where we can talk and you can do what you want with your Ruthie . " " All right , all right , " she said , pushing me back toward the living room . " In the meantime , show at least the little bit good manners I taught you . Do n't leave a girl she should sit alone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie and went back into the living room . She smiled as I came in . I hated to admit it , but when she smiled in that soft appealing way , she had something . Why does a gift like that have to be given to a girl from the Bronx ? " I 'm afraid I 'll have to call you by your first name , " I said , walking over to the sofa across the room from her . " My mother is a pretty determined woman , and she 's put her foot down about it . " I stopped for a moment , surprised . I wanted to say it again , just to make sure I 'd heard myself right . " I learned that already , " she said with a little laugh . " She threatened to spank me if I did n't call you Harry . " " Well , I guess that makes it even , " I said . It was too bad there was n't a stenographer present . That brilliant conversation should really have been recorded for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " My name is Ruthie , of course  --  but all my  --  I mean  --  all my friends , they call me Betty . " She blushed a little . " I mean , if it 's all the same to  --  " " I get it , " I said , smiling reassuringly , and marking it up as dumb trick number one . " All right , then , Betty it is . " But it was n't . Betty did n't fit her . Ruthie was the wordp121for that softness that was the first thing you noticed about her . Not even Ruth . Just Ruthie . " Where have you been keeping yourself all these years since we lived on Fox Street ? " I said . " I do n't seem to remember you at all . " " Oh , we 've been living there all this time , " she said . " Gee whiz , " I said , " that must be every bit of , let 's see  --  we moved from Fox Street before I was bar mitzvah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been about ten or eleven  --  say , that makes it every bit of twelve or thirteen years , does n't it ? " " It certainly does , " she said . " Boy , " I said , " how time flies ! " Well , I guess we were both doing our bit toward making this one of the high spots in my conversational career . " What do you do during the day ? " I said . She began to look more at home at once . Well , I asked for it . " I 'm secretary to one of the partners in a large law firm downtown , " she said , smoothing the dress over her crossed knees . " It 's interesting work , but the hours are long . I do n't usually get home as early as this . " Was I flattered ! " You do n't get home so early yourself , do you ? " " No , " I said . " I 'm rather busy downtown until six or seven and I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm having an important business friend to dinncr , and so I came home a little early . " " Oh , " she said , and the smile went out of her face . Ah , well , another conquest ! " I 'm terribly sorry , " I said , leaning forward with my elbows on my knees . " It 'll probably be very boring for you to listen to us discuss business all night . But I did n't know you were coming , and it 's too late now to head this friend of mine off . He 's due here any minute , " I said , looking at my watch . What the hell was I apologizing for ? " Oh , that 's perfectly all right , " she said in that pleasant voice of hers , and her face broke into the smile again . I leaned back on the sofa and found myself smiling , too , in spite of myself . " I suppose I really should n't have butted in on you on such short notice . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a pleasure . " " Well , it 's nice of you to say that , anyway , " she said . " I mean it , too , " I said , and just then the bell rang . " Excuseme a moment , while I answer that , " I said , jumping up . Now I knew what the bell between rounds meant to a fighter . Another minute and I 'd have said something I 'd be sorry for . What the hell was the matter with me ? Maybe I was trained too fine . " Hello , Meyer , " I said , taking his hand with a good deal more warmth than he was entitled to . It felt strange to be thankful for the arrival of a kluck like Meyer Babushkin . " Right on time , eh ? " " Yeah , " he said . " Well , come on in , " I said , leading him toward the livingroom . " Meyer , " I said , " I want you to meet a friend of mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " While they were shaking hands , Mother came in and I introduced Meyer again . " Well , " Mother said , " now we 're all here , I could put the supper on the table , no ? " " Ma ! " I said reprovingly , " Not supper . Dinner ! " " Well , Mr. Smart One , " Mother said to me , " it 's not dinnereither . What do you think of that ? It 's just blintzes ! " Everybody laughed and I said , " Well , whatever it is , let 's go in and eat it . " I moved over toward Ruthie and took her arm to leadp123her to the kitchen . I saw Mother looking at me with a suppressedsmile , but I could n't avoid giving her that much satisfaction . I wanted to find out if she was as soft to the touch as she was to the look . She was . Not flabby , but firm , and at the same time soft and tender and warm . In spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose , there was something appealing about her . She was n't my speed , but I figured that while I was saddled with her for dinner , I might just as well amuse myself by trying to find out what it was . Mother had four chairs arranged around the kitchen table , and she had Ruthie sitting directly across from me , so that while I could n't do much talking , I could watch her . As soon as the blintzes were served , I had another mark to chalk up in her favor . She handled a fork like it was something with which to carry food to your mouth , not like it was a thermometer that had just been used on a typhoid case . " Oh , Mrs. Bogen , " she said , leaning toward Mother and smiling , " these are delicious ! " Mother beamed . " You like them , hah ? " " I certainly do , " she said , " they 're wonderful ! " " All right , " Mother said , " so after supper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a handy thing for a girl to know . " Hey , Mom ! Enough is enough ! I turned to Babushkin . " How 're they coming , Meyer ? " I said . " Fine , " he said , with his mouth full . " Very good . " It was a good thing I had an opinion of my own about those blintzes , because I never would have been tempted to try them on his recommendation . " I lave some more , " I said , loading up his plate.  | When we finished I lit a cigarette and passed the pack toward her . " Have one ? " I said . " No thanks , " she said with a pleasant little shake of the head , " I do n't smoke . " I was glad she did n't say it like she was showing off a medal . " Well , then , now , look , " I said , leaning on the table with my elbows . " Mr. Babushkin and I , here , we have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of excuse us , we 'll go into the living room and get it over with . But do n't you run away , now , " I said , shaking my finger at her and kicking myself at the same time . " We wo n't be long . " " Do n't worry , " Mother said , waving us away . " I 'm going to teach her how to make blintzes . So go already , go , with your business . All the time business , business , business , business , business , business , business ! " I laughed and got up and Babushkin followed . We went through the foyer to the living room and I pointed to the armchair . " Take a seat , Meyer , " I said , and sat down on the sofa , facing him . " Well , Meyer , " I said , cheerfully , " how are things up at Pulbetkal ? " " Oh , you know . Just about the same . " " Struggling along , eh ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How 's my friend Mr. Pulvermacher ? I 'll bet he do n't feel so good this week . He probably only made three milliondollars this week instead of the six he usually makes ? Hah ? " He smiled a little . The way he did it you 'd think it was against the law . " Well , that 's the dress business for you , " I said . " If you'vep125got a good combination , you can make money faster than the mint . That Pulvermacher , he must be worth all kinds of dough . " He did n't look very happy and he began to chew on his thumbnail . " You make up your mind yet on that thing we were talking about the other day ? " I said . He swallowed the piece of thumbnail he had in his mouth and began to talk to the floor . " I 'll tell you , Mr. Bogen , " he said slowly , " I been thinking about it , you know , I been thinking about it a lot , but , well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing you know , that , well , aah , I do n't know  --  " " Sure it 's a big thing , " I said . " But all good things are big . " Oh , yeah ? " That 's not really an objection , is it ? Be . cause if that 's all that 's  --  " " No , " he said . " It 's not that . It 's just that , well , you know , you ca n't be sure what 's gon na happen . Like this , now , at least I know I got a good job , and every week , regular , like clockwork , I get  --  " I love this . " Listen , Meyer , " I said quietly , putting my hand halfwayacross the small room so I could touch his arm . " You 're no baby and I 'm not going to talk to you like you were a baby . I 'm not going to give you any of this nothing ven-t tired nothing gained stuff . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe you 're even a little older  --  how old are you , Meyer ? " " Twenty-six and a half . " " So it 's just like I said . You 're even a little older than I . itn . So there 's no sense in my trying to give you advice or anything like that . But one thing you and I know , Meyer . When you go into business , nobody goes around giving you a written guarantee you 'll make a million dollars the first month . It 's a risk . Everybody takes a risk . Do n't forget , Meyer , I have a running business of my own that I 'm steppingout of . I do n't have to tell you that . And how about Mr. Ast ? He 's the crack salesman there for Toney Frocks , you think he 's not thinking twice before he goes in for this thing ? You can just about bet he 's thinking about it . And so am I , too . We 're all thinking about it . But a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't go on working for anotherman all your life . You have to make a break some time . You 've been on Seventh Avenue longer than I have , Meyer . " This was true . " And you know a little more about it than I do . " But this was n't . " But in my business , the way I have to keep circulating around all the time , keeping in contact with all my clients , my accounts , I pretty nearly get into every dress house in the industry . I sort of get the feel of the way things are running a little better than somebody else . Every place I go , what do I hear ? All I hear is what a great line Pulbetkal is got this season . Every place it 's the same thing . Pulbetkal is got a line that 's hot . ' That Pulvermacheris some little smart one , all right . ' ' Look at the business he 's doing . " Look at the line he 's got . ' All day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear . But nobody is kidding me , Meyer . Why is Pulbetkal 's line hot ? Why is Pulvermacher , Betschmann &; Kalisch , Inc. making so much money ? BecausePulvermacher is got a bald head , or because he wears glasses with a black ribbon , or because he smokes twentycentcigars , or maybe because he 's president of the AssociatedDress Manufacturers ? All that stuff is the bull . Pulvermacheris cleaning up because in the back , in his factory , he 's got the best factory man on Seventh Avenue , a man that also happens to be one of the best designers in the business . He 's got Meyer Babushkin . " It 's a funny thing about spilling the crap . If you don'tp127watch out the way you sling it , you 're liable to get snowed under yourself . " So Pulvermacher 's got the dough , " I said , " and what has this Meyer Babushkin got ? " I know , teacher ! He 's got a corking puss to sling manure at ! " He 's got a job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , but just the same , that 's all it is , a job . But if this Babushkin was to step out for himself , if he was running his own factory , and it was his own line he was making hot , not only would he still be the best factoryman and designer on Seventh Avenue , but he 'd also be getting the money that 's really his , and that right now he 's not getting , but that Pulvermacher is . " He kept nodding slowly as I talked , although the worried look still remained on his face . The look did n't mean anything , though . It was the way he always looked . The important thing was that he was nodding . But I was n't really convincinghim . He was convinced right from the start , before I even began . The same would 've been true of any one of the thousands of heels you find on Seventh Avenue . Go out into the street blindfolded and reach out . The first guy you 'll touch will react the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every factory man , every shipping clerk , every one of them is dying to go into the dress business for himself . And every one of them does , sooner or later . So I was n't really convincing Babushkin . He was just yellow , that 's all . And I was playing substitute for a backbone . " Like I said before , Meyer , we ca n't get any written guarantees . But I ask you , how can we miss ? " I was asking , but I was n't waiting for any answers . I was young and healthy and wanted to enjoy life . I could n't afford to waste the best years of my youth waiting for a molasses-brain like that to frame an answer to a question . " We 've got a combination that 's practically sure-fire . Look . We 've got you , the best I.1 ( t ory man and designer on the Avenue . You 've been coin- ing money for Pulvermacher , Betschmann 8c Kalisch , Inc. for years . Is there any reason why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And even better , too ? The chances are that when you 're in your own business , Meyer , you 'll be even better than you ever were . So all right . We 've got you . Then we 've got Teddy Ast . Maybe he is n't so wonderfula salesman as you 're a factory man . I mean , that 's just between the two of us , and I would n't want it to go any further . But he certainly is one of the best in the business , is n't he ? Look what he 's been doing for Toney Frocks . They have n't had a line worth a  --  a  --  excuse the expression , Meyer , but they have n't had a line worth a fart in I do n't know how many years . Yet year after year they turn in a profit . Why is that ? Because they 've got Teddy Ast . They 've got a salesman there that could sell  --  I do n't know , he could sell anything . And then there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know what to say . There 's just no limit to the money we can make . " I lit a cigarette and gave him a breathing spell . " And then , " I went on , " if you 're really worried about those things . I mean , " I said carelessly , " if the worst comes to the worst , in case the whole world is all of a sudden crazy , and we do n't make a go of it , why , then , Meyer , you can take my word for it , you 'll still have nothing to worry about . Pulbetkal will grab you back so fast , I mean just in case you ever want to go back , they 'll grab you back so fast , you 'll be dizzy . And you 'll be able to come back on your own terms , too . They 'll respect you more , too . Aah , " I said , waving my hand at him , " but what am I talking about ! We wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crazy ? I 'm so positive we 're gon na clean up , Meyer , I 'm so positive , that I 'm even gon na borrow some extra money so that we can start off with a little more decent capital . " I reminded myself not top129get excited . I was only talking . I never borrow . " That 's how positive I am about this thing . " He turned his worried squash in my direction , but there was no change in the way it looked . So I was willing to consider it a step forward . After all , Einstein says everything is relative . " You really think we 'll have enough to go into business ? " he asked doubtfully . " Do I think we 'll have enough ? " I said . " Look . Let 's see what we 've got . First there 's you . You said six last time , did n't you ? " He nodded slowly . " All right , then , we have six . Then there 's Ast . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? Well , all right , it does n't matter . Let 's say four . So your six and his four makes ten . After all , we ca n't expect him to have more . You know how those things are . He 's a salesman . They ca n't save any money . If it is n't clothes it 's entertainmentand this and that and God alone knows what . They spend twice as much as they make . Every cent they make is on their backs . Every one of them has twenty-seven suits and twenty-seven cents . It 's yet a wonder to me , Meyer , that he 's got the four . But anyway , that 's the way it is . So far we have ten . And me , last time I said seven , did n't I ? Well , I 'm gon na borrow three or four extra , like I just told you . That 'll make ten or eleven from me . So what 've we got ? We 've got twenty thousand dollars or over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know what we can do with twenty thousand dollars ? We can start three dress houses not one . I 'll bet three-quarters of the dress houses in the neighborhoodstart with a capital of less than ten . And plenty of them start with five , too . But what 's the sense of my telling you things like that ? You 've been in the dress business too long for me to tell you these things . You know all aboutp130these things . " I certainly was taking a lot for granted . " Of course we 've got enough . We 've got enough to not only start , but to start off with a bang . " Suddenly I heard the front door open and close and then I heard Mother 's footsteps walking back through the foyer to the kitchen . And all at once I had it . I knew what it was in that girl 's face that had puzzled and attracted me and had kept going around and around in my mind all the time I had been talking . I saw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the difference in their ages . She had that same way of making you feel rested just by looking at her that Mother had . I could sit there , in the same room with a dope like Babushkin , and think of that girl 's face as it had looked across the table from me in the kitchen , and I got that same feeling of having reached a place where I could drop my guard and draw my breath after having gone through something tough . I did n't like the idea of Mother 's footsteps having gone back to the kitchen alone . I wanted to see that girl again and talk to her . But I could n't until I got rid of Babushkin . " So do n't worry about it , Meyer , " I said , talking quickly . " We 're as good as in right now . " He waved that worried face of his up and down in front of me a few times . It was the best thing he did . " So what do you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comingtoward him . " Are we in this thing together ? " He nodded slowly , but that did n't mean anything to me any more . For all I knew he might have been saying no . " I think so , " he said , and I was surprised that his voice did n't break . " Just give me a little more time to think it over , give me a chance I should talk it over with my wife , and I 'll let you know , " he said . Suddenly I had an idea . Maybe I ought to meet his wife . I wanted to hurry this along a little . If he could n't make upp131his mind , she 'd make it up for him soon enough . And if he could talk her into marrying him , I could talk her into anything . " I 'll tell you what , Meyer , " I began , and stopped . Maybe it would be better if I did n't go around looking for trouble . She might not be as dumb as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spend any more time with him just then . I wanted to get back into that kitchen . " What ? " he said . " Nothing , " I said , giving him his hat and walking him toward the door . " You think it over and I 'll get in touch with you in a couple of days . " It was better not to get him nervous by trying to clinch it right then and there . Besides which , it was faster , too . " Okay , Meyer ? " " Yeah , " he said , nodding a little . " I guess that 'll be best . " " Good night , then , " I said . " Good night , " he said . I closed the door behind him and hurried toward the kitchen.  |p132MOTHER  was alone in the kitchen , darning socks , when I got there . " Hello , Mom , " I said , " where 's your company ? " " What do you mean , where 's my company ? " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take a look at the clock . " I did . It was a quarter to eleven . " Holy smoke , " I said , " was I in there that long ? " " Well , " she said with a shrug , " you was n't out here , so you must 've been in there , no ? " " What happened to Ruthie ? " " She went home . What do you think happened to her ? To sit here and wait for you to get finished with the business in there , a person could have a hemorrhage , God forbid . The girl has to go to work to-morrow . She ca n't sit around a half a night with an old woman like me while you 're inside with those high-class friends of yours . " " What 's the matter with my friends ? " I said . " Nothing is the matter with your friends , " she said . " Did I say something was the matter with your friends ? Only tell me , Heshie , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gon na be your new partner , the one you were telling me about ? " " That 's one of them , " I said . " What do you think of him ? " " He 's all right , I suppose , " she said , biting off the threadfrom a freshly darned sock . " He 's your partner , not mine . " " Okay , okay , " I said , sitting down at the table with herp133and grinning , " let 's have it . What do you think of him ? " " Of course , it 's none of my business  --  " she began . " I know , " I said , " but since when does that stop you ? " She flicked a sock at me and I ducked . " Well , to me , " she said , " if you really want to know  --  " " Yeah , I want to know . " " To me , " she said , " he looks like a high-class dope . " " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's all I wantedto hear . Now I 'm positive I 'm going into business withhim . " " What 's the matter ? " she said . " Ca n't you find any smart people in this world , you got ta go around picking out such schlemiels like that  --  ? " " I do n't need smart people , " I said . " I 'm smart enough for three . But dopes , the right kind of dopes , they 're hard to find . " " Remember only one thing , Heshie , " she said . " To be entirely smart is to be half a fool . " " Yeah , I know , Ma , " I said . " Papa used to tell me that , too . " " Well , Papa was right , Heshie . " " Let 's not go into that now , Ma , " I said . " Let 's stick to my dope of a partner , Meyer Babushkin " " I do n't know why a person with a little smartness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Let 's talk better about smart people . How do you like Ruthie ? " " Not Ruthie , Ma , " I said , raising my hand with the thumb and forefinger forming a circle , " Betty , Ma . She does n't want to be called Ruthie . She wants to be called Betty . " " All right , so it 's Betty . Betty , Ruthie , what 's something the difference ? How do you like her , that 's the question ? " " I low should I know how I like her ? " I said with a shrug.  | " Before I even got a chance to take a good look at her , she ran away home . " " Well , she did n't run away to Europe . You know where she lives . I got the telephone number . Maybe you do n't want to call from here , " she said slyly . " You want to take a good look at her , you want to see what she looks like , so you take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call her up , and then you go over to her house on Fox Street and you take a look at her . Is that sci hard to do ? " It would n't be hard . It would be crazy . " It 's not hard , " I said , " but it takes too much time . I 'm too busy . I ca n't bother with those things . " " What 's the matter , the whole world business fell all of a sudden on your head ? One night a week to call up a nice girl like that you have n't got ? " I would n't even spend a whole night on the right kind of girl . So what chance did a nice girl have ? " It 's not that , Ma , " I said . " I 'm planning a new business , too , you know . I 've got to see my partners . I 've got to arrange for capital . You know , Ma , all that  --  " " Who says that by calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrupted , smiling . " All right  --  Betty . Who says that by calling up Ruthie you 'll be wasting time ? " Nobody had to say it . I could tell by looking at her . " I did n't say I 'd be wasting time , Ma , " I said . " She 's anice girl and all that , and I got nothing against her . " Not yet , anyway . " You got nothing against her ! " Mother cried , shaking her head from side to side . " She 'll gain ten pounds when I tell her that my Heshie said he 's got nothing against her ! Since when , Heshie , since when you think you 're yourself Count Itufski 's son ? He 's got nothing against her ! " I laughed and lit a cigarette.  | " All right , all right , Ma , " I said , " I did n't mean it that way . I only meant that I ca n't spare the time now . I have to look after my new business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mother said . " Now that you 're so smart , and you talked so much , so I 'll tell you something . It would n't hurt you or that new business of yours if you should go out with Ruthie Rivkin . Now what do you think of that ? " " What do you mean ? " I asked . " Nothing , " Mother said with exaggerated casualness . " Only Mrs. Rivkin told me that the boy that marries her Ruthie , that boy gets ten thousand dollars to go in business with , that 's all . " He ought to get a medal , too . " Stop kidding me , Ma , " I said . " No grocer on Fox Street is giving away ten thousand dollars with a daughter . " " So maybe you know better than the whole world , " she said . " But I 'm telling you one thing . The boy that marries Ruthie  --  " " Betty , " I said . " All right  --  Betty . The boy that marries Ruthie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . Now what do you think of that ? " She 'd never forgive me , if I told her . " What 's the matter ? " I said . " Is she so hard to get rid of ? " " What do you mean , hard to get rid of ? You saw her , did n't you ? " " Well , I sort of did get a quick look at her before she breezed out of here , " I admitted . " Never mind , " Mother said , " do n't get so smart . If you did n't see her for long enough , it was your own fault , you were so busy with that big lemon of yours , that Babushkin . But you saw her . And you know there 's plenty boys they would thank God seven days a week for the rest of their lives if they could only get a nice girl like that even without ten thousand dollars . And with ten thousand dollars , do n't worry , there 's plenty boys in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they figure it 's worth while they should spend a couple nights a week in the parlor there by the Rivkins on Fox Street . " She probably had a younger sister that was a knockout . " Then how come nobody grabbed her off yet ? " I said . " What 's the matter ? She looks like a cripple to you , maybe ? She 's got a glass eye ? One leg is by her shorter than the other ? She 's a good-looking girl , dope . She 's particular , too , you dope , you ! " " Ma , please , " I said , " do n't call me dope . " " Why not ? " she said . " Maybe you 're something better ? " " Maybe , " I said . " But do n't call me dope . " " If you had any sense in that head of yours  --  that head that you think is the smartest one the Above One ever made  --  instead of wasting your time on lemishkes like Meyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand dollars , and you could go into business the way you want to and you would n't need any stupid partners they should get in the way of your feet when you walk . " " I do n't need Babushkin for his money only , Ma , " I said . " I need him because he 's a designer , a factory man . Do n't you understand that ? " " Anything you understand , " she said acidly , " you can be sure I understand , too . Do n't think the whole world smartness settled all of a sudden in your head , Heshie . What do you think , it 's going to hurt that business of yours if you have an extra ten thousand dollars in it ? " " Of course not , Ma . Ten thousand dollars  --  " "  --  Is ten thousand dollars , " she finished . " And it is n't every day in the week a young boy your age gets a chance to put his hands on so much money and at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p137I  started to correct her again , but stopped . I liked the idea of Mother 's not being able to talk of her in any way but as Ruthie . " And I 'll tell you something else , " Mother said , leaning across the table to poke her finger with the thimble on it at me . " She likes you . " " Yeah , she likes me , " I said . " What did you do , show her a picture of me ? She hardly even saw me . How do you know she likes me ? " That was one to stop the presses for . Harry Bogen reaching for a compliment ! " She told me , " Mother said . " Yeah , she told you ! When ? " " After supper , when I was teaching her how to make blintzes , " she said . " Oh , boy , Ma , " I said , grinning suddenly and shaking my head , " if I told you before , I 'll tell you again  --  would you make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never mind with that talk , " she said . " I 'm not a marriagebroker . But for my own son , I want he should get a nice girl . Is there anything wrong in that ? " " Not if she 's got ten thousand dollars , too , " I said , " there is n't . " " So what do you say , Heshie ? " " Well , all right , " I said , " give me her phone number . For you , Ma , I 'll do it . " She grinned at me . " You should live so , you little tramp , you , " she said , the grin turning into a laugh . " For me you 'll do it ! "  |p138I  WAS sitting there , looking at the phone on my desk . When I finally made up my mind to put the call through I glanced at the clock . It was six-thirty . That meant Miss Marmelsteinwas gone and I 'd have to go out to the switchboard to dial the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walked out into the large room . She was still sitting behind the switchboard , toying with the plugs and staring at her hands . She looked up as I came into the room . " Why , what are you doing here so late ? " I said . " You do n't have to stick around as late as all this , Miss Marmelstein , you know . " " Oh , that 's all right , Mr. Bogen , " she said eagerly . " I have n't got anything special to do to-night , anyway . " My heart bled for her . " Did you want something , Mr. Bogen ? " she asked . " Yes , " I said . " Get me Intervale 9-929-no , never mind . Forget it . " I turned on my heel and went back into my private office . For another moment I stood at my desk , hesitating . Then I said , " The hell with it , " and reached for my hat . " I 'm going up to Toney Frocks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her on the way out . " If anybody calls me , and it 's important , you can probably reach me there for the next quarter of an hour or so . Otherwise , do n't bother . You can close up any time you want to . Good night . " " Good night , Mr. Bogen , " she said lingeringly.  |p139I  did n't even turn back . She could n't kid me . I was n't that good . When I reached Toney Frocks the girl at the information window was fixing her hat in her pocket mirror which she had propped up against her switchboard . " I 'd like to see Mr. Ast , " I said , " Teddy Ast . " " Mr. Ast is gone , " she said without looking up . " Any message ? " " No , " I said , " no message . What time does he usually get in in the morning , do you know ? " " Yes , I do , " she said , " but he wo n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He went away for the week end . He wo n't be back till Monday . " " Oh ! " I said , and stood there , hesitating . I could n't make up my mind whether I was sorry or not . The evening was free now , and there was no excuse for not making the call . " Where did Mr. Ast go for the week end , do you know ? " " Totem Manor , " she said ; then , " say  --  ! " " That 's all right , " I said , " I 'm a friend of his . " I went back to the elevator , pushed the button , and got in . I was watching the lights at the top of the car that winked on and off to indicate the floor we were passing . When the light for " 18 " went on I made up my mind . " Okay , " I said to myself and put my hand in my pocket for a nickel . I went into a phone booth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman 's voice got on the wire . " Hello . " " Hello , " I said , " is this Intervale 9-9294 ? " " Yes . " " Is Ruthie home ? " " You mean Betty , no ? "  | I guess whoever she was , she had her orders . " Yeah , " I said , " that 's right . Is she home ? " " No , she 's not home yet . But I expect her any minute . Maybe you wan na leave a message ? " " We-ell , I do n't know . I 'll tell you , who 's this talking ? " " This is her mother . " " Oh , well , I 'll call again . Never mind . " " You sure you do n't want to  --  ? Oh , hello , hello ? " " Yes ? " " Here she is now , she just came in this minute . Hold the wire , please . " Well , here I go , I thought . After a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I recognized it immediately . " Hello ? " " Hello , " I said . Damn it , I should have cleared my throat . " Who 's this , Betty ? " " Yes . Who 's this ? " " This is Harry Bogen . Remember me ? " " Why , of course , " she said with a laugh . " What ever made you think I would n't ? " " I do n't know , " I said . " You know how those things are . " I guess she had me hypnotized all right . I could n't evenmake the properly sarcastic comebacks that her remarksreally earned for her . And the hell of it was that I didn'tthink it was the ten thousand dollars Mother said they werepassing out to the guy that carried her to the altar , either . " Oh , I do n't forget people as easily as all that , " she said . " That 's where you 've got it over most girls , then , " I said . " Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " shesaid . " I do n't think I am , " I said . " Not of girls in general , anyway . "  |p141The  next step was epigrams . God , how do I get into these things ? " Well  --  " she began , and paused . That was better . At least we were back on safe ground again . " Look , " I said , " I did n't call so we could have a long discussion about girls in general . I like to be more specific than that . " She laughed and I was glad I was at the other end of the phone to hear it . " All right , " she said , " be more specific . " " Well , what are you doing to-night ? " I asked . " Oh  --  I do n't know . Nothing special , I guess . Why ? " I 'm the inquiring photographer , and I 'm conducting a poll to discover how many girls  --  aah , nuts . " Then suppose we do it together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " All right , " she said . " Fine , " I said . " Now , where would you like to go ? " " Oh  --  I do n't care . Any place at all that you say . It does n't make any difference to me . " If she did n't come from Fox Street and Mama had n't introduced her to me and there was n't something about her face and voice that warmed you all over in spite of the fact that your common sense told you at a glance that she was n't pretty  --  if it was n't for all that , I 'd know where to take her all right . But like this I was stopped . " It does n't make any difference to me , either , " I said . " But anything you like I 'm sure I 'll like too . So just say the word , " I said . " Well , then , let 's see . Oh , I know . I 'll tell you what I 'd really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like to go up to the Stadium Concert , " she said.  | Well , that 's what I got for asking for suggestions . " Okay with me , " I said , " if you really want to go . " " Oh , I 'd love it . They 're having a special Viennese programto-night and Albert Spalding is the soloist . " " Who ? " " Albert Spalding . " " Yeah , well , I guess we 'll have to go then , that 's all . Let 's see , now , what time is it ? " I looked at my wristwatch . " Seven o'clock , " she said . " That 's right , " I said . " Now , then , when do these  --  when does this concert start ? " " Eight-thirty , I think . " " That gives me an hour and a half to get the tickets and to come up to your  --  " " Oh , you do n't have to do that , " she said quickly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bronx and back ? " That 's just what I was trying to figure out . " Why do n't you go up to the Stadium , get the tickets , and then I 'll meet you at  --  well , any place you say . " " Well , I 'll tell you the truth , " I said , " I do n't know much about the neighborhood up there  --  " " All right , " she said , " here , I 've got it . The Stadium , you know , is on Amsterdam Avenue between a Hundred and Thirty-eight and a Hundred and Thirty-Seventh Streets . Across the street , I mean across the Avenue , is the Hebrew Orphan Asylum . Suppose we meet there , right in front of the main entrance to the Orphan Asylum ? " " That 's the first time I ever met a girl in front of an orphan asylum , " I said with a laugh . Come on , Bogen , be natural . She 's not paying you . You do n't have to laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll do it . " " Thank you , kind sir , " she said sweetly , " I 'm  --  " I felt my face wrinkle up as I scowled into the mouth/piece . Before I knew I was talking , I said , " Do n't ever say that , " sharply . " Do n't say what ? " " Nothing , " I said quickly . " I mean  --  I 'll tell you when I see you . " " But I do n't understand . What were we talking about ? " " I was saying that this is the first time I ever arranged to meet a girl in front of an orphan asylum , but for you I 'd do it . " Her voice , when she spoke , was suddenly sharp and cool . " And I was about to say , " she said , " that I was ' going to consider that a compliment . Would you mind telling me what 's wrong in that ? " " Nothing , " I said quickly . " And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? " " A compliment , " I said . " Then what did you mean when you said  --  ? " " It 's not important , " I said . " I 'll tell you when I see you . " " All right , " she said , laughing the way I liked to hear her , " then it 's the Hebrew Orphan Asylum at , say , eight-fifteen . " " Right , " I said , and hung up . During the next hour and a quarter I had a chance to call myself as many different kinds of horse 's ass as I could think of . And I could think of plenty . But after I 'd gone through the whole list , it still did n't help . The fact remainedthat I was going to a concert and , worse than that , that I was actually looking forward to it . I could think of an answer , of course . I knew how to read and understand English , and I 'd seen a movie or two in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to be . But I was damned if I 'd admit that a thing like that could happen to me.  |p144But  being certain of immunity could n't change the fact that I was pacing around nervously in front of an orphan asylum on Amsterdam Avenue , all but biting my nails , waiting for what my common sense told me was as Jewishlookinga broad as I 'd ever seen in my life . Hell , I said finally , I guess the smartest of us will do more for ten thousand dollars than we 're willing to admit . When I saw her turn the corner into Amsterdam Avenue , I went forward to meet her . " Hello , " I said , taking her arm , " I was beginning to get scared that you would n't show up . " " Oh , I do n't think you were scared , " she said . That 's how much she knew about it . " Well , maybe  --  " I said , staring at her . She looked frightened and began to examine her dress and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked . " No , " I said , still staring hard , " nothing 's wrong . I 'm just trying to discover two things . " " What ? " " Whether you look the same as you did the other night when we had blintzes , " I said , " and whether you 're as pretty as my mother keeps saying you are . " She blushed suddenly and looked down at her hands with an embarrassed smile and for the first time in my life I knew what it meant to want to kiss a girl . I mean , just to kiss her . " Oh , I think your mother is  --  I mean , she 's too  --  " " Maybe she is , " I said , still staring . " But I do n't think so . " Well , " she said in a slightly higher-pitched tone of voice , " shall we go in ? " " We might as well , " I said , putting my arm through hers . It was amazing how warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a light summer coat . " I got the best seats in the house . " " You mean the ones at the tables downstairs ? " she said , stopping . " Yeah . " " Oh , you should n't have done that . It 's  --  " " Forget it , " I said , patting her arm . " They 're only a dollar and a half a piece . " " It is n't that , " she said . " But it 's so much nicer in the fifty cent seats , high up in the Stadium . " " You mean way up there on those stone seats ? " She nodded . " It 's not as comfortable as the ones downstairs , " she said , " but they 're not as uncomfortable as they look . And it 's really much more  --  well , sort of private . But it does n't matter . If you have these already , why  --  " " Just a moment , " I said . I took the tickets out of my pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gutter . " Oh ! " she said , " you should n't  --  " " Why not ? " I said , remembering to kick myself . I do n't like that kind of cheap flash . " No sense in sitting out in the open like an actor on a stage with the whole world staring at you . I should 've had more sense than to buy those tickets , anyway . Come on , we 'll get a couple of those other tickets . " There was quite a crowd going in when I stopped to buy two of the cheaper tickets . It never occurred to me that there were that many people in the world who were willing to spend money to sit on stone steps and listen to music . Well , and I guess it never occurred to me that I 'd be one of them , either . " Let 's go over toward this end , " she said , leading me toward the left . " We can climb up to the top row there , and it wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and toward the right . " " You seem to know a lot about this place , do n't you ? " I said . " Oh , I come here pretty often , " she said . " Alone ? " I asked . She blushed and I was sorry I 'd asked . " Sometimes , " she said awkwardly . " Sometimes with some other girls or some  --  " " Hold it a second , " I said . " I want to get a couple of these . " I bought two straw mats from a boy that was selling them , and we continued to climb the wide cement steps . " You do n't really need them , " she said . " It 's just as comfortablesitting on the stone . " " I suppose , " I said . But I could n't imagine her sitting on anything so hard and not hurting herself seriously . " This ought to be about right , " she said finally , and I spread the mats on the cement step and we sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right of us . It was getting dark quickly , but there was still enough light to see the tiers , arranged like the rays from a flashlight , and how crowded they were . Down below , at the focus of the rays , was the orchestra , with the men tuning their instruments . The sky was blue with a few stars beginning to show and a handful of clouds moving across it slowly . I had n't looked at the sky for a month . Somehow you get out of the habit downtown . " It 's nice , is n't it ? " she said . I nodded and looked around at the people near us . Most of them were couples of about our own age ; they were sitting very close to one another and were whispering and holding hands and laughing for all the world as though they were alone up there . And none of them paid any attentionp147to the others . I considered it a good sign . They had sense . Just as the music started she turned to me suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , but I forgot in all the excitement about the tickets . What was it you meant when you said to me on the phone before , ' Do n't ever say that , ' or something like that ? " It was pretty dark , now , and the only lights were down in the center of the Stadium , with the orchestra . " Oh , I guess I did n't mean anything , " I said . " Let 's just forget it . " That marked another first in my life . For once I was afraid to say something to a dame . " But you must have , " she said , looking at me . " I could tell by the way you said it , all of a sudden . " " Well , I 'll tell you , " I said . " I do n't know if I can exactly tell you what I mean . And then , again , " I added , " maybe you wo n't like it . So suppose we skip the whole thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please , " she said . " I 'd rather you told me . " It was the first time she 'd called me by my given name . And the way she said it made the skin and the little hairs on the side of my jaw stand up and tingle . Well , at least I could say she had better manners than Babushkin . " Well , it 's like this , " I said . " Maybe I do n't know you long enough to go around telling you these things , but hell , the way I figure , I figure it 's important . So do n't get sore , or anything like that . Okay ? " " I promise , " she said , smiling , and I was sure she meant it . " All right , " I said . " Now do n't ask me for explanations or anything like that , because I ca n't give them to you . All I know is there 's something about you , let 's say about the way they put your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sit and walk and even talk  --  I heard it on the phone to-night  --  there 's something there that 's sort of soft and , well , I guess honest is the best word . Anyway , that 's the general idea , see ? And it reminds me a lot of my mother . And any girl that can do that , I mean remind me of my mother , must be pretty good . You follow me ? " She nodded a little , quickly , without looking at me . " Now , " I continued , " this is where it gets a little thick , but it 's the best I can do in the way of an explanation . I mean , if you only let yourself alone , if you only act natural , you can take my word for it you 're all right ; you ca n't go wrong . Anything you say or do , any way you sit or walk or I do n't know what , if you only do it natural , without addinganything fancy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out right and it 'll look and sound right , too . But the minute you try to add some of those touches , you know , the minute you try to do something different than what you would do if you let yourself alone , it sticks out like a sore thumb ; it just does n't ring right . Now take for instance to-night . We were talking there on the phone and everything was okay ; then , I do n't know exactly where it was , but all of a sudden you said something  --  yeah , I remember , now  --  I think you said something about Thank you , kind sir , ' or something like that . Anyway  --  now do n't get sore  --  it was , well , it was fake ; just like me tearing up that couple of tickets a little while ago was fake . It did n't sound like you and if you wan na really get right down to it , it was n't you talking . So the second you said it , it hit me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I forgot all those high-class manners my mother taught me and like a dope I was yelling Ouch , ' and I was telling you not to talk like that . Naturally , I got no right to tell you what  --  aah , hell , " I said suddenly , " what 's the sense of talking ? " " That 's all right , Harry , " she said quietly . " I know what you mean . "  |p149It  was nice to know that at least one of us did . " Then suppose we forget it , " I said , " and listen to the music . " " All right , " she said . We sat quietly for a while , and the music coming up made everything seem all right . Then I thought of something , and I said , " There 's one more thing . " " Yes ? " " What do you want to have people go around calling you Betty for ? " I said . " That 's not you . You 're Ruthie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ruthie , " I said , trying it out . " Ruthie . See , that sounds right . Because that 's you , you know . Ruthie , " I said again . " Well , that 's settled . Your friends , they can call you Betty , but me , I 'm different . " Boy , I was as casual as a freight car . I turned back to the orchestra below us . The music came up thin and tinkly and it suddenly occurred to me that I liked it . It was just right for that sort of place . " I never listened to this stuff before , " I said , " but it 's pretty good , is n't it ? " She did n't answer . She sat with her elbows on her knees , supporting her chin in her hands . A man in a white suit stood up under the lights and put a violin under his chin . " That 's Spalding , " she said , as he began to play . I put my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head on my shoulder . I leaned my head down and kissed her hair gently . She did n't move . The music stopped and we left the Stadium with the crowd . " How about a little bite of something to eat ? " I said.  | " I 'm not hungry , " she said , " but if you are  --  " " I 'm not , either , " I said . " Shall we walk a while ? " " All right , " she said . We went west , toward the river , and then walked downtown , arm in arm , without talking . In a dark spot , under a tree , we stopped and I tipped her face up toward me with my hand and kissed her on the mouth . It was all right . She shivered a little and said , " I 'm afraid I 'll have to be getting home , Harry . " " All right , " I said , and hailed a cab . I sat with my arm around her , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . After a while she coughed a little . " Well , " she said , " I guess we 'll , well , I guess we 'll be getting home soon . " " Yeah , " I said . " Was n't it nice ? " she said . " Yeah , " I said , without thinking . Then I looked at her quickly . " It was all right , " I added . She turned to look at me . " What 's the matter , Harry ? Did n't you like it ? " So far , what had there been to like ? " Yeah , sure , " I said . " I liked it . " That was just the trouble . What did I like about it ? It was n't the music , that was sure . And as far as I 'm concerned , a stadium is just a big draft . I guess I liked my mother so much , I got a kick out of taking her girl friends out . " It was all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at that . " Only I sort of hate to , well , you know , break the whole thing up right now . " A dame was a dame . She moved closer to me and put her head against my shoulder . I guess it 's all in the words you use . " Harry  --  " she began.  |p151I  put my other arm around her and drew her close . The cab stopped . What a spot ! That 's what you get when you have n't got a place to go . " Well , here we are , " she said in a quick , relieved voice . Yeah , home . We got out and I paid the driver . She stood on the stoop , hesitating . " Well , good night , " she said slowly . " Good night , " I said ; then , quickly , " hey , wait a minute ! " Where did she get off , making me behave like a gentleman ? " What are you doing to-morrow , Ruthie ? " What was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went out with her for the sake of her company ? " Nothing , " she said . " Why ? " " How would you like to run up to Totem for the day ? " What the hell , I had business up there anyway . I 'd kill two birds with one stone . " We could leave early  --  " " Oh , I could n't go to-morrow , Harry , " she said . " Why not ? " " It 's Saturday . My mother would n't let me ride on Sat-urday . " It was just as well to be warned in advance . Maybe her mother would n't let her do other things on Saturday , either . " Then suppose we make it for Sunday , then ? " " All right , " she said , opening the door and stepping into the hall . " I 'll tell my mother . " " Okay , " I said , smiling . " Tell her not to worry . " She 'd be doing that soon enough . But somehow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't help thinking that if I had to knock off a dame to prove I did n't like her , there was something wrong.  | I DID N'T say much on the train because I did n't know what she was thinking . Whatever it was , I could tell by her face that it was harmless . And I did n't want to jolt her into a series of questions . But I sat with my arm around her and every once in a while I asked her if she was comfortable . " I 'm comfortable , Harry , thanks , " she said , " only  --  " " Only what ? " " I 'm just a little worried if I 'm dressed right for a place like that , " she said . " Do n't be silly , " I said . " You 're all right . " She was wearing a blue sports dress with a pleated skirt and white trimmings , including a sailor collar with a white star in each corner . " You 're dressed better than most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . There were a half dozen busses around the station when we got off the train . I looked for the one with the sign TOTEM MANOR over it and walked toward it . I recognized a few people from Seventh Avenue in it when we took our seats , and nodded to them . " You know those people ? " she asked . " Sort of , " I said . " Not that they 're my friends , or anything like that , but it 's just that I do the delivery work for some of them . This Totem is a regular hangout for the garment industry . " I tried to figure out what I wanted to avoid most : these heels thinking I could n't pick myself anything better/looking than Ruthie Rivkin , or her thinking that these heels were my friends . About a dozen people got into the bus in all , and then it drove away . It went down the state road for a few miles and then turned into a private road for a half mile . It drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screened-in porches all around it . People were sitting in chairs on the lawn and on the porches . To the left were the tennis courts and the swimming pool , both crowded , and to the right , on a hill , was the first tee of the golf course that they spend sixty per cent of their advertising copy in describing . Around the large main building were the half dozen or so smaller ones , the annexes , in which they accommodatedthe guests that could n't be taken care of in the main house . Between the main house and the first annex was the very wide and square casino , where the social staff did its stuff after dinner . " Come on , Ruthie , " I said , " let 's go in and register . " We walked up the steps into the large lobby with the rustic furniture and the Seventh Avenue kibitzers . As I signed the register I asked the clerk , " Is there a Mr. Ast registered here for the week end , a Mr. Teddy Ast ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He pointed to the porch on the right of the desk . " There 's Mr. Ast now . " " Thanks , " I said , and to Ruthie , " Just a second , I want to see if that 's the guy I 'm looking for . " I walked over to the screen door and looked out . It was Ast all right , sitting in a steamer chair with a half dozen snappy-looking blondes surrounding him . I ducked away from the door quickly and walked over to Ruthie . " Look , " I said , walking her toward the other end of the lobby , toward the porch on the left of the desk , " I 've got to go out and talk to that guy for a few minutes . On business.  | You sit out here like a good girl for a while , and wait till I come back for you . All right ? " " Ca n't I sit out on the other porch while you 're talking to him ? " she asked . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know any of these people , and  --  " " Do n't be silly , " I said , laughing and pinching her cheek . " Nobody 's going to eat you up . " That 's all I 'd need . Ast . with his six blonde nifties , and me with Ruthie Rivkin of the Bronx ! " You want anything to read ? " I asked , when she was finally seated . " I 'll get you a magazine or something . " " No , that 's all right , Harry , thanks . I 'll just sit here and wait for you . Hurry , though , will you ? " " I sure will , " I said , patting her cheek again . As I left the porch to go into the lobby again I took a quick look around . I did n't know any of the people sitting there nor did they pay any attention to me . So that was all right . I walked across the lobby and threw open the door behindAst . He looked up and recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reaching out his hand . " Hello , there , Ast , " I said . " Meet the stable , " he said , waving his hand to take in the girls . They giggled crazily as though he 'd said the smartest thing they 'd ever heard . I had to hand it to the little kike . He was a skinny little runt , with a face that looked like it had been worked on often enough but never quite finished , and a nose that could have hidden the Statue of Liberty and a couple of ferryboats besides . But with all those handicaps , when it came to the women , he was all there . " Pull yourself over a chair , " he said , pointing toward an unoccupied rocker with one leg . " Thanks , " I said , and sat down.  | " When 'd you arrive , Bogen ? I did n't see you around last night . " " I just got in a few minutes ago , " I said . " When are you going back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hell of a trip for just one day , " he said . " What 's the matter , no more dames left in New York ? " The blondes laughed like they were getting paid for it and they 'd been promised a raise if they turned in a good performance . " No , not dames , " I said . " I came up here on business . " " Business ? " " Yeah , " I said . " I came up here to see you . " He dropped his legs to the ground and sat up in the chair . " Okay , girls , " he said , waving his hands at them , " scram for a while , will you ? I 've got business with Mr. Bogen , here . I 'll see you all later . " " Oh , Teddy , " one of the blondes said , pouting . " Come on , " he said , raising his voice . " Shoo ! " They shooed . " What 's up ? " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other night , " I said . " Yeah ? What happened ? " " Oh , my mother filled him full of food , and then I took him into the living room and talked his ear off for a couple of hours . " " How does it look ? " " Pretty good , " I said . " I think he 's in . He just wanted a little time to talk it over with his wife . He 's got one of those things , you know . " " Yeah , I know , " he said . He waved his hand understandingly . " A designer . Nu . He 's got ta have a steady position . "  |p156It  was n't funny . But he was expecting it . I laughed . " And he promised to let me know definitely on Monday . ' That 's to-morrow . " " But how does he look to you ? I mean , do you think there 's any chance of his getting cold feet or anything like that ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked pretty well set to me . It 's only that wife of his that I 'm worried about . " " Well , we ca n't help that , " he said . " But otherwise it looks okay , right ? " " Right , " I said . " Now , how about you ? " He lit a cigarette and shrugged . " . It 's hard to say , Bogen , " he said . " Right now I feel pretty sure I 'm in . But I 'm a funny guy . " He did n't have to advertise it . " Well , hell , " I said . " You ca n't  --  " " But do n't worry about me , " he said , holding up his hand to quiet me . " The way I look at it , I figure if we get the factory man , if we get Babushkin , then I 'm in . That enough ? " " Plenty , " I said . We shook hands . " I guess you 'll want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , getting up . " So I think I 'll  --  " " I 'm not anxious , " he said . " There 's dozens of them around . But how about you ? You want a knockdown to something ? " " No , thanks , " I said , " I 've got my hands full right now . " " Private stock , eh ? " he said , leering . " Yeah , " I said . " Pre-war . " He let out a short laugh and shook his head . " Not for me , " he said . " I do n't like them that old . " " They have their points , " I said . " They know a little more when they 're that age . "  | " I do n't care about that , " he said . " I teach them all they have to know . " " I guess they could n't want a better teacher , eh ? " I said . Look at me , handing out compliments ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a pleased shrug . Of course he was n't . He had too mild an adjective . " Say , " he said , " when are you going home  --  to-night ? " " Yeah , " I said , " I 've got to be in my office in the morn-ing . " " All right , " he said . " I 'm going back to-night , too . I 'll give you a lift home in my car . Okay ? " " Nah , I 'll tell you , Ast , " I said , " this tomato I got up here with me , she do n't like automobiles . " " What 's the matter , " he said , " is she that old ? " " No , " I said , " but she was in an accident once , and since then she 's been sort of  --  " " Well , okay , then , " he said . " Suit yourself . " " Thanks anyway , Ast , " I said , " but I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Okay , " he said . " So we 'll leave it this way , then , " I said , getting up . " As soon as Babushkin gets in touch with me  --  or maybe I 'll get in touch with him  --  yeah , that 'll be better , I 'll get in touch with him . And as soon as I get word from him one way or another , why , I 'll contact you . Okay ? " " Yeah , that 'll be all right . " " Maybe the three of us ought to have a little lunch or something together on Monday , so we could clean up the whole thing once and for all . " " That 's not a bad idea , " he said . Well , that made it even . I got my compliment back . " So I 'll see you Monday , then , Ast , " I said , holding out my hand.  | " Right , " he said , shaking it . " Just in case we miss each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So long , " I said , and went out into the lobby . I stopped at the desk and spoke to the clerk . " Do me a favor , will you ? " I said . " I just registered here this morning , and I 'm leaving to-night . For the two meals I 'm going to have here , I 'd like to have a small little table at one side of the dining room . In a corner , if possible . Do you think you can arrange it ? " He looked at me with a wise grin and puckered up his lips . I took out my wallet and slipped two singles across the desk . " A small table for two in as unnoticeable a corner as you can find in the dining room , " I said . " And the name is Bogen . Okay ? " " Why , I guess so , sir , " he said , taking the money . I went toward the other porch and stopped in the doorwayfor a moment , to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me going out . I took a look at Ruthie in the chair , staring out over the lawn , before I went over to speak to her . I should have known better than to take her to a joint like this . Somehow she did n't look as good in the sunlight at Totem Manor as she 'd looked in the moonlight at the Lewisohn Stadium . " Well , " I said , sitting down next to her , " did anybody take a bite out of you ? " " No , " she said , smiling that gentle smile of hers . " It 's lovely . I 'm really beginning to enjoy it . " " That 's fine , " I said . " That 's why I brought you out here . " There I go , lying again . " Did you meet the man you wanted to see ? " she asked . " Yes , " I said . " I hope everything was all right , " she said.  | " It was . " " Good , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if I was as successful with the second purpose of the trip as I 'd been with the first , maybe she would n't think so.  |p160EVERYTHING  was all right until lunchtime . I kept her moving around the place , showing her the sights , pointing out the Seventh Avenue big shots at play , avoiding people I knew . And when lunch was served , our table was far enough in one corner of the large dining room to prevent my having to make embarrassing introductions . I had one narrow squeeze when I saw Ast enter the diningroom late and stand for a few moments near the doorway , staring about him . " Be back in a minute , Ruthie , " I said , slipping out of my chair and walking toward Ast . " Hello , Bogen , " he said , still staring across the room as he spoke . " Alone again ? " " Yeah , " I said , moving past him as I talked . " The girl friend went out for a minute . I guess she must 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get your hands wet , " he said , and hurried across the room . The idea got me sore . I walked out into the lobby , bought a pack of cigarettes I did n't need , and came back . I looked the dining room over carefully before I sat down , but I did n't see Ast again . " I think what we 'll do , Ruthie , " I said , " is go out for a walk right after lunch and see if we ca n't find a nice quiet spot where we can lie down and take a little nap for a while . What do you say ? "  | " All right , if you want to , " she said . " I thought maybe we 'd take a swim , though . The pool looks so  --  " " I do n't think you better go in , " I said . " It 's still too early in the year . I do n't want you to catch a cold , you know . " " All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it because I saw those other people there , when we came in  --  " " Aah , they 're crazy , " I said . " Come on . " We walked across the lawn past the tennis courts till we were on a narrow footpath that led through the trees . Once we were out of sight of the other people I took her hand and walked along swinging it . " This is nice , is n't it ? " I said . She nodded slowly , with a smile . I guess she thought she had it all figured out . There it was , right on her face : he 'd rather make love than go swimming ! " It 's a relief to get away from those damn crowds for a while , " I said . She nodded again and I put my arm around her . I wanted to make up for any stitches I may have dropped during the morning by my maneuvers to avoid Ast . We walked in silence for a while until we reached a small cleared space at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the path toward a knot of trees , and ended with a big log lying across their base . Like in the movies . " This looks all right , " I said , " let 's try it . " I took off my slipover and spread it near the trees so she could sit on it and lean against the log . I helped her sit down and while she was arranging her skirts I parked myselfon the log , a little to one side of her and slightly above her . She leaned back and looked up at the sky through the branches of the trees . From the angle at which I was watching her , alone in the woods , without any fast blondes from Seventh Avenue to compare her with , she began to look again like she had looked the night of the concert . But it was n't getting me this time . I looked around the cleared space carefully , to make sure I 'd recognize it in the dark . For the rest , the darkness did n't worry me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a help than a handicap . The only thing that was going to be new to-night was the stage . I should have spent more time in the park . I let my hand drop to her shoulder and she reached up and took it , holding it there against that warm soft skin of hers that would have put a dame with an ounce of intelligenceand a decent-looking face in a Park Avenue penthousebefore she even learned how to make out bankdepositslips . The sweat began to gather in my palm , but I did n't take my hand away . We sat that way for a long time , with me stroking her hair every once in a while to keep her in the right state of mind . But under my hand her flesh grew warmer and warmer , melting away until I could feel the pulse come beating up against me . Now and then she dozed off , clutching my hand more tightly and smiling a little . My legs began to ache from the strain of holding myself against the trunk of the tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounding against my ears . The veins in my temples began to hurt . It got so that for a minute I forgot she was there . I could n't think . But I did n't let it worry me . My own feelings , I knew I could always take care of . I was on my way , and the detour signs did n't mean a thing . " We better be getting back , " I said finally . " Or we 'll miss dinner . " She smiled through her yawn and stretched delicately . The dress grew tight across her chest . Her head rolled back against the tree and she moved her shoulders in a quickp163happy shiver . I helped her to her feet . But from the way she got up I could tell she did n't want to go . We walked back slowly , without talking . After dinner the crowd went over to the casino . " Let 's go over , too , Harry , " she said . " I do n't know , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The social staff is putting on a show , " she said . " Do n't listen to their bragging , " I said . " I heard the girls talking in the ladies ' room , " she said . " They 're going to give Counsellor At Law . " These overpowering inducements were hell on a guy 's resolutions . " All right , " I said , " if you really want to . " I figured as long as it was going to be a show , it would be dark , anyway . The stage at the far end of the large social hall , or casino , was hidden by curtains , and the room was covered with loosely strewn chairs . At one side a six-piece band was playing and several couples were dancing . Most of them were in evening clothes , although there were quite a few , like us , who wore the same things they had worn during the ( lay . The slot machines and the bar at one side were getting quite a play . Ruthie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weave in and out among the scattered chairs and listening to the noises behind the curtains . She touched my arm and said , " Would you want to  --  to ( lance a little , Harry ? " What was she doing , trying to make it easy for me ? " Gee , I do n't think we ought to , Ruthie , " I said , smiling . " We 're not in evening clothes , you know , and , well , it 's not so  --  "  | " You 're right , " she said quickly . " I just thought maybe you wanted to , that 's all . " " I do n't , " I said , " but if you do , why , just say the word and we 'll  --  " " No , no , " she said , " That 's all right . " " Sure ? " I said , looking down into her face . From now on everything was build-up . Everything I said and did had to count . " Positive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crack at those slot machines , " I said , taking her arm and leading her toward them . I broke a five-dollar bill into quarters and gave her a handful . " Oh , no , Harry , " she said , pushing them back . " You play if you want to . I 'll just watch . " " Oh , come on , Ruthie , " I said , taking her hand . " Do n't be like that . " " No , please , " she said . " I 'd rather just watch . " " All right , then , " I said , " Maybe you 'll bring me luck . " But she did n't . I went through the five dollars , and another three , without cracking the jackpot . Somehow , aside from the ten thousand , she and money did n't seem to go together . By this time the people were beginning to take their seats for the show , and I found two near the door . It was a lucky thing I 'd seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized it from the way it was being murdered . The first act was lousy . And it did n't take me long after the curtain rose on the second act to see that it was n't much of an improvement . I leaned close to Ruthie and whispered in her ear . " What do you say we get out of here and go for a walk ? " I said . I took her hand and squeezed it a little . " This thing is terrible , anyway . "  | " All right , " she said . She was pretty good at these sweeping statements . We tiptoed out onto the lawn and stood for a moment , looking up at the sky . " It 's a lot like the night at the Stadium , is n't it ? " I said . " Yes , " she said . We walked across the lawn toward the tennis courts , swinging hands , until we reached the footpath . It was dark under the trees and I moved closer to her and put my arm around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked . When we reached the little cleared space , I stopped and said , " Let 's rest a while . " I spread my jacket near the log and helped her down . Then I sat down next to her and we sat in the pale light that filtered through the branches and the leaves , hugging our knees and watching the stars come out over us . It was very quiet . " Happy ? " I asked softly . " Uh-huh , " she said . I leaned back against the log and eased her to me , resting her head in the bend of my arm . She tipped her face up and I kissed her , hard , holding her to me . Her arm crept up around my neck and we remained like that for a few moments . This was going to be a pushover . I kissed her again , very softly , on the forehead , and her tense body relaxed in my arms . I put my hand on her belly and began to stroke her gently , feeling her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress and the underwear . Once she half raised her free arm , but she dropped it back on t he grass . I began to fumble with the buttons of her blouse , but she did n't stop me . The last thought I had in my head was that I was n't feeling the way I thought I would . I felt quiet and warm and did n't care what happened . I liked the feel of her against me . I wanted to stay like that . She drew a single sharp breath  --  almost a gasp , but not quite  --  and her head rolled so that her face was toward me . It was pulled all tight ! She looked like a kid too scared to cry . It was as though I had suddenly smacked my head into something hard . She did n't move in my arm . She did n't move my hand from her blouse . But there was no mistaking the look on her face . She was n't enjoying it . She hated it . She had her teeth gritted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me all in a rush . The whole thing did n't mean a damn to her . She 'd just made up her mind to take anything I gave . I realized that what she wanted was me ! She reached her arm up around my neck again and drew herself toward me . I responded without thinking . Still dazed , I took her to me . I guess I felt happy . There was something to her that all the others had never had . She made me feel good , like for once I had everything I needed . I could tell from the motions that the last barrier was down . If I wanted to go on , I was home . It was up to me . But all of a sudden I did n't want to . Even as I held her in my arms , I began to feel sore . For Christ 's sakes , what was I gon na do , become a sucker for atmosphere ? Anything money ca n't buy , I do n't want . Why the hell could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't she act like other girls ? Like Miss Marmelstein , for instance ? Why did she have to look at you and make you feel that you were changing her whole life ? The hell with this , I figured . I was n't that hard up . If I wanted to get laid , I knew where to go without having to take on responsibilities . I loosened my arms around her and stood up . She droppedp167against the tree , shivering . I smacked my pants hard to get the dirt off and reached for her hand . " Come on , " I said roughly . I swung her up into a sitting posture . The hell with this , I said to myself . They could keep the ten thousand dollars . I 'd get the capital for my business some other way . What did I have Tootsie Maltz for ? " Come on , come on , " I said again . I did n't care how tough I sounded . " What do you think we 've got , all night ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train yet . " She stood there , slightly dazed , smoothing her dress , her lips quivering . If she was going to tell me she 'd never done this before , she could save her breath . I knew it better than she did . " For Christ 's sakes , " I said . " Shake a leg , there , will you ? " She followed me without saying a word.  |p168ON  THE way into my private office , as I passed Miss Marmelsteinat the switchboard , I said , " Get me Pulbetkal on the phone . " The bell rang as I hung up my hat and I picked it up and said , " Hello , Pulbetkal ? " " Yes . " " Mr. Babushkin , please . " " Just a moment , please . " He got on the wire and said , " Hello ? " " Hello , Meyer , " I said . " This is Harry Bogen . How 's everything ? " " All right . " " Have a nice week end ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you why I called , Meyer , " I said . " How about you and I and Ast having a little lunch together to-day ? " " Let 's see , " he said slowly . " I do n't know  --  " He should have had those last three words embroidered on his linen as his motto . " I 'll tell you why , Meyer , " I said . " I saw Ast yesterday and he thought it would n't be a bad idea if we sat down around a table and discussed the whole thing once and for all . What do you say ? " " Well , all right , " he said . " Let 's see , now , Meyer , " I said . " What time is convenient for you ? " " Oh , I do n't know , Bogen  --  "  | " Well , then , let 's say two o'clock . That all right with you ? " " I guess so , " he said . " Well , now , look , Meyer , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because I want to tell Ast , too , you know . Is two o'clock okay with you ? Because if it is n't , let 's make it for any time that 's convenient for you . What do you say ? " " All right , " he said . " Two o'clock . " " Fine , " I said . " Two o'clock at the Beaux Arts . Ask the waiter for my table . I 'll reserve one . " " All right , Bogen , " he said . " Two o'clock . " I hung up and looked at my watch . It was a quarter after nine . I picked up the receiver again and said , " Get me Toney Frocks . " A few moments later I was talking to the switchboard operator at the other end . " Is Mr. Ast in yet ? " " No , sir , he 's not in yet . " Just as I thought . " Well , will you take a message for him ? " " Certainly . " " Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll get it right . Do n't worry . " " I 'm not worrying , " I said . " But get it right . Tell Mr. Ast that Mr. Bogen called him . Mr. Harry Bogen . And tell him that the appointment is for to-day at two-fifteen at the Beaux Arts with Babushkin . Got that ? " " Right . " " Read it back to me like a good girl , will you ? " I said . " Mr. Harry Bogen called , " she read . " Appointment isfor to-day at two-fifteen at the Beaux Arts with Mr.  --  who ? " " Babushkin , " I said , and spelled it for her . " Got the whole thing now ? " " Right , " she said.  | " Fine , " I said . " Now if Mr. Ast gets that message right , just as I just gave it to you , I 'll come up there personally one of these days and give you a nice box of candy . " " Do n't kid me , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a dress salesman . " " Stop insulting me , " I said , laughing . " Is that a way to talk to a person you 've never met ? " " I could talk to you differently , Mister , " she said , " but they 'd pull the telephone out on us if I did . " " You tempt me , lady , " I said . " I think I 'll have to come up there one of these days and put you to the test . " " Better send your picture up first , " she said . " And do n't come without that box of candy . " " Okay , " I said . " When you give that message to Mr. Ast , just ask him about me . He 'll give me a good recommenda-tion . " " Well , that 'll be news , " she said . " Any time that guy gives anything away , I 'd like to be there just to watch . " " All right , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'll see if I ca n't arrange that little treat for you . " " Fine , " she said , " that 's a promise . " Just as I hung up , Tootsie walked in . I looked at my watch . Nine-thirty on the dot . I had him trained right . " Well , here I am , on time , " he said proudly , like he 'd just discovered a cure for cancer . " Yeah , " I said , and got up to sit down on the edge of my desk . He hung up his coat and turned to face me . " Well , Harry , what 's on your mind ? " " Nothing special , " I said , waving my hand and smiling at him . " Just things in general , that 's all . " " I mean , what was all the excitement about on Friday ? You told me to be here this morning nine-thirty , no ? " " That 's true , " I said . " I did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kidding stuff again ? You told me Friday I should be here nine-thirty this morning , and I 'm here . Now what 's all the excitement about ? " " Excitement ? " I said . " What excitement ? Why , I 'm as calm and cool as  --  " He shook his head and pulled out his cigarettes . " Oh , all right , go ahead , go ahead , " he said , trying to sound disgusted . " I see already you wo n't be ready to talk until you 've had a chance to be a wise guy for a few minutes . Okay , go ahead , go ahead . I know you by this time , Harry . " That 's what he thought . " Okay , " I laughed and got up to slap his shoulder . " Here , " I said , pushing him into a chair , " sit down . " I took a seat facing him . " All right , " he said . " So now I 'm sitting . " " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Tootsie , how do you like this delivery business of ours ? " For a few seconds he stared at me . Then he said , " Jesus Christ alive ! Did you haul me back here this morning just so 's you could ask me that ? " " Sure , " I said . " Why not ? " " Say , are you crazy or something ? " " No . Why ? " He rubbed his hand over his face and then through his hair and then squeezed his lips together and leaned forward in his chair . " Listen , Harry , " he began . Sorry , but that 's where I draw the line . " You listen to me , Tootsie , " I said . Not tough . Just friendly . Dutch uncley , sort of . " What 's wrong with me asking a question like that ? We 're partners , are n't we ? Ca n't I ask you even how you like the business we 're in torther ? Ca n't we have a little executive conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy or something ? "   He leaned back and threw out his hands . " I do n't know , " he said to the ceiling . " Maybe I 'm the one that 's crazy ? " Where did he get that maybe stuff ? " I 'm not kidding , Tootsie . I just asked you a simple question , that 's all . Ilow do you like the business ? " He hesitated a moment , still looking at me as though he could n't make up his mind whether he was being taken for a ride or not , and said , " It 's okay . I like it . " " That 's all ? " I said . " You just like it ? " " Well , hell , Harry , I mean what can a guy say to  --  ? " I put on a long face . " I 'm glad you like it , Tootsie . No kidding either . I mean that . I 'm really glad you like it . " " What 's the matter ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said ; and then , brightly , " You savingany money out of this , Tootsie ? " He shrugged . " Well , sure , " he said , " I been saving . " " That 's good , " I said . " Remember what I told you when we started . There 's no sense in pissing it all away . I 'm not saying you have to go around being a mizzo or anything like that . But a guy who saves his money is no dope , let me tell you . " " Well , I been saving . I 've saved all right . " " Yeah ? How much ? " " Oh  --  I do n't know . " He waved his hand . " A coupla thousand . You know . " That was just the point . I did n't know . " Do n't you know exactly ? " I said . " For crying out loud , Tootsie , the least a guy can do is keep track of how much money he 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Sure I do . " He dug into his pocket and pulled out a " You wan na sell me your interest in the business ? " he said . " Sure , " I said , turning quickly to face him . " Why not ? You and I started this thing together , did n't we ? It 's yours just as much as it 's mine , is n't it ? Why should I go ahead and sell out to a stranger ? Would that be fair to you ? Why , you can run this whole shooting match by yourself . If you need any help in the office , if you need anybody to help you with the assignments or handling the boys or anything like that , hell , you can hire a guy for thirty or forty bucks a week , and you can keep the whole profits for yourself . You would n't have to go around splitting with anybody . You 'd be your own boss . Just you and nobody else . The whole works would be yours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been in the business . Thirty-seven hundred . Almost four thousand bucks . Remember , Tootsie , up to now we 've been splitting twenty-five and seventy-five , and you 've been on the short end . But like this , from now on , when I 'm gone , you 'll be getting the whole damn thing , one hundred per cent . " And I was n't just batting them out to him , either . He 'd be getting one hundred per cent , all right . The only trouble with that was that in another month or so , with the way the competition would begin to roll in , that one hundred per cent would be less than the twenty-five he was getting now . " Well , gee whiz , Harry , " he began , " I do n't  --  " " Do n't worry about it , Tootsie , " I said , putting my hand on his shoulder . " There 's absolutely no other way out of i t for me . The way I am now , what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 've got to do it quick . And I do n't care what the hell it costs me to do it , either . I 'd rather have my health than anything . Maybe in a year or two , when I come lack , and I 'm all right again  --  maybe  --  then , if you still feel the same way about it , maybe then we 'll be able to getp176together and work something out , maybe we 'll be able to tie up again the way we did . But right now , Tootsie , I 'm just a sick man , that 's all . I ca n't waste any time . I 've got to get out and I 've got to get out in a hurry . There 's nobody I know I 'd rather turn my end of this thing over to than you , Tootsie , and I want you to have it . " He scratched his head . That made the third time . " I know , Harry , " he said , " I guess I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only thing worries me , is whether I got enough money to buy your end . I mean , what the hell , a thing like this  --  " " You just said you had thirty-seven hundred , did n't you ? " " Sure , but what 's thirty-seven hundred dollars for a  --  ? " Well , if he felt that way about it ! " All right , then , " I said , smiling at him . " If it 's really gon na make you feel bad , suppose we make it this way . Thirty-seven hundred in cash , and let 's say another  --  oh , another eight hundred that you can slip me in a week or so , or you can mail me a check , when the collections come in . So that 'll make it an even four thousand five hundred bucks , and everything 'll be one hundred per cent okay right up to the minute . All right ? " " Well , gee , Harry , still  --  " " That 's all right , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just forget it and do n't worry about it . For you , Tootsie , it 's all right . You can have the whole works for the forty-five hundred dollars . " " Well , gee , Harry  --  " " What do you say ? " " Well , if that 's what you want , Harry , then it 's all right with me . You know that . " Well , I 'll admit , I did have a suspicion . " That 's fine , " I said , taking his hand and shaking it.  | " We 'll go down to Golig to-morrow and we 'll have him take care of the whole thing . " " So quick ? " " Well , it 's Monday now , " I said , " And if we clean up the whole thing to-morrow , then I 'll be able to get away by Wednesday . I can do all my packing to-night and to-morrow , and I 'll be all set . " " You certainly must be sick , Harry , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by looking at you . " In a way he was right , too . My stomach was giving a combined imitation of the Chicago fire and the San Franciscoearthquake . " Well , that 's how those things are , " I said . " You never can tell how you stand . " Where have I heard that before ? " So we 'll go down to Golig to-morrow , okay ? " " Okay , " he said , and got up . He put on his hat and coat , but I did n't move . I figured if I remained seated , and did n't do anything , there was less chance of my giving myself away . " I 'll be here all day , and maybe a little late to-night , " I said , " just in case you want me for anything . I want to clean up my desk and write a couple of letters and things like that . " " All right , Harry , " he said . " I 'm going out to see a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little , something about they can get it cheaper from somebody else and all that . " " They 're crazy , " I said quickly . " Just go up and talk to them and if they get tough , tell them to show you some figures . But do n't worry about those little things . " " I 'm not , " he said . The dope . " Okay , then , " I said , " to-morrow at Golig 's . " " Right , " he said and went out.  |p178As  soon as I heard the outer door close I picked up the receiver and said , " Get me Toney Frocks again , will you ? " " Hello , " the girl at the other end said . " Mr. Teddy Ast , please , " I said . " Is he in yet ? " " Yes , he 's in . Who 's this , Mr. Bogen ? " " Yes , " I said . " How 'd you know ? " " Well , for one thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You can stop right there , " I said , " I feel flattered enough . " "  --  And for another thing , " she continued , " the girl at your switchboard just told me who 's calling when I asked her . " " Well , now that the preliminaries are over , " I said , " what are the chances of talking to Mr. Ast ? " " Very poor , " she said . " He 's busy in the showroom with a customer . " " Aah , hell , " I said . " Is that guy ever free ? " " Once in a while , " she said . " But you always call at the wrong time . " " Well , that certainly is lovely , " I said . " Here I have an appointment with him , and I ca n't even get him on the phone to find out if  --  " " But I have a message for you from Mr. Ast , " she said sweetly . " Is that right ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your rush ? Why do n't you wait until  --  ? " " Now do n't be sarcastic , " she said , " and I 'll tell you what he said . " " Okay , shoot . " " Mr. Ast said , " she said , reciting like a kindergarten kid , " that if Mr. Bogen calls him , Mr. Harry Bogen , I should tell Mr. Bogen , Mr. Harry Bogen , that Mr. Ast , Mr. Teddy Ast , told me that he , Mr. Ast , Mr. Teddy Ast , would be onp179time to keep his appointment with Mr. Bogen , Mr. Harry Bogen , at the Beaux Arts to-day at two-fifteen . Is that all right ? " I love them when they get cute . If I had her near me , I 'd 've pushed her face in . " I guess so , " I said , " but I 'm not quite sure yet . I 'll have to decipher it first . " " Well , I 'm sorry , " she said , " but that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I said . " Well , I mean , on the phone . " " Oh , that 's different . " Maybe it was all in my voice , after all . " Well , thanks , " I said , " and if everything turns out all right , I 'll bring up that box of candy one of these days . " " You do n't have to wait till you 're free , " she said . " You can send it up with a boy . " " What 's the matter , " I said , " you think the boy 'll be able to do better than me ? " " I would n't be surprised , " she said , " and do n't get so fresh , " she added and hung up . After a week end with dimwits , it was a pleasure to talk for a few minutes with someone that gave you a chance to sharpen up your shots . I put on my hat and took my coat over my arm and went out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss Marmelstein , " I said , " and then I 've got a luncheon appointment . I 'll probably In. gone most of the afternoon , but I think I 'll be back later . " " All right , Mr. Bogen , " she said . You bet it is , I thought.  |p180I  ENTERED the restaurant five minutes late on purpose , but Babushkin was already there . He was at the small table I 'd reserved way over in the corner , hunched over the menu because he was scared of the waiter that stood a little way off and kept looking at him . Everything he did was so in keeping with the way I 'd figured him out , that it looked like a gag . But he was n't playing dumb . He was n't that good an actor . I came late because I knew he 'd be there ahead of me . He was the type that was always on time for appointments . That was a good sign . When a guy can manage to hit the time of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been devoting quite a bit of time to reminding himself that he should be there , which means that his mind is n't exactly what you 'd call a beehive , which means that he 's at least a couple of notches lower than a genius , which means he was right up my alley . Another thing I 'd decided on was that he was n't exactly a lion tamer , and here a waiter had him buffaloed , just by looking at him . If I had any doubts about him , this clinched it . " Hello , there , Meyer , " I said , shoving out my hand and giving him a healthy shot of the old personality smile , grade A. " Hello , Mr. Bogen , " he said , getting up to take my hand . " Stay right where you are , " I said , pushing him back into his chair and taking one that faced him , with my back to the wall . That 's my Chicago training , you know . Keep thep181whole room in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't help it . They had me tied up on the phone till just a couple of minutes ago . I came down as soon as I could . " " That 's all right , " he said , " I know how those things are . " Maybe I had a genius on my hands after all . He knew how those things were ! " How 's the missus ? " I asked . " She 's all right , thanks . " " One of these days , " I said , " I 'll have to invite her up to my house to try some of my mother 's blintzes . You ought to hear the bawling out my mother gave me for not inviting her up the other night when you were there . She was so sore I thought she was going to hit me with a frying pan or something . They were all right , those blintzes , were n't they ? " " Yeah , " he said . " I guess your wife 'll like them , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week for her ? I mean , there 's norush , but any time you have a free night , just let me know . " " Well , I do n't know  --  " " All right , then , I 'll tell you what I 'll do . I 'll let you know , and then , if it 's not okay , why , we can change it for some other night . " " All right , " he said . " Do n't forget , now , " I said . " I wo n't , " he said . Well , at least that made one of us who would n't . " And the baby ? " I said . " How 's the baby ? " " All right , " he said . " A little cold it had , but my wife she took it to the doctor and he gave her some kind of oil she should rub on , but now it 's all right . " " Only one you got ? " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " just one . "  | " Well , " I said , with a laugh , " just wait till we get going good , then you 'll be able to afford to have another dozen if you want to . " " Yeah , " he said . Well , that was enough of that . No sense in ruining my appetite completely . I picked up the menu and put it down again . " I wonder what 's keeping Mr. Ast ? " I said , looking at my watch . " It 's almost a quarter after two already . " " He 's probably tied up with a customer , I guess , " Babushkinsaid . Sure , either that , or it was because I 'd told him the appointment was for later . But Babushkin did n't have to know that . There were going to be a lot of things that Babushkin would n't have to know about . " You know how it is with salesmen , " he said . He was taking a hell of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they were . " You bet , " I said , laughing . " I 'm practically in the same boat myself . " I picked up the menu again . " I 'll tell you what . There 's no sense in our waiting for Mr. Ast . We do n't know how long he 'll be . And while I do n't know about you , Meyer , I know I 'm nearly starved . Suppose we order , and when he comes , he can catch up . " " All right , " he said . " Waiter , " I called , but I did n't really have to . He was practically sitting on my neck from the minute I 'd drifted in . I took my time about the order , making it sound compl icated , and when I finished the waiter turned to Babushkin . He looked at the menu for a few seconds , rubbing his face a little like he had a toothache . Then he looked up and said , " Uh  --  I 'll  --  I ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every time I met him he showed more qualifications for the job of being my partner . He did n't look very happy , and when the waiter brought the fruit cup and put it down in front of him , he picked up his spoon and went to work on it without a change of expression . I let him fiddle around with the cherry on top , until he got it onto the spoon and carried it to his mouth . Then I said : " Well , what did your wife say about that proposition we were talking about the other night up at my house ? " He swallowed the cherry and began to talk to the plate of fruit in front of him . " Well , she said it was a good idea , Bogen , " he said slowly . " Only one thing she said  --  I hope you do n't think there 's anything personal in this , Bogen  --  she only said a man has to be very careful of the men he goes into business with . I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go to work for somebody , but , well , she said you ought to pick your partner pretty carefully when you go into busi-ness . " So far that looked like his only drawback as a partner  --  his wife . Was I glad I did n't act on that brainstorm I 'd had about meeting her ! " She 's perfectly right , too , " I said as the waiter changed the plates in front of us . " Why do you think I went all over Seventh Avenue with a fine-tooth comb before I decidedyou were the best designer and factory man there was ? I f I wanted to rush this thing , hell , I could have picked up any one of a hundred dopes who know a little something about designing and cutting and things like that . But like your wife said , I knew that when you 're going into business with a man , the thing to do is be very careful and pick him 1 i ke , hell , I do n't know , like you were picking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dipped my spoon into the plate , but I did n't carry it to my mouth . I 'd rather have the soup get cold than Babushkin . " That 's just what Teddy Ast told me the first time we even talked about it , " I said . " I said what we need more than anything else , Teddy , is a corker of a factory man . I do n't care so much about the other things , I said , if any of the other things are n't so okay it is n't so bad . But a factory man , that has to be absolutely the top , I said . And he agreed with me right away . Get Babushkin of Pulbetkal , ' he said to me , just like that , without even batting an eye , that 's what he said . " He nodded slowly . Maybe he was finally beginning to realize himself that he was a good factory man . " So what do you say , Meyer ? " I said , leaning across the table toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , do we tell him we 're in ? " " All right , " he said , " all right . " I did n't have time to let out the sigh of relief that I should have let out . And I did n't waste any time complimentingmyself , either . Because this was nothing . This was easy . The hard part was yet to come . I just leaned back in my chair and let my joints ease up a little . But in a moment they tensed up again . Because as I leaned back I saw two things . The clock on the restaurant wall , and that said twenty-five to three . And Teddy Ast , dressed to kill , bouncingacross the restaurant toward us . There were times when , seeing him as I did just then , my feelings toward Teddy Ast amounted almost to admiration . With all the handicaps of a body shaped like a toothpickand a face that had about as much distinction in it as a spoonful of mashed potatoes , he was still a snappy number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly front and a gray velvet collar , tab shirt with a black knitted tie , peg-top pants , suede shoes , and a brown pork-pie hatP185with a black band and a tricky little feather stuck into it . I took it all in at a glance and filed it away for future reference . " Here comes Mr. Ast now , " Babushkin said . But I did n't have time to be astonished at the fact that he should have noticed something all by himself . I was too busy reminding myself that for the next few minutes I would be talking to Teddy Ast and not to Meyer Babushkin . " Yeah , " I said , " That 's him all right . " Right about  --  face ! " Hello , Bogen , " he said , nodding briskly , and , " Hello , Babushkin . " He slipped out of his coat and handed it to the waiter with his hat . The suit was a pepper-pot tweed , rough and shaggy-looking , but double-breasted . I marked that down on my list , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . You have to put the " there " in . You ca n't say " Hello , Ast . " It sounds dopey . " How 's the boy ? " " Pretty good , " he said , studying the menu . " Ca n't kick . Say , waiter , " he said , tossing the menu down . " Just bring me a tongue on rye and a glass of beer . But the bread has to be thin , remember , and I do n't want any of that lungy stuff on the tongue . Tell him to cut all that stuff away , understand ? " The waiter nodded . They were all doing it . I guess it was an epidemic . " Okay , then , " he said , dismissing him . " Step on it . I 'm in a hurry . " Then he turned to us and rubbed his skinny hands . " Well , gentlemen ? What 's the good word ? " " Pussy , " I said , and grinned . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Right , my friend , " he said , jerking his face into a smile . " You getting much ? " I shrugged my shoulders and ducked my head and gave an imitation of a Seventh Avenue grease ball . " End iff I go around makink complaindts , so it 'll help me maybe ? " He laughed and showed his teeth . They were n't so hot . They were even and strong-looking , but they were yellow and sloped inward , so that his mouth looked like that of an old man , without teeth , sucked in . " Well , " he said , " any time you run short , just call on Uncle Teddy , and I 'll get you fixed up . " He was going to get me fixed up ! " That 's a promise ? " I said . " A promise , " he said . The waiter brought the sandwich and set it before him . He dug in . I lit a cigarette and watched him . Babushkin just looked worried . " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Alaska ? " I asked . He pushed the food into a corner of his mouth , and said , " Not since I stopped wearing diapers , I did n't hear it . " " No , this one is new , " I said . He washed down the lump of food with a swallow of beer . " They 're all new , " he said . A wise guy . Well , that was all right . He was sure of himself . I liked them that way . " I know , " I said . " But this one is new . " " Yeah , " he said . " Like my girl friend . " " See , it 's this way , " I said . " First they cut a hole in the ice . Then they  --  " " Yeah , " he said , taking another bite of the sandwich andp187examining it to see how much damage he 'd done . " Try again , Bogen , " he said . " Well , " I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , " he said , " but they do n't have to be that old . " He swallowed some beer and attacked the sandwich again . " How about the he-virgin and the nurse ? " I said . " Hear that one ? " " Probably , " he said . But when I finished and said , " Get it ? " he squinted his eye and stopped chewing for a second . " No , " he said . That was the wise guy that knew all of them . They were all new ! " Lemme explain , " I said , and did . " Oh , yeah , sure ! " he said . " That 's right . " Yeah , sure , that 's right ! He knew it all the time ! " Not bad , eh ? " I said , laughing . He finished the sandwich and lit a cigarette . " Say , that 's pretty good , you know ? " No , I did n't know . He was telling me . " When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You have to get the break in when you say the second ' cheap . ' Like this : ' Cheap is chea-eap ! ' " " Cheap is cheap , " he said to himself , memorizing the words . " That one 's pretty good , all right . Wait 'll I tell that to a couple of the buyers . They 'll die laughing when  --  say , that reminds me . " He looked from me to Babushkin and then back at me . " I hate to rush out on you like this , gentlemen , but I 've got a couple of important buyers coming in , and , well , you know how those things are  --  " " Sure , " I said , " we know . " What the hell , I figured , Babushkin might have known , too . Maybe I was n't lying when I spoke for both of us.  | " So how do we stand , gentlemen ? " he asked . " We stand okay , " I said . " It all depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're all set . We 've got our money ready , both of us , and we 're all set . Any time you say okay , all we have to do is make an appointment to go down to the lawyer and we 're all set to go . We 're just waiting to hear from you . " " Then you do n't have to wait any longer , " he said , spreading his skinny fingers out like a fan . " I 'm all set any time you are . My money is ready now . " " Then we 're all set ? " I looked at Babushkin , who nodded , and then at Ast , who jerked his head up and down . " Fine . Let 's see . To-day is Monday . Suppose we make it for Wednesday ? Wednesday all right with you ? All right , then . Wednesday at Golig 's office . I do n't know exactly what time , but I 'll call you both up to let you know . Then it 's Wednesday at Golig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shoved his arms into the sleeves of his coat that the waiter was holding for him . I got up , too , and Babushkin followed . " How 's my old friend Mr. Schmul of Toney Frocks ? " I asked . " You know Schmul ? " Ast said , surprised . " Do I know him ? " I laughed . " I 've been trying to forget him for over a year . I worked for the punk . " " You worked for him ? " " Sure . " " When ? " " About a year ago . " " A year ago ? That 's funny . I 've been with him over two years already , and I do n't remember you . " " That 's because you never go into the back , " I said with a laugh . " No salesman ever goes into the back . " " What do you mean , in the back ? "  |p189I  figured I might as well give him a little jolt . It might shake a little of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was n't dealing with a schmoogie . " I was one of his shipping clerks , " I said . He stared at me . It is n't every shipping clerk that can dig up ten thousand bucks with which to go into the dress business . " You mean that ? " " I sure do , " I said . " A year ago ? " " You bet . " I bent down for the check , but I could feel the look of surprise he had trained on me , and I fumbled a little with the tip on purpose to give him a chance to recover . I did n't want him to get sore or anything . I just wanted him to think about it . On the sidewalk , in front of the restaurant , we stopped . " Which way you headed ? " I asked . " This way , " they both said , pointing down . " I 'm going up , " I said . I was n't , but I said it anyway . No anticlimaxes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . I 'll call you both up and give you the exact time . Okay ? " " Okay , " they said , and walked off together . I laughed a little to myself as I saw them go down the block , and I hoped they would n't get themselves run over or killed . They did n't know it , but they were worth their weight in  --  well , no , not even they were that valuable , but they were worth a lot to me . Two men make a dress business . A designer and a salesman . I was neither , but that did n't stop me . I took it easy . I picked and chose . And out of all of Seventh Avenue , I picked them . I hoped they would have brains enough to feel properly honored . I grinned when I thought of what Pulvermacher 's facep190would look like when he found out I 'd taken away his factory man . But when I thought of that son of a bitch Schmul , and what his face would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lost the services of Theodore ( Teddy to his pals and partners ) Ast to me , I laughed out loud . A couple of people looked at me , but I did n't care . Meal or no meal , this called for a drink . I went into Schrafft 's for a soda . When I got out I felt pretty good . I walked down Broadwayslowly , whistling a little and window-shopping . A black and white tie in Gillette 's window looked good to me , so I went in and bought it . On the corner of ThirtyEighthStreet I saw a women 's accessory shop and I remembered that 1 'd promised Mother a purse to go with her new brown suit . I went in and bought her a good large one , the kind she liked . As I turned to leave the shop , a blue bag in a stand on the counter struck my eye . It was made of soft blue suede , with a white leather border and two large white metal stars , one in each corner , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the dress she had worn to Totem Manor over the week-end . For a moment . I could n't think what the bag she had carriedhad looked like . And this one , aside from the color that matched her dress , seemed to have been made for her . Before I knew it , I had put my hand out and touched it , squeezing the soft sides gently . " Did you want to see this purse ? " the salesgirl said , movingdown the counter toward me . " Why , yes , " I said . " Sure , you can wrap it up for me . " It was not until I reached the street and had walked half a block or so that I began to feel sore . It was n't the money . It was just the feeling that I must have been going soft in the head . What the hell was the sense of buying things for a dame when you knew you were n't going to get anythingp191back in exchange ? What was I all of a sudden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off playing around with a kike broad like that , anyway ? Go buy her eight dollar purses ! What the God damn hell for ? Because my own mother had introduced her to me ? The hell with that crap . If I was going around buying gifts , at least I ought to know enough to buy them for people who knew what was expected of them in return . A dame like Miss Marmelstein , for instance . She was n't making any of the members of the Harvard faculty worry about their jobs . But she was smart enough to know that if I gave her a purse it was n't because I all of a sudden thought it would be a good idea for her to have something that would match the color of her eyes . I stopped walking and looked at my watch . Five-thirty . She should have been there yet . She 'd been hanging around till after six for over a week . But it would be just my luck for her to skip out early this one night when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk quickly , and . soon I was almost running . I burst into the office breathlessly , and stopped short . She looked up at me from behind the switchboard in surprise . " Why , Mr , Bogen ! " she said . " What in the world  --  ? " I felt relieved and after I 'd had a second or so to catch my breath I said , " I 'm in a terrible hurry to get some very important letters out , Miss Marmelstein . I hope you do n't mind staying a little later to-night . " " Why , of course not , Mr. Bogen , " she said , smiling quickly . That was a dame for you ! " I 'm not doing anythingspecial to-night , anyway . " It began to look like she did special things very seldom . Well , I 'd see what I could arrange for her . After all , it would n't make any difference after to-night . But she did n't have to know about that . " I 'll tell you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch . " It 'll take me about a half hour or so to get my papers in shape before I 'll be ready to dictate . I 'll tell you what you do . You go down and have a bite , or go out and buy yourself a new brassiere or something . And say you get back here about six-thirty . That 'll give me plenty of time . " She was all smiles . " Okay , " she said , and got up quickly . " By the way , " I said , holding out the package with the blue and white purse in it , " Here 's a little trinket I picked up for you during the day . " She took it quickly and tore the wrapper off . " Oh , Mr. Bogen , how am I ever going to thank you ? " I 'll give you one guess , sister . " That 's all right , " I said . " Just do n't disappoint me . Six-thirty to-night . " " Do n't worry , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't know that . " I 'll be all ready by the time you get back , " I said . " That 'll be good , " she said . Good my eye . This was going to be lots better than just plain good . This was going to be my swan song . I went into my private office and began to clean out my desk and put the things I wanted to take with me aside . When I finished , my watch said twenty after six . Which meant I had ten minutes to think about how Miss Marmelsteinwas going to look on the couch in my private office as she performed her last official act as a salaried employee of the departing president of the Needle Trades Delivery Service , Inc.  |p193THE  building had two entrances . One on Thirty-Eighth Street and one on Broadway . I walked in through the Broadway entrance , slowly , then out the Thirty-Eighth Street side . I did it a few times , maybe five or six . Each time I got the same brisk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , working , coining money . I was glad now I 'd had the fight with Ast . Even though it had meant taking a chance on his getting sore and walking out while I still needed him , I was glad I 'd insisted on this building over the one he had wanted . The hell with what he wanted . The sooner he learned who was boss , the better . I was in the right place . I walked through the lobby once more , the last time , but this time I did n't go out the Thirty-Eighth Street entrance . I went into an elevator . " Twenty-nine , " I said , and the young guy with the tiny nose and the marcelled hair punched the button . I wondered how long it would take him and the rest of the operatorsbefore they would remember my floor . What the hell , I was n't a shipping clerk in the building any more ; I was a tenant . As we stopped at the various floors , I noticed that the doors that faced the elevator had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on them . Before I stepped out of the car onto the twenty-ninth floor , I noticed that our name had not yet been painted on the door facing the elevator . I made a mental note to remind the super about that . It was a lucky thing I made a mental note of it . Otherwise I would have forgotten it . Because the second I stepped into our showroom I saw the carpet . There were a lot of things and people in that showroom . First of all , it was still full of ladders and pails of paint and brushes . Then some of the wrapping paper and excelsior and rope from the furniture was still lying around . And the pictures on the walls were new . They must have arrived since I had left in the morning . And there were three or four workmen moving around , too . But that did n't matter . I noticed the carpet right away . It did n't fit in with the way I had that showroom laid out in my mind . And after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was laying out on furnishings , I felt I 'd earned the right to have everythingjust so . That was why , as soon as I walked in , I could see something was cockeyed . The carpet was supposed to be purple . But the stuff they had standing up in big rolls was the funniest looking purple I ever saw . It was red . None of it was down yet . The workmen were just unrollingsome of it and getting their tools ready . " Hey , beyzon ! " I called sharply from the doorway . They looked up from their bent-down position . " Whatsa matter ? " I came a little further into the room and they stood up straight . " What the hell do you guys think you 're doing ? " They were all wearing overalls , but one of them , a thin one with a cigarette in his mouth , had a regular vest and shirt and tie on underneath . He did all the talking . " Whaddaya mean , what 're we doing ? " " Listen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day . I don'tp195feel so strong . Do n't make me go around repeating things . I said what do you guys think you 're doing ? " " We 're layin ' a carpet , ai n't we ? " " I 'll tell you , " I said . " You just let me ask the questions . " He shrugged and took the cigarette out of his mouth . " Not in my showroom you 're not laying that carpet , " Isaid . " Not here you 're not . " He just looked at me . All right , I 'm handsome . But I 'm not that much of an attraction . " What 's the matter with it ? " he asked finally . " Nothing 's the matter with it . It looks all right to me . Only it 's red , that 's all . " He turned to look at it , then turned back to me . " See ? " I said . " I told you . I 'm a regular whiz at those things . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was red . Just like that . " He dropped his cigarette on the floor and stepped on it . Then he lit another one . " Ah , nuts ! " I said . " I ordered purple carpet . Purple , see ? Not red . Purple . You can just roll that tiniff up and take it away . I ordered purple . " He inhaled deeply without removing the cigarette from his mouth and bent his head a little , squinting his eyes , to see around the smoke that rose straight up from the cigarette . " Mr. Ast saw it , " he said . " He said it was all right . " Now , was n't that nice of him ! " Listen , " I said , " you heard me. 1 ake that junk back and bring purple . And do n't worry so much about Mr. Ast . He made a mistake . He 's funny that way . He 's liable to make those mistakes every so often . You just take that crap back and bring purple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piece they had opened , and then I went into the back.  |p196Babushkin  was sitting on a cutting table , watching the men around him setting up the machines . And Teddy Ast was standing next to him , leaning on the table and talking earnestly to him . I did n't even bother to walk up on them quietly . I was n't even interested in what they were talking about . It was just nice to know that Teddy Ast and I had gone to the same school . But I was n't worried . I was an honor student . I called to them from the entrance to the factory . They turned around and Teddy smiled . " Come on over , Harry , " he said . " Meyer and I were just talking about you . " Surprise ! Surprise ! " What 's up ? " I said , coming over and swinging up onto the cutting table . " Nothing , " he said , which is n't a bad way to begin . " Only we 'll be opening up soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , so Meyer and I were sort of splitting up among the three of us the various duties of , well , of runningthe business . You know what I mean ? " " I sort of get a rough idea , " I said . " But do n't let me stop you , Teddy . You go right ahead . " " Oh , it 's nothing , " he said , waving his skinny hand , " just who 's gon na take care of this and who 's gon na take care of that and all that sort of stuff . You know . " " That is n't a bad idea , " I said . " Did you come to any agreement yet ? I mean , anything definite ? " " Well , " he said , " I 'll tell you . It 's like this . First of all there 's Meyer here . He 's the factory man . Right ? " I nodded . " Then there 's me . I 'm the salesman . Right ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to . This guy was smooth , and no maybes about it . If baloney were religion , he 'd 've been the next Pope.  | " That leaves only you , Harry , see ? So Meyer and I , we both thought the perfect set-up for you was to be a sort of office manager . Sort of superintendent of the whole works . You could run the office , and keep your eye on things in general while I was out selling and Meyer here was in the back in the factory , and sort of , well , you know , sort of superintend the whole works . " I lit a cigarette and blew the smoke up toward the ceiling before I spoke . " I get the idea , Teddy , " I said . " You want me to sort of superintend the whole works . " " That 's right , " he said , shaking his head and looking at Babushkin . " That 's what we sort of figured out , was n't it , Meyer ? " Meyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw . But I did n't mind . In a three-cornered set-up you ca n't afford to have the pair-off two and one . Especially if you 're on the short end . The best way out is for one of the three to be a hammerhead . At least then it 's one against one . And so long as I 'm not outnumbered , I do n't worry . " What do you think of the idea ? " Teddy asked . " It 's great , " I said . " It 's one of the greatest ideas I ever heard of . " Teddy grinned . " There 's only one thing wrong with it . " Teddy stopped grinning . " What 's that ? " he asked . " What am I going to do with the rest of my day ? " I said . He stared at me . " What do you mean , the rest of your day ? " " You do n't think a thing like running an office is going to keep me busy all day , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could go sit in the crapper with a newspaper for a couple of hours every day . But I 'll tell you the truth , it would be a waste of time . My bowels move pretty good without coaxing , so I'm 98in and out in five minutes . And I never read the papers anyway . I just look at the pictures . " " You mean you do n't think that 's gon na keep you busy enough ? " he asked . His face wrinkled into sharp little regular furrows , like a washboard . " That , " I said gently , " is the general idea , Teddy . " " Well , then , what do you want  --  ? " " Look , Teddy , " I said , " there 's a couple of things we might as well get straightened out right now . You and me and Meyer here are partners in a new dress business . But it 's not just an ordinary dress business . I can see from the way you and Meyer were laying things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you 've been thinking this is just an ordinary small dress concern . But that 's where you 're wrong . You do n't think I 'd go to the trouble of getting the best factory man in the business and the best salesman in the business just to start another heel dress concern , do you ? " Who 's a dope ? " You do n't think I 'd sink a young fortuneinto a showroom if I thought we were gon na match for cigar store coupons , do you ? Oh , no , Teddy . Apex Modes , Inc. is gon na be the house on the street . Forget about Schmul and Toney Frocks and those other schwanzos . We 're stepping right into Pulvermacher 's class . And when we learn all they got to teach there , we 're gon na get promoted . We 're going into the big time , Teddy , and we 'll need a lot more than just one salesman . " " All that 's very nice , " he said quickly , before I could continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start , Harry . But just remember . I 've been in this game for a long time . I know it inside out . You ca n't just start a million-dollar dress firm just by talking about it . " " I know that , Teddy , " I said . Get this Teddy and Harry bull . Just a couple of buddies . " I know it . But you justp199watch our smoke . I 've got a couple of tricks up my sleeve that 'll make this market sit up and take notice . You just leave that to me . " He sucked in his cheeks like he was getting ready to whistle , but he did n't . He just looked at the ceiling , and said , " So what about what we were talking about first ? About you being office manager and superintendent and it was n't enough to keep you busy ? " I get it ! Sarcasm ! " Here 's my idea , " I said . " I 'll be office manager and superintendent and all the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . We 're gon na need an extra one before long , and it might as well be me , instead of us hiring somebody . " He laughed a little at that . " That just shows how little you know about the dress business , " he said , putting his hand on my arm to pull the punch a little . " You 're no salesman , Harry . You know that . " " That 's nothing , " I said , laughing back at him . " You ought to hear what my public school teachers used to say about me and how fast I could learn things . So what if I 'm not a salesman , now , so what ? Have n't I got the best salesmanon Seventh Avenue for a partner , Teddy ? Ca n't he teach me ? " The general idea , gentle reader , was that no pyoick with canary teeth and a snowplow nose was going to bury Harry Bogen of the Bronx Bogens in the back some place , while all the souvenirs and nickel-plated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " You 're really funny , Harry , " he said . I must have been . I was positively panicking him . " You ca n't learn to be a salesman overnight . " " So it 'll take me two nights , " I said , hopping off the cut- ting table to end the interview , but not forgetting to grin up at him in friendly fashion . This politeness was beginning to make my jaws ache . " So it 'll take me two days , " I saidagain . " So what ? "  |p201AST  stuck his head into the office from the showroom and scowled a little . " What do you say , Harry ? " he said irritably , shoving out his wrist to look at his watch . He was wearing his hat and coat and he had Stampers Arrival Of Buyers in his hand . " It 's ten to nine already . " I looked at my own watch . " Throw the watch out , Teddy , " I said . " It 's only twenty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , I said , " All right , all right , all right . I 'll be out in a minute , " and turned back to the girl . He went back into the showroom . " All right , then , Miss K , " I said . " I have to go now . I guess I 've explained everything there is , and you know what we want . If there 's anything you do n't understand , anything you want to know , just ask Miss A here , " I pointed to the bookkeeper , " or wait 'll I get back . But I think you got everything down all right . No ? " " Yes , Mr. Bogen , " she said , shaking her head so the glasses shivered on her nose . " One more thing , " I said , turning back . I like to get these things off my chest while they 're hot . " I 'm a pretty easy boss to work for , but there 's one thing I ca n't stand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean to insult you or anything , but I ca n't help it . I 'm funny that way . " I pointed to the glasses pinched up on her nose with the long silver chain stretching down and around her neck . " Every time I see a nice young girl , a girl like you , for instance ,  | Miss K , wearing those kind of glasses , I get good and sore . " She blushed and her hand shot up quickly to the glasses . " If you have to wear glasses , get yourself a pair of simple frames . But for God 's sakes , get rid of those things . All right ? " I said , and smiled reassuringly . I know it 's a little silly , and maybe in a way it was stupid , too , to risk getting her sore , in case she was merchandise , I mean . But I was telling her the truth . I ca n't stand that kind of fake ritz . Every time I see a dame with those things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her profile . " All right ? " I repeated , smiling . " Yes , Mr. Bogen , " she said , and took the glasses off . " Okay , then , " I said , patting her on the head , and then went out into the showroom . Teddy was sitting at one of the little tables , smoking a cigarette and looking through Stara pers . He jumped up as soon as I came in . " Jesus , Harry , " he said , folding up his face like an accordion , " I ca n't sit around all day waiting for you . We got ta get over there . " " Aah , quit bellyaching , will you ? We got a good fifteen minutes yet . " " What the hell takes you so long to get out in the morn-ings ? " " I got ta paste up my stamp album first , " I said . Go tell him what takes me so long to get out in the mornings ! " What do you think , all I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Just in case you forgot , just in case it slipped your mind , Teddy , I also happen to be the office manager around here . Remember ? " He made a funny face . Or rather , he tried to make it funnier . But it was a waste of time . " When do you think I take care of that , when I 'm sleeping ? " He reached for one of the two large sample cases.  | " All right , Harry , all right . But Jesus , every morning . To-day  --  " " To-day I happened to be hiring another girl to help out in the office , " I said . " Do n't you ever do anything else ? " he said . " All the time you 're hiring new girls for the office . Or if it 's not that , then you 're firing them . What was the matter with the girl you hired last week ? " I figured the time was n't ripe yet for us really to square off . Although a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in practice . ' When the time came , I wanted to be in condition to give him his lumps . So I grinned and winked at him . " You know me , Teddy , " I said . " Not that I got any designson them or anything . If I wan na get put I know where to go . I do n't like to mess up my own doorstep . But just the same , hell , while I 'm hiring somebody I might as well make it pleasant around here . I do n't like to have a bunch of dogs floating around . While I 'm at it , I might as well hire something with a well-turned ass and a decently uplifted tit . Am I right or no ? " He shook his head and that accordion face of his folded up again . Only this time it was a smile . It looked the same as before , but it was a smile . After you knew him a while you got so you could tell the difference . " Okay , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Grab hold of that one and let 's go . " I picked it up and put it down again . " Listen , " I said , " I 'm getting good and sick and tired of lugging these lousy things . Why ca n't we get a boy to carry them for us ? What are we , shipping clerks or something ? " He put down his case and looked at me . " That 's a hot one all right , " he said . " You 're the guy that started all those delivery businesses in the neighborhood ,  | you 're the guy that did away with shipping clerks on Seventh Avenue , and now you 're the guy that 's crying ! " He started to laugh and shake his head . " Boy , that 's a hot one on you all right , Harry . That 's a hot one . But I guess it 's just too tough . We got no shipping clerks . We got a deliveryservice . So we have to carry our own sample cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivery service to deliver our packages and our orders , but we have to carry our own samplecases . It 's tough , Harry . Boy , is it tough ! " " It certainly is tough , " I said , laughing with him . " But not on us . Because I got an idea how it wo n't be tough on us any more . Maybe it 'll be tough on somebody else , but it 's not gon na be tough on the president and treasurer of Apex Modes , Inc. any more . " I turned toward the office , and he said quickly , " Hey , where you going ? " " Come on , " I said over my shoulder , " I 'm gon na make it a little less tough for the both of us . " " Holy Christ , Harry , " he said , " it 's late already . We 'll never get there on time , and then it 'll  --  " " We 'll take a cab , " I said . " And anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls looked up when we came into the office . " Take a letter , Miss K , " I said , standing over her . " This goes to the Needle Trades Delivery Service , Inc . Put in that I. N. C. They 're at two-twenty-four West  --  well , I do n't remember it right now , but it 's in the phone book , or wait , you can dig out one of their bills from the file . You 'll get the address there . All right . Needle Trades DeliveryService , Inc. , attention Mr. Maltz . No , leave out that attention business . Just Needle Trades Delivery Service , Inc . Gentlemen . Please be advised that we are discontinuing your service as of the thirty-first of this month . Be good enough to render your final statementp205as of that date , and oblige . All right , Miss K , get that ready and Mr. Ast 'll sign it when he gets back . " Miss A looked up from behind her books . " By the way , Mr. Bogen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Maltz called you again yesterday . He 's been calling you pretty  --  " " Yeah , " I said , " I know . Just do n't pay any attention to him . He probably wants to borrow money or something . Any time he calls , just tell him I 'm out , that 's all . " I turned to the new girl . " You 'll be at the switchboard most of the time , Miss K , so you just remember that too , will you ? If a Mr. Maltz calls , I 'm not in . " " Yes , Mr. Bogen , " she said . " All right , then , " I said . " And remember . Mr. Ast 'll sign that letter when he gets back . " " But why me ? " Teddy said . " Aah , I know this guy Maltz , " I said . " It 'll look better if you sign it . I 'm supposed to be in Europe or some place , anyway . How 's it gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm out , but the next day he gets a letter signed by me ? See what I mean ? " " Yeah , well , all right . But , hell , Harry , how about our deliveries ? " " We 're gon na be old-fashioned , " I said , slapping him on the shoulder . " We 're gon na start a back to the land movementor something like that . We 're gon na hire ourselves a couple of old-fashioned shipping clerks . " " Yeah , but it 's more expensive , is n't it ? " " So what ? I 'd rather pay the few extra dollars a week than tear my arms out schlepping those damn sample cases around . " " Yeah , but  --  " " But nothing , " I said , pushing him toward the sample cases and taking one myself . " I 'll tell you about it some other time . We got less than ten minutes . Come on , Teddy , shake your ankle . We got ta hurry . " The cab got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid the driver and we went into the long arcade , past the classy-looking passenger elevators , toward the ones at thefar end under the sign SALESMEN WITH SAMPLE CASES WILL USE THESE CARS . Only one car was down on the ground floor , and that was too jammed for us to get in , so we set the cases down and waited for another one . A lot of other salesmen kept coming down the arcade toward us and set their sample cases down to wait for a car . I knew most of them by this time , and Teddy probably knew all of them , just as they probably all knew each other , but they did not speak . They just smoked and watched the indicator over the elevator door . They even seemed a little sore at each other . I did n't blame them . I felt a little sore myself , having to lug those heavy sample cases around . Some of them had boys with them to help with the cases , but most of them carried their own . Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank me , and I could thank myself , for having to carry those cases . Pretty soon , though , they 'd be able to thank me for not having to carry them any more . Well , that 's life . To-day you 're on bottom , to-morrow they 're on top . Nuts . I suddenly thought of something . " Say , Teddy , " I said in a low voice , " how is it I never see any of Pulvermacher 's salesmen around here ? This partner of his , this Kalisch , he 's supposed to be such a holy wonder of a salesman , how come I never see him around here ? " " Them , they 're different . " " What do you mean , different ? Do n't they have to sell the same as we do , the same as everybody else does ? "  | " Sure , but they 're so big , they make such high-priced stuff , they do n't have to do this . " " What do you mean , they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buyers here , do n't they ? " He looked disgusted as he watched the hand on the indicatorswing around slowly toward zero . " Yeah , they come . But they do n't bring any sample cases . They come with a couple of models , the models wear one of their hot numbers each , and that 's all . The rest of their stuff , the buyers come to their showroom . They throw a big opening when they show their new line and all the buyers come . But that 's the high-priced stuff . The twenty-nines and over . " " Maybe for the fall line , Teddy , we 'll take a crack at that higher-priced stuff . What do you say ? " " You 're crazy , " he said . " We 're a sixteen-seventy-five house . Come on , " he said suddenly , reaching for a sample case and moving into the elevator . We were jammed together face to face in the crowded car . " What 's so crazy about it ? " I said . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was with Pulvermacherfor years . And we got the showroom , have n't we ? We got as nice a showroom as Pulvermacher has . " " Forget it , " he said . " You 're crazy with the heat . " Phooey ! He had a breath that an exterminator would have paid to bottle . " All right , " I said . " So I 'm crazy with the heat . " The car stopped and the whole mob rushed out . I followedTeddy up to the wooden railing that divided the long room in half and waited while he scribbled blue slips for the buyers he wanted to see . In a few seconds the salesmen were waving wads of these blue slips and yelling at the office boys on the other side of the railing.  | " Whaddaya say , Tony , take this in to Miss LeBeau , will you ? " " Hey , kid . For Miss Smith . Here 's one for Miss Smith . " " Mrs. Hopper 's in , ai n't she ? Take this in like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mob kept moving and shoving and yelling and waving slips . Every once in a while one of the office boys would come over , take a slip and carry it into one of the dozen doors that stretched along the wall of the room that faced us across the railing . In a few seconds he would come out again , return the slip to the salesman , and take another one . The salesman who received the slip back would scan it quickly . If the box that said " Will see " was checked , he grinned and picked up his sample case and went through the gate in the railing , waving his slip at the guard as a pass . If it was the " Will not see " or the " Call again on  --  " box that was checked , he scowled and spit on the floor and said , " The bitch , " and began to yell for one of the office boys again . The yelling and the shoving did n't stop for a minute , and the salesmen grew more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall crept toward ten . All they had was an hour , from nine to ten , and a lot of them wanted to see as many as eight and ten buyers . They fought each other for a place at the rail and swore when they lost an inch , but nobody started punching becausethe minutes were too precious . Every once in a while one of them would try to shove through the door in the railing . But three or four of the office boys would come together in a wedge and force the intruder back . These officeboys were the snottiest little punks you ever saw . They moved their feet like they were stringing pearls , and when they took a slip they acted like they did n't expect you to forget them in your will . I looked at Teddy . He was dividing his time betweenp209swearing , lighting cigarettes , and yelling at the office boys . " Why do n't you slip one of them a buck ? " I said . " Give him a buck and he 'll take it in for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our money , it grows on trees ? " He stepped on his cigarette , lit another one , and turned back to his yelling . " Gim me that , " I said , grabbing the slip out of his hand . Before he could say anything I wrapped a dollar around it , shoved it into an office boy 's hand and said , " Give that to Miss Bonthron of Jessup Jordan . Bonthron of Jessup Jordan . " " Okay , " the kid said and moved across the room . " What the hell do you think we are ? " Teddy said . " Mil-lionaires ? " " Aah , what 's a buck ? " " What do you mean , what 's a buck ? You 're all the time throwing money around like  --  " " Aah , nuts , " I said , " Stop worrying about it . " When the kid came back Teddy took the slip , looked at it quickly , and turned to me . " See ? What 'd I tell you ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box was checked . " All right , " I said , throwing up my hand , " You do this your own way . " I lit a cigarette and sat down on the sample case . Let him keep on veiling his head off if he wanted to . I was n't even listening to him . There was nothing more he could teach me . I had my own ideas of how to sell dresses . This was the last time anybody was going to find me down here tearing my arms and lungs out and begging some baloney to let me come in and see her for a minute . If a midget brain like Pulvermacher did n't have to do it , then I did n't have to do it either . At ten o'clock the gong rang . The salesmen tried to getp210one last slip in , but from the way the office boys quit you 'd think it was a fire alarm . In another couple of minutes the buyers began to come out , dressed for the street , carrying their order books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the salesmen that hung around them like flies . " What do you say , Miss Rhinelander , just give me a minute ? " Sorry , sorry . " You coming up to see our line , Miss Crowley ? We got a couple numbers  --  " Not to-day , sorry . " Aw , Miss T , be a good scout . Lemme just show you  --  " Sorry , sorry . " Just a second , Miss Rhinelander . Ca n't I see you just a second ? " Sorry , sorry . I did n't know exactly what they were sorry about , or for whom . But one thing was sure , they were n't being sorry for me . Because I was just watching them and laughing . When the private elevator closed on them and carried them down , the salesmen went back to their sample cases and the elevators reserved for them . Teddy was quiet until we reached the street . Then when I hailed a cab , he said quickly , " Do n't you ever believe in walking ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Where do you think all this money 's coming from , anyway ? " he said . " Aw , climb in and stop crying so much , " I said , shoving in the sample cases . He went in after me and the cab started . " Did you see any buyers ? " I asked , although I knew the answer . He gave me a dirty look and I grinned back at him . " I do n't see Pulvermacher breaking his ass chasing down to these lousy buying offices with dresses , " I said . He lit a cigarette and whistled when he blew out the smoke.  | " And what 's good enough for Pulvermacher is good enough for me , " I added . " Aah , you 're crazy . " " So I 'm crazy , " I said . " But I still  --  " He turned around to face me . " Listen , Harry , forget all that dopey stuff about making a higher-priced line . Just try to get ready a little earlier in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on cabs . That 's all . Stop worrying about Pulvermacher and his line . Worry a little more about ours . " Well , it 's nice to have a guy around to pick your worries for you . But if I did n't have any greater need for Teddy Ast than that , maybe it would be better if we kissed each other good-bye . " Just answer me one question , " I said . " What the hell are you crying about ? So what if it costs us a couple of bucks in cabs ? So what ? We 're making dough , are n't we ? "  |p212I  WAS signing checks in my private office when I remembered something . I picked up the receiver and said , " Get me Listokens and Tsitsarnes . " Then , " Hello , L. and T. ? " " Yes . " " Mr. Listokens , please . " " Speaking . " " Oh , hello , Listokens . This is Bogen of Apex Modes . " " Yeah , Bogen . " " How 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What silver fox col  --  ? Oh , yeah , yeah . Sure , sure . I got a man working on it now , Bogen . " " Well , you do n't sound so enthusiastic about it . Don'ttell me you forgot all about it . Because if you did , I 'll  --  " " No , no , Bogen . I did n't . It just sort of slipped my mindfor a moment . It 's in work now . " " Well , just do n't forget it . I want that by Monday duringthe day or Tuesday night at the latest , understand ? " " You 'll have it , Bogen , do n't worry . " " I 'm not worrying , " I said . " But if I do n't get it on time , then you better start worrying . Because Apex 'll never buy another inch of fur from you , understand ? " " Just do n't worry about it , Bogen . You 'll get it . " " Okay , " I said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Come in . " Babushkin shoved his worried-looking face around the door.  | " You busy , Harry ? " It was nice of him to knock before he came in . In a dress house with three models it was a good idea . But Babushkin did n't do it because it was a good idea . He did it because he was scared he might see something he 'd heard about , but had never seen . Or maybe he was a gentleman . He had the first requirement . He was dumb enough . " Come on in , Meyer , " I said , " what 's on your mind ? " He stood in the middle of the room and rubbed his nose . " Nothing special , Harry , " he said . " I just thought maybe , you know , if you were n't busy  --  " " Sit down , " I said , waving toward the couch , " take a load off your feet . " " Thanks , " he said , taking the chair that faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll sit here . " " What do you know ? " I said , lighting a cigarette and leaning back in my chair . He shifted around in the chair and rubbed his nose a little harder . Well , the wear and tear would never hurt it . He had the kind that was built to last . " Well , I 'll tell you , Harry , " he said slowly . " It 's nothing special , you know  --  " Maybe I did , at that . But I just sat back innocently and blew smoke at him . It was his move . " Teddy told me to come in and speak to you , " he said suddenly . Poor Teddy . It must be tough to be so tongue-tied that you have to pick a spokesman like Meyer Babushkin . Or maybe guys like Teddy were only tongue-tied when they had to speak to guys like me . " What 's the matter with Teddy ? " I asked innocently . " He seemed all right when I saw him less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , Harry . He told me to  --  Well , he told me to come in and talk to you . " Now I was beginning to get it . I did n't understand at first . Teddy had told him to come in and talk to me ! See ? " What about ? " I said , leaning over to drop my ashescarefully into the huge jade ash tray on my desk . Babushkin stopped rubbing his nose and began to pickit , scowling at the floor as he worked . " Use your thumb , Meyer , " I said . " You 'll get more . " " What ? " he said , looking up suddenly . " Nothing . " " Yeah , Harry , he told me to come in and see you . " " Well , here I am , " I said , spreading my arms wide . " Take a good look at me . " " He said I should come in and talk to you , " he said again . " What about ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might as well be calm about it . He took a deep breath and swallowed hard . " About the money we 're spending , " he said quickly . " He said you 're spending too much money . " " He did ? " I said , throwing my eyebrows up to the ceiling . " Teddy said that ? " " Yeah . He said I should come in and talk to you . He said he spoke to you already a few times , but it did n't do any good . He said I should come in and talk to you . " I knew I was on the right track . Teddy had told him to come in and talk to me ! " Well , Meyer , " I said , " I 'm sure Teddy would n't say a thing like that if he could n't back it up , would he ? He must 've been more specific , was n't he , Meyer ? " " Yeah , well , yeah , he was . " " That 's fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette . I do an awful lot of leaning back and lighting ofp215cigarettes . " Let 's hear what he had to say . Where am I spending too much money ? Be specific . Where am I throwingmoney around like water ? He said that , did n't he ? That I was throwing money around like water ? Or maybe he said I was spending it like a drunken sailor ? Which ? But let it go . Let 's skip that . Just tell me where he said I was spending too much money . " I was handling him delicately . No loud-mouthed denials or objections . With morons like Meyer Babushkin you alwaystake it easy , draw them out , reason with them , try to make what you say sound logical . The mailed fist in the velvet glove . " Well , he said you were , well , you were spending too much money . " " Maybe you better turn that record over , Meyer , " I said . " What ? " " I said in what ways did Teddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money ? " Fooled him that time . I did n't lean back nor did I light a fresh cigarette . I still had the one I lit before . " We-ell , he said you were spending too much on presents for buyers . " " Aw , come now , Meyer . You do n't believe that , do you ? " " Well , he showed me bills . He showed me bills from that French place , I do n't know the name , you know the one I mean , he showed me the bills for the boxes of candy and honest , Harry , gee whiz , that 's a lot of money for candy . Honest , Harry , it 's a lot . " " But that 's nothing new in the dress business , is it , Meyer ? Why , even Teddy himself sends presents to the buyers . You have to . They expect it . " " Yeah , but he sends them flowers and little things like that . Flowers do n't cost so much . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said earnestly ,  | leaning across the desk to make it sound convincing . " Flowerscost less , but you do n't get anything for your money . Flowers die . And then what 've the buyers got ? Nothing . And when the flowers are dead , they do n't remember you . You send them something substantial , like a box of candy , something practical , something they can at least eat , and they appreciate it . At least it lasts longer . And the longer it lasts , the longer they remember you . See what I mean ? " " Yeah , well , I know , Harry . But he said other things , too . " " Yeah , what ? Tell me what ? " He scratched his head . I debated with myself whether I should warn him against splinters , but I decided against it . After all , it was his head . " We-ell , " he said , " the pocketbooks , the theatre tickets , the  --  oh , you know , Harry , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said , leaning back and waving my hand . " That 's only more of the same thing . I 'm telling you , Meyer , this business of sending flowers and things like that is the bull . Just because that 's what most every salesman in the business does , does n't mean it 's the best , does it ? I mean , I leave it to you as an intelligent person , Meyer . " That was one hell of a place to leave it . " You 've got to do these things right or do n't do them at all . All the money spent on things like flowers is just so much money wasted . These buyers are n't any of these dainty dames , you know . For these horsefacedpots , you should excuse the expression , Meyer , for these tough broads , flowers is like  --  like  --  I do n't know , like sending a machine-gun to a baby . You have to give them something practical , something they can use . Then they remember you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I mean ? " He nodded and squirmed around in his seat and sucked his lower lip . I tell you , he had a regular bag of tricks.  | " Well , it 's not that so much , either , Harry . It 's  --  it 's  --  " " It 's what , Meyer ? " " It 's this business of , well , you know , this charge account you got with that , you know what Teddy calls it , the call joint . The charge account you got there . That costs a fortune , does n't it ? " What the hell was he blushing about ? Did n't he know the facts of life ? He was married , but with guys like him that did n't mean a thing . " Oh , well , " I said , smiling at him . " That 's just a little of my own ideas . " " Yeah , but the way Teddy says , it costs a lot of money , does n't it ? " " So what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked one out , and wagged it in front of his nose . " Here 's an order we got this morning from Bentcher of Finck and Swathmore . How do we come to sell Finck and Swathmore ? Bentcher 's had his steady houses for years , has n't he , and a new firm never even had a smell in for an order from him . So how come all of a sudden he throws business like this to Apex Modes ? " I slapped the order a few times . " Because our line is hot , which it is ? Or because Teddy Ast , our star salesman , wears Pat Caruso clothes ? Oh , no , Meyer . We got this order because last night I got Mr. Bentcher of Finck and Swathmore fixed up with one of the neatest numbers in that call joint of mine . That 's why we got an order from Finck and Swathmore , and as long as we got our account with that call joint , you can bet your boots Bentcher will be buying from us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and patted his hand . " Do n't worry , Meyer . I know what I 'm doing . Maybe I have n't been in the dress business as long as you or Teddy . But I know a couple of things about selling . With men buy- ers , you get them put and you can sell them the Brooklyn Bridge . And with woman buyers  --  " I rolled my eyes like Groucho Marx and lit a cigarette  --  " With women buyers , Meyer , I do all the yentzing . At least there you ca n't say it 's too expensive . That 's one thing about me , Meyer , I never yet sent a buyer a bill for slipping her the business . " I figured he was through , but I always like to do these things right . I like to add the parsley to the fish and the paper ruffles to the drumstick . " Is there anything else Teddy told you to tell me was too expensive ? " I asked gently . He was so flustered he could hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ought to take him out and get him laid ? But no , I wanted him to keep his mind in the factory . " Anything else , Meyer ? " I asked again . " Well , he , Teddy , he said something about the , about the models . He said  --  " " Yeah ? What about the models ? " " He said all the other houses they pay fifteen a week for models , and we , we pay thirty . Thirty dollars , Harry , you know , that 's a lot of money for a model . " " Oh , I do n't know , " I said . " It all depends how you look at those things and what you expect from them . There are models and models , you know , Meyer . Me , I like the kind that if you put it up to them , they do n't drop dead from the shock . You know what I mean , Meyer ? And that kind you do n't get for fifteen bucks a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just working a couple of nights a week . See what I mean , Meyer ? " Meyer saw all right , but he did n't say so . He was still too flustered to pick his words right . " There 's another thing yet , too , Harry , " he said finally , examining the grain of the desk . Well , it would stand in- 219 spection . The furnishings of that little private office costplenty . " Yeah , what ? " " The new line . Teddy says you 're  --  I mean , he said you were a little , well , you know , maybe a little foolish about going into that expensive stuff . He said we 're a lower-priced house , and to go into that expensive stuff is  --  . " " Listen , Meyer , " I said confidentially , " you want me to tell you a little secret ? " He just looked at me . " This is between me and you , Meyer , " I said , leaning toward him and smiling . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just between me and you , Meyer , " I said , " I think Teddy Ast is a big schvantz . " His eyes blinked a little . " That 's just between the two of us , " I said , then more briskly , " I do n't know what he 's hollering about . We 're each of us , all three of us , we 're making more money than we ever made before . Is n't that so ? " He nodded . " And besidesthat , we 've each got a cut-in on the profits . So what the hell is he hollering about , will you tell me ? " He did n't answer . I got up and walked over to his chair and put my arm on his shoulder . " You just listen to me , Meyer , " I said , " and we 'll be all right . You just take care of the styling and see that the contractorsdo n't walk away with the place . Leave the rest to me . You 're making more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boss . So stop hollering and stop listening to Teddy Ast and his squawking . Just get going on that fall line , and if Teddy shoots off his mouth , just send him to me . By the way , how is the line coming along ? " For once his face took on a little life . " It 's great , Harry , " he said . " Just wait till you see it . "  | " That 's fine , " I said , patting his shoulder to end the interview , or monologue , or whatever you want to call it . He hesitated a moment , and the smile on his face faded into a worried frown . Or rather , excuse me , he began to look normal again . " There 's only one thing , Harry , " he said . " Yeah , what ? " " We 're a , well , you know , we 're a lower-priced house , " he said . " How 're we gon na get the buyers , the market , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know we 're switching to the higher  --  ? " " My dear Meyer , " I said , grinning at him . I 'd better watch out . Here I was in the dress business only a couple of months and already I was beginning to talk like Phil the Fag . " Do n't you bother that cute little head of yours about that . " " Yeah , Harry , but how  --  ? " " Just leave that to me , " I said , patting myself on the chest . " The scheme I got for presenting our new line , Meyer , is gon na knock Seventh Avenue 's eye out . " " But what  --  ? " " You just wait and see , " I said , holding the door open for him.  |p221I  WOULD have liked to keep the box behind my back until I came in the door , to make it a surprise . But the package was too large . And besides , as soon as I turned into HoneywellAvenue I could see her leaning out the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street for me . Her face lit up as soon as she saw me , and then , when she saw the box I was carrying , she pinched up her lips and began to shake her head disapprovingly . I waved to her and quickened my pace . She opened the door for me and said , " Well , what kind of crazy presents have you been spending your money on now ? " I looked blank . " Presents ? " I said . " What presents ? " " Never mind , never mind , " she said , pointing to the box in my hands . " What are you got in there ? " " Oh , this ! " I said , carelessly . " Oh , this is nothing . This is just some cheese I brought home so you should be able to make me some blintzes , that 's all . " " Again with the blintzes ! " she cried , striking her forehead with her hand . " Do n't you ever think of anything else besides those blintzes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " What else is there to think about ? " I said . She made a threatening gesture , playfully . " Go ' way , " she said . " So let 's see already what kind of cheese you brought , it should be so big that it has to be packed in a box big like an elephant . " " First let 's get out of the doorway , " I said . " All I need is to get a draft on me and I should catch a cold , and then I 'll be all set good for to-morrow . " " So come on . " She led the way to the kitchen , quickly , and I put the box on the porcelain-topped table . " Go ahead , " I said . " Open it . " She opened the box and stopped for a moment with her mouth open , staring at the rich-looking mound of black fur , with the sprinkling of grayish-white hairs shot through it , surrounded by the bed of crumpled tissue paper . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arms around me and kiss me . " Go ahead , Ma , " I said , patting her shoulder and smiling , " try it on . " She dried her hands quickly and picked up the fur piece out of the box . She stroked it gently for a moment , smiling happily , and then put it across her shoulders . She buried her cheek in the soft thick end that hung down her arm and said , " This is wonderful , Heshie . " " I 'm glad you like it , Ma , " I said . " Next time I 'll get you a whole coat made of the same thing . How 'll that be ? " " Heshie ! " she said severely . " Do n't talk like a baby . You should n't even 've spent so much money on this . " " Why not ? " " Because , " she said , " first of all I have plenty things . And second , you should put your money better in the bank . And anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden , from a clear sky , in the middle of the week , you should go around buying fur collars ? " " Do n't worry so much about my bank account , Ma , " I said . " And anyway , I get it wholesale . "  | " Who 's worrying about your bank account , who ? " she said indignantly . " All right , all right , " I said , stroking her shoulder withthe fur piece on it , " so you 're not worrying about it . " " I only mean , " she said , " I hate you should throw aroundmoney like it was water . " " You talk just like one of my partners , " I said . " Then thank God you got at least one of them he should be a little smart , " she said . We both laughed . " No , I 'll tell you , Ma , " I said . " The real reason why I got you this thing is because to-morrow we  --  the firm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dresses , you know . We 're going after the real money , now , and this is sort of , well , sort of a celebration . See what I mean , Ma ? After all , who then am I going to spend my money on , if not on you ? " She smiled and pinched my cheek . " Mama 's boy , hah ? " she said . " Sure , why not ? " I said . " And then , " I added , " there 's still another reason why I bought it for you . You know why ? " " Why ? " " The other things I got you , well , maybe they just made Mrs. Heimowitz eat her heart out . But this , " I said , " when you walk down the street wearing dais  --  I figure she 'll just about drop dead . " " Do n't talk like that , " she said , but the smile on her face said she was pleased . I took off my coat and began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's over , Ma , " I said , " how 's chances of getting something to eat ? " " All right , " she said , putting the collar back into the box carefully , " but no blintzes. "  | " Why not ? " " You think I 'm a dope ? " she said . " I should make them for you every time you want them  --  three times a day , seven days a week , yet  --  and it 'll come a time you 'll be so tired of them , you wo n't even want to look at them . And then , when that time comes , how do you think I 'll get all those fancy presents , hah ? " I laughed . " You 're pretty good , Ma , you are , " I said . " But do n't worry . Blintzes or no blintzes , you know I would n't stop buying you things , Ma . " " Sure I know , " she said , smiling . " But why should I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner , Ma , " I said , " I think I 'll take you . " " Do n't do me any favors , " she said , shaking her head wisely . " To be your partner , Heshalle , I think a person needs an iron heart . " " Now , that certainly is a nice way to talk about your own son , is n't it ? " " Never mind , " she said , waving her hand at me . " Whether it 's nice or not , I do n't care . But it 's true just the same , no ? " I shrugged . But I was pleased . The old girl knew her onions , all right . " Maybe , " I said . " But that 's the way you have to be in business . If you have n't got the iron heart , it 's the next guy . And that means the next guy 'll be building up the bank balance . What the hell , Ma , that 's the way things are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I suppose you 're right , " she said . " But I do n't know , Heshie . I do n't know if it 's such a  --  well , such a good thing . " " Why not ? "  | " It does to a person something , Heshie . It makes him  --  I do n't know . It changes him . " I waved my hand at her . " Aah , do n't be a baby , Ma . What 's the matter , do I look changed to you ? Sure I 'm changed . Now , instead of bringingyou fifteen dollars a week we should try to pay the rent and the butcher and the grocer and the laundry , so now , now I 'm bringing you silver fox collars . If you call that beingchanged , so all right , so I 'm changed . " She sighed and picked up the box . " Well , maybe I 'm wrong , " she said . " Wait here , I 'll just put this away in the bedroom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Sure you 're wrong , Ma , " I said , stroking her cheek . " Just do n't worry about your little Heshie . He knows how to take care of himself . And he knows how to take care of his mother , too , do n't worry . " " Sure , do n't worry , " she said , and left the room , shaking her head a little . Well , I guess it all evened out in the end . I had to worry about business , and she had to worry about me . I went into the bathroom to wash . When I came out the kitchen table was set for supper . I picked up my spoon and began to eat my soup . Mother turned down the flame on the gas range , poured a plate of soup for herself , and sat down across the table from me . We ate in silence for a few minutes . " Well , what 's the matter , Ma ? " I said finally . " I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She looked surprised . " Why , I said something maybe ? " " You do n't have to say anything , " I said . " I can tell by the way you 're looking at me , that 's all . " 226 I can get it " Heshie , do me a favor , " she said . " Do n't think all the time you 're smarter than the whole world . " " All right . So I 'm not smarter than the whole world . But what 's on your mind ? " She shrugged . " Well , if you ask me , so I 'll tell you . " " That 's what I 'm waiting for . " " What 's the matter between you and Ruthie Rivkin ? " she asked quietly . Boy , some day I 'd really learn to keep my trap shut . " Nothing , " I said carelessly . Why the hell had n't I croaked that dame when I had her in the woods ? " There 's nothing the matter between us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway ? " " Never mind , " she said , " I know . " " Well , if you 're so smart , " I said , " then maybe you know what 's the matter . So what 's the idea asking me ? " " I went to see Mrs. Rivkin yesterday , " she said . " And  --  " " Why do n't you hire a squad of private detectives ? " I said . " Maybe you ca n't keep tabs on everything I do . I mean , after all , Ma , you 're only one person , you know . A couple of dicks helping you out would bring in more informationfor you than you could get by yourself . Just tell me , and I 'll write you a check to cover it , so you wo n't have to take it out of the house money  --  " " Heshie ! " she said sharply . " All right , Ma , all right , " I said . " Forget it . I 'm sorry . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you meant anything or not , " she said , glaring at me . " I do n't care if you 're making a lot of money or not . By me you 're still the same smart one you were when you were going to school . By your dopes , those partnersof yours , you can talk . But do n't come by me here with the nose in the air . "  | " Okay , Ma . Okay . " I reached my plate toward her . " How about s'me more soup ? " She filled my plate and set it before me . As she straightenedup to return to her chair , she gave my head a push . " All of a sudden , my smart one ! " she said . I grinned embarrassedly and began to dip up the soup . " I went to see Mrs. Rivkin yesterday , " she said again . " Do n't make the trip too often , " I muttered . " You 'll get corns . " " What ? " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something maybe ? " " No , " I said . " Well , if you wan na talk , so talk a person should be able to hear you . Do n't talk in your nose . " " You talk , " I said , lifting my spoon high . " I 'll eat . " Me and Tootsie Maltz . " Tokke that way it 'll be better , " she said . " So you hear , I went to see Mrs. Rivkin yesterday . I asked her about Ruthie , I asked her about the grocery , I asked her  --  " " About me , " I said . " And why not ? " she demanded . " I do n't know , " I said , motioning with the spoon again . " I 'm eating . You talk . " " If you 'll only keep that big mouth of yours  --  it goes all the time like on wheels  --  if you 'll only keep that closed for a few minutes , so maybe I 'll be able to talk a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " If you keep a little quiet , " she said , " so I 'll do better . " " Go ahead , " I said . " Try . " She grinned a little in spite of herself . " So I asked about you , too . She said you and Ruthie , you went out a couple times together , you even took her up to the mountains for one day on a Sunday  --  you did n't tell me nothing about that  --  "  | " Do I have to tell you everything ? " She shrugged . " It 's easier , " she said . " But if you do n't tell me , so I 'll find out anyway . " Now I grinned in spite of myself . " You 're telling me ! " " And that , Mrs. Rivkin said , was the last . Since that day , she said it must be a few weeks ago already , since that day , you did n't call her up , you did n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter ? A person could think yet God alone knows what happened . " " Nothing 's the matter , " I said . Go tell your own mother you tried to lay a broad , but you could n't do it because she looked like your mother . " So if nothing 's the matter , " she said calmly , " so why do n't you go up there to see her any more ? " " Because I 'm too busy , " I said . " Is that so ? What are you doing all of a sudden , saving the whole world ? Even the president , he takes off a night or two in the week he should take out his girl  --  " " The president is married , Ma . And he 's got about four sons  --  " " Shut up ! " she said . " So he takes a night or two during the week and he takes his wife to the movies . " " For the president , Ma , they bring the movies to him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If you do n't hold a little that long tongue of yours , andlet me speak , I 'll give you a smack over the head , you 'll haveto go picking your teeth all over the house . You hear me ? " I leaned back in my chair and roared . " Say when , Ma , " I said . She choked back a smile and folded her arms on the table elaborately.  | I 'm asking you once more , " she said . " Why you did n't go up to see her any more ? " " Aah , hell , Ma , what did I do , sign a contract that I have to go up to take out Ruthie Rivkin every night in the week ? " " Must n't be every night , " she said coolly . " Yeah , and it must n't be any night , either , " I said . " If I do n't want to . " " So why do n't you want to , why ? " " Listen , Ma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around here a couple of weeks ago  --  " " In this house do n't call nice girls a dame ! ' " " All right , all right , all right . So she 's a nice girl . " That was the trouble with her . " So you brought this nice girl Ruthie around here , and you said you wanted me to take her out . So I said all right , for you I 'd do it . And I did . I took her out a couple of times , I spent my good money on her , and that 's all . " " Maybe by you that 's all , " she said . " But not by me . " " No ? " " No . " " Well , I do n't care what you say , Ma . You ca n't force me to go out with a girl if I do n't want to , and that 's all . " " It 's not all , Heshie , ' ' she said . She began to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm trying to force you into something , Heshie . I 'm an old woman . Maybe I do n't see things the same way a young boy like you does . And so long you stay honest , you do n't become a crook or a murderer or anything like that , so long you can do what you want . I wo n't say a word . " " Well , you keep quiet pretty loud , " I said . " Because this is different , " she said . " How is this different ? Because I do n't want to take out Ruthie Rivkin , that means I 'm a crook or a murderer ? "  | " No , dope ! " " Do n't call me dope . " " Hold your tongue , " she said .

What are you running away from ? " Look what I had to get myself into ! " I do n't know where you got all those ideas from , Ma , " I said . " It seems to me I ought to know myself whether I like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . " " That 's right , " she said . " You should know . And you do . So why do you say you do n't ? " " If this is n't the craziest thing yet , Ma , " I said . " How do you know I like her ? How can you  --  ? " " Do n't worry , " she said , looking me in the eye . " I know . I could tell from that first night she was here . It 's true , is n't it ? " I dropped my eyes from hers and began to play with the spoon . " Stop bending my spoons , " she said , and I put it down . " It 's true , is n't it ? " she said . I did n't say anything . " It 's true , is n't it ? " she repeated . " No , " I said , without looking at her . " Well , we 'll soon see , " she said . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in the back there of that pudding of a head of yours . But I know you like her and I know she 's a fine girl . Before one of those big tramps of yours gets you , I 'd rather a fine girl like Ruthie should get you . And if you 're too much of a dope to know when you 're well off , so I 'll just have to see to it myself . " " Yeah ? " I said sullenly . " Yeah , " she said . " When you finish eating you just pick yourself up and go into the living room . It 's now , "  --  shep232looked at the clock on the ice box  --  " it 's now a little beforeeight . I told her she should be here by half-past eight , maybe a few minutes earlier . " For a moment I just looked at her . Then I stood up and smacked the table with my fist . " That 's what you think , " I yelled . " What the hell do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I am , a baby ? You ca n't pull any of that fancy stuff around here , Ma . If I do n't want to see her , I wo n't . And nothing you can say or do can make me . Understand ? Where the hell do you get that  --  ? " " What 's the matter , Heshie ? " she said quietly , looking up at me from the other side of the table . " What are you afraid of ? " She had the word all right . " Who 's afraid ? " I said . " You are , " she said . It looked like I was the answer to everything . " Do n't make me laugh , " I said . " Afraid ! " But I sat down again . " Now look , Heshie , " she said , leaning forward . " Maybe I 'm wrong . I do n't think so . I think I 'm right , Heshie . I think you like her and I know she likes you and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't find again if you spend the whole rest of your life looking . But anyway , maybe I 'm wrong . Let 's say for a minute , I 'm wrong . Let 's say you do n't like her . But why , Heshie ? Why ? Tell me , tell your mother , why ? Give me one good reason . " " Aah , Ma , " I said , " you ca n't give reasons about things like that . You either like a person or you do n't . ' That 's all . " " Maybe , " she said . " But then you 're not so positive . But you , you 're so positive you do n't like her , you must at least have one reason . At least one reason let me hear ! " " Aah , Ma , " I began , squirming a little , and then I blurted , " she 's so damn Jewish-looking ! You take one lookp233at her , you see right away she 's a kike from the Bronx . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , walk down the street and have everybody giving me the horse laugh be-cause  --  ? " She flared up so suddenly that for a moment I almost could n't catch my breath . " You crazy dumbbell without shame ! " she cried . " So that 's what 's eating you ! You 're a Jew yourself , are n't you ? Have n't you got a little feeling in you ? What are you , ashamed of what you are ? What are you going to do , go around hiding from people what you are ? Do n't think you 're so smart , Heshie . The world is smarter , " she almost screamed . " They only have to look at you to know . You can try all you want , you stupid dope , you , but it wo n't help . I 'm glad for once that your father is dead . He should n't have lived to hear a son of his talk like that , I 'm glad . " Her voice shifted to a sarcastic note . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! She 's too Jewish-looking for you , hah ? And maybe I look like a shickseh to you ? Well , let me tell you something , Mr. Dope . That girl is got more fineness in her one little finger than all the rest of those tramps you 're all the time running around with . She 's got more  --  " " I did n't say she did n't h " " c , " I yelled . " Hold your tongue , my fine one , " she cried . " Who do you think you 're yelling at , those dopes that you got for part-ners ? " " Keep them out of this , " I cried , and was surprised for a second to find myself in a position where I was defending those two klucks . " I only said I did n't  --  " " Never mind what you said , " she shouted . " I heard what you said . You said enough for one day . " Suddenly she dropped into her seat and was silent . I sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table to take her hand , but she snatched it away . She sat there , staring at her hands . Finally she said , " Why do you bother coming home altogether , Heshie , if we 're going to fight like this ? " " I do n't want to fight with you , Ma , " I said . " I do n't want to stay away from home , Ma . " " If this is what happens when you come home , " she said dully , " maybe it would be better  --  " " Do n't say that , Ma , " I said , reaching across for her hand . She let me take it . " I 'm sorry if I said anything , Ma . I did n't really mean it . " " That you 're sorry , I can believe , " she said quietly . " But do n't say you did n't mean it , Heshie . " She shook her head . " When a person says what you said , it 's only because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heshie . " " I guess it is , Ma , " I said , scowling . " But I ca n't help feelingthe way I do , can I ? " " No , " she said . " But me  --  I do n't feel like that . " " But do n't ever say you do n't want me to come home , " I said . " I like to come home here . I have to come home , Ma . " " What for ? We should fight ? You should say things you do n't want to say ? We should holler at each other like two crazy ones ? That 's what you like to come home for ? " " No , " I said . " And that is n't exactly fair , either , Ma . This is the first time we ever even raised our voices to each other , is n't it ? " " That's. all those things need , " she said slowly . " A be-ginning . " " That 's not true , Ma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want you to say those things . It means too much to me to come home here for you to say those things : ' " When a person begins to think and talk the way you do , Heshie , home does n't mean anything to him any more , " she said.  | " Yes , it does , Ma , " I said . " No , " she said . " You 're a businessman now . You 're a big businessman . You do n't think any more the way a son should think . You think the way a businessman thinks . What 's a home to a businessman ? " " I do n't care about what it means to businessmen , Ma , " I said . " All I care about is what it means to me . For crying out loud , Ma , this is the only place where I can sit down and take a rest without feeling that somebody is going to jump on me from behind , This is the only place where it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ma ? You think I enjoy all this fighting , fighting , fighting all the time , trying to show people you 're smarter than they are ? All right , maybe I do enjoy it . I do n't know for sure . Maybe I think I enjoy it because I know it 's the only way to get any place in this world , it 's the only way to make money and buy the things you want and really live like a person , not a dog . But whether I enjoy it or not , that 's not the point . The point is you ca n't stand a thing like that forever . You have to have a place where you can sit down and take a deep breath and know you 're with a friend , you 're with a person that really cares for you . That 's what coming home here at night means to me , Ma . It makes me feel like a human beingfor a change . I can sit back and stick my legs under the table and eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put one over on me or not . Aah , hell , Ma , " I said , " do n't you see what I mean ? " " Sure I see what you mean , " she said , nodding . " You think you 're saying something new ? Maybe I never said it in the words the same like you use , maybe I never even thought of it that way . I suppose maybe I did n't . But I know that . You are n't telling me something I never heard . What do you think I want you should go with a nice girl like Ruthie Rivkin ? Because she 'll be able to wear the diamond rings and the fur coats you 'll be able to buy for her ? Of course not . Because a wife is to a man what you just said . How long do you think I 'll be here for you to come and sit and eat blintzes and talk ? I 'm not a chicken , Heshie . I 'm an old woman already . Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What 's true is true . I 'm getting older , Heshie . What are you gon na do when I 'm not here ? You 've got to have a wife . You 've got to have the right kind of a wife . I do n't say you must marry Ruthie Rivkin . Maybe you know another nice girl , a girl you did n't tell me about yet . If you have , so all right . But that 's the only reason I talk all the time about Ruthie Rivkin . Because about her I 'm sure . A mother can tell those things , Heshie . A young boy , sometimeshe ca n't . " The hell he ca n't . " All right , Ma , " I said . " Let 's forget the whole thing . Let 's not fight or argue . " " When are you giving the party in the showroom for the buyers ? " she asked . " To-morrow ? " I nodded . " So why do n't you invite Ruthie she should come down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can  --  " " I do n't think she can make it , Ma , " I said . " You know she works during the day , and this is for the afternoon . " " Do n't worry , " she said . " For a thing like this she can get off a half a day . You just tell her she should ask her boss , that 's all . " " Nab , Ma , " I said , " she would n't enjoy it . These people are , well , they 're tough , Ma . They 're hard drinkers and things like that , Ma . A nice girl like Ruthie , she would n't enjoy herself at all . " She dropped her eyes from my face and withdrew her hand from mine . " It 's up to you , Heshie , " she said quietly.  |p237That  was the trouble with hanging around with guys like Babushkin and Ast . I 'd been softened by poor competition . " But I 'll tell you what I 'll do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When she gets here to-night  --  " I looked at the clock  --  " she 's due here any minute , now , I guess . When she gets here , I 'll take her out and show her a good time . All right ? For you , Ma , for you I 'll do it . " Yeah , for her I was doing it !  |p238You  stay put here , " I said to the men behind the counter that the caterer had rigged up in one corner of the showroom . " All you do is keep mixing drinks and making sandwichesand whatever else you got there . That 's all . You just keep mixing them . Understand ? " " Yes , sir , " he said , and nodded . I turned to the three others . " And you three , you keep loading up your trays here with drinks and stuff and keep on circulating around . Keep moving all the time and keep your trays filled . Make sure everybody 's got enough to drink and eat . There 's gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I do n't want anybody to be thirsty . Understand ? " " Yes , sir , " they said , and nodded . I looked at my watch . " They ought to begin arriving pretty soon now . So all right , then , you fellows , you know what I want . Go to it , and if everything 's all right , there 'll be a nice little something extra for each one of you when it 's all over . Okay ? " " Yes , sir , " they said , and nodded . It was n't really as monotonous as it sounds . I even liked it a little , the way no matter what I said they yessed me and nodded . I turned to the long , low platform the carpenters had built along the wall opposite the windows . It stretched , like a stage , for about twenty feet down the showroom , beginningat the curtained doorway that led into the models '  |p239room  . I climbed the three low steps at the far end and walked along its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength . It was good and solid . At the end I stepped down , parted the curtains , and walked into the models ' room . There was so much noise and smoke in the room that nobodynoticed me . About twenty girls were jammed into the small space , dressing , undressing , smoking , and all the time jawing away at each other . In the middle , fitting a dress on a platinum blonde with a cute little fanny , was Meyer Babushkin . He had a tape measure around his neck , a mouthful of pins , and from the frown on his face you would think he was measuring his closest friend for a wooden overcoat . I rapped on the wall with a hanger until they heard me and began to quiet down a little . Then I held up my hand and said , " Can I have your attention for a minute , girls ? " I heard a few " Who 's that " s and " Who 's he " s and I heard my own models say , " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a few seconds they were quiet . " You all know what we want , girls , " I said , smiling pleasantly . " But just a quick summary before we begin . The guests 'll be arriving soon , and when they 're all here , say in about , oh , I do n't know , say a half hour or so , I 'll come to the doorway here and give you the word . Then you begin to file out slowly , in the order Mr. Babushkin told you about . After the show , when I give the word , you come down off the platform and mingle with the guests . Okay ? " " Yes , Mr. Bogen , " they said . " Fine , " I said . " And if everything goes all right , when it 's all over there 'll be a nice little something extra for every one of you . " They began to giggle and chatter , but I held up my hand for silence . " Everything okay , Meyer ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him . He was always shooting off his mouth . " That 's fine , " I said , and went out . So far it looked like I was the only one who thought so . The first thing I ran into was Teddy Ast , standing in the middle of the showroom , watching the caterer 's men and the platform and the decorations in the showroom with a face that looked like it could reach from here to Kocktebel , Russia . " Hello , Teddy , " I said cheerfully . " Boy , " he said , shaking his head , " what this thing cost ! " " So what ? " I said . He just looked around the large room again and shook his head . " Boy , oh , boy ! " " Ah , nuts , " I said . " Got a cigarette on you ? " He gave me one and held the match for me . " Boy , " he said again , " what this thing cost ! " " Pipe down , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . This is the way to sell dresses and make dough these days . Do n't worry so much about what this cost . We 'll get it all back spades doubled . " " Yeah , " he said , " we 'll get it back . In the pig 's eye . " The only reason I did n't say what I wanted to say or do what I wanted to do was that the front door opened and the first gang of buyers came in . " See if you can look alive there a little , " I said out of the corner of my mouth , and then we both went forward to meet them . Soon they were arriving so fast that one of us had to keep standing near the door to greet them . Teddy seemed to like the idea , so I said , " You better circulate around a little and see that everybody 's got enough to drink . " This wasp241my show and the buyers were going to remember me , not Teddy . By four o'clock most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So I climbed up onto the platform and rapped for silence . They turned to face me , holding drinks and cigarettes . " Ladies and gentlemen , " I said , flashing my best smile from one end of the room to the other , " may I have your attention ? " The large room became quiet . " Thank you , ladies and gentlemen , thank you , thank you , thank you . I want you all to know that I really and sincerelyappreciate your all showing up like this , and if there 's anything I 've forgotten , and it 's something anybody here thinks will in any way make this a bigger and better party , why , then , folks , let him speak up now and I , as the management , will do my little bit to see that he or she is taken care of properly . What say ? " I looked around the room , smiling , and they smiled back . But nobody spoke . " All right , then , " I said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said , " is Apex Modes . The president "  --  I pointed to myself  --  " is Harry Bogen . We are the proud parents , ladies and gentlemen , who present , for your approval , the apple of our eye  --  our new fall line . " There was a little applause , not much , because most of them were holding glasses or sandwiches , but a little . I ran down the three steps of the platform , stuck my head into the models ' room , and said , " Okay , Meyer . " " Okay , " he replied , and I stepped back , holding the curtainaway from the doorway . The first girl was a blonde . She stepped through the doorway , climbed the steps of the platform , turned slowly to show the lines of the dress , and moved down the platform.  | She was followed by a brunette . Then came a redhead and then a platinum . They followed each other like that slowly , a blonde , a brunette , a redhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long line of them , some twenty strong . They stood like that for a few moments , posing with their hands on their hips or clasped in front of them . Then the whole group turned slowly and came to rest again , like a line of statues . This time the applause was louder and longer . When I saw some of those . boozehounds actually set their glasses down so they could clap their hands , I knew the line was a hit . " Okay , girls , " I said , and they walked off the platform and began to mix with the crowd . A half dozen buyers , men and women , crowded around me . " Where did you get the models , Bogen ? They 're a knock-out ! " " Say , that 's some bunch of babies . Where 'd you get them ? " " Hey , Bogen ! I do n't see models like that around the other houses . How come ? " " That 's easy , " I said , laughing . " They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That 's the chorus of Smile Out Loud , " I said . " You mean that ? " " Sure , " I said . " Oh , boy , ' oh , boy , oh , boy ! Pick me that little redhead with the you know whats . Gangway , boys , here I go ! " Five minutes after the girls joined the crowd on the floor , the place was in an uproar . People kept slapping my back and spilling their drinks over me , but I did n't mind . The opening was a success . Not only were the dresses pips , butp243the idea of getting the chorus of a musical comedy to wear them had caught on . One of my regular models came up to me . " Mr. Bogen , " she said . " What 's the matter with Mr. Ast ? " She pointed to Teddy sulking in a corner . " What is he , drunk ? " He was n't , but it was as good an explanation as any . " Drunk ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sakes , he 's potted . Just let him alone and do n't worry about him . " The hell with him , I figured . Let him sulk . After all , he was the only one there that did n't seem to be having a good time . I poked my nose into the little group around Boonton of Arnolds-Tepperman . She bought the highest-priced stuff in the market , and the mere fact that she was present was something of a triumph . I knew the others , but I had never met her . " Everybody happy ? " I said , putting my arms around two of them . " Oh , Harry . It 's you . " " Harry Bogen , I want to congratulate you . You little louse , you 've got the hottest line on the Avenue , do you know that ? " " Thank you , my dear , " I said , bowing from the waist and grinning . " But that 's the general idea I had . " " You can take it from me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you know Miss Boonton ? " " Why , no , " I said , bowing again . It 's easy , once you get used to it . " I 've never had the pleasure . " If meeting Miss Boonton was a pleasure , then so is a case of piles . She had a figure like a subway kiosk and a face like the state of Texas done in three shades of pink . " All right , then , here goes . Miss Boonton , Mr. Bogen . Mr. Bogen , Miss Boonton. "  | " How do you do ? " I said . " Lousy , " she said in a voice that started somewhere about eighteen inches below her feet . " But seeing a line like that makes me feel better already . Who 's your designer ? " " Meyer Babushkin . " " Of Pulbetkal ? " she said , surprised . " Right . " " How in the God damned hell did you ever get the little kike away from Pulvermacher ? " I tapped my nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " So that 's the kind of guy you are , eh ? " she said , and we all burst out laughing . " Seriously , though , how come I have n't seen any of your stuff before ? " " We were making sixteen-seventy-fives up to now . " " I get it , " she said , giving me a shove . " Getting high hat , eh ? " I grinned . I could n't talk . That gentle shove of hers had knocked the wind out of me . It looked like I 'd have to join a gym if I wanted to sell the higher-priced trade . " Well , just watch out you do n't get so high class you do n't know the difference between a good dress and a lousy one . " " Not me , " I said , waving my hand from side to side . " I wrote a poem to remind myself . " " A what ? " " A poem . " " Listen , brother , " she said , grinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after all . A poem ! " " Sure , " I said , grinning back at her . " I always write poems in my spare time . In fact , I 'm just about the world 's champion lavatory poet . Most of my stuff is unpublished , but if you 've ever seen the walls of a men 's toilet , you 've seen  --  "  | " Jesus Christ , " she said , " you got me all excited . How does it go ? " So I had her all excited . " Like this , " I said , and swung into something real dirty . All of a sudden she broke into a squeal and collapsed into my arms . Now I know how it must feel to support the Woolworth Building when it begins to lean over too far . She shook up and down for a while until she recovered her breath . Sometimes I wished I could get as much pleasure out of my own jokes as the dopes I told them to did . It looked like I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , at least there was some little kick in knowing that I could adopt the right tone in a conversation , even down to the crummy jokes . " Mr. Bogen , " she said finally , " or maybe I better call you Harry . Yeah , Harry . Harry old kid , " she said , slapping me on the shoulder , and drying her eyes with her sleeve , " do I get a poem like that with every order I place with you ? " " You bet , " I said . And more . " Shake , kid , " she said . We shook , and she slapped me on the back once more . I did n't wince , though . I was getting used to it . " Hey , Molly , " she yelled suddenly at a woman across the room . " You wan na hear something ? " And she went chargingacross the crowded showroom , shoving people out of her way like a cowcatcher going through a snowdrift . She left just in time . My constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the rest of the room , and stopped with my mouth open . Standing near the platform , talking to two men , was the neatest-looking brunette I 'd ever seen . She stood so that I saw her in profile , and for a moment I could n't catch my breath . She had the kind of tits you could see coming around a corner ten minutes before the rest of her body followed . Ma-ma ! I walked over to Teddy and pointed her out to him . " Who 's the dame ? " He looked at me in surprise . " What are you , screwy ? " he said . " Why ? " " You do n't know who she is ? " I looked again . She was n't a buyer , she was n't one of my models , and she was n't wearing one of our dresses . I shook my head . " That 's a hot one all right , " he said , screwing up his lips . " You 're paying her , and you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's from Smile Out Loud ? " " Sure she is . " " Well , how come she is n't modeling one of our dresses , then ? " " Aw , she 's not just in the chorus . She does a specialty number . She sings or something . " " Oh , yeah ? You know so much about her , how about a knockdown ? " He looked disgusted . " Aw , Christ ! Why do n't you keep your mind on your work for a change , Harry ? What do you want to bother with those pots for ? " Get an earful of that ! He was giving me advice ! " Listen , " I said , " I 'm paying her , ai n't I ? All right , then . Come on . " I took his arm . " By the way , what 's her name ? " " Martha Mills , " he said.  | THERE are two kinds of dames . The kind you want to put , but with whom you would n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put , but with whom you get a kick out of being seen walking down the street . All the others do n't count . This dame was in class two . For three weeks in a row I took her out every night . We had dinner and talked until it was time for her to go to the theater . After the show I called for her and we made the rounds . Always , when the time came to take her home , I thought maybe to-night . But always that 's as far as I got , her front door . Sometimes , after I 'd had a chance to cool off a little and I was n't sore any more , I 'd stand there on the sidewalk in front of her apartment house for a while and ask myself was I crazy or was n't I. If somebody would 've told me that I 'd be spending the time and money on any dame that I was spending on her , and not even getting to first base , I would 've told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told it to myself , too . Yet there I 'd be , out on the sidewalk , with my hot pants to remind me that I was n't dreaming . Then I 'd get sore and say the hell with her and go home . Then , the next morning , sorting out the checks in my private office , going over the mail , I 'd remember the way we 'd looked the night before . I 'd remember the jealous looks of the heels around the stage door when I called for her . Or the way all eyes turned to look at us when we walked into a restaurant or a night club . Or the line in Winchell 's column , " Martha Mills , the baby-voiced warbler of Smile Out Loud is doing the hot spots with what prominentyoung manufacturer of feminine haberdashery ? " I 'd think of how swell it made me feel just to be seen walking down the street with her , and how people looked after her , and then at me , and wondered who I was and wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'd reach for the telephone . " Get me Riverside 9-0437 . " In a few seconds the girl at the switchboard would ring me . " Here 's your Riverside number , Mr. Bogen . " " Okay . " Then , " Hello , Martha ? " " Hello , Harry . " " How do you feel ? " " Sleepy . What 's the big idea waking me up so early in the morning ? " " Sorry , " I laughed . " I just wanted to make sure I was filing my application for to-night before the rest of the city . Anybody ahead of me yet , Martha ? " " You know there 's nobody ahead of you , Harry . " Crap me easy , kid , I thought . You 've played mumblety peg as much as I have . But I said , " Then how about to-night ? " " All right . " " Same time ? " " Same time . " " ' Bye , Martha . " " ' Bye . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as I 'd hang up I 'd begin remembering all the nights that had gone before , and I 'd begin thinking of the one that was coming , and wondering if it would be the same . Then I 'd begin think/ing what a holy schmuck I was making of myself , and I 'd get so sore at myself I felt like calling her back and telling her to drop dead . But this time I did n't get a chance to get sore . Because before I could put the receiver back on the hook the door opened and Teddy Ast came in . " Hello , Theodore , " I said , " how 's the world treating you ? " He slapped a thin packet of blue-covered papers on my desk . " I just been looking through the accountant 's report , " he said . " Why , Teddy ! " I said , surprised . " You did n't tell me you knew how to read ! " " Never mind , " he said grimly . " I just been looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , picking up my copy . " Looks pretty good , does n't it ? " I leafed through it to the operating statement . " Eight thousand net for the month . Not bad . Not bad at all . " His face squeezed up a little tighter and he turned to the schedule of expenses . " Traveling and entertaining , " he read , " twenty-two hundred dollars . " I picked my teeth with my tongue but did n't say anything . " Well , " he said , " what 've you got to say to that ? " " You really want to know ? " I said . " Yeah , " he said . " All I have to say is : in your hat and over your ears ; you look good in brown .

" " My error , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was so sore that his hand shook when he lit a cigarette . But I did n't say a word . He was dumb enough to dig his own grave . He did n't need any help from me . " What are you gon na do about it ? " he said . " About what ? " He hit the desk with the rolled up report . " Do n't give me any of that , Harry . You know what . What about those entertaining expenses ? " " Well , what about them ? " " You gon na cut them out ? " " No , " I said . " I 'm having a lot of fun spending that money , and it 's good for the business . If you got any objections , spit them out . " " Listen , Harry . " " What do you think I 'm doing ? " He shook off the interruption . " From the first minute we opened up here , you 've been throwing money around like water . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , not much . " But this is different . " I picked up a sheaf of orders from my desk and waved them under his nose . " Where the hell do you think these came from ? How the hell do you think we got these ? Just by showing your phiz around to the buyers ? Do n't kid yourself , Teddy , " I said , " you 're not that good-looking . " " Do n't try to hide things . What do you think I am , a dope ? " " Sure , " I said , grinning . He glared at me . " Well , I 'm not as dumb as you think . When you spent allp251that dough , I figured all right , it was on buyers , it was for the business . But you ca n't keep pulling that crap on me . The whole damn market knows what you 're doing . When you start pissing away the firm dough on a pot like that , on an actress , where we do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to object . " " You all finished ? " I said calmly . He did n't answer . " Now you listen to me for a change , " I said . " First of all you 're such a dumb bastard you do n't even know what you 're talking about . And secondly , where did you ever get this ' I got a right ' business ? If I want to spend money endowinga hospital for cats , I 'll do it , and I wo n't ask for any advice from you , either . " " I do n't care what the hell you do with your own money , " he said , " but when you start spending firm money , then I got a right  --  " " Yeah ? Who ever told you that ? " " I 'm a partner , ai n't I ? " " But I happen to own sixty per cent of the stock , " I said , grinning at him , " and maybe I 'll endow that hospital for cats after all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , breathing quickly . " Ido n't care what you say , I 'm still a partner here , and  --  " " Then maybe you and I better just stop being partners , " I said . " That suits me , " he said , slapping the report onto the desk and turning on his heel . " It ca n't suit you any more than it suits me , " I said . " We 'll go down to Golig to-morrow . " " The quicker the better , " he said , and slammed the door . With the door closed behind him I could n't hold it any longer . I just had to laugh out loud . It could n't have worked out any better if he 'd 've been killed in a railroad wreck . He had taught me all he knew a long time ago . As far as I was concerned he 'd shot his load . I picked up the receiver and spoke to the girl at the switchboard . " Tell Mr. Babushkin I want to see him right away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under her and she had done things to her lips and hair she looked up at me with a smile and said , " Now go on with your story , Harry . " " Where was I ? " I asked , sweeping my eyes from her thick black hair , that looked like a greased helmet , down her tiny button nose and thick red lips to her chest . From there I could n't go any further . That chest , with the dress bunched up and drawn tightly across it , had never failed to stop me yet . " I do n't know exactly , " she said , shaking herself a little and clearing my mind of any doubts as to whether she was wearing a brassiere , " but when you decided in such a hurry that we had enough of Seventy-Seven  --  By the way , why do you always want to go from one place to another ? We 're no sooner settled in one place , than you want to get out and go some place else . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling at her , and watching out of the corner of my eye the way the people at the next table kept staring at us . " Oh , so you have a reason . Well , what is it ? " " I get a kick out of walking in and out of places with you , " I said . " Oh , Harry ! " she squealed , covering her mouth to stop the laugh , and sending her chest shivering all over the lot in a way that made me grip the edge of the table to keep my hands from running away with themselves . " That 's the truth , Martha , " I said . " Honest . "  | " Oh , Harry , cut it out . " " I mean it , Martha , " I said . " You 're not like other girls . " Which was the bull . Upside down they all look alike . " You ought to see the way people look at us , at you , rather , when we come into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we go out . So I leave it to you . The more times we get up and go out , the more times we walk in , which means the more times people look at us , and the more kick I get . See ? " " Oh , Harry , you 're funny . " " Well , I ca n't help it , " I said . " So far , that 's the only real pleasure I 've had from going with you . " She looked at me quickly and then down at the tablecloth . Bull 's eye ! Score one for the old marksman ! For the time being this dame had me stopped . But I was n't quitting yet . I had too much of an investment in her already . And besides , to be honest about it , I could n't have quit if I 'd wanted to . Not while she was built the way she was . And not while she was an actress . And not while every guy on Broadway that saw us together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of your story ? " she said . " Oh , yes , " I said , putting my thumb in my vest , " my story . Now , ah , where , ah , was I ? " " Mr. Ast , " she said , mimicking my voice , and grinning , " had just told you he did n't like the way you were running the business and he wanted you to  --  " " Oh , yes , " I said . " So I said , Teddy , I said , my hearing is n't so good these last few days , so maybe I did n't get you right the first time . But did I understand you to say , I said , did I understand you to say that you did n't like the way I was running the business ? And he said yes . So I sort of leaned back in my chair and shook my head like I 'd just gotten the news my mother died or something , you know , and I said , gee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is toop255bad , I said , because you know , Teddy , I 'm a funny guy , and I would n't be able to sleep well at night if I knew a partner of mine did n't like the way I was running things . " " What did he say to that ? " she said , laughing . " What could he say ? Nothing . So I continued , and I said in that case , Teddy , seeing as how you and I do n't sort of , well , you know , sort of agree on things , then maybe it would n't be a half bad idea if you and I , we stopped being partners from now on . Well , Martha , as soon as I said that , you should 've seen the look on his face . He started to cry and this and that and the other , you know , and tried to talk me out of it , but I just shook my head like a pallbearer , you know , and I said sorry , Teddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partners if I felt that you did n't like the way I was running things . He tried a little more crying , you know , because he knew what a dope he was for letting himself out of one of the most profitable businesses in the city . " If she could n't take that hint , she was blind . " So the only thing left for him to do was to get tough . Well , Martha , " I said , pausing to light a cigarette , " I 'm not sayingI 'm the bravest guy in the world . If Jack Dempsey would get tough with me , then maybe I 'd just say yes , sir . But when a baloney like Teddy Ast gets tough with me , then Martha , old kid , I get so tough myself that you 'd think I chewed battleships and spit rust . " " Well , what happened ? " " Nothing , " I said , waving my hand . " Nothing much , I just picked up the little heeb "  --  what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him by his collar and kicked him out of my office . And that was the end of my partner Teddy Ast . " " You mean just like that you got rid of him ? " " Oh , well , " I said , dusting my ashes elaborately , " just like I get rid of anything else I ca n't use . " Hm . " There were a couple of minor details , of course , but I 'd taken care of all that in advance . I knew he 'd run to Babushkin , so I 'd spoken to Babushkin in advance . I knew he 'd run to the lawyer , so I 'd fixed it with Golig in advance . In fact , before Teddy Ast knew what hit him , he was out on his ear with nothing but his original investment and his share of the profits to date , which , compared to what that business is capable of earning , is the equivalent of not only taking his shirt , but his pants too . " " You mean that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she said , leaning toward me across the table . The light began to dawn so suddenly , that for a moment I almost forgot to look down into the front of her dress . But you do n't get as far as I 've come if you have n't got a halfway decent portion of self-control . So I managed to keep my face straight and at the same time get my look in , too . Hell , I was paying for it . " Practically , " I said . " I 've still got Babushkin , but I really need him . He 's my designer . But I 'm not worrying about him . There 's one thing you can be sure he 'll never die from , and that 's brains . " " Gosh , Harry , " she said , shaking her head at me admiringly . " A young man like you , with a business like that ! " Well , anyway , it looked admiringly . But whether it was or it was n't , there was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of Apex Modes , Inc. , Harry Bogen , to you . " This is only the beginning , " I said . " You just watch my smoke . " Smoke was right . I was hot enough to burn . " How about another drink ? " I said . " Waiter ! " " Oh , no , Harry , please ! I 've had enough . " " Let 's get something to eat , then . " " Gosh , " she laughed , " do n't you ever want to do anything but eat ? "  | " Sure , " I said quickly , " but this is about as good a substituteas I know . " Am I subtle ! Boy , like an after-dinner speaker . " Yes , sir ? " the waiter said at my elbow . I looked at her . " No , nothing , Harry . " " Check , please , " I said to the waiter . In the cab going uptown I put my arm around her , but when we came to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , call me in the morning , " I was n't surprised . I was disappointed , but not surprised . And even though I was in the same place I 'd been every night at the same time for almost a month , out on the sidewalk , this time I was n't sore . The first time she 'd stopped me at the door , I admit I was surprised . Maybe , I thought , maybe , Mama knows best . Teddy had said she had some kind of a heel of a husband floating around somewhere , but I did n't attach much importance to that . I did n't even ask too much about it . It was enough for me that they did n't live together . That 's all I ever want to know about husbands . So at first I figured maybe I 'd picked a foul ball . But then I remembered how attractive she was , and all the guys hanging around her in the showroom . There was no sense in kidding myself . She had dates and she went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that goes out with a married guy , it 's not so he can read poetry to her , either . So why should it be any different for me ? If she would n't have been married , I 'd have thought well , maybe . But she was married , or she 'd been married . So what was one more slice off a cut loaf ? The first time I figured all right , maybe the flag was up . But I 'd seen her every night for almost a month . So that was out , too . Which left what ? Until to-night the answer was search me . But now the answer was different.  | And that 's why , even though I was still standing out on the sidewalk , this time I was n't sore , the way I 'd been every other night . Because this time I had the combination . Now , at last , I had the formula . From now on at least I knew where I was going . I was going to play her way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell did I care about that ? She was an actress , was n't she ? Actresses were n't like bookkeepersor stenographers or models . You had to play them differently . But that was all . Once you got the hang of the game , the rest was the same . And whether dear old Martha knew it or not , she was going to come through with a bang . The best part of all , though , was that I had a hunch she knew it all right.  | MOTHER pretended to be surprised when she saw me . " Oh , " she said , " look who we have to-night ! A guest in the town ! " That was a nice way to start off an evening that I knew in advance was going to be lousy . " What 's the matter , Ma ? " " Nothing , " she said , setting the table as she talked . " Only it 's getting already a surprise to see you when it 's still light enough so we should n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of bread , but she pushed my hand away . " Here 's the point , " she said , giving me the hard brown end of the loaf . " I saved it for you . " " Thanks , Ma , " I said . I bit into the rubbery chunk and chewed slowly . " What time did you get home last night ? " " Oh , it was n't late , " I said . I was thinking fast , trying to shift the conversation to another subject  --  it would get back to this soon enough  --  but I could n't . " Sure it was n't late , " she said . " He comes home God knows when  --  fourteen , fifteen o'clock  --  so by him it 's not late . Sure not . It 's already early in the morning . " " Aah , Ma . " She screwed up her face and twisted her lips in an exaggerated imitation of my expression and said , " Aah ,  |p26o  Ma ! Aah , Ma ! Everything I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him always Aah , Ma ! ' " She made a motion of disgust with the ladle she was holdingand turned back to the pots on the gas range . After a few moments I said , " Well , Ma , what do you know that 's new ? Anything happen during the day ? " " What do you want should happen ? The skies should fall ? The ocean should dry up ? What do you , want should  --  ? " " No , " I said , " I was just asking , that 's all . Ca n't I ask a simple little question like that , without you getting all excited ? " " Who 's excited ? " she demanded . " You see maybe I 'm excited ? You ask questions like a donkey , so I answer them you should understand . That means I 'm excited ? Go , go , eat better . Talk a little less and eat a little more . The talkingis n't worth by you anything , anyway , so at least do a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking of the best way to begin . But I knew it was useless . There was n't even one good way . So how could there be a best way ? " Oh , yeah , " Mother said suddenly , turning from the gas range with a plate in her hands . " I forgot to tell you . Ruthie called you up . " " I guess it just accidentally slipped your mind , did n't it ? " I said . " Yeah , " she said , " I forgot all about it . " Yeah ! Like she forgot to collect from me when the end of the week came around . I continued to eat in silence . " About seven o'clock , she called . Maybe a few minutes after . " " That 's not a bad time to call , " I said , still eating.  |p261She  set the plate down before me and took up the one I had been using . " I told her you were n't home , " she said . " Since I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing you could do . After all , there 's no sense in lying about it . " " Do n't you wan na know what she said ? " " No , " I said . " I can guess . " She set down the pot she was holding with a bang and turned to face me , her hands on her hips . " Listen , Heshie , " she began . " Please , Ma , " I said . " Let 's not get into an argument over Ruthie Rivkin . I did n't come home for that to-night . " " No ? " " No . " " Then maybe you 'll do me a big favor and tell me why you all of a sudden became  --  God forbid !  --  so kind to me that you came home for a change to-night ? Maybe you 'll tell me that ? " Well , there was the opening . What the hell was I afraid of ? " Nothing , " I said . " What ever gave you the idea I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said sarcastically . " Except only for God knows how many weeks already you 've been coming home with the chickens , three , four o'clock in the morning , ruining your health  --  " " I am not , " I said angrily . " I feel all right . So what if I do come home a little late ? I do n't get up till late the next morning , do I ? " " In my house , " she said , " you 'll do your sleeping at night , like regular people , not during the day . " " All right , all right , " I said , mumbling in a low voice to make her forget the long speech she had been starting out on.  | " So , " she continued , " after so many weeks of showing your face for a couple of minutes in the morning , before you grab your behind in your hands and run like a crazy one downtown , now , to-night you all of a sudden come home half-past seven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit down with a face long like a horse , and then you ask me how I know you came home for a special reason ? What am I all of a sudden , a dope ? " " Aah , hell , Ma , that 's  --  " " Never mind with the Aah , hell , Ma ' business . I know you a little longer than you know yourself , my Heshalle . You became all of a sudden smart since you became a businessman . But I was smart yet when you were peeing in the diapers , Heshalle . You can be smart with those dumbbells you got for partners . But do n't think you can be smart with me . " I figured there was no sense in trying to put one over on her . " All right , Ma , " I said quietly , " I did come home early for a special purpose . " " For what ? " " I wanted to tell you something , " I said , smiling suddenly and talking lightly . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to be living away from home for a while , Ma . " I should have known better than to try to treat it humorously . Her own manner changed abruptly . The anger went out of her face and she dropped into her chair at the table , facing me across the dishes . " You 're not going to live home , " she said quietly . " It 's only for a little while , Ma , " I said . " Maybe a couple of weeks or so . Till we get the new line going good . " She stared at me without speaking for a few moments.  |p263Then  she said , " You know , Heshie , sometimes I wish you were back again working for fifteen dollars a week . " " Aah , Ma , that 's no way to talk . This wo n't be for long . It 's only on account of business that I 'm doing it . " " Business ! " she said bitterly . " It is business , Ma , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . It 's on account of business I 'm doing it . " She shook her head . " I do n't say you 're lying to me , Heshie . I do n't say it 's not business , " she said . " Then what 's the sense of feeling that way about it ? " I said . " The way you act , Ma , somebody would think I was dying or something . " " It 's the same thing , " she said . " Since you started with that business of yours , you 're not the same . The business sees you more than I do . " " Do n't say that , Ma . It 's not true . " " I do n't have to say it , " she said . " Other people say it . The neighbors they say it . I get all dressed up . I put on the fancy clothes you bought me . I put on the fur collar . I walk in the street . The neighbors they stop me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me where I get the nice things . I tell them I have a son and how good he is to me . And they look at me like I was a little crazy . You have a son , they say ? They never see you . You 're all the time buried in that business of yours . " " What do you care what the neighbors say ? " I said . " Does it matter to you what they say ? You still have me , have n't you ? It 's not like I 'm going away to Europe or something . I 'll still be here in the city . And it 'll only be for a couple of weeks or so . I 'll send you all the money you need . I 'll send you dresses and things like that . I 'll even bring them up to you when I 'm not busy . You know that , Ma. "  | " What 's the good of having fine clothes , of having a fur collar , if when you walk in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for yourself ? How do people know I have a son if they never see you ? " " Well , I could see where she 'd be working that line to death for a while . I swear , if I had the guts , I 'd handle these things by mail . " I think you pay too much attention to what the neighborssay . If they want to talk , let them talk . I ca n't run my business to suit the neighbors , Ma . " " There 's other people in business , Heshie . Not only you . Why is it other people , they run their business , they make a living , they come home at night to their wives , to their children , to their mothers . Why should it be different for you ? " " Because I 'm in business differently from them . They work like niggers , they make a little profit , they come home , and they 're satisfied . They might just as well be working for somebody else for a salary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way . If you want to get rich in business , Ma , there 's no time for coming home at night and sitting down and wasting time . You 've got to work at it twenty-four hours a day . When I 'm through at the place , I have to take buyers out , I have to entertain , I have to do a thousand things , Ma . I ca n't be satisfied with just a little bit . I ca n't sit back and say all right , I 'm getting by , I 'll take a rest . I ca n't do that , Ma . " " But why ? " she cried . " Why should it be different for you ? Why should n't you be satisfied with a little , like everybody else ? What do you need the whole world money for ? " " I do n't know , Ma , " I said , shaking my head . " It 's hard to explain those things . I could do things the way the others do . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules . With me it'sp265a question of giving as much as I 'm taking . If I wanted to be satisfied with a little money , so I 'd spend a little time in my business . But I want a lot of it , so I have to spend a lot of time at it , that 's all . But what 's the sense of talking , " 1 said , " you do n't understand , Ma . " " Do n't worry , Heshie , " she said . " I understand only too well . " First she said she did n't understand . Then she said she did . Well , that 's the Bogens . We learn fast . " I 'll be living downtown for a while , Ma , " I said . " And that 's all . It 's not going to kill anybody . " She looked at me without blinking , as though she had n't heard my last words . " You know what I sit here and try to figure out , Heshie ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing like a few months in business could change a person so . What , " she asked , " what can your business give you that your own mother ca n't ? " Martha Mills instead of Ruthie Rivkin , for one thing , if she really wanted to know . " I swear , Ma , " I said , shaking my head and smiling at her , " you ought to be an actress . All I keep hearing is how I 'm changing . What kind of silly talk is that ? I 'm changing ! What am I , getting taller ? My nose is getting shorter ? My hair is changing from black to red ? " " I wish it only was that , " she said . So did I. " Then let 's forget the whole thing , " I said , starting to get up . " I do n't know how the hell we ever get into these long-winded arguments  --  " She continued to stare at me , without moving , and I dropped back into my chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said .   " Yeah ?

" It makes me sore as hell to have to go around insisting I 'm honest . " Just because I do n't go around like a damn fool saying I love you and all that , that does n't mean anything . I do n't like that kind of silly talk , Ma , that 's all . It sounds fake . I like people should have , well , they should have dignity , they should act like grown-up human beings . The way you act , Ma . I do n't like to talk like a baby . But hell , " I said , " if you want me to do that , all right , I will .

That 's what those rules of yours , that 's what your way of doing business , did for you . " " That 's not true , Ma , " I said . " I feel the same as I always did . I 'm not different . " She nodded and smiled a little . But it was n't funny to see . " Yes you are , Heshie , " she said . " You said it yourself . There used to be a time when you had to come home at night . You said you had to come home and sit by the table and eat blintzes and stretch your legs out and get a rest where nobody is going to jump on you from the back , like you said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you said you had to come home because here it 's not  --  you said it yourself  --  here it 's not dog eat dog .

" " I do n't know what wound you up to-day , Ma , " I said , shaking my head . " I come home and tell you a simple little thing like that I have to sleep downtown for a couple of weeks because of business , and you give me a long speech about I do n't like you any more , I do n't have to come home any more , I do n't have to do this , I do n't need that , I 'm changed  --  for crying out loud , Ma , what 's going on here ? " " Maybe a year ago you would have understood me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishes . " But now  --  " She shrugged . " Maybe it 's my fault , too , " she said . " Maybe I should have talked to you before . But now , now I 'm afraid it 's too late . You 're changed , Heshie , you 're changed . " A guy can stand just so much , even from his own mother . " But what the hell kind of talk is that ? " I cried , raising my voice to a shout suddenly , and jumping out of my chair . " What kind of changed ' ? I feel the same way I ever felt . I act the same way I ever acted . Where do you get this changed ' stuff ? Maybe I have a little more money . Maybe I 'm a little smarter . But what  --  ?

It sounded like a musical comedy sketch , but boy , did I love it ! When the phone rang I picked it up and said , " Hello , West Side Garage ? This is Mr. Bogen of Apex . Bring my car around right away , will you ? Yeah , on the Thirty-Eighth Street side . I 'll be down in ten minutes . All right ? "   " Yes , sir . " What , no Mr. Bogen ?

" The little bitch . From the way she deared me all over the lot , you 'd think we 'd been sleeping together since the Armistice . " I 'm great , " I said . " And you ? " " All right . " " How about a little lunch ? " " So early ? " " Well , I want to do a couple of things before we eat . I want to show you something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 'll be up in a half hour , then . " " Harry dear , give a girl a chance to dress ! " " You do n't have to work too hard at it , " I said . " You look good to me as is . " " Oh , Harry ! " Oh , Harry , my ass . " So what do you say , will you be ready when I get there ? " " I 'll try , dear . "  | " Okay , then , ' bye . " " ' Bye , dear . " On my way through the office the bookkeeper stopped me . " Will you be back , Mr. Bogen ? " " I do n't know . I might . What 's the matter ? " She waved her desk diary at me . " We 've got to make some payments to-day , Mr. Bogen , and if  --  " " Put the checks on my desk , " I said . " I 'll sign them when I get back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't kill them if they get their checks a day later . " The car was waiting for me at the curb . I 'd had it for three days already , but it was such a beauty , that every time I saw it I had to stop for a few seconds and just look at it , " There she is , Mr. Bogen , " the man from the garage said . " Thanks . " I got in and drove uptown . I did n't say anything to her until we got out of the elevator and into the street . Then , instead of hailing a cab , the way I usually did , I walked her over to the car and reached for the yellow door . " Why , Harry , do n't tell me this is yours ! " All right , so I wo n't tell you . " Like it ? " She clasped her hands and said , " It 's a beauty , Harry . When did you get it ? " " A couple of days ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be adjusted . " She walked around it and ran her hand along the edge of the door and said again , " It 's a beauty , Harry . " " Hop in , " I said , " and we 'll see how she runs . " for you Wholesale 271p271I drove down to Seventy-Second , turned right , and brought the car to a stop in front of the Montevideo . " Where are we going ? " I grinned at her and said , " I want to show you some-thing . " The doorman opened the car and I helped her out . She held back a little as we walked into the large foyer , but I patted her shoulder and said , still grinning , " Do n't you be afraid , little girl . You 're safe . There 's a carpenter and a plumber and a couple of painters upstairs that 'll act as chaperons . " The elevator stopped at twenty-one without my saying a word . There 's some difference between the elevator operatorsin a loft building and the elevator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I walked to the door at the end of the small hallway and threw the door open . I did n't see a carpenter , but the two painters who were working in the large living room looked up at us and I could hear the plumber in the bathroom . " There 're your chaperons , " I said . She looked at me sideways , smiling a little , and walked in . We paraded through the living room , into the bedroom , out into the living room again , into the kitchen , peeked into the bathroom , came back into the living room and parked ourselves in front of the wide windows that looked out onto the park . " Well , " I said , " what do you think of it ? " " What am I supposed to say , Harry ? " " Oh , there 's no script , " I said , waving my hand at her . " You can ad lib . " She looked around the large room again , then out the window , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salvation Army or something ? " " No , " I said , laughing , " it 's all for a very close friendP172of yours . A gent by the name of Harry Bogen . Remember him ? " " I 've got a faint recollection , " she said , looking around the room once more , then at me , with her tongue in her cheek a little and the kind of a look in her eye that is some-. - times referred to as calculating . " What 's the big idea ? " " Oh , I do n't know . I just got tired of the old dump , that 's all . And now , of course , " I added , " now that I 'm traveling around in such high-class company , you know "  --  she bowed a little and I bowed back  --  " why , I figured it was time I moved into a decent place . See what I mean ? " She said she saw . " Now tell the truth , Martha , what do you think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing , " all I know so far is that it 's one of the nicer apartments at the Montevideo . Which is enough , believe me . But to tell you the truth , Harry "  --  she waved her hands to take in the room  --  " it 's still kind of empty , is n't it ? " " That , " I said , " is where you come in . " She looked at me quickly , and I realized suddenly what I 'd said . But I did n't bother to correct the impression . " We 're going out this afternoon to buy me some furniture , " I said . I patted my breast pocket . " I got the old checkbook with me , and anything you pick out , that 's what I buy . " Almost anything , anyway . " What do you say ? " " I say okay . " " Great , " I said , putting my arm around her and walking her to the door . " Let 's eat first . " With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checks . She had so much class , that when we walked into a store , the salesmen fell all over themselves for the chance to wait on us . And she had taste , too . None of this fancy crap for her . Personally , I did n't much care what she bought . As long as the furniture included a double bed , I was satisfied . P273But she was particular . And so long as her being particular did n't mean more money out of my pocket , she could be particular until the salesmen passed out . After three hours I said , " All right for to-day . We 'll get the rest to-morrow . You tired ? " " No , " she said ; then , " well , maybe a little . " " Come on , " I said , " we 'll get a hot drink of something and then go for a drive in the park . All right ? " " All right , Harry . " I was a little tired myself , so I drove back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cab . I put my arm around her and held her hand in my lap . After the cab entered the park , I did n't speak for a while . Then , still holding her close , and looking out the window , I said , " What have you got against me , Martha ? " " Nothing , " she said , " I 've got nothing against you , Harry . " The fact that she was n't surprised showed she knew what I was talking about . " Do n't you like me ? " " Sure I like you , Harry , " she said . Then , as though she were afraid she had n't made herself clear , she added , " I like you a lot , Harry . " Boy , she was smooth . I figured the time was ripe for a straight shot , right through the middle . " Why do you turn me down , Martha ? " I said , still lookingout of the window . She stiffened a little in the bend of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry , " she said . " I like you a lot and all that , but , well  --  I 'm just not that kind of a girl , Harry . " And I was Little Lord Fauntleroy . I did n't say anything . I could feel her head turn a little as she tried to get a look at me to see if it had registered .   But I continued to look out of the window , without speaking . " I like you , Harry , " she said again , to drive the point home , " but it 's just that I do n't know you well enough . " She began to talk more quickly , as though she 'd been struck by a better idea . " That 's the trouble with you : you 're so sure right away that you 're in love , that you want the woman to be the same . But a woman has to take time , Harry , and be really sure . She has too much to lose . " What the hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't rush into those things . " All right . Call it love . I had my own word for it . We 'd soon see which of the two was more accurate . I still had a couple of blank checks on me . I leaned forward and tapped on the glass . " Driver , " I said , " take us to Tiffany 's . Thirty-seventh and Fifth . " And , to drive my point home , I repeated , " Tiffany 's . "   IF IT was any other guy I would have said he was a horse 's ass and she was taking him over . But I did n't say it for two reasons . Nobody calls me a horse 's ass , and nobody takes me over . I knew she thought I was a big sucker . But she was n't putting anything over on me . I knew what I was doing . I picked up the receiver and spoke to the girl at the switchboard . " Send in one of the boys from the back , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mama for thirty and the other to cash for five hundred . I put the first one in an envelope , addressed it , sealed it , and sat back to wait for the boy . What if the wrist watch had cost four hundred bucks ? So what ? First of all , half of that was really coming out of Babushkin 's pocket , although he did n't know it , which made that all right . And secondly , I was n't even thinking about the price . Some dames are worth ten times that amount . Maybe not to other guys . But what the hell did I care about other guys ? I figured like this : when I took , I took hard . And when I gave , I gave hard . If I took more than my share  --  well , there were some things you had to give more for than they were worth . Like Martha Mills . What if she did cost a lot ? To me she was worth it . And until I got what t wanted I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on taking . The boy came in . P173bankbook . " Here . I got  --  thirty-seven , thirty-seven-fif  --  oh , about thirty-seven hundred . " " Not bad , " I said . " Not bad at all . " He put the book down and looked at me . " Say , what is this , Harry , anyway ? " " I 'll tell you , Tootsie , " I said quietly . " I just came from the doctor . " " What 's the matter ? " he said . " You sick or something ? " I sighed and looked sad . It 's easy to do . " That 's about the size of it , I guess , " I said . " That 's tough all right . What is it ? " " Oh , I do n't know . Complications and things like that . You know . You ca n't get anything straight out of those doctors . You know how they are . " " Gee , that 's tough , Harry . " Was it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I look . " He leaned forward in his chair and frowned a bit . " Well , what did he say ? " " I have to lay off for a while . He said I have to knock off for a while and take a good rest . " He leaned back and his face relaxed . " Well , that 's easy , " he said . " You can go and  --  " " I 'm afraid it 's not as easy as it sounds , Tootsie . He said I have to knock off . Not just for a couple of weeks or so , either . " " That 's all right , Harry . Why do n't you go away and just  --  ? " I shook my head . " No , Tootsie . It 's not all right . He said I have to go away for over a year . Maybe even more . " His mouth hung open , like a basketball goal . I wanted to crumple up a blotter and toss it in , to see if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I shook my head . " Maybe even more , " I said . " Gee whiz . " I got up and scratched my head . " That 's what I wanted to see you about , " I said , talking without looking at him , moving around his chair slowly . " A guy ca n't just leave a business like this for over a year and then expect to come back like nothing happened . It would n't be fair . It would n't be fair to you , Tootsie . " " Aah , hell , Harry , " he said . " You and I , we went into this thing together  --  " " I know what you 're gon na say , Tootsie , and do n't you think for one minute I do n't appreciate it . I want you to know I appreciate it all right , and I think it 's damn nice of you , too . But , well , you know how it is , Tootsie . A guy ca n't do those things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just does n't work out . " He did n't say anything for a few moments , just chewed his lip . He was so fat that if he ever got shipwrecked , he could keep himself alive for quite some time by doing that . Then he said , " What are you gon na do ? " " Oh , I do n't know , Tootsie . But you do n't have to worry about me . I 've got a few thousand saved up . I 'll just go away some place , maybe Europe or some place like that , you know , and then , maybe when I come back  --  but hell , I 'm not worrying about that now . My health comes first . " " Sure , " he said . " That 's one of the reasons why I asked you if you saved any of your money , Tootsie , " I said . " I want to sell you my interest in the business . " His mouth dropped down to his third rib . Once more and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular basketball could get in. "
