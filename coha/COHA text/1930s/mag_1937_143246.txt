An engagement that the British Royal Family takes as seriously as anything on its calendar is the annual Armistice Day ceremony at Whitehall 's Cenotaph . Standing bareheaded at such a service nine years ago George V caught the cold from which he never fully recovered , yet to repeated suggestions that this ceremony in the murderous November damp be given up , the Royal Family has always turned a deaf ear . <P> Last week every Briton with a radio and the 3,000 odd who own television sets received much more at this service than they expected . In the pinkly flickering tubes of their televisors they could see King George stiffly standing before the Cenotaph in a Field Marshal 's khaki-colored greatcoat , beyond him , the British Cabinet in funereal black , beyond them a double row of bluejackets rigidly at attention , behind them the windows of the Home Office where Queen Elizabeth and Queen Mother Mary watched the ceremony . Big Ben bonged eleven times and a sudden dramatic silence blanketed the entire city of London . <P> Skittering through the guards slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouting : " Stop all this hypocrisy ! You are deliberately preparing for war ! " <P> Before he could say or do more , panting overcoated policemen pounced on him , knocked him to the pavement , bloodied his nose . King George and the Cabinet stood like ramrods , eyes front , ignoring the scuffle ( see cut ) . Queen Elizabeth gasped , clutched at her throat , then relaxed when danger was past . The tousled protestant turned out to be one Stanley Storey , escaped from the Cane Hill Insane Asylum on Sept. 21 . <P> Throughout the rest of London only three incidents marred the solemnity of of the two-minute silence . At Ludgate Circus an iron-lipped whistler continued to shrill Night Must Fall until a crowd threatened to lynch hihim , and at Spitalfield Market Church the sentimental silence was shattered by a realist who suddenly shouted : " The dead are all right . What about me ? I have n't had any breakfast ! " Police had to rescue him . <P> In Regent 's Park Pond a middle-aged patriot was placidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand upright in his skiff and splashed overboard . Coming to the surface he stood waist-deep in muck and cold water , head bowed for 90 seconds before squishing ashore .
