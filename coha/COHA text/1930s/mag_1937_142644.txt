And the Northern Lights flapped like curtains in a storm . It all reflected , said Dr. A. G. McNish , authority on the earth 's magnetism , in Washington last week for a meeting of the American Geophysical Union , the worst magnetic storm in a century . This in turn was due to a great magnetic storm which swept across the face of the sun four days earlier and sent a gust of electric corpuscles toward the earth at 270 mi. per sec .
