MOROCCO , long an empire guarded from the coveting eyes of Europe by the will of a proud and exclusive people , remains in her subjection a land tempting to the traveler in search of new and even rude experiences . She is a country up-to-date . accessible , civilized ; yet barbarous , antique , and forhidden . She is French , Spanish , Berber , Arab , and Jew . She has been nursed for a thousand years on the subtle policies of the Orient , though farther west than the greater part of Europe . Her emperors , some of whom were lords and masters of Spain , built great cities and castles and palaces and fortresses , before America had come out of the Land of Dreams . They endowed universities and colleges for the cultivation of learning , the terms of whose foundations resemble those at Oxford and Cambridge ; with some of which they were contemporary . The same cloistered beauty is to be found in both ; the same lofty ideals of faith and devotion . They assembled in their prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fleets that swept the Christian seas . Though children born of the desert , they arrogated to themselves great pretensions ; claiming the Divine Right , not merely as kings but as saints by lineage . Their tombs , where ruin has spared them , remain as lovely as any in the world ; their gardens of running waters are still a delight to those permitted to enter them . And vet , half the population of this country lives on in the ways of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . WHERE 20 CENTURIES HAVE BEEN COMPRESSED INTO 20 YEARS She is an Eastern land in the marrow of her bones , though placed in Africa ; and she has been penetrated through centuries by European influences , which lie deep under the surface of her oriental life . Her camel caravans remain coeval with the airplane ; and a tribesman of the desert , wounded in battle , can find himself carried through the air to a French hospital across the whole width of impenetrable Atlas . Twenty centuries have here been compressed into as many years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rockies or the Alps ; valleys profound and lovely ; cedars as noble as those of Lebanon ; olive groves like those of Delphi ; vines that grow wild , or are as cultivated now as those of Provence ; cities like Fes which belong to the Arabian Nights , and Marrakech the Granada of Morocco , which glows in her fierce sunlight girdled by palm  | oases , within a day 's march of snow-covered summits , " white as salmon " as Drake observed them in the course of his circumnavigation of the world ; cities and peoples passionate with the fury and excess of Africa , yet profoundly inspired by the worship of the One God , their compassionate and merciful Allah ! For these and other reasons , this country grips one , though the world he at one 's disposal ; and I come to find that each visit I pay there , intending it to be the last , becomes but the doorway to another . In this I discover a special reason ; for I am caught , like those who live and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continual advance . Each year the pacified frontier of this violent and poetic.land marches on into regions unknown . Each year I find some new tract become accessible : old castles unsuspected , and chieftains living in them in medieval state ; clans and tribesmen at war , now gathered into the fold ; maps that record a twelve-months ' progress , with all sorts of lines and spots and frontiers marked on them , each with its fascinating tale of valor or industry to tell . And yet , this advance which seems as inevitable as the march of a Roman legion , meets every now and then with sharp and compelling vicissitudes . Out of the clear sky of this Africa there rises , as suddenly as the simoon , a cloud no bigger than a man 's hand , and swiftly it threatens to overwhelm and to ruin all ! WHERE YOUNG FRENCHMEN FIND OPPORTUNITY FOR ADVENTURE The history of Morocco is one of violent unrest and order in continual balance . I should like to tell that story and its implications over the last twenty years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke the power of Spain in Africa and went near to reconquering Morocco from the French . the Tricolor now blows beside the flag of the Sultan over nearly all of French Morocco : but not quite . There are regions in Great Atlas where die-hards still maintain their  | freedom , delivering shrewd blows at their conqueror from time to time ; and in the desert spaces of Sahara , horsemen and cameleers who ride acknowledging no lord . It is these gentlemen who keep France busy , and offer her young men opportunities of advancement and adventure , beyond that borderland known as the Zone of Security . I can imagine ? for I have felt it myself ? the attraction of such a life for a man grown tired of his boulevards and the charms of an overripe civilization : but it is closely sealed . No traveler may enter it without a strict permission , and there are places where even a French permit does not run . It is not very difficult to have your throat cut if you cross that line . The rekkas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , frequently endure that fate . Nameless , unknown , they perish , leaving no ripple behind then . But the sands of this colored and attractive life are running out , and short of another European war or some violent uprising in Asia , the triumph of France seems assured . None the less , these last pages of her story remain romantic enough ; telling a tale of policy and arms , fanaticism and pride ; of resistance , surrender , and swift revolt , that await a scribe . But France in Morocco has not produced her Kipling . I doubt if she ever will . One great traveler she has produced , the Vicomte de Foucauld and one administrator of genius , the Marechal Lyautey , grown white-haired and old in the service of France . A PANORAMA OP THOSE WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE ADVENTURE All kinds of people have taken a hand in this adventure ; crafty and ambitious chieftains and fighting prophets ; smooth diplomatists and hard-hitting commanders of the Foreign Legion ; Christians , Infidels , and Jews ; generals as lean as their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a life in the Sahara , friends in their youth of De Foucauld and Laperrine ; realists yet mystics like the people of the desert themselves , and quite the best kind of man you can hope to meet in northern  | Africa ; meharists of the camel corps who swagger about in their vast white pantalons ; flight commanders who cross the Atlas , dropping bombs upon the gathering tribes , and making new maps from the air ; royal princes with an urge for adventure ; drummers and army contractors out for pelf ; ladies of high rank and great virtue , and ladies of , many charms who possess neither ; innkeepers and cantiniers ; French children who become the attached companions of retired die-hards ; drivers of armored cars and lorries sprung from half the nations of Europe , with weird personal histories , and a knack of extricating themselves from every adventure , or dying game ; literary gentlemen whose home is in Paris and whose public resides in France ; missions-scientifiques ; hydrologists ; Deputies of the French Republic , shepherded in flights ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names : the Resident General of Morocco himself , carefully guarded and surrounded with pomp and ceremonial observance and something like 30,000 legionnaires ( mostly Germans ) who , having no country of their own , fight for that strange thing ? the Honor of the Legion ? and do the work of France for a few cents a day ; Ishmaelites all . Hail Caesar ! Upon the other side , and almost as quixotic , is their friend the Dissident , who provides the occasion and the battle ground for all this adventure ; a queer chap , with an odd love of freedom and of his native hills ; a bit of a troubadour ; somewhat of a patriot and fighter for the Faith ; gallant . truculent , treacherous , and cruel ; but always very much of a man , with a keen sense  | of humor allied with a strict attention to business . Awhile ago he raised a laugh throughout Morocco by stealing two carefree gentlemen of the Resident General 's household with their respective ladies ; and returning them , a little damaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the very latest design , with all recent improvements , duly specified . The Berbers , to whose category he belongs , have always been " agin " whatever government there has been in the land ; willing , as gentlemen , to follow any great leader to plunder and war ; unwilling to follow anyone for long ; the real nucleus of the Moslem armies who conquered Spain , and near of kin to those who marched across the Alps with Hannibal to the walls of Rome . The name of Hannibal is still , I am told , to be found among them . During the World War they furnished battalions whose record of valor was of the highest quality , irresistible in attack ; and it is with them that F'ran'ce must make her account . She will probably end by assimilating them , for she has a great gift that way , and the Berber has a European mind ; but ? there is the question of religion . THE ROUTE IMPERIALE These , then , are the people , and this the kind of region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To know them at all you have to penetrate the Atlas ; cross it , and travel into the desert regions beyond , where they become lost in the immensity of that half-known world we call the Sahara . There are several ways across ; some in the keeping of Berber lords and chieftains  | who hold or have held baronial sway in the mountain passes ; others in those of confederate tribes , loosely knit together in republican communities , continually in flux , and perpetually at war . Three of these ways I have frequented in the last two years , but this is the story of one ? the Route Imperiale . It runs , this highway as old as time and new as yesterday , from Meknes. the capital of Moulay Ismail , the Louis Quatorze of Morocco ( in whose clays King Charles II and Samuel Pepys , between them , gave up their English hold on Morocco , so changing the destiny of this world ) , across the Middle and the Grand Atlas , and the valley of the Moulouya River , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oases of Tafilalet , the cradle of the present dynasty of Morocco , and the bourne of all ambitious travelers to Morocco ( see map , page 266 ) .  | It is open to everyone now as far as Azrou , in the Middle Atlas , famous in the early years of the Protectorate as an advanced outpost of France , but now becoming a civilian place ; of little inns , and a market place the haunt of trading Jews and proud swaggering clansmen of the Beni Mguild , whose flocks and herds and 8,000 tents may be seen upon the pasture lands to the high waters of the Moulouya . These , who once carried the Almoravides to power , and furnished their contingents for the invasion of Spain , are now fast settling down to ways of peace ; but in the cedar forests there is still need for watch and ward . As my car runs through in the daylight hours , Berber sentinels stand with their rifles laid beside them in the forest , their belts full of cartridges ready for use . At night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The forest ends ; an upland world of old volcanoes and mountain tarns and hillsides white with snow takes its place . The snow lingers here into these early days of spring , in splashes which make tiger patterns on the hills . Ages have gone by since these volcanoes broke the quiet of this world ; but the rents through which the red lava flowed , and the projectiles flung from their bowels , still relate that tale . TIMHADIT POST CROWNS THE RIM OF A CRATER At Timhadit , a military post renowned in the story of France and Morocco , crowns in the most dashing manner the rim of an extinct volcano , 6,000 feet above sea level . Its once-fiery crater is buried in winter under heavy falls of snow , which isolate this outpost and block the highway . Skis are then the fashion . Eighteen miles away in the Berber hills , at a height of 9,000 feet , is the fortress of Bekrit , often isolated in the past and cut off from the rest of Morocco , save when relieving columns could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could stay to tell the reader that romantic tale of frontier valor and feats of arms , worthy of the pen of a Washington Irving . But here am I now in a wild borderland through which the  | Guigo River winds between walls of black basalt and lava , on its way to the fardistant civilized city of Fes ; while above it , dominating its life , is the fortress , perched like an eagle 's nest upon the summit of cliffs whose walls drop sheer 2,000 feet to the river 's edge . This stream has run in its day with blood and fire ; yet in its quiet hours it flows a clear blue water that might pass for a little English stream . Scenes of a luminous beauty now captivate my eyes where the Lake of Sidi Ali reflects in its tranquil surface the image of the sky . Flocks of Berber sheep graze here beside it in the care of lonely shepherds ; and colonies of storks reflect their black and white wings as they feed in its shallows , or make wide circles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its cone still littered with the missiles once flung from its vent . The mountains that inclose it are bright with the retreating snow . Here , in this lovely spot , destined to become before long one of the pleasure haunts of Morocco , there is no house or habitation , but only an outpost of the Foreign Legion ; rude and threatening with its barbed wire and guns . and heavily blockaded in winter by the snows . I spend the night here at the invitation of the young officer in command , and it becomes bitter cold as we sit over his wood fire and he tells me of his life . and of his friends " the enemy , " and of t h e legionnaires h e loves , though he rules them with a rod of iron . His little German corporal take ; photographs with an.expensive camera and when I cross the shallows takes me over on his back ! " What brought you here ? " I inquired . " A love affair , " says he . SCENES FROM NAPOLEONIC DAYS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " there comes , as I wait , the Resident General and High Commissioner of France with a sudden flare and entry ; his staff of General officers , an escort of Spahis in scarlet , and Berber Mokhazni cavalry in blue cloaks , decorated with rows of medals won in the World War , the testimony of valor . The horsemen of the tribes assembled to meet the Resident , close their ranks and charge , firing their muskets into the air and  | raising their war cries ; last remnants of an age of chivalry that is passing from our midst . At the head of them , and in advance of their own chieftains , rides an old French officer ; erect in his saddle , his sword at t h e salute . The stars and medals on his breast speak of many a battle and combat . A hundred years have altered much in France ; but behind the facade of our times , many a Baron de Marmot , matey a soldier of the Old Guard , lives on ; and sometimes I wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! This place , so silent and quiet yesterday , is now transformed into an assemblage of all the notables of the hills . The black-andwhite Berber tents are pitched in order on the plain ; and scores of horsemen are now galloping about , their little barbs prancing with pride and excitement , the sun shining upon their saddlecloths of crimson and green and gold , their long muskets enriched with circlets and bands of silver and ivory ; their women clad in bright colors , beating their castanets , crying out their " You-yous , " after the manner of the classic Greeks ; and dancing with slow ritual the ancient dances of the Berber clans . BERBERS ARE WHITE-SKINNED A white-skinned people , no one really knows their origin . The men are lean and swift in action ; the women often beautiful with their dark antimonied eves and slender painted fingers ; the children charming . Fierce and turbulent , the Berber is a mangay and spendthrift of his life . A banquet is prepared in the great tent of the chieftain of Timhadit , with carpets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of silk and velvet embroidered with gold for his guests to recline on . The roast meats , that have been cooking in the sun on brushwood fires , are brought in in procession , raised high on skewers like spears , and placed upon the floor ; while the chieftain 's sons with a polished courtesy wait upon his guests . A scene from the Middle Ages ! From under the rim of the tent , as we lie at ease , we look upon the beauty of the blue waters of the lake and the snow upon  | the hills beyond . A few years more and all this life will have passed away . THE HOT BREATH Or THE DESERT IS Now FELT The Imperial Road , soon to become one of the great arteries of northern Africa , now enters a forest of cedars , through whose dark avenues and swaying boughs there is disclosed , like a sudden apparition , the long and glittering array of the highest peaks of the Atlas , strung in a line upon the horizon . Ten thousand feet below those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Moulouya River takes its way to sea , to old Spanish presidios of 450 years ago . This is one of the great inspiring views of Morocco . The half-finished road on which I am traveling now drops swiftly past the fortress of Itzer to the Moulouya , whose passage no traveler familiar with this land can make without emotion , for it is one of the great dividing places of its history . Here now is a region utterly unlike that we have traversed from the Atlantic ; a desiccated , waterless land , through which the river , replenished in summer by the Atlas snows , flows , a stranger . The geography of this valley is written for the eye to see , in the steppes through which the river has burrowed its way , invisible in places , to its present level . From its banks steep pyramids and tables rise , whose nakedness reveals the long story of a dying and denuded world ; and though Grand Atlas ahead of us is still a barrier , I feel already the hot breath and thirsty mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illuminated and transformed into magical waves of color at the rising and setting of the sun . There are regions in Persia , in Colorado , and in Texas which are its near of kin . And yet afar off , upon the horizon , a snow-laden peak 10,000 feet high glitters like an iceberg above a heat-ridden world . THE ROAD TO TAFILALET French enterprise , persistence , and valor have made our swift journey possible so far , and I reflect that only once before in the history of this land has the Atlas been crossed by a European army ? when a Roman legion marched from the city of Volubilis , whose ruins subsist , to impress upon the ancestors of the Berbers the invincible might of Rome . But we are not yet across the Grand Atlas . His highest peak confronts us , a mighty barrier ; and none may travel on the new road to Tafilalet , that ancient mysterious and forbidden region of oases , without military sanction . Yet is it an old road , frequented through the ages and at the hazard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dates and Morocco leather of Tafilalet , the gold dust and ostrich plumes of Timbuctoo ; the other with corn and oil and the necessaries and marvels of the West . All the early romance of trade and barter is here , and many men have ( lied for it . Armies and great princes have gone this way to conquest ; while from the hungry south , the Puritans of Islam have come up like locusts in their flight , to purge the luxurious cities of their wealth , to seize at the points of their swords all that desert hearts can covet , and , themselves to perish at last of the faults they set out to redeem . We are arrived here at an epochal moment , when the great tide is flowing from west to east , escorted by the trumpets and battalions , the machine guns and the airplanes of France . The history of the future is being written here , and the epic adventure is entering upon its last phase . Soon , it may be , all this country will he open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( SEE PAGES 294 , 295 ) Crossing by high passes and wide and desolate valleys , imprisoned within successive chains of hills and defended by new fortresses and guns ? themselves liable to sudden annihilation at the hands of the insurgent clans -- the New Road takes its way , invincibly , to the broad valley of the Ziz . Fated never to reach the sea , that river will yet , before it perishes in the desert sands , make fruitful lands that could not otherwise live . Like all else in Morocco , it is a creature of strange and violent contrasts . The rude hills that inclose it are hare and stern , their massive forms look as though they would defy time itself . Yet on a near approach are they manifestly worn and graven with the fingers of decay . Deep gashes line and furrow their sides . Wind and rain and earth convulsion make of them a battle ground . And yet again , wherever the river flows , it is accompanied by fortified villages and aspiring towers , the homes of republican  | communities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their persons the secular and the spiritual life , have a finger in every pie , and use their influence , as it suits them , in favor of peace or war . In times of national excitement they become a focus of revolt . Canals and irrigation channels , the outcome of millenniums of experience , take off from the river and nourish their cornfields and their orchards , as they flow past their high and battlemented walls . Seen from afar off , with the hard African sunlight flaming on their yellow towers , these skyscrapers of the desert present the picture of a fantastic age . But the world that seethes within them scarcely bears out that impression . There is no candor and no beauty there . They inclose a world of dilapidation ; of dark and low-browed passages like tunnels , which break the fierceness of the summer sun and are inspired by a manifest fear and the love of secrecy . In one corner you will find there , stables and rooms almost impenetrable to light , in the next a house of prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplied with all the ceremonial requirements of worship ; a Holy of Holies that looks toward Mecca , a place of ablution , a minaret from which the Imam can call his faithful to prayer . For the Moslem , whether he worship in Alhambra or on his knees in the desert sand , never wavers in one jot or tittle from the ritual of his forefathers . The Kaid , or chieftain of the village , has a house ; it may be taller and better than those of his neighbors , with a ceremonial chamber laid with colored rugs , in which he receives his guests with the formal hospitality of centuries of usage . Here , in this part of the valley , at Mzizel , and in the company of a young French officer who exercises a diplomatic and military control over the region , I have spent many fine mornings riding out with an escort of cavalry to these fortified places . and sharing with him the ritual of salutation and the hospitality of stately and interesting personages . But travelers who came here be- fore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would not be safe to come here alone . THE F'OUM KHENEG , OR GREAT GORGE OT THE ZIZ The river , which is now our guide , takes its way , bountiful and gladdening to the hearts of men ; until at Kerandou we reach a crisis in its life , and in our own small business of travel . For till now , keeping strictly to the road , we have been permitted to travel unaccompanied , if we chose ; , but from here on no one may go except with a caravan protected by armored cars and outflanking parties of the friendly tribes ; and this once only in every ten days . The narrow passage of the Foum Kheneg lies ahead ; the river writhing and twisting and doubling on itself like some cosmic python caught in its iron grip . Into this strangling place , renowned in the history of the land , the new road enters and becomes engaged like the river , in a fierce struggle with the last barriers of the Atlas , before it can emerge upon the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ziz ; but none more surprisingly beautiful than here where it is lost in a succession of palm groves and orchards and cornfields ; enameled in the heart and secrecy of tragic cliffs whose gaunt forms are worn into fantastic lines , blood-red , yellow , gray , purple , and mauve , by ages of its toil and eons of despair ; the landmarks of a dying world . Along this rift that the river has made through incalculable years , are strung some twenty miles of castles , fortresses , strongholds , villages ; the evident children of jealousy and fear ; and each a law unto itself , till now . No traveler ? and many making history have marched this way ? has ever come through without the sanction , enforced or granted , of these Guardians of the Pass . But the river , which is the oldest traveler of all , pursues its course , asking no man 's leave ; and the beauty of its verdure , of its wild battlements whose every sierra , starkly engraved upon the sky , is now commanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers one of the strangest and most affecting contrasts in the world . For Nature and man are equally violent here ; yet the palm fronds in their millions sway in the breeze . the petals of the roses , and the bloom upon the almond trees , fall to the ground ; and the pale turquoise river flows on , past them all , to its death in the desert sands . ARMORED CARS DASH THROUGH THE DEFILE Through this defile our armored cars bristling with machine guns , the heavy camions that have killed the old caravans , and a score of other vehicles , grind and squeal and rage upon the half-finished road ; taking their way in hurricane clouds , half-stifling their inmates , and covering the trembling cars of corn , the scarlet lips of the pomegranate flowers , with an impalpable dust that one day will consume them all . The great defile ends at last near the fortress and market town of Ksar es Souk ( see page 295 ) ; and every one feels a sense of relief at escaping from its toils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usage , relax from their labors and start telling tales of their experiences . " Six times , " says one , " I have been fired at in coming through . Once I had a French colonel beside me in the front scat . His head drooped over my wheel and I said to myself , The Colonel has fallen asleep . ' But when I touched him I saw that the was dead . One can hear nothing on this brute of a road . Another time it was a case of a soldier of the Legion who deserted . He got away ; but the Partisans , warned to keep a sharp lookout for him , saw him leaping about like a hare among the rocks trying to escape . He would n't listen to them , so they shot him . What else could they do ? His grave is at the next post . Who was he ? Ion Dieu ! Who knows what anybody is in the Legion ? " The Hammada now lies before us , a steppe featureless as the Australian Desert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lorries , restricted till now to a single line , scatter like boys released from school and race each other : the armored cars , fore-and-aft , catch the general infection ; their yellow towers glowing in the sun , the wicked-looking muzzles of their guns thrust out against the sky . Everybody now makes all the noise he can ; everyone is glad of relief from the Pheneg . Ten miles of this joyous racing bring- us to the fort of Meski , behind whose walls the cliffs drop sheer to the Ziz , which we had forgotten , stealing on its way through palm oases , unseen , unheard . The place is of a surprising beauty : and at the river 's edge where cavalrymen and Legionnaires go down to water their horses , there is a spring that makes a pool at the mouth of the limestone cavern from which it issues . This clear blue water is sacred . and throughout the ages it has charmed and touched the hearts of men . For this . and because twenty thousand tribesmen here gave battle to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost to sight and mind . till upon a sudden the cars racing over the waterless plain turn sharply aside , and disclose its chasm and its flood , winding in lazy coils between palm oases at the foot of towersyand battlements and fortified homes , overshadowed by its giant cliffs . The river has worn its way to that farclown level as if seeking oblivion . We cross it ; the track descending in dangerous diagonals the cliffs , where a tributary canyon offers an approach . This place . still guarded by a pair of guns , has been for generations the haunt of throat-cutters and bandits who took toll of the slowmoving caravans . We pull up at the fortress of Aoufous. clamped against a cliff ; its inclosing walls and its houses in tier below tier , gleaming through the fronds of the palm trees by the river . By its banks the pomegranates shed their scarlet bloom , the corn blades whisper together : an oriole Clashes his golden wings : and water , taken in a hundred little channels , fertilizes the soil . Nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aloof . and violent : yet is she diversified at times with flowers and birds and butterflies on the wing . The men who live here take color from their surroundings . They are treacherous and arrogant , the strong- bullying the weak . They are cruel and oppressive and full of guile , yet faithful to their own ideals ; kneeling humbly at the hours of prayer to worship their God ; their Jehovah , or Allah , the Compassionate , the Merciful , the Just . In the shadows of the palm trees , under the bright stars that move , they proclaim  | their loves in melancholy songs ; attain their heart 's desire , and soften toward the children of their loins . Death continually intervenes in their lives ; battle and murder and pestilence ; the sudden hammer strokes of Fate ; of that Kismet whose mystic power holds them in its grasp and assuages their vain regrets . Our convoy is racing now once more across the oases and the desert places , till upon the skyline , like the ram of a ship of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tafilalet , menacing in its impact against the sky . It is the master of this world : for it commands the long lines of oases , watered by the " Liz and the Gheris , which here uniting have sustained through centuries of turmoil and unrest a population of two hundred thousand souls , and myriads of date palms ? a metropolis of the Sahara . The waters spread out in a wide network of channels , giving life to a world that without them would be ( lead ; and though the desert that encircles them be empty , here under the palm trees and in the interiors of the fortified ksour ( villages ) , there is assembled a community of men seething with life and passion . THE HIDDEN WORLD OF ' THE " " KSOUR " " Hardly anybody knows what goes on there . The ksour are the meeting places of caravans , of plotters and die-hards from the desert and the hills : of emissaries from far-off sanctuaries who wish no good to the Christian invader ; of raiders who lay their plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert , or some peaceful trader whose only desire is to pass unseen ; of chieftains with a lust for power , subtle and politic , waiting upon events ; of men of the Sword and men of the Book ; divines learned in the traditions of the Prophet ; fighters to whom there is no field of flowers like a battle field ; Jews who have borne through centuries every species of indignity , and now wait for the coming of another race , their passport to freedom , prosperity , and power : princes of the blood royal of Morocco , living out their lives in exile , far from the court : spies and informers : slaves in whose murky eyes there is no illusion of any coming fortune ; women with veiled faces secreted behind high  | walls ; women who toil like beasts of burden in the sun ; and women , " the daughters of joy , " who sing and adorn themselves for the warrior fresh from his fight and the trader with his new-gotten wealth . All this life , secret or open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortress of Erfoud , whose guns of the World War look hungrily across the oases , and at command could fling dismay and ruin into that ant heap of men ; reducing it to the shambles to which Sidjilmassa , that famous city that once flowered here in the desert , fell . But the guns are silent , and for yet a season Tafilalet remains a closed book . We may not enter there . Indeed , so near are we to " insecurity " now , that even in the lower town , within the walls of the new French settlement , none may venture to go beyond them after dark ; and the withdrawal of these guns might mean a massacre . This new town of Erfoud is built on the banks of our river , to which at sunrise and at dark the Jewesses go down to fill their waterpots . They are unlike any others of their race in Morocco , and look as if they had been left over here from some lost world , which is probably true . They are robed in scarlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry a small cushion on their heads under a red-and-yellow veil which flows down upon their shoulders ( see page 296 ) . The older women have grave , handsome faces ; the younger ones , with their dark eyes and amber skins , are of considerable beauty ; and they go laughing to the river , where they stand up to their knees in its clear waters to fill their ancient pots . The scene is one for a painter ; overlooked by the red cliffs of the fortress , and burnished by the gold of the sun . The head of their community is the Jew David , whose warehouses multiply and whose wealth increases daily . His agents and his emissaries are everywhere . For there is  | no door so firmly closed in Morocco that a Jew , however persecuted , can not enter . II LORDS OR THE ATLAS AND THEIR CASTLES Morocco , with a population three-fourths of that of New York City , can boast of more fortified cities and castles than the whole of the United States and Canada . The statistic is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which " the last enchantments of the Middle Ages " mingle with a primitive barbaric violence , and the mechanical paraphernalia of our current civilization . I take no sides in this matter . A man can be willing to fight another , or fly at a hundred miles an hour , without losing his sense of beauty or his love of the undeniable charm of an old world that is passing away ; and nowhere are these varied interests better served t h a n in Mo rocco , and in the terri tories of its highland chieftains and Berber lords , known as the Grand Kaids . The chieftain who by dint of a certain family aptitude for combining diplomacy with valor , a n d because he h o t c1 s the most important of the Atlas passes , is the Glaoui , Pasha of Mar rakech and Lord of Telouet . The hisotry of the rise the of this family to a front place in Morocco is interesting , but too long for me to tell it here . I will say only that as Pasha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has made the pilgrimage to Mecca ) Thami El Glaoui lives in an oriental palace compounded o f Alhanmbra and the Ara bian nights , with veiled gardens within its high walls , full of orange trees and scented flowers , and musical with the murmur of his plashing fountains and the songs of wild birds in sanctuary there . Inaccessible when his guarded door is closed , impenetrable behind his velvetmask , he is yet as subtly aware of the balance of power in Europe and the things of this world as any Florentine prince of the Ren aissance . No one can be more polite , no one more cruel ; and yet he has brokers in Paris and in London and he plays golf ! Frail and delicate to look at , he has led his contingents to battle with a reckless p 300 disregard o f consequences , while his official duties at Marrakech , and his other affinities keep him constantly in the city . STRANGE SECRETS OF ' A FORMIDABLE , CASTLE He seldom visits now his ancestral castle of Telouet , set in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade routes of Africa , between the Atlantic and the Sahara . He leaves his dignity there to b e sustained by h i s nephew , Si Hammou , a typical white Berber , whom men call " The Eagle of Telouet . " Of what goes on in the intimacies of that strange and formidable place , only a few have knowledge . For Si Hammou is master there in a world of his own ; of men , women , and children ; of wives a n d concubines ; o f slaves a n d freemen , cattle and horses , camels and motor cars ; of subservient Jews and proud clansmen who swagger about in the distinctive robe of the Glaoui , with a cinnamon or scarlet sun woven upon its black background of goats ' hair ; of embrasured walls and cloud-capped towers : of dungeons and dark places secreted from the light of day , in which a man visited with his displeasure may linger and die unseen ; of chambers adorned with silks of luxury and carpets woven on his looms , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , look out upon his Atlas snows , and orchards innocent with the springtime bloom . I was received by Si Hammou at Telouet upon a letter from The Glaoui , and was offered by him accommodation for a night in the castle ; but it was the period of Ramadan , when men are weak from fasting , and , for t1ns and other reasons , I preferred the more kindly hospitality of the French outpost , whose little finger is stronger now than all the towers and walls of The Glaoui . Si Hammou , however , after the patriarchal manner of a Berber chieftain , sent across to me there a complete dinner of baked meats and couscous , carried in fourteen covered baskets upon the heads of a rhythmic procession of his slaves ; together with the gift of a carpet from his looms , which now lies under my writing table .  | These hospitalities were due entirely to a recommendation from Marshal Lyautey , the most loyal and generous of friends ; to whom , and to many a French officer in these distant regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it hard to repay . EXOTIC CASTLES RISE ALONG TILL DRAA The Glaoui lordship extends over a vast area that here follows the streams that descend from Atlas to Sahara , changing their names continually , until they merge at last in the Draa , whose fate it is to perish before it reaches the salt waters of the sea . It is along the multiple course of this river and its affluents , that men who away from it would perish and ( lie , live at ease in their rich oases ; multiplying their children , their flocks and their herds ; and building for themselves the strange exotic castles and kasbas that are to be found only in this region of Morocco . These Babylonian mansions that contain in them I know not what reminiscence of Egypt and the Equator , are built of river bowlders and hammered earth and lime . Long concealed behind the Atlas . they are now coming to be known beyond its limits ; but few travelers are yet permitted to look upon them , the country in which they are secreted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where another scion of the Glaoui family holds sway , there is a whole series of them along both banks of that desert stream , still ice-cold from the Atlas snows ( see page 316 ) . It is impossible here for me to describe their fantasies ; to relate their human story or to convey the conviction that overtakes me when I am there , of having fallen upon a strange and other world : African , violent , and barbaric , yet of a singular refinement and of a romantic beauty . Nor may I dwell upon the feeling that assails me when I leave them , that they are doomed to vanish and to pass away . I know in a sense that already have I come here too late ; for had my traveler 's fortune brought me to Morocco but twenty years ago , or less , I might have ridden like some other men I know , with the Harkas of Glaoui , and witnessed a society then in its prime . There is no permanency here . These people are nomads at heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglect suffice to bring even the loftiest and the most embattled of these towers down to the earth from which they were taken . Nor as the French peace advances is there likely to be much longer need for them to continue . But a few years ago the last of the great sultans of Morocco passed by here , worn with the stress of his life and the toils of this his last journey , though he knew it not . He was accompanied by his little son , Abdul Aziz , in whose short reign the old Morocco was to expire ; and when they reached the Glaoui Pass at Telouet , in the cold and the snow , it was , for all the royal standards and customary state of the Commander of the Faithful , just touch and go whether the Glaoui of the day would welcome his master or entrap him . He chose the loyal course , went out to meet him with his men and the kindly succor that all men need after a long and harassing journey . The Sultan was received into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunes of the Glaoui were made . It is a story that is part of the drama of Moorish history and it is well known ; but I have heard it from the lips of the Sultau , Abdul Aziz himself . It is impossible for me to forget it here . THE OASIS OF OUARZAZAT At Ouarzazat , where I arrived late one night in a camion whose brakes were in a perilous way . by the new road that was still unfinished and without a parapet . I was taken into their house by the Political Officer and his wi fe. and made a member of the mess of the Fourth Foreign Legion . In the company of its officers , or alone with a Mokhazni , whose medals spoke of his share in the war , I rode about in the valley ; visiting the chain of its kasbas , each , as it seemed to me. more attractive than the last . At one of these an Italian corporal of the Legion got on behind me , for there was no other horse just then , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a pair of Andalusians on their way to a fair . At Ait Ben Abhou as the lovely evening closed in. and the storks feeding in the green cornfields took wing and flew home to their nests on the high towers of his castle , I saw the sheik descending from it in his Glaoui robe , with its crimson sun inscribed upon it ( they say it is not a sun at all . but a memory of the slash a Glaoui got across his loins in battle ) ; and followed by his slaves , carrying the evening meal , of which presently he and I and the corporal partook together . At Skoura , upon the fringes of " security . " there is a whole colony of these  | kasbas in an oasis through which the river flows in a hundred canals and rivulets . The pathways in this human maze twist and turn interminably , crossing each narrow water by a humpback bridge ( usually with a hole in it where the keystone has become dislodged ) , now in graceful curves that wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose bloom falls in a shower as we hit them in passing ; now at a sharp right angle under the walls of a projecting house ; or , unexpectedly , across the wide stony waste of the central stream . " THE LEGION A PURGATORY , NOT A HEEL " As time pressed , for we had a long way to go before dark , and The Glaoui 's brother had detained us with his hospitalities , his son , mounted on a fiery little barb , went off at a breakneck speed , leaving us to follow him through this fantastic maze . We had no option , for horses following in such conditions will not be staved . Night came down upon us in the desert , with a red sunset that transfigured a cruel and beautiful world ; across which a little gazelle , with a cotton-white patch at her tail , went twinkling like light over a chaos of stones with a grace that no other creature can rival . " Yes ! " said our colonel at mess , reflectively sipping his wine , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our poor Lieutenant M came clown in one the other day . I sent him across the Atlas by airplane to the hospital at Marrakech , where he is lying now with a broken hack . Not much hope for him , I am afraid . " This fiery little colonel is one of the jolliest chaps I have met in Morocco ; with thirty years of Africa and the Legion behind him . he is hard as nails ; and though stern upon occasion , of an exuberant gaiety , with a reputation for being good to his men . " What I say , Monsieur O'Connor , to those who run us down , is this : the Legion is a purgatory , not a hell . " A man who wishes to purge himself of his sins and make good can always do so under my command . " And that , if you allow for Africa and the cafard , seems to be the truth about the Legion . Returning from Ouarzazat. where I had occasion to meet Pelletier d'Oisv , the French airman , fresh from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make maps and photographs of the desert oases beyond the border , I visited the Kasba of Ounila , within a ride of Telouet . It owes its peculiar charm to the purity of its style ; its red walls , with their yellow towers and loopholes and African embellishments , making a perfect picture in the middle of the barren and snow-clad hills . The clear blue stream of the Ounila flows round it , watering its cornfields and orchards and the roots of its magnificent old walnut trees . The Khalifa , unlike the old Eagle of Telouet , is known for his kindly and welcoming manners ; and his people take after him . Jacques Majorelle , the onlv French painter who has been allowed in this Atlas , has made more than one beautiful picture of this kasba , now safely stored away in private collections in New York ; and my only regret has been , and is , that in the course of these travels I have not had a painter of talent for my companion . An opportunity awaits the right man here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARISTOCRAT 'S IN AN EPHEMERAL LAND I have confined myself so far to the territories of The Glaoui beyond the Atlas . But there are other lords whose ancestors , like his , seized the passes through their country , and levied a toll upon the lives and possessions of all who went by . Two of these , the Goundafi ( page 304 ) and the Mtougui , still hold the trade routes between Morocco proper and the rich valley of the Sous , long coveted by German political emissaries and seekers after business . and a proximate cause of the World Var . Both the old chieftains , who had been making history when the French came in , are dead ; their successors , feeble and ineffective , have lost much of their power , and they tend to disappear . I retain a recollection of seeing the old Mtougui riding on his way to court at Marrakech , supported in the saddle on each side of his stooping figure for he was stricken with age ? by the hands of willing retainers . A pure Berher of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of I , ochiel or Campbell of Argyll , had held their place in the mountains for two hundred years ; the only real aristocrats in a land ephemeral and continually changing . The present Goundafi lives in privacy in Marrakech . But a car carried me up in a couple of hours to his foothills at Tinmal. where the famous dynasty of the Almohades , whose standards once flew over  | Spain , rose to greatness from small beginnings ; and there the Goundafi , abandoning his eyrie in the mountains , has built himself a small Eastern palace by the waters of the River Nfis . His old castle at Talaat n'Yakoub commanding the lower valleys , and still the image of a feudal keep , is now all but abandoned . Every European traveler in earlier days has recorded its inhospitality . It was in the palace of to-day that I passed my first night as the guest of his Khalifa , and listened in the hours of wakefulness to his fountains plashing in the marble court , as the moon came and went and the scent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HORSEBACK ACROSS THE ATLAS A clay 's ride on horseback , accompanied by a Mokhazni in his long blue military cloak , brought me to the old fierce castle on its hill at a height of 5,000 feet ; once the terror of rebellious vassals as of all wayfaring men , but now given up to negro slaves and ancient retainers , who would not open the great door of the castle until assured that I had a permit , and even then reluctantly . Its courtyard was crowded with camels and horses , and swarms of black children with their mothers , the bond slaves of their lord . The great aqueduct that once nourished the castle , has ceased to flow , and clearly the days of this haughty old place are numbered . I spent the night in the village under the shade of its century-old walnut trees , the haunt of wayfaring men ; but in the house of a man who , though I had no introduction to him , received me with the greatest kindness and proved himself to be a scholar and a gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he laid with richly colored rugs ; and he gave me green china tea perfumed with fresh mint from his garden . The evening meal also he had served there , at my request , when day came to an end and the stars were bright in the sky ; while my soldier who had been in France with the Moorish battalions helped me to carry on a conversation that revealed his cultivated mind . A stranger I came and a stranger I left ; yet the memory of his unforced hospitality remains fresh in my mind . Ahead of us now lay the Col of Tizi N Test , 6,100 feet in height and flanked by the snow-white crests of the Atlas ; the horses climbing continually , and few travelers on the road , until it so narrowed that it became but a sword-cleft in the mountains , in which a handful of brave men might well have defied an army . Dangerous it was in the days now fleeting , when travelers marching here were at the mercy of its lord ; dangerous it is still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meadows deep in turf , the grazing lands in summer of the clan ; and white patches of snow that made a dazzling pattern in the ilex woods . I had been warned by the General commanding at Marrakech that the season was too early for travel , and that a snowstorm in the pass might overtake me and compel me to return . I was rewarded as I came to the end of the steep ascent , with one of the great views of Morocco . The entire valley of the Sous lay in the sunlight at my feet , under a curtain some thousands of feet above it , of gray drifting clouds whose ragged fringes came swarming over the barriers of the Anti-Atlas that separates this world from the Mauretanian Plains , like those Blue Men of the Litham ( Tuaregs ) who in the past swept here across their deserts and their barren hills to victory , and the purging of Islam . The clouds , as they came on , grew dark and thunderous , and the evening sky was lit with their fiery zigzags ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I drew near my lodging for the night , filled each river bed and bowlder-strewn ravine with a passionate torrent of mud and water , and threatened to make the road to Taroudant impracticable . I passed the night in good company , for the Sheiks of the neighboring tribes had come in to greet me . An ample dinner of chickens and couscous was served ; round which we all sat together and ate with our fingers ; the manners of my friends perfect , and free from reserve . For the Berber is a freeman , and of a temper which , though easily roused , is naturally gay and lighthearted . After the ceremony of mint tea was accomplished , fresh cushions were supplied , upon which all reclined ; while a deal chest with an enormous padlock was brought in and laid before one of the company , who with the conscious air of a proprietor produced an Ali-Baba key from under his waist belt and , raising its lid , disclosed a gramophone !  | Everyone was delighted , and as a compliment the loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guest . The tunes were Moorish tunes , and the nasal voice of the singer alternately soothed and excited the company . After I had borne with the loud speaker as long as politeness required , I turned it gently round to the ear of its proprietor . A twinkle of laughter ran round the circle , as the tables were turned upon him , and the evening closed in very cheerfully , though the rain ran down the walls of my chamber in little brown streams and splashed in the courtyard outside . The Mokhazni , who bore me company , respectful but equal , was careful at the appointed hours to rise and pray ; proclaiming in his sonorous voice the message of Islam , " God is but one God and Mohammed is the prophet of God " ; to which , since this was his country , I took no exception . The following day the sun shone out , and the people hung flowers from their mules and horses and the women cried out their " You-yous " of welcome ; for the rain had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after their eastern way , they attributed to my coming , a guest . Of Taroudant ( see page 292 ) , that walled city that is one of the gems of Morocco , and of Agadir , where the first tocsin of the World War was sounded , I have no room here to speak ; nor of the kasbas , that flank upon each side of the valley of the Sous ; nor of Tiznit , that frontier city whose drums still proclaim each morning the dignity of the Sultan ; nor of the hills beyond the Anti-Atlas , where as yet few are permitted to enter . For still there are tribesmen there who resist the advance of France , and prefer the hardships of the desert to all her blandishments . III I close with a reference to Khenifra ( pages 26S-9 ) , in the country of the Zaian , in the Middle Atlas , where the last of the great chieftains of Morocco rose to power with the suddenness of a thunderstorm . Aloha Ou Hammou was his name . He gave his daughter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well have seized the crown . For the Zaians were a formidable confederacy , and he was a great man , fierce and pitiless to those who withstood him . But he came too late in the history of his coijntry . The French occupation of Morocco had begun , and he would accept no compromise . He was killed in battle fighting against one of his sons who had gone over to the new power . I stayed in his castle in 1922 , and met there three of his sons ? big men with bushy black beards like Assyrian kings . One of these , Bou-Azza , the bravest of them all , riding fiercely ahead of the French battalions , was killed in charging his clansmen who had not yet submitted . Such is life in the Berber Hills .  |
