txt Can We Still Believe in God ? Fading Distinctions in Religious Thought The Natural and the Supernatural The Human and the Divine Is Human Nature Hopeless CHAPTER III GOD AND MAN IN HIGH RELIGION The Oxford Dictionary defines religion as : " Recognition on the part of man of some unseen higher power as having control of his destiny and as being entitled to obedience , reverence , and worship . " Notice the suggestion of two terms , God on the one hand , man on the other , with a two-way activity and relatedness between the two . Now the question for high religion becomes this : If it pushes its intellectual task with sufficient vigor , does it not eliminate the first term of our definition , " some unseen higher power , " leaving us without anything that can legitimately be called religion , or else forcing us to change the accepted meaning of the word in the directions indicated by humanism or naturalistic idealism ? Can high religion hold to God in any true sense ? By way of approaching an answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " God " and " man " ? of man or human nature no less than of God or divine nature ; for we have become hazy in our conceptions of both , so that our discussions of the religious problem are woefully confused . George Eliot speaks of " the right of the individual to general haziness . " Our first impulse is to concede that right to a generation so confused as our own , especially // in the area of religion . But it is the individual himself who refuses to rest content in the exercise of that right . He seems to think that eventually , at least , he has the right to general clearness . He begins to crave the clearcut distinctions of systematic thought for his religious faith . Unless these can be worked out with reasonable satisfaction , one can not go about the business of life with any assurance ; he is bereft of peace of mind and conscience ; he is robbed of the effective drive that accompanies intelligent convictions ; he is bemired and befogged in relativism . The religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this need for clearness of outline all the more imperative . It is in this area that the highest values known to us are at stake . We know that we shall stumble interminably unless we can work through to an ordered universe of fact and value . Nor does it seem an unreasonable demand that straight thinking should dispel the haziness of our mental atmosphere . Complicated as our living is , there surely must be some relief from permanently " thinking gray , " some hope of " thinking black and white . " For an increasing number of people there can be no return to the exact distinctions and definitions of religion which served their fathers . Looking back , it seems to us that their universe was neatly unscrambled . The edges of their religious conceptions were clear-cut . // They put opposites over against each other in pairs with plenty of space between them . They knew , for example , where the natural left off and the supernatural began . They fixed a well-defined gulf between the human and the divine and between man and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of staying put , so that one could find his way around even in the dark . One might go in the wrong direction , might choose to ignore the plain pathways to salvation , but he knew when he was doing this . But so much has happened to disarrange all this . The old cosmic home has been wrecked by burly intruders called new facts and new interpretations . If , therefore , we are to find a way out of our haziness , it must be by forging ahead to the creation of new distinctness of thought in religion based on the new world-view which is now ours . The task should not discourage us ; it should lure us as a major spiritual adventure . It might encourage us to reflect that , however orderly and discrete the religious thinking of the fathers may seem as we look back , they too had their problems of discarding outworn distinctions and finding new ones to take their places . It is true that there were periods , even centuries , of relative fixity . What has happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the close of such a period when many considerations have combined to make the older definitions and distinctions seem sud- // denly untenable . Black and white have merged too quickly for us ; we have fallen behind in the task of re-separation . It is not enough to understand how the older categories arose , or even to trace the " acids of modernity " which have eaten away their basis . What the modern man faces now is the more important quest for redefinitions which will bear the weight of today 's faith and today 's living . If we are to recapture meaning for the conception of man 's living his life with a conscious sense of fellowship with God , it is especially necessary to revise our thinking about two of the older distinctions , that between the natural and the supernatural , and that between the human and the divine . See then the modern man as he ponders the problem of the older distinction between the " natural " and the " supernatural . " He pictures the former two-story universe with the natural below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion to champion the reality and superiority of the supernatural order , while revealing the inadequacy and transitoriness of the natural order ; to maintain that at times the supernatural power , wisdom , or love of God might " invade " the natural order in unique acts of providence , judgment , or revelation . This was the heart of religion 's good news . If all this were not true , there would be no religion ; for its very // function was to show the way in which the gulf between the two separate spheres might be bridged . Thus it offered a supernatural Being , or a supernatural book , or a supernatural savior , or a supernatural grace for the saving of the soul . But what is one to think of all this in a day when evidence keeps mounting to invalidate that entire world-view ? For with the advance of scientific explanations of our universe , item after item of experience is being transferred from the upper-story of the supernatural to the lower-story of the natural . Happenings in nature once considered as direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural causes . Our commonest day is crowded with phenomena formerly referred to the supernatural but now understood in categories of the natural . As human understanding increases , will the term supernatural be entirely emptied of its content ? Is it then equivalent only to " the not-yet-understood ? " It is quite possible for one to come to this point and remain a religious man in the sense that he may still believe in God and feel himself working in conscious fellowship with the Divine , whom he identifies now , not with everything ( pantheism ) , not with all man does not yet understand ( supernaturalism ) , but with certain creative elements making for value throughout the whole . He will refuse to align himself with mate- // rialistic naturalism which denies the essentially spiritual nature of the cosmos . He will be aware that the mech-anistic ' philosophy of science " has been undermined by the findings of Bergson , Whitehead , Eddington , and Jeans . He can think of himself as a somewhat under-standing collaborator with the divine intelligence and purpose . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the view of Jesus transcended the categories of a super-natural order over against the natural , seeing instead a personal and moral immanence of God throughout the entire world-whole . As T. Rees says of Jesus ' thinking : " In such a system the antithesis of natural and super-natural could not arise , for with God all things are pos-sible and natural , and without Him nothing is pos-sible. " 1 What some might call miracles were to Jesus not violations of nature , not contrary to nature , not even above nature , but all a part of the divine operations through nature . Sickness is not a supernatural punish-ment for sin . Towers do not fall on men as special " acts of God . " The natural laws of rain and sunshine are not interfered with on behalf of the just or as dis-crimination against the unjust . Even the kingdom of God is amenable to the natural laws of organic growth ? THE NATURAL AND THE SUPERNATURAL But the early followers of Jesus were unable to maintain this viewpoint . Their own Jewish apocalyptic ex-pectations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-establish the two-story world-structure . By the time the Fourth Gospel was written , the doctrine of the " two worlds " was firmly entrenched ; while the book of Revelation , like all apocalyptic literature , set the natural and the supernatural in sharp contradistinc-tion , perpetuating this viewpoint in Christian thought even down to the present day . Bishop Berkeley , in the Eighteenth Century , again approximated the outlook of Jesus , though from a philosophical standpoint , when he viewed the world of nature as " the perpetual manifestation of the spiritual presence of God , " leaving no hiatus between natural and supernatural . It is interesting that after several centuries of the challenge of naturalism and material-ism we are returning to a scientific world-view which may make Berkeley 's idealism , somewhat modified , as in Josiah Royce , again respectable . As Alfred Noyes says : " Science now So strangely nears by its own arduous road , The idealist 's world . . . your atomists have dissolved Their old material solids ' into a mist Not so unlike the veil that Berkeley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would seem better to drop this opposition of the terms natural and supernatural , moving on to the conception of the world-whole as truly a uni-verse and not a " duo-verse . " But it is a universe which is only partially understood and controlled by man , including , indeed , phases of reality which may never be understood or controlled by man , though no bounds can be set as to how far man may go . To designate that which is be-yond man 's understanding or control , it is legitimate and convenient to use the terms , superhuman or tran-scendent . It is a universe in which intelligence and purpose were manifest long before man came on the scene . Some factor with the characteristics that we asso-ciate with personality is at work bringing into emer-gence or " concretion " a whole series of material things , living beings and spiritual forces . " To sum up the whole matter , " says the Professor of Zodlogy at Johns Hopkins University , ' " the study of biology leaves us with an impression of the universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented in the name of physics . The universe is a system that in time comes to life ; a system that be-comes conscious of itself ; a system that has feelings , ideas , interests , thoughts , knowledge , purposes . It brings forth living things , with their sensations , emotions , satisfacTHE NATURAL AND THE SUPERNATURAL tions , their knowledge and thought and ideals ; with their powers of action , of controlling what further oc-curs . This production of life and its attributes is one of the revelations of the essential nature of things ; something never to be forgotten in considering the properties of the elements of which the world is put together . In bringing forth life , the universe shows it-self a system that is not given complete , once for all ; a system that is not stereotyped in its action , not predict-able . " The universe thus conceived calls for no surrender of the deepest religious values . The universe , thus freshly understood , is marvellous and mysterious beyond one 's former dreams . It makes all the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work throughout its whole range , but with only partial suc-cess up to the present time . Man is encouraged to co-operate intelligently with this divine administration . It inspires him to wonder and awe ; it disciplines him in modesty and self-criticism ; it woos him on to fullness of life ; it challenges him to his highest ; and it sends him naturally to his knees in reverent worship of the Creator-Spirit . Professor Dewey 's contention that " a religion " is no longer possible , but only the " religious attitude , " be- // cause ra religion is bound to commit itself to the supernatural , loses its point in the light of the foregoing interpretations of high religion . Yet no one could describe our viewpoint here claimed for high religion as " naturalism " in the older sense . Both naturalism and supernaturalism are outmoded categories . Nor have we merely substituted a new heaven as over against a new earth . We have moved into a genuine universe . With this in mind we may now seek new light on the troublesome distinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " man and God . For our predecessors the difference between the two was clear enough . In the heaven of their faith was the Ancient of Days who sat enthroned in splendor . The divine nature was high , transcendent , " other . " On the earth below dwelt a lost and insignificant creature called man . Though man had been created in the spiritual image of God , the elements of divinity had all but perished in Adam 's fall , leaving a gulf between the divine nature in God and the human nature in man . The good news of this system was that divine grace had provided a way of bridging ? but not of abolishing ? this gulf , making possible intercommunication and fellowship between God and man . This restored to human nature something of worth and dignity , filled man with reverence and // humility , thrilled him with fear and hope , and spurred him with the sense of moral obligation . We need scarcely remind ourselves how this sharp distinction has faded for the modern mind . Advancing interpretations forced a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature . God was seen to be the Supreme Intelligence creating and unfolding through the cosmic processes , His highest expression being precisely in man ? man at his best . Man , then , instead of being depraved dust , became something quite superb . God and man became boon companions again . In fact they proceeded to merge into one , and religion flew out of the window , because there was no longer any meaning in the conception of fellowship between God and man . So religious humanism came on the scene , saying that since all that was meant by God was the best in human nature , it would be better to drop the term and the concept " God . " This is what Doctor Fosdick deplored as " religion without God " ? a contradiction in terms . The recent humanist movement arose at a time most inimical to its success ; for it was no sooner launched than man proceeded to make an unusually blundering debacle of his world , morally , economically , and politically . It is not a little difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the supposedly empty throne of God . 5a GOD AND MAN IN HIGH RELIGION All the while others were pointing out that the evidence of our reconstructed universe points definitely in the direction of the existence of God . But along comes Elmer Davis saying , " Yes , but not the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob ; only the God of Einstein and Spinoza ? a God so far off and so impersonal that man can claim very little knowledge about Him and no communication or fellowship with Him . So all we really have is God without religion : " He is right in assuming what the humanists overlooked , that by definition religion implies a sense of conscious fellowship with the Divine ; though he may not be so correct in assuming that Spinoza , " the God-intoxicated Jew , " and Einstein , with his " Cosmic Religion , " do not manifest such a sense of conscious fellowship . Out of this confusion can we work our way through to definitive conceptions of the human and the Divine without identifying the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without separating them so far apart as to make religious experience impossible ? We believe that we can , by some such pathway as the following . We may reasonably think of God as the Universe Personality , related to the cosmos somewhat as the essential ego in man is related to man 's body . As the ego ( soul , spirit , personality ) grew this body and is expressed through it , so God is the Spirit constantly // creating the universe and being expressed in it . As our personality is immanent in the body yet transcends its confines in a hundred ways , so God is both immanent in the physical world and transcendent beyond it , not identified with it , yet not an absentee beyond reach . When , therefore , the materialistic scientists , sweeping the heavens with their telescopes , splitting their atoms to essential parts , or examining living cells with their microscopes , return to tell us that they find not God in all their search , it leaves us quite unperturbed ; for examining you or me by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chemicals , mostly H2O , and they do not find our self or personality ; yet we know that this self , though a spiritual entity , is at once the most real and the most valuable thing about us . It is precisely what enables us to enter into conscious fellowship with others . As our spirit is more fully disclosed through some parts of the body than through other parts ? more through the eyes than through the elbows , for example ? so God is disclosed more completely through certain creations than through others , most adequately in human personality in its highest expressions . As we are unable to express our real selves adequately through the body , so God is unable to get His best expressed even through human personality . Both Professor Dewey and Professor Wiernan are correct in their insistence that religious thinking must not , // like pantheism , identify God with everything in general . It must select those elements of highest worth as being the true manifestations of God . It must reject as ungodlike those materials , operations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been con-quered and suffused by the divine mind and purpose . Human nature has self-consciousness and a degree of freedom ; so that man can react intelligently and co-operatively toward this God who seeks expression through man . And in the interaction of God 's expres-sion and man 's response we find the possibilities of high religion . " Our genuine acquaintance with and mastery over nature , " says Dean W. R. Matthews , " is built upon one assumption , that we are continuous with an other ' which is not merely other , not simply alien , but responsive . " 6 Although certain interpretations of Jesus have served only to confuse the necessary distinction which we seek between the human and the Divine , there is a way of thinking about Jesus which may further our quest for definiteness in this matter . One may look upon the Nazarene , to use Professor Hocking 's words , " as the measure of the extent to which the Divine may be ex-pressed in the human . " Even the Christian creeds , if we read them rightly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is God , " but rather , " Jesus is the THE HUMAN AND THE DIVINE God-man " ; and this latter is to say , in our way of thinking , that he was a man who uniquely expressed the divine nature . ' There need be no confounding of God with man , just as there need be no confounding of God with a tree . The important matter is to keep the artist distinct from the medium through which he works . This viewpoint follows as a corollary from the new distinctions which we achieved in the discussion of the natural and the supernatural . As in that case , so here , the religious values are conserved . Man does not wor-ship his humanity , he does not pray to himself . He does not unduly exalt or abase his nature . He neither cowers before God nor flippantly dismisses Him . He gives himself with quiet purpose to meeting the condi-tions under which the upsurging of divine life may find more complete expression in his own human per-sonality . We are now in a position to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an experience of kinship with the Deepest Reality in the Universe , and hence of membership in an infinitely meaningful world and of sharing in an ever unfolding life . " ' And we see the force of Professor Van Dusen 's statements : " Certainty of God has been not so much a conclusion // of a chain of reasoning as an awakening to the deeper significance of familiar experience . . . . It is not pri-marily by seeking that we find out God but in living that we are found of Him . " And we may agree with Professor Bennett 's thought : " If there is a God at all ... He is the all-important reality upon which we depend at every moment of our lives and to which all the good in us is a response . And yet , when we have said that , we still must search to discover the nature of that reality even though we accept its existence as the surest fact with which we start . " " Let us make it clear with Dewey and Wieman , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as distinguished from the natural ways in which we know everything else . But our knowledge and ex-perience of God comes like that of all spiritual values , such as those we find in music or friendship . Scientific analysis does not bring us their fullness . We need no logical proof to convince us of their reality . Having responded to them on the assumption that they are valid realities , our reason may , and indeed should , do what it can to explain and make intelligible the won-derful experience which is already ours . But we simply have no scientific techniques for weighing or measuring or proving or discovering that subtle element in per-56 IS HUMAN NATURE HOPELESS ? sons which commands our highest respect and love . Yet not for one moment do we doubt its existence , real-ity , or value . So it must be in our knowledge and expe-rience of God . This is the nature of high religious faith . It is trifling to speak of it as " the attempt to believe what is n't so , " though this criticism may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low religion . It has troubled some people to have religionists claim that God is known by " intuition , " but the term may be used to describe just the method by which one knows the soul of his friend . In relation to God , intuition is " a perception of kinship between the soul of man , the deepest reality in the universe , and ultimate value . " 11 This perception takes place in experiences of beauty , truth , and goodness . But it is incorrect to say that God is beauty , truth , or goodness . Just as it is not adequate to say that God is a " principle " or a " process " or the sum of our ideals . Turning now to human nature , it is apparent from what has been said already that high religion escapes the sentimental over-exaltation of man which is im-plicit in humanism , naturalism , and romantic Protestant liberalism . Joseph Wood Krutch , Oswald Spengler , and Reinhold Niebuhr , attacking from different directions , have destroyed any illusions one might have cherished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high religion also delivers us from the opposite error of pessimism as to man 's possibilities . It neither exalts human nature to the skies nor abases it to incompetence , futility , and doom . It views human nature as that part of all nature in which God may express himself most completely , but it is fully aware of how incomplete the divine expression has proven , even in human nature , up to the present stage of history . High religion does not hesitate to apply the adjective " sinful " to human nature . It knows that the heart of man is deceitful and desperately wicked , that man left to his own devices , works surely the wrecking of his own personality , and the destroying of the great social values . But it brings the good news , through its abiding vision of God , that man is not left to his own devices ; that he is hounded by the spirit of the Most High ; that he has responded and may more fully respond to the life of moral fellowship with God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind and conscience , the ennobling of his ideals , and the redirection of his will and purpose . It is evident how far removed is high religion 's view of God and man from that of the slightly revised form of Calvinism known in Europe as the " Theology of Crisis , " and elsewhere as Barthianism , which is attracting wide attention in England and America . Its car-58 IS HUMAN NATURE HOPELESS ? rective may have been needed by washed-out liberalism , humanism , and naturalism , but high religion has its own inner correctives against such excesses , and can look only with doubt upon a theology which plunges us back into such supernaturalism.12 High religion is conscious of human frailty and fini-tude ; it sees the need for regeneration and redemption and it encourages man to take that " serious and sup-pliant attitude toward the Determiner of Destiny , " which Professor J. B. Pratt described as the true reli-gious response . It inclines man to turn to God in obedience , reverence , and worship . It leaves man hum-ble before the deep mysteries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it bids him arise to walk the earth like a prince and son of God , not like a slave , brow-beaten and craven . It invites man to be born anew into such freedom and nobility through realiza-tion of his kinship and fellowship with the Divine , and by utilizing all the resources of knowledge , skill , and moral dynamic which lie ready to hand awaiting man 's recognition and his intelligent use of them in the creation and discipline of his personality and of his society . // NEW VIEWPOINTS OF HIGH RELIGION The Historical and Scientific Approach Permanent Values of the Bible The Abiding Appeal of Jesus The Problem of Sin and Evil What Happens When We Pray ? Can We Hope for Immortality ? CHAPTER IV NEW VIEWPOINTS OF HIGH RELIGION We have seen that religion is centrally concerned with the two foci , God and man , and with the relationships possible between the two . The new viewpoints of high religion on this subject , being the heart of the religious message and faith , we have sketched in the preceding chapter . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now deal . What , for example , are the positions of high religion on the Bible and the subject of revelation , on Jesus and his authority , on sin and redemption , on the problem of evil , on the nature and efficacy of prayer , on immortality and its nature ? Here is material for several volumes , but we shall undertake to give at least the approach of high religion to these questions and certain of the new viewpoints which may justifiably be held . In line with its insistence on reasonable faith , high religion approaches all these questions from the historical and scientific point of view , accepting , in general , the positions now commonly held in liberal circles . But recognizing the limitations of the scientific // method , especially its inability to give a full account of meaning and value , high religion does not hesitate to supply the lack . It employs the historical and scientific methods to set the subject in a new light , to get at the facts , and thus to clear the ground of earlier naive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new foundations it builds a positive faith which rationalism and naturalism could not achieve ; for religion 's chief interest is precisely in meanings and values for life , not merely in accurate analysis and description of facts and processes . Therefore , it challenges some of the barren conclusions and underbeliefs which have become common in certain liberal quarters . It recognizes that as yet the facts are not all before us and that accordingly some problems must await final solution . But it submits to the test of life such interpretations as seem legitimate on the basis of present knowledge . Approaching the Bible in this spirit , we find that it is still the " Book of Life " in that it gives us the priceless record of the most significant movement in religious thought and history that our world has ever known . The Hebrew people were the spiritual pioneers of our race . They had a genius for God and the good life . They have bequeathed to us a heritage of religious insight and faith , a succession of religious // seers , prophets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal . As we turn to the Greeks for classical art and to the Middle Europeans for classical music , so we must turn to the Jews for the classical expression in ethics and religion . This is not to deny valuable contributions from other peoples and cultures , but only to say that no one who today seriously desires the best in religious thinking and living can afford to do aught but saturate himself in the higher contributions of the Jewish-Christian traditions . The Bible furnishes our access to these treasures which have so tremendously influenced the spiritual destiny of mankind . It continues to hold its place in the esteem of intelligent and spiritually literate people because , as Emerson suggested , it comes out of profounder depths than any other book . Among the factors which have made the Bible an alien book for our generation , blinding them to its genuine values , are the misinterpretations and false claims promulgated by its sincere but mistaken defenders . Let us briefly examine some of these . First , it is claimed that the Bible was given by supernatural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supernatural in the preceding chapter has robbed this claim of its meaning . Parts of the Bible are beyond question inspired writing , more highly inspired than any to be found elsewhere . But we // should prefer not to use the word " supernatural " to explain this fact . The work of geniuses in any field may be called inspired . And it is equally true that parts of the Bible , such as genealogical tables , census lists , and annals of the kings , are neither inspired nor inspiring . Even the prophet 's " thus saith the Lord " is seen to have been arrived at by his study of history , his ethical sensitivity and his unique insight into the nature and purpose of the self-revealing God . Second , it is claimed that the Bible , being supernaturally inspired , is inerrant and infallible , whereas a careful reading of it will reveal inaccuracies , conflicting statements and irreconcilable viewpoints . To say that these have crept in through mistranslations and copyists ' errors is to beg the question , since no original manuscripts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts simply do not accord with more recently ascertained facts and our knowledge of the laws of nature . Even to say that the Bible is infallible only in matters of religious faith and ethical practice is a difficult claim to sustain , since the Scriptures offer both high and low conceptions , between which we must choose . To maintain that it will infallibly guide one to true faith and practice provided he knows what to accept and what to reject , removes any final reason for retaining the word infallible . Third , it is claimed that the Bible is a final author- // ity , to be upheld in the face of any evidence to the contrary , while the facts presented above make it impossible for us to take it in this way . Our generation is skeptical of final authorities in any field , for it sees how increasing knowledge and unfolding experience continually modify man 's standard of appraisal . There are characters and teachings in the Bible which remain authoritative to this day , simply because they have never been surpassed . But since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from among the other lesser offerings of the Bible , the seat of authority is transferred to those best qualified to do the choosing and interpreting . Fourth , many today are estranged from the Bible by the appeal that its contents be taken literally ? miracles , legends , origin-myths , poetry , apocalyptic writings and all , whereas the literary study of the Bible , together with the findings of modern knowledge , make some literal interpretations impossible . Our attempt today must be to recognize the limitations of thought-form and world-view out of which the Bible came , and to penetrate through these to those abiding elements of truth and beauty which they may enshrine , holding to the permanent values and reinterpreting them in the thought of our own day . Fifth , the misrepresentation of the Bible , as offering one perfect level of religious thought and ethical stand- // and from beginning to end , has alienated the modern mind , since the evidence is plain that the Bible contains a mixture of low religion and high religion , and shows a dcvelUiptucnt from lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards . Here again discrimi-nation is necessary , and while it is most enlightening to trace the steps of this gradual development , we can give our assent and allegiance only to the highest which the Bible affords . When all this has been said , we return to our conten-tion that the Bible reveals to us the possibilities of man 's life in fellowship with God in such profound and moving terms that it remains the basic book for high religion and a unique medium for introducing each oncoming generation to the highest way of life . ' This is primarily true , because along with all its other great contributions , it gives us Jesus , to whose match-less personality and supreme revelation we now turn our attention . For high religion Jesus remains " the Master of the centuries " not on the basis of the elaborate touches with which his figure has been adorned in legend , song , and dogma at the hands of amazed and devoted followers , THE ABIDING APPEAL OF JESUS but by ' reason of the essential qualities in him which in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a mark of l ttleness not to recognize greatness when we see it , and a mark of superficiality to let the forms of earlier faith blind us to the grace and beauty that once walked our earth in the p : rson of Jesus of Nazareth . So , when the New Testament records have been critically appraised , when the first-century categories of explanation have been understood , and when due allowance has been made for the lavish theological and emotional tributes of the intervening centuries , people of discernment and unprejudiced judgment still freely confess that in Jesus we find a unique personality and career which justify us in speaking of him not as a son of God along with others , but the Son of God , not as a master in things of the spirit , but as the Master . Those of our day who are troubled by traditional claims of deity for Jesus are wont to ask , " But was not Jesus just a man ? " The weakness in that question lies in the use of the word " just , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and this he surely was not . The least that can be said of him is that our race has produced no greater spiritual and religious genius . Since we are never able fully to explain genius , even in men of lesser stature , it is natural that the followers of Jesus from the beginning down to our times are found seeking to describe his unique personality in whatever superlative // thought-forms are characteristic of their day . In the First Century it was customary to account for therwise inexplicable greatness by supposing superna ral birth and divine paternity , while Greek thought supplied the suggestion of eternal pre-existence with God and incarnation in human form . Jews saw in Jesus the divine Messiah ; Greeks , the eternal Logos made flesh ; while apocalyptic hopes enthroned him at the right hand of God , whence he should come again to judge the quick and the dead . Even so , Christian thought insisted that Jesus should never be confounded with God or made equal to God . To say that Jesus is God was ruled out as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Father are one " and " he that hath seen me hath seen the Father " must be construed in terms of unique spiritual oneness and moral fellowship through which Jesus revealed God as universal Father , one who , to quote his words from the same Fourth Gospel , " is greater than I. " It should be noticed that this Fourth Gospel as well as the writings of Saint Paul , for all their exaltation of Jesus , make no use of the theory of virgin birth to account for his greatness . Nor does Saint Paul ever pray to Christ . High religion 's approach to the understanding of Jesus has been suggested in the preceding chapter ( see pages 54-55 ) . It may view him as both son of God and son of man , remembering that the word " son " and // " Father " are metaphors borrowed from the analogy of our family life and seek to express the fact that the divine 1ife and character find unique expression in Jesus . It recalls that Jesus appeared first as a prophet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he believed was about to come into full realization . High religion is deeply indebted to Jesus as a prophet and teacher who exposed the fallacies of external and legal religion , becoming the champion of spiritual religion and revealing in both word and character a quality and method of life which by its sheer beauty and moral insight stands as the hope and the challenge of our contemporary living . High religion is under no obligation to accept the ancient frame-work of Jesus ' thought , and realizes that some of his teachings were limited to the situation of his day , but it finds a contribution of rarest worth in his revelation of God and his understanding of the possibilities of human life when conformed to the ends of God 's spiritual " family " or " kingdom . " It recalls , however , his own injunction , " Take heed what you hear , " and knows that discrimination and careful interpretation are necessary in the mediating of his matchless contribution to the life of our changing world . If Jesus accepted the role of Jewish Messiah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritualize the current conceptions of his day , he gave his followers the basis // for erecting a structure of messianic hopes and apocalyptic expectations of his return to judge and rule the world which were doomed only to disappointment . Because high religion is not interested in whether Jesus could be the Jewish Messiah , it is all the more interested in his divine sonship and his mediatorship of God 's life to the world . It will use the name Christ as a symbol of the fact that death could not defeat the personality of Jesus and that he remains a fresh and vivifying person in the hearts of those who admire and love him . It will recall that Jesus in his earthly ministry was less interested in what rank men gave to him than he was in having them follow him into the realization of their own sonship with God , in having them repent of all that shut them off from God 's expression through them , being born anew into the life of fellowship with God and man . High religion looks upon the death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the will of God as he conceived it ; his determination not to retreat from his God-given ideal and mission in order to save his life ; his insight that men are changed most profoundly not when some one teaches and exhorts them , but when some one loves them enough to suffer with them and for them ; and his conviction that the purposes of God may be furthered rather than defeated by such faithfulness even unto death . The cross reveals the divine love // and goodness working through seeming defeat to eventual triumph over man 's ignorance , pride , and selfishness , and thus breaking the heart of callous and selfwilled men , reconciling them to God and redeeming their highest nature from bondage to the lower ideals and passions . In this sense Jesus has been and still is the Saviour and Redeemer of men . Thus high religion can say from the heart , " God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself . " In the death of Christ we have the most profound revelation of God 's undefeated love and His eternal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ High religion is discriminating in its attitude toward the miraculous element in the life of Jesus , knowing that the reporters wrote in a day when it was common to explain unusual events in terms of supernaturalism ( see pages 44-50 ) . Some of the stories such as faith healings are now understandable to us on grounds other than miraculous . However , it would be unscientific in our not-yet-understood universe to limit dogmatically what might be possible to a highly spiritualized personality such as Jesus . High religion can afford to reject certain miracles , to accept certain facts minus the miraculous interpretations of the First Century , and to hold an open mind on others , since it never bases its judgment of the value and significance of Jesus on the ground of miraculous happenings . // All this makes it possible for us to take an appreci-ative view of the authority of Jesus . Final authority , as we have seen , is beyond our reach . All remains authori-tative for us which , in the opinion of the best qualified judges , is without cqual in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his high authority over the minds and consciences and hearts of men . For , as Father Tyrrell says , it is " the authority that truth exer-cises over the mind , and goodness over the conscience , and love over the heart and affections ; the authority that true Manhood exercises over men , true Personality over persons . " It was Emerson who said that the name of Jesus is not so much written as plowed into the history of the world . And Lecky , student of European history , testi-fied that the record of the life of Jesus had done more to regenerate and soften mankind than all the disqui-sitions of philosophers and all the exhortations of moralists . Those who have known the fellowship of Jesus ' kindling personality can understand well why it is that his true followers , without waiting for heaven , " cast their crowns before him , lost in wonder , love , and praise . " On the subject of sin and its cure , notice has already been taken of high religion 's realism about the sinful- // ness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revelation in Jesus of how man may be redeemed from spiritual death to spiritual life ( see pages 72-73 ) . High religion knows that no clear-cut distinction can be made between individual sin and social sin , but its chief emphasis is on man 's being delivered from those sins which have largest social consequences . It deplores any personal attitudes or habits which make moral fellowship with God difficult or impossible , but it knows that the most deadly of these are just those sins which defeat the achievement of fellowship between man and man . Therefore it stresses the heinousness , not so much of the so-called Puritan sins , but rather of those on which the ethical sensitivity of Jesus led him to put his finger ? pride of intellect , blindness to spiritual values , pride of life , selfishness , callousness to human need , scorn of people who do not belong to one 's own group , complacency and hypocrisy , preoccupation with material possessions , hatred and greed . Is it not because of these that our world 's life is impoverished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? High religion is not content with treating the symptoms but believes in removing the causes which , although they have become incorporated in our social systems and traditions , may be traced back to the failures of the human mind , heart , and will . It knows that men must be convicted of these sins which play // such widespread havoc , that they must repent and be " born anew , " being changed from the inside out . Thus it believes that human nature can be changed in its inner quality , in its responses to life-situations , and in its attitudes toward God and man . A new emphasis of the evangelistic message needed today is that which will begin with the corruption and disintegration of our social relationships and institutions , paint a picture of what they might be if redeemed by love , intelligence , good will and true fellowship , and then call on men to surrender those individual and group motives , habits and practices which make social redemption difficult or impossible . It should be made plain that there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participation in , and responsibility for , social systems which cast an evil blight on human personality and block the manifestation of God in the life of man . The individual will be " saved " when he has become so conformed to the divine nature that God can work through him the redemptive processes of love and justice and truth . To this he may be constrained by the sacrificial life and death of Jesus , by the claims of God upon his allegiance , and by the appeals of a suffering and needy world which has lost its way . It is the viewpoint of high religion that whatever may have been the origin of evil in the world , the responsibility for the perpetuation of evil must be more largely // shouldered by man and not blamed on the Devil or on God . It can not accept the theory of personalizing the forces of evil in a Devil , because that explanation is unnecessary and relieves man of his own responsibility for evil . The " problem of evil " and seemingly unmerited suffering may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown upon it by our philosophy of a universe still in the making , and our conception of God as seeking to permeate the world with His intelligence , goodness and power , but being hitherto only partly successful in achieving His purpose . After all , one has to choose between a world created in static perfection , in which there would be no change , no birth , no growth , no learning by experiment , and a world which is in process of creation by the operation of just these factors . And since it actually is this latter sort of world , imperfection is still present , and this accounts for the chief causes of evil and suffering ? ignorance , sickness , crudeness , childishness , and all the undisciplined motives and passions of men . The character of God is not impugned , because we no longer think of Him as creating by fiat all that is , no longer attribute to Him some omnipotence which could change all in a twinkling if He only would , but rather see in Him just those immanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will which are at work to overcome evil with good . Most of the // evil can be overcome as man comes to know and obey the laws of the universe , physical and moral , and as he gives himself to conscious co-operation with God in His age-long and mighty task of bringing order out of chaos . The theory and practice of prayer have shared in the confusion incident to the transition from low religion to high religion . The quality of one 's religion can be fairly well judged by what he believes about prayer and by the way in which he employs it . The viewpoint of high religion on the subject of prayer follows as a corollary to its conception of God and man , and its view of how God works in the universe . Prayer becomes a liability rather than an asset when it is conceived as a magical short-cut even to worthy and desirable ends ; when it expects God to accomplish mysteriously such tasks as await our own application of intelligence , good will , and courageous experimentation ; when it thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , when it is used to obtain one 's uncriticized desires , material or spiritual . It is especially futile when centred upon oneself or one 's own group with disregard for the rights and needs of others , and when it is touched with the pharisaic note , " I thank thee that I am not as other men . " When such false attitudes and expectations have been 78 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE PRAY ? eliminated high religion is eager to use prayer as an appropriate and valuable means of creating and affirming the truly religious attitude in life . It will see the very impulse to pray as a stirring of the divine Spirit at work within us , drawing forth the best that is in us to join in fellowship with the Most High who also transcends our little human existence . Prayer may then include the following elements : adoration and praise , not to some anthropomorphic cosmic king who demands it , but as a spontaneous tribute to that in God which thrills us with its greatness , worth , and beauty ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our human nature ; confession of our limitations , frustrations , short-comings , and failures to express more fully the divine truth and goodness and beauty in our own living ; yearnings , aspirations and desires for all the highest that is possible but as yet unattained in us as individuals and in our institutional and social life ; dedication of all our powers to conscious co-operation with the divine ideals and purposes . In prayer and worship we consciously dare to set all life , its worst and its best , openly before God , allowing the divine light and love to blow through it , winnowing the wheat from the chaff , conserving what is valuable and carrying away what is worthless . Prayer thus results in increasing our sense of conscious fellowship with God ; in criticizing our false motives , desires , and // conduct ; in developing and establishing the new attitudes and habits necessary to life at its highest ; in increasing our spiritual and ethical sensitivity ; in removing the barriers of pride and fear and selfishness which cut us off from man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without ; in releasing unsuspected power for both the high and the common tasks of our day ; in sustaining us amid the tragedies and trials of our pilgrimage ; in rallying us to the support of our finest ideals ; in restoring perspective on life when viewed from the divine outlook ; and in adding zest and joy and meaning to our whole existence . If it be asked whether all this could not be accomplished by a process of self-examination , meditation , and auto-suggestion , without bringing God into it , we would not deny certain benefits of such a process , but can only say that if God is , and is what we have supposed Him to be , the whole experience is raised to new heights of meaning , dignity , and value when it becomes conscious communion with the Divine . After all , prayer is not , merely a technique for " getting results , " but a way of giving the best that we have to the best that we know ; and if our religious presuppositions are valid , the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of immortality with open-mindedness . Considering the evidence in-8o CAN WE HOPE FOR IMMORTALITY ? conclusive , whether for or against the continuance of individual personality beyond death , it encourages its adherents not to indulge in either over-belief or underbelief on this subject . Confronted by the tragedy of bereavement they may " look sunward and with faces golden Speak to each other softly of a hope , " remembering that it is as a hope that the New Testament most often speaks of life after death . Meanwhile , we believe that God 's life is eternal life in which we become partakers here and now through conscious fellowship with Him . With all our belief in the value of human personality , we will not demand that it must survive individually after death ; we do not even know whether from God 's viewpoint such survival would be the best thing . We will never make the thought of our on-going spiritual existence dependent on bodily resurrection . As Christians , we can not say with Saint Paul that if Christ be not . risen our faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory over death , no sanctions for ethical living , and that we might as well " eat , drink and be merry for tomorrow we die . " We will have more faith in God and less in this view of Saint Paul 's ? more faith that God will accomplish whatever is good and beautiful and consistent with His on-going creative purposes . 81 NEW VIEWPOINTS OF HIGH RELIGION , In the face of death , even so-called untimely death , we will not fear , or rave , or despair , but will meet it in the same quiet faith with which we confront other vicissitudes and tragedies of life . One does not live long or profoundly without discovering that there are many things worse than death . The great mistake is to clutch at life with greedy hands and at any price . Whoever tries primarily to save his own life for this world or any other will lose it . Once we have renounced our imperative demand for continuing life at any cost , the eternal life of God is able to work out through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this suffices for us , if we really trust God . This becomes our attitude , not only toward our own existence but also toward that of our comrades whom we love . We believe this attitude is true to some of the most profound insights of Jesus himself . We will not use the hope of heaven and the fear of hell as the prime motives for the quality of our life here on earth , since we find stronger motives in the consequences of low living and of high living for our own generation and for those who come after us . We will be both warned and encouraged by the saying , " How prudently most men creep into nameless graves , while now and then one or two forget themselves into immortality . " We do not need the hope or the fear of the future life as an instrument for propagating our re-82 CAN WE HOPE FOR IMMORTALITY ? ligion , for we know it to be still true that if they will not believe in God as revealed in Moses and the prophets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus himself be raised from the dead . It is enough for us that Jesus and those who follow in his train do conquer death in a spiritual sense and live on to help create the kingdom of God through " the power of an endless life . " In this chapter and in the one preceding , enough has now been said about the theological viewpoints of high religion to indicate its method and its spirit in working toward the reconstructions of religious faith . If there are specific questions upon which we have not touched , the reader can doubtless deduce for himself the approximate positions on these questions which high religion would take . If one has known only low religion he may feel that certain values are lost in the transfer to high religion . This is the first impression in all transitional experience . When one becomes at home in high religion , he finds that the seeming losses are more than recompensed in the new freedom and in the creative values of his freshly won faith . How one may become at home in high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question to which our attention must next be turned . 83 Evading the Religious Response When Religion Freezes How God Becomes Real for Us Some " Nearly-Religious " Experiences Life without God : Its Losses Is This Mysticism ? 87 89 91 96 IOI // FINDING GENUINE RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE One may give intellectual assent to the interpretations of high religion , admitting that theoretically such religion seems both possible and desirable , yet fail to appropriate it in one 's own life , never knowing it as a personal experience . We might even say that those who , however naively , share the experience of low religion have many advantages over those who pride themselves on approving only high religion , yet stand outside , never committing to it their own lives . To know about God may be only interesting intellectual play ; to know God , in actual sense of fellowship , is lifetransforming . And we have already described the religious experience as one 's living all of life in conscious recognition of fellowship with God . How then does one find his way into such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the outset it is well to recall that our very conception of God shows Him to be the divine Spirit seeking to express Himself more fully in all things and especially in human personality ( see pages 52-57 ) . Our // religious experience is therefore in the nature of a response , a recognition and realization of the already present God . Such is the degree of our freedom that we are not forced to make this response . We may avoid coming to terms with God , either through ignorance of His existence or through consciously hiding from Him in a vague fear of the moral demands implied in knowing Him . One of the tragedies of human existence is the fact that man , who alone of all creation is capable of making such response , should so often fall short of this supreme experience . In his book , How Can I Find God ? Leslie Weatherhead makes much of the point that men often fail to find reality in religion because they are hiding from God . He shows how they may do this in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuts God out ; in throwing up barriers of intellectual doubt when really unwilling to come to terms with the moral implications ; in busying themselves with service to men ; in " religious exercises " themselves , when used as a screen ; in refusal of right relations with men ; and in such subterfuges as rationalizing our selfishness , fearing the ridicule of friends , or preferring the life of the worldling . This may sound like old-fashioned evangelistic teaching , but it is still psychologically sound , and it is still applicable in our relationships to the God of high religion . If we see this and are ready to // deal rigorously with the obliquities of our own consciences and the easy corruptions of our moral natures , we are ready for the primary step set forth in the scriptural phrase , " If with all your hearts ye truly seek Me , ye shall ever truly find Me . " Into this quest for a conscious sense of fellowship with the Divine , man must throw his whole being ? intellect , emotions , and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intellectual task , it is because one can not be asked to respond with heart and will to that which does not command his reason and intelligence . Once the mind has been reasonably satisfied , the whole man must follow along into the experience if it is to have the sense of reality . When Jesus pointed out that the first commandment of all is , " Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind , and with all thy strength , " he was recognizing the need for bringing the whole personality into the relationship . The very word " love , " however , becomes a hard saying for modern would-be believers with their attenuated , scientized , and impersonalized conceptions of God . It is not easy to feel such a whole-hearted passionate devotion as love toward " the cosmic urge , " " the upward thrust , " or " the integrating process . " Unable therefore really to keep the first commandment , many people of // our generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy neighbor as thyself , " endeavoring to persuade themselves that this , too , was religious experience , when they should have seen that it might be only non-religious ethical experience . Their patron saint was Leigh Hunt 's Abou ben Adhem , who , unable to qualify as one who loved the Lord , still managed , by loving his fellowman , to lead the list of those " whom the love of God had blessed . " The implication is that it makes little difference whether one can love God , or that loving man is the same as loving God . Now , no doubt one may begin by loving man and thus find his way toward loving God , when he recognizes that what he really loves in man is the divine element manifested in human guise . But it is equally true that one may love mankind ( to some extent ) without ever loving God or even believing in God . We say " to some extent " because the weakness of this philanthropic attitude unbacked by religious consciousness is that man can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times of great crisis he may approach it , but he reverts to self-interest as soon as the emergency is past . In " the first fine careless rapture " of some idealistic crusade , as in Russia today , he may discipline his own selfishness in the interests of others , but as soon as the first objectives of the drive are gained , greed and jealousy reassert their power to destroy love . So the tragedy // lies in man 's forsaking the first commandment in favor of the second commandment , only to discover what Jesus saw clearly , that devotion to the Most High comes logically first as the ground and motive for any love toward man which can be sufficiently profound and sustained . Humanism is not enough . Social idealism soon plays out . Only when man 's heart is touched by the flame of love for the Divine , will he love his fellowman deeply , universally , and timelessly . Religionists have been at pains to prove that God loves us , but religious experience requires also that we love Him . Otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceases to bring forth its natural fruitage of loving relationships between man and man . Perhaps this frozen religion explains the blight which has fallen on much of organized religious life , paralyzing its effectiveness as a socially redemptive force in a world given over to selfishness and hate . When God was conceived in the more anthropomorphic way as a near and loving heavenly Father , it was more easily possible to respond to Him with emotions of love and friendship . The problem now is how to develop , on the basis of our intellectual constructions , any response of feeling toward God that will give us the sense of fellowship with Him . Let us suggest three steps that are necessary for developing loving relation- // ships between persons , showing how they bear upon our achieving experience of God . The first step is recognition . It is difficult to feel love for a person whom we can not even identify . He must first be separated from the general mass of humanity so that we recognize him when we see him . Love for humanity as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak . So if we would find God we must first identify in our universe what is God and what is not God . We have already emphasized the necessity for this discrimination as against the indefinite confusing of God with everything that exists ( pages 53-54 ) . The fact that God is invisible and intangible should not discourage us , for so is the very thing we love in a human friend ? his " personality " or " self . " This we identify through its characteristic expressions . We can come to know the characteristic expressions of God , inferring from them the spirit ( soul , self , personality ) that is manifest in these expressions . The fact that we can not fully know God should cause less difficulty when we reflect how imperfectly we know the human beings whom we love . The second step is appreciation . This is a spontaneous response to something fine , charming , beautiful , or worthy in a person whom we have met . The first step was cognitive , an activity of the mind . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dis- // criminate and weigh , but are then touched and moved by something in the person that appeals to our sense of values . Unless there is such appeal the relationship tends to remain on the level of acquaintanceship and does not ripen into friendship or love . This appreciative response may make one feel embarrassed or free , awestruck or happy , quiet or talkative , calm or nervous , impressed or released , or filled with mixed emotions , but it is always moving and challenging to something deep within us . We may be sure there is in God , when once we recognize Him , such supreme greatness , beauty , goodness , power , and worth that the corresponding appreciation on our part will come spontaneously and will stir us to a degree that no other experience can equal . Those who seek to describe it emphasize variously the feelings of awe , peace , exaltation , unworthiness , joy , or comfort , that come with the sense of God 's true nature and presence . Notice that appreciation can not be commanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel it . When we really recognize the quality that is in God , the appreciation is naturally elicited . The third step is co-operation . When recognition has been followed by appreciation , we desire nothing so much as to know the person better , to talk , work , play , think , and share with him in the adventure of life . We like to discover more fully his ideals , purposes , and // plans and to be of some help to him . In this process of sharing , there develops the sense of comradeship , friendship , and a genuine love . In this third step two new elements appear . The will is brought into operation . We must choose to give ourselves to the relationship with the best that in us lies . And there must be mutuality in the experience , response from both parties . For , if the other person does not value and need and want us , it is difficult or impossible for any co-operation to be realized . In high religion 's conception of God it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working to express certain values in human personality , needing only our conscious response and intelligent co-operation to create and conserve yet higher values . We can understand something of His operations , catch a glimpse of His plans and ideals , undertake our share of responsibility , pledge to Him our loyalty , and thus develop a reasonable sense of close-knit life and fellowship , warmed by ever-increasing appreciations , until we can say in truth that we know what it means to love God . If some one protests that we have pressed the analogy too closely , that for him it still seems impossible to apply these steps in seeking consciousness of relatedness to God , we would ask him to try it sincerely with Jesus as the mediator of the experience . Jesus is one whom he can identify , whose characteristic expressions of mind and spirit he can learn to recognize . But , as // we have seen , these are precisely the effects of the clear shining of God through the personality of Jesus . What one sees there is God most adequately expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even upon the skeptic , an appreciative response to the beauty , grace , and power which are found in Jesus . If one has in himself any trace of capacity to respond to authentic greatness , he will be deeply moved by the figure of Jesus . Then he is in reality being moved by what is in God . If he does not fear at this point to surrender his life to the high but thrilling fellowship of Jesus , being constrained by the love of Christ and changed into his likeness , he may know that the love he comes to bear toward Jesus is in fact love toward the God there made manifest . Of course , one may respond to the man Jesus with mind , heart and will , without getting on through Jesus to God . But this is a misuse of Jesus , and one which he himself would deplore , for it was his desire that men should find through him their own higher comradeship ( sonship ) with God . Now , if one has truly sought the mediation of Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Christian fellowship and still pleads that Jesus himself is too remote and shadowy a person to serve in making God real in one 's experience today , we can only suggest that he fall back upon other relationships and experiences of contemporary life through which // God may also be discerned and appropriated , not so directly and fully as in Jesus , but nevertheless in ways that may have meaning for different temperaments and capacities of modern folk . The seeing eye , spiritual sensitivity , will still be indispensable even here ; and it is because life has dimmed our vision and calloused our hearts by its coarsening materialism that many of us today find it so difficult to sense God anywhere . Young people , especially , might be expected to bring enough fresh and unspoiled vision to this quest . A Cambridge student said to a group of churchmen , " Youth has a corner on the spirit of worship . " True , they tend to worship something , whatever appeals to them as highest and holiest . " God is a spirit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in truth . " Youth has the disposition to worship ? the spirit is there , but often they can not worship God in truth ; that is , they have discerned no true object of worship that they can identify as God . They go through deep and high experiences which might easily reveal God to those who know Him when they see Him , but their misconceptions of what God is supposed to be , unfortunately caught from other people , and the dullness of their own perceptions , induced by a crass and materialistic culture , prevent their recognition of God . All they can achieve is what might be called " near-religion " // and they often conclude that this is all that is possible for them . Let us scrutinize some of these experiences which are almost , but not quite , religious experiences , with a view to understanding the additional insight necessary to convert the situation into a genuine discovery of fellowship with God . People come , for example , into a church service of worship . They may have a wistful expectation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch with God . They mumble the prayers and half-heartedly sing the hymns . They listen to the sermon but can only partially understand or accept its presuppositions about God or Christ . They may receive some inspiration for practical living . But they feel themselves standing somewhat outside as spectators . They do not see God afresh , nor do they warm toward Him in their hearts nor feel any vivifying sense of His presence . A veil hangs before the holy place and they are unable to penetrate it . It remains only a nearly-religious experience . This may be true even in the communion service , or in such a high moment of life as one 's own wedding ceremony . The mood carries over into their attempts at private devotions , reading the Bible and trying to pray . There is a note of unreality , of acting a part , of abiding estrangement . Or , turning from religious services , one may seek the God of the out-of-doors . But nature may impress one // with awe-inspiring grandeur , flashing beauty , delicate intricacy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face the brooding , ever-creating spirit of God . One summer in the Rocky Mountains a student was told that if he would take an hour alone to expose himself to the contemplation of that panorama of snowcapped range , dark-lying forest and sunny plain he could scarcely escape becoming conscious of God . But he came back empty-handed . Being a mining engineer he could probably get no farther than lift of earthcrust , stratification of rock and soil , and speculation as to the possibilities of ore deposits . One sees in nature only what one brings the eyes to see . And this student 's conception of what is really meant by God was doubtless so hazy that he knew not what to look for as the possibly divine element expressed through the physical . Thus the " primrose by a river 's brim , " or the " flower in the crannied wall , " may for many people point to no spiritual reality beyond the object observed . Even those who are capable of experiencing nature-mysticism may get a sense of greatness , unity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which high religion speaks . Likewise , many of our contemporaries come to a moment of high artistic appreciation in the presence of great music , poetry , or painting , moved by their testament of beauty , but hearing in their own souls no word // of God . They may catch through the work of art something of the spirit of the artist , but they fail to make the next step of discerning in the artist himself the Spirit which is incarnate in him , using him to express something of transcendent loveliness . Thus when they enter into deep human relationships of friendship and love , they submit to the spell of the spiritual worth in the person of the friend or lover , but their thoughts do not extend to the supreme Creator of worth and value who is there finding partial expression in human personality . It is like the unintelligent idol-worshipper who attributes to the figure of wood or stone some , life or power , while the intelligent worshipper knows that the idol is to be approached only as a suggestion or symbol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idol . The modern lover may say to his beloved that he sees in her something " divine , " but if she should ask , " Do you mean you see God in me ? " there might ensue one of life 's most embarrassing moments . He is using only a popular figure of speech . Perhaps this explains how men can look even at Jesus without seeing in him God being made manifest . Caught in the tragic experiences of life , the death of some loved one , the sudden blasting of hopes and dreams , the crash of the love of a life-time ? experiences through which God-conscious persons often come into // a most profound sense of the comradeship of God in their suffering ? most of our contemporaries see only a blank wall of despair . They may face the experience with admirable stoicism , but the tragic sense of our little life does not point them to any higher Life and Love in God which knows no ultimate defeat . They may engage in the struggle for some great social ideal , joining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , freedom , or peace on earth ; but they may have no consciousness that these are the divine ideals , that they themselves are being used by the eternal Creator of social values , and that they are missing reinforcement of vision and dynamic by not viewing their task as conscious co-operation with God . Once more , they may resolve , like Ulysses , " To follow knowledge like a sinking star Beyond the utmost bounds of human thought . " But in all their seeking and finding of truth , delving into the secrets of history and nature , deducing from facts their meaning and value , they remain blind to the one supreme Fact and Value of the universe to which high religion gives the name of God . They speak of natural laws as if they could exist without a Lawgiver ; of the infinite order and harmony and teleology of the cosmos , as if it were the product of mere chance ; of the too LIFE WITHOUT GOD : ITS LOSSES noblest ideals of mankind as if they had evolved from protons and electrons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law within move them , as Immanuel Kant was moved , to the recognition of the divine operations , which the practical reason if not the pure reason might assign to God . Someone will say , " Granted that our generation achieves only near-religion , granted that in its highest experiences it fails to become conscious of God , what actual values are lost ? " In answer we might say that earlier in this chapter , as well as in each of our preceding chapters , we have touched upon certain genuine values for the enrichment of life which go by the board if high religion with its " living of all life in conscious fellowship with God " be ruled out . In the next chapter we shall show high religion 's contribution to social change , which would likewise be lost . The answer to our questioner lies in the burden of our whole contention for the necessity of high religion . In addition to these more general and social losses , we should like to point out further specific losses as they affect the individual . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the God of high religion does exist , He becomes the most important fact of our experience . Not to know this supreme element of truth , or to go on living as if it were not IoI FINDING GENUINE RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE true , is to condemn oneself to dealing with unreality and partiality throughout the whole realm of his life . If error is just as good as truth , if following error involves no unfortunate results in life , then of course the loss of experiencing God makes little difference . But it would be strange to find people of our generation , who pride themselves on getting at the actual facts , defending the thesis that error makes no difference , especially in the higher levels of spiritual experience . A second loss lies in the impoverishment of one 's appreciation . We know how poor is the existence of a human being who says that he " sees nothing " that moves him in nature , or great music , good pictures , high literature , or romantic love . Similarly poverty-stricken is the life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most High . His living is reduced by just so much toward the bovine levels of appreciating only the lesser , more obvious goods of mind and body . He gives himself to something less than the best . It follows that he loses in self-realization . His highest potential powers of mind , heart , and purpose are relatively undeveloped save in response to God . It is sometimes said of a person that he crawls the surface of the earth like an insect , never having known what it is to stand up and tread the earth like a man . He has never realized his potential human heritage . It is equally true that one may walk the ways of the world IO2 LIFE WITHOUT GOD : ITS LOSSES only as a man , never realizing that he was meant to live as a son of God . It is difficult to show the insectlike person what a different and more glorious existence lies within his reach . So it is hard to convince the person who knows not the fellowship of God that such an experience would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never dreamed . But the testimony of those whose lives have thus been transformed by the divine companionship is abundant and incontrovertible . Being born anew is not too strong a term to describe the experience . Another loss suffered when one fails of religious experience is that of self-discipline in its higher degrees . We know in human relationships that nothing imposes upon us so strict a discipline as our attempt to qualify for the respect , friendship , or love of the finest people whom we know . We realize that for genuine fellowship with them our minds must be keener and better furnished ; our imaginations must be alert and creative ; our conversation must be worthy , witty , and wise ; we must slough off uncultured and degrading attitudes and habits ; we must know and love their ideals , be able to grasp their viewpoints and be somewhat at home in the world of taste and discrimination in which they move . Yet nothing could be more valuable for us than just the discipline which this entails . We go about it gladly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disagreeable . The old ways and habits lose their interest . We see discipline as the means to self-realization as well as the pathway into the enrichment of sharing in the nobler life of the person with whom we desire to associate . How much more then does this self-discipline become necessary and ennobling when we aspire to genuine fellowship with God ! The very thought of it may at first disturb our complacency , shatter our self-satisfaction , humble our pride , criticize our cheap desires , reveal the shabbiness of our characters , and demand a change in much of our way of life . Yet , in our best moments , do we not ' mow that this is precisely what most people of our generation need ? And when one has come through such regenerating experiences into the higher realization of spiritualized living can he be aught but eternally grateful that there was comradeship transcendent enough to inspire the change ? Someone will ask , " Is not this experience of God based on mysticism ? " And to this we must answer yes . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common example , again , is our experience of human personality . We have never seen the personality of a friend , only its manifestations . We can not analyze it , can not even prove its existence . We can not fully explain to another what the relationship with I04 IS THIS MYSTICISM ? a lover means to us ; nor can we defend on grounds of reason alone our surrender to its charm . Only those who themselves have known love can comprehend our expe-rience , and even then they may wonder at our choice of the person who has come to mean so much to us . It is important to keep in mind that this is just what the word mystical means . It does not mean magical , or superstitious , or purely imaginative response to some-thing non-existent . If our generation can be aroused to the validity of such experience of the God of high religion , it may find its way to a renaissance both for individuals and for society . Many a person will awake like Jacob at Bethel to say , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it not . " " The angels keep their ancient places ; ? Turn but a stone and start a wing ! ' T is ye , ' t is your estranged faces That miss the many-splendoured thing . " 1 When this realization of our own limitations once dawns upon us , we shall be in a position to face our selves frankly , deal courageously with whatever has blinded us to God , give up whatever it may be in ow lives that shuts us off from recognition , appreciation and co-operation with Him , and so , gradually or sud FINDING GENUINE RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE denly find the sense of His presence becoming a reality to us . " I ask no dream , no prophet-ecstasies , No sudden rending of the veil of clay , No angel-visitant , no opening skies ; But take the dimness of my soul away . " When that dimness of the soul begins to disappear , we may begin to find God and be found of Him in any of the high experiences described above in which He may never hitherto have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common tasks of life and in the most unexpected places . And we shall find in Him the deepest answer to our life 's quest . io6 CHAPTER VI HIGH RELIG ? ON AND SOCIAL CHANGE Is Religion an Opiate ? Can Religion Change the Social Systems ? Three Contributions of High Religion Social Change without Religion Religion and the New Morality Religion in a Barricaded World The Method of Love in Action How Radical Shall We Be ? CHAPTER VI HIGH RELIGION AND SOCIAL CHANGE " Religion is the opiate of the people . " So ran the Marxian doctrine ; and so the Russian Communists banished religion in order to get on with the social revolution . They conceived that religion stood in the way of a major social advance in the direction of justice and economic freedom . Religion , they contended , was sold out to the autocratic state power , kept the people contented with their miserable lot , blinded them with superstitious beliefs , promised them rewards in the next world instead of their common rights in this world , and lulled them into submission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is easy to point out that these criticisms were not without basis , but that they applied to the loin religion which prevailed in old Russia . It is important to see that low religion , even low Christianity in America , will always be a liability rather than an asset in achieving needed reconstructions in the I09 HIGH RELIGION AND SOCIAL CHANGE social order . Its supernaturalism on one hand , and its surrender to the low ethics of the status quo on the other hand , will always tend to relieve its adherents of the responsibility for social pioneering and for coura-geous experiment in building a better world . Thus Don Marquis could write in his column : " The thorough-going application of the principles of Jesus would blow most of our existing systems to Hinders ; but peo-ple who call themselves Christians will be able to pre-vent this catastrophe for a good many years , we dare say . " And Professor Schiller could say : " But the paleolithic Yahoo has been dosed with Christian ethics for two thousand years , and they have never either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral shock , and he has not brains enough to grasp their rationality . . . . Besides , the proposal to put Christian principles into practice would be bitterly opposed by all the churches in Christen-dom . " To which he appends this footnote : " This does not mean , of course , that there are no Christians in the churches , but only that they are not in control of these institutions . " 1 Now , high Christianity proposes to put the principles of Jesus into practice in a thorough-going way in spite of cautious " Christians " who will fear the social conse-IIO Is RELIGION AN OPIATE ? consequences . Perhaps it may convert these timid souls to the high religion of Jesus ? and so place the churches in the control of valiant followers of Jesus who will make impossible such taunts as those just quoted , and who will transform the churches into instruments for social regeneration . In order to do this it must recapture the temper of prophetic religion which combines moral passion with religious devotion to God . It must part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has sanctified attitudes and customs which stand in the way of justice , goodwill , and understanding . It must escape the toils of the type of mysticism in which one seeks to find God and claims to love God while failing to find and love one 's fellowmen . It must go beyond the individualism so prevalent in Protestantism which makes religion only a transaction between God and the individual , claiming some " salvation " which ignores a man 's share in the guilt of society or his responsibility to help in the transforming of that society . It must avoid the retreat into sacramentarianism which substitutes ritual for social redemption . And it must withstand resolutely the Barthian dualism which places the eternal and transcendent above and beyond the historical and ethical , making it no business of religion to realize the kingdom of God on earth . Recognizing that all these false emphases are characteristic of certain religious systems , high religion will rediscover full-III HIGH RELIGION AND SOCIAL CHANGE orbed religious experience and will either transform the systems or shake itself free to create a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of the moral and ethical rebuilding of society . In line with our contention in Chapter II that high religion proposes to bring its contribution to bear upon the whole of life , we must face with realistic understanding the existing patterns of our social life . Any attempt at social change brings us immediately to the major social institutions and inherited social systems which control for better or for worse the quality of human existence . These are the home , the school , the Church , the state , the business or economic system , and the informal smaller social groupings to which we belong . The upthrust of life , upon reaching human levels , tends to organize itself through these institutions because each one of them expresses some side of man 's essential nature and hence represents one of his chief interests and concerns . They have taken their present form as a result of centuries of human experimentation which sought to discover what social arrangements could best conserve and create human values . As they arise out of life they must be criticized according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they do to human personality . They put their stamp upon a per-II2 CAN RELIGION CHANGE THE SOCIAL SYSTEMS ? son long before he is aware of it ; they have made us what we are today . The remaking of either the individual or society involves the changing of these institutions . They are our greatest social asset and may become our greatest social liability ; an asset , in that they have preserved and purveyed to us all the inestimable cultural values and social gains of the past ; a liability , in their tendency to defeat the spirit which gave them birth , to become rigid and resistant to change , even change for the better . This resistance is due to our natural gratitude to them for all their benefits , leading to a blind loyalty which invests their external forms with the sanctity of customs , traditions , creeds , philosophies and constitutions which seem ultimate and unchangeable . We forget that they have often been altered in the past ; that viewed in the long perspective , they are really in a state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the wine of life ; that they must be elastic enough to allow for the fermentation of the new wine of growing social ideals , or else be burst by the pressure . When their forms become static and refuse to change , we get revolutions which usually destroy many values that might have been conserved by gradual revision of the institutions . The responsibility for revolutions rests in part upon the blind defenders of the status quo who demand that there shall be no change , no reinterpreta-I13 HIGH RELIGION AND SOCIAL CHANGE tion , no freedom to think or to experiment with new dreams and fresh ideals . Intelligent loyalty to one 's home , school , church , or government would require that his very gratitude , love , and interest should lead him to demand constant changes and improvements which would allow the institution to meet the newly discovered needs of contemporary life ; but this is seldom grasped . Each institution asks its youth for " loyal support " which too frequently means unintelligent perpetuation of outworn forms and theories . It is not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation to question the adequacy of these inherited systems to meet the new situations presented by life . In our day , especially , when the older forms , beliefs , and philosophies connected with home , church , state , and business have suddenly proven inadequate , any one is really disloyal , both to the best in our institutions and to the highest human values , if he does not throw himself heartily on the side of such modifications of the systems as are plainly indicated by the pressures and strains of modern disorder and human suffering . Where does high religion come into this picture ? It maintains that within this process of " upthrusting life " is God at work . It does not identify Him with the totality of life , many expressions of which are blind and crude and value-destroying , but sees Him as the Spirit CAN RELIGION CHANGE THE SOCIAL SYSTEMS ? who strives through it all to bring truth and order , intelligence and other high values into being . It sees God on the side of the development of human personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that man has no standards by which to rearrange human institutions more effectively , except as he discovers the ends toward which God is working and begins to conform his own disposition and desires toward those same ends , letting these control the changes which he makes in the social structure . High religion sees that the influence of these major institutions is interpenetrating . The ideals and functions of government , for example , control to a large extent the freedom of the other systems to perform appropriately their allotted tasks . The economic and business system can make or mar the efforts of all the rest . The type of education in home and school can either hinder or set forward the necessary reforms in other areas . So religion can never be bottled up in the water-tight compartment of the religious institution called the Church . It spreads its influence for weal or woe throughout the range of home , education , politics , and business . Since religion deals with man 's most profound needs and sums up his most inclusive spiritual aspirations , it can , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit and the external patterns of all the other social institutions . At its worst , however , it sur- " 5 HIGH RELIGION AND SOCIAL CHANGE renders to the spirit of the age and supports the pagan powers that be , or withdraws from the scene giving up the other social provinces as hopeless . As Albert Schweitzer says , " If the spiritual is strong , it creates world history . If it is weak , it suffers world history . " These systems , which we tend to think of in the abstract as unwieldy organizations resisting change , prove to be , after all , no more stubborn than the people who control them . If the conceptions , ideals , motives , and desires of people can be changed , then the systems can be changed . It is not even necessary to change all the people , but only a sufficient number of influential persons whose leadership determines the direction and drive of the masses . Unfortunately , those in control of our institutions usually have a personal stake in keeping them as they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who suffer under the existing regime , or by the privileged who are nevertheless somewhat enlightened and unselfish , or by the evident and widespread breakdown of the social institution itself . Religion is slow to give people up as hopeless . It believes in conversion , in changed lives , in its power to redeem the imaginations , motives , and wills of men . If it fails with those in control it can always appeal to those who are the victims of their control . If the religious institutions themselves have become moribund , subservient to things as they are , and ii6 THREE CONTRIBUTIONS OF HIGH RELIGION ineffectual to aid in man 's quest for social values , the spirit of high religion will seek first of all to redeem the Church itself . What , then , are the chief contributions which high religion may bring to the tasks of social reconstruction with which our world is now wrestling ? Touching life at every point as it does , the mere catalogue of its influences would be a long one . It may be best to summarize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , of the superb ideal for human life with which high religion confronts us . It would have us believe that men can actually live together as brothers ; that in the face of clashing interests between individuals and groups , men can and must subordinate their instinctive passions of lust and power to the good of the larger society ; that man must love his neighbor as himself , the strong bearing the burdens of the weak ; that thus justice may " roll down as waters , and righteousness as a mighty stream . " This is the social ideal which religion calls the " kingdom " or " family " of God . In the language of utopias there is nothing to match the heights and depths of this picture of the potentialities of human relationships . From the standpoint of present-day disillusionment with human nature , we are likely to view it wistfully but sadly as the figment of an impossible dream . Indeed it might be claimed that I17 HIGH RELIGION AND SOCIAL CHANGE religion does us only a disservice by taunting our harassed minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasp , placing us in a plight beside which the tortures of Tantalus pale into nothingness . This might stand as the final verdict , did not high religion in the next breath offer us the incomparable boon of a method by which this ideal is to be brought into reality . This is the method of so changing or redeeming human nature that it may suddenly or progressively rise to the levels set by the splendid ideal . For no modern cynic could be more realistic in his recognition of the frailty and incompetence of human nature than are Jesus and his spiritual descendants in high religion . Yet against the centuries of utterly discouraging human history they stake their faith in the method of redeeming love which will slowly but surely break through the callousness of pride , greed , and selfishness , that a new creature may stand out in man , matched to the stature of a nobler destiny . But no sooner are the implications of this method grasped by modern man , than his brow-beaten spirit sinks again in despair . For if the religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems impracticable . For it promises no quick results of enthroning justice , truth , and freedom in the world . And mankind demands quick results , even at the cost of hate and violence . Furthermore , this method runs // counter to man 's most cherished conception of how people are to be changed . For he is committed to the principle that one changes people by making them sufler for their ill-deeds ; while this method of redeeming love knows that the deeper changes are wrought in wrong-doers , not by making them suffer alone , but by suffering with them and for them . Contemporary man , therefore , lacks both the conviction and the greatness of soul necessary for putting this method of love into practice . In his spiritual bankruptcy he is scarcely capable of responding to this method himself , much less of becoming its protagonist and exemplar in a world given over to brute force . Wherein does religion help us , then , if it proposes an ideal , however beautiful , which floats only in the clouds , and bids us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which few are able to use ? Here high religion comes forward triumphantly with its third and most profound contribution , namely , the offer of divine resources which can transform us into men who can effectively use the method which alone gives promise of achieving the social ideal . It maintains that life in fellowship with God is the chief clue to the realization of the good life . For it presents its matchless ideal as a revelation of the mind of God for the life of man ; its strange and so difficult method as that by which God Himself works ; and the power for II9 HIGH RELIGION AND SOCIAL CHANGE its accomplishment as available only to those who share deeply in I pis mind , His spirit , and His life . Religion makes plain how men may enter this divine felbwship , culminating in the life that is hid with Christ in God . It will now be apparent that this religious fiith and experience arc directly related to the remaking of society . Yet it is just this element which is widely rejected in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruits of social reformation without the roots , and will not come to terms with the laws of the spiritual world . Much of the modern cynicism about religion 's ideal for man 's life , and much of the repudiation of its methcxl of redemptive love , are due to man 's inability or unwillingness to accept its offer of the divine resources . For men sec with a true insight that high religion 's threefold contribution stands or falls as one complete structure . There arc always those who want to know why we can not employ social idealism to bring about the needed changes in the social order without appealing to these contributions of religion . Some headway no doubt can be made on the basis of purely secular ethical idealism , but it is just the tendency to ignore the emphases of the religious viewpoint that makes insignificant or futile so much of man 's attempt at a better world . Without the transcendent ideal of society as a I20 SOCIAL CHANGE WITHOUT RELIGION potential kingdom or family of God , man is lost in the relativities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in the pattern of social rela-tionships will solve all his problems . The very abso-luteness of the religious ideal is needed as a critique upon man 's easy faith in the efficacy of superficial changes which do not require him to be born from above into the drastic discipline of moral fellowship with the Divine . Without the high religious method of redemptive love , man seeks to impose his ideals on children , crimi-nals , minority groups , and other nations by the methods of compulsion and violence , only to find that he but temporarily controls their outer conduct , converts them not at all to his ideal , and reaps a harvest of perpetu-ated resentment , hate , and warfare . " Mankind has not learned that the blow returned does not heal the pain of the blow suffered , neither does it touch the impulse that aimed that blow , nor cure the suffering from which that impulse leaped , nor make order of that moral chaos in which the suffering was born . " 2 Not having availed himself of the divine resources which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , he goes storming and swaggering about his social reforma-tions , only to find that they get society nowhere , and often land the reformer himself in the sloughs of hypoc-I2I HIGH RELIGION AND SOCIAL CHANGE risy or cynical pessimism . How different the way of Jesus and those who follow in his pathway ! Phillips Brooks has well said : " This was the optimism of Jesus . There was no blindness in his eyes , no foolish indis-criminate praise of humanity upon his lips . He saw the sin of that First Century a thousand times more keenly than you see the sin of the Nineteenth Century , and of America . But he believed in God . Therefore , he saw beyond the sin , salvation . He never upbraided the sin except to save men from it . He never beat the chains except to set the captive free ; never , as our cynics do , for the mere pleasure of their clanking . Not to condemn the world , but to save the world , ' was his story of his mission . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . " The road to social reconstruction is strewn with non-religious " tired radicals " who started out with high courage but were betrayed by small ideals , ineffective methods , and the absence of the faith and dynamic which might have been theirs in the experience of high religion . Miss Mabel Cratty used to say , " The constant raising of ethical harvests on minds unfertilized by reli-gious thought is akin to the process by which New England farms run out . " Professor Hocking speaks of our producing " so many stunted wills , wills prema-turely gray , and incapable of greatness , not because of I22 RELIGION AND THE NEW MORALITY lack of endowment , but because they have never been searchingly exposed to what is noble , generous and faith-provoking . " It is to save us from these weaknesses and failures that our ethical idealism needs the vision , the discipline , and the reinforcement of high religion . It is ever the function of religion , having criticized and sifted the prevailing moral codes of the day , to throw its support on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accord with the religious spirit and objectives . What else can religion do ? Yet , therein lies a grave danger . For while religious insight into the divine nature and purpose is only partial , it nevertheless tends to codify and make absolute the best that it discerns . Then when " new occasions teach new duties , " religion is found committed to its traditional pronouncements and is slow to see the necessity for change . Some ethical standards and virtues are relative to the needs of any given age and situation . True , there are notes in human nature and experience which are so dominant and recurrent that some very ancient virtues and standards seem never to lose their relevance . We come back again and again to the Ten Commandments ; or to the four cardinal virtues of the Greeks ? justice , prudence , temperance , and fortitude ; or to Jesus ' law of love . But the age-long vindication of these // central precepts of moral life may lead religion into the fallacy of thinking that all standards which it has once endorsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endorsing even clearly outworn codes and injunctions , religion often becomes the foe of social progress . High religion recognizes the relativity of some moral standards as well as the universality of others . It meets with realism the changed conditions of the new day and dares to believe that it can distinguish between moral standards and virtues which still have social value and those which must be discarded . With due humility , born of its knowledge that future changes may one day invalidate some of its own present ethical proposals , it follows the example of Jesus and says to our age , " Ye have heard it said . . . but I say unto you . . . . " At the same time high religion knows that the rediscovery and fulfillment of certain ancient ideals , lost or obscured by our modern sophistication , are just as important for the cure of social ills as the invention of certain new ethical precepts . In a recent magazine article ? Mr. Heimsath shows how inappropriate have become the older American vir-tues of industry , thrift , initiative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our laissez-faire policy // in the industrial world . He maintains rightly that the intensification of these individual virtues , along with patriotism and charity as social virtues , may only bring added misery to our world . And he suggests that industry , in terms of grim toil , " must be supplanted by creative labor , thrift by sharing , individualism by intelligent altruism , patriotism by internationalism , and charity by justice . " In addition he proposes as elements in a new code of virtues the following : social imagination ? new dreams for old ; co-operation as against competition ; self-fulfillment rather than self-denial . We should prefer to say , only such self-denial as leads to fulfillment for ourselves or others . With this one amendment , high religion would heartily endorse such a revision of the traditional virtues , and would point out that some of the " new " virtues are as old as the Hebrew prophets and Jesus , while others are dictated by the fresh demands of contemporary life . We should also add Emerson 's contribution . When Robert Owen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , Mr. Emerson replied : " You are very external with your evils . Mr. Owen . Let me give you some real mischiefs ? living for show , losing the whole in the particular , indulgence of vital powers in trivialities . " High religion will seek to discern both the internal and the external standards which have betrayed our society into the corruption of its life , and // will endeavor to supplant them by the truer attitudes and motives without which no significant social destiny is possible for our culture . As high religion endeavors to bring into action its special contributions to social regeneration , it finds the practical difficulties intensified by the barricaded character of our social groupings . Every man stands at a common point in a congeries of overlapping social circles . He is born into a particular family which may have erected barriers against other families of the community . He belongs to a racial group which , whether privileged or unprivileged , strong or weak in numbers , feels it must construct defensive barriers against some other race . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , endeavoring to protect its own interests by tariff-walls , armaments , and the intangible but effective barriers of ignorance , prejudice , and propaganda . He may be a member of a religious group that is barricaded against others , Christian against Jew , Catholic against Protestant and so on through the lesser sects . He finds his place in an economic class , the " haves " or the " have-nots , " capital or labor , with all the defenses thrown up for bitter warfare . He gravitates to a social set , the " upper crust " or the " great unwashed , " with fraternities on college campuses and equally exclusive sets , organized or un- // organized , in all communites . He may take his place in a vocational group ? artists , artisans , clerics , journalists , etc. ? throwing up a screen against the alien or inimical spirit of other such groups . Each of these barricaded groups is moved by a common impulse . Within each one men go into a huddle , repeat their secret signals , damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the huddle chanting their themesong , " We are the people , " and lunge at the enemy line . Sometimes this is done in sporting spirit , abiding by the rules of the game . When interests are precious and emotions run high , rules are forgotten and men fly at each other 's throats in senseless orgy . In such a society , what avails even high religion with its ideal of universal brotherhood , its method of love and tolerance , and its plea that man be conformed to the divine character and fellowship ? Can religion keep the integrity of its insights and yet be realistic enough to deal effectively with such a world of estranged relationships ? Not if it spends its energy only in vague yearning , or in mere talk and exhortation . Not unless it works out techniques and programs for implementing its ideals , can religion become a vital force in social redemption . This raises the question as to just what this method of love is when seen in action . Let us see if we can get // a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the process of so changing or redeeming men 's minds , motives , and wills that the higher ideals , such as broth-erhood , may become possible . We have said that it takes issue with commonly accepted methods of re-forming people , in that they trust to changing wrong-doers by imposing suffering on the offender , while the method of love depends upon changing hearts and wills by some one 's caring enough for the enemy or culprit to suffer with him and for him . It is the method of caring and sharing . It is the method of overcoming evil , not by more powerful evil such as violence in the hands of parents , civil authorities , or nations , but by goodness which in our imperfect humanity recognizes that it shares in the guilt of all men and so must share in the punishment . This is a realistic recognition of the truth of Herbert Spencer 's words : " No one can be perfectly free till all are free ; no one can be perfectly moral till all are moral ; no one can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it endorses Eugene V. Debs ' remark : " As long as a single soul is behind prison bars , I too am a prisoner . " The method of love is therefore the method of willing the good of those opposed to us or dependent for life upon us , even when the neces-sary action limits our own rights and privileges . It is putting oneself in the other person 's place and act-ing accordingly . I28 THE METHOD OF LOVE IN ACTION The classic example of the method of love in action is seen in the life and death of Jesus . We call it the way of the cross , because it sets no limits , not even death itself , on how far one may go in expressing concern for others . In the case of Jesus , was it realistic ? Was it effective in an evil and barricaded world ? At first we are tempted to answer , " No . " How seemingly futile such a sacrifice ! How impotent he seemed as he hung upon his cross ! Centuries went by before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hate-possessed world . But further centuries show that no single element in human history has proven so effective in changing men 's hearts , in breaking down pride , arrogance , anger , greed , and hate , and in creating humaneness , mutuality , and brotherliness among men . There we see the power of the " Terrible Meek " to accomplish what no methods of violence and imposed punishment can bring to pass . " He was bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement of our peace was upon him . " There it all was in Isaiah 's picture of the suffering servant , but it waited its full exemplification in Jesus . Christians have made the mistake of according this method too exclusively to Jesus , acclaiming its profound results in his experience , and failing to see that it is a universal principle and method to be accepted and practised by his followers also . Trusting the way of the cross must mean not only trusting the death of Jesus // to save men , but also trusting that method of redemptive love to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it not Jesus himself who insisted that his followers must themselves go by this way , on pain of losing their lives in the more prudent attempt to save them ? What will be the way of life today of one who actually begins to experiment with this method of love , this way of the cross ? ' We might describe his activities as follows : He uses his strength or advantages not to exploit the weak , but to lighten their burdens . He refuses to become rich in a poor world preferring to share with others that they may have a chance . He gives up some of his rights , privileges , rank , security , or comfort , if they can be maintained only by oppression of those to whom such values are denied . He insists on meeting human need , as against the exploiting programs of powerful interests . He puts man above the institutions , even when the institutions may make him suffer for so doing . He confronts wicked men in high places , speaking the truth in love , though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he gets under the burden with the guilty . He experiments with the power of changing others which lies in suffering with them and for them , rather than relying upon the method of making them suffer at his hands . If outworn customs or beliefs hinder his work of love , he ignores them even at the risk of being considered a dangerous radi-130 HOW RADICAL SHALL WE BE ? cal . He stands by new ideals of brotherhood which may not yet be acceptable to the community . He hazards his job , his money , or , if need be , his life for a great cause , such as freedom , truth , or justice . He begins living like a son of God and encourages others to do likewise . Each one of the above statements could be amplified in terms of concrete cases and illustrations ; but the implications are clear enough to suggest that the way of love is no unrealistic or sentimental superfluity ; and that when put into practice it contains just the dynamic needed to redeem society . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , school , church , international relations , and industry , if we are to rescue the true values of human existence . Is it not both more realistic and more effective in the long run than the methods of those impatient idealists and social reformers who belabor their opponents , set group against group , and condone the most intolerant and violent procedures by way of reaching their social goals ? High religion 's method of working for social change always confronts the question of how radical it shall be . This is not the question of whether compromises must be made in order to save its adherents from discomfort , persecution , or ill-fame . Rather it is such questions as these : If we push forward with drastic and radical measures , do we not run the danger of destroy- // ing great values of the old order for the sake of our one new goal ? But if we proceed more slowly , trusting to educational processes and the eventual triumphs of good-will , is there a danger that the hour of crisis will be past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this problem in The Christian Century , one man held that the social crisis of our day calls for the use of dynamite , not whitewash . A second man contended that dynamite is too destructive and that the need is for leaven ; but his description of how the leaven works made it seem so tame , cautious , and ineffectual , that he was accused of sponsoring only whitewash after all , not genuine leaven . If we accept the leaven as our symbol , we must remember that leaven is aggressive , working night and day ; that it is pervasive , working its way through the whole lump ; and that it rapidly changes the whole aspect of the dough in a most amazing way . It would seem necessary to distinguish between social issues whose hour has struck so that there is no time for delay , where only the most prompt and drastic measures can possibly save the life of our world , and those less immediate social issues where time and patience can be trusted to work out the best final results . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues of world peace and economic justice . Here lie the two great fights for freedom with which our generation is confronted , while a close third is the effort to break down 132 HOW RADICAL SHALL WE BE ? interracial hatred and strife . Into these struggles reli-gious people must throw themselves at once and with all the soul-force which they can command . The foes are nationalism and economic greed and racial an-tipathy . They must be combated by the method of love , but by love that is resolute and flaming and sacrificial . It is a strange and tragic sight to see " religious " people glorying in the great fights for freedom which were waged in the past , but approaching these contemporary struggles for freedom with caution or listlessness , if not actually defending war and the old economic order of rugged individualism and the cruelties inflicted on minority racial groups . To meet the social challenge of our day high religion urges its contribution of aroused and unconquerable love , born of its sense of fellowship with God and with man . Its program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middleton Murry in these words : " The king-dom of God is coming now . To become a son of God you must believe you are a son of God . To believe you are a son of God means you must act like a son of God . To act like a son of God means many things ? but chief of all it means this : that you must trust your Father utterly , and behave to every member as to a beloved brother , knowing that he also is a potential son of God . " 6 HIGH RELIGION AND SOCIAL CHANGE In its striving toward the realization of the kingdom of God on earth , high religion intends to prove itself as practical and realistic as any non-religious social idealist could desire . To this end it proposes to keep clear its vision of God and His purposes , to maintain its loyalty to the ways of redemptive love , and to lay hold upon the divine resources of power and patience , courage and fortitude , needed for the task . It is prepared to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maintain the high traditions of good religion by working steadfastly on the side of human rights , even through darkness when the dawn seems long delayed . We stand in the midst of a generation at the crisis . Behind us a world falls away , a social order which we loved and trusted overmuch , making us blind to the subtle causes of its disintegration . Before us a new order struggles to be born , a civilization as yet largely without character , with no guarantees , save what high religion may bring to it , that it will be in any wise superior to the old . But high religion reveals the causes of our past failures , sitting in judgment upon the shabbiness of our characters and our institutions ; yet offering the clue to that new life which alone is worth the making . It is ours to follow that clue to the utmost in our own living and to build its gift of divine life into the structure of the new society . 134 HOW RADICAL SHALL WE BE ? " You that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world at strife , And trust that out of night and death shall rise The dawn of ampler life ; " Rejoice , whatever anguish rend your heart , That God has given you , for a priceless dower , To live in these great times and have your part In Freedom 's crowning hour . " That you may tell your sons who see the light High in the heavens , their heritage to take : ? I saw the powers of darkness put to flight ! I saw the morning break ! ' " 7 135 Being " Religious " without a Religion Shall We Stand by the Church ? Values of Organized Religious Life Can We Transcend Institutionalism ? The Prophetic Spirit within the Church CHAPTER VII CAN HIGH RELIGION BE ORGANIZED ? Professor Dewey advocates the substitution of the " religious attitude " in place of adherence to any one of the " religions " which now exist or any that might be newly born . He feels that " religions now prevent , be-cause of their weight of historic encumbrances , the religious quality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is appropriate to present conditions , intellectual and moral . " 1 He rightly contends that one can not have religion , but only a re-ligion , which immediately introduces limitations . For any given religion will inevitably be organized and in-stitutionalized , and can include only those who accept its interpretations , beliefs , and forms . Those who can not accept any one of the existing religions are thus classed as " non-religious , " a fact which Professor Dewey de-plores . He proposes , therefore , " a common faith " for all men who might have the religious attitude , which he describes as " the unification of the self through al-legiance to inclusive ideal ends , which imagination pre-sents to us and to which the human will responds as worthy of controlling our desires and choices .
