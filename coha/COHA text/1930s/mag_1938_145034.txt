Bright enough to leave a long silvery reflection on a dark river is the monster planet Jupiter now shining in the southeastern sky . Three hundred times larger than the earth , containing more matter than all the other planets combined , Jupiter takes twelve years to complete its ponderous revolution around the sun . Far from the centre of the solar system , Jupiter receives little heat , has a small core of solid rock , surrounded by a frozen ocean , thousands of fathoms deep . Thick clouds hide from astronomers the furious storms that rack the planet , scarring its face with wide bands of purple , red and brown . <P> Four satellites , large as our moon , swing rapidly around Jupiter , all keeping the same face towards the master star , but each night displaying themselves in a different arrangement . Sometimes they disappear behind the planet , sometimes they fade into its shadow , or rush in front of it . In 1610 , equipped with only a two-foot wooden telescope , Galileo discovered Satellites I-IV . On a clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses . Of the five other faint satellites . Satellite V was discovered by Edward Emerson Barnard at the University of California 's Lick Observatory in 1892 , VI and VII by C. D. Perrine also at Lick in 1904-1905 , and VIII by Melotte at Greenwich in 1908 . Discovery of the satellites was not only a telescopic feat , but a matter of practical importance to astronomy . As far back as 1675 , Ole Roemer , Danish astronomer , noting that the eclipses of Satellite I varied with the distance of the earth from Jupiter , discovered the motion of light , and made the first calculation of its velocity . <P> In 1914 , Seth Barnes Nicholson , keen-eyed young graduate student at Lick Observatory , sighted Satellite IX . Last week the Carnegie Institution of Washington announced that Dr. Nicholson , still in California looking for new moons , had discovered dim , elusive Satellites X and XI with Mt . Wilson 's 100-inch telescope. - " This discovery will rank as one of the great advances in astronomy of 1938 , " stated Director James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no hope of observing the new satellites except with the greatest telescopes . " <P> *En route to Palomar Mountain , Calif , are the 48 structural steel parts of the giant 200-inch telescope which will bring to focus four times as much light as the 100-inch telescope , make visible at least two billion stars now unseen .
