In 1936 Dictator Josef Stalin cracked down on Russia 's noisy modernist composers . He accused them of " bourgeois degeneracy , " confiscated their compositions , told them to stop imitating the sound of Soviet steel mills and cement-mixers , get themselves a few singable tunes . Since then , presumably , the party line in musical Russia has been all nightingale and lark . But because the machinery of the Soviet Musical Bureau ( which owns all manuscripts , controls all performance rights ) needs oil in its joints , not many examples of this New Musical Policy have been heard outside Russia . <P> Last week a few lark-notes of new-style Russian music were heard in the U. S. : the overture to an opera , Gulsara , by Reinhold Moritzovich Gliere , veteran Soviet composer and professor at the Moscow Conservatory . No streamlined Eastern orchestra gave it its first U. S. hearing , but the wide-awake , six-year-old Kansas City Philharmonic under cigar-puffing U. S. Conductor Karl Krueger . Conductor Krueger 's first cellist , Frank Sykora , onetime pupil of Composer Gliere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience of 2,500 Kansas Citizens turned out to hear the overture , and agreed that Joe Stalin had done his stuff : the Gliere piece was engagingly tuneful , richly orchestrated , satisfactorily oldfashioned.
