txt The city and the District Attorney 's office took steps yesterday to expedite the search for missing Supreme Court Justice Joseph Force Crater as " tips " which had spurred the police to renewed activity proved worthless . Mayor Walker , on behalf of the city , requested a special meeting of the Board of Aldermen to appropriate a $5,000 reward for information as to the whereabouts of Judge Crater . Simultaneously , District Attorney Crain sought to start a John Doe proceeding before a city magistrate , at which an " open , public , systematic and thorough investigation " of the jurist 's disappearance " shall be instituted and prosecuted . " Mr. Crain , in a letter to Chief Magistrate Corrigan , requested that this inquiry be started next Monday , but last night Judge Corrigan said that he doubted whether he fiaci the authority to comply with Mr , Crain 's request . Mara Admits Cashing Two Checks . These two developments came toward the end of another day of fruitless search , during which Joseph L. Mara , son of the Tammany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his previous declaration And admitted that he had endorsed and cashed both the $3,000 and the $2,150 checks which Judge Crater made out to " cash " on Aug. 6 , the day of his disappearance . Mara had previously denied that he had endorsed the $3,000 check , and detectives had been working on the possibility that the endorsement might have been a forgery . Mayor Walker requested Aldermanic President Joseph V. to call a special meeting of the board , which is not regularly scheduled to meet until next October . Mr. said that he would send word to the members of the board at once , and the meeting will probably be held next Monday . The money for the reward will be obtained by the sale of bonds , it was said . If the reward proposed by the Mayor is voted , the amount offered for information as to Justice Crater 's whereabouts will total $7,500 , a reward of $2,500 for similar information having been announced by The Evening World . Mayor 's Action Unprecedented . The Mayor 's action is without precise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes that the reward can be legally appropriated , though heretofore such rewards have only been offered for fugitives from justice . It was pointed out by those close to the administration yesterday that the Mayor has not been unaware of what he is said to consider as intimations and innuendos which have been circulated since Judge Crater 's disappearance hinting that those high in Tammany have been conniving with the judge in his " disappearance " and are not anxious to see him return . The Mayor 's attitude , it was said , is that he , personally , and the City Administration are eager and anxious to have Judge Crater found and brought back , and as an earnest of such an attitude he is anxious to have the reward offered . It is not expected that there will be much opposition to the Mayor 's wishes , and if the measure is passed the only test to its legality would be a taxpayer 's suit . District Attorney Crain announced his request for John Doe proceedings through his chief assistant , Albert B. Unger . Mr. Crain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , L. I. , instructed Mr. Unger yesterday to confer with Chief Magistrate . Corrigan to make arrangements to begin the hearings as soon as possible . Mr. Unger conferred with Mr. Corrigan yesterday afternoon and discussed with him the legal aspects of the case . Following this conference and one with the Mayor at . the City Hall the Chief Magistrate wrote a letter to Mr. Crain , promising to cooperate " if there is any legal way to do so . " Legality of Inquiry Doubted . Chief Magistrate Corrigan said after the conferences that he still held to a belief of long standing that all John Doe proceedings were illegal , and that he felt that the magistrates ' courts do not have the authority to hold a proceeding of this kind when no ? defendant is named and . it is not known whether or not any definite crime has been committed . Soe of the leaders of the New York bar , in commenting last night upon Mr. Crain 's request , agreed with Magistrate Corrigan , declaring it to be illegal for a magistrate 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an inquiry no defendant is named and no definite crime is charged . If Justice Crater is still alive and has been forcibly detained , the only crime applicable , kidnapping , is punishable by imprisonment for from ten to fifty years , it was pointed out . . Mr. Crane 's statement follows : " It is. scarcely believable that the efforts now being put forth to ascertain the whereabouts of Justice Joseph Force Crater will fail to do so . But it is to the public interest , inasmuch as they may fail , that prompt steps be taken to start a John Doe proceeding . before a city magistrate , in which an open , public , systematic and thorough investigation shall be instituted and prosecuted . It will have for its purpose the discovery of the circumstances attending the disappearance of Judge Crater and the ascertainment of the place where he , is to be found , or ? terday gave the police new hope of finding a tangible clue . knownMara , . knon as a " confidential man " . for Justice Crattr , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cashed a check ? for $2,150 drawn on the Empire .

The currency which Mara drew from the two ' banks when he ? cashed the checks for the justice ' was in bills of small denomination , the commissioner said , so that all hope of trailing the missing jurist in this manner was abandoned . In the meantime the police investigated another series of ' fruitless " tips " which sent detectives to Lake George , Troy , Vermont and Atlantic City . Detective Frank Phillips Went to Lake George and reported that - assertions that Judge Crater.had been seen there were baseless . Phillips also trailed  --  down rumors in Troy and in Fairhaven and Whitehall , . Vt. , without ' finding anything of value .

" He added that no clues " point to the city . " He also discounted all reports of Judge Crater 's activities on Broadway as of little help , to the investigation . He said that all these clues had been run down some time ago and proved to be worthless . Hiram C. Todd , special prosecutor detailed by Attorney General Ward to ? prosecute the .
