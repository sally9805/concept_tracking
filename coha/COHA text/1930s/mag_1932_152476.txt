In Warsaw everyone knows that Poland will go to war the moment any nation menaces her corridor to the sea . The greatest living Pole restated this axiom of his nation in Manhattan last week . Not for 13 years has Ignace Jan Paderewski been Premier of Poland . He and Poland 's present Dictator , eccentric Marshal Pilsudski , are on barely civil terms . But every Pole backed Pianist Paderewski when he exclaimed : <P> " Do not believe those fortune tellers who predict a return to prosperity provided the Corridor be given back to Prussia ! That is a tale for children . A new partition of Poland would be an evil deed . <P> " What would it mean to us if we permitted such a change in the status of that territory ? It would immediately paralyze the economic life of the sixth largest State in Europe . It would deprive our country of its own direct communication with the countries of Europe . It would reduce our free and sovereign State to an impotent and pitiable land between Prussia and Russia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do not wish to be crippled and enslaved again ! <P> " We will not accept so monstrous an injury , no matter by whom inflicted . The territory restored to us is justly ours and we will stand by it . We are peaceful and peace-loving people . We need peace more than any other country in the whole world . Nevertheless , if a war-and I am speaking now not as an official person ( for I 'm a plain citizen now , I hold no official position ) - if a war should be thrust upon us by formal declaration or by surprise we shall defend ourselves . " <P> That Poland might lose such a war , Pianist Paderewski readily admitted . <P> " The fortunes of war are capricious , " he quietly said . " Remember that there are now more than four million Communists in Germany . We have our Communists in Poland , too . Supposing the war imposed on us was disastrous , the national government was overthrown ? The Communists , having nothing to lose , everything to gain , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has protected Western Europe . What would then happen ? It is too atrocious to imagine ! " <P> As early as 1910 Pianist Paderewski , then at the early zenith of his musical career , proclaimed : " The vision of a strong and independent Poland has always been the lodestar of my existence . Its realization is still the great aim of my life ! " <P> Directly the War broke , M. Paderewski subordinated all private interests to the struggle for Polish liberty , raised money for the cause with his fingers , finally brought President Wilson to declare ( Jan. 22 , 1917 ) for " a united , independent and autonomous Poland . " <P> Thereafter M. Paderewski pushed the organization of Polish military training camps in the U. S. and Canada , raised a picked Polish National Guard of 22,000 Polish volunteers . With the sudden collapse of Germany he rushed to Warsaw , became Premier and " made " Poland in the sense that he obtained her recognition as a nation by all the Great Powers . <P> Later the very military groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exile of silence , reserve and dignity . His utterance last week was characteristically entitled " Poland &; Peace . "
