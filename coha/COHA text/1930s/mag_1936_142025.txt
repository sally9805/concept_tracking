Into a Los Angeles court one day last summer marched California 's Insurance Commissioner Samuel L. Carpenter Jr . Within 45 minutes he emerged to announce the successful reorganization of Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co. , biggest life company on the West Coast with $215,000,000 in assets , $636,000,000 in life policies ( TIME , Aug. 24 ) . This looked more like a coup than a reorganization , an impression which was sharpened by the fact that none except those in the know were aware that the 68-year-old institution was in hot water . Upshot was a proper bedlam of litigation , investigation and recrimination that has been making California headlines ever since . <P> Promptly transferred to another court , the 45-minute reorganization was reopened , Commissioner Carpenter revising and refiling his plan , although the company remained in his hands . Last week , after six weeks of open hearings , in competition with another plan advanced by Giannini interests , the Carpenter plan was approved by Los Angeles ' Superior Judge Henry M. <P> Willis . <P> Pacific Mutual 's troubles originated with noncancelable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The old management has been accused of favoritism ( bad loans to good friends ) , mismanagement ( unwarranted dividend payments ) and plain skulduggery ( fraudulent annual reports and misuse of funds in stock speculation ) . None of these suspicions has been officially confirmed , although the Pacific Mutual case still has the attention of the Department of Justice , the Securities &; Exchange Commission and a local grand jury . But whatever the sins of the management may have been , the gravest was its stubborn adherence to a type of policy which continued to be unprofitable in spite of six successive premium increases . <P> Largely because of low premiums and the abnormally high rate of disability payments , the insurance examiners felt it imperative to boost Pacific 's various reserve accounts by more than $23,000,000 , an accounting move which made the company legally , if not commercially , insolvent . <P> That was what finally brought the intervention of Commissioner Carpenter . <P> Under the Carpenter plan a new company will take over the old company 's entire insurance business , leaving the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disability policies . Most of the legal excitement in the hearings was over the treatment of the " non-can " policyholders , who will get only from 20% to 90% of what they bargained for depending on the policy and premium rate . The " non-cans " think this amounts to deprivation of property without due process . Under the plan they may eventually ( 1951 ) have their claims restored to par as earnings increase . <P> Another thing that annoys the " non-cans " is that the old stockholders were not completely washed out . ( Pacific Mutual is actually a stock company . ) The Carpenter plan provides for future mutualization if the policyholders wish to bail out the old stockholders for $3,000,000.
