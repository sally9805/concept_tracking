GIRL BY THE RIVER A STORY BY LOWRY CHARLES WIMBERLY R VER fishing is seldom good on a fall day , or so Mart had said . He had said too that the wind was from the wrong direction . He was doubtless right , for it was already close to sundown and we had caught only four or five shiners , none of them big enough to keep . The smaller ones we had cut up for bait , the others I had thrown back into the river . The people below us were n't having any luck either ; so when they began bringing in their lines , Mart said we had just as well bring ours in too . There must have been a dozen men and women and as many children in the outfit  --  for outfit it was , the women loud-mouthed with their yelling and swearing at the children , the men laughing and talking over a black jug they kept passing back and forth . I was glad enough to see them get their things together and go straggling off through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I noticed a girl down along the bank , just a little below where they had been . She was pole-fishing , and had , apparently , just now jerked her line out of the water . Anyway , there it was , caught in the top of a hickory sapling . She sat there on the hank , tugging on the pole for a bit ; then she got up , pulled the sapling over , and tried to disentangle the line . But she gave it up after a minute or two and let the sapling spring back , carrying the shortbamboo pole with it , the line snarling worse than ever , so that the pole hung free of the ground . I tossed aside a magazine I had brought along . " I thought she was with those people , " I said . We could still hear the shouts of the children far off in the woods . " I thought so too , " Mart said , " but she must have come by herself . " To tell the truth , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it was probably only the idea of her being alone on the river that made rue notice her now . She did n't appear to be much more than a child  --  about fourteen , I should sayyellow-haired and bare-legged . Evidently she saw some fun in bending the sapling over and watching it jerk the pole this way and that . Anyhow , she finally took hold of the pole , drew back on it as far as she could , then let go of it . This time the spring of the hickory was enough to snap the line and shoot the pole clear out into the river , where it disappeared for a moment , then flashed its yellow length up out of the water , and went floating downstream . The girl stood watching it . " If she was with that gang , " I said , " they should have known better than to go away and leave her . " Mart reached into a paper sack beside him , brought out a big apple , and bit into it . " She probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we 'd better be starting for home . " I turned toward the girl . The pole 's floating away must have given her an idea , for she was on her hands and knees beside a Little pile of leaves and was dropping , from the bank 's edge , Ieaf after leaf into the water , until there was a bright-colored procession of them drifting downstream . But after all , I thought , it was only a tiny parade of brightness when one viewed the great sweep of the murky river . It must have been nearly a mile across to the Illinois shore , which looked barren and desolate , its mud flats relieved by only an occasional touch of autumn color . " It 's as lonely as the grave out here , " I said . " That 's what I like about it , " Mart said . " But there comes something . " It was a boat , up the river a way . There were two men in it , one rowing , the other sitting in the stern . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the oars , only made things seem lonelier . " Maybe they 're coming for that kid you 're worrying about , " Mart laughed . He tossed the apple core over his shoulder . There was a chance they might be , for when they were opposite us the boat turned in slightly toward our side . But they were still pretty far from shore when they passed the girl . They saw her though , the man in the stern  --  bareheaded and moon-faced  --  pointing her out to the one rowing . I could hear them talking , but the girl apparently did n't hear them . At any rate , she did n't look up . She was lying on her stomach now , still watching the water . The boat went on downstream , the man in the stern looking back until they were out of sight below a little island . They must have seen us , for we were sitting not far from the girl , but after they had disappeared I wished I had made sure by calling out to them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to his left and pulled on a throw line . " Why does n't that kid go on home ? " I said . " A kid that age has n't any sense , " he said . " Anyhow , the chances are she belongs in one of the shacks we saw along the river . " He let go of the line . " That kind can usually take care of themselves . " " But what 's she up to out here by herself ? " I went on . " Cripes , " Mart said . " She 's up to what any kid would be up to . But we 'd better be getting back to the car . " " I 'm not leaving as long as that kid 's out here alone , " I said . Mart did n't like that and said as much . He was remembering , doubtless , that it had been I , and not he , who had been talking all afternoon about getting back to the car . We had left the car a mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventy-mile drive ahead of us . " I do n't imagine she 'll be staying much longer , " I said , But the girl gave no signs of leaving . She was sitting up now  --  her feet tucked beneath her , her hands clasped at the back of her head . In a moment though her hands were in her lap and one foot out a little beyond the bank 's edge . Then she brought her foot back and pushed on the edge of the bank until a pretty big chunk of it went splashing into the water . " She 'll be going in herself if she 's not careful , " Mart said . " The bank 's weak all along here . " The girl looked our way , and after a bit she called to us , her voice clear and easily heard . " Catching anything ? " she said . " Not a thing , " I called back , but she kept looking , as though she had n't heard , as though I had n't answered her . Or perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ string of fish . She could n't be expecting that though if she had heard me . I was about to call again when she turned , and , as before , sat looking out over the river . " Whose kid do you suppose she is ? " Mart said . " She appears to be friendly enough . " He laughed a little . But I believe he felt as I did . There 's something about a river , especially toward nightfall , that makes one fed that way . Or perhaps it is n't so much the river itself as the people one finds along a river  --  people one has never seen before , appearing unexpectedly from nowhere and then as unexpectedly disappearing . Like the two men in the boat  --  the one moon-faced and squat , the other , as I recalled him now , thin and vulture-beaked and slouching over the oars , which , as he dropped down toward the island , rose and fell like wide , lazy wings . Who were they ? And what had become of them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a chance they had n't . They might have tied up at the foot of the island . The island was heavily wooded and closer to our shore than to the Illinois side . The men might now be up at the head of it , watching from the trees and waiting for us to go . Or they might not be there at all . Still , one could n't tell . That was the trouble . One had no way of telling . The girl got up and came along the bank . I was in hopes that she was setting out for home , wherever that was . But she came only a little way , stopping under a big oak , with a long grape vine hanging from one of its branches . She went up the vine hand over hand until she was nearly to the branch . Then she let herself down and , catching the vine well up from the ground , took a run and swung herself out over the water . The bank made a little Muff there , some fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from under the tree you could see her bare legs flashing in the sunlight . And as she swung out again the wind caughther dress and you could see the whiteness of her legs well above her knees . You could see , too , a little shower of red and yellow leaves  --  some of them falling on the bank , some drifting down to the water and floating away . " She 's crazy , " Mart said . " That vine might break any minute . She 's a good-sized chunk of a kid . " Out she went , then back again , with the leaves still coming down , and you thought that at least one of them might catch in the gold-yellow of her hair . That 's what you wanted to see happen . It was the sort of thing , that is , that ought to happen on a day like this . But you felt too that the girl should n't have been there at all  --  not , that is , with the lowering sun even now reddening the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with their coarse voices , their big bodies , and their yelling children . " There she goes again , " I said . I called down to her , " Hey , you better stay off that vine . " I thought she must have heard me , but she did n't look our way . She stopped swinging though and stood there , her right hand still holding the vine , holding it at a place pretty well above her head . But , as I say , she had n't , when I called , looked in our direction ; so I was n't sure after all that she had heard me . I got up and sauntered down toward her , stopping before I had gone very far and ready , should she turn , to make a pretense of looking after a line . Mart had called her a good-sized chunk of a kid . But she was n't chunky at all . There was a slimness and tallness about her , making you feel that had she wanted to she could have lit out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she stream out behind her . I glanced to- and run like a deer . Her hair was to run as fast as she could it would ward the river , thinking I heard voices . But there was no one . I looked down toward the island , then went back to Mart . " Did you hear anyone talking ? " I said . " 1 thought I heard voices . " Mart took out another apple and began shining it on the sleeve of his denim coat . " I was humming a tune , " he said . " Maybe that was it . " " Well , I wish that kid would get the hell out of here , " I said . " It 'll be good and dark before long . " Mart put the apple into his pocket and brought in one of the throw lines . " Forget it , " he said . " She can take care of herself . Anyway , we ca n't stay here all night watching somebody else 's kid . " There was nothing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hook and began flirting itself back toward the water . Mart caught it , pulled off its pinchers , and baited the upper hook with it . He tossed the fine back into the river , the current tautening the heavy cord and slanting it downstream in the direction of the girl . The girl drew the vine back , almost to the tree trunk , then in a moment was again far out over the water , kicking her legs as she went , trying in that way to make distance . This time the wind took her hair , streaming it against the sun , the sunlight giving it a quick flame . But in a second she was back under the tree , her hair fallen about her , and something of the light gone from it . I called to her again . " You better watch your step with that vine . " But she paid no attention . From far away across the river came the whistle of a train , long-drawn-out and lonesome . Then after a little it came again , lonesomer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm going down there and tell her to stay off that vine , " I said . " I 'd keep away from her , " Mart said . He finished rolling a cigarette . " You ca n't tell ; some of her folks may behanging around somewhere . Anyhow , she can take care of herself . " But I noticed that he began watching her pretty sharply . " You said that once before , " I said . " But if the vine was to break she would go into twenty feet of water . " I started down toward her . She was still holding to the vine , but was looking up into the tree , her head back , her hair fallen away from her face , leaving her small features in clear profile . She began shaking the vine , and I saw a squirrel run out to the end of the branch . She said something or other to it  --  the squirrel flicking its red brush and beginning to chatter . I stopped within a few feet of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And as I stood there I felt that perhaps I should n't have come , that even now I ought to steal away . But the squirrel came scampering back along the branch , and in turning to follow it she saw me . I had thought she might be startled at sight of someone standing there where a moment before no one had been . But she did n't seem to be startled at all . " Hello , " I said . She let go of the vine , moving away from it a few steps . She was scarcely as tall as I had thought , but the slimness was there with its suggestion of fleetness . She smiledalittle . " Where 's your fish ? " she said . Then , before I could speak , the smile was gone , and I noticed at the left corner of her mouth a slight droop that did n't somehow belong there . " We did n't have much luck , " I said . " But I came to tell you you 'd better look out for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She did n't say anything to that , but in her whole bearing there was an utter stillness , as of one listening closely for a distant sound or like one trying to catch near at hand a whispered syllable . And she looked at me with an intensity that made me turn away . I took hold of the vine . " Do n't you think it 's risky swinging out over the river ? " I said . Still she did n't say anything , but moved over a bit until again she was gazing directly at me , her head a little to one side , her right hand drawing a lock of hair over her shoulder and holding it across her breast . I brought all my weight down on the vine . Not that I was heavy , but I was heavier than she . The vine made a scraping noise where , above us , it crossed the branch , and it made throughout its length little crisp creaking sounds . I tried the vine again , and a leaf fluttered down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding it in her left hand , and began to twirl it by the stem between thumb and finger . " This vine is n't any too strong , " I said . " You better keep off it . What do you say ? " But she did n't say a thing , and I knew now that she was not hearing me . I raised my voice . " There 's twenty feet of water out there . " But as I spoke I felt a deep stillness about us , as though no one were speaking . The chattering of the squirrel . The sound of the river . My voice . Mart up the bank , calling and saying he had made a catch . Sounds she did n't hear . The tiny creakings of the vine . The voices of the men in the boat awhile ago . She had n't heard them . The slight droop at the corner of her mouth . It was there because she was deaf , not hearing . That was what had touched her mouth with sadness , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here she was on the river , striving , it might be , against her sorrow  --  trying to be a child , doing what she could to make play in a soundless world . A faint color rose in the light tan of her cheeks , and the blueness of her eyes was not , I thought , as unclouded as before . She wanted perhaps to tell me she could n't hear . But I would n't let her tell me that . Iran with the vine , swinging to the edge of the bank , and when , to stop myself , I brought my feet down pretty solidly , some of the bank gave way , making a heavy splash in the water . I turned and shook my head , but went on talking too , as though she could hear . She smiled , thinking perhaps that I was afraid to swing clear out or that the bank 's caving off had frightened me . Or maybe she understood what I meant , realized that I was afraid for her and not for myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she ought to stay away from the river , that she ought not to be there by herself . I thought again of the two men and of how the moonfaced one had pointed her out to the other where she lay on the bank . I glanced at her long , slim legs , thinking how swift they might be , but thinking too that they might not be swift enough . I looked at her face again , noting the sadness of it , and I wanted to put my arm about her and take her away from the river . And why should n't I , I asked myself . Or Mart and I. Why should n't we take her home , wherever that might be ? But I knew Mart would laugh at the idea . I let go of the vine , and she made a quick run for it , and in a second was out beyond the bank , kicking her feet , as before , to make distance . She was beautiful , out there over the water . Beautiful with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her swift feet rustling the fallen leaves , and out again past the high bank . And yet no leaf in the gold of her hair . That too , I thought , was denied her . And no laughter as she flashed by me . Still , she was taking pride perhaps in her little flight , showing me how far she could go , and thinking , it might be , that I , who could hear the river , was afraid to swing out over it . But she , who could not hear , was unafraid of the deep water . Unafraid , too , by herself along the river , with night coming on , and no one in sight that she knew . I , standing there , wanting to catch her as she came flying back toward me but knowing I must n't catch her , must n't touch her . Wondering who she was and why she was there alone , but knowing that I must go and leave her , that I could n't stay . Hearing Mart 's voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling again . And so , though she could n't hear , I said good-by . But she must have seen that I was going , for she stopped swinging , and standing there beside the vine she told me good-by . And I noticed again that touch of affliction in her face , a quaint sadness I recalled having seen in the eyes , about the mouth , of a tiny , old-fashioned lady , long since dead . Then she smiled  --  smiled , I thought , for me rather than herself . But for an instant the sadness was gone , and she was a child once more . " Good-by , " I said again , knowing she could n't hear , though the stillness of her seemed to be listening . I went along the bank toward Mart . He was holding up the fish . It was a channel cat , a big fellow . I glanced back at the girl . She was looking up into the tree again and shaking the vine . Probably trying to chase the squirrel along the branch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't see the squirrel . Doubtless , it was gone , leaving her there alone , and I wished that she too would go . I wished she would go and never come back . But she would come back , again and again . She would play , as now , until after sundown along the river and swing far out beyond the bank . People expecting to find her there day after day . People outstaying one another , and watching her , and she unafraid of the deep water , unafraid of the people . She should have lookedstartled when I had come upon her awhile ago . Those swift feet of hers ' But she could n't hear . And she was too unafraid . Unafraid of the river , unafraid of death itself perhaps . The loneliness of her desiring death and clinging only lightly to life , as though life were something she could easily let go of , just as she might , some day , when she was out over the water .. . " Ai n't that a beauty ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " It sure is , " I said . It was odd , though , to see him so happy over his catch , with the dark coming on and the river gray and dismal . " They 're just beginning to tune up , " he said . And it appeared that he was right , for it could n't have been two minutes before he was bringing in another channel cat half again as big as the other . He put it on the stringer , and was telling me to hand him some more bait , when there came a quick splash from down along the bank . I turned to glance toward the girl , expecting to see her still there in the dusk , but she was gone , and the vine was still swinging a little as though she had just now Ieft it . " Good Godl " Mart said , " What was that ? " But even as he was saying it , I had started running toward where the girl had been . Then I was standing at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hearing the deep murmur of the river . And all at once I wanted to scream , to tell Mart to come quick . But here he was now beside me and gripping my arm . Then he let go of my arm and laughed . He bent over and felt along the edge of the bank , pushing on it a little , and I could hear the dirt striking the water . He stood up . " It was only the bank caving off , " he said . " We 're crazy ; the kid 's half way home by now . " " But the vine was still swinging , " I said . " That could have been the wind , " he said . " Or you were just seeing things . " I wanted to believe him , wanted to be glad because the whiteness was leaving his face , and the color coming back . But I left him and ran along the bank , stopping every now and then to look over into the water , but seeing nothing and telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the bank caving off , and that the girl was on her way home . I left the river and ran through the woods , looking for her everywhere , thinking I might see her all of a sudden just ahead of me , then thinking I would n't be seeing her and that the darkening woods had made her suddenly afraid and that she had started running , running like the wind . I called to her , forgetting she could n't hear . Then I remembered , and quit calling . And after awhile I was back again under the oak . But Mart was not there . He was up the bank , bending over a line or something . He turned toward me , a cigarette glowing between his lips . " For God 's sake , come on , " he said . " Let 's get going . " I looked at the vine . It was moving a little in the wind , but not so much as awhile ago when I thought the girl had just left it . But Mart was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went up where he was , helped him bring in the lines , and listened to his carrying on over the big fish . Then after awhile we reached the car , neither of us saying anything about the girl . That is , we did n't say anything about her until we were well toward home , but I wonder , now , that we had n't thought to say it before . " If the kid had fallen into the water , " Mart said , " she would have yelled for help . " " Maybe and maybe not , " I said . " What do you mean ? " he asked . He slowed the car down a little . " Oh , nothing much , " I said . " Maybe you 're right . " There was no way , I thought , of making him see what I meant . So I did n't say any more , but went on thinking about the girl . She had been leaning against the tree , the last I saw of her  --  getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out past the bank . And now , as I rode along with Mart , both of us silent , I pictured her as making a run with the vine and swinging out , once more , far over the water , not this time as a child but as one touched with weariness and affliction . And I fancied that perhaps the weariness had made her let go of the vine and that she had fallen into the strong current , her hair brightening , for a moment , the dark water . She would have cried out , Mart had said . But I do n't believe she would have cried out , would have called for help . She would have seen rather that there was nothing we could have done . She would have known that it was only in the river that she would be finding the help she had long been seeking .
