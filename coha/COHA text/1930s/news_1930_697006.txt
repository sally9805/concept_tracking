txt Trading in the two-hour session at the week end was disturbed by heavy selling in many sections of the list . Mercantile reviews were characterized by a moderately optimistic tone . reporting increasing signs of business revival . However , traders were disappointed by the failure of pivotal shares to sustain the recent . recovery , and this factor actuated substantial liquidation of speculative Unsettlement was heightened by continued pressure on special groups , like the radio shares , and individual issues , notably Fox Film A. 1 ... atter was subjected to another Aood of selling on news of the application for receivership in the federal court of this district by the protective committee representing the minority interest in the Class A stock . American &; Foreign Power , Columbia Gas and other representative ' utilities also broke sharply , reflecting temporary impairment of technical conditions created by recent demonstrations in this department .

However , a slightly better tone developed in the market as a whole toward the end of the abbreviated session , and bullish activities were resumed in the tobacco shares . Active demand for stocks of this class was stimulated by more stabilized conditions in the retail cigarette trade , as well as by the fact that fuller reflection of the recent price advance by manufacturers will be found in earnings during the current quarter . Americas Tobacco staged a brisk uprush into new high ground on the movement . while Liggett &; Myers , R. J. Reynolds . and Lorillard also reached the best levels of the current advance on good-sized dealings . ? ? ? Receivership for Roister Radio and recent severe declines in Grigsby-Grunow and Crosley have reflected conditions in the radio industry which is Suffering from growing pains very much as did the automobile business In its early days . The industry is fraught with rapid fire new inventions that as often as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patent difficulties which have cluttered up the courts to such an extent that manufacturers , distributors and small jobbers do not know where they stand- Larger corporations are exacting tribute on their patents and smaller companies with little to sell but their alleged valuable patents . are doing little else but litigate to make a living . Eventually . the leaders of the industry feel that some sort of interchange of patents for all hands will come about so that this phase of the situation can be obviated to some extent . Overproduction is also a constant ill and in this matter few have escaped in the last six months . Besides the break in the market helped to aggravate this latter situation and today many companies find themselves with large unsold stocks on hand with a falling market to dispose of them In . It is pretty certain that 1930 will be a readjustment year for radio with many companies spending the first few months of the year In marketing inventories at little or no profit . ? ? ? Wide price reductions in crude oil appear to be bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and may well work out as a constructive step . With a substantial cut In crude yield brought about , it is conceivable that old prices may be restored . There is precedent for this in the California fields where the big price cut of late 1929 never became effective because production was immediately curtailed . Though the producing branch of the business did laudable work last year in its conservation efforts , and restricted yield far below potential , it apparently was not sufficient . Now the plans of Oklahoma operators alone will reduce yield in that state by 100.000 barrels daily , or close to 15% . With Texas and Kansas operators preparing further restriction of yield , production in the midcontinent should shortly decline sharply and may easily clear up the situation in a short time . It appears to those on the outside that with the producing end of the business so quickly grasping its obligation to cut down its yield , the refining end of the business might very well follow the lead and cut down its operations to discontinue the wide oversupply of gasoline resulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crude oil is gasoline in another form and the overrettning of gasoline reduces the money realized on gasoline which , in turn . measures the money which can be paid for the crude oil . Developments in the stock market since early last autumn have exercised a deterring influence on consolidation projects in merchandising lines . One result of the break has been the abandonment of plans to merge Hershey ' Chocolate with liraft Phenix Cheese and Colgate . It is now considered likely that " Kraft Phenix eventually will be taken to the fold of Standard Brands . Advantages of such a combination would be principally in the large savings which might be effected in distributing cost . Estimates or Kraft 's marketing expenditures approximate $20,000,000 , compared with an annual turnover in the neighborhood of $100,000.000 . Interests who have made a study of the situation contend that Standard Brands could save 515,000,000 of this amount by eliminating duplication of facilities .

" As business in Canada has little direct concern with conditions in this . country , it is reasonable to look for better results there in 1930 than in 1929 if crops are nornfal , " says 3 . H. Oliphant &; Co . " Last year , owing to drought , there was a poor harvest of wheat . On the basis that bad news is behind . Canadian Pacific should do better marketwise . Late 1929 earnings were sharply down , but partly because wheat shipments were held for higher prices . anal so will come subsequently . Regular $10 dividends are undoubtedly safe .
