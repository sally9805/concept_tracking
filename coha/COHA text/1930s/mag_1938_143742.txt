The basic income of the average golf professional is derived from the sale of golf balls . If he is employed by a country club of average wealth and size , the average professional 's revenue from teaching , the sale of golf equipment and the concession for shining the members ' clubs amounts to about $5,000 a year . In the winter months , when the majority of the 2,000,000 golfers in the U. S. turn their hands to bridge and the radio , the majority of the jobless professionals go south . Some are hired to accompany rich club members to their winter playgrounds . Some find comfortable berths at flourishing hotels . But a goodly portion embark on one of the most extraordinary tours in the realm of sport . <P> Beside professional golfers , only rodeo contestants are willing to travel some 8,000 miles , pay their own expenses , receive no guarantee of being a dollar richer when they return . Every year some 300 trouping golfers jaunt from town to town , from coast-to-coast , making three-day stands in a carefully planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map ) . Starting at sporty Pinehurst with the Mid-South Open in November No. 1 on the map , they move down the coast one jump ahead of the thermometer , spend the month of December shuttling around Greater Miami and Nassau tournaments this year : $10,000 Miami-Biltmore Open ( No. 2 ) , $3,500 Nassau Open ( No. j ) , $3,000 Miami Open ( No. 4 ) , $4,000 Holly-wood Beach Hotel Open ( No. 5 ) , swing over to California for a midwinter stand , then return to Florida this year via the $5,000 Crescent City Open at New Orleans ( No. 12 ) 1 , work their way up the coast to climax the season with Bobby Jones at his Masters Tournament in Augusta , Ga . Consecutive map numbers follow tour . <P> To be able to join this caravan is the goal of the average U. S. golf professional .

But most of all , the average pro knows that in this troupe the lowliest member may suddenly become the leading man at some performance , may win a few hun-dred dollars and get some press notices which will help him find a better job next year . <P> A larger group than ever started off this year . For fresh in the minds of many was the fabulous feat of Ralph Guldahl , who , debt-laden and jobless , started out on the grapefruit circuit last winter with borrowed clubs and a wheezing jalopy , won $3,500 , went on to win the U. S. Open championship last summer and wound up the year with $8,600 in prize money , a lucrative winter job at the Miami-Biltmore and a potential 1938 income of some $25,000 from endorsing golf equipment , exhibition matches , magazine articles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champion .
