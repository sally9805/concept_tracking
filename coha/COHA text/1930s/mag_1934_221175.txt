In Manhattan , once every week , to a grubby little room on Eighth Avenue went a check from the city relief bureau . The old couple who lived there were always waiting . First thing they did when the check arrived was to buy a bottle of gin . Then they sat on the stairs , guzzled gin , laughed and howled and slapped each other on the back . Last fortnight , after one of their bouts , the tipsy husband tried to light the gas heater . While he fumbled with the matches , gas flooded the room , brought Death to the old couple . <P> Six days their bodies lay unclaimed in the City Morgue before a detective thought to trace the black lace evening gown which he found in the crone 's drawer . Then Broadway knew that " Apple Annie " was dead . Her real name was Helen McCarthy . But for five years , known only as Apple Annie , she stood in a little alley off Times Square , hawked apples &; oranges &; gum . There Sportswriter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them he had an idea . The idea became a story , Apple Annie . The story became a moving picture , Lady For A Day , a film of a bottle-loving harridan who played for 24 hours the part of a Park Avenue dowager ( TIME , Sept. 18 , 1933 ) . Before the cinema opened last autumn , Apple Annie inspired a second idea , this time in the minds of Columbia Pictures ' pressagents . They would make Apple Annie herself a lady for a day . <P> On the stroke of midnight a sleek black limousine rolled up to Annie 's alley . Annie and her apples were whisked across town to the Waldorf-Astoria , escorted to a three-room suite . As a tip the bellboy received an apple . The bed was too soft , the nightgown too silky , the gold &; rose furnishings too frightening to permit sleep . Annie paced the deep plush carpet . Next morning she climbed into bed for breakfast . The pressagents took her to a Fifth Avenue smartshop . Shrewdly she chose two black gowns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After lunch , to her great delight , a police escort cleared the way to City Hall . Bumbling Mayor O'Brien was out . Said Annie : ' I ai n't going to wait . I 'm just as Irish as he is . " She had tea with caviar in a swank restaurant , dined with Showman Samuel L. ( " Roxy ' ' ) Rothafel , saw a preview of Lady For A Day . Taken to a farewell supper , she waltzed , drank , acted as if her Day were to last forever . At midnight Apple Annie vanished from the ball . The pressagents gave her $25 and the clothes she wore , dropped her at her dingy flat . <P> Most of the clothes Annie gave to a friend in distress . A fur scarf she traded for whiskey . In six months , turning 71 , she gave up her apple stand . In eight more she was dead . <P> Last week , with some sentiment and more sense of what makes news , Columbia Pictures gave Apple Annie one more Day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his first dinner coat . In luxury they were buried .
