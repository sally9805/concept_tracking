Resuming his investigation of U. S. railroad finance in Washington last week after an extended holiday adjournment , Montana 's Senator Burton Kendall Wheeler proceeded to another chapter in the popular annals of the late Brothers Van Sweringen ( TIME , Dec. 28 ) . Again the belligerent Senator did little except add spicy paragraphs to a chronicle already well-outlined . The chapter under revision last week concerned a hapless $30,000,000 bond issue put out by the Vans in 1930 with the aid of the best names in Wall Street . <P> Negotiations for this loan started with old Guaranty Co. in the spring of 1929 , the Vans then talking of $60,000,000 . Some of the money was to be used for a Cleveland Rapid Transit promotion , some for the Van Sweringen real estate developments , including suburban Shaker Heights . Guaranty Co. , then headed by Joseph R. Swan , turned down the financing not once but twice . In August 1929 , while he was vacationing in Glacier Park , Banker Swan received a telegram from one of his vice presidents , reporting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. Morgan &; Co . Mr. Stanley had informed the Guaranty that " our friends are sore " - meaning the Vans . <P> Upshot was that negotiations were resumed , the Shaker Heights and traction ideas were dropped and $30,000,000 worth of bonds in Van Sweringen Corp . were sold to the public by a Guaranty Co. syndicate in the ominous spring of 1930 . But the House of Morgan let it be known that it did not even want a " silent interest " in the deal . As it turned out , that was a wise wish indeed . <P> Among other things revealed by Senator Wheeler last week was that the Vans wrote up the company 's real estate holdings $25,500,000 shortly before the bonds were sold , that more than $19,000,000 of the proceeds were used to buy securities from other Van Sweringen companies at prices above the market , that there was some doubt about the possibility of getting the issue qualified under State blue-sky laws . Banker Swan , now a partner in Edward B. Smith &; Co. , sadly shook his head , declaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had in the Van Sweringens . You may say that later on they did things which should not have been done , and we will agree with you . We were mistaken . " <P> Said Senator Vheeler with rare charity : " I do not doubt your good faith , but I do doubt your judgment . " <P> Corporate trustee for the Van Sweringen Corp . issue , in which the public lost $15,000,000 , was Guaranty Trust Co. , the bank , not the security affiliate . It was Senator Wheeler 's contention that the trustee had a moral if not a legal obligation to keep an eye on the Van Sweringens after they got its money . Guaranty Chairman William Chapman Potter , who can swap inquisitorial punches with any Senator , stoutly maintained that he had done his duty . While Mr. Potter was on the stand Senator Wheeler revealed that the banker had sold his personal holdings of Alleghany Corp . stock ( 20,000 shares ) at a smart profit , although the Guaranty Co. considered Alleghany stock fit collateral for a public bond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know where you got your information , but it is right . I am a professional getter-out . " The audience roared .
