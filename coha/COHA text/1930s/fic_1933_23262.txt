UNEASY PAYMENTS A STORY BY GEORGE MILBURN W ALDO LEDBETER , JR . felt the shadow of the reform school hovering over him . All his summer days  --  those bright vacation days he had looked forward to so eagerly back in the sixth grade last winter  --  were clouded with fear . Sometimes he would forget for a few minutes , simply by not trying to forget , but the guilt was always with him to twist him sick and sad again . There was no one to whom he could turn for mercy , least of all his own parents . " Lord God , boy ! that 's a penitentiary offense , " his father cried that terrible noon in May when the deed first came to light . " To think that I 'd raise a son up , and work with him , and try and teach him to do right , and then  --  then to have him sneak off and pull a crooked trick like this . They 'll ship you down to PauIs Valley to the reform school I " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat cold and silent , her lips pressed in a straight line . She had not mentioned his crime , one way or the other , from that moment on . Her silence was even more terrifying than the things his father said , and his father said some awful things . " I 'm not going to whip you this time . I 've tried whipping you , but whipping do n't do any good . This time I 'll just let the law take care of you in its own proper fashion . Don'tcome whining to me when the long arm of the law finally catches up with you . " " Papa , I did n't know it was a penitentiary offense , " Waldo quavered . A moment later he flung himself at his father 's feet , wailing , " Honest , papa , I did n't know it was against the law . " " Ignorance of the law excuses nobody . And do n't try to fib out of it now . If you did n't know you was doing wrong , how come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked me , like any honest boy would , I might of bought you a bicycle . But , no ! you had to sneak off like a thief in the night without saying a word to anyone . Well , I wash my hands of you . The judge can ship you off to reform school for all I care . I 'm through trying to do anything with you . Absolutely through ! " All this had been said back in May , the day after the bicycle came . It had been repeated many times since . But in May there had been a glimmer of hope . Waldo had supposed then that if he could only avoid the Sheriff through the summer he could pull himself out of danger before September . Now , summer was gone and there was nothing but blank despair . Every ominous prediction his father had made was rapidly coming true . Sometimes he would wake up in the morning feeling free , and he would whisper to himself that the whole thing was nothing but a bad dream . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to the reform school . Now that it was morning again he could laugh and forget that nightmare . But as soon as he was fully awake dread settled on him again , and he knew that it was not a dream . It was real . Another day of cringing fear had begun . Dreaming could be used to make unreal things real , but it would not work the other way . Dreaming , in fact , had led Waldo into forgery and using the mails to defraud . He would have explained that to his father if his father had been an ordinary man instead of R. W. E. Ledbetter , editor of the Weekly Democrat . He could have explained enough , at least , to prove that he was not a real crook . He might deserve a whipping , but not the reform school . How , though. , could a man who wrote what the whole town read be expected to waste time on nonsense ? " Waldo remembered clearly how it started . It had started as a made-up game . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to beat and there was no way to lose and it had to be played in secret . He played it first with his geography , looking at the animal maps . Little pictures of animals native to each continent were scattered over the maps . He would hurry home from school every afternoon and go into his bedroom and thumb-Iatch the door . Then he would lie prone on the matting-covered floor , his elbows propped on his open geography . He would continue the long lists in a special pencil tablet : AUSTRALIA 4 kangaroos 2 duckbills 6 dingos . . Africa was more exciting : AFRICA 24 lions 6 giraffes 120 elephants ( African ) 100 zebras 4 gnus 4 rhinoceroses 4 gorillas 100 monkeys 2 hippopotamuses Here was the part , though , that Waldo did n't know how he could explain to his father . Here was the crazy part . While he was making those lists he was R. W. Emerson Ledbetter , the millionaire circus owner . Ledbetter 's six-ring circus and wild-animal menagerie , the greatest show in the world , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canvas from the jungles of seven continents . Even Ringling Brothers had only one hippopotamus . Ledbetter 's Circus had two hippopotamuses . The lists on pencil tablet paper were the animals in Ledbetter 's Circus . Making those lists was not merely as much fun as owning a circus . Those lists were Ledbetter 's Circus . Waldo knew that he would have to tell his father about the circus before he could so much as explain about the steamship booklets . His father had never fully understood about the steamship booklets . The steamship incident had given his father the fixed idea that Waldo was a liar with criminal tendencies . His circus lists were almost complete when travel advertisements suddenly interested Waldo . " Send for free illustrated travel brochure ! " Waldo cleaned out the medicine chest , washed up a bunch of old prescription bottles , scalded them bright , and sold them to Danziger 's Pharmacy for a dime . He found three empty tow sacks out in the barn and sold them at Gresham 's Grist Mill for fifteen cents . He wrote on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send me your free illustrated literature , as I am interested in making a trip around the world . Yours truly , R. WALDO E. LEDBETTER , JR . He addressed the cards to all the steamship and railroad companies he could find advertised . Later his father said that what Waldo wrote on those postal cards was a bare-faced lie . That proved that his father did not understand . Waldo did not even attempt to explain that when he was writing those cards he was R. Waldo E. Ledbetter , Jr. , the famous millionaire globe-trotter . The steamship companies did not question it . Large brown envelopes , fat and heavy with free illustrated literature , began coming in . Usually Waldo would be right there at the post office waiting , but his father happened to get two or three envelopes full of steamship booklets from the post office . He did n't scold Waldo at the time . He seemed approving . He thumbed through some of the pamphlets , looking at the pictures , and he passed the free illustrated literature on to his anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many were beautiful booklets , sumptuously printed on heavy slick paper , run through and tied with flossy cords that held on the embossed cardboard covers , all with pictures of foreign lands more exciting than any in the geography . Waldo spent hours over the steamship booklets , planning a world tour . A day or two before a big envelope came in there would be a personal letter to Waldo from the general passenger agent , saying that the free illustrated literature he had requested was being forwarded under separate cover . The general passenger agent always wrote as courteously as if Waldo really were a millionaire globe-trotter . The letter would say also that Waldo 's request was being referred to the company 's district representative . Such letters made Waldo feel important , but they made him feel a little uneasy , too . As soon as he read them he would tear them up and toss them into a post office wastepaper barrel . He was having too much fun with scenes of faroff lands to bother with letters . One noon his father sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a man came in at the Democrat office this morning to see you . Said he had come all the way from Kansas City to see you about a steamship ticket around the world , for that trip you 're going to take . " Waldo felt sick . He did n't know whether to believe it . His father seemed in good humor . His father and mother both laughed and teased him that day . They took it as a great joke at first . " Well , son , when do you expect to start around the world ? " That was before the steamship company men began arriving thick and fast . There seemed to be an impression among them that R. Waldo E. Ledbetter , Jr . was a farmer who had struck oil . Scarcely a day passed for a week without a stranger getting off the train and inquiring for Mr. Ledbetter . Even after they could see it was a hopeless quest , they would hang around the Democrat office , trying out their sales talks on Waldo 's father . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train , and Thursday was the day the Democrat went to press . That day Waldo 's father came home and unhooked the razor strap . " I 'm going to break you of this lying , " he said grimly after he had led Waldo out back of the house . People living over in the next block heard the heavy thwacks punctuating Waldo 's squalls . That whipping should have warned Waldo in time to abandon his mail-order catalogues . He realized that later . But it was not until he was about to go to reform school that he saw clearly the circus lists , the steamship booklets , the catalogues as links in his crime . He kept the Sears Roebuck catalogue and the Montgomery Ward catalogue in a big pasteboard box in his room under his bed . Everything that was valuable to him was in that box : his stamp collection , his steamship booklets , his marbles , his pencil tablets full of lists , and his mail-order catalogues . He made believe that the pasteboard box was an iron-bound chest . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe as if it were locked in an iron-bound chest . It had never occurred to Waldo that anyone else could lift the lid . One afternoon early in November he was stretched out on the floor with his mail-order catalogues . He had been so eager to get back to them after school he had forgotten to thumb-latch his door . He was , at that moment , Rafe Ledbetter , the North Woods trapper , fitting out an expedition . He was jotting down a list of supplies : I Cantleek canvas canoe I pneumatic mattress I waterproof wall tent 1 lamb 's wool sleeping bag 2 ponchos 1 46-pc. aluminum camp set 1 pr moccasin hoots 1 Winchester .32 repeating rifle He heard his father 's step on the front porch . A moment later the door to his room opened and his father looked in . Waldo quickly flipped the catalogue shut and covered his list with one arm . His father stood over him , asking , " What 're you doing , always laying around after school with your nose stuck in some catalogue ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just playing . " " That 's no way to play . Why do n't you get out in the open air and play like other boys do ? Or else get out and do a little work around the yard . You 'll never earn a nickel with your nose stuck in some old mail-order catalogue all the time . " Waldo wondered how long his father was going to keep on standing there , talking . What did he want to earn a nickel for ? What was a nickel , when you could be a millionaire and could have anything you wanted simply by putting it on a list ? His father talked on . " If you do n't cut out this crazy fool business of laying around on your stomach all the time with your face in those old catalogues , I 'm going to do something about it . You see if I do n't ! A person would think you had softening of the brain . I 've got a notion to take those catalogues out in the alley and set fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgrace to have them in the house anyway . " His father did n't understand about the catalogues . His father never would know how much fun a person can have with mail-order catalogues , making believe he is a rancher fitting himself out with everything from branding irons to angora chaps ; or a farmer equipping a model farm ; or simply a father ordering toys for his son . The toy list was the most fun of all . " You 'll never make a nickel . You wo n't be able to lay around on your stomach like that all your life . You 're going to have to get out and hustle for yourself one of these days . There 'll come a day when you 'll be wanting a crust of bread for your stomach , and you wo n't find it in any mail-order catalogue neither . " Waldo studied the red and green straws running through the tan matting weave . His father finally turned and walked out . Waldo began to see what his father meant though . If he ever expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe he had them , he must make money to buy them . But it still seemed better to imagine one had a million dollars and everything that could be found in the big catalogues than it was to have a few real dollars and nothing more than those few dollars would buy . Tom Draper , next door , had a bicycle . He was stingy with it , but sometimes in a trade he would let Waldo ride it . It was n't much of a bicycle compared with the bicycles in the catalogues . Waldo had never had as much fun riding Tom 's bike as he had had in making believe that he owned the best bicycle in the catalogue . He opened the catalogues again now that he was alone . Each thick book fell open easily at the slick paper section of bicycle pictures in colors . There in Sears ' catalogue , large and bright , were the Cardinal and the Bluebird and the expensive Silver Eagle . And in Ward 's , the Super Flyer , black and ivory enameled and chromium plated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue ; and the lower-priced Speed Model . Waldo read the descriptions over slowly , relishing them for the hundredth time . But now , for the first time , he pondered whether it was better to buy one bicycle and have it to ride than it was to have any bicycle in the catalogue , even to the Road King bike motor that makes a motorcycle out of an ordinary bicycle , his when he put it on his list . Suddenly the prices in the catalogues seemed very large . There was the Silver Eagle , completely equippedwith electric horn and headlight , $32.90 cash , even more on easy payments . That would be 329 dimes . Could he hope ever to have that much money ? It made a difference , looking at a catalogue with prudent thoughts of buying . It gave him a sad , lost feeling to know that he was small and penniless after so much had been his . Never after that was he able to recapture the old pleasure he had taken in the catalogue game . Once Waldo got started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever had been . The next day , a Saturday , he went out to the barn to see how many empty gunny sacks had accumulated since the last time he had needed postage money . He searched through the heap of dusty jute sacks and found two that had no holes . The rats had got to some , and the grist mill would n't buy torn sacks . Then he found the gunny sack that would make three others . It was the biggest tow sack Waldo had ever seen . He remembered the night his father had carried home groceries in it from Whipple 's store . It was lined with fiber paper and a faint aroma came from it as he held it up to read , printed in large red letters across its coarse brown weave : " 100 lbs . Fancy Roasted Rio Coffee . " Waldo calculated happily : if an ordinary cornchops sack would bring a nickel , this sack should be worth at least fifteen cents . " Gosh , no , son , " Mr. Gresham said at the mill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't buy that there coffee sack , I 'll pay you a nickel apiece for them other two , but I ai n't got no use for a coffee sack . You take roasted coffee beans , they weigh light . Why that there coffee sack would hold three-four hunnerd pounds of cornchops , You can leave it here if you want to , son , but I cai n't UNEASY pay you nothing for it . It ai n't no use to me . " Waldo brought the coffee sack home and tossed it back into the crib . He had a dime , anyway . A dime was all he needed to write and get himself appointed subscription agent for all the popular magazines . There was established competition in town , to be sure . The Widow Holcomb , for one , was an energetic subscription taker . And there were always those strangers who were working their way through college . But Waldo had his own system . He did not waste time going from door-to-door as the others did . Every day he would poke through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which he got names and expiration dates . Thursday mornings he would stand in the post office lobby until almost school time , watching to see who took the Saturday Evening Post . The end of the year was approaching and many subscriptions were expiring . Usually he had only to follow up label clues to get renewal subscriptions . Two or three times a week he would pass between the polished granite pillars on the corner opposite the court house and enter a shadowy , mysterious place filled with the smell of furniture polish and a murmuring quiet apt to be broken briefly by the startling clatter of an adding machine . His metal heel taps clicked on the tile floor . Resisting an impulse to skate , he would march solemnly up and push under the cashier 's wicker his subscription money and his small brown leather book inscribed : " Conchartee National Bank in account with R. Waldo E. Ledbetter , jr . " He would glimpse W. S. Winston back in the president 's enclosure , sitting as close to his desk as his belly would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off into space while an anxious cotton farmer sat talking . Mr. Lennox , the cashier , a mild , bald little man with rimless eyeglasses , would count the deposit , make a debt entry in the bank book , and pass it back to Waldo . " You 're coming right along , Waldo . How 's business ? " " Pretty good , Mr. Lennox . I took six subscriptions to the Post and four to the Ladies Home Journal yesterday afternoon . " " Well , that 's fine . You stay right in there and pitch ! " His bank balance , two weeks before Christmas , was $17.65 . He had more than half enough to pay cash for the Silver Eagle . One night after supper he went in to study the catalogue bicycle pages again . He had about decided on a lower-priced wheel . When he took the Iid off his pasteboard box the catalogues were not there . He searched the room . Then he hurried out to ask his mother if she had seen anything of them . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . His father was sitting in the front room reading the Tulsa Tribune . Waldo went in and asked , " Papa , did you see anything of my catalogues ? " His father mumbled without lowering the newspaper , " You do n't expect me to try to keep track of your junk , do you ? " Waldo went on searching through the house until his father slammed down the paper , shouting , " Young man , you come in here and get settled down to your home work , or I 'm going to give you a dressing down you wo n't forget soon . Quit tearing up the house looking for some old catalogues that do n't amount to the flip of a pin anyhow . " The next morning at breakfast his father said , " Waldo , it 's getting cold weather now , and you 're needing winter clothes . You 're a big half-grown boy now , and I 'm going to let you buy your own clothes this winter . You 've been doing mighty fine here lately . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own clothes , just as if he were a man . He and his father went into the Whipple Mercantile Company , and his father picked out a boy 's overcoat , $7.50 , and a pair of laced boots , $3.50 , and a heavy sweater , $3.00 . Waldo , feeling his importance , said , " Gee whiz , papa , we could buy these things from Montgomery Ward or Sears Roebuck a lot cheaper than this . " Mr. Whipple , who was waiting on them , laughed and said , " Is that where you been doing all your trading , Waldo ? " His father acted sore . As soon as Waldo had written Mr. Whipple a check for $14 and they had started home with the bundles , his father grabbed him by the arm and said , " Do n't ever let me hear you say anything about buying from a mail-order company again , young man . " " Why , papa ? " " Because I say so , that 's why . You understand ? " After that Waldo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even have enough to make a down payment on one , anyway . He did n't care much . He was having a good time , bragging to other boys about his father 's letting him buy his own clothes . But sometimes he was sorry that he did n't have the catalogues to play with any more . He had sent off for new catalogues . He watched the post office for weeks , waiting for the catalogues to come . If they ever came , he did not see them . One day in April Mr. Lennox , the bank cashier , stopped to talk with Waldo on the street . He said , " What 's the matter , Waldo , I never do see you in the bank any more ? You was making money hand-over-fist there awhile before Christmas . Used to be in ever ' day or so . " Waldo said , " Yes , sir , but that was when I was taking magazine subscriptions . That played out after Christmas . That business is n't so good except in November and December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's not much in it for a person now . " " Well , Waldo , you 're a pretty bright boy , and I 'm going to put you onto a way you can pick up a nice little piece of money . I 'm looking for a good reliable boy to drive my cow out to pasture every morning and bring her in every night before milking time . It 's Slover 's pasture nut here a mileand-a-half north of town . " " When would you want me to start , Mr. Lennox ? I have to keep on going to school until the sixteenth of May . " " Oh , this wo n't interfere with your school , Waldo . You can drive her out about seven am. every morning and be back in plenty of time for school . Then you can go get her an hour or so after school 's out . I 'll pay you a dollar a month , and if you 'll get round and see a few others who pasture their cows , you could get a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money this summer . But April is half gone , and of course I ca n't pay you but fifty cents for April . " Waldo inquired through the neighborhood and found four other cows to drive . He went into the Conchartee National Bank on the first of May to collect from Mr. Lennox and to deposit $2.50 , his April earnings . Mr. Lennox handed him a statement of his account , and Waldo saw that he still had $3.65 in the bank that he had almost forgotten . He hurried home that day and went over next door and borrowed Mrs. Draper 's new Montgomery Ward catalogue . At first he thought he would only look to see whether the bicycles were still there . The bicycles were still there , all right , and so was the offer : " Easy Payments , Only $5 Down , $5 a Month . " Waldo began filling out an easy payment order blank , just for fun : 160K3030 1 Hawthorne Speed Model Cherry Red $24.15 . The lower half of the blank , a contract and credit form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have order signed by parent or guardian . " Waldo skipped that , making believe that he was a father ordering the bicycle for his little boy . But his $5 down was real . The following week he spent most of his time before and after school over at the M. K. &; T. depot . He had almost given up hope when one afternoon the 4:30 local came in , and the first crate thrown out of the box car held a shining red bicycle . As soon as the freight train had pulled out , Harry Conklin , the station agent , helped Waldo knock off the crate and assemble the bicycle . It had $1.13 freight charges on it , and Waldo gave Mr. Conklin a check . " This sure is a fine wheel , Waldo , " Harry Conklin said . " Did your papa order this wheel for you ? " " Sure he did , " Waldo said . " My papa orders me anything I want . " Then Harry Conklin said , " Well , what does the old hypocrite mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , telling other people not to buy from them , and then he goes and buys you a bicycle from Ward 's . Why do n't he practice what he preaches ? " Waldo , getting set to ride away , said haughtily , " You 're full of prunes , Old Man Conklin . My father is not a hypocrite . My father wanted to buy me the best bike going , and Montgomery Ward happened to have the best bike going , so he ordered it from there . That 's all . " When he came riding up into the front yard on his new bicycle , his mother said , " Gracious sakes , child , where 'd you get that wheel ? " " I ordered it from Montgomery Ward 's , mamma . I paid five dollars down , and I 'm going to pay it out with what I make driving cows every month . I 've only got $19.40 left to pay . Is n't it swell , mamma ? " " Waldo , your father is going to have a duck fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out to the barn and hide it until I can have a talk with him and sort of get him talked into the idea . " The first thing his father said the next day at noon was , " Young man , what 's this I hear about you getting a bicycle on the 4:30 freight yesterday ? Where 'd you get the money to buy a bicycle ? " Waldo felt the bottom dropping out of everything , but he said bravely , " Why , I 'm making the money driving cows this summer , papa . So I thought I 'd buy me a bicycle on the easy payment plan . " " The easy payment plan ? How 'd you get credit for any easy payment plan ? You 're just a minor . You could n't buy that way without you had a grown-up sign your order . Who signed your order for you ? " " I do n't guess they knew I was a minor , papa . I gave Winston 's bank for a reference , and I just left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who signed your order for you , young man ? Your mother ? " " No , sir . 1 signed it myself , only the place where you sign is so skimpy , and my name is so long , I did n't have room to write my full name . So I had to leave off the ' Junior . ' " " What ! You mean you signed my name ? Lord God , boy , that 's forgery ! That 's a penitentiary offense ! " " Papa , I 'll send the old bicycle back . I did n't actually want it anyway . I 'll crate it up and send it tight back ! " " No you wo n't either ! You 're not going to wiggle out of it that easy . You forged my name to get that bicycle , now you can keep it and take the consequences . They 'll send you to the reform school for this little trick , young man . Oh , to think that I 'd raise a son up and work with him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then .. . " Frightened though he was , Waldo still had hope at first . He mailed on June the first the five dollars he earned in May , and another five dollars on July the first . He was beginning to see his way through to freedom when the drouth sealed his doom . No rain had fallen since the tenth of June . By the latter part of the month his patrons had begun saying that there was no use in sending a cow to pasture . Every blade of grass was burned crisp . Slover 's cattle tanks were broad gray basins of cracked mud dotted with yellow-grained crawfish mounds . After the first of July people kept their cows in town , where at least there was water . When the fateful dry spell closed in on him Waldo knew that he could not meet the August payment on his bicycle . He worked every day at his father 's printing shop , sweeping the floor , distributing type , feeding and cleaning the job press , running errands . His father gave not the slightest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ward started dunning him about the middle of August . He still owed a balance of $9.40 . He dared not send any word of explanation for fear some slip might reveal his forgery . The collection letters grew less polite , more urgent , and finally one came saying that , unless his unpaid balance of $9.40 was sent immediately , recourse to law would be taken to collect it . The day that letter came Sheriff Ferguson caught Waldo . Waldo had succeeded in avoiding the Sheriff for almost four months , ducking round a corner every time he caught sight of Sheriff Ferguson 's portly form striding down the street from the courthouse . But that day the Sheriff stepped out of Danziger 's Pharmacy at the moment Waldo started in . Some loafers were sitting on the curb watching the dust clouds roll down Broadway . They were talking about the long dry spell . " Well , Waldo , " Sheriff Ferguson said jovially , " you about ready to start to reform school with me this fall ? " Waldo stood there stark with fright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waldo 's hair and walked on . Waldo did n't know whether to run or stand still . His chin began snubbing . Herman Gutterman , the booze-ruddy old whiskey-maker , came over to him . " Do n't you never Iet ' em guy you , Waldo . Your pappy ribbed the Sheriff up to say that . I heerd him when he done it . You 're all right , son . They ai n't going to send you to no reform school . That 's just their idea of a joke . " He winked a bleary blue eye at Waldo . Waldo gave the old moonshiner a suspicious look and walked away . You could n't believe a word a bootlegger said . There was a good time coming for all the other boys in town . As for Waldo , he did not expect ever to have a good time again . September had come , another month added to his default . It was only a matter of days now until he must pay the penalty for his crime . One Saturday morning he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up against the hack of the building and went into the shop . He picked up the broom and got a scoopful of red floorsweep , preparing to sweep out , to start the morning routine . His father called : You do n't need to sweep out to-day , son . Just let the sweeping go . Go on and have a good time . Go join the celebration . " " What celebration ? " Waldo asked dully . " What celebration ! You 're working here at the Democrat and you ask me what celebration ? Here , did n't you never read this ? " Waldo took the big pink handbill . He had seen it two weeks ago , the day it was printed . He glanced at the large type again .

He walked disconsolately through the crowd that had already begun to gather round the courthouse square . There was nothing for him ? to celebrate . The DeMoTay Band was tuning up in the bandstand over on the southwest corner of the square . A thin squeal from a clarinet followed by an um-pah from the bass horn made the crowd laugh . Waldo walked along under the heat-wilted trees , kicking at dried catalpa beans . He saw grizzled old Herman Gutterman kicking up his heels , already hilarious on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the White Front Grocery .

Two or three enterprising small boys with their tubs set on the sidewalk had started shrilling , Ice cold sody pop ! Freeze yer teeth , And curl yer hair , And make you walk Like a millionaire . When noon came Waldo , still skeptical about Pollack Brothers throwing away money , stood with the crowd that had gathered in the street out in front of the store . Sure enough , the Pollack brothers ' two swart faces appeared above the brick false storey . They set a canvas money bag up on the brick cornice for all to see and plunged their hands in . Two handfuls of copper and nickel coins glinted in the blinding sunlight . There was a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dime fall and he went sprawling after it . A big farmer stepped on his fingers , barking them until they bled , but Waldo felt no pain . It was over all too quickly . The Pollack brothers shook out the coin bag to show that all the money had been scattered . They disappeared down the roof . The crowd milled about , laughing and comparing catches . Waldo saw some boys he knew . " I got eighteen cents , " he said proudly . " What did you guys get ? " " Aw , you did n't get that much . Nobody got that much without it was that guy that caught the $20 gold piece in the air . " " Let 's see it , Waldo , " Bill Slover , a lumpish farm boy , said . Waldo held out his open palm , showing a grimy dime and a nickel and three cents . Bill Slover slapped the coins out of his hand . The boys all scrambled for the money .

" I 'll get even with your ' Up the street the potato race had started . Waldo stood on the sidelines musing , trying to think of a way to win without having to make all those trips . He noticed that several of the farmers looking on carried tow sacks tucked under their arms . Back of the crowded sidelines he saw Bill Slover walking in a bran sack , holding the top of it clutched at his waist . He was mincing along cautiously , trying to keep from stumbling . Bill looked odd with his beefy bottom stuffed tightly in a gunny sack . " What 're you doing in that tow sack , Bill ? " Waldo asked . " Practicing up for the sack race , what 'd you think ? I 'm going to win me that five-dollar gold piece prize . You watch me . " " Could I get in the sack race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They ai n't nobody holdin ' you , are they ? You cai n't run in a sack race without no sack though . " Waldo ran as fast as he could to the printing office . He got his bicycle and pedalled hard for home . When he got back to Broadway , panting and out of breath , they were already lined up for the sack race . Men and boys hobbled with gunny sacks stood in a line that reached from one side of Broadway to the other . Down at the crossing , half-a-block away , a crowd had gathered at the finish line . Waldo stepped quickly into line , pulled his gunny sack up over his legs and clutched it at his waist . Everyone was looking toward Al Kimball , who stood ready to fire the starting pistol . The pistol cracked , and the long , brown-hobbled line wavered and surged forward . One after another , racers who tried to step out too quickly , stumbled and went thudding down . Waldo could not see anything but the press of faces at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burly farmers striking the ground heavily , cursing and grunting . He did not look back . He took long steps , and every time he was about to stumble he would let out the big coffee sack a little more . His feet moved freely in its ample folds . A great shout of laughter went up from the crowd when they saw Waldo , up to his armpits in the huge gunny sack , striding out ahead . The only face Waldo could recognize in the white blur at the goal was Herman Gutterman 's grizzled , red-nosed mug . Herman was cheering him . " Whoopee ! Come on thar , you Waldo ! " Herman kept shouting . All along the course the racers who had fallen were getting to their feet again . Waldo took a backward glimpse and saw that Bill Slover was the only one close to him . Bill was coming on with a rapid twisting mo-Lion he had practiced . They were within a few feet of the finish when Bill reached out and clutched at Waldo . Bill lost his balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the tape and into the arms of Herman Gutterman , who let out another " Whuppy " that was a blast of whiskey breath in Waldo 's face . He struggled free , and the throng surged round him , laughing and shouting . Mr. Lennox , the sack-race judge , smiling his strained smile , held up the five-dollar gold piece to present to the winner . Just as Waldo reached up to take it , Bill Slover came hopping across the line , bawling angrily , " Hold on a minute there ! He cheated ! He had a great big sack whur the rest of us just had ordinary gunny sacks . " There was a murmur through the crowd . Opinion was divided . Some of the spectators were saying that when you came right down to it , using a big sack Iike that was n't fair . A body could take full-Iength steps in a big sack . The whole idea of a sack race was to have the runners hobbled . That Ledbetter boy was a town boy too . Mr. Lennox hesitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came rolling out over the heads of the people . " Just a minute , Lennox ! " Banker Winston , the richest man in town , spoke , and the press gave way before his great paunch . " There ought not be any difficulty in making a decision here , " W. S. Winston bumbled , taking the gold piece from Mr. Lennox . " This lad here ( putting his hand on Waldo 's head ) crossed the finish line first . Nothing was ever specified about the size of the gunny sacks to be used in this sack race . All the more praise to this lad for being slick enough to go get him anextra large sack . Any lad quick-witted , enough to outsmart his competitors in the way this lad has done deserves two prizes . Here , my boy , " W. S. Winston said , handing Waldo the five-dollar gold piece . " Amen , Double Sl You shore spoke a mouthful , " Herman Gutter-man yelled , slamming his old black Stetson on the ground and stamping on it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm a-goin ' to reward the other'n to him right now . " Herman pulled a thin roll of currency out of his pocket , snapped off the rubber band , and handed Waldo a five-dollar bill . The throng laughed loud approbation . It was wonderful . It was a little too wonderful . Waldo did not linger . He squirmed through the thick stockade of legs and reached the sidewalk . He raced round the corner , down the quiet side-street toward the post office . Postmaster Shannon was standing at the money-order window . Waldo pushed the gold piece and the five-dollar bill under the wicket . " Mr. Shannon , would you took and see if this is real money ? " Sounds from the hog-calling contest came drifting into the quiet post office , " Sook-sook-sook , sooey , soo-oo-eyl " " Why , yes , it looks like real money to me , Waldo . What 's the matter ? Did something make you think it was counterfeit ? " " No , sir I thought it was real money . Then will you write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company ? " " Money-order application blanks are right over there on the lobby desk , Waldo . You 're a big enough boy now to be filling out your own blanks , " Postmaster Shannon said .
