A onetime Rhodes scholar whose first big job was assistant to famed Criminal Lawyer Clarence Darrow in 1910 , Charles D. Mahaffie was appointed to the Interstate Commerce Commission eight years ago . Since then he has been ICC 's chief dissenter - notably on railroad reorganizations which , he said in 1936 , " have not been sufficiently drastic . " Last week , with Commissioner Mahaffie alone dissenting , ICC approved a reorganization plan as drastic as any ever devised for a major U.S. railroad . Under this plan , portentous for an industry snowed under by its bonded debt , Chicago Great Western Railroad 's capitalization will be cut from $139,247,313 to $62 , 291 , 827 , its annual fixed interest charges from $1,705,532 to $767,071 . Common stockholders will not get a cent ; preferred stockholders will swap their shares ( par value : $46,073,500 ) for new common stock ( par value : $11,518,375 ) ; first-mortgage bondholders will get new stocks and bonds and 67.92% of the voting power . <P> First reorganization of a major Class I carrier approved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of those adopted before 1933 's amendments to the Federal Bankruptcy Act . Formerly , the practice was for underwriters to get a friendly creditor to bring suit in a friendly court , thus in effect pick their own receiver-who generally favored stockholders over bondholders ; often railroads were in as bad shape after reorganization as before . Under Section 77 , ICC can insist on its own reorganization terms or rewrite plans originally submitted . ICC accepted almost wholly the trustee 's draft of the Great Western plan , which will take effect Jan. 1 , 1939 if approved by the Federal Court in Chicago . <P> Organized in 1892 . Great Western was sold under foreclosure in 1909. asked for reorganization under the Federal Bankruptcy Act in February 1935 . It has never paid a common stock dividend , has never paid its $4 preferred in full . Last year the road piled up a $902,363 deficit . Had it been operating under the ICC-approved reorganization , it would have earned only 1.4% on its capitalization . This fact presumably prompted Commissioner Mahaffie to dissent again , ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The majority approve a plan that cuts obligatory interest severely and to a basis that in the past would . . . have been adequately covered . But the plan now approved is for the future . ... A new structure should protect creditor claims to earnings as far as is practicable . ... It should be calculated also to prevent the necessity of future reorganization. "
