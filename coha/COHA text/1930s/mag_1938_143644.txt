Battle of the Nations <P> In bitter cold and driving snow , into its 17th day last week moved the greatest battle Spain 's war has yet produced . <P> On any war map Teruel is the nail on a narrow finger of Rightist territory pointed at Leftist Valencia and only 75 miles from the Mediterranean , though those 75 miles include territory as difficult as any that a modern army could be asked to cross . Leftist General Rojo 's capture of all but a few buildings in the centre of Teruel ( TIME , Jan. 3 et ante ) , and the driving of his lines some six miles beyond the city , meant no more than the nipping of that fingernail . In another sense , it was a major victory of the war , for it took the initiative away from General Franco just as he was about to launch his long-planned drive and induced him to pour his reserves of men and munitions into the battlefront chosen by his opponents . Apparently it ended the danger of a surprise Rightist offensive at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as important to Leftist morale . By a swift , well-executed triple-column movement Leftist arms had captured the strongest point yet in the Rightist line , a town elaborately fortified by its garrison for over a year . <P> If the object of the drive on Teruel was to pull down the full force of Franco 's armies on Leftist heads , it succeeded last week beyond measure . With his toughest general , Miguel ( siege of Oviedo ) Aranda , and his ablest General , Jose Fidel ( capture of Bilbao ) Davila , leading the counterattack , El Caudillo himself reportedly took charge of the campaign from field headquarters 75 miles northwest at Calatayud . <P> To retake one small town* he massed 500 field guns on a 25-mile front , sent some 200 planes into the grey and icy sky and poured Spaniards , Moors , Foreign Legionnaires , Italian Blackshirts into the lines . <P> The Leftist high command did not hold back either . Playing the psychological angle for all it was worth in the early days of the battle , Barcelona boasted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cathedral would be given every opportunity to surrender with honor in contrast to General Franco 's notorious mass executions in territory he has conquered . <P> All this was forgotten as the full force of El Caudillo 's war machine rolled closer . To make as short work as possible of the Rightist defense within the city , miners blew the remains of the Bank of Spain branch sky high , burying an unknown number of men , women and children in the debris . Soon the Battle of Teruel became a battle of all nations as the U. S. Abraham Lincoln Battalion and other foreign battalions moved into the Leftist lines . New Year 's Eve saw Spaniards , Italians , U. S. citizens , Moors , Germans , Czechs and Frenchmen all fighting for a town on a river bank about the size of Emporia , Kans . <P> Four important highways join at Teruel ( see map ) . Down the one from Sagunto and Valencia through Puebla de Valverde the Leftist offensive drove to capture Mansueto Hill , most important height above the city . Upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one wing sweeping round Villastar and Campillo to half way between Concud and Caudete , another wing reaching Sierra Palomera at the height of its drive , off TIME 'S map and 18 miles away .
