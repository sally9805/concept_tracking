The House was dog-tired at the end of the hardest week of the session . It was ready for adjournment at midafternoon , and voted it . But over at the other end of the Capitol , West Virginia 's stripling Senator Rush Dew Holt had led-strangely enough , since it was the United Mine Workers who had helped elect him and John L. Lewis was frowning down from the gallery and cursing him for a traitor- a filibuster against the substitute Guffey Coal Control Bill . Spelled by colleagues eager to speak their pieces in the nation 's ear for the last time this year , Senator Holt kept the filibuster going through the afternoon and evening , at one time piping passages from Aesop 's Fables in his youthful tenor . It was 11:55 Prn. when the Senate finally gave in . But the House , though too tired for adjournment horseplay , could not stop talking . Not until 12:39 a. m. did Speaker Bankhead 's gavel ring to a halt the listless end of the 74th Congress ' listless second &; last session . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the term " deliberative assembly " in its last week , jam through more bills than it has passed in any previous week . But in the political year 1936 the 74th Congress , tardy because of its recess for the Republican convention and straining to be through in time for the Democratic convention , outdid most of its predecessors . Important bills enacted last week : <P> Tax <P> First Deficiency , providing $1,425,000,000 for President Roosevelt to spend on Relief in almost any way he pleases except to continue the Florida Ship Canal . <P> Anti-Chain Store , to protect independent merchants by forbidding fake discounts and rebates to chain purchasers , empowering the Federal Trade Commission to fix maximum discounts on quantity purchases ( TIME , March 16 ) . <P> Government Contracts , establishing an NRA-like code of wages and working conditions ( 8-hour day , 40-hour week , prevailing wages ) for manufacturers and distributors who sell the Government at least $10,000 worth of goods per year . Expected to affect 75% of the nation 's industry , it brought a prompt protest from steelmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their business . <P> Ship Subsidy , substituting a forthright system of direct subsidies to shippers for the current indirect and unsavory system of padded ocean-mail contracts . To expand the U. S. merchant marine , the Government will pay up to half the cost of building a ship , lend the operator half of the remainder , pay him an operating subsidy based on the difference between U. S. and foreign costs . <P> Treasury-Post Office Supply : $992,524,892 . <P> Major measures passed by one house and killed by the other last week : Coal Control , Housing , Pure Food &; Drugs . Rejected by the House , the Black Lobby Registration bill was not brought to a Senate vote . <P> The second session of the 74th Congress will be remembered chiefly because it passed the $1,936,213,950 Bonus and appropriated $7,240,216,913 besides AAA , topping the $9,579,756,510 it voted in its first session .
