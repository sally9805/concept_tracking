An old gentleman with a long white beard and brown dressing gown , dropping a festoon of red paper on a plaster foot and a jumble of wire , was stopping the sidewalk traffic on Philadelphia 's busy Chestnut Street last week . He was in a window of Blum 's department store , and across the street in Wanamaker 's windows were some equally strange displays . Philadelphia 's radio station KYW broadcast two haywire programs called " Love on Wheels " and " Love is a Dream , " and Philadelphia 's newspapers were filled with angry letters-to-the-editor . The answer was that Surrealism had come to Philadelphia . At the Pennsylvania Museum of Art was the most newsworthy exhibition it has ever had , the traveling show of Surrealist Art organized by New York 's Museum of Modern Art ( TIME , Dec. 14 ) . <P> The Museum 's president , canny John Stogdell ( " Stog " ) Stokes , had staged his act with great skill . With thousands of Philadelphians who had never been near his imposing yellow limestone building sweeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drive he had long been planning : a campaign to raise $15,500,000 for his institution in the next ten years . <P> President Stokes is not only one of the most important but one of the shrewdest museum presidents in the U. S. An oldline Quaker , independently wealthy , his personal hobby is collecting Pennsylvania Dutch furniture and anecdotes . Friends say that for years he has carried on a private war with an old lady in Kansas who owns and refuses to sell a rare Windsor chair that matches one in his home . His favorite story is of a rival collector who bargained skillfully with a farmer for a fine bedstead , lost it when the farmer 's wife said : " We have n't made any sauerkraut this year , just five barrels in case of sickness . " The collector laughed so uproariously the farmer refused to sell . <P> Under the presidency of " Stog " Stokes , the Pennsylvania Museum has equired a $20,000,000 building , topped with a huge pink terra cotta Zeus , and collections with an estimated value of between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Masters , it includes New York 's beloved Madison Square Diana , and the finest collection of the works of Thomas Eakins in the U. S. But less than 20% of the interior of the tremendous <P> building is finished and available for exhibition space . Five-sixths of the museum 's treasures are in its cellars , with no space to show them . Of his $15,500,000 fund , President Stokes intends to set aside two-thirds to finish the building , complete and endow its collections . The balance will endow the Museum 's schools .
