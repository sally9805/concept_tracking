In 1929 , with a billion barrels of oil being produced in the U. S. , the price was $1.27 a barrel , high enough to give a company like Gulf Oil $44,000,000 in profits . Then a wildcatter named Dad Joiner brought in a well in East Texas and . within a year crude was selling for 10 . <P> It took martial law in two States and the best efforts of Secretary Ickes and the NRA to get the price up again . When NRA went out , oilmen relied on proration : no well in the East Texas field was allowed to run off more than a fixed amount ( now an average of 20 barrels a day ) , and an Interstate Oil Compact , promoted by Oklahoma 's Governor Ernest Marland , spread production control to six States-Texas , Oklahoma , Kansas , New Mexico , Colorado , Illinois . Carefully the price was built back to $1.27 . <P> Last week President C. M. Boggs of Kanotex Refining Co. in Arkansas City , Kans. notified the producers who supply his refinery with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kanotex Refining is an obscure factor in the industry ; without the present psychological state of crude oil producers , Mr. Boggs 's ultimatum would have attracted no attention . But oil is the only important U. S. business which in the last year has withstood Depression , and producers felt it was too good to last . More important still-despite increasing demand , proration figures have unquestionably been too high . The Petroleum Institute in April stated that 2,600,000 barrels a day ( except for California , which has no proration laws ) would be about right . The States east of California have actually been producing almost 2,700,000 barrels . As a result , refineries have built up immense inventories- 92,000,000 barrels of gasoline in March . <P> For five months the Texas Railroad Commission , which fixes Texas oil allowables , has been whittling away at the figures , in January began requiring all wells in Texas to shut down Sundays . Last week fearing that Mr. Boggs might be only the first firecracker in a package , the Texas Railroad Commission ordered all wells to shut down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which automatically cut proration figures 16% . Simultaneously the Oklahoma Corporation Commission issued an emergency order cutting allowables for the rest of May 81,000 barrels daily to 405,000 . Kansas set May daily allowables at 160,000 barrels though at the week end the other States in the Interstate Compact had not yet followed suit .
