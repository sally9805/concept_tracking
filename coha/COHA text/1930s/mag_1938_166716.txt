BOOM TOWN-Jack O'Connor-Knopf ( $2.50 ) . <P> When Ernest Hemingway created his monosyllabic prize fighters , gangsters , bull fighters , he gave U. S. writers a powerful insight into the workings of the minds of criminals , fighting men and tough characters in general . Imitators who borrowed his peculiar style soon burned themselves out , but the full impact of Hemingway 's major achievement is just beginning to make itself felt in U. S. fiction . Last week a young Arizona novelist showed what happens when the legendary heroes of the Old West-men of the cast of Wyatt Earp or Doc Holliday-are examined with an understanding gained from Hemingway 's studies of later desperadoes . They emerge as quick on the trigger as ever , but hard-up instead of heroic , dissatisfied , bewildered , trapped . Although they start shooting at the hint of an insult , they , too , eat dirt , have their human share of humiliations in the pursuit of women and wealth . <P> Peopled with the stock characters of a Western thriller , Boom Town is notable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around Frank O'Rielly , who stumbles on a silver mine , exploits it with a young Eastern assayer , gets rich , falls in love with his partner 's wife . Knocking down too many braggarts and bullies to be quite real , O'Rielly is , nevertheless , an interesting sketch , although hardly more ; he is too intelligent to fit into the brutal , amoral environment in which he lives , but even more contemptuous of the world of bankers and speculators into which his wealth lifts him . <P> Author O'Connor writes in a bold , colloquial , summarizing prose , with paragraphs trailing off into dull anticlimaxes ( " When he got so he could n't stand it any longer he 'd go into Phoenix and get blind-leaping drunk and spend too much dough and make a fool out of himself " ) . Inadequate for detailing such complex figures , as O'Rielly , this style works well in accounting for dumb , dangerous Bill Crockett , who develops from a cowboy to a highwayman , but can never understand why his companions grin knowingly or sigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known and all the men he has killed .
