Last week the Senate and House reconciled their little differences over the great Farm Bill of 1936 , wrapped it up neatly and sent it to the White House for signature . As this surprise package lay on the President 's desk , not one citizen in the U. S. knew precisely what sort of farm program would be pulled out of it . As Citizen Roosevelt read the 3,500 words of the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act , he discovered that the Secretary of Agriculture was authorized to : <P> 1 ) Pay farmers not more than $500,000,000 a year . <P> 2 ) Spend the money for purposes which Congress only hints at , for fear that a flat statement of the Act 's purpose would be unconstitutional . These purposes are , loosely , to improve soil fertility , conserve land , minimize wasteful exploitation and soil erosion and to re-establish the 1909-14 balance of purchasing power between farmers and city folk . <P> 3 ) Do what he is supposed to do in two steps . For two years he is to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thinks will " effectuate the purposes of the act , " except that he can not make contracts with them and can not pay them to effectuate the 1909-14 balance of purchasing power-both of which were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court . <P> All this did not fool Franklin Roosevelt one bit . He knew what Congress wanted : crop restriction and fat checks for farmers . Neither he nor Secretary Wallace yet knew the details of how they were going about it . As he signed the bill , he hopefully declared : " I feel that I am approving a measure which helps to safeguard vital public interests , not only for today but for generations to come . . . . Aiming at justice for agriculture . . . the plan seeks to salvage and conserve the greatest values in human life and resources with which this country is endowed . "
