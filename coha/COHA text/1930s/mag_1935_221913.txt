With everything from a cocktail to a new Scotch tart being named for Lady Alice Scott last week , the austere , technical voice of The Motor rose above the twitter and gush of London society paragraphists . Going to press too early to catch the death of Lady Alice 's father which makes it necessary to transform her marriage this week to George V 's third son from a public function at Westminster Abbey into a quiet , private affair . The Motor took a knowing Rolls-Royce-eye-view of the royal nuptials thus : <P> " Both the Duke of Gloucester and his fiance , Lady Alice Scott , are keen motorists , and it is no secret in Selkirkshire that their engagement was largely the outcome of their joint motoring trips in the beautiful Border country during the past two years . <P> " Lady Alice is a skilful and experienced driver who has driven constantly since the age of 18 , as might be expected , for she belongs to a family of motorists , one of whom , Lord Herbert Scott , is a director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of miles , both at home and abroad , notably in Kenya , where her uncle has a large estate . <P> " Her home is Bowhill in Selkirk , between which and Boughton House , the Northamptonshire residence of the Duke and Duchess of Buccleuch , her parents , she is often seen driving . <P> " At Bowhill there is accommodation for a dozen cars , but only four of them are permanently there , one of them a beautifully appointed Rolls-Royce . When the King and Queen invited Lady Alice to Balmoral , after the announcement of her engagement , she and her mother , the Duchess of Buccleuch , traveled the 200-odd miles from Selkirk in this car , and Lady Alice relieved the chauffeur at the wheel when they reached the Scottish Highlands . This Rolls-Royce belongs to Lady Alice 's eldest brother , the Earl of Dalkeith . <P> " The Earl owns also , and often drives , a Rover , also a great favorite of Lady Alice . On more than one occasion Lord Dalkeith , summoned suddenly to London , has returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than not Lady Alice is the culprit . <P> " The future Duchess of Gloucester is a very careful driver . She is not fond of speed and seldom travels at more than 30 miles an hour ; this being one of the reasons why her semi-invalid father , the Duke of Buccleuch , prefers her as a driver to any other member of his family . Another keen motorist in the family is Lord George Scott , the Duke 's youngest son , who is often seen driving along the Border roads in a 20-h.p . Armstrong Siddeley . <P> " For years Lady Alice and her sister , Lady Angela Scott , have had friendly arguments as to who is the better driver . Lady Angela is a greater lover of speed than her sister and in her Morris Isis she covers thousands of miles every year . <P> " The enthusiasm of the Duke of Gloucester for motoring is largely due to the Buccleuch family . The Earl of Dalkeith and Lord George Scott have been for years close personal friends of his , and now , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fiance 's family by car . The Duke 's favorite at the moment is a Sunbeam , and Lady Alice now knows as much about the car as the Duke himself . She has driven it often with the Duke sitting beside her , and Border rumor has it that he actually proposed in the car .
