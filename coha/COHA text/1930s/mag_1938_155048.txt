When he proudly put his name to the Social Security Act ( Aug. 14 , 1935 ) , Architect Franklin Roosevelt observed that the law was " the cornerstone in a structure which is being built , but is by no means complete . " Last year the Senate Finance Committee , beset by the clamor of other architects to improve on the plans , commissioned an Advisory Council of 25-including employers , labormen , Government officials and consumers , chairmanned by Princeton Economist James Douglas Brown-to draw up plans for rebuilding the structure . Last week the Council handed back a much amended set of blueprints , designed to repair some of Social Security 's major structural flaws . <P> A big flaw critics have pointed out in the Act is its scheme for a full reserve for old-age insurance to be built up during a long period while revenues from taxes on employers and employes exceed disbursements . By 1980 this vast coalbin is scheduled to hold a reserve of $47,000,000,000 . The effect of locking up $47,000,000,000 of public purchasing power would be highly deflationary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but lent to the Government . This means that by 1980 the Government will owe the Social Security Reserve 21% more than the present big national debt ( now $38,600,000,000 ) . * It means also that by that year the whole idea of a reserve will be no more than a piece of fancy bookkeeping , for if the Fund wants to spend any of its vast reserve it will have to call on the Government , which in turn will have to raise the money by taxes . <P> The Advisory Council , without recommending that this cumbrous bin be thrown out altogether , proposed beginning at once to shovel less coal in , shovel more coal out . Instead of upping the present tax rates of 1% on employer and 1% on employe automatically to the maximum of 3% apiece by 1949 as the Act provides , the Council advised calling a halt for " further study " after they have been upped to 1% January 1 . <P> It suggested for study : 1 ) a specific old-age-insurance trust fund with designated trustees for all receipts ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) reorganizing the fund from a full reserve into a " reasonable contingency fund , " with the Government paying in direct subsidies to balance the increasing benefits paid out . <P> To shovel coal out now , the Council would liberalize benefits all along the line . Instead of waiting until 1942 to begin monthly benefit payments and making lump sum payments to workers who reach 65 before then , it suggested moving the monthly benefits back to 1940 , making them bigger , adding annuities for wives over 65 , benefits for widows and orphans . This would reduce the burden on Social Security 's independent old-age-assistance program , * designed primarily for uninsured oldsters . <P> Further remodeling , the Council recommended : extending coverage immediately to some 2.800,000 ineligibles , including seamen , bank employes , and employes of non-profit religious and educational institutions , and by 1940 to 12,000,000 farm laborers and domestics ; a study of the " administrative and financial problems " involved in Social Security for " self-employed " citizens , principally the nation 's 32,000,000 farmers .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
