txt Disclosure yesterday at American Steel Foundries annual meeting that February operations of the - company were only 11% of capacity is in line with current expectations that first quarter earnings of rail equipment companies will be - sharply lower than for the correspondingperiod last George E. Scott , president of American Steel Foundries , said that in addition to curtailed operations , practically no inquiries for new equipment were coming in . He said , however , that the Griffin wheel division was doing somewhat better than the foundry business , operating at above 40% , and that the Verona , Fa. , plant , which makes industrial castings , is operating three or four days a week . Mr. Scott 's remarks concerning the operations of units of the company bear out the opinion that equipment companies which are aided by auxiliary lines will do relatively better m the first period than the others . American Brake Shoe The severity of the curtailment in equipment purchasing of all , sorts is illustrated by the situation for Atnerican Brake Shoe &; Foundry Co. , regarded in the trade as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past have not proved as severe as for certain other equipments . It is estimated that this company for the first quarter of 1938 will not earn the approXtmately $264,000 necessary to cover the 25-cent dividend paid on the common stock , after allowing for 51 : . % preferred requirements . While earnings may not be very far below this figure , they will make quite a drop from the $842,432 reported for the first quarter of 1937 . Brake Shoe 's earnings usually are kept fairly steady by the replacement nature of the railroad brakeshoe business , but the severe drop in traffic this year is having its effect and the other lines , such as various types of castings and forgings and brake materials for the automotive trade have followed the general business curve downward . Baldwin Beaded for Black Figures Baldwin Locomotive Works , as recently stated , appears headed for black figures in the first 1938 quarter because of large locomotive carryover and the activity of the Midvale subsidiary . American Locomotive Co. has been helped in the first part of the year by lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available until the end of the first six months . Lima seems certainly to be operating at a loss , as indicated by the small yearend backlog . Car-building divisions of the Pullman and General American Transportation companies are working on low schedules , though earnings are steadied somewhat by the transportation divisions . Pressed Steel Car and American Car &; Foundry companies likewise have very low freightcar backlogs , indicating unprofitable operations . Symington Gould Corp . is In a similar position and New York Air Brake Co. recently indicated it was running at a small loss . These results , as stated , are not unexpected in the trade , though disappointment has been voiced at the failure of the ICC 's freight-rate action to prove favorable enough to stimulate equipment buying . General business conditions and Washington 's railroad-aid plans are of paramount importance . 193 : Year-end Backlogs Off 50% A review of results for 1937 of leading equipment firms shows that while earnings for that year virtually were double those for 1936 and were within about 15% of those for 1930 , the best previous year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December 31 were only about half those of a year previous . Two other concerns reported backlogs 82% to 70% of those the year before , or somewhat better than the average , but it is probable that several manufacturers who did not report backlog figures had declines more than offsetting this small edge . An accompanying table shows relative earnings for 12 leading equipment makers and backlog figures for six . A rough idea of the comparative volume of freightcar and locomotive deliveries may be obtained from the railroad installation figures for 1937 , 1936 and 1930 : Not all the new installations were built in private shops , but the relationship between railroad-built and private-built equipment probably has not changed importantly . Ball Buying Outlook Mr. Scott also told American Steelf'oundries stockholders that he did not see any immediate prospects of improvement in the outlook for renewed buying by railroads . He said he believed the working out of Federal railroad consolidation plans ultimately might improve purchasing if it helped put the carriers in better financial shape . Unfilled orders March 11 at the foundry plants amounted to 6,875 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year ago , according to Mr. Scott . In regard to labor Mr. Scott paid a renewal of last year 's labor contract was now being negotiated with the CIO and that he anticipated no change in wage rates as a result . Regarding capital expenditures , for 1938 , Mr. Scott said that , while the budget was about the same as last year , the work would not be carried forward actively except at the Hammond , Ind. , plant , which manufacturers brakes for streamlined trains . As of March 1 new freight cars on order totaled 5,568 compared with 6,563 on February 1 and 42,212 on March 1 , 1937 , according to Association of American Railroads . During the first two months of 1938 3,478 new cars were hastened in service by the railroads , compared with 6,135 in the like period of 1937 . New steam locomotives on order March 1 totaled 101 , against 110 February 1 and 375 March 1 , 1938 . There were 26 Diesel-electric and electric locomotives on order March- 1 against ' 21 February 1 and 10 on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1938 29 new steam locomotives were installed compared with 22 in the like 1937 period ; 22 Diesel-electric and electric engines were installed in the period compared with seven in the comparable period of 1937 . Phillips Petroleum Co. has ordered 10 tank cars from General American Transportation Corp .
