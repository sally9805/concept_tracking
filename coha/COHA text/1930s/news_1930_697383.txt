txt A new route to the rescue , of the crude rubber industry , directly opposite to that taken by British planters under the ill-fated Stevenson scheme , was Fointed out by Sir Eric Geddes . chairman of the Dunlop Plantations Co .. when he said that the objective of all European producers now is to sell at a profit up to 17 cents a pound . below which price Asiatic production is discouraged . In contrast to attempts to maintain prices at a level far above the production cost of the least efficient producers by curtailing production or restricting exports , the big European planters , Sir Eric indicates , should aim at a free market in which to set about cutting their production costs so low that they will have a profitable field in a comparatively narrow price range to themselves . Scientific management and large scale production are counted on to enable the European interests to make money on rubber at a price at which native growers can not compete . Thus , the native production . which - has thus far balked all attempts at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Overproduction Problems No statistics are available as to how large this Asiatic-controlled rubber output is , but there is no doubt that it is large enough so that its elimination , or even its substantial reduction , would correct the current overproduction problem of the crude rubber industry . How long it wiPl take to effect this correction is problematical , but if Sir Eric is correct in saying that 17-cent rubber tends to discourage Asiatic produr= Lion . 9 and even S-cent rubber must be putting most native producers far " in the red . " Assurance tfint the big European . and American , plantations. properly managed , can make money in the less-crowded market under 17 cents is given by Dunlop 's statement that it Is now producing rubber on its 70.000 acres of plantations at a cost f o. b . Singapore , of less than S cents a pound , subject to depreciation . Without knowledge of Dunlop 's current depreciation charges on Its plantation properties . it is impossible to estimate the company 's all-in cost of production . The cost of transporting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liverpool . however . is generally *estimated at nearly one penny a pound English money . This means that Dunlop 's all-in cost , exclusive of depreciation . is around 10 cents a pound American money . And Sir Eric states it is hoped that these costs will soon be reduced to S cents a pound . which will be possible only in the absence of any official restriction scheme . Cut in Dunlop 's Costs Surprising It has been known for some time that a large number of the Dutch East Indies plantations were producing rubber at an all-in cost of 10 to 12 cents a pound , but the manner in which Dunlop has lowered its production costs comes as a surprise to the general public Its significance lies in the fact that with rubber in the New York and London markets at its present depressed price of around S cents a pound . against a high earlier in the year of above 22 cents a pound . Dunlop is producing at a loss of only 2 cents a. pound before depreciation Dunlop 's plantations are well managed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production costs to the present level , there seems to be little reason why other well-managed and **25;285;TOOLONG plantations can not bring their costs down to a corresponding level . Undoubtedly they will st:ceed in lowering production costs , if necessity demands . The entire situation hinges on whether economic laws are allowed to function , or whether another artificial restriction scheme , such as the Stevenson Act , is brought into play . The refusal of the Straits Settlements and the Dutch East Indies governments to take official action for restriction leads to the belief that the law of supply and demand will be allowed to function . Significance to American Tire Industry This will undoubtedly result in'severe loss to many of the eastern rubber producers and considerable mortality amongst the small , financially weak , or inefficiently managed plantations . The industry 's cure , however painful , should be lasting . Significance of the new attack on crude rubber 's problems to the American tire industry is the promise of relative price stability , barring unforeseen complications such as wars or plant diseases . The industry has suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high as S3 a pound , and even last year it varied from 15i1 to 26z .. , cents a pound . So far this year the September future has fluctuated between 7 90 and 22.50 cents . Such conditions naturally expose rubber manufacturing concerns to serious inventory losses . Sir Eric 's calculations on native production costs and the fact that a company such as Dunlop 's can produce rubber at an all-in cost , exclusive of depreciation , of about 10 cents a pound . give rise to the belief that , if no restriction measures are adopted in the Far East , native production will fall off sharply ; production will more neat ly approximate consumption : and rubber will eventually rise to the 17-cent level . where natives will once more become encouraged to begin tapping . The ultimate conclusion from his observations is that under free economic laws , rubber will probaltly rise in the future not much higher than 17 cents a pound . where , with reduced production costs , it will provide a fair profit to the grower and provide the manufacturer with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials .
