txt The sun set in Fairbanks and rose again In half an hour today . That made this the longest day in any city nywhere . There was n't any night , ler citizens of Fairbanks called a holiday , stopped all business , and devoted the 24 hours of daylight to play for the children , races and a baseball game . The ball game started at midnight . Some went to the " summit , " in cars to watch the sun go down and come right back up again . Some chose airplanes to view the spectacle . On the streets , they danced and read newspapers . Two dance halls were used , because of the crowds . Miners swarmed in from the hills to celebrate . Cowbells , horns , and other noisemakers rattled and clanged . The sun sets at midnight , but that will last only a few weeks . Slowly the nights will lengthen . During the 24 hours Irons midnight Friday to midnight.tonight , however , Fairbanks had its place in the sun  --  a 24 hour sun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
