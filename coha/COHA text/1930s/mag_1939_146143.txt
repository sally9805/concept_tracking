Professor Ralph Winfred Tyler , University of Chicago 's famed chief examiner and professor of education , believes that U. S. high schools and colleges do not teach students to think . Because pedagogues lack even the means of finding out whether students can think , Professor Tyler and colleagues spent three months thinking up a test of thinking . Last month , having excogitated 290 questions and created perhaps the most elaborate thinking test ever devised , they stunned a group of the nation 's smartest high-school graduates with it . The examinees were 1,407 high-standing students , trying for 34 University of Chicago scholarships . <P> The three-hour test roamed the fields of science , literature , economics , English , history , in unusual fashion . Examinees were asked not to display their knowledge but to draw deductions from sets of given facts . In a test of their literary judgment , for example , they were given a poem to interpret , Wallace Stevens ' Disillusionment of Ten O'Clock : <P> The houses are haunted <P> By white nightgowns . <P> None are green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green with yellow rings , <P> Or yellow with blue rings . <P> None of them are strange , <P> With socks of lace <P> And beaded ceintures . <P> People are riot going <P> To dream of baboons and periwinkles . <P> Only , here and there , an old sailor , <P> Drunk and asleep in his boots , <P> Catches tigers <P> In red weather . <P> Examinees were asked to say whether certain statements were consistent with , irrelevant to or inconsistent with the poem , e.g. : The houses are haunted by ghosts ; drunkenness is a terrible vice ; respectable people are happier than drunken sailors ; " red weather " occurs only at sunset ; there is only one drunken sailor ; life is now too uniform and standardized ( closest to the poem 's meaning ) . <P> In another test of reasoning from , economic facts , students were to tell the effect on supply , demand and the price of American wheat in the world market if a major European war broke out and agricultural wage rates in the U. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his test , found that students thought about as fuzzily as he had expected . Only 42% could make sense of the literary passages and even fewer had any notion of what Poet Stevens was driving at ; 75% believed that the poem was an argument for temperance . Similarly , the students as a group scored only 47% on literary information , 42% on scientific information . They did better ( 57% ) on a section of the test in which their memory for facts counted . Examinees were found to have many superstitions : 70% believed that daughters resemble their fathers more than their mothers ; 60% that if a dominant man marries a weak woman more than half of their children will be boys . But 97% replied correctly that " germs may be spread by kissing . " <P> Highest score was made by Chicago 's Donald Wallace Connor , who got 211 of the 290 questions . Said a less successful examinee : " Anyone who could pass that test does n't need to go to college . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
