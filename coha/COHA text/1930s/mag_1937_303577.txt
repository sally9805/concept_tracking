THIS MUST BE THE PLACE-James Charters , as told to Morrill Cody- Furman ( $3 ) . <P> Ten to 15 years ago , in the Montparnasse quarter of Paris , there were four persons known , by name at least , to the most assiduous tourist and most casual habitu . These were : Flossie Martin , plump , china-cheeked ex-show girl ; Kiki , black-haired , impish French painters ' model ; Nina Hamnett , English painter and expert on sailors ' chanteys ; Jimmy Charters , ruddy-faced and unfailingly genial barman . The four were not friends , were in fact rather rivals , each ruling a separate coterie-the ladies at their tables at the Dome , Rotonde or Select , Jimmy at whatever bar he happened to be tending at the moment . <P> Since these characters achieved prominence in a piquant period , it was to be expected that something in the way of written reminiscences would sooner or later appear . But Bohemians are notoriously lackadaisical about such matters , and though Kiki 's Memoirs ( Black Manikin Press ; Paris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith , 1932 ) have been published , it was to small audiences ; the panning of Montparnasse gold has been largely left to the more journalistically-minded . Third in the authentic train , Jimmy Charters ' narrative would be condemned forthwith as a rehashing of minor and well-chewed-over material-the renamings of expatriate celebrities ( Harold Stearns , Nancy Cunard , Homer Bevans , Ford Madox Ford ) , the retelling of the pranks , suicides , brawls that made up the life of the Quarter-were it not for the fact that Jimmy was and is a barman , and proud of it . <P> Hence there is a somewhat more workaday point of view throughout the book , and mixed in with the anecdotes , gobbets of such practical information as how to handle drunks , raucous , tearful or belligerent ; comparative analyses of drunks , male and female ; how to tell when a fight is brewing and how to stop it . Collectors of contemporary Americana should note that the book contains an introduction by Ernest Hemingway . Largely made up of veiled , bitter aspersions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only too apparently another reply to Gertrude Stein 's strictures on Hemingway in her Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas ( 1933 ) .
