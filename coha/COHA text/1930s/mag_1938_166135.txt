Chasing wild geese is so unrewarding it has become a proverb . Ornithologists have long gritted their teeth over the mystery of where the Blue Geese ( Chen caerulescens ) go in spring . From their winter quarters in the secluded swamp-lands of lower Louisiana the geese fly north so far and fast they literally disappear into the blue . But in 1929 a Canadian naturalist and explorer named Dr. Joseph Dewey Soper at last found a happy ending to his wild-goose chase . He traced the geese into the remote fastness of Baffin Island , deep in the Canadian Northeast , discovered their nesting place . <P> Last week , as they started their annual southern flight , the geese made news again that thinned out into another mystery : Royal Canadian Mounted Police , Eskimos and Indians reported that the geese had almost no young birds with them , although about 50% of the southbound flocks are usually goslings . Possible explanation : The nestlings were struck by an eastern Arctic storm which only the older birds were able to escape .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
