txt Isadore Blumenfeld ( Kid Cann ) was acquitted tonight of the murder of Walter Liggett , editor of a weekly newspaper here . The jury was out three and a half hours when it reported back that it had reached an agreement . Governor Olson , apprised that Cann had been acquitted , issued a statement that the State Bureau of Criminal Apprehension " will not rest " until Mr. Liggett 's murderers have been caught . A handful of spectators , mostly friends of Blumenfeld , was in the court room when the verdict was returned and there was a momentary celebration . The defendant 's wife , in tears , covered her face with her hands as the jury 's verdict of not guilty was read . " I was sure they knew I was innocent , " Cann said after he heard the verdict . His friends said he would leave the city within a day or so and probably go to Florida . Mrs. Liggett heard of the verdict without immediate comment . She said she might have a statement later . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the " leering , grinning " gunman who slew her husband as she watched helplessly that the former bootlegger was brought to trial . Mrs. Liggett Accuses Police . Later she charged that four members of the Police Department " perjured themselves in their successful effort to win freedom " for Blumenfeld . " Murder of an enemy of Floyd B. Olson is hardly a crime in Minneapolis , " the widow said . " Beyond lying whole-heartedly for their lifelong associate , Blumenfeld , the Minneapolis police force has done nothing. ? ' The reference was made in connection with four officers , called by the defense , who testified that the widow , immediately after her husband was slain , declared " either Governor Olson 's mob or Kid Cann got my husband . " The jurors , eight men and four women , had received the case from Judge Arthur W. Selover after a forty-five-minute charge in which they were instructed to return a verdict of guilty or not guilty . It was a dramatic scene in the court room as the case came to a close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began delivering his instructions , and a dozen armed deputy sheriffs in plain clothes were scattered among the spectators . They had been ordered in by Sheriff John P. Wall , who refused to explain the reason for their presence . Judge Deals With Alibi . Earlier in the day Mrs. Liggett had heard her identification of Blumenfeld as her husband 's slayer ' dismissed by a defense attorney , Thomas , as " another common mistake of identity . " The defendant 's wife approvingly smiled as she heard her husband 's alibi , that he was in a barber shop seventeen blocks away at the moment Liggett was machine-gunned to death , 5:41 P. M. on Dec. 9 , presented by his counsel as " not only honest but conclusive . " Judge Selover had a few words for the alibi in his charge , which dealt mainly with points of law and a review of the evidence . Of the alibi he said : " You are instructed that an alibi is a good defense if supported by credible evidence which negatives or raises a reasonable doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a defense which is easy to fabricate and . hard to disprove , and you are cautioned to terutinize it with care . " Frederick A. Pike , Assistant Attorney General , in adding up the State 's arguments , centered his final attack on the alibi , the credibility of the witnesses supporting it and the identification of Blumenfeld by Mrs. Liggett and Wesley Andersch , another eyewitness to the murder . " The issue in this case , " he said , " reduced to its last analysis is the issue of identification versus alibi . If identification by either of the two eyewitnesses has been established the alibi can not be true . The 70-year-old prosecutor also went over the gap he opened yesterday in the alibi in discrediting the barber shop testimony , and told the jury . that " there was plenty of time " for the murder trip : " We have here , " he concluded , " the messenger of the dark background of the lawless life of the city , riding with death to slay his victim , scoffing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spurious alibi .
