Into his father 's office , from whose walls a row of New Deal dignitaries look down , David ( " Tommy " ) Stern 3rd moved last week , becoming general manager of Philadelphia 's rambunctious Record . Short , red-faced , 28 and popping with ideas , Tommy Stern intimately resembles his father in appearance and energy . For many a moon he has been itching to have a paper all his own , has bid for the Harrisburg Telegraph and Providence Star-Tribune . Now he has agreed to stay put for a year on the Record . If Tommy proves as big as his job , J. David Stern Sr. will be able to turn nearly all his attention to his New York Post , which in four years he has boosted from 86,000 circulation to nearly 300,000 , by tooting one of the loudest horns on the Roosevelt bandwagon and by giving away ( for coupons and cash ) a steady stream of dictionaries , atlases , Dickens ' works and medical advice books .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
