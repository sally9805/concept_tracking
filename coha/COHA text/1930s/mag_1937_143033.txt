Major tenet of modern life underwriting is counsel and service to the insured-no high-pressure methods such as some salesmen use to sell anybody anything for a commission . Appreciating that self-criticism in business is as healthy as it is unusual , the 1,500 delegates in Denver 's Broadway Theatre voiced approval as Mr. Patterson went on : " We have allowed to come in and remain in our business a horde of men unsuited and unfit for life insurance selling . ...

North of Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. who announced the establishment of a $30,000 co-operative fund for underwriter education through the American College of Life Underwriters . Purpose : " To organize and make available in an organized manner the information which men heretofore entering the business have had to pick up largely in an unorganized manner .
