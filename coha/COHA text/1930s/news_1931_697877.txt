txt Next month 's electric light bills will be higher or lower than usual in thousands of New York homes because of new rates ordered yesterday by the Public Service Commission . Consumers to be affected include all served by the New York and the Brooklyn Edison Companies , by the United Electric Light and Power Company ; and by the New York and Queens Electric Light and Power Company . Householders whose bills have been , on the average , less than $1.96 a month will find that sum increased . Those who have paid $1.96 or more will now pay less . Small commercial users will also pay more in some cases , though not in as great numbers as residence users . Large commercial users will find their bills decreased . ? About 50 per cent of residence users will pay more than -t present and 50 per cent will pay less , the commission estimated . The $1.96 dividing line is based on an average of 7 cents per kilowatt-hour , which closely approximates the slightly varying rates of the four companies under consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the same time , the new schedules are so adjusted that the four companies involved , the commission estimates , will lose revenues of more than $5,500,000 a year . The companies will nevertheless accept the revised rates , it was announced , in the hope that increased use of current by those favored in the price readjustment will more than make up for the loss of income . Other features of the rate ruling were the fixing of a minimum payment of $1 a month for all users , the establishment of uniform rates for the companies involved , the rejection of their demand , made last year , for a 60-cents-a-month meter charge , and the establishment of conditions which , it is believed , will discourage sub-metering of current by landlords to tenants . The announcement that a ruling had been made by the commission , which began consideration of the matter nearly a year ago , came from Milo R. Maltbie , chairman , in his office at the State Office Building , 80 Centre Street . A statement that the companies would accept was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two , schedules are included : in the new rates , one being applicable to residences and the , other ' to ' places where current is used ' commercially . Summarized , the schedules follow : Residences  --  Minimum charge , $1 a month , for which the consumer is entitled to 10 kilowatt-hours of current . Energy charge , 6 cents for each of the next 5 kilowatt- watt hours they will be decreased , sometimes in substantial amounts . Argument as to Small Users . The argument on which the higher price for small users was sustained , according to the decision , is that the return from this class of customers sometimes does not pay the cost of furnishing service . Included in the group are many so-called " convenience users , " who should be willing to pay for the privilege of having electrical current at their disposal on the occasions when they wish to use it , in the opinion of the commission . Had the meter charge proposal of the companies been put through the percentage of those to pay increased bills would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay smaller bills would have been about 41 , the commission estimated , pointing out that its schedules give a more equal distribution . This proposal of increased rates for a large percentage of small users had been attacked at the commission 's hearings by the city and by representatives of many organizations . The minimum charge had a much better " psychological effect " on the consumer than the meter charge , the commission concluded . Frowns on Current Resale . In the part of its ruling dealing with the resale or submetering of current , the commission declared that it did not look with favor upon resale . A further clause of the ruling prohibits the purchase of current for resale at.residence rates , forcing purchase at commercial , which the commission believes will not be profitable except in cases where large amounts of current are used . The decision , written by Mr. Maltbie , was adopted just before it was made public . The vote by Commissioners George R. , Neil Brewster and Maurice C. Burritt was unanimous . Commissioner George R. Lunn was absent'because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ruling pointed out . If they - do not accomplish the purpose of reducing rates , the decision said , further reductions will be ordered . In the matter of a coal surcharge asked by the companies , the commission pointed out that coal is now so low that its price can have no effect on costs for a year at least . Sloan Sees Step Forward . The company 's approval of the rates is based on their so-called promotional feature-that of inducing greater consumption of current . In his statement Mr. Sloan estimated that the initial loss of revenue to , the companies would be around $6,000 , - 000 , rather than the $5,500,000 figure set by the commission . " By these rates , " his statement said , " the commission endorses our contention that occasional and convenience users of electricity should pay in proportion to the cost of serving them and the regular , liberal users should pay the lower prices their use earns .
