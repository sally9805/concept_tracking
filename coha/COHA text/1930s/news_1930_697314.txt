txt In 1920 , according to the Health Department 's statement on the shrinking margin between birthrates and death-rates , New York City 's natural increase was 10% per 1,000 of the population . Last year the gain was only 7 per 1,000 . This would mean that ten years ago the natural addition to the city 's population was about 58,000 ; last year , it was about 50,000 , and in the intervening years it was an average between these two " numbers . Altogether the city 's gain in the decade would have been roughly about 550,000 by excess of births over deaths , leaving immigration from foreign . countries and from the United States to account for the additional 765,000 increase irhplied in the two Federal censuses . Health Commissioner WYNNE suggests that we are approaching the state of things now prevalent ii he big German cities , where the excess of births- over deaths has virtually disappeared , or , as in the case of Berlin , the death-rate has actually outstripped the birth-rate in the last ' three years i We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it may be a matter of not much more than a decade . In twenty years the margip has thinned from 11 per 1,000 of the population to 7 . The shrinkage has been held down by the remarkable results obtained in cutting down the deathrate while the birth-rate has been falling . Such impressive triumphs over death can not continue at anything like the same rate , since the Victories have ' been almost entirety in reducing infant mortality . Most of the diseases that took heavy toll of young life are now under control , while the death-rate in middle age and beyond is showing , if anything , a tendency to rise . The extraordinary results obtained in the reduction of the death-rate have drawn attention away from serious implications in the toboganning birth-rate . Easily and unarithmetically , we have assumed , in face of a universally recognized decline in births , that we could indefinitely go on making up deficits by combating mortality . But it has got to the point where students of population are asserting that the Western nations , having in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fertility , are even now not reproducing themselves . The falling birth-rate is a worldwide and steadily advancing phenomenon . It is nevertheless subject to local and periodic fluctuation . Economic conditions usually count . The Health Department 's figures for twenty-one Japanese towns , for instance , show a rise from 27.6 in 1926 to 32.1 in 1928 , which would probably reflect the country 's recovery from the terrible earthquake of 1923 . So the situation in the German towns , with a birth-rate nearly 20 per cent lower than in the French cities , would measure the comparative state of prosperity in frE the two countries . Within each country there is a striking rate of variation between Paris with a birth-rate of 15 and Rouen with- 22.6 , or between Berlin with 9.6 and Leipzig with 12.6 . Where the birth-rate is obviously so subject to fluctuation it is not impossible that its decline may be checked or even reversed over a period of years by sufficiently powerful economic or moral forces .               @ @ @ @ @ @
