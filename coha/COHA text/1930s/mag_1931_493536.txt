Unemployment Relief by Business I WHEN TIMES were booming , back in 1929 and before , the XYZ Company employed over two thousand men . It expanded by purchasing a plant in Pennsylvania and another in the Middle West . It encouraged its employees to buy stock at $30 a share ? a price that was then 20 percent below the market . The company now employs less than a thousand men and its stock is quoted on the New York Exchange at less than $4 a share . Some of its plants are shut down and others are working one or two days a week . This company is not able to help its employees because , when times were good , it set aside no reserves for that purpose . It has even stopped the pensions of some of its retired workers and has reduced the pensions of others from 25 to 50 percent . It is requiring its employees to keep up payment on their stock by making deductions from their pay checks . In several towns where the company has plants there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a company official , destitute employees in these towns " must go back to the farm or starve . " Here we have epitomized , in a mildly exaggerated form , the way in which unprepared American industry meets depression . To nine out of ten employers , the relief of unemployment is not a responsibility of industry . In fact , inquiry at the Chambers of Commerce or Associated Charities in several large cities elicited the advice that relief by private concerns was so negligible that it would not be worth while to search for instances . But despite these facts , far more enterprises are engaged in un'employment relief during this depression than in any previous one . Furthermore , the concerns giving relief are among the most prominent in industry ? companies whose policies are usually imitated . It is desirable to examine what is being done and how it is being done , and to see what conclusions of general significance emerge from the examination of specific cases . The A Company manufactures automobile accessories . During the last winter its output was about one-third of normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the fall of 1930 , the management , believing that there were needy cases among its men of which it was not aware , asked its personnel department to investigate . A visit was made to the home of every employee who was making less than $18 a week and , in addition , calls were made on many men who had recently been laid off but who had worked for the company for at least one year . Several thousand calls were made in all . The company arranged to purchase coal , shoes and clothing at wholesale prices and , in addition , it encouraged working employees to bring in clothing . Some funds came from the accumulated profits of the Employees ' Exchange , which sells candy , tobacco , etc. , to the men . The company matched every dollar spent . The total expenditures were $20,000 and the number of cases aided was over 200 . In most instances , the help took the form of credit , but in some it was an outright gift . The company has used its own people instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has been necessary to hire some outside supervision . The exterior of the plant was painted , windows were cleaned , floors repaired . About all that can be done has been done and it will be almost impossible to provide any " made work " during the coming winter . The B Company is . a maker of steel . During this depression it has made few lay-offs , but has rationed work , giving most employment to the men in the worst circumstances . It has provided little " made work " because the plants are in such good condition that it is hard to find even a job for a floor sweeper . The company is caring for some people who have not had a day 's work for two years . These people are not given money , but they are furnished food , clothing and medical attention . Assistance is always given outright , never in the form of credit , because the company fears that if the men become heavily indebted to it , many of them might move away and it would lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few houses , but it does not collect rent unless the tenant can pay without great hardship . Some employees have not paid rent for eighteen months . " It is better for us , " said the personnel manager , " to have the houses occupied than vacant . " The company is encouraging its employees to have gardens . The best record has been made in a community where about 320 of its 2,000 employees have gardens on company land . The company furnishes the seed and plows the land . Every two weeks the gardens are inspected to see that they are properly cared for . In a small town in Pennsylvania where the company has a plant , it has been keeping 400 families for nearly two years . The gardens are helping some . Near this town is some coal land owned by an affiliated concern on which the men were given per ? mission to dig coal from the outcrops . The day before my visit 125 men had dug 160 tons . They had no way of hauling the coal , so the plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance of about three miles . The C Company is a small rolling mill specializing on high-grade plate work . It has not laid off any men , but the force has dropped by resignations from 850 two years ago to about 750 now . The work has been divided as equally as possible among the men . This has meant that during the last year they have averaged about 40 percent of full time . A number have supplemented their incomes by a few days ' work on truck farms or in the canning factories in the neighborhood . In past years the men have conducted a Community Chest campaign in the shop and the company has added a contribution which slightly exceeded that of the men . This year the personnel manager is wondering whether to permit a Community Chest campaign . He feels that under the equal-division-of-work plan the men have already contributed far more than their share to unemployment relief . On the day that I visited the plant , the United States Steel Corporation announced its 10-percent wage cut . The president was pondering what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ licking without any cut , " he said . He was obviously most reluctant to cut , but he feared that competition would compel him to do so . The D Company is one of the world 's largest manufacturers of heavy machinery . In November , 1930 , its force was about 12,500 . The first thing that the company did was to let out the inefficient and the short-service men ? about 800 in all . Then it began spreading the work . It was helped in doing so by the fact that it has pursued the policy of transferring men between departments and has developed a number of general-purpose men . The works manager soon discovered , however , that some men were being favored . Consequently , he appointed a committee to check the pay roll every two weeks in order to prevent favoritism . Business continued to drop , and during the fall of 1930 and the winter of 1931 the company cut its staff by 700 . In order to help those in distress , the men through entertainments and gifts raised about $27,500 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were doing , it matched their contributions . That continued until the summer , when the contributions of the workers dropped . Then the company authorized the personnel department to spend each month until the end of the year as much as it had been spending . The outlay for relief is now about $7,000 a month . The company is carry . ing approximately 500 families , but the personnel manager says that the number could be increased to 750 without abusing the relief . Most of the 500 are employees who were laid off , but some are men who are working part time . The E Company is a large steel producer . It has made few lay-offs , but has attempted to adjust the work to the needs of the men . This has not been easy because there has been little work to ' divide . At the time of my visit , the company was operating at 28 percent of capacity . The personnel manager says that half his time is spent in talking with men who are ' dissatisfied with the share that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been seeing an employee who had had only three turns in six weeks . The man has two boys , his wife has tuberculosis , and he is attempting to pay for a house . The company attempts to provide " made work , " but high standards of maintenance make this difficult . The management prefers to give credit rather than charity . Many employees are not paying rent in company houses , but it is expected that they will pay up in gradual instalments later . The company has sold many houses to its employees and payments on these are badly behind . In some cases the men are keeping up the interest , but in many they are not . The company tries to insist that they pay the taxes . A high official thinks that in the future the company should provide reserves against unemployment . " If every employer provided his own fund and took care of his own people , " this official said , " we would not have this trouble . In the future most good corporations will provide money to take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have to anyway , because we shall get the ' dole ' as sure as the devil . " The F Company is another large producer of steel . During the 1921 depression its force dropped from 72,000 to 30,000 , but in this depression the company has rationed work . In August , 1931 , its force was 61,000 in comparison with 70,000 in October , 1929 . This drop was due almost entirely to resignations . " Lay-off , " said an important official , " is the easiest way of taking care of a drop in orders . Rationing presents real problems , but after a time , we found that it is not so hard as we : thought it would be . " Rationing has meant so little employment for many men that the company has arranged with the welfare agencies in each community to inform it of distress among its employees . If the trouble is shortage of wages , it gives the men more working time . This necessitates taking work from other men and means that the real burden falls upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company has its own stores and there it gives credit . A plant-personnel manager said : " Personally , I do n't believe in company stores , but during this depression our store here has been a godsend . " A general officer said : " Several years ago people were saying that the steel industry would be the last to adopt the five-day week . It had just got rid of the seven-day week . But in working out the part-time problem , under force of necessity , we have gone to the five-day week . We can not say that it is permanent , but we have learned enough so that we can operate five days . " What general conclusions can we draw from these cases and from many others covered in my survey ? First and possibly most conspicuous is the fact that the relief given by business enterprises is largely confined to so-called " regular " employees and does not reach the class which needs it most . When one asks the head of almost any business what his concern has done to meet the depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The first thing we did was to lay off all workers whom we did not regard as real Blank and Company em , ployeesmen who had been with us for less than a year . Then we divided the work among those who were left . " This means that the 7,000,000 or more unemployed are , for the most part , persons - for whom no particular enterprise feels any particular responsibility . They are industry 's flying squadron , the men who are shifted hither and yon to meet peaks in the demand for labor . Thus we have the paradoxical situation that industry feels a more or less strong responsibility for its regular and long-service employees ? to whom it is able to give fairly steady work ? but little responsibility for its labor reserve ? the men who bear the brunt of industrial fluctuations . The situation is illustrated by the experience of a large manufacturer of machinery which between October , 1929 , and August , 1931 , cut its force from 12,500 to 8,900 . This change was accomplished by dropping short-service workers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees of two years ' service or over than in October , 1929 . Second , the rationing of work , although more widely practised than ever before , is still the exception rather than the rule . In a Middle Western city the Chamber of Commerce formed a committee of influential executives to visit every enterprise and personally to " sell " the idea of rationing . Nevertheless , in only 90 cases out of 300 was rationing being practised . Reports to the President 's Emergency Committee on Employment last spring showed that about two-thirds of the men working were employed full time . Subsequently , there has been a spread of rationing , but it is safe to say that even today over half the men who have jobs are working full time . Third , the policy of rationing work , though superior to lay-offs , means that many men bear an unfair share of the burden of depression . Thousands of steel and automobile workers , for example , are . . giving up over half their income in order that others may have work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the less needy in order to provide more employment for those in distress . In effect , it means that the man who has been thrifty and has managed well has his savings confiscated and turned over to those who did not save . This is penalizing thrift with a vengeance . Fourth , part-time work does not mean that relief is not needed . As a matter of fact , when employment drops to two or three days a week , a large amount of relief may be required . Much of the relief given by the enterprises studied in this survey went to men who were working part time . A survey of 1,305 men receiving aid from the city of Detroit disclosed that 207 had jobs . This did not mean that these men were defrauding the city . It simply meant that two or three days of employment a week are not sufficient to support a familyof five or six children , particularly when the opening of school requires that shoes and clothing be pur , chased and the coming of winter necessitates laying in coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than outright aid . Sixth , well managed companies with high standards of maintenance find it . exceedingly difficult to provide private " made work , " unless they have new construction projects which they can initiate . Seventh , much of the so-called " made work " does not really represent additional employment . It is simply maintenance work performed by employees of the plant rather than by outsiders who would normally be hired to do it . Eighth , the enterprises which lay off the most men and make the most drastic cuts in hours are , of course , those which are hardest hit by the depression . Consequently , they are often unable , or feel unable , to give much relief . But many concerns which have been hard hit by the depression were exceedingly prosperous during the boom . It is plain that the accumulation of funds to relieve unemployment must occur during boom times . Ninth , although business is beginning to admit that unemployment is a responsibility of industry , relief is still based on need rather than on unemployment , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of right . The National Associa , tion of Manufacturers recently opposed public unemployment insurance on the ground , among others , " that it is arbitrary in its exemptions . " But nothing could be more arbitrary than relief by private business . Each company is free to make its own rules , but many make no rules at all and relief is determined by some official 's estimate of the needs of the particular employee . Rarely do the employees participate in administering relief and in no instance is there.an impartial and independent agency to determine the justice of individual claims . From this examination of corporate relief in operation , the conclusion irresistibly follows that the most businesslike and the fairest way to provide against unemployment is through the establishment of reserve funds administered by business enterprises in accordance with rules prescribed by the government . Such reserves and rules are needed in order that relief may be more nearly adequate and that it may reach ' the men who are most in need of help , but who now are promptly laid off as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be given as a matter of right rather than favor and on the basis of rules publicly determined rather than on the basis of private discretion . One of the most encouraging signs of the times is that industry itself is beginning to concede that unemployment reserves are sound in principle . Recently a referendum of the United States Chamber of Commerce endorsed " voluntary " unemployment reserves , and the National Association of Mannfacturers at its last convention , though opposing " public " unemployment insurance , endorsed " private " schemes by urging " deduction from taxation of reserves or expenditures to provide unemployment reserves . " But the attempt to draw a line between voluntary and compulsory reserves is a quibble . If , as the National Association of Manufacturers declares , " unemployment imposes a grave responsibility on all employers ... to contribute . to unemployment relief , " surely those who fail to discharge this responsibility should be compelled to do SO .
