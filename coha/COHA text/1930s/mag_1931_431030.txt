THE joy of a garden does not lie in its size or its cost . A little garden lovingly tended often brings more happiness than lordly acres planned and planted by hired experts . The true gardener likes the smell and touch of garden soil . He likes to feel earth in his hands . He enjoys even the strenuous labor of spading and cultivating . To him the miracle of color and form unfolding from seeds and bulbs becomes more thrilling each year . Added to these is the pleasure of variety . In even the smallest plot new plants , new arrangements , new seasonal effects , may be tried out . At this season of the year , when I , like most gardeners , am planning for next summer , my greatest thrill comes from seeking out new varieties of old favorites . Take the commonest flower of them all ? the gay , accommodating petunia . A year or two ago we were introduced to largeflowered , fringed petunias ? both single and double ? with deep throats and brilliant colors . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? should try these . Recently I have seen two other new varieties which I especially like . One is Petunia Hybrida Nana , Cockatoo , a lowgrowing , upright plant about eight inches high , holding its flowers jauntily erect . 114 It is easily grown from seed and is suitable for both borders and beds . Another , tall and spreading , useful for boxes and for beds , is called Queen of the Market . Its color is an unusual deep carmine . Dwarf ageratum is indispensable as a low edging for borders , and a new variety which has flowers of good size that completely cover the plants will please every one who tries it . It is Ageratum Blue Cap . Quite the prettiest new pansy I have seen is Mrs. Pierre S. du Pont , a giant longstemmed blossom of pure golden apricot blushed with salmon . This variety flowers profusely through a long season . Sweet peas are one of my enthusiasms , perhaps because I have had unusually good luck with them . One of the secrets of success is to dig the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil , leaving a trench a foot or more in width . Then throw in old stable litter , or sheep or cattle fertilizer sold by seedmen , and spade this under in the bottom of the trench . Then replace the top soil . Sow the seeds from one to two inches apart , and cover an inch deep . I have chosen three new sweet peas to try out this year . The first is the Burpee , soft chamoiscerise suffused salmon , an entirely new color in sweet peas . This variety was awarded a silver medal at the 1:930 trials of the Scottish Sweet Pea Society . And Scotch gardeners know sweet peas ! Ruffled Orchid , which received honorable mention by the National Sweet Pea Society of England , is a mellow lavenderpink resembling the color of some orchids . The flowers are nicely ruffled and frilled . Fire , which is a flaming red illumined by a glow of scarlet-cerise , is sunproof and often produces five-flowered sprays . The only complaint one can make against zinnias is that one grows impatient waiting for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome new Early Wonder zinnias , which produce flowering plants just forty-five days from the time the seed is planted . If you have a low border or a bed for cutting , you will want pompon zinnias . They grow only fifteen inches high and have full , double , miniature flowers quite like their giant relatives except in size . A new hardy carnation , double and very much like the florist 's flower , may easily be grown in the garden from seed . It was originated in western New York . The plants bear as many as a hundred flowers , all with good , stout , straight stems . Lovers of annual larkspur will be unusually interested in three recent arrivals ? Miss California , Los Angeles , and Carmine King . The first one , deep pink on salmon  | ground , is especially desirable because of its strong , upright plants , resembling the perennial delphiniums . They have double flowers on tall , compact , very long spikes . The other two new annual larkspurs are attractive because of their colors ? Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carmine . If you need more color in your perennial garden throughout the summer , try Anthernis Tinctoria , Perry 's variety , which has pretty , daisy-like , golden blossoms and grows about two feet high . A much-admired perennial which is constantly being improved is veronica . This year 's debutante is Veronica Lougiflora Subsessilis , a stately hardy plant about two feet high , bearing tall spikes of deep purple flowers . All of the flowers I have mentioned so far may be grown from seed , but if you want the unique new delphinium hybrids to rear their long spikes of unusually large blossoms in your garden , you must buy plants . Named varieties are sold at about three dollars per plant . I am particularly attracted to Mrs. Foster Cunliff , a tri-colored blossom with the outer petals a delicate shade of blue , inner petals mauvepink , and a striped black center . Plants at fifty cents each will bring you the beautiful long-spurred hybrid aquilegias in colors ranging through the blues , pink , scarlet , lavender , and creamy white .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
