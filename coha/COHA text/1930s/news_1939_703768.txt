txt Signs increased today that the little island of Guam , only one of the Marianas owned by the United States , is going to be a subject of spirited debate when the bill to establish a chain of aviation , submarine , destroyer and mine bases comes to the floor of the House , probably before the end of this month . This tiny American possession , which the navy proposes to convert into an impregnable outpost , is already a major topic of discussion in governmental circles because of the position taken by certain high civilian officials that its fortification might occasion an angry protest from Japan , many of whose mandated possessions are almost in sight of this mid-Pacific rock . Guam is almost solid rock for its entire thirty miles of length , and its four to eight miles in width . In the State Department approval of the Guam project is not unanimous .
