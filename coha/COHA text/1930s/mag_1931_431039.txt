 | ALONG the fifty-sixth parallel of latitude in Canada . from the Rocky Mountains to Labrador , stretches the last American frontier . North of this slowly advancing border extends a vast , unexploited wilderness , one-third as large as the United States , in which there is neither highway nor railroad . Flowing northward through this region into the Arctic Ocean is the great Mackenzie River system , with its far-reaching lakes and rivers distributed over a vast watershed . Ranking second in size to the Mississippi River system in North America , this is the Arctic highway ( see map , page 132 ) . During eight months of the year the waters of the Mackenzie River system are blocked by ice . In the few remaining months of open water the year 's supplies for the inhabitants of the region must be transported to the distant posts scattered along the lakes and rivers to the Arctic Ocean . A few steamboats handle the bulk of the traffic . Away from the traveled routes , the airplane overshadows the ancient supremacy of the canoe. * UP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of steel on the Clearwater River , in northern Alberta , as Dr. George Rebec and I stowed three months ' supplies of hard-tack and bacon into our canoe for our 1800-mile voyage to the Arctic Ocean . Northbound , Mounted Police , prospectors , traders . trappers , missionaries , and tourists swarmed the river front at Waterways , all haunted by the need for haste . While Doctor Rebec protestingly furnished a luncheon for the mosquitoes , I glanced at that colorful enchantress , a modern map . A month before it had encouragingly invited us to have a look at the Arctic Ocean . Not that I wanted to see the ocean . It was the route leading there that interested me . In the next three months we were to traverse wind-swept lakes , descend the treacherous rapids of the Slave , cut through the Arctic Circle , cross the snowy passes of the northern Rockies , and go through the territories of seven semicivilized Indian nations still dependent for existence upon the uncertain harvest of the fisheries and the chase . It was late afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the juncture with the sediment-laden Athabaska , whose waters form America 's most southerly feeder of the Arctic Ocean . Fed by the frozen beds of the Columbia Ice Field , * the Athabaska here appeared to Doctor Rebec comparable to the St. Lawrence , but it proved shallow . Everywhere our paddle jabbed sand .  | After dodging rain squalls for three hours , we sighted foundry buildings and steamboat ways extending into the river , 17 miles below the mouth of the Clearwater ? the Tar Island shipyard , wintering place for the steamboats that ply the Athabaska and the Slave rivers during the summer . A mining expedition camping there hailed us and we went ashore . A GIRL DESPOT RULES IN MAN 'S LAND The mining party of five men had been for several hours prior to our arrival under the despotic rule of an attractive 19-yearold girl , who was sole caretaker in her father 's absence . As she was the only white girl on the lower Athabaska and the only one that we were to see all summer , Mildred 's woodchopping and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I immediately adopted her as a sister , and thus escaped work ; so most of the tasks fell to John and Stan , youngest members of the mining expedition . We signed a compact with the mining explorers to accompany them as far north as Resolution , on Great Slave Lake , where they planned to prospect on the Taltson River . Our flotilla consisted of a skiff towing three canoes . In less than three hours the next day we ran into MacKay , the largest trading post in the 150-mile stretch between  | the Clearwater and Lake Athabaska . From the high bank the tepees of the Chipewyans and the Bush Crees , grouped about the weather-worn trading store , looked down upon the river . We stopped only for a few minutes to give our greetings to Indian children and young men in colored shirts , unpressed suits , and beaded moccasins covered with rubbers . All day we cruised wet to the skin , in a cold rain , under soggy , leaden clouds . Dirty blocks of ice still choked the mouths of the creek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cabin . A SAND BAR OCCASIONS AN ICY BATH Toward sundown the following day we entered the delta region and in a few minutes the whole flotilla stuck hard and fast on a bar . For a half hour we struggled up to our waists in the icy current before we got back into the channel again . Despite the cold . which seemed part of the gathering dusk , it was splendid cruising . for the wilderness became enchanting with the appearance of the stars . On t h e river bends and hanging over the swamps were mists which the Crees call the spirits of the dead . Good weather came at daybreak , when a fresh south wind stirred trees and flowers . On the edge of the forest a few birds . part of t h e hundred species that migrate to the northern limit of the wooded country every summer , were singing to the dawn . We stopped for several hours at midday at the log cabin of a 79-year-old trapper and fisherman who had not been o u t of the country for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Athabaska , the current slipped off into many channels among alluvial islands , and we cruised a vast marsh where willows waved along a flat horizon . Down one of these tributaries we saw those low , rolling hills which had inspired Mackenzie , and other fur traders who first cruised these northern waters , to call Athabaska the " Lake of the Hills . " Here one of the continent 's largest inland fisheries is carried on mainly by white employees of two Edmonton companies , becattse the Indians are not dependable workers . The Indians work contentedly until one of their own race comes along in a canoe with an idea ; then they will all pack up and leave in a few minutes .  | @# @# The expedition put in the morning sounding with paddles for a channel o f sufficient depth to admit us into Lake Athabaska . At noon the wind freshened through the green marsh grass , and the lake became too rough for crossing ; so we went to sleep in our boats and canoes . The sun w a s now setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a light . When the Doctor awakened me at 3 a. m. , the sky in the east was red , with a chill easterly wind blowing . WHERE MACKENZIE BEGAN HIS VOYAGE I started ahead of the skiff , determined to explore t h e delta mouths as far as Chipewyan . The depth was remarkably uniform , and for several miles the floor of the lake slid by under eight inches of water . To the north , clumps of trees on the distant shore seemed to hang in the s k y , mirages characteristic of these northern lakes . By noon I had paddled the canoe several miles from shore , with the wind increasing to a gale . Trapped in pounding breakers on this shallow flat , I was obliged to sop tip with a towel the water that splashed over the gunwales . It was hours before I was able to ride a heavy following sea into Chipewyan . The sight of the town 's whitewashed buildings gave me a strange thrill , for it was from this fort 's predecessor , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun his voyage to the Polar Sea more than 140 years before ( see illustration , page 141 ) . The tall tepees of two large encampments of Chipewyans and Crees fired my imagination . This was the time for feasting and dancing . The Indians formed rings around their night fires and danced until early morning to the beat of tom-toms and the loud , monotonous chant of the drummers . When I pointed my camera at the Indian children , they would cry , " Look out , he is going to shoot you , " and fly in alarm . While I was camped on the beach , waiting for the expedition to overtake me , the dogs ran away with my frying pan and plates . A half-breed child thought it was a great joke on the dogs , because they would dent @#  | their teeth when they tried to eat the frying pan . DOCTOR REBEC SPEAKS ON DOMINION DAY Heading toward the Riviere-des-Rochers , we struck the wrong channel and encountered heavy breakers on a shallow flat . We were windbound until late afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went to sleep . By sundown we had passed the mouth of Peace River g.nd camped on a small rock island in the Slave River . Here the Doctor gave us a stirring Dominion Day address . Doctor Rebec , though only a month away from his duties as dean of the Graduate School at the University of Oregon , was absorbing the spirit of his surroundings . When not delighting in the heavens mirrored in the sluggish Slave , he wastefully chewed sticks from the 50o packages of gum that we had brought to give to the Indians in return for photographic poses . Ninety-three miles below Chipewyan , as the red roofs of Fitzgerald loomed up on the left shore , a whirlpool twisted our canoe and almost swamped it . It was the first indication of the famous rapids that L TO THE POLAR SEA 133 stretch northward from this point for i6 miles to Fort Smith , forming the only impassable barrier between the Clearwater and the Arctic Ocean . The expedition portaged here by trucks to Fort Smith , while Stan enthusiastically agreed to accompany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paced off the portages . On our departure we were joined by Dan , a young Hudson 's Bay clerk . Paddling across to the mouth of the Dog River , we came to the first rapids . Dan took the camera and prepared to snap us lining the canoe over the first fall . Stan 's feet skidded on a slippery rock and he flew into the air and landed with a great splash in the mud . I shouted excitedly for Dan to snap the shutter , but Dan was too much of a gentleman to embarrass Stan ! A short distance below we had two long carrying places , the second strewn with broken sweeps and decayed rollers , remnants of the Hudson 's Bay scow brigades . Mosquitoes with the spirit of a civic welcoming committee clouded the air along the trail and used our necks for landing fields until we launched the canoe below  | a beautiful basin , into which cataracts poured from several ravines . In three hours we had worked our way to the foot of an island and were trapped by falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking another passage . DESPERATE PADDLING AVERTS DISASTER Neither of my two companions had ever ridden such wild waters as raged below the island . It was with considerable anxiety that I steered the canoe into the breakers that swept us rapidly toward the brink of a rocky 20-foot drop . In the middle of the river a maelstrom twisted our craft with a suddenness that threw the starboard gunwale beneath the water . The sluggishness of the half-swamped canoe alarmed me . Only the plucky paddling of my comrades saved us from being dashed to the bottom of the falls . We reached a rock island in the nick of time , where two soberf aced pelicans sat watching our performance . Here we camped . Our ravenous appetites overcame discretion and , despite the dietetic warnings of Dan , who passes his winters studying medicine , the last of our provisions went for supper , so that we had nothing left for breakfast . At the Mountain portage we dragged the canoe over a high hill where Mackenzie had counted off 335 paces . Below the Mountain Rapid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rapid of the Drowned . In 1786 five men and two canoes were lost here while on their way to establish Fort Resolution for Peter Pond . Although the last portage , more than 500 paces long , was on the opposite side of the river , we took the wrong side , as usual , and performed a goat act with the canoe along a steeply wooded bank , arriving at Fort Smith 28 hours after leaving Fitzgerald . The Mounted Police had sent a canoe upriver to search for us . EATING , ONE IS EATEN ? BY MOSQUITOES At Fort Smith the Slave River Valley is loo feet deep . Downstream the banks roll into a low alluvial plain , with long , straight stretches and great meanders for 200 miles , to Great Slave Lake .  | A characteristic evening picture down this stretch of river was of the Doctor propped up against a bag inside our tent , reading Marco Polo , and at odd moments blowing fly-killer through a pipe at some mosquito . He said he was revenging the ancient grudge of all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lone land , his descriptions of it were beggared by his praise of his insecticide , " the miracle of science . " Meals were an ordeal , for each bite of bacon was punished by six bites from the mosquitoes . This problem was partly solved by trotting up and down the bank to create a breeze . Whether or not a mosquito is subject to colds , he does not appear to appreciate a draft of any sort . Like the Athabaska , the Slave River has a treacherous delta , and steamers are often obliged to wait for hours on the whims of the weather before they can proceed into the open lake . We fought our course across a windy channel to Moose Deer Island , where , marooned in the warm sunshine , Howells cheered us with soup . I left the expedition here and paddled into heavy swells around the point into Resolution , which lay exposed on a shallow , windy , sandy bay . A half dozen large cabin planes on pontoons were docked here . They are credited with doing more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEATH STALKS THE INDIAN TRIBES The planes were a great curiosity to the Dog Ribs , Yellowknives , and Chipewyans , whose tents and tepees straggled along the beaches . At one time the Yellowknives had been the most powerful Indian nation in this part of North America and had held the most productive fisheries and caribou passes . In 1830 the Dog Ribs rose against them and almost exterminated their tribe , a blow from which they never recovered .  | The Dog Ribs , to-day numbering a thousand souls , seek to isolate themselves and retain their old customs , depending upon wild life for existence . Their loss of former roving characteristics has been accompanied by a certain moral and physical decline ; but disastrous tribal wars are at an end , though ancient enmity with the Eskimo still exists . Throughout the Mackenzie District the death rate exceeds the birth rate among the tribes . At Resolution we bade good-bye to our mine-prospecting friends and their skiff , and because of the hazard of traveling heavily laden along the wind-swept lake shores , the Doctor boarded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in ten days at Providence , at the head of the Mackenzie . I left Resolution at 5 o'clock on the afternoon of July 11 , and in two days headed the canoe up the strong current of the Buffalo River . A young fellow who had proudly informed me at Waterways that he was going to work at a fancy fur farm at Slave Lake was on the bank , disguised in a coating of fish soles , cutting fish . He was almost screened from the sun by mosquitoes . As he helpfully grabbed the prow of the canoe to keep it from swinging back into the swift current , his boss curtly informed him that it was not yet 5 o'clock . From Buffalo River , bucking an offshore wind , I had an exhausting paddle of 15 hours to Hay River . At midnight , when the moon was blurred by a cloud , I made out the fish stages on Fish Point . The fall fishing on Great Slave Lake , when a half million pounds of whitefish and trout are caught , split and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's food supply , is the most important event of the year . COFFEE AND BACON ARE MAGIC WORDS The Hay River bar was moaning , as I escaped into the mouth ahead of a heavy  | blow that swept the lake for five days . I found the village asleep . As I paddled up the river , a great loneliness crept over me and I felt like an Ishmael in the land . Imagine my glad surprise when a jaunty , red-coated " mounty " on the bank shouted offers of coffee and bacon . On July 19 Doctor Rebec arrived at Hay River with the Indian agent from Resolution . The Slave Indians inhabit this . region south of Great Slave Lake and along the Mackenzie to Wrigley . They have always been fishermen and lack the energy and initiative of the Yellowknives and Dog Ribs , who are caribou hunters . The treaty council opened at to o'clock . Grouped about the table with the Indian agent were the mission people , the Mounted Police , the chief , the assistant chief , and their interpreter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes before had set aside the dignity of his office to beg a can of berries from a trader , had now cloaked himself with it again . The interpreter translated the chief 's complaints with a half-bitter vehemence , tossing them at the agent like red-hot rivets . A new law had come into effect , forbidding the Indian to hunt the muskrat with a shotgun , and the chief objected . He contended that his old people could not see well enough to use a rifle on muskrats , for " a muskrat is very small , and it is not like shooting persons . " The agent replied that if he was a very small muskrat , he would not give any of them with poor eyes a chance to shoot at him . The agent then presented a plan by which the Indian would raise his fur like a white man and trap only as a sideline . This did not appeal to the chief . The dauntless spirit of his race seemed to speak in the fierce defiance of his answer . Burdened and degraded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his words was a wild gesture of freedom as he declared that the Indian could not even raise dogs , let alone wild animals . Near the agent , at the head of the table , sat the mission nurse . The chief , on behalf of his people , demanded her dismissal , saying : " When a chief is no longer good for his people he is removed . "  | " But she is not a chief , " the agent answered . " Besides , she is a good nurse . " INDIANS DISLIKE PALEFACE MEDICINE " She may be good for her own people , but she does not suit us , because she grows angry and tries to force her medicine down our throats , " the chief replied . " When a small child gets mad we understand and have patience , but a grown man or woman has no right to behave like a little child . " The nurse 's face turned crimson . I learned that at one treaty meeting an Indian complained that the treaty flour was spoiled ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eaten . Upon examining the pie and the flour , the agent 's verdict was , " The flour is all right , but shoot the cook . " I now joined Doctor Rebec on the decks of the launch , Peter Pond , and for the first and only time took the canoe from the water . We sailed the next morning at sunrise on the 75-mile voyage to Providence . When Mackenzie explored this region he groped for days in fog , amid broken floes , searching for the entrance to the river . His Indians , bailing foiitheir lives with a copper kettle in heavy swells. threatened to kill for his ignorance the guide whom they had forced to accompany them . Our Indian pilot did not meet with threats from us , for we were all very comfortable on the launch . As buffalo flies boarded the launch , the guide said we were nearing the mouth of the Mackenzie . A moose splashed across the shallows at Brabant Island , at the outlet to Great Slave Lake . Riding a seething current , we espied above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission , and the trading posts of Providence . The Slaves here are still the itinerant people of more than a hundred years ago . While the natives to the south build cabins , these Indians are born , live , and die in their native tepees and brush camps . On the morning of Sunday , July 21 , we dropped downstream from Providence with the mission chimes ringing out and came soon after noon to Lake Mills ,  | where smoke from forest fires hung like a haze over the lake islands and points of and . To the north the snow-capped Horn Mountains rose out of a monotonous plain of muskeg and lake , the first mountains seen since our departure from Waterways . We paddled into the river again before a strong easterly breeze and choppy sea . The stream was wide and sluggish for a day and a half , with wild hay meadows and deserted Indian camps on each shore . Doctor Rebec , during his launch voyage on Great Slave Lake , had contracted influenza froth the Indians . The pallor in his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he was very cheerful . THE HEAD-OF-THE-LINE Seventy-eight miles from Simpson we came to what is known as the Head-of-theLine , where the river narrows through a bowlder-clay formation , and the current , filled with hissing eddies and swirls , increases from six to eight miles an hour . Here the lines on motorless craft , which must be towed upstream by men walking along the shore , may be taken aboard and the paddles and oars used . Squalls swept the river , but the banks were high and we escaped them . At twilight we passed the silted Liard River , emptying into the green Mackenzie , and immediately below we paddled into Simpson , the metropolis of the Mackenzie . EVIL DAYS HAVE COME TO THE SLAVES Many of the 250 Slaves at Simpson were coughing and the whole village had the atmosphere of a sanitarium . Sometimes the warm chinooks wander down the Liard , in contrast to the prevalent winds that add a bitterness to the northern winters . The daily average summer 's sunshine is i8 hours , but our log dates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequent and snow flurries occurred . The river mirrored clouds as it bore us toward a magnificent cluster of mountains . It was a serene spectacle . The fish stages and abandoned camps that we saw above Simpson had disappeared , and the river  | seemed to have shaken itself free of everything except its own charm . On his voyage Mackenzie at first mistook the snow patches on these mountains for talc . These mountains were a storm center , for below the North Nahanni River their summits seemed to spout clouds that spread across the heavens and resulted in a gale that blew for two days . We thatched a willow windbreak to protect our silk tent from the driving rain . My throat was sore , and Doctor Rebec , lying on the bleak ground , coughed through the night . The Doctor did not worry . Under the light of the candle , I sewed my oilskins and he read to me . While the wind howled through the stormy night , Macbeth killed Duncan . THOUGH ILL , THE DOCTOR IS GAME The Doctor faithfully observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to awaken me to travel . The wind had gone down . Afflicted with all the melancholy of the northland , I growled in my sleeping bag about conditions in general . Afterward I felt remorse for losing my spirits when the Doctor was ill . At 8 o'clock we embarked in heavy breakers and at sundown were camped under a still , cloudless sky on the beach at Wrigley , in the shadow of Roch-qui-trempe-a-l'eau , the most distinctive landmark in the Mackenzie basin above Norman . The confined river , looking up from Wrigley , with giant mountains in the background , presented wild and sublime scenery . Wrigley was a desolate spot , for it is active only during the winter . A post trader there fed us cookies and coffee at the Hudson 's Bay establishment . We departed from Wrigley at 3 a. m. , with the sun still behind the Franklin Mountains . The burnt forests had been replaced with flowering fireweed that made them gorgeous . Bird songs gave a charm to the solitude.  | The downstream breeze freshened and the canoe , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That night , at the mouth of the Saline , two scrawny and emaciated Indians towed three canoes upstream . In the canoes were five reclining Indians who dozed contentedly while they awaited their shift at the line . Down the Saline Valley a cold wind breathed on our camp , as if coming from a snow field . We sighted Bear Rock from Old Fort Point , where we lost both our sailing breeze and the swift current . It was so warm that I had a job coaxing the Doctor back into the canoe again after lunch . We watched for the lignitic coal seams that Mackenzie reported burning in the bank . THE DOCTOR SAYS GOOD-BYE We camped on the ragged beach at Norman that night . It was our last bivouac together , for Doctor Rebec was compelled to leave me at this point and return to his university work . He began packing his bag to depart upstream by steamboat . I was determined to go on and cross the northern Rockies to Fort Yukon . The Doctor bade me good-bye August 5 , and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine a comrade . Just as the Doctor was boarding the steamboat , however , I had the good f ortune to gain another companion . Hans , a rover by nature and a trapper by vocation , came in from Simpson , riding his large dory and towing two canoes . Refreshing as a breeze astray in the heat of the northern summer , he hitched his boat to a snag and his three dogs to rocks and assumed the air of one fully encamped . After we had agreed to travel to the delta together , Hans , without taking off his cap , curled up in a ragged blanket on the beach and went to sleep . He was a man after my own heart . Hans said the only difference between the rice he ate and that which his dogs ate was that he put raisins in his . He always tried to make the dogs believe he was eating the same grub , lest they complain too much . To celebrate our alliance . I manufactured some pancakes which Hans declared the best he had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that Hans was willing to eat anything , sleep in any place , and complain about nothing .  | The variable winds of spring and summer were settling more and more to the northwest . The gales were sudden , shifty , and annoying , though we were partly sheltered by Bear Rock . WINDS PLAY BOISTEROUS TRICKS Ten minutes before we were ready to leave , on August 7 , the fire was scooped out of its bed , the tent was blown down , and our plates were filled with sand . Hans 's philosophy caught the wind both ways . When it blew downstream we sailed ; when it blew upstream he said it was blowing the white foxes ashore for his winter 's trapping on the delta . The river was wide and wind-swept below Norman and we bumped along shallow shores . We stood shifts in cranking the outboard motor , but were discouraged to find that some of the gas we were using would not ignite with a match . Hans put it aside as an extinguisher , to use in case of fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motor drowned out the melody of the birds , and Hans 's dogs caused me untold misery , shifting about in the canoe . I thought they would capsize it and Hans would lose all his traps ; but we descended the San Sault Rapids , where the river bores its course through a limestone ridge  | 1700 feet high , and at sunset on the third clay were above the Ramparts . From upstream the stony portals of the Ramparts are most impressive , as the whole river is funneled into a narrow canyon with vertical limestone walls 150 feet high and five miles long . They must have alarmed the intrepid Mackenzie , cruising in unknown waters , but not Hans , who started downstream with his dory and two canoes with apparently no concern whatever . Paddling through the Ramparts , we came to Good Hope , i6 miles south of the Arctic Circle . the northern limit of the Hare Indian Nation . At Little Chicago , between Good Hope and Arctic Red River , we met a Tutsieta River trapper who staked his dogs close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hans advised him to teach his dogs to use nets and thus solve his feeding problem . This trapper said that , owing to outside markets , a white man need trap only onethird as much fur as the Indian to make as much money ; for while the Indian uses from 20 to 30 traps , the white man seldom has fewer than 150 . Our trapper 's philosophy was to get the Indian 's money before the traders got it . He told us that he almost made his expenses one winter by keeping his Indian partner 's phonograph in repair for him . I shot the only duck of the voyage below Little Chicago . Dodging squalls , we fought our way to Thunder River , where Bill Clarke runs a trading post . Bill 's idea of a country gone to the dogs is one where there are too many people and not enough dogs to eat his dried fish . Below Thunder River we ran all night , emerging from the mud Ramparts with the motor wheezing its last . We camped on the mud bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an encampment of Loucheux Indians . The Loucheux were puzzled over what tribe weatherbeaten Hans belonged to . They readily classified him as a brown Indian , little suspecting his flaxen-haired Viking ancestry . I slept in my canoe under a canopy on the edge of the bank here . A high wind  | came up , sending breakers against Hans 's boat , and I laughed aloud to see him rowing to shelter up the Arctic Red River at midnight , with his shirt tail flying in the wind . My laugh scarcely had time to echo before the section of the bank on which my canoe was resting broke away , dishing both the canoe and me into the muddy river . Never before had the bleakness and cold of that northern land so impressed me as when the water rose about my waist and I tugged at my canoe to get it and my equipment out of the river . Hans and I had a pancake celebration when I left him at 2 a. m. , August 18 . He had decided the delta was too crowded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The river was covered with a thick fog , but by lo o'clock the fog had lifted and I passed Point Separation , where Sir John Franklin and Doctor Richardson parted in 1826 , Franklin turning to the west and Richardson coasting easterly to Coronation Gulf . To the northward lay the Arctic coast across a hundred miles of low delta islands , the undisputed heritage of the Eskimo . TO BE ALONE WITH NATURE IS JOY This was a big moment for me . There was no life to be seen ? only that life I had come to know in the wind that chilled me and in the sun that gave warmth . In the silence I could hear my watch ticking loud . To the westward loomed the snow-capped Rockies , the barrier my canoe-cramped legs were to conquer in crossing to the waters of the Porcupine . Shortly after noon I arrived at the mouth of the Peel , which shares with the Mackenzie a common delta . I headed upstream 28 miles for McPherson . A few miles above the mouth I stopped at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . A thrill of conquest swept through me the next afternoon as I sailed into McPherson . Formerly , until superseded by Aklavik , it was the end of the run for river boats . It was here that I had decided to forsake my canoe and cross the Rockies , through mountain streams and swampy tundra , to the waters of the Yukon ? a decision so punctured by misgivings that I hurriedly sold my canoe and engaged a Loucheux guide for fear I might change my mind . My right knee had been injured in Japan a few years before and would stand no undue exertion without becoming swollen and painful . Judging from accounts of the hardships of the overland trip , I was already as good as buried . THE PAINFUL TREK BEGINS A whaleboat transported us across the river August 22 , and Abe , my guide , loaded our packs on four dogs . I made my 6opound pack up after a picture from a NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE showing a Korean carrying live pigs to market . The trail ran through a wood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill , where we camped for the night near a small stream . Abraham seemed morose and unfriendly , but he gave me a large caribou steak that the Indians had contributed as postage stamps for some letters I was carrying to Old Crow for them . The next morning , though Abe objected , we ascended a series of rolling hills , where wet willows soon increased the weight of our packs and soaked our clothing . A bitter , sleet-laden wind swept the open ridges , and I was soon encased in a sheet of ice . While Abe lamented and rested , proclaiming " It is bad , " I galloped about , trying to keep the inside temperature of my clothes above freezing . Abraham dragged the dogs , with their packs on , across two swollen mountain streams so deep that their noses stuck out of the water like periscopes , yet he attributed all the water collected during the day to the wet willows . As we approached McDougall Pass a splendid vista of rolling , mossy plains and snowy mountains loomed ahead . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began jabbing me with pains that grew steadily worse . I withdrew most of my sympathy from the struggling dogs and bestowed it on myself . The dogs straggled into camp that night broken-hearted and howling in protest . CALAMITY BEFALLS THE GUIDE With Indian obtuseness , Abraham was not merciful to his dogs . He had almost choked one to death , dragging it along the trail when it was too weak to continue . As the dog lay in the trail , its companions leaped on it with bared fangs to tear it to pieces .  | That night Abraham set aside his primitive aloofness for a little while , when he showed me his new pair of socks with the heels cut out . He explained that his little daughter had cut them out for doll caps . As dusk fell the temperature dropped to freezing . The next morning Abe was in great consternation . He had hung his trousers upon a willow tree during the night and the wind had blown them into the creek . " Maybe they go down to visit my wife at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we crossed the height of land where the waters flow toward the Yukon . We had only tiny willows to burn . The demarcation line between the wooded and treeless areas is very irregular . Isolated clumps flourish in few localities , while exposed dwarfed trees wage a grim battle for existence through these mountains . I was not without fear that I would be trapped in this mountain fastness . Abe was sure of it unless I would consent to have him operate on my knee with his knife " to let out the had blood . " When we overtook an Indian party bound for Lapierre House , camping in a mountain glen , I did not worry any more . I had stretcherbearers in case of an emergency . These Indians were eating caribou meat out of a large pot . They had cooked the head , leaving the teeth in it . I ate this meat with great relish , thankful that the horns were too big to get into the pot . The next day we struck over barren mountains to avoid the swamps in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skimpy lunch on the summit of the Rockies , for when Abe and I looked for our pemmican , we found that our dogs had eaten it . INDIAN CHILDREN THRIVE IN THE WILDS That evening we had descended into McDougall Pass again . The Indian children did not cry about being tired . They rolled down the mountain side for their daily exercise and smeared their faces eating blueberries . John Martin , one of the leaders of the party , told me that the delta towns were bad for the Indians . There his children ate the white man 's food and were always weak and sick ; now they lived in the hills , on the caribou , and were strong again .  | The spent a joyous evening laughing at my camera antics , my jointed oars , my lameness , and Abes ' suggestion that I would make a good husband for Mary , John Martin 's daughter . Everyone laughed at this last but Mary ; she merely looked disgusted . The next morning Abraham started back for McPherson , while Alfred Charlie accompanied me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dogs following me , and I felt proud that these trail veterans should trust in my judgement . They moved up behind Alfred , however , when they discovered their mistake . In the afternoon Alfred shot a mountain sheep , and he very generously presented me with the head , which he knew I could not carry . The day had been warm , and black flies poured out of the soaking tundra in clouds and poisoned my eyes until one close completely . The temperature dropped that night , and next day we broke ice through swamps all the way to where the calm waters of the Bell lay below us . We looked across at the three deserted cabins of Lapierre House . As I drew the tine ten-pound rubber boat that I had packed from McPherson out of the bag to blow it up , Alfred nervously glanced at his watch and said he must be going . After some persuasion he crossed with me , and heaved a great sigh of relief as we gained the bank safely . NOTHING DETERS THE AVIATOR As I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wooded valley , I thought to myself that this was one place , with its lack of landing fields , that would he safe from the northern airplane invasion . I pushed the door of the cabin open and found this note on the table : " Roberts and Fochler , Dominion Explorers , Ltd. , stopped here on way west from Fort McPherson . Left here August 1st by aeroplane . Thanks for the use of the cabin . Am leaving some grub for anyone needing it . " I had to lie over at Lapierre House a day , massaging my knee , before I could bend it enough to sit in the rubber boat .  | Alfred Charlie had me write a letter for him to his brother at Old Crow . His dictation was full of grief . His two daughters , Laura and Martha Jane , had died at McPherson that spring ; Alfred had split his leg with an ax ; all his other children were sick ; John Martin 's boy was drowned at Hay River : William Firth 's wife died last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many young children died at McPherson and Aklavik . Then he added , " But do n't you feel sorry for me . " Fine chap , this Loucheux . Embarking on the Bell , I carried a hatchet in my belt and kept on the side of the river where there were large spruce which could be converted into a raft in case of disaster . A MEAT DIET GROWS MONOTONOUS The next afternoon I rowed the rubber boat into the Porcupine 5o miles below Lapierre House . An ecstasy swept through me on reaching that broad highway that flowed to Fort Yukon , 400 miles away . But almost immediately I set a new goal Old Crow . That victory was already becoming stale to me , as I watched new bends . As I swung into the Porcupine two launches loomed in sight , bound upstream . My heart began to thump wildly as I thought of a possible cracker to relieve the meat diet . " Fourteen days out of McPherson and out of flour . " I shouted in answer to a query . My eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He tossed me a caribou steak . The Indians were shooting caribou at a crossing below the Bell and piling them on willow branches along the shore . They held up steaks in offering , but I was so tired of meat that I kept in the middle of the river and closed my eyes until I was around the bend . Once three caribou swam past the canoe ; then followed me for a mile along the shore . The wind was terrific here . Squalls swept up the river with hurricane fury , roaring through the willows , sounding like the ocean surf . Sometimes I would paddle along a few feet an hour , with West Wind trying to shove me back up the river .  | The voyage became a battle and a game in hugging the lee banks and playing hideand-seek with him on the bends . In places I caught grayling stranded at the mouth of creeks . Above Old Crow I spied some geese honking soisily on a bar . As I had hit only one duck in several hundred rounds of ammunition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the geese . So , raising my rifle , I fired with nonchalance , as if I were merely shooting to hear the explosion . They all flew except one - and he was detained by the bullet . PROSPERITY SMILES ON OLD CROW A high mountain loomed up ahead , as I passed Old Crow River , and at Old Crow Village , the muskrat metropolis of the Porcupine , was welcomed by a dog chorus and Indians on the bank . More than one hundred and eighty thousand dollars ' worth of furs had been shipped out of this village the winter before . The 154 men , women , and children ratting in the Crow Flats took out more than 51,000 muskrat skins alone . The previous season the natives had killed 4600 caribou and 30 moose in this district . The salmon had not been running well for eight years , according to my host , Corporal Thornthwaite , of the Mounted Police . With their business problems set aside for the year , the whole village stood in line and shook hands with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who speak of the dull monotony of semicivilized life in an Indian village . Coming originally from St. Louis to serve as a nurse in the Fort Yukon hospital , she has spent four years with her husband on the Porcupine . Along the banks of the river she has discovered 55 different kinds of flowers . Last summer she had 20 bird nests under observation . She raised chickens , but the cold weather gave them such huge appetites that the eggs produced cost between $5 and $6 a dozen . GOOD-BYE TO CANOE On September 6 I started downstream for the 285-mile voyage to Fort Yukon , as deckhand for Bully Joe , of the Wolverine family ( each Indian family is named after an animal ) . Riding passenger , I lost the thrill of conquest , my feet grew cold , and I was annoyed by gas fumes . To become  | one with the sun and stars and wind , a man must live close to them . Fifty miles below Old Crow we entered the Ramparts of the Porcupine , where towering rock bluffs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushed by us . We stopped at Rampart House , where a dinner of unsalted meat , prunes without any juice , and some jam and tea was served me in a spirit that would have enabled me to eat anything . My host was a white man with an Indian wife . " The old lady and I do n't care much about sweets , " he told me , " but the children take a liking for sweets occasionally , like prunes and dried apples . " Bully Joe rounded up his passengers early next morning , and we cruised through the picturesque Ramparts , across the Yukon boundary into Alaska . Sunset found us in the Yukon flatlands . Thirty miles above the Yukon we landed at a dismal Indian camp to discharge an Indian husband and his bride , Chief Joe 's daughter , from Old Crow . The bridegroom had come from the Chandalar River to marry Chief Joe 's oldest daughter . She took one look at him and refused . It seems her sister was not so particular , and married him . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tank , I steered the launch that pushed a scow down the racing current . He watched me with a growing nervousness as I clipped the ends off several sand bars and swept dangerously close to the spruce sweepers hanging from the banks . Presently he took the helm , saying that I had come far and must be very tired . At noon a broad expanse of water opened up ahead , and we entered the mighty Yukon , sweeping to the westward for Bering Sea . Looking back from the scow . I could see Bully Joe throwing his helm to starboard , as we swung upstream for the whitewashed buildings of Fort Yukon , where ragged arms of chimney smoke curling skyward waved welcome to journey 's end .
