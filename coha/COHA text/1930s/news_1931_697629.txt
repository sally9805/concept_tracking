txt Ownership and operation of all rapid transit lines in the city by a State agency to be known as a Transit Authority is contemplated in legislation now being drafted by Assemblyman Abbott Low Moffat , Republican , of the Fifteenth Assembly District , it was learned yesterday . With the legislation Mr. Moffat is " preparing a tentative plan which would permit the Transit Authority to Issue about $1,350,000,000 of taxexempt bonds in exchange for B. M. T. and Interborough securities and the title to the city 's new independent lines . The members of the Transit Authority , under the Moffat plan , would be appointed by the Governor and the Mayor , each naming an equal number . Assemblyman Moffat has not yet decided definitely to introduce the bill at ? Albany , but he has already discussed the measure and the plan with representatives of the B. M. T. and the Interborough and is now sounding out the views of various business and civic groups interested in a solution of the transit unification problem . In direct contrast to the pending Untermyer bill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title to all rapid transit lines and authorize their operation under the direction of a Board of Transit Control , the Moffat plan would - vest title in a State board which would function along the lines now adopted by the Port Authority . The new plan contemplates an annual issue of about $35,000,000 in city corporate stock to take care of interest and sinking fund charges . Under the Untermyer plan , Board of Transit Control bonds and about $162,000,000 of city corporate stock would be used to finance the proposed $489,804,000 purchase price for the combined B. M. T. and Interborough properties . If Assemblyman Moffat 's survey of the sentiment regarding the pending Untermyer unification bill and plan convinces him that his own measure and tentative plan should be presented to the Legislature , he intends to take the matter up with Republican and Democratic leaders at Albany , B. M. T. Officials Skeptical . Although officials of the B. M. T. and Interborough declined yesterday to comment on the Moffat proposal or to discuss its details , it was learned that the former company regarded it unfavorably , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they felt that its promulgation at this time would only confuse the unification issue and imperil the prospects of getting any sort of legislation through at Albany . The company 's representatives also doubt that its security holders would be willing to exchange their shares and bonds for Transit Authority bonds . Interborough officials , it was said , were also . not disposed to favor the Moffat proposal , although they are nowhere near as optimistic ' about the Untermyer plan as are the B. M. T. spokesmen . City 's Opposition Held Certain . In transit circles it was said that the city 's representatives would bitterly contest any effort to deprive the municipal authorities of any part of their control over the city 's rapid transit situation . Mayor Walker and his transit advisers viewed the Moffat proposal as part of a scheme , which they believed to be developing in Albany among Republican leaders , to bring about the defeat of the Untermyer plan . The same viewpoint is held by officials of the B. M. T. , who are committed , except for a few details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is understood , has found that there is much opposition among civic and business groups to the Untermyer $489,804,000 unification plan and a lesser degree of antagonism to the enabling bill introduced by Senator Downing and Assemblyman Steingut . Ofie of the points raised yesterday against the Moffat proposal was that it would be unconstitutional for the city to issue its own corporate stock to meet interest and sinking fund charges on the proposed $1,350,000,000 issue of Transit Authority bonds . This was so , it was declared , because some of the bonds would be used to acquire private property . Representatives of the traction companies , who raised this point , also declared that another defect in the plan was that it placed private securities only on a par with city investment , so far as the proposed exchange for Transit Authority bonds was concerned . Under the Untermyer plan both the B. M. T. and the Interborough security holders are permitted , to some extent , to retain certain priorities which they now have in relation to city investments . Assemblyman Moffat 's proposal , it was learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pending unification plan and legislation . He re gards the provision in the Untermyer bill , permitting the Mayor to name the majority of directors of a Board of Transit Control , as a means of plunging the entire transit situation into local politics , especially If the bill is permitted to retain the feature which calls for at least one director from each borough .
