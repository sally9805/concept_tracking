BIG DAYS BEGINNING A STORY BY EDWARD HARRIS HETH A L of a sudden the four years were ended and they had graduated , taking their stiff ivory diplomas from the sweaty hand of Mr. Baldwin , Dean of the College of Letters and Science , very soberly as though he were really giving them something important , and so there they were , as President Appleton put it , armed and armored to face a great new world , the world of 1935 . Yes , Appleton said it like that , with a smile like an ecstatic nun 's : " 1935 is a new year , a great year of restoration . I admonish you to go into it as Men and Women endowed with that which the great University of our State has given you .. . . " He licked his lips as though he were tasting again the persimmon he ate every morning for breakfast . They were Men and Women , armored and armed ( " What ? no gas-masks ? " Bingham whispered ) with enviable energy and enlightenment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commencement . Bingham stretched his aching legs far under the booth and drew them back again and then took his pencil from his pocket and wrote on a paper napkin ? " What are you going back home to Montana for , Pearl ? I love you , I really do . Please save this for future reference " ? and shoved it to her across the table littered with coffee cups and ashtrays filled with stubs . " / am Woman  --  thou art a Man , " she said , smiling , but only faintly  --  a tired smile that the pushing heat and long hours of standing in a heavy cap and gown on the green lawn of the Hill had put on her face . She picked up the napkin listlessly , one hand toying with the black coin-purse that lay on the table next her plate , and read it with'the faint smile still on her bright lips . " President Appleton made us that , " she said , not lifting her eyes from his note . " Man and Woman he created us both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He kept looking round him , for perhaps the last time , at the groups of students and the handful of quiet young-looking instructors , some of them sitting with the students , though not so joyful , so noisy , in this end-of-the-year release . When he turned back to her , across the table from him , he saw her wiping her throat , cool and slim , with a crumpled handkerchief . The note he had written was flattened before her , like an opened book . " How could I ever love a girl named Pearl ? " he asked . " Do you ? " she said so softly that he scarcely heard the words above the clatter of dishes and beer steins being clinked for more beer and the harsh clang of the register being rung up . Slowly , as though she were thinking hard of other things , she crunched the napkin in her hand , locking something there , something for her mutely to take back to Montana , and still kept smiling to herself , hotly and lazily , as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then rest there , tight . " Oh , no , " he said . " You 've been a fine lay  --  I beg your pardon , Miss , I meant a fine date , these past few years . Nice to have around college . " " I know . " She nodded , and laughed shortly , looking at him . " I know , " she said again , but she also knew what these past years had been , how they had been close together , scarcely separated , bow deep their love had grown . " Just a toy , " she said , gravely but with a smile bright on her mouth . " Oh dear , what will the girl 's mother say when she gets back to the ranch in Montana ? . . . ' Mother , dear , I 've something to tell you . Here is your daughter back home . Take her to your bosom , mother dear , but remember she is not the same girl she was when you sent her away . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he was , of everything about them , the noisy waitresses insolent yet friendly to the students , the manager buttoning himself in from the heat with knobby fingers and then unbuttoning himself with little sighs . Her eyes grew darker , more sober , as she leaned back in the booth , feeling empty and relaxed now ( with her diploma safe in her room , tossed in her trunk ) with an ache over her slim body from standing all morning under the merciless sun but yet feeling quite happy . She snapped her coin-purse shut for the last time and withdrew her hand , letting it fall lifeless in her lap . She picked up the napkin with the other hand and began creasing it , back and forth . " Gerald ? " He swallowed quickly and looked away . " Would you like a drink ? " he asked . He ran his hand swiftly through his hair . Would n't you like another drink ? Will you please not look at me that way , Pearl my love ? You make me feel sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked , still avoiding her cool pointed face . Without waiting for her answer , he called curtly to one of the waitresses . Now the manager , buttoning his coat over his gasping stomach and unbuttoning it again , came grinning up to them ? " Well , Jerrie , well , Pear11 How you two kids like being graduated ? Oh , they come and go , they come and go , is what I always say ! " ? and strolled away again . " You 'd like another drink , would n't you ? " he said speaking rapidly , as he called again for the waitress . " After all , we only become Man and Woman once . " " Yes , " she said , when at last the waitress , blank-faced , as though she must wall herself in contemptuously from the well-dressed co-eds , her own age all round her , came up to the booth and stood there unsmiling . " Two Martinis , " he said , taking out his big handkerchief from his rear pocket and mopping his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd better have one too , " he said to the waitress . He spoke with the aloof familiarity of having seen her four years , day in , day out , but she regarded him with her blank look of resentment ; from the corner of her stony eye she regarded Pearl , fuming at her coolness and unconcern . " You , I mean , " he said , looking up at the waitress when she made no answer . " You , Emma , have a Martini with us . " " No thanks , " she said , going away . " What I was saying , " he said , following Emma 's retreating hate with a square glance ? " what I was about to say , " he said again , feeling his face grow taut and blanch , turning back to Pearl  --  My God is her name really Pearl ? he thought and burst into heavy laughter . " So what ? " she asked . " Is your name really Pearl ? " " Pearl , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he began , putting both arms on the sticky table and looking without wincing into her face , at its coolness and whiteness and the small point of her chin that invited the cup of his hand . Then he saw it begin to tremble . " Listen , " he said . " Why in hell did these four years go and end , we 've had such a damned swell time it makes me sick to think that  --  Time , that is pleased to lengthen out the day for grieving lovers parted or denied . . . " and then halted . " What I 'm driving at , is , " he began again , " will you marry me , please ? " " Yes . " " Here , " the waitress said , slopping the two Martinis down in little puddles of wet . " You 're sure you wo n't have one , Emma ? " he asked . " No thanks . " " Here 's to you Pearl , my pearl , " he said , lifting his glass from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " " I said once I would . " " When ? " " I do n't know . " " You live in Montana , Pearl . You tend sheep in the mountains . " " You live in New York , darling . You 're a slicker . I know what you want . " But abruptly she shot her hands into her lap and pressed them against her thighs and wrenched her eyes away from his . " You could n't come to Montana , could you , until ? ? " " You might come to New York . " " Ah , the funny man , " she said . " A cigarette ? " he asked , a little coldly . She watched him raise up his body to fumble in his pockets for a pack of cigarettes , and when he drew one out she saw with relief that she could hold her hand out steadily , that his hand holding the match for her was just as steady and the flame did not flicker . So there they were , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Appletonhad promised . They had a whole new world waiting for them ; and that morning in their stuffy caps and gowns they had waited under the beating sun , herded in the scant shade of the maples and elms on the Hill , being told they were ready for life and living and 1935 , and how their four years had prepared them , and how their ivory parchment diplomas proclaimed them Men ( " If he says that once more I 'll be violently sick , " Pearl had murmured ) , groomed them and spruced them in their minds and hearts , all set on their marks , ready  --  for something . They got up to leave the Grill . In the plain dark dress with short sleeves she seemed slimmer and cooler than ever , and he listened carefully to the sound her sandals made as she went over the floor , as though he must remember them forever ; for that afternoon she was going home to Montana . Suddenly he felt weak in his stomach , thinking how she was going to Montana that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job in sight , even though President Appleton had said the whole world was there waiting for them now , a great new world beginning , for Pearl and himself with B.A. 's on their names and four fine years of knowledge behind them . She too , standing beside him while he counted out a handful of change to pay the lunch bill , felt hollow at thinking that she was going away . He counted out a dollar and thirty-five cents from the small handful of coins that was all the money he had left beside his railroad-fare home . " Have you got enough ? " she asked . " Do you want some change ? Here , I 've got ? " " No thanks , I 'm rich as Andy Mellon , " he said , putting the change back in his pocket . Then they began making jokes about how they had graduated into a great new prosperous 1935 , a Iifegiving world that was mar-vellous even though it was a little filled up . And they were prepared for everything ; all they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his pocket and began chuckling to himself , thinking how he had just proposed to her over a sticky lunch booth . They both forgot that they were going in different directions that afternoon . Now he was slipping his arm through hers and feeling the chill touch of her skin . But just as they reached the doorway he saw Miss Purcell come in . " Well , Miss Purcell , " he said , still chuckling . Miss Purcell , in a gray wintry-Iooking tweed suit she had been wearing all year , paused before them , her thin fingers bent lightly over the worn leather purse she carried high under her arm . " Why , hello Gerald , hello Pearl , " she said , for the first time quite naturally not saying Mr. Bingham , Miss Pierce . She spoke with the words flowing from her deeply , hiddenly , with a weary movement of her lips . " Well , congratulations ! " she said . Miss Purcell , their instructor the past year in " The Age of Samuel Johnson , " paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before greeted them curtly on wintry mornings at eight o'clock , then later on the warming mornings of April and May with a strained , slightly irked query : Well , come now  --  you 've had your sleep , tell me what you 've got into your heads about Mrs. Thrale ) and gave them a warm , deep smile that made their faces flush as though she had whispered something low and secret to them . " Welcome to the Work ' ! " she said , softly . " It 's a marvellous place , marvellous . " She turned away , despite the laughter with which they answered her , as though she had been speaking only to herself , and moved down between the rows of booths with a lonely clatter of her heels on the terrazzo floor . They stood in the doorway , stricken by the warmth glowing from her lips and eyes as she smiled at them . They realized how they were no longer students . In saying their names  --  Gerald , Pearl  --  Miss Purcell had become their friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the windows on muggy mornings of late winter rapping her fingers icily on the sill as she asked Mr. Sonnenberg or Miss Ruby Manners what they knew about the poetry of Collins and Gray . They had never thought of her this way before , had never remarked her half-agonized smile before  --  as she welcomed them to the World ! ? so they wanted to speak more with her , to say good-by . " Oh , Miss Purcell ! " Pearl called , in a steady voice . But Miss Purcell was moving away from them down the aisle and they were forgotten . The manager deferentially followed and led her to the exact table he had decided should be hers . They waited , watching her . Reluctantly they went outside . " Ought we go in holding hands ? " asked Pearl , as they went up the broad creaking steps . " Do I ring the bell or what ? " As she waited with her hand on the screen-door she heard the dock of Music Hall striking three in the hot afternoon  --  only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montana if she were taking the bus , but now she was n't , because a half-hour ago , standing in a tavern , a beer glass locked in his hands , he had turned to her abruptly saying , " What in hell do you want to go to Montana for ? What I mean is , when am I ever going to see you again , Pearl ? We 'd better get married right now , you soc ? We 'll get along . What are we waiting for ? Are we men or are we mice ? " " God , I get wonderful ideas ! " he cried . " It 's the way my father and mother did it . . . ' Yessiree , m'boy , on the same day we graduated , in 1910 , your mother and I , I said to your mother , " What say we get married ? " and she said " Fine ! " so we ups and gets married and I took her back to Scarsdale with me that same night , where I picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . . " Ill be damned , Pearl , it 's exactly the way they did it . Listen , what we need now is a witness . " Outside , while they were in the tavern drinking their farewell beers , the day had grown darker and the blistering sun was gone , a sheet of gray over the sky . . . " We ca n't get married now , " Pearl cried , " it 's raining . No one gets married in the rain ! " .. . But by the time he had taken her arm and rushed her outside the shower was already ending , tremendous drops of rain falling soft on the steaming asphalt of the street . " Let 's get Miss Purcell for a witness , " he said . " Miss Purcell ? " she asked , as the brief shower ended , only the awnings and the trees along the curb continuing to drip the cool rain . In front of them was a whole main street washed new and clean , the trolley rails shimmering and the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dome of the State Capitol and behind it the red buildings of the College . " Oh , my darling , look . Yes , " she answered . " Let 's get Miss Purcell . " " You do n't ring , you walk right in . This is a rooming-house , " he said , opening the screen-door for her into the gloomy hallway with its colored window-glass showering dirty prisms on the stairs . Then their anxious fingers ran down the list of seven or eight names typewritten on a tattered sheet of paper flapping with only one thumbtack tohold it to the dirty wall above the hell . Miss Dorothy Purcell , R 1 long , 4 short . . .. " Weil , ring ! " she said , thinking he was never going to touch his finger to the bell and seal something between them , a bond of some kind , for now Miss Purcell had ceased being instructor , had become their important and closest friend , and seeing Miss Dorothy Purcell , R 1 long , 4 short on the torn piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a train after years and years . . . . He rang  --  a mercilessly shrill clamor went through the house , then four shorter cries . " Ring again ! " she said , and scarcely got the words out of her mouth before he was kissing her , hard , but also chuckling to himself all the while , his hand reaching out blindly for the bell to send the piercing clamor of Miss Dorothy Purcell , R I long , 4 short through the house once more , for Miss Purcell was going to be Witness . No more could she rap out to them faceless , without warmth , nervously , " Mr. Bingham , what of Johnson as moralist ? " They were going to be married then and there  --  they had all life ahead of them . As President Appleton put it that morning , they were beginning . " Well , hurry on up . What 're you waiting for ? " a voice bawled from upstairs . A little surprised at the harsh tone but not thinking of it , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the treads . But they halted half-way up , with their hands arrested on the rail , stunned by the sight of an elderly , dowdy woman , with a string-bag in her hand , standing at the top of the landing . " Well , hurry upl " Obediently they followed the noisy cry and went the rest of the way upstairs . But Mrs. Badge , the landlady , with bobbed hair much too short and stringy , had vanished from their sight as startlingly as she had appeared . Yet they went quietly up the stairs , keeping close to each other , rounding the landing ? " Who in the devil 's this old witch , what 's happening ? " Pearl murmured  --  until there she was again , standing before a half-shut door with her empty string-bag , unfilled with the vegetables she had been going to shop for , rolled in a frantic knot in her hands . " Police ? " she asked , squinting in the dull hall light . " We came to see Miss Purcell . " " Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want Miss Purcell for ? You ai n't the police ? " she said , distorting her pudgy face , whipping her string-bag up to her eyes . " Why , I called for the police . I been locked in the bathroom , waiting , oh God , a thousand years , I guess . What do you want Miss Purcell for ? " she asked abruptly , in a sly husky voice . Then she began to whimper . " Say , I been hiding in the bathroom waiting for the police ! Here 's her room if you want ? " Then Bingham saw Pearl 's face begin to tutu white . Later he was surprised how long it took him to understand , how little he was prepared for it . " Why , we saw Miss Purcell just an hour ago , " he said , looking helplessly from Pearl to the landlady . All he could think was how they had just come to know Miss Purcell , recalling her warm quiet smile in the grill , the abrupt turn of her head as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never dreamed of anything like this . They trod quietly past Mrs. Badge into the little sitting-room that belonged to Miss Dorothy Purcell , late of " The Age of Samuel J ohnson " ? for suddenly he began to understand this , as Mrs. Badge timorously followed them with dry choking noises  --  and saw the littered desk , the gloomy wicker chair , the Michelangelo David on the wall ; before them theclosed door to the bedroom , closed but abruptly wide open in their eyes ( She 's in there , My God , you should have seen her but I did n't touch her , you got to wait for the police , why , she was a fine good girl , I never thought .. . the landlady wailed ) and they knew what it looked like , tawdry and sparse , with a dishevelled bed no doubt , a scant pile of blouses in the ghastly imitation-walnut dresser , and hooks . " But only an hour ago ! " Pearl said . Mrs. Badge , growing bolder , eyed them suspiciously . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all he could think to do was fumble for a cigarette in his pocket , glancing mechanically about the room  --  at the bookcases , the desk , the small table with a cheap photograph standing beside a jar of garden flowers . " I ca n't imagine why she 'd do something like this , she was always a good girl , why , I 've had her here with me eight years , when she was in college and then when she got this job teaching , why all she did was study and teach , work all day , she never went out , she did n't earn good I guess , why she must 've been a fine teacher  --  did you know her , you two ? " " She was a friend of ours , " Pearl said . " We came here to ? " and halted , looking helplessly across the room to Bingham . " Why she was a fine good girl , working all day , saving every penny , never done a thing wrong ! " He let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the police ? " he said , hearing the words harsh and confused as he said them . " Have you a match , Pearl ? " he asked . " Here , " she answered gravely , picking up a box from the table beside the painted-over wicker chair . She smiled at him weakly , handing him the matches . " That 's her young man , " Mrs. Badge said , more calmly , pointing to the photograph . " He was a good boy , too . Say did you know him too ? " But her bulbous cheeks still shone with fright and terror . " Thanks , " he said soberly , taking the matches , lighting his cigarette , squinting through the smoke at Miss Purcell 's young man . He kept thinking of the warm curious smile Miss Purcell had cast them , still with the burnt match held in his fingers . " We ought to let her young man know , " Pearl said . " Why , did you know him ? " Mrs. Badge said . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always working hard too , kind of smart-like . I had him here with me four years , him and Miss Purcell ? " " He 's a nice looking man , " Pearl said , picking up the photograph but setting it down again quickly , as though she had touched something not hers , something untouchable . Standing before the window , she was cooler and slimmer than before , in her dark-sleeved plain dress and her pale face . " Oh , that nice young man ! " Mrs. Badge said , and began sobbing again . " They were both fine , she was a good girl . Oh God , I used to help them out sometimes with meals and things when they were both here . They could n't get married you know . He 's back home waiting . No job I guess , but she worked hard night and day , saving every penny , but I guess she did n't earn good ? " " We ought to let him know , " Pearl said again . " Why listen " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way my mother and father did  --  on the day they graduated they ups and got married and that same night went back to Scarsdale where he picked up this newspaper job . ' The telephone , " she said , in a distant voice , hearing the hard hollow sound of the bell as it pierced the dark hallway . " The telephone ? Why , what 's the matter ? Who 's ringing on the telephone ? " Mrs. Badge cried , abruptly indignant , all her fright gone . She suddenly plopped herself down in the wicker chair , her eyes flaring with curt outrage . " What 's that ringing for ? What is all this ? ? Say , I wo n't answer it ! " He carried the burnt match with him to the hallway , held it in one hand while with the other he lifted the receiver . " Hello , this is President Appleton 's secretary ; the police have just notified us of this unfortunate occurrence , of course it will best be attended to with complete quiet , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been ill health . " He kept absently scraping the burnt match up and down the spotted wallpaper in front of his eyes . " President Appleton wishes to express his regrets . . you understand this matter will best be attended to if it is kept hushed ? " " No , it wo n't be kept hushed ! " he cried , rasping into the mouthpiece . " I 'll tell every damned person I can get my hands on ! " ? knowing he would n't tell anyone . Returning to the room , he kept thinking how he had proposed to Pearl over a sticky lunch table that noon , and why they bad come here , to get their new friend , Miss Purcell . When he entered the room the three of them kept looking toward the closed door of the bedroom . " President Appleton regrets he is unable to lunch to-day , " he said , to no one in particular . But say , listen , back in 1910 my mother and father ? He glanced toward the desk , still with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashtray among the litter of papers , the books and a nail file and a stack of bills marked Please ! in bright ink . He began to feel sick with an awakening , half-angry resentment , looking at the desk and then the dingy room , its squalor and ugliness and its air of pinching , of just getting by , and its waiting too , Miss Purcell 's hopeless waiting for the day .. . The doorbell rang . He saw Mrs. Badge , with both chunky hands resting on the wicker chair-aims like the paws of a museum lion , wrench herself forward . " Now what ? " she asked , breathing heavily . " Why , it 's terrible ? what 's this now ? The police ! " She suddenly remembered , and the idea of Police filled her with fright again , mixed with her growing rage that Miss Purcell had done this thing in her respectable house . " I 'll tell ' eml " she cried , passing one hand over her bluish mouth and jumping up . Yes , tell ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Scarsdale ? He dropped his burnt match into the ashtray on the desk , his eyes blankly falling to the opened better beside the tray , his ears distantly hearing the shuffling sound of the arriving policemen , clambering over the grimy prisms on the stairs . The police came into the room while he scarcely noticed them . They got out notebooks and pencils and opened the door of the bedroom blandly . Dear Miss Purcell the letter read ( he saw it dumbly ) because of a limited budget we are extremely sorry to notify you that we will be unable to renew your appointment next fall . . . . " I do n't know a thing about why she done it , naturally not ! " the harsh voice of Mrs. Badge was flashing to the policemen , growing bolder with each word . " I was just going out for some shopping when I heard it . " The police returned to the sitting-room . " Do n't get excited , lady , " they said to Mrs. Badge , and took more notes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone could go . Bingham lifted his eyes and saw Pearl . She still stood before the window , the light dreary behind her , slim and lovely but her face gonewhite , her mouth trembling . She returned his look , gravely , frightenedly , surrounded by the litter of Miss Purcell 's squalor , her scraping , her blind waiting . She smiled at him helplessly . He could not stop looking at her , his eyes held on her solemnly but with horror too , feeling much older than he had ever felt before , suddenly grown . But Pearl , back in 1910 ray mother and father just upped and got married , hurry , we can still . . . " You 've got to take her away , get her out of herel " Mrs. Badge cried to the policemen . " A respectable house ! " " I 've only got twenty minutes to make my bus home , " Pearl said woodenly , looking into Bingham 's eyes . " Good-by , Mrs. Badge . " All he could do was follow her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but this does n't matter he thought , confused , we can still .. and saw her again , suddenly , as she had stood by the window , living in Miss Purcell 's squalid room , scraping , just getting by , opening bills marked Please ! in bright ink . . . . " I never dreamed that Miss Purcell , " she said , softly , but then did not finish what she was going to say , saying instead " Did you ? " and looking at him questioningly . They went down the stairs quietly , touching each other , but he could not think of anything to answer , and only kept looking at her . When they reached the porch , the afternoon was waning with the quickness of June , the air sifting down toward the earth in a cooler veil . Then as they turned up the street they heard the sound of voices , coming through the still air from the faraway green Hill and the Senior Swingout  --  many white-dressed girls swaying down the sward  --  beckoning voices that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a faint halloo through siren 's hands . " There 'll be a cab at the corner , " Pearl said , pretending not to hear the voices . " I 'd better grab a cab or I 'll miss my bus , " she said swiftly . " Why , listen , Pearl  --  we can still ? " he began rapidly , as though to deafen himself to what he had so curiously learned , but then halted , wanting only to take her in his arms , never to let her go away . But then be knew he could not ask her to stay . He felt stunned , knowing suddenly how deep his love for her was , knowing , because of it , how he must let her go , signalling a taxi for her at the corner and helping her into it , though not going with her because he did not want to go to the station , to say good-by ; reaching into his pocket to pull out his last scant change , handing it to the driver to pay her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , before the window , thedim light behind her and at her feet the squalor and grime . They could still hear the faint , inviting voices from the faraway Hill . But now she was putting her hand through the opened window of the cab , saying weakly , " Give my love to your mother and father , " and then saying nothing more , only looking at him as though she knew nowwhat he knew too . " You take good care of those sheep out in Montana , Pearl , " he said . " Oh , I will ! " she laughed feebly , as the taxi started off . " I 'll be seeing you soon ! " he shouted , frantic suddenly , wondering When ? how long ? , watching her go away , thinking of these things which old Appleton had forgotten to tell them , that morning , a thousand years ago , in their caps and gowns under the blistering sun .
