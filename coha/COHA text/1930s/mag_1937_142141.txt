SALVAGE - Roger Vercel - Harper ( $2.50 ) . <P> Since Joseph Conrad no writer has equalled his unforgettable stories of the ' ' glorious and obscure toil " of seamen . Few have tried , and of these William McFee and H. M. Tomlinson , at their best , have been fortunate enough to emerge for brief moments from the vast shadow which Conrad cast over the sea in literature . <P> Emerging bravely from that shadow is the latest novel by Professor Vercel , whose Captain Conan in 1934 received the Prix Goncourt . Written in lean , brilliant prose , Salvage rises to a sustained pitch of excitement in telling of the rescue of a Greek cargo steamer by the salvage tug Cyclone , fades again when the rescue is completed midway in the book . <P> Commanding the Cyclone is tall , grey-eyed , 46-year-old Captain Renaud , famed in every port of the world for spectacular rescues carried out with a specially adapted Russian icebreaker and a hand-picked crew of 30 who stay on 24-hour duty , functioning with the same perfection as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are stony , hare-lipped First Mate Tanguy , who broods over his wife 's infidelities on shore , damns the invention of radio because it enables her to time his return ; and Boatswain Kerlo , a man with a mysterious aristocratic past , who drinks heavily on shore , reformed once and took to reading but was ordered by Captain Renaud to go back to drinking again when he began advising the crew life was not worthwhile . <P> Discernible also are the cook , two radio operators and the chief engineer , the rest of the crew remaining in the background as heroic but anonymous supernumeraries . <P> The rescue goes badly from the first . <P> The hurricane batters the Cyclone 's , superstructure to pieces . When they reach the Greek steamer after twelve hours , its hysterical crew refuse to come on deck to take the towing hawser . Finally coaxed out the next morning they bungle the job and the hawser , worth 50,000 francs , breaks within an hour . When a second hawser breaks , the Greek crew beg frantically to be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sends out wild messages that the Cyclone has sunk . The Cyclone 's , smashed radio transmitter prevents cursing Captain Renaud denying the charge , and while the furious crew of the Cyclone risk their lives to rescue its occupants , including the beautiful French wife of the Greek captain , the towing hawser fouls their propeller . They drift toward a reef , but within a half hour of being pounded to pieces the engineer clears the propeller . <P> Within sight of the harbor the hawser suddenly snaps again , this time cut deliberately by the Greek captain to avoid paying salvage costs .
