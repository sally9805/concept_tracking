txt Practical Spirituality . You have printed the letter of my Princeton classmate , John , commending the President for his advocacy of a religious revival . Non-religious people respect as highly as others " the deep appreciation of the permanent values of life . " In fact , the more religious a person is , the more confident he is that this life is merely in preparation for the hereafter , the less apt is he to be devoted to reforming our political and economic systems . Religion is based upon a revelation completed over 1,500 years ago ; the spirit of progress is born anew every day . The present is the most dependable era of revelation . An analysis of the world as known in our own time will develop the most practical , and therefore the most spiritual , philosophy . WILLIAM FLOYD . New York , Feb. 26 , 1936.
