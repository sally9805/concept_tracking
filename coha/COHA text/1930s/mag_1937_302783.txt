The heat at Buenos Aires sizzled up to 97 last week , and it was hot even at Mar del Plata , Argentina 's swank summer resort 250 miles south across the pampas . At nearby La Sorpresa , the great wooded estancia of one of Argentina 's first families , Sportsman Simon Pereyra Iraola was entertaining his father-in-law , Senator Antonio Santamarina , leader of Argentina 's Democratic party . Rancher Pereyra Iraola had ridden over from his neighboring estancia , San Simon , where he breeds some of the Argentine 's finest horses . The next to youngest of the Pereyra Iraolas ' seven children , 2-year-old Eugenio , was playing on La Sorpresa 's big lawn and had just had his dinner . His mother left Eugenio to his nurse to welcome her husband on his return . The nurse left Eugenio for a moment . When she returned he was gone . The nurse and the Pereyra Iraolas frantically searched the woods at the edge of the park . Then to the gate of La Sorpresa two miles away cracked a grim order from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave . By telephone the whole southern Argentine was then called on its first major kidnap hunt . <P> Within a few hours every peon in the Pereyra Iraolas ' neighborhood was stuttering out answers to police , every estancia gate and fence in rich Buenos Aires province was carefully watched . If Father Pereyra Iraola is no such popular hero as Charles Augustus Lindbergh , Senator Santamarina is nevertheless politically potent , and his brother Enrique , who heads the great Banco de la Nacion , is extremely rich . Also , a great-uncle of the kidnapped child is Carlos M. Noel , president of Argentina 's Chamber of Deputies . <P> At La Sorpresa , the Provincial Chief of Detectives , famed Fernandez Bazan , began to round up suspects . The truck driver , one La Fuente , who had carried Father Pereyra Iraola 's baggage from San Simon and had left just before the kidnapping , was dismissed after claiming that two unknown men had asked him for road directions . Two neighborhood vagrants , a Russian and an Italian , were vainly questioned . Then police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from La Sorpresa the night of the kidnapping , and who aroused further suspicion by failing to explain where he got the new clothes he was wearing or why he had shaved his beard . The kidnapped baby 's 5-year-old brother Miguel told Detective Bazan that a bearded man had streaked out of the trees , whisked Eugenio back with him . But the most important clue of all to Argentina 's press seemed to be that the nation 's Public Enemy No. 1 " Pibe Cabeza " ( Pin Head ) Rogelio Gordillo , had been hanging around La Sorpresa in November and had robbed Father Pereyra Iraola on the road nearby . When Pin Head Gordillo was shot down by police last month , Rancher Pereyra Iraola identified a rosary in Gordillo 's pocket as his . <P> The manhunt tightened around Buenos Aires , where Pin Head Gordillo 's lieutenant , one Antonio Capriolo , was still at large . Every car entering the Federal District was stopped and searched . The newspaper Critica scooped its competitors with a " life size " portrait of Baby Pereyra Iraola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police caught sight of Antonio Capriolo , opened fire over the heads of terrified passersby . After a brief duel Public Enemy Capriolo escaped .
