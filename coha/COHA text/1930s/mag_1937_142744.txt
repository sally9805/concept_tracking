In Mexico City last week , taxi drivers alarmed their passengers by driving in quick spurts , coasting as far as they could before spurting again . This maneuver was supposed to save gasoline , which was not to be obtained at all . Reason : 18,000 members of Mexico 's Syndicate of Petroleum Workers , settling into their second week of strike against Royal Dutch Shell , Standard Oil of New Jersey and 15 other Foreign companies , had shut Mexico 's $500,000,000 oil industry down as tight as a petroleum drum . <P> Impressed by this large-scale demonstration of his power was Secretary-General Vicente Lombardo Toledano of the year-old CTM ( Confederation of Mexican Workers ) , a hot-eyed little industrial unionist who likes to be compared with John L. Lewis . CTM 's Toledano was one big step ahead of CIO 's Lewis in that the employers had voluntarily formed a syndicate to bargain collectively under Mexico 's 1931 Labor Law . Negotiations were stalled when the employers stuck flatly at the Oil Workers ' demands : a 40-hour week instead of 44 , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , old-age pensions of from 75% to 100% of salary , &; 6-day vacations with pay . The employers ' syndicate , dismissing the pensions and vacations as " exaggerated and impossible , " offered successively a $1.20 and then a $1.33 minimum wage , a 40-hour week split into five days instead of the five seven-hour days and one five-hour day the union demanded . These proposals were turned down as promptly as everyone expected , and red- &-black; strike flags continued to fly peaceably over orderly picket lines . Since in Mexico any form of strikebreaking is heinously unconstitutional , no worker was afraid of being displaced . <P> Mexico 's sleepy old CROM ( Regional Confederation of Mexican Labor ) , whose head , Luis Morones , is a good friend of A. F. of L. 's William Green , revived sufficiently to snipe at Leader Toledano as a " Communist . " This has been common Mexican talk ever since his union friends gave Toledano , a dapper intellectual , a trip to Russia to study the Soviet scheme . Leader Toledano returned first-class with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But last week the news that Mexican Trotskyists were agitating to turn his oil strike into a general strike was enough to set him off into a Stalinist rage against " counterrevolutionary tactics . " <P> For a week Government services were being supplied with oil by the Government-owned Petromex , whose employes do not enjoy the legal right to strike . But with about $60,000 a day in oil taxes being nicked from his budget , Labor-loving President Lzaro Crdenas finally persuaded the strikers to go back to work , let a Federal conciliation board hammer out a settlement .
