Poland , to which Pope Pius XI was once a lively , winter-sports-loving Papal Nuncio , is predominantly Roman Catholic ( 71% ) . It is also one of the few remaining nations where it is practically impossible to be married or divorced outside the church . Since the Catholic Church does not grant divorces , a Pole who wishes one must be a member of some other church . Last week it . appeared that , just as U. S. citizens get divorces by becoming temporary residents of Nevada , so Poles were getting them by becoming temporary members of the Orthodox Church . <P> Few years ago Poland 's Reno was a small Calvinist church in Wilno . So brisk was its business that several bishops were tried and fined for bootlegging divorces . The traffic passed to the Orthodox Church , proceeded scandalously . The usual method of getting a divorce was to pay some clergyman 500 zlotys ( $90 ) . In Warsaw alone 1,200 divorces were granted during the past two years . <P> Last week the District Attorney of Warsaw confiscated 1,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indictments not only against five Orthodox bishops but also against the highest prelate in the church , heavy-bearded Archbishop Djonizy ( Dionitius ) Waledynski . " Your Grace , " cried the District Attorney , " I accuse you of abusing your legal powers ! " For such abuse the Archbishop faced a possible sentence of five years in prison .
