There was one fellow there , sitting alone and saying nothing but listening all the while . When the argument finally broke up he took me aside and asked me if I was interested in going to Spain . I said I certainly was . It turned out he was representing a group of people who were interested in the fate of democracy in Spain . I just grabbed at the idea . At last I had a chance to go . But do n't think I was just looking for adventure and a chance to see the world . I faced the facts very coldly . I figured out there was terrible disorganization on the government side ; most of the army had deserted them ; Franco was pushing northward from Seville , capturing new towns every day ; and he had crack Italian pilots flying Fiats , modern planes built for war . From all you could learn in the papers , the Republicans did n't have any planes or pilots worth a damn . With my lack of military experience I figured I 'd probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of September . I reached Madrid September 24th , and was taken at once to the air ministry . Some of the other Americans who came over that fall turned out pretty bad . The less said about them the better . I wo n't mention any names , much as they deserve it . One of them beat it with more than seven thousand pesetas he had taken from his outfit and from Spanish friends . Another turned yellow . When it was time for him to go to the front he got sick . Then he asked for leave to go to Valencia to meet his wife , so he said . Of course we never saw him again . The other American of our group was too old for combat flying , and he 's still active as a chief navigator behind the lines . I 'm the only other one left out of the group I came in with . Some of these fellows and those who came later for big money contracts were so bad they gave all Americans a black eye for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a lot of easy money . And do n't think I 'm a Red either . I never belonged to anypolitical party . I suppose you can call me a liberal . Anyway it fits . II Well , we got to Madrid . It was about eight days before we could fly , so we spent the time investigating Madrid . On the ninth day they tested us out on the Breguet bombers . Those Breguets ? fifteen to eighteen years old ? only had a speed of 140 to 160 kilometers an hour ? not much over 70 miles an hour . They were heavy and cumbersome to maneuver , and so slow it was a crime . At that time , when we first took to the air , Franco 's rebels were marching on Toledo and they were only twenty miles away . There was no way of stopping them . We did n't have any army . We only had a mob of undisciplined volunteers who hardly knew one end of a rifle from the other . They were rushed up to the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes , some with old outmoded guns and some without any at all . It was no victory for the Fascists . Those poor Spaniards were simply slaughtered . It was our job to give them all the support we could : to go out and bomb the roads where the rebels were advancing and try to hold them up . We soon found out we were likely to get it both ways . Our men had had no experience and they could n't tell our planes from the Fascists ' . They shot at us as we flew over on the way to tackle the rebels . At first we were more afraid of our own troops than of Franco 's . It was like that for a good while . Too long to suit us . The first flight we made was with six Breguets loaded with bombs . It was out beyond Toledo . We were supposed to raid a concentration of rebel troops and artillery . In those days the Fascists marched en masse along the roads and we bombed the roads and bridges . Ben Leider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frenchmen , an Englishman , and a Czech . At that time , the beginning of October , the government only had a handful of trained Spanish pilots and most of them were used in posts of command or for administrative purposes . The government had decided they would n't put the administration of the air force in the hands of foreigners . On this raid we had a five-year-old Boeing fighter on which they could never synchronize the guns . It always came back with its own propellers shot full of holes . Lacalle ? you 've heard of him , he 's the greatest ace the Spaniards have turned out and bet he could make a Richthofen or a Nungesser look sick ! Well , Lacall ? flew the rattletrap old Boeing and we also had three Nieuports . They 're supposed to be biplanes , but they have a third kind of a wing between the wheels . They were heavy and slow . After five minutes in the air the windowshields were covered with oil and you could n't see a thing . They were built just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I saw a few World-War de Havilands , like those the British used to fly . In America they 'd be in a museum , but last October we 'd have taken planes out of the Smithsonian Institute if we could have got them . All that the Spanish government had then was a flock of WorldWar crates . Nothing else . This was my first raid . We got over and dropped our bombs , but we 'd no sooner unloaded them than we were attacked by about fifteen Fiats . All we had to protect us in our slow-motion old Breguet bombers was a squadron of six pursuit planes , the World-War crates I 've been describing to you . Lacalle in the Boeing , one Spad , one Dewoutine , and the three Nieuports . Lacalle 's squadron was at about 3,000 meters , and we were about 800 meters when the rebel squadron pounced on us . One group of six Fiats hopped our Breguet bombers ; the rest went after Lacalle 's fighters up above . Of course the Fiats were flown by veteran Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the end of July or the beginning of August ; more of them every week . And a nice picnic they'dhad of it . Well , they had planes twice as fast as ours were and they had it all their own way in this fight too . In our heavy antique bombers the only thing for us to do was to hedge-hop for home as fast as we could . We could only do 160 kilometers an hour at top speed , while their shiny new Fiats made 350 kilometers on a level keel . Just about three times as fast as our Breguets , that 's all . When you 're up against that kind of a handicap , and your life 's staked on it , believe me you fly as you never flew before . You skim the trees , so the enemy wo n't dare to dive at full speed . It simply depends upon how good shots they are in those Fiats roaring past over your head . By hedge-hopping in tight formation the enemy ca n't get underneath you , and you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own machine-gunners in your ships can lay a curtain of fire across the top . So our only vulnerable spot really was from the front and on the sides . You see , the Breguets had no forward guns and only a halfswing on each side . That 's where they had us , given the fact that we had the speed of an air-turtle . And they knew it , all right . We lost two of our six Breguets and the three Nieuports in twenty mad , dizzy minutes . Lacalle and Captain Dane , a first-class French pilot , fought hard at terrific odds and they brought down three Fiats . If we 'd had ships on anything like even terms we 'd have ripped hell out of them ; As it was we lost five to their three . It was n't bad piloting . We simply did n't have the planes . That was the first time we got those explosive bullets that all the Fascist planes have been using ever since . When we got back my plane had holes in the fuselage as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explosive bullets ? and on the opposite side there were scores of small holes from the exploded shrapnel . You can imagine what they do to a man when they hit him . But neither my machine gunner nor I got hit . From reading novels I used to wonder how you feel under fire in an air battle . I thought a man must be brave and heroic . But actually in a gun-fight you 're so busy trying to bring the enemy down and trying to out-maneuver him that you 've got no time to think about anything else ? no time to be afraid . Maybe you 're scared just before it begins , but when a pursuit plane dives at you with its machinegun wide open , there 's only one thing to do and that 's to spoil his target for him and fight back with all you 've got . After that we made two more attempts at raids from Gctafe . But we never reached our objectives because we were attacked before we got there . Also we were deserted by our own pursuit planes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? most of them ? by the mercenary fliers ? men who were flying for fifty thousand francs a month and were a bunch of racketeers and no more . On November 1 , 1936 , when General Franco was hammering at the gates of Madrid , we had n't had a single modern ship of any kind from France or Russia or anywhere else . We were sent back to Murcia to wait for new airplanes that were supposed to be coming in , and meanwhile were assigned to patrol the Mediterranean coast from Cartagena to Alicante with our old Breguet museum piece , scouting out ships and reporting what flag they were flying and what direction they were taking . But along toward the end of November we got word that some new airplanes had arrived at last . Only four months after Franco first got his from Italy and Germany ; but still they had arrived and were being assembled . We were going to have some real ships to fly and fight with at last . They were biplanes , the " Chatos " which have since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on account of their snub-nosed fronts . The Chato is a fairly recent Boeing model . I think it was put out three or four years ago . Of course we only got a small number at first . But they gave us a new lease on life . It was like being mustered out of a suicide squad . What could n't we do with these new beauties ? That 's allwe talked about or thought about from the day we got the news . Meanwhile the Spanish government had started an aviation training school about October 1st . They were training young Spaniards with Breguets and Moths . The students were young soldiers who had been in the infantry and had been recommended for their bravery , intelligence , and promise . In two months or less these boys were sent off to the front with only forty hours of flying to their credit . If you 're not a flier that may not mean much to you , but it 's a terribly tough assignment , you can take it from me . I was assigned to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombing and machine-gunners ' school . I flew the same old Breguets and sometimes an old Vickers torpedo bomber . Then there was an antiquated high-wing monoplane job . When you flew it you felt as if you were under an umbrella and never knew when it might fold up . It was really no good whatever . I never found out what the atrocity was called . I stayed there in the bombers ' school until the tenth of January . Then I was sent up to Toledo province to break in on our new groundstrafers , and were they beauties ! They were good for 260 kilometers an hour and they carried sufficient fuel for seven hours of cruising , where formerly we could only get four hours of cruising out of the Breguet suicide crates . Now we could carry a full load of twenty-four bombs ( 300 kilograms of bombs ) , a pilot , a machine-gunner and our four machine-guns at the front . It was in one of these ground-strafers , as pilot , that I made my first service flight on the central front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we took out those ground-strafers we had our first fight on equal terms with the rebels and we gave them a thrashing that they remembered for a long time . The rebels were making their drive on the Jarama front . We took off , a squadron of fifteen ground-strafers , protected by twenty-five fighters , all new Chatos . We flew at an altitude of 1,000 feet . Our objective was to bomb the troop concentrations and strafe the trenches in front of Jarama . Just before we reached the trench-line objective we tightened up our formation in groups of threes , and each group increased its distance . When we were about 3,000 meters from our objective , we dived down with motors wide open . We swept in at a forty-degree angle and opened up our guns on the trenches . Each plane had four machineguns and we were firing from 1,800 to 2,000 bullets a minute from each gun . It 's terrible punishment ; the kind our men had been taking for two months without a chance at a comeback in the same coin . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dive to an altitude of 400 meters above the trenches . With three planes and twelve machine-guns unleashed simultaneously , that stream of fire is hell . Then when we were directly over the trenches we 'd let loose our load of bombs ? seventy-two bombs from a group of three planes . No human being can really stand it . We saw the rebel soldiers break and run . The poor devils could n't take their own medicine . They quit their machine-gun posts and ran for cover , wildly , like frightened rahhits , in every direction . Each of our planes dropped its twenty-four bombs . It was simply hell on earth ? just a hailstorm of bullets and then a thunderstorm of bombs . That 's what ruined the Italians over at Guadalajara a month later . They had never had anything like that ? and they simply could n't stand it . There , at Jarama , we stopped the Fascist advance in its tracks . They were compelled to stop and dig themselves in . It was the only protection they had from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . On the first day we panicked the rebels all along the line . We made three service flights that day , the last at three in the afternoon . On that one we were attacked by between thirty and forty Italian planes . We were fifteen ground-strafers and we were protected by only fifteen Chato pursuit planes , so they had us outnumbered and they thought they were going to rip us to pieces . Our fighters , in three groups of fives , were from 1,000 to 3,000 meters above us . We had done our strafing and bombing . We were flying at only 500 meters and were about to return home . The Fascist planes set on us . Part of them swooped down on us ground-strafers and the rest went for the Chatos up above . They could n't attack us from below or on the tail because we were flying too low . They did n't know our new type of ship , so they made the fatal error of attacking us from in front ? about fifteen of them . Then the fireworks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our machine-guns cut loose from the nose of our ships everything we had . In the first assault six rebel airplanes went down , crashing on their own lines . Meanwhile other Italian machines were falling down from up above . The Chatos were wiping them up . Most of them fell completely out of control . In that one dog fight we brought down nine Fiats and did n't lose a plane . It was the first time in the war that we had knocked the Fascists dean out of the skies south of Madrid . I do n't know whether I brought down any of the rebel planes or not . You ca n't tell because you are flying in tight formation of threes , and you all have a heavy curtain of fire on the attacking group . It 's impossible to know whose fire actually gets the plane . That 's the difference between the World War air-fights and those to-day . From 1914 to 1918 it was mostly individual combat . But modern aerial warfare is all group combat . The whole tactic is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy plane or the enemy group , firing one on each side , and the third plane guards the tails of the two other planes . That 's why there are so few stories about air-combat aces in the Spanish war . No one pilot can claim credit for bringing down an enemy plane with any surety . It 's group cian4t , that 's all . That night we got back without losing a single plane . We were in pretty high spirits , I 'll admit . But frankly , we usually do n't feel any different when we get back than when we take-off . We always make plans of what we 'll do that night . When we were going to the movies we bought our movie tickets and carried them with us , so we 'd be sure to lose no time if we had a late flight . We always expected to get back for the show . Our aerodromes were 100 kilometers or more back of the lines . Distance does n't mean a thing . We 've bombed the rebel barracks at Zaragoza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's perfectly simple . Franco keeps his heavy bombers as far back as possible from the front ? over by the Portuguese border . They do that so as to force a long and dangerous flight home on any raiding squadron . Our Chato fighters simply raised hell with the Fiats . The Italian pilots fought hard , but our men outsped them and outmaneuvered them . We got eleven enemy planes and we lost none . We did have two machine-gunners killed and three of our planes made forced landings behind our lines . Still there was the score ? Republicans , 11 planes : Francoists , 0 . From that time on the Fascists evidently got specific orders to be prudent . They never tried again to attack us from in front or below . They had learned their lesson . Iv We turned the air-tide at Jarama at the end of January and the first days of February . After that things were quiet for some time . There were no real fireworks until the big rebel push to break through at Guadalajara and smash on into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they threw in four divisions of fresh Italian troops , between thirty and forty thousand of them . Guadalajara was the first example of real co-operation between our Republican infantry and aviation . It was mostly due to our air force that the Italians were routed . We call it the second Capot etto . We made more nights per day than we 'd ever made before . We maintained constant aerial attacks in all kinds of weather , and at times the weather was fearful . But we had to do it to save Madrid from the menace of that drive , and we tore that rolling , mechanized offensive into ribbons . It was the most terrific spectacle I 've ever seen . Nothing that Hollywood ever turned out in mob scenes could touch it for action and horror . We were flying in squadrons of fifteen planes , one after the other . They were sent over in waves and as soon as one squadron finished its job , another arrived to pick it up right where the other left off . I think there must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . That 's what actually held up the Italians ' advance and gave our troops time to counterattack and dig in . But you would have to have been in it to imagine what it was like . Here were nearly forty thousand Italians who had broken through our lines where we were least prepared . They were perfectly motorized ; tanks and great motor lorries filled with troops . They came roaring along that macadamized road . They had a tremendous advantage in numbers and had caught our infantry off its guard . You looked down on that dark , endless column from the air and it seemed as if they 'd keep going from sheer physical weight . A whole army on wheels , blasting its way and moving as fast as the tanks in front could clear the route . Our orders were to stop the leaders , blast them off the road . We came over , squadrons of fifteen in close formation . We dumped every bomb we had on the tanks in front and the road ? tons of high explosives . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about where they 'd hit . In two minutes ' time the tanks and the road were a shambles . The tanks were blown up , overturned , piled up in knots . Then we strafed the troops in the motor lorries ? and all the time our infantry was closing in and charging . It was a co-ordinated ground and air attack , the most perfectly executed maneuver we had ever pulled on such a big scale . Most of the Italian troops had never been in a real battle before . Or if they 'd been in Ethiopia they 'd got a false idea of what war is like . Anyway it was more than they could stand ? and it was worse because their officers had told them they were going to ride right into Madrid , just as they had into Addis Ababa . I saw them jump from their tanks , leap by the hundreds from the motor trucks , and run as only men can run who are possessed by the overwhelming fear of death . They were little dark shapes , twisting , turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelter somewhere from that rain of death . The road was completely clogged by now . The motor trucks extended back for several miles ? I do n't know how many . The trucks could n't go back ; they could n't turn around . Their drivers had deserted them . It was every man for himself . The fields were full of running soldiers . Our infantry had opened up a terrific fire and other squadrons of our planes were dropping 300-kilogram bombs on the Italian supply trains far back near the rear of their columns . The explosions must have been deafening on the ground . We could even hear plenty of them above the roar of our motors . By this time thousands upon thousands of Italians were racing for safety . They were so panicstricken that many of them ran headlong toward our own advancing troops . The Fascists had thrown away their rifles , their knapsacks , everything . Escape was their only thought . Before that day 's attack was done there must have been thirty thousand Italians scattered in mad flight all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our last flight they were still running for cover and long lines of empty trucks and heavily loaded ammunition trainsstood deserted on the highway that was supposed to take them to Madrid . It was a hell of a mess down there all day long . We just kept letting them have it . I know it 's terrible . You do n't have to tell rue ! But who started this war anyhow ? V When did I get this bad leg ? It was during our first offensive on the Guadarrama front . It started on May 31st at three o'clock in the morning . We were trying to take Segovia . Those of us in the Loyalist air squadrons were flying all day long , making five flights a day . That 's a devil of a lot of fighting , in case you 've never tried it . The first two days went off well . On the third day , June second , the enemy was getting tougher . We thought we were through for the day when we got an order to take off immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just as we got off the ground a heavy thunderstorm broke and it looked pretty bad . The clouds were black and thick . When we got nearer the front the ceiling was very low , so we had to go up through the clouds in order to cross the Guadarrama mountains . We had four ground-strafers ? I was flying one of them , as usual ? and we had twenty-five pursuit planes on the flight . The trouble was that fifteen of them were flown by new pilots who were sent out with us to learn their bearings . They were instructed not to engage in any dog fight . Well , they did n't engage . They just flew right into the mess and had to fight their way out with the rest of us . The four of us in the tri-motored bombers had orders to wipe out an artillery concentration at La Revenga ? our last job for the day . After we crossed the Guadarramas we flew through a break in the clouds and we saw La Revenga ahead of us . At the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were busy as a flock of buzzards , bombing and strafing our troops . The Fascists were just as surprised as we were . By that time it was 8:15 in the evening . On account of the storm and the late hour we did n't expect to find any enemy planes in the air and they must have thought the same about us . We popped out of the clouds and found ourselves right in the midst of them . It was a mad jumble . Before we knew it we were mixed up with the rebel fighters , but we had no idea there were so many of them . We only saw about fifteen planes at first and seven or eight of our pursuit ships took them on . We ground-strafers were flying at a dangerously high altitude , about 1,800 meters , and we paid for it later . As the four of us broke through we saw the fight start . We thought our Chatos could more than take care of the rebel ships in sight , but we did n't know we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea there were about fifty rebel planes in the air , most of them hidden in the clouds . So we four ground-strafers decided to go through with it . Unless it 's plain suicide or the odds are overwhelming , we always go through to our objective . We opened up , full speed , straight for La Revenga and let loose our bombs . As we let them go the Fascists jumped on us . The plane next to mine started burning , but the pilot put the fire out . We had great luck with the bombing . We knew we had no time to spread them around , so each of us let go with the whole load ? twenty-four bombs ? at once . It was a wild stab . And we planted the lot of them on the artillery concentration ; wiped it out . Bum 's luck , that 's all it was . Our machine-gunners were firing all the time , trying to hold off the rebel pursuit planes . We were in a tight spot . So we made a guess at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything we had and turned for home . We banked to turn back , and as we did so the Fascist fighters came up at us from underneath . That 's one of the most vulnerable angles for big bombers like ours . We were wide open for it . The bad weather had kept us much too far off theground and the surprise encounter had n't given us a chance to go in low for the bombing . The rebels cut loose at us with everything they had . I heard explosive bullets ripping through my wings . Then I felt the aileron controls snap off , and I knew I was in for a tough time . I lost speed on the left bank turn . The other three ground-strafers had n't been hit in any vital spot and they were leaving me behind . That meant that the Fiats would give me the works if they could . I held the motors wide open and started zigzagging like a fool . I thought if I zigzagged hard enough maybe I 'd spoil the aim of the attacking planes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes I made out pretty well . One after another the rebel fighters came at me . I do n't know how many there were , but they kept coming from both sides and underneath . I 'd lost seventy-five kilometers a mile in speed already . Down below the infantry battle had stopped . An air fight is a show , you know . I was zigzagging and diving at an angle , trying to spoil the rebels ' aim ? and they were really rotten shots . But owing to the broken aileron controls , I could n't maneuver very much . Then there came a whistling past my ears , all of a sudden ? and my whole control board was gone . I did n't have time to know whether I 'd been hit or not . At a time like that you might not feel an arm or leg wound at all . Flames burst out in the front of the cabin , and the gas tanks were at my feet and over my head . In a flash the entire front of the ship was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and I began pulling to open up the straps which tied me to my seat . The pilot is supposed to be the captain of the ship , you know . Passengers out first ! The plane was n't out of control yet , but the two cabins were burning on both sides . I knew I had to jump through the flames . That 's the first time I felt as I know a chicken feels when it is roasted alive . I was tugging like mad at the straps , but I remember I was debating in my mind , should I shut the motors off or leave them wide open ? I hated the thought of losing one of our groundstrafers in enemy territory . I decided to leave the motors wide open on the chance that the ship might come down behind our lines . All the while I was hunting for the release lock to the straps . The smoke blinded me . I was getting fainter and fainter . I do n't know what happened next . I must have lost consciousness , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next thing I remember I opened my eyes and I thought how wonderfully cool it was . I was tumbling down . As I turned over I saw the ship flying like a flaming rocket . It was going straight ahead on an even keel . I was whirling down . Things were tumbling around me . Everything looked cockeyed . Then I realized where I was and pulled the ripcord on my parachute . It was an Irving seat pack . I 'd always had the greatest confidence in that ' chute . I looked down and saw the ground coming up and coming up and the ' chute had n't opened . I thought , " Maybe the ' chute wo n't open . " I kept falling and the ground kept coming up and still the ' chute did n't open . Then I asked myself , " I wonder how it will feel to die ? Will you feel any pain ? " Then I thought , " There 'll be such a terrific shock you wo n't feel anything . It 'll be all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I must have fallen about a thousand meters and I thought " It 's a good thing you had about 1,600 meters to start with . " By that time I 'd decided I would n't feel anything when I struck the ground ; I 'd simply be killed . Then I got mad . I thought , " You 've flown all kinds of old crates and never got hurt . You 've been shot at in dozens of dog fights and never got hit . You 've just escaped the bullets from three or four rebel planes ? and now you 're going to die because this damned parachute wo n't open . " I never got so mad in my life . It was crazy , but I threw the ripcord away . I grabbed at the ' chute on the seatof my pants and tore at it like a fool . I ripped it away from me ? so hard that I tore the nails off of three of my fingers , only I did n't feel it then . Then the ' chute opened up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with a terrific jolt that almost knocked the wind out of me . The ' chute had worked . What happened was this . There are rubber bands on the seat pack and when you pull the ripcord the rubber bands are supposed to release the lock . But the flames had burned the rubber off , so the ripcord did n't work . When I tried to tear the ' chute off I tore open the lock instead . But wait ! You have n't heard anything yet . I started looking around and I began to feel parts of my body burning . It was a lucky thing I was wearing a leather suit . Otherwise I 'd have burned up before I hit the ground . My face and neck and wrists and ankles had been the only parts exposed . They were all badly burned , but my pilot 's headgear and glasses had saved my eyes and the upper part of my head . I saw that my leather suit was burning slowly . The long fall and the rush of air had fanned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , on my legs and body . Then I began looking around to get my bearings . I found that the wind was blowing me toward our lines . I felt pretty good about that . I figured I had just about enough altitude to be able to make our lines . So I went on beating out the embers I still found in the burnt spots in my leather suit . I thought everything was going fine again . Then suddenly something whizzed by me ? the old familiar sound of machine-gun bullets . In a split-second a Fiat zoomed past and I knew he 'd come back . My heart went back in my mouth . I wished the ground would come up like a racehorse . I knew I had to do something awfully fast . So I started swinging the ' chute from side to side , pulling one side and then the other . That way I 'd be a moving target . With luck I might escape getting hit . Then I pulled the cords to make me drop faster . It worked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed all the time . But the Fiat was coming back . It slashed by me from below and flying at an angle . The machine-gun was wide open . I guess the angle was what saved me . The bullets whizzed by and did n't hit me , but I began to see bits of blue sky through the envelope of the ' chute and I knew what that meant . Now I 'm swinging for all I 'm worth and the ground is coming up damned fast . I 'm sure there 'll be a third attack . Sure enough , I see a monoplane coming up and I think , " This time you 're done . " It looks like a Heinkel at first and I 'm swinging back and forth , waiting for the bullets . I know what it 's like to feel like a target . Then I see it 's one of our monoplane fighters come to rescue me . I do n't see the Fiats after that . Long afterward I found out we had lost three planes , two of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine enemy machines . But that 's not part of this story . The ground was coming up terribly fast now . I had no time to watch . Between my swinging back and forth and the bullet holes in the top of the ' chute , I was falling ? not floating down . I said to myself , " You 're going to get a hell of a bump . " Then I saw I was headed for a forest . I figured I must manage somehow to fall between the trees . The trees were coming up at me like an express train . I saw the tops of two trees and a space between . Then I gave myself a swing toward that little hole where the ground was . The ' chute tore down through the branches and stopped with a jerk . I heard the canvas tearing as I went down . Then I was yanked to a stop . The branches had broken my fall . That 's what saved me . But I was still hanging about twenty-five feet from the ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Well , you did n't get killed after all . " Then I asked myself how I was going to get down ? and just as I thought that , the ' chute tore loose . Down I went . I hit the ground hard , on both legs , and the right one snapped under me . VI I did n't feel any pain . All I felt was a snap in the leg . I was lying on my back with the breath half out of me . Then I heard the machine-guns and artillery going again . That reminded me that maybe I was still inside the rebels ' lines . I tried to sit up and I saw my leg stuck out like it was half-twisted off my body . I thought , " How can I get to our lines ? I ca n't go very far . " I looked around and saw a big rock by a tree . I crawled there on my hands and one knee , dragging the leg behind me , Pains began to shoot through my leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . I lay behind the rocks , wondering if I was inside the enemy lines . I decided I must be , so I took out my revolver . If anybody came I decided I 'd shoot as long as my bullets lasted . I must have lain there for about three minutes . Suddenly I heard yelling , like a pack of wild Indians . A bunch of soldiers were rushing down the hill toward me . They jumped from one tree trunk to another and began shooting . The bullets began smashing all around me . I thought , " You 're done for this time . " Then I got ready to fight it out and just as I was going to shoot I saw a red star on the cap of one of the men . I thought I must be crazy , but I looked again and I saw another red star . Then I knew it was our own troops . They thought I was a Fascist pilot and they were shooting at me . If I shot back I knew I 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trunks , and I put my revolver back in the holster . I thought if I did n't return the fire they 'd stop shooting and they did . But that did n't help much . When they had me surrounded a dozen or more of them came rushing at me . I tried to call out that I was a Loyalist , but they did n't hear me and the uniforms are too much alike . They pounced on me shouting " Fascist dog ! Fascist dog . " They dragged me out , one pulling at my broken leg . They kicked and beat me . I was trying to yell in Spanish , but they did n't let up until an officer came . By that time , they 'd hurt me worse than the burns or the broken leg . The officer asked for my papers . Then the men all acted as ashamed as a bunch of kids . They could see I was badly hurt . After that they could n't do enough for me . They carried me half a mile , loaded me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kilometers ? over some of the roughest mountain roads in the world ? to a mountain clubhouse that had been converted into an emergency hospital . The building was crowded . It could only hold one hundred men and the medical staff was very small . The doctors and nurses had n't slept for four nights and they had no electric lights . So they turned the headlights of an automobile on the so-called operating tables and put me to sleep with injections . When I woke up a few hours later my leg was in a plaster cast . It was burning something terrific . I could n't open my eyes and I never had such pain in my life . Since then I 've been transferred from hospital to hospital , and I 've had several operations . The doctors here say my leg will only be about one centimeter shorter than the other , and that means I 'll be able to fly again . The only trouble is it 's an awful long time to wait , and there 's not much you can do . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't many books or magazines in English to read . I get darned homesick sometimes . But I came over here to do a job . I 'm going to finish that first if the war 's still on when I get rid of these crutches . The only thing I worry about is my mother and sisters and kid brother . They live on East Second Street . If you see them when you get back tell them I 'm all right , will you ?
