CELLBRANTS ' Nom : St. John 's African Methodist Episcopal Church at 128th Street has a fine new sign on its side advertising Great Western champagne , suitable , we suppose , for Twelfth Night . ' THERE seems to be a possibility Riker 's Island will smoke out the World 's Fair  --  not a very strong possibility , to be sure , but none the less a straw worth clinging to . There is also a chance that the rats will swim across and chew up the exhibits . It is just like New York to invite the world to a big party , and then set up the tables next to the finest garbage dump in town . The old , old fires of Riker 's Island go deep  --  deep as the old , old desires of people to come to a fair in search of a pretty blue ribbon to tie up their bonnie brown hair . It will be a grand race  --  fire against man , rodent against primate . May the best critter win ! , ci vv writes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fair ) , " can a stranger in New York make himself look like a stranger , so that other strangers wo n't stop him on the street and ask a lot of questions about New York he ca n't answer ? " That 's an unusual question , and we doubt that it is an honest one Actually , strangers ache to give the ap-pearance of natives . The average New Yorker can spot a stranger in town easi-ly . Strangers are extremely careful not to look up at tall buildings , for fear they will he spotted . They are unable to board a Fifth Avenue bus except after fearful experimentation . They overtip and are under the impression that the only places that sell theatre tickets are agencies . Our own problem is to make ourself look like a New Yorker . Somehow , in spite of our fine clothes and worldly ways , nobody ever takes us for a native . Beggars , ? street photographers , men who have just located a nice fur piece , all spot us instantly as fair game . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have lived in New York all our life , the place never seems anything but slightly incredible , and we go along with our mouth open and our face unbuttoned . THE Lindherghs ' pilgrimage , in I search of a land where they hope to find privacy and peace , reverses the voyage of the Pilgrim Fathers , who left England in search of a country where they could live and worship as they pleased . The cycle is now complete . One reason privacy is so hard to achieve in the United States is that so few people really want it . When our most distinguished families lend their names and their photographs to cigarette promotion , one can hardly believe that there exists any widespread desire for privacy . A friend of ours has been telling us of a revealing experience he had recently in the Grand Central Terminal . He was stopped by a man who whipped out a pad and pencil and began questioning him closely on his tea-drinking habits ? " for a survey we are making . " Our friend found himself obligingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was certainly nobody 's business but his own . A little later he wondered why the devil he had submitted to any such impertinence . It seemed to him to indicate a complete breakdown of the sense of privacy . AWRITER is in an odd spot when it comes to maintaining a private life . His product , by its very nature , tends to make him a public character . The accepted notion in this country is that a writer should project his person and his name , along with his work . If he shows any disinclination to do so , if he puts up any resistance to the world 's insistent efforts to publicize him , he is regarded as either a poseur or a nut . THE evacuation by the Lindbergh family has left a lot of dust in the air , as it was bound to . The question has come up whether there is something fundamentally unsound in our law enforcement . Mayor LaGuardia 's reaction was certainly unsound enough for anybody 's taste  --  his idle boast that he would " drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one weakness in American law-enforcement officials is that they are , by temperament , negative . An Irish cop is an example of what we mean . He is courageous , wise to what 's going on , fairly persistent when he undertakes something , but he 's too hard to arouse . Try to win his attention , and you find that his lassitude is almost theatrical . As a servant of The Right , he is heavy , compromising , and negative . The one thing he dreads is that he will be caught showing an interest in something that perhaps turns out in the end to be unworthy of his attention . The other day we happened to see a taxi back into a man and knock him down . The man was hurt , and needed help . Noticing a patrolman in a cigarstore , we went in and explained that he was wanted outside . His attitude was one of weary distrust , as though he were listening to a long cock-and-bull story . OO UR little nephew got lots of things for Christmas  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goodness knows what all . Of all his gifts , though , the one we liked best is a game called Politics . Politics is kind of hard to explain , but we can give you enough of the idea of it for you to understand our enthusiasm . There 's a map of the United States , marked out by counties , and colored pins for marking off counties that have been won  --  a different color for each player . The players are each given a million dollars in stage money , and the idea of the game , roughly , is to use it wisely and obtain an electoral majority . " Managerial skill and good judgment arc more important than luck in playing the game , " says the rule book . Each player starts by paying $250,000 into the " expense fund , " a sort of pot which goes to the eventual winner of the game . For paying $20,000 to the expense fund , he is allowed to make a radio speech ; that is , play a card saying , " I declare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ races , " thus winning counties in California , New Mexico , and Arizona ; or one saying , " I declare in favor of government regulation but not abolition of utility holding companies , " winning counties in New York , Massachusetts , and Connecticut . Sometimes there is bidding among the candidates for the privilege of declaring in favor of a popular issue . The instruction hook reaches the height of realism under the heading " Campaign ' and . " " The million dollars in scrip given to each player at the beginning of the game is his campaign fund , " it says sternly , " and , to insure its use strategically , is given on the understanding that he may nut obtain any more . " We could n't help thinking that it would make a fine game for Young Republicans . The Great Chalice HUNDREDS of persons , including two excited out-of-towners who coaxed us along one day , have made the pilgrimage to the Brooklyn Museum to see the Great Chalice of Antioch . Some of the pilgrims have . gazed upon it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veritable Holy Grail ; others have viewed it with the calmer eye of the antiquarian ; a few , like a lady who was there when we were , have been frankly disappointed ; she said fur all to hear that it could n't come up to the things in Ovington 's , despite all the fuss that was made about it . She had expected , apparently , a brightly shining silver punch bowl . The Chalice of Antioch is smallish by comparison , and its silver is dull , almost lead-colored , except fora tawny sheen in certain lights ( it was gilded once , some nineteen hundred Christmases ago ) . The Museum has displayed it with almost harsh directness . You push open the big outside portals and you come upon it abruptly in the middle of the main lobby . It is set in a large rectangular showcase without softening light or mellow background , spang in the centre of a huge , chill room . The precious ancient relic looks a little bleak and forlorn . A lone policeman guards the Chalice . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , eying with mild wonder the twenty or more pilgrims who had braved the raw morning to stare at an old dark goblet . The Chalice is , as you know , perhaps the finest and easily the most renowned of all specimens of early Christian silverwork . It was made , they say , less than fifty years after the Crucifixion . There is a plain oval-shaped inner cup , contained in a delicate and charmingly wrought outer cup , which , if you peer close , pressing your nose against the glass , reveals twelve figures , two of which experts have pronounced to he the figure of the Saviour . Ten different saints have been identified , too , and there are dozens of other symbols . On just two of these , an eagle and a basket , one archeologist ten years ago wrote a solemn and profound piece . There have been hundreds of monographs on the Chalice . The most expensive work , in two volumes , sells fur $250 . On a wall of the main floor arc framed photographs of various details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the figures which on the cup itself are less than an inch high are here magnified ten times . Also on view are a lesser chalice , unadorned ; three silver hook covers ; and a silver cross . The Chalice , together with the other objects , was found not by a reverent Pereeval or Galahad in the dim centuries , but twenty-five years ago by a group of squabbling Arab laborers who were digging for profit in the ruins of a cathedral built in Antioch by Constantine the Great . It was sold , for a price never revealed , to the Kouchakji family , a firm of Syrian art dealers in Paris . The Chalice was kept in Paris until the war and then sent here for safekeeping . It is in the hands of Mr. Fahim Kouchakji , who lives here , and it is not for sale , It has been shown only twice before in public , in Paris and at the Chicago Fair . After this exhibition ( which closes January 6th ) , Mr. Kouchakji will put the Chalice hack in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rests . Once in a long while he takes a friend or a scientist down to the vault for a look at the relic , but most of the time it reposes there in darkness and silence . We asked Mr. Kouchakji one day if he knew the name of the particular Arab who dug up the Chalice . " I have no idea , " he said . " It was found by a s ) ndicate of sixteen Arabs . " To get to it now , you take the New Lots line of the West Side subway and get off at the Brooklyn Museum . Necessity WE 'RE told of a vaudeville actor WE 'RE was filling in an application for a WPA theatre project . He stated his experience and general qualifications in the spaces provided on the blank ; then , at the bottom , he wrote , " Must have boxing kangaroo  --  mine died . " Lone Wolf WE know about a fellow from out of town who lived for some weeks at the Waldorf , all alone , rather sumptuously , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that , although on other evenings only one bed was turned hack , on Saturday nights both beds were turned back . This set all kinds of thoughts running through his head ; it did seem that the management was giving him a gentle poke in the ribs . Anyway , the matter so titillated his fancy that he traced it down , and found that on Saturdays a substitute maid was on duty and she did n't know that the room had only one occupant . It was as simple as that . If any of our readers are short-story writers , do n't say we never give you good material to work on . Macstro &; Schema DRIFTING about this lavish town of ours is the greatest fencer in the world , a tall , slim , neat-featured Italian gent of thirty-six , Suave as anything . The name is Aldo Nadi . His American data , in which he mowed down local-talent swordsmen , took place in the ballroom of the Plaza --  general admission , five-fifty  --  and reminded us vaguely of a concert by a fashionable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance billed as a recital . Aldo likes to think of himself as an artist rather than an athlete . He does n't make the faintest pretence of training for his bouts , ? he stays up late , drinks , and goes out with girls all the time . Considering it both an obligation and a good investment to keep upthe social tone of fencing , he lives at the Savoy-Plaza and lunches every day at the Colon ) Restaurant . Perhaps you 've seen him . We met Aldo the other afternoon , and he told us the story of his life , with little or no false modesty . The only word he can find for his position in the fencing world is " cavzpioni , , simo . " He said that the road to becoming camfrinnissimo is a long , hard one ; you have to begin when you 're a tot in a pinafore , and ca n't expect to reach your prime before you are thirty-five . Aldo had a slight head start  --  his father was the great Ileppe Nadi of Leghorn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to make such fine fencers of his sons ( Aldo has an elder brother , Nedra that they could in time prove the superiority of the Italian school of fencing over the French . Italians fence with the foil strapped to the wrist , jumping in and out with their thrusts , while the Frenchslide the hilt of the foil hack and forth in the hand , gaining the extra length required fur a thrust without jumping . The jump-versus-slide thing has been going on for some three centuries now , with no prospect of ever being settled . When the Nadi boys first got into international fencing , in the early twenties , a M. Gaudin , a non-jumping Frenchman , had things pretty well under control . Aldo heat him , but a couple of years later M. Gaudin heat him . " He had five French judges " is the way Aldo explains this . They arranged a third meeting , but without judges , because they had n't been able to agree about whom to select . The entire sporting press of Italy and France 1/6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the match was over , it was discovered that all the Italian journalists had picked Aldo , and all the French M. Gaudin . The two never met again . Gaudin retired after the 1928 Olympic Gaines ; and , with the retirement of ? his brother , Aldo was left , as the French themselves have to admit , hors classy . He even conducts a salle d'ames right in Paris , where he charges each pupil a thousand francs a month  --  and teaches him to jump . Oh , yes , Aldo has been in a real duel . There was , he told us , an eccentric European sporting writer who evolved the quaint notion of becoming famous by insulting all the best fencers of Italy . He was moderately stabbed by both Nadis and George Santelli , the present fencing coach of the New York Athletic Club , and seemed quite pleased by the whole business , Aldo said . We asked Aldo about his plans for the future . He admitted that he had an eye on Hollywood ; considers they need him there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he has a divorce pending . He married an Englishwoman , who has , he thinks , divorced him in California . " But that would n't he recognized in Italy , " he ? says gravely , " so I must divorce her in Switze eland . " Lull A GENTLEMAN was standing 1 in the men 's room at the Grand Central the other day , and overheard a conversation between an attendant and a Red Cap who had just strolled in . " How are things outside ? " the attendant asked . " Quiet , " said the Red Cap . " Very quiet . " " Quiet in here , too , " said the attendant . Godsend J UST to prove that life now and then outstrips Mark Bellinger and  --  what was his name ? ? O. Henry , we 're going to tell you the story of the two Malcolm Johnsons . The first Malcolm Johnson is the Sun 's night-club reporter . On Christmas Eve , the Paradise Restaurant , brimming ' over with good will toward night-club writers , dispatched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the address they found in the telephone directory-102 East Twenty-second Street . The next day they called up the Sun office and asked Mr. Johnson if he had received his little present all right . Mr. Johnson said no , he had n't ; where had it been sent ? " To 102 East Twenty-second Street , " the Paradise Restaurant said sharply . " There 's only one Malcolm Johnson in the phone book . " " Well , " said the Sun Malcolm Johnson , " it 's not me . " This worried the Paradise Restaurant terribly , and they sent a man down to East Twenty-second Street to see what was up . He rang the bell at No. 102 , and a happy-looking man answered . An enormous party was going on within . " Did you , " said the Paradise emissary , " happen to get some liquor from the Paradise yesterday ? " " I sure did , " said the other Mr. Johnson . " And net only that , but every other night club in town sent some . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a drink . " It turned out that the Twenty-second Street Johnson works for Doubleday , Doran and does n't bother much about night clubs . Does n't have to , if it comes to that . Nuisance WE know nobody who gets more sheer pleasure out of his financial life than a young man named Lewis D. Gilbert , who lives quietly at 1165 Park Avenue and devotes most of his time to attending stockholders ' meetings . His modest holdings  --  anywhere from five to a hundred shares per company  --  give him a voice in the annual meetings of about fifty big corporations . That 's without going outside of the metropolitan area , too ; this year he plans to branch out a hit and take in some of the meetings held in small , inaccessible upstate towns . Might even get down to Delaware , where a dozen or so of his companies meet . Corporations hate Mr. Gilbert ; one time a corporation lawyer , exasperated beyond control , bawled at him , " I wish you were dead . " But , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Anybody who assaults a stockholder is laying himself open to a suit . That 's the law . " And there , in a nutshell , is the reason for Mr. Gilbert 's unpopularity : he 's always insisting on his rights . He says that stockholders , however small , have lots of rights which are ignored by autocratic officials . He always insists on examining the minute books of the board of directors and the list of shareholders , and usually pops up , after the annual report has been read , with one or two embarrassing questions . Once in a while a corporation starts an investigation of Mr. Gilbert 's private affairs , in the hope of bringing to light some hidden financial connection which might account for his zealousness , but without success . Mr. Gilbert lives blamelessly on a smallish inherited income and keeps himself clean for his crusade by avoiding any kind of work , so that no pressure can he brought to bear on him through an employer . Insists he 's just an average small stockholder , with what ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has invested in . The whole thing started back in 1932 , when Mr. Gilbert was twenty-five . He dropped in on the annual meeting of the Consolidated Gas Company , thinking that stockholders would naturally be welcomed . " But that , " he told us bitterly , " was a rather naive thought . " Whatever went on at the meeting ( Mr. Gilbert was bitter but rather vague ) , it was enough to make it war between him and the big companies from that day on . He read up on corporation law , and even got to be a sufficient authority on etiquette to he able to correct Winthrop Aldrich , who was presiding at the last annual meeting of the Chase National Bank . Mr. Gilbert was asking pertinent questions . about the conduct of the business , and Mr. Aldrich cut in with " How many shares do you own ? " " That 's an improper question , " 11,1r . Gilbert retorted . It was , too ; Mr. Aldrich had to withdraw it . ( Mr. Gilbert has ten shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squabble with Percy Johnston of the Chemical Bank &; Trust because the annual report criticized Roosevelt 's monetary policy ; the meeting wound up with everybody on his feet , shouting , and was followed by an exchange of written apologies . Mr. Gilbert does n't fight with all chairmen , though ; he admires Harvey Gibson ( Manufacturers Trust ) , Clarence Woolley ( American Radiator ) , and Edward J. Cornish ( Patino Mines ) . They know their business , and they 're not afraid of questions , he says . Macy 's , American Can , R.C.A. , General Foods , and Otis Elevator all conduct their meetings well ; and since Mr. Gilbert began to take an interest , A. T. &; T. , American Tobacco , Union Carbide , and Air Reduction have shown distinct improvement . Consolidated Gas he regards as incorrigible . A number of his stockholding friends have chipped in with proxies , and this year Mr. Gilbert will go to some of his meetings with a thousand or so shares . People write from all over , asking for financial advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Outside of finance , he has few interests ; he collects stamps , reads economics , and goes abroad once in a while ( the annual-meeting season is only from January to July ) . He 's not a radical ; believes firmly in capitalism . Heaven knows why , considering his experiences . He just does . Namesake AHUNGRY couple wandered into the Dixie Restaurant , on East Forty-sixth Street , and decided to have some nice , old-fashioned Southern conking . The headwaiter seemed abashed when they asked for fried chicken ; said the restaurant did n't have Southern cooking . " No Southern cooking at the Dixie ? " said the lady of the party , considerably surprised . " Oh , the name , " said the headwaiter . " We got that from the name of the cement company which occupied these premises before us. "
