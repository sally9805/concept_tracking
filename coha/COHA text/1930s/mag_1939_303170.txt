Mr. Chamberlain 's Chancellor of the Exchequer and Inner Cabinet confidant , Sir John Simon , is cold and devious , a lawyer whose poker face and ambiguous , clausy rhetoric are well adapted to muddling through . Devious and poker-faced as ever last week , Sir John took steps definite enough to jolt the bowler-hatted businessmen of London 's " City . " He mobilized the Bank of England and the London Stock Exchange to impose " Simon 's unofficial ban " on British buying of U. S. securities . <P> No law was passed , no edict issued . Investors were simply advised that their cash is needed at home to finance rearmament , that the pound sterling must not be weakened by further flight of capital . This step towards totalitarian economics produced no excitement . Sir John simply wished , and British-fashion , business " assented . " <P> But for England , traditionally the world 's banker , and for Wall Street , now the world 's safe deposit box , Sir John Simon 's order to investors to " Buy British " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith . Under it , Britain found that capital export opened markets , expanded prosperity across national boundaries , employed surplus British wealth . Today , British capital is no longer exported in this sense ; it flees , and its flight is at this time a drain on national resources . <P> Germany , Italy and Japan have found a way to stop this drain . But they did so by violating capitalism 's unwritten Magna Charta : That money must have a right to go wherever it can make profits and avoid losses . In Britain , this right has now been suspended by Sir John Simon 's dictum : " The export of capital . . . would be deleterious to the national interest . " <P> Since January , Sir John has been planning to float a rearmament loan of $1,500,000,000-three times as much as the British have spent buying U. S. securities since 1935 . For some time he has been hinting that he could not raise all this money so long as Englishmen remained free to put their investment cash into U. S. securities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had shipped $500,000,000 to the U. S. , now have about $1,000,000,000 invested in marketable U. S. securities . Silent pressure has gradually reduced the flow , since first of the year it has subsided . Sir John has bottled up all the potential refugee cash that did not escape before . Only bounders will persist in selling pounds and buying dollars , but the British Government has marvelously effective ways of cracking down by the use of " influence . " Thus one month after Britain had begun conscripting men , preparations were being made to conscript wealth , too-by consent . <P> U. S. economists began discussing the possible consequences of Britain 's silent change of economic front : <P> &gt; Except for normal commercial transactions and British Government payments for arms purchases , Britain , possessor of the world 's No. 2 gold hoard ( about $3,000,000,000 plus the hidden treasure of India and the mines of the Rand ) , will no longer add to the top-heavy U. S. gold cache ( $15,867,000,000 ) , some 60% of the world 's supply . This means that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is of no present use to the U. S. , in exchange for valuable U. S. securities and commodities .
