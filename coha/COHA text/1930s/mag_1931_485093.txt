TO PRESIDENT HOOVER 'S APPEAL for nation- wide support for the drive for funds to care for the unemployed victims of our acquisitive economic system , we hope all the readers of The Nation will respond , even though they should feel , as we do , that the government is shirking its solemn duty in not assuming this responsibility . Mr. Hoover is of course correct , despite his " sob-stuff " rhetoric , in declaring that " no one with a spark of human sympathy can contemplate unmoved the possibilities of suffering . . . " in the coming winter . People are already dying of undernourishment , which means starvation , in all our large cities . Eyerywhere the depression has reduced men and women to despair , wiped out their savings , and deprived them of all hope for the future . Not to give " until it hurts " under these circumstances would be to show oneself callous indeed . That the dole will come if the depression lasts another two years is certain . Meanwhile , however , private benevolence will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves hard hit by the depression it ought to be possible to raise the sums asked  --  only $12,000,000 in New York City . Whether this sum will be large enough , in addition to the amounts voted by the municipality and the State , to care adequately for the 750,000 men and women in the metropolis now officially reported unemployed remains to be seen . WHEN THE FINANCIAL HISTORY of the present time comes to be written , our children will surely read with incredulity that in 1931 , when the United States had in its vaults $5,000,000,000 of gold  --  nearly half the world supply  --  foreign holders of credit began withdrawing gold in the fear that we were going to abandon the gold basis ! It is a situation to which only the author of " Alice in Wonderland " could really do justice , and the most striking illustration we have so far had of the unreasoning hysteria which has seized the world . Panic , of course , always tends to create the very event it fears : it has done so for Germany and England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gold standard that has caused many people now to think that nothing is too incredible or ridiculous to be believed . Less than four weeks after England 's suspension of the gold standard , it is true , the Federal Reserve system has lost $650,000,000 in gold , a loss which breaks all records for so short a period ; the largest previous export of gold in any month was $100,000,000 in June , 1928 . But even with the present loss , our gold supply is still as great as it was in the spring of 1929 , when the chief concern of European and American economists was how our unparalleled holdings could be better distributed . Though the system 's reserve ratio has fallen in the last four weeks from 78 per cent to 62 per cent , the latter ratio is still ample . Moreover , it would be higher than it is were it not for an increase in note circulation in the same period of $605,000,000 , an increase made necessary at least in part by the hoarding of paper money by our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to Europe would be an event to be greeted with real satisfaction . While we may still view the outflow calmly , there are several considerations which greatly reduce the satisfaction that might otherwise be felt . One is the very rapid rate of the withdrawal , which may prove slightly unsettling . Another is the fact that the gold is being withdrawn because of senseless panic , not because of basic changes in the flow of international trade . A third is that 80 per cent of the gold has been going , not to England or Germany , where it would prove most helpful , but to the one other country in the world that does not need it ? France . So far as our own position goes , it is quite clear that the Federal Reserve banks can offer gold without endangering their reserves far longer than foreigners will have the credit balances to enable them to pay for the gold . Meanwhile , one hardly knows whether the innuendoes reflecting on the dollar 's safety that have been appearing recently in a large number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or for their unscrupulousness . It would be illuminating to know not only who is inspiring them , but for what purpose .
