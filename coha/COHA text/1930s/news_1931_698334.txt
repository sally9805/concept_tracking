txt Mr. Rogers Is Really GIad Dawes Has Stopped the War To the Editor of The Nato York Timea : ABOARD S. S. EMPRESS OF RUSSIA , Dec. ** ocean is just as innocent looking today , just like it had n't done a thing . We have followed the great circle route and swung away up north . If we had gone ashore I would have been telling my Republican jokes to an Esquimox , and I expect the Republicans wish they was with the Esquimox about now . This morning 's wireless reports Tom Mix better , which is good news . He has given many a grownUp and all kids a thrill . In 1905 at Madison Square Garden Tom and I made our New York horseback debut with Zack Mulhall 's Wild West . Sure glad Charley Dawes has stopped this war and I can change my trip into a kimona shopping tour of Japan and China . Yours , WILL ROGERS .
