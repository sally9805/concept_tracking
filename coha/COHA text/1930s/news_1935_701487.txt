txt EXCERPTS FROM LETTERS ON SUBJECTS OF CURRENT INTEREST Justified . The League of Nations has justified the claims made for it . So far as has been humanly possible , it has tirelessly and effectively used its power to prevent the war of aggression against Ethiopia undertaken by the Italian dictator . In accordance with the unanimous decision of the League , Italy will be declared an international outlaw subject to the penalties which had previously been agreed upon by Italy herself together with all other members of the League . This is the first time in history that a civilized nation has been condemned by the entire world for undertaking an unjustifiable war , and the credit for this is directly due to the League . Under these circumstances , our own country appears in a light more discreditable than ever for having acted the part of a piker in refusing to cooperate with other nations in the establishment a this great factor for international peace. ?
