Special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canadian farm mortgages , already reduced to the lowest point in the history of the Dominion , are due to be further cut by the operation of the Central Mortgage Bank , which will undoubtedly have a marked effect upon long-term borrowing in the nation . Not only will the bank make it possible for existing mortgage rates in its field to be reduced to 5 per cent , provide for the writing off of arrears and principal to 80 per cent of the fair market value of the land , but it will make available new money at rock-bottom rates . The new rate will be about 2 per cent above that which the Federal Government pays for its money . It now borrows long term funds at about 3 per cent . While the bank will directly concern only those borrowers who are indebted to the 60 major financial institutions the readjustment of the basis of long term borrowing will react throughout the entire structure as debt arrangement plans have in the past ten years .

Under the Voluntary Debt Adjustment plan offered in 1937 to the three Prairie Provinces by the Federal Government and accepted by the Manitoba and Saskatchewan the machinery for the further scaling down of debt was established and farm mortgage rates were reduced to S per cent . Premier William Aberhart of Alberta refused to enter into the plan but through individual contact with borrowers the loan companies made the agreed rate available to the farmers of that province .

For that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one time is made difficult and leaves the agreed rates on institutional mortgages as the only indicator of the trend . That trend has definitely been downward in recent years because not only have the loan companies written off millions in principal but they have made an effort to , gear the cost to the ability of the farmer to pay . In Western Canada the loan companies voluntarily slashed $20,000,000 in debt from their books and the Saskatchewan Government added another $30 , - 000,000 reduction to this total . While no arbitrary figure can be given , the influences of the past 10 years have been such as to drive the average mortgage rate close to 6 per cent . The operation of the bank will have the effect of de pressing it still further .
