txt Mr. Rogers Fails to Read His Paper and Is Sorry TO the Editor of The New York Times : BEVERLY HILLS , Calif. , March 5 . ? I missed President Roosevelt 's speech this morning . ( It was S o'clock here . ) Yes , I was tip in time , but here is the joke on me . I had n't read a about it in the papers . Now I will have to read it . But there is a great difference between him talking , and then just rending it . He is the , king . of the air . Course he has the - advantage of the rest alas . He do n't come on the air till he has something to say and the rest of us , we have to come on when we . have nothing to say . Not changing the subject too soon , but I feel kinder sorry for . that woman Sheriff in Indiana . She thought she was surrounded by men . Yours , WILL ROGERS .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
