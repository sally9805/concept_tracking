" It was the sponsored program i. e. advertising that saved broadcasting from extinction . The goodwill of the public can be gained through broadcasting only by giving the public what it wants to hear . " - Merlin Hall Aylesworth , president of National Broadcasting Co . <P> " . . . So to us it seems perfectly natural that advertising and not a license fee as in England should ' pay the freight ' . . . when it comes to broadcasting . " - William S. Paley , president of Columbia Broadcasting System . <P> Every evening , a half hour after Pepsodent 's Amos ' n Andy sign off , Pepsodent 's " Goldbergs " sign on . This program , a continued story of the fortunes of a middle-class Jewish family , was created for her own amusement by one Mrs. Gertrude Edelstein Berg of Manhattan . At the instance of friends she offered it to NBC , which took it as a sustaining feature in 1929 . The part of Mother Goldberg was taken by Authoress Berg herself , who said it represented her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondary battery to supplement their Amos ' n Andy . <P> Last month Pepsodent announced that the program might be discontinued unless enough listeners wrote letters asking for its retention . ( As an inducement , a beetle-ware tumbler was offered to every writer who sent in part of a Pepsodent carton . ) Candidly Pepsodent admitted it wanted strong evidence that the expense of two nation-wide programs every night was justified . Last week Pepsodent announced that the returns warranted keeping " The " Goldbergs . " <P> Last year TIME made its large-scale radio debut on Columbia Broadcasting System with a program every Friday evening , called " The March of Time , " a half-hour 's re-enactment of significant news stories of the week . The feature won instant popularity with a smaller audience than " The Goldbergs " and was often called " the only intelligent broadcast on the air . " Last week it was announced that " The March of Time , " having completed its pre-arranged schedule of presentations , would be discontinued , at least temporarily . Listeners were invited to write letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time " to be brought back to the air . ( No beetle-ware tumblers were offered , since it is contrary to TIME 'S policy to offer any inducements except its own merits . ) The letters received last week were distinguished not by their volume , but by their insistence-in some cases indignant-that the program be retained for its educational value , its adult mentality . Typical : " Under no condition deprive the American public of the education and the pleasure . . . . " <P> " Its removal from the air would constitute an irreparable loss . . . " <P> " Would you force your listeners to a life of listening to toothpaste propaganda and vacuum-headed crooners ? " <P> " I realize that TIME itself may dispense with this feature as an advertisement , but your radio audience can ill afford to lose such a delightful source of information . "
