As thunder follows lightning , so grumbling follows the annual award of the Pulitzer Prizes . This year 's controversy centred around the placid , bespectacled head of Arthur Krock , chief of the New York Times Washington bureau , whose exclusive , authorized interview with President Roosevelt in February 1937-the only one given in five years-won him the $500 prize for distinguished Washington correspondence . <P> White House correspondents work on the understanding that the President plays no favorites , grants no exclusive interviews . Krock 's colleagues , good and sore , promptly obtained from Press Secretary Stephen Early a promise that this kind of thing would never happen again . Many newshawks felt the interview appearing during the fight on the Supreme Court Bill had been planted . Last fortnight . Earl Godwin , Washington Times reporter and president of the White House Correspondents ' Association , carried the controversy to Dean Carl Ackerman of the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism , where Pulitzer possibilities are sifted : " If , as some say , this story was actually inspired or planted , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prize-winning achievement for Mr. Krock ? ... If the President or the White House planted this story , then I should say that Mr. Roosevelt himself should share the prize . " <P> Best-informed Washington opinion last week was : That the interview was Correspondent Krock 's own idea , that it was originally intended as a background Sunday story in which the President would recapitulate his views ; that Mr. Krock was closeted with the President for an hour-and-a-half in the White House oval study ; that the entire interview was then submitted to the President , who suggested new insertions and approved its use as a news story-even approved the headlines . But all Mr. Krock would say was : " No comment . "
