U. S. doctors are educated to treat disease chiefly by means of drugs and surgery . Nonetheless , they habitually use such homely adjuncts as hot and cold applications , baths and massage . In recent years some doctors analyzed the therapeutic effect of such physical agents , tried their hands at others . As a result a new specialty of physical medicine gradually developed . Called physical therapists , such doctors treat disease by heat , massage , baths , exercise , rest , work , radiation and electricity . The specialty is still not sharply defined . On one hand physical therapists must combat the tendency of other doctors to treat them as if they were simply operators of medical machines . On the other hand physical therapists must combat the bumptiousness of their technicians who actually operate the machines and call themselves physiotherapists . This confusion is gradually resolving itself . Technicians distinguish themselves as members of the American Physiotherapy Association which met in Los Angeles ten weeks ago ( TIME , July 13 ) , and the American Registry of Physical Therapy Technicians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met in Manhattan last week . There they described the following procedures and results of their art : <P> Operation Gauge . To tell whether a patient is apt to die of shock as result of an operation , take his pulse and blood pressure while he lies down and again while he stands up , advised Dr. Charles Ward Crampton of Manhattan . The figures indicate the patient 's vasotone efficiency according to a chart which Dr. Crampton showed the physical therapists , declaring : <P> " If the vasotone is poor to a certain point , the patient certainly will die during or after the operation , no matter how good the surgeon or the surgery . <P> " To cope with this , where there are low readings , the operation is postponed until by rest and the use of digitalis the patient 's vasotone is raised beyond the danger point . When the readings are low , but immediate surgery is imperative the surgeon must expect trouble , employ speed , spare trauma and select the less severe operative procedure , such as draining an organ rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hans Jacob Behrend of Manhattan considers cold showers perilous . Said he : " Those in robust health and with good circulation can overcome the strain engendered by the cold shower . But those less fortunate , particularly weak , anemic and older people , may suffer serious damages as a result of it . Colds , feebleness and fatigue are some of the harmful effects of the cold shower habit . . . . I would not advise any one to take a cold shower . " <P> Best time to bathe , according to Dr. Behrend , is just before going to bed . <P> Shrinking Drinks . To demonstrate how rapidly capillaries react to heat and cold . Dr. Fred Bennett Moor of Los Angeles had a fellow doctor take a drink of ice water while holding his arm immersed in a tank of water . Soon as the cold drink made itself felt in the demonstrator 's stomach , water level in the tank fell measurably , thus indicating that the cooled stomach drew blood from the capillaries of the arm . Consequently the capillaries shrank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes must have some effect on heart and lungs , argued Dr. Moor , urging doctors to search for such changes .
