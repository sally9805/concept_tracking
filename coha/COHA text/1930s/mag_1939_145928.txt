Since studious , balding Clare Bunch , 36 , took over St. Louis ' Monocoupe Corp . four years ago and found only $20 in the bank account , he has made things hum at that tidy little airplane factory . Oil-stained apostle of hard work , he slept in the plant , did all his own test-flying , worked with the factory hands when he was not busy at the drawing board improving the basic Monocoupe , a two-seated monoplane ( $3,875 ) , or designing a bigger two-engined job . Last week , with the bank account considerably more than $20 , Clare Bunch lifted his nose from the grindstone and went out to publicize his planes . <P> With two ham sandwiches and a jug of coffee , he took off from Burbank , Calif. in one of his two-seaters , climbed his heavily loaded craft to 12,000 ft. and headed east . Averaging 30 miles to the gallon , he kept his Monocoupe on top of an overcast most of the way , kept himself on the course by listening to range stations on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Field , N. Y. next day , tired and chilled , he had set a new transcontinental light-plane record : 23 hours and 26 minutes , an average of 110 m.p.h . Cost of the trip , exclusive of sandwiches , coffee and depreciation : $27.15 . Result : a fat sheaf of inquiries from pilots , to some of whom Monocoupe hopes to sell airplanes . Said satisfied Mr. Bunch : " I made the flight for my own satisfaction . "
