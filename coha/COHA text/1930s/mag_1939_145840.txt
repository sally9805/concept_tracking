When a symphony orchestra has been slapped around by a heavyweight conductor for a few seasons , it gets very proud of its bumps and bruises . When the top-flight conductor resigns , and a bantamweight takes his place , the orchestra is apt to sulk . In the past few years two of the finest U. S. symphony orchestras have had this letdown : Manhattan 's Philharmonic-Symphony ( Toscanini to Barbirolli ) ; the Philadelphia Orchestra ( Stokowski to Eugene Ormandy ) . The Philharmonikers have kept a stiff upper lip , but the Philadelphians , after brooding and glooming for a whole season , last week broke out in a williwaw . <P> The thing that did it was a short return engagement of their beloved onetime musical director , Leopold Stokowski . First storm-signals flew when word leaked out that Conductor Ormandy had fired fuzzy-headed first cellist , Isadore Gusikoff , because Gusikoff " made him nervous . " Cellist Gusikoff promptly sued for the rest of his season 's pay , proudly admitted that he had conducted a " silence strike " while sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " poetry , imagination , subtlety and humor . " Two other men resigned in sympathy . Said the orchestra 's manager , curly-haired Socialite Alfred Reginald Allen : " Things are n't like they used to be . " He resigned too . With its once-remunerative radio dates gone , and its budget badly off balance , outlook for the orchestra seemed squally . Leopold Stokowski preserved his beautiful calm . He purred : " If Philadelphia is solidly behind our orchestra , the disturbing influences can be stopped . If I can do anything to help , I will be so glad . " At week 's end it looked as though Heavyweight Stokowski might indeed help , by returning to the Philadelphia Orchestra next season as chief conductor .
