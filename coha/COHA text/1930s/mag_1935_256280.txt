Most newsreaders remember Starr Faithfull , if they bother to remember her at all , as a pretty young girl whose bruised body , with veronal in the liver , was washed ashore at Long Beach , N. Y. one day in June four years ago ( TIME , June 29 , 1931 ) . Partly because of her incredible name , partly because of her spectacular sex life , the Press quickly picked up all that was left of Starr Faithfull and gave it to the nation as a hot weather sensation . With the mystery of the girl 's death still unsolved , the story eventually collapsed . But newspaper publishers had not heard the last of Starr Faithfull . Her stepfather , Stanley Faithfull . lean , gimlet-eyed , red-whiskered and eccentric , started libel actions against every newspaper in Manhattan . <P> Father Faithfull began with criminal actions alleging libel against himself and against the memory of his dead daughter , tried to have Publisher Joseph Medill Patterson of the New York Daily News arrested , but a magistrate refused to issue a warrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the News . Father Faithfull asked $350,000 damages because , he claimed : 1 ) the News had intimated that he murdered his daughter ; 2 ) the News had said he concealed evidence in the case , hampering the authorities ; 3 ) the News had said he and his wife lived on his late daughter 's earnings as a prostitute ; 4 ) the News had called him a blackmailer ; 5 ) the News had said that Father &; Mother Faithfull married , each with the expectation that the other was wealthy . On some points the News denied it had said anything of the sort . <P> The trial went on for more than three weeks . Last week a Staten Island jury found the New York Daily News innocent of libel .
