txt President Hoover today set for his ad , ministrative officers the task of cutting appropriations for the next . fiscal year by " at leasr $500,000,000 from the funds voted at the last session of Congress . In a letter addressed to the executives ' of all governmental activities , he ordered that they give a renewed study looking to the elimination of every expenditure not absolutely necessary in the next fiscal year . Increasingly of the opinion that the low tide of the depression has been reached and that recovery Is actually in progress , the President told his department heads that a large part , of the reduction ordered could be made up by a diminution Alf constructioriaetivities which have ben speeded up as an aid to amplestment . " I believe we can reasonably predicate our budget in the confidence that such expenditures will be less necessary for employment purposes after June of next year , " the President said in his letter . He emphasized that nothing would contribute more to recovery than relief from the heavy taxation made necessary by the rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a particular study of readjustments which can be made only by Congress . He recalled that recommendations for reductions of this type were made to Congress at the last session , but failed of authorization . Such amounts as could be saved in that manner now , he said , would be in addition to the $500,000,000 which today he set as a goal for the executive branch of his administration . The President 's Instructions . The President 's instructions to the various executives read : The budgets of the different departments and independent agencies for the year beginning July 1 , 1933 , are now under discussion with the Bureau of the Budget . A study of the preliminary estimate shows that all parts of the government are making great effort toward economies . I desire , however , that the responsible heads shall give renewed study looking to the elimination of every expenditure not absolutely essential to these times . I have asked the Director of the Budget to make every effort to secure a reduction of at least $500 , - 000,000 in the estimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the current year , and the cooperation of the responsible administrative officers is necessary to achieve this end . A part of this can be accomplished in reduction of construction activities which have been so greatly speeded up during the past few years as an aid to employment . I believe we can reasonably predicate our budget in the confidence that such expenditures will be less necessary for employment purposes after June of next year . Moreover , thcse works by virtue of the enormous outlay since 1930 as a means of employment will be in many particulars in advance of the country 's immediate need . Other activities can well be further curtailed during the period of recovery . Obviously nothing will more contribute to that recovery than a. relief from taxation . While the executives can budget various activities upon the lowest possible basis , still a large part of the government activities are fixed by law and they must be budgeted for expenditure . In some of these casds the whole or part of . the activities can only with the approval of Congress be suspended . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Director of the Budget with a view to preparing a detailed recommendation to the Congress for authority to take such action . You will recollect that during the last session of the Congress the departments proposed to various economy committees of the Congress reductions in expenditures of this type , which failed of authorization . Such amounts would be in addition to the $500,000,000 mentioned above and they should now be again exhaustively considered . Outlay Put at $4,000,000,000 . President Hoover has been holding daily conferences for the last two weeks with J. Clawson Roop , Director of the Bureau of the Budget . It was in these discussions that the $500,000,000 goal was set . Reduction of appropriations by this amount would place the outlay for the next fiscal year at slightly more than $4,000,000,000 and would take the present Congress out of the $10 , - 090,000,000 class attained by its predecessor . The total appropriations voted at the last session amounted to $4,761 , - 192,479.24 , against $5,618,546,098.18 in the fiscal year 1932 , or a reduction of more than $857,000,000 . An additional savings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the special economy act , making a gross reduction of more than $1,000,000,000 . Part of that budget reduction was carried out by the executive department . while 8334,000,000 was cut by Congress itself . Of appropriations for the current year , much of the total was for construction work and emergency relief in the unemployment crisis . The last session of Congress actually appropriated more than $5,745,000,000 , but of this a total of $984,000,000 was for the fiscal year 1932 , and included $500,000,000 for the Reconstruction Finance Corporation , $125,000,000 for additional capital subscriptions to the . Federal Land Banks , and $200 , - 000,000 for supplementary veterans ' relief . The field in which the President 's own executive officers may search for the $500,000,000 is limited by substantive law and permanent requirements , which Congress has hesitated to change . A total of $3,500,000,000 was considered at the last session to be virtually fixed charges . This figure included interest on the public debt of $640,000,000 ; sinking fund requirements of $. t76,800,000 ; veterans ' relief , $1,020,000,000 naval and military - service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
