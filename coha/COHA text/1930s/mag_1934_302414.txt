" No weight reducing compound in any form should be used unless the patient is under strict observation by a thoroughly qualified physician . " So declared Dr. Edward L. Bortz of Philadelphia to the American College of Physicians , meeting in Chicago last week . To such talk , patent medicine manufacturers and many a layman reply : " Humph , doctors trying to make more business for themselves ! " <P> Dr. Bortz was talking specifically about the latest weight reducing drug , Dinitrophenol , which burns up fat by speeding the body 's metabolic processes . In so doing it may also produce nausea , itching , rash . Taken in overlarge doses , it brings violent illness and death . A full study of the drug has not been completed , but it has been established that some people are especially sensitive to it . Last week Dr. Bortz advised doctors to test their patients for two weeks with extremely light doses . <P> Drug companies have flooded the land with Dinitrophenol ( usually under its right name , but one company calls it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it without prescription . Last fortnight two cases of sudden death from overdoses of the drug were reported to the Journal of the American Medical Association , one of a young woman in Los Angeles who followed directions on the box and died violently within a week . <P> Dinitrophenol has temporarily cast a shade over other reducing drugs and compounds . Hundreds of them are on the market , with widely varying formulas , but the facts about them are simple . Prime fact is that all are either harmful , worthless or both . Most are simply laxatives , for it is possible to reduce weight by hurrying food through the system before it can be properly digested . Some compounds contain thyroid extract which , by speeding metabolism , does reduce weight but with much possible harm . <P> For years the American Medical Association 's Bureau of Investigation has analyzed and exposed so-called obesity cures . The following are its verdicts on some better-known preparations : <P> Marmola : " A quack obesity cure of the thyroid type . " <P> Jad Salts : " If one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is quite unnecessary to buy Jad Salts in order to reduce-which , of course , is a fact-but that any reduction must be brought about by cutting down on the food intake . While this is the technical thesis of Jad Salts advertising the obvious intent seems to be to make the public believe that Jad Salts is an obesity cure . " <P> Lesser Slim Figure Bath : " Every physician knows . . . that this absurd mixture of cornstarch , borax , baking soda , etc. can have not the slightest effect in the reduction of weight . " <P> Citrophan : " There is no scientific evidence . . . that tetraiodophenolphthalein its active constituent will reduce weight except , possibly , by disturbing the digestive functions . " <P> Vannay : " Whatever reduction in weight may follow the use of Vannay is due to one or both of two factors : First , the laxative action and , second , the requirement - common to practically every obesity-cure nostrum on the market-that the victim , in taking it , should diet .
