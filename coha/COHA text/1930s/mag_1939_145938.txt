A common way for an art gallery to make a splash is to put on a " subject exhibition . " These range from stunt shows which purists deplore ( e.g. , " Great Rivers in Art " or " Paintings of Pigs " ) to loftier surveyals of important art forms . In the lofty class this week Manhattan 's rich M. Knoedler &; Co. presented " Classics of the Nude " - 31 pictures from Pollaiuolo to Picasso . This was a good idea . The linear play and complex modeling of the human body , the textures , transparencies and color subtleties of the skin , have made nude painting what Bernard Berenson called " the most absorbing problem of classic art . " To do the subject justice an exhibition would have to include several items not visible at Knoedler 's . Among them : 1 ) a nude by Giorgione , Titian 's great Venetian contemporary ; 2 ) an example of the mighty figure painting of Michelangelo ; 3 ) one of Rubens ' rubicund exaltations of Flemish flesh ; 4 ) more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old tradition and in the new . <P> But the show had both splendors and curiosities . One Renaissance painting shown for the first time in the U. S. was Tintoretto 's Lucretia and Tarquinius ( see cut ) , lent indefinitely by one of Paris ' apprehensive art collectors . One of the few first-rate Tintorettos to be seen outside Europe , the picture interested students for its Michelangelesque distortions ( as in Tarquinius ' leg ) , its hint of El Greco pattern in the nervous , lightning-like highlights on the strewn drapery , and such tricky details as the falling cushion and pearls , one of which is caught symbolically in Lucretia 's shift . <P> For sensuous space , serenity and golden sublimation , visitors could look on Titian 's Lady at the Mirror . Across the room Veronese 's Venus at her Toilet turned her opulent , cool and massive back . A pig-eyed , swollen-bellied little courtesan appeared in Lucas Cranach 's delicately painted Nymph Reposing . From the 17th Century came a dusky Landscape with Nymphs and Satyrs by France 's great Nicolas Poussin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 18th-and early 19th-Century France was almost too amply demonstrated in pictures by Watteau , Boucher , Baudouin , Girodet and Prud'hon . <P> In the 19th Century good painters generally quit regarding the female body as necessarily a subject for boudoir decoration , went hell-bent in two directions : moony romanticism and substantial realism . Several minor pictures illustrated the first ; Gustave Courbet 's Midday Dream ( see cut ) exemplified both . Courbet was a law student whose paintings of such big , authentically voluptuous women struck Parisians of the 1850s as " vulgar . "
