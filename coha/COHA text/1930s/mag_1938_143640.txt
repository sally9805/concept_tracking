In San Carlos , Nicaragua , on Feb. 23 , 1894 , according to U. S. Immigration records , French and German parents gave birth to one Jean Dee Jarnette , who was brought to California in 1910 , ran off to sea two years later . In 1923 , after Jean Dee Jarnette had roamed restlessly over Europe , Australia and the South Seas , he was convicted of rape and sent to California 's lone Reformatory . In 1931 , he was again convicted of rape and carrying concealed weapons , sent to San Quentin . There he confided to his cellmate an ambition that had slowly been forming in his mind , to get hold of a small boat , and " explore " the southern Pacific . <P> When middle-aged Jean Dee Jarnette was released last April , his first act was to take out duplicate seaman 's papers under the names of Jack Morgan and Wes S. Glenn . As Jack Morgan he shortly turned up in New Orleans , married a pretty 17-year-old laborer 's daughter named Lillian Casanova , took her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working as bellhop and chambermaid in hotels . <P> But Jack Morgan never forgot his ambition , was often observed prowling around yachts . Last month he had a singular stroke of luck . Living aboard his trim 58-ft. schooner yacht Aafje in San Pedro harbor was a lighthearted , thin-haired sportsman named Dwight L. Faulding . The owner of a Santa Barbara photo shop and hotel , Dwight Faulding was once rich and foolish enough to have bought a plane which he took up without a single flying lesson , crashed spang into a Santa Barbara street . <P> He and Jack Morgan became acquainted . Last fortnight impecunious Jack Morgan " chartered " the Aafje to take his pregnant wife on a cruise and Yachtsman Faulding took on two young men named Edward Spernak and Robert Home as crew . Glib Jack Morgan talked Los Angeles Nurse Elsie Berdan into joining the party to take care of his wife . Sportsman Faulding invited along one of his friends , stoutish Mrs. Gertrude Turner , who brought her 8-year-old son Robert . On the evening of December 20 the Aafje @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scudded silently out into the Pacific . <P> Nine days later a Navy plane , cruising south of its San Diego base , reported a small yacht wallowing in heavy seas , an SOS crudely painted on its torn mainsail . Out went Coast Guard amphibians and the cutter Perseus , which was soon chugging back the 180 miles to San Pedro with the Aafje in tow . The message also brought out a cutter with Special Agent W. H. Osborne of the Department of Justice on board . For the story the , six half-starved survivors of the Aafje had to tell involved , if not the piracy Jean Dee Jarnette had dreamed of , an example of the grave Federal crime of murder at sea . <P> The Aafje had been out of San Pedro but a few hours , according to the survivors ' stories , when Jack Morgan swaggered out to the wheel , began an argument with Dwight Faulding . When Morgan pulled a gun , Dwight Faulding ran for his . But Jack Morgan 's blazed first . " Then Jack , " his young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madman . " Taking command , he forced his frightened companions into their cabins , steered south . When Elsie Berdan protested Morgan 's advances , she got a clout on the head .
