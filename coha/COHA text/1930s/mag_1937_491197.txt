IF MINK MARRINER and Cap Huff had not visited me at Harvard College in June , 1759 , bearing a keg of rum and news from home , I might have graduated . , to face my family 's disapproval , That I had expected , but I was not prepared for Elizabeth , Browne 's lack of sympathetic understanding , which drove me to Stoodley 's Tavern . By midnight , I had carelessly talked my way into trouble again . and only the prompt and efficient aid of Hunk Marriner and Cap Huff saved me from immediate arrest . After a hasty farewell to the family , Hunk and I slipped out of town in the darkness . Dawn found us puddling up the Piscataqua on the long trail to the headquarters of Lord Jeffrey Amherst 's army at Crown Point , where it faced the French and Indians in the northern wilderness . In the Flintlock Tavern at Dunbarton we were fortunate in falling in with salty Sergeant McNutt , of Rogers ' Rangers , that fumed hard-bitten body of scouts and woodsmen serving under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , due to his efforts , Major Rogers enrolled us in his command . I had thought that . the season for campaigning was over , but was quickly disillusioned . Rogers ' plans were made . Night would find us on our way to attack St. Francis near the St. Lawrence , far off in the heart of the enemy country . III ALL the rest of that day , the camp remained as we n. had first seen it .. Not a tent was struck . Not a boat was launched , except temporarily , to hunt for leaks . The sun swung into the southwest and slid down behind the mountains of the New York shore , leaving them masses of purple against an orange sky . A chill September wind swept across the flat surface of Crown Point , ruffling the waters to the north and darkening them to a steely drab , but still the Rangers dawdled about their tents , laboring at tasks that might have occupied them on any ordinary day . One who spied upon them from the heights on either side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before each row of tents , as the twilight grew , a generous fire brightened the dingy canvas , so that the tent fronts gleamed whitely in the glow , like beacons of their owners ' innocent pursuits and peaceful intent . The orange sky softened to a rosy yellow ; dimmed slowly to a pallid green . The mountains bulked black against the fading light , and as the stars began to appear above them , the lake darkened until there was no telling where water ended and shore began . Then , between the tents and the beach , there was unseen movement , and faint noises were heard  --  the sound of wood rubbing against wood , of low-pitched voices , of eplashings . More than ever , the row of tents seemed erected upon a stage : for before each fire , throwing its light against the canvas , a movable palisade of brush had been set in place , screening the flames from the lake . Thus , although the tents were illuminated as by a row of giant footliehts , the boats and those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the placing of the screens , Hunk and following McNott 's instructions , left the shelter of a tent and entered the darkness near the water , we found that narrow space thronged with men  --  men who multiplied and grew thick about , us , as though they rose noiselessly from out of the ground . We could hear sergeants monotonously muttering the numbers of their boats ; " Seven , seven , seven , seven . " . . " Three , three , three ! " Hunk left me . I worked to the eastward along the shingle , through milling men who growled and murmured until I heard , hoarsely reiterated , the words : " One , one , one , one . " No . I was the whaleboat to which Rogers had assigned me . Three officers stood close by the beached stern of No. 1 . I recognized the tight-fitting cap of Major Rogers . " Get in , " he told me . A sergeant , clutching the stern , asked my name . When I told him , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vague figures in the darkness , already occupied the outer ends of the third thwart . Each held an upended oar . Others climbed in and stumbled between us , walking on our feet and rapping musket butts against us , and the boat seemed to float in an aroma of greasy buckskin , sweat , gun oil and damp wool . From where I sat , shivering , I looked hack at the shining tents and at black shadows passing swiftly between us and the fire screens . I heard one of the shadows report , " No. 15 filled and ready , " Close on the words , another muttered , " No. 12 filled and ready . " Rogers asked amiably about No. 17 . " Anybody dead in No. 17 ? Maybe they are n't going . " A whisper went down the beach like a shadow dying in a thicket . A breathless voice said , " No. 17 filled and ready . " " Send ' em off ! " Rogers ordered . Up the beach I heard gratings , thumpings and the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stern of No. 1 , and in the faint light I recognized Captain Ogden . Dimly I saw the boat beside us slide slowly away from land . Its oars creaked and dipped softly as it moved beyond my line of vision . " Push out ! " Rogers said . The boat stirred beneath us. rumbling on the pebbly bottom , then floated clear . Rogers and two others  --  one of them the sergeant  --  climbed in over the stern . The sergeant picked up u steering oar and pushed , while the men beside me set their oars softly in the gunwales and pulled . We moved out to find the other whaleboats drifting as silently as dark shadows , and as we passed them one by one , a voice from each identified it . " No. 17 , " the first boat said ; and in reply , Rogers ' thick yoke called , " Buttonmould Bay . " They lay there in a long line , sixteen of them , seeming to wait avidly for this word that Rogers flung at them . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north , the oars creaking . Behind us , against the dim radiance of the tents we had left , I could see the oars of the other whaleboats moving rhythmically in our wake , like the legs of a gigantic centipede . Faintly I could see the bulky figure of Major Rogers leaning over the stern of the boat , unshipping the rudder from its slings , hanging it in place on the sternpost ; and I thought that I could feel an emanation from him  --  a sort of warmth , as from a hidden flame . It seems to me now that if I could make others feel that warmth , which forced us on and on , and ever on , when all hope of going onward had long died within us , it is possible that they might in the end have a clearer understanding of that singular indomitable figure , in whose brain was stored a , fund of knowledge possessed by no other living man . If I could convey to others his astounding fortitude , which held us up and held us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand , it is possible that even his harshest contemners might be more lenient in their judgment of him . The boat moved slowly , with a small , uneasy rocking . From the waters of the lake rose a cold dampness and a brackish smell , unlike the clean salt freshness of the PiscaMoua . This reflection turned my mind to Elizabeth . Wait , I thought  --  wait till she saw me with my green Ranger 's blanket fastened at my shoulder with a silver brooch ; my Scotch cap cocked rakishly toward my right eyebrow , as Rangers wore them ! Would she weep because once she had been hard to me ; had scorned me ? She had n't understood me when I wished to be a painter , but when I came home a hero  --  ah , she 'd understand that ! She had despised me for associating with improper persons ? " Vulgar creatures " ? and , wondering what she 'd think if she could see some of the persons I was associating with now , I laughed bitterly  --  and , unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oar made a clucking noise . For laughers that got to laugh out loud , " he whispered hoarsely , " they 're hereby granted leave to swim under water till they get to shore , where they can laugh like hell while getting unboweled with a hatchet . " I sat rigid and thanked my stars for the darkness . Behind me , the boat was silent , save for the cautious slight splash or oars . Before me , on the stern thwarts , Rogers , Ogden and the third officer huddled together , whispering . The darkness of this brackish lake was the close , clammy darkness of a warehouse in winter . The slow , monotonous beat of oars became , in my sleepy mind , a sort of threnody to whose tune we moved inexorably , a dark procession , toward a distant open grave . Hours , it seemed to me , elapsed before the sergeant . at the tiller hoarsely whispered , " Oars ? " The man at my left pulled at my arm and slid toward me . It was my turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and got . my hands on the handle of the clumsy sweep . Even the steersman was relieved , and by Rogers himself . Every half hour there was a similar shifting of oarsmen on every thwart . To me , the strangest thing about this stealthy parade of boats was the silence of the . rowers . Never before had I been for hours in the company of men who were entirely silent . I thought I understood why Rogers ' Rangers had the reputation of doing wild and outlandish things when not on military service . If they were thus bottled up for nights and days on end , it seemed to me , they must indeed he on the verge of bursting when restraint was at length removed . Rumor , no doubt , was right when it credited them with drinking powerful liquors in prodigious quantities , and seeking the society of women who were wild and gay . Toward morning we moved more slowly . We were close inshore  --  so close that we could see pointed spruces against the faintly luminous sky ; hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood in the stern , sniffing the air ; he really seemed to smell his way . Without lights or landmarks to guide him , he called back to No. 2 boat , " Turn in here . Pass the word . " We headed for the loom of the land . Beneath our bows there was the scrunching of a. sandy beach , and we heard the other boats slide ashore , one by one . In a thick whisper , Rogers gave his orders for posting sentries  --  six men to the north beyond the headland ; six over the ridge in front of the boats ; six to the flat land to the south . lie spoke as though the shore were distinct before him in the rays of an afternoon sun , instead of a black mass from which emerged the soft scent of pines and dying grasses . He spoke , too , as though an unseen enemy might be lurking close at hand , waiting to hatchet the lot of us in ease so much as one precaution should be overlooked . When dawn came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screened beneath bushes . Their crews were camped on the high land above , far enough back among the spruces to be invisible from the lake . I say theywere camped , but it was a poor apology for a camp . There were no tents , no fires , no kettles , no hot food . We had been told to build no fires till we knew ourselves to be free from French and Indians , and this warning needed no repetition . The boat crews had orders to stay together , so , in reality , there were seventeen small camps grouped about the knoll . The men could go only to the latrines or to a spring for water , so they sat quietly , blankets around them , waiting for rations to be distributed . Thus they were not only under the surveillance of the sergeants who camped with them , but of their lieutenants , who occupied posts on higher ground , and of Rogers himself , who had arranged his captains and his belongings on the summit of the knoll . It seemed to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the crew of No. 1 whaleboat were flesh and blood instead of dim shadows that growled and muttered , that I had never seen men who looked less companionable . They ignored me ; and I , unwilling to thrust myself upon them , thought gloomily that if it ever came to fighting , I would be unfortunateindeed withsuch comrades . There were twelve of us , aside from Rogers , Ogden Williams and the sergeant , and I studied them when the opportunity offered . Oursergeant'sname was Bradley . His face was pale and a little bitter , and he was given to standing stock-still and staring accusingly from one to the other of us , as if he expected to catch us in something underhanded . There were two corporals  --  Webster , a mournful-looking man , and little Crofton , who seemed perpetually suspicious . One of our crew was a jet-black Negro , about whom there was something vaguely familiar , though I had seen so few Negroes that they all looked alike to me . He carried his head a little forward , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking . he half laughed , as if he found the world and everyone in it irresistibly amusing . He was called Pomp by some and Whip by others . The Ranger beside me  --  Jesse Beacham  --  was old and stooped . His hair was almost white , and the calm detachment of his face put . me in mind of a setter dog sitting sleepily in the sun with upraised head , enduring the attentions of obstreperous children . Feeling heavy-hearted and homesick , I got to my feet and stared around , hopeful of seeing Hunk or AleNott , but I could find no familiar face among the scores of green-clad figures who sat or lay among the fallen logs and mossy rocks that were thick on the knoll . In the early morning light that filtered down through the tall trees around us , those dim fissures seemed unreal , and I felt cold , lonely and miserable . Mosquitoes by the thousand whined around my face and ears . Infinitesimal insects  --  no-see-'emspierced my hands and neck as with red-hot needles . I sat down again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space like a benevolent white hound . " Do n't they bite you ? " I asked . He said simply , that they did n't , and the tone in which he said it was courteous , but seemingly final . You got something on you so they do n't bite ? " I asked . He said " Yes , " in the same courteous tone . Soon afterward I discovered that Jesse seldom said more than " Yes " or " No " until he had , in his own mind , satisfactorily phrased a more extended reply . He liked to be exact in what he said  --  an excellent trait , but one that can be carried to excess . Not knowing Jesse 's peculiarities , I was thoroughly discouraged and wished I 'd never been such a fool as to become a part of an army . Although none of the men about me had appeared to be aware of me , I found that most of them had heard what I 'd just said . Crofton , on his knees sort ing out rations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your woolen string , grampa , " he said . " Tell him how the mosquitoes ca n't bite while you got on your woolen strings . " Jesse stared mournfully into space . " The woolen strings ai n't for insects . " One of the Rangers rose on his elbow . " Of course they ai n't for insects ! The woolen strings keep off toothache . The thing that keeps off the insects is two acorns a day , eaten raw , ai n't it , g-rampa ? " " No , " Jesse said . " No . The woolen strings do n't have no virtue for toothache . " Sergeant Bradley came quickly among us , stared bitterly around him , then began to distribute biscuit and a bologna sausage apiece . Webster followed him sadly , pouring rum into our horn cups . As each man received his ration , he glanced up at Webster with it sort of furtive curiosity . When Bradley reached me , he spoke defiantly : " In dry weather Jesse rubs soap on himself . He hates to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has for soap . In wet weather he greases like an Indian . " In a milder voice , he spoke to Jesse : " Ai n't that what you do , grampa ? " " Yes , " Jesse said , caressing his knuckles . Bradley snorted and walked away ; and Webster , having filled our cups , went on in silence . his face contemplative . I was surprised when Jesse looked solicitously after him : then the old man 's eyes met mine , and he cleared his throat : " Webster got a letter yesterday . His wife just died , and he do n't feel good . " " That 's too bad . " Jesse nodded . " Yes ; I spose a man gets interested in a woman after living with her a few years . " The jet-black Negro , Whip , got up , same and stood beside me , and without a word held out an old brass snuff box . " What 's this ? " I asked . The box , he explained , eontained hear 's grease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mosquitoes and no-see-'ems would be less troublesome , since they disliked getting their feet greasy . I thanked Whip and rubbed some of it on my face and neck . While I did so . Whip said : " Ai n't you remember me ? I 'm one of the Braveboat Harbor Whipples . I 'm Pomp Whipple . " Brave-boat Harbor was a section of Kittery to he eastward of my home . " Then you must be one of Captain Whipple 's boys , " I said ? " one of the boys he brought from Africa ! " Capt . William Whipple was a highly respected resident of our section who had made a fortune out of sailing a slave ship before he was thirty years old . Pomp nodded . He 'd often seen me around Kittery , he told me , when he was younger  --  before he ran away and joined the Indians . Crofton leaned forward to wag the uneaten portion of his sausage at me . " Kittery ? You do n't talk like you come from Kittery . I come from Epping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englishman , the way you do ? " I said I was n't conscious of talking like an Englishman . Sergeant Bradley came over to stare , with what seemed his customary bitterness , at Crofton . " You fellers up in Epping , " he complained , " think anybody talks foreign if he do n't sound as if he had a mouse up his nose . " He turned his attention to me . " Funny I never see you before . I was horn and brought up in Portsmouth . " I confessed I had been away at college . " College ! " the sergeant said incredulously . " What college ? " When I said Harvard , he uttered an exclamation of comprehension . " Harvard ! No wonder you do n't sound right to Crofton ! The most educated person Crofton ever heard talk was somebody up in Epping that was thinking about studying common fractious . " He eyed me speculatively . " What would you want to join the Rangers for , if you got a good home and book learning to boot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I joined on account of a man you probably know , seeing you 're a native of Portsmouth . " The sergeant looked interested . " Is that so ? Who would that be ? " " Wyseman Clagett . " The sergeant 's face was blank . Elderly , white-haired Jesse Beacham turned mournful eyes on me , and Pomp Whipple laughed nervously . " Well , well ! " Bradley said . " i never expected to see a friend of Wyse-man Clagett in the Rangers . " " I 'm not exactly-his friend , " I said . I told him how , in a private room in Stoodley 's Tavern , I had unwittingly insulted Clagett and Sheriff Parker , and been helped to escape by the intervention of Cap Huff and Hunk Mar-rimer . My boat mates gathered around and listened , and Pomp Whipple , rolling his eyes , chuckled delightedly at inopportune moments . Bradley ruminatively sucked a pine splinter , and when I had finished , he said carelessly , " When you go home , some of us better go along , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take his house to pieces , just to give him the idea . " From the others arose a muttering of assent .. All at once it seemed to me I had never seen a kindlier or pleasanter-looking set of men . It struck me as incredible that I could have thought them churlish , and I was glad my lot had been east with such intelligent and sympathetic companions . A distant hoarse voice shouted for Sergeant Bradley . My new-found friend left me , running . When he came back , he addressed me brusquely : " Towne , Major wants you . " Rogers , when I had first seen him on the preceding day , had impressed me , bemuse of his thick lips , his long , fleshy nose and the puffy circles beneath his eyes , as one of the ugliest of men . Now I found nothing ugly about him , and was chiefly concerned with his intense and violent energy of mind and body . lie was forever on the move  --  prowling among his men and staring at them , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tall pine speculatively ; squinting at distant landmarks ; kicking at the soil underfoot as if to judge its quality ; walking in circles and moving his heavy lips with the air of studying some bothersome problem ; casting quick and rather furti VC glances at the faces of those near him . When I came up the knoll , he was walking in circles around a lofty spruce , at the base of which sat Captain Ogden and handsome , yellow-haired Captain Williams , of the Royal Regiment ; and scattered here and there were other officers , rolled in their blankets , their heads on knapsacks . The sun had just topped the rise behind us . From the knoll , the lake , half shrouded in early morning mist , looked milky . Rogers peered into that pale expanse ; then stared upward and whistled sharply . " See anything ? " A guttural " No ! " emerged from the treetop . I looked up and saw Konkapot wedged against the trunk . Rogers went to his knapsack and fumbled in it . He drew out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I want you to write down the names of men I send out , and where I send ' em , and when they get back  --  if they do get back . Put down the places we stop and what the weather 's like . I want to keep a map of this trip . This place is Button-mould Bay . Tonight I figure on getting beyond Otter River  --  maybe as far as Split Rock . " " Split Rock ? " Captain Williams asked . His voice was polite . Rogers nodded . " You know how these Frenchmen are , captain . They pop right up out of the water when I 'm around . You 'd think they were frogs ! Yes , Indians do it too . " He laughed . " Seems to be something about . me that kind of attracts ' em . Yet , on the other hand , they do n't much like me . Anyway , we 'll take it slow and dodge ' em . You 'll see what I mean when this fog burns off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rogers , and he looked up inquiringly . Konkapot 's mournful voice said , " Six men in canoe . " We stared between the tree trunks at the New York shore , dimly seen through the lifting fog , but snw nothing . A sentry ran through the heavy underbrush and up to the knoll to Rogers . " Two canoes and a bateau , " he said . " There 's a canoe scouting each shore , and the bateau 's keeping out in the middle . It 's full of Frenchmen . ? Fifteen Frenchmen . Six Indians in each canoe . " " How close are the canoes ? " Rogers asked . " About pistol shot offshore at the headlands . " " All right , " Rogers said . " Tell Captain Jacobs I want him . I 'll use his Indians and the Mohawks too . " Captain Jacobs was captain of the Stockbridge Indians , and he was a nightmare . His upper body was painted black ; the lower part of his face white . On his chest was neatly depicted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gorget . His head was shaved ; the base of his scalp lock was wrapped tightly , to the height of five inches , with a rattlesnake skin . Thus the top of his scalp lock sprayed out above the snakeskin like a ragged shaving brush . Among the hairs of the scalp lock were bound the rattles of several rattlesnakes . Rogers was more military with this Indian officer than with any of his white officers . They saluted each other punctiliously , and Rogers not only addressed Jacobs as " Captain , " but also as " Brother Nawnawampeteoonk , " which was his real name ; Jacobs being his Christian or civilized name . All the Stockbridge Indians , Rogers told him , were to follow the canoes and bateau , and report their movements . The Mohawks were to scout north toward Otter River in an attempt to find - ( Continued front Pair . 34 ) out where the party of French and Indians had been camped the night before . These orders given , Rogers pulled at his lower lip , rolling his protuberant eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocently empty of enemies . He beckoned to Captain Ogden . " Take twenty men , " he told him , " and post ' em in the brush above our boats . If that scout canoe gets sight of any of our boats and comes in to investigate , let it get close up and then destroy every man in it . Do n't let any of ' em get away . Finish ' em all . If they do n't set our boats , let ' em go by . " Ogden summoned Sergeant Bradley , and Bradley walked around the knoll , calling off names : Beacham , Foyle , Orford , Bennett , Rice , McRae , Murphy , Thacher . I saw them moving cautiously toward the boats ; saw Ogden pointing out the positions they should take . Rogers turned to his other officers , who had folded their blankets and picked up their packs and muskets . " Join your detachments . Stay with ' em till we find out where these scout boats are bound . Tell your men to get what sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till everything 's clear . " Instantly they hurried away , leaving the knoll deserted , except for Rogers and me . The Stockbridge Indians , stripped to leggings and breechclouts , came over the shoulder of the knoll and stood looking out over the mina blue lake . It seemed to me that the black and white paint on their upper bodies had the effect of making them look more like shadows than men . A man 's body sometimes seemed to terminate at the white paint , so that one needed to hunt carefully in order to find his complete outline . Fascinated , I began sketching them as they stood there , but stopped when one of the Indians pointed at something on the water and another made a grunting noise . Turning my head , I saw that a canoe had slid into sight from behind the headland . " There they are , " Rogers said . It was n't one of the big canoes , called " canals du maitre , " but the next smaller size , known as a half canoe . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and four who were doing the paddling . All six shone in the early-morning sun as if lacquered . Their faces were painted green and yellow ; their bodies black and red . When the canoe swung into the bay on a long curve , about fifty yards from ? shore , we could see the shaved heads of the bowman and steersman moving slowly from side to side ; see them lift their eyes , white in their painted faces , to the treetops  --  hunting , no doubt , for signs of smoke . I looked for the Stockbridge Indians , to see what they thought of these strangers , but they had vanished , and the knoll where they had stood seemed to lack all human life . There was no movement on it , no sound . Even the groups below me had melted away . Wrapped in their green blankets , the Rangers looked like moss-covered logs or boulders . The canoe slid around the bay . Far out in mid-lake , a bateau slowly held a straight course toward Crown Point . The oarsmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in white uniforms  --  French officers . These were the first French soldiers I had ever seen , and in the distance , on the bosom of that placid lake , they looked like painted little toy soldiers for children to play with . I could n't feel that they were dangerous , or deadly enemies , or that they , and others like them , had fought our colonists for five long years ; had sent Indians by thousands against our settlements ; had allowed Indians to butcher women and children and unarmed colonists two years ago at Fort William Henry ; had slaughtered thousands of our men a year ago at Ticonderoga . When the bateau and canoes had vanished beyond the southern headland of Buttonmould Bay , the knoll was suddenly busy again . They had n't seen our whaleboats , and the camp was at ease once more . Men puttered with knapsacks and muskets ; entered into involved and endless arguments ; spread blankets on the ground and played at five-card loo with a deal of finger wetting and slapping down of cards ; slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to have , from Rogers ' remarks to me , a clearer understanding of the Rangers and of the men who made up that body . Most of them , both officers and men , had enlisted as Rangers and were nothing but Rangers at any time . A fair number , however , were temporarily attached to the Rangers because they were officers or men from other parts of General Amherst 's army who seemed well equipped to become skilled in the type of marching and fighting for which Rogers was famous . The Stockbridge Indians , too , were Rangers , but the Mohawks were not . The Mohawks had been sent to General Amherst by Sir William - Johnson , who lived in the Mohawk Valley and was the Superintendent of Northern Indians for the British Government ; and the general , having no other use for them , had ordered them to accompany Major Rogers as scouts . From the major 's tone when he spoke of them , I gathered he was not enthusiastic about Mohawks . Every moment Rogers was more of a marvel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continually he prowled around the camp , examining boats , talking with sentries , scrutinizing the lake ; even stopping to watch the progress of card games . I was always surprised to see the small distinction he made between officers and men . He stood over a group rolling dice on a blanket , and took part in it by throwing down a shilling . The shilling became two , then four . The men were familiar with him , daring him to let it stay . He took up his shillings , however , and prowled away , abusing them good-naturedly ; telling them they knew nothing about the game , at which they guffawed . Even though I was new to the army , I had lived near a British garrison and knew that a British officer would rather be dead than to put himself on an equality with his men like this . It was noon before I could sleep myself , for Rogers kept me with him , even though he must have seen I found trouble in staying awake . When at length he let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours had passed since , leg-weary from my long march with Hunk , I had looked for the first time on Crown Point and the army , for I had begun to feel that I had been in the army all my life and had never rested . The night we left Buttonmould Bay we rowed a bare ton miles to Otter River ; but short as the journey was , it was long enough to rob me of my only friends , and to come within an inch of putting an end to the expedition . It was long enough , too , to give me a. respect for Rogers that endured . Toward sundown , the Mohawks had returned from the northward with the news that they had found no signs of a place where the bateau-load of Frenchmen might have camped . Rogers listened without comment to the report of their spokesman , but he was far from satisfied . " Those Frenchmen camped somewhere ! " he complained to Williams . " If I 'd been in their place , I 'd have camped at Otter River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the proper time for ' em to get here if they 'd started from Otter River at daybreak . I know damned well they did n't row all night ! I wonder if those Mohawks just went far enough from , camp to lie down and take a good comfortable sleep themselves ! I never liked anything Sir William Johnson had a hand in , and it was be who sent those Mohawks to General Amherst ! " Captain . Jacobs and his Stockbridge Indians came back at dusk and reported that the French in the bateau and the Indians in the two canoes had gone to a headland from which they had an unobstructed view south to Crown Point , and camped there . Rogers looked thoughtful and shook his head , but gave orders for the whaleboats to be uncovered and launched , and for the oars to be wrapped with strips of blanketing . When the men were aboard lie went from boat to boat , warning the crews to be silent . Under no condition , he told them , were they to talk . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the signal to stop rowing ; given once , the signal to go ahead . The night . was cold  --  so cold that my neck ached and my muscles seemed made of wood . A heavy mist hung low over the water , thrusting clammy lingers against our flesh and through our garments . Rogers , a towering figure in the stern of our boat , thrust his beak of a nose into the air currents , seeming to feel them as an animal might . From time to time , startlingly , the vacant , hysterical laugh of a loon burst from his lips , and we lay drifting silently , rocking a little on the black water : then , in the profound stillness of that cold night , we could hear him sniffing and whuffling like a suspicious bear . Four miles of rowing brought us to the shallows that lie off the mouth of Otter River , and it . was here that his sniffing was rewarded . He had stopped us with that singularly vacant burst of laughter , and so lung did he hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vibrated with our shivering . Not a sound could we hear save the faint chirping of small birds , far overhead , moving south ; yet Rogers , apparently , was aware of something . We could feel him lean from side to side ; hear him sniff as a questing dog sniffs , blowing outward as if to freshen his organs of scent , then drawing the air jerkily in to his nostrils . Of course , it could n't actually have been altogether smell ; he had some sort of sixth sense that the rest of us lacked . Just when I thought our waiting would never end , a faint but unmistakable sound came out of the mist dead ahead  --  a sound that I had heard n thousand times on the Portsmouth docks , when brigs and schooners stirred uneasily at the thrust of a rising tide . It was the muted streaking of the jaws of a boom , working against a mast . Rogers sank down in the stern of the boat . " Frenchman anchored off the 38 THE SATURDAY mouth of the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We can row around it , " Williams breathed , " No telling how many vessels there are , " Rogers said softly . " We got to get past ' ern , and there 's only one sure way . We 'll have to go where they ca n't go . " Obeying his whispered orders , the seventeen whaleboats silently floated backward , like the ghost of some strange lake monster ; then nosed off to the eastward , into a bay so shallow that Our oar blades scraped bottom  --  so shallow that long before the boats had reached the shore , we had climbed overboard to drag them through the mud and the clustered water plants . t seemed more like a dream than a reality that two hundred men and all those boats should move across that mud puddle of a bay without a shout , without . a curse , without the splashing of water . or the thump of a dropped oar against a thwart , or the rumble of one boat colliding with another . That was how they moved , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low-lying hank from which mosquitoes rose by the million to devour us . We covered ourselves as well as we could from the bloodthirsty insects , nd when the dawn came , . we went to work carrying the boats . Otter River has a peculiar mouth . In the centuries during which it has poured its brown flood down from the sharp hills to the eastward of C'hamplain , it has brought with it so much soil that it has built for itself a narrow spit of land , projecting a mile into the lake . This spit of land has made two bays out of the one into which it extends , and along the spit runs the river . A sketch of the hay and the river mouth , therefore , would resemble the distended jaws of a gigantic animal thrusting out an eager tongue , as if wishful of gulping down the succulent little island that lies a mere three-quarters of a mile away . Above the tongue is North Otter Bay , which is deep ; below it is South Otter Bay , so shoal as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a canoe . It was through the shallows of South titter Bay that we dragged our boats ashore on the tongue of land along which the river pours itself into the lake , and it was across this tongue of land that we were obliged to carry the boats to get to the north of the French . After an hour of hack-breaking labor , steaming with sweat , tip to our middles in water , almost eaten alive by mosquitoes , we finally brought the boats to the edge of North Otter Bay and covered them with brush at the foot of the wooded hill that lies to the north of the river mouth . There we lay , simmering an.d fuming , while Rogers set off for the top of the hill with Lieutenant Turner and Ensign Avery to obtain additional information about the French . I say that we simmered and fumed , but those words are inadequate to express the current of rage against the Mohawks that ran through the camp as flame runs through dry grass . The heat , perhaps , had set our nerves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made our auger keener . Whatever the reason , the whole camp was fuming over the Mohawks ; and when Rogers came back , bringing word that there had been and still were three French sloops ranged between the river mouth and Diamond Island , the language used to describe Sir William Johnson 's Indians became Biblical . EVENING POST Every man in the detachment knew that the Mohawks had been sent on a scout . toward Otter River on the preceding day . These French sloops , almost necessarily , had been anchored in this same spot during the entire time the Mohawks were on their scout , for the occupants of the bateau and two canoes that had passed us must have been sent out . from these very vessels . The failure of the Mohawks to bring back word of the three French craft had endangered the whole expedition . Lacking a leader as astute as Rogers , we would probably have been discovered if there had been only one French sloop . With three of them lying across the channel , our escape was miraculous . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , calling them murdering red hellions , dirty red skunks , and names unfit to repeat ; and only the Mohawks themselves seemed unconscious of the temper of the detachment . They sat at the water 's edge , looking like thirteen skinned foxes , and complacently daubed vermilion bands across countenances previously blackened with soot ; and those who had business in their vicinity sheered away from them as though they were vipers . Rogers prowled restlessly nt the foot of the hill , making sure that the boats were properly concealed , and issuing orders for the picketing of the camp . My brief experience of the day before had taught me how to stick close to his left elbow , ready to note down his orders , and at the same time keep out from underfoot . He paraded Turner 's and Avery 's detachments and the Stockbridge Indians , My equipped ; then sent them off to join Avery and Turner on the slope of the hill overlooking the river mouth , where they had been left to watch the sloops . He kept Captain Jacobs with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lieutenant of the Stockbridge Indians , that he and Jacobs would also come to watch the sloops as soon as the camp was in order . Then , followed by Jacobs and me , he went to the northern slope of the hill , where the whaleboat crews had settled themselves : and there , beside a tall spruce , he halted . " Now , " Rogers said to Jacobs , " tell those Mohawks I want to see ' em . Their hash is all loose in ' em ; we 'll have to settle it . " There were thirteen of the Mohawks , and when they stood before Rogers , staring at him out of eyes as dull and black us the soot on their faces , it seemed to me they looked more like snakes than like humans . Their heads were flatter than those of the Stockbridge Indians , and that flatness was accentuated by the scalp locks which lay against their shaved and blackened skulls . From ear to ear , across their eyes and the bridges of their noses , they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stripes upon serpents . All of them wore their blankets fastened around their waists and hanging clown in folds , and above those folds their thin , soot-daubed upper bodies rose lithe and tense . Unquestionably , the thirteen were contemptuous , defiant and dangerous . Rogers stared at them ; then glanced around the knoll  --  at the officers on either side of him ; at the groups of Rangers chewing busily at their morning rations , their faces turned toward the little knot of painted Mohawks . It was a smolderingly silent audience JartuarY 9.1 ? 737 that the commander had when he began to speak , " Our brothers , the Mohawks , " he said , and his thick voice was almost kindly , " are known to all the world as great warriors . They have come a long journey from their homes in the Mohawk Valley , and we , their friends , understood they had come to raise their hatchets in behalf of the great king , their father . Because they are known to be terrible in war , the great king , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Amherst , gave orders that they should go with me to act as my eyes and ears against our enemies , the French . Yesterday , knowing that the Mohawks were skilled in tracking enemies , we sent them to Otter River to discover the camping ground of the French . Since they made no complaints , we supposed that they went willingly , and would faithfully carry out their orders . There were three vessels at Otter River , yet our brothers the Mohawks failed to see those vessels . They returned , saying they found nothing . We trusted them , and because we trusted them , all of us have this morning been in danger of losing our boats and our lives . How do our brothers , the Mohawks , explain their blindness ? " The spokesman of the Mohawks replied as gravely and with as noble a bearing as though he gave utterance to the most rational and sagacious sentiments . " Sir William Johnson , " he said , " allows his children , the Mohawks , to do what they will . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them whether it would give them pleasure to go ; and unless the Mohawks are agreed that it would give them pleasure , they do not go . At Crown Point it is different , and here it is also different . We are told to do the thing that one man wishes us to do , regardless of our own desires . We do not like to be ruled as any man may choose to order us . When we were told yesterday to go on a scout to Otter River , we went a short distance and then held a council to decide whether we wished to go further . Some were willing , but others were not . Each man made an oration , and when all had spoken , more were in favor of returning than of going forward . Therefore , we returned . " I know now that Indians are peculiar people and can not be judged as white men are judged . I have learned that some of them are so direct and honest in their manner of thinking that they are as wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but most of them are simple to absurdity  --  so simple that they can only be depended on to do the wrong thing : To waste food when it should be saved ; to rely on dreams when reason is essential ; to be reckless when caution is advisable and cautious when recklessness is the prime essential ; to lie when truthfulness is required , and tell the truth when tactful evasion is demanded ; to run home when they are most needed , and get underfoot when they are least wanted ; to punish harmless transgressions with death and ignore the most heinous crimes . In those days , however , I knew nothing about Indians , and the Mohawks seemed to me to be treacherous , and as dangerous to us as mad dogs . Shooting , I thought , was far too good a death for them , Rogers had different ideas , and his reply was as gentle in its manner as though he were praising the Mohawks for faithful service . " We are grateful to our brothers , the Mohawks , for explaining to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are grateful to them , also , for coming such a long journey to show their friendship . We need their help , and we hope they will always he our friends . We also hope that someday they will learn our method of making war , as have our brothers from Stockbridge . Our brothers say that Sir William Johnson allows them to do what they will , but if our brothers should only do what they wanted to do in this section of the country  --  if , when they were put on guard , they should prefer to wrap themselves in their blankets and sleep  --  they would soon lose their scalps . What is worse , those whom they were supposed to guard would also lose their scalps . " We have discovered that this is not a good way to make war . It is impossible to make war if you are dead , and the only way to stay alive when lighting the French is for wise men to give orders beforehand as to what must be done ; then for everybody to obey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . That is why , in our army , soldiers are shot when they do not obey orders  --  when they decide to do as they will . " Since our brothers , the Mohawks , are accustomed to disobey orders if they find those orders displeasing , they should be careful to serve only under Sir William Johnson . If they serve under anyone else , they will probably be shot . Since the Mohawks are our friends , I do not wish to hurt their feelings or the feelings of Sir William Johnson by shooting any of them . Neither am I willing to keep them with us any longer , for they will only eat our provisions and drink our rum and refuse to obey orders . Therefore , they must go back to Crown Point . But if they should tell the truth as to why they went back , General Amherst might have them shot , so they must say they became sick . It may seem remarkable that all the Mohawks on this expedition should become sick together , all at one time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , but it is better to be called old women than to be shot . " He leaned casually upon a musket and waited for Captain Jacobs to translate . The Mohawks , seemingly indifferent to Jacobs ' words , stared straight ahead out of lackluster eyes . " They 're to go at once , " Rogers said , when Jacobs had finished . " We need their boat , so they 're to go by land . Have ' em get their belongings from their boat and set off immediately . " He turned to Captain Williams . " You 're in command , captain , until I come back . I 'll have to find out what those sloops are doing . " One of the fundamental differences , it seems to me , between Indians and white men who are known as civilized is that the white man has been more or less disciplined , whereas Indians , as a rule , are free of disciplinary measures from their earliest days . Indian children are never whipped for wrongdoing ; drunken Indians are held guiltless of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tribe or nation to do anything he does n't want to do ; lazy Indians are supported by more industrious ones . Because of that lack of discipline , Indians are supposed to be more savage , cruel , treacherous , cowardly , shortsighted than any other race . Yet I doubt that an Indian at his worst can outdo white men who , because of panic , mob excitement or leek of leadership , have temporarily broken away from the discipline that is supposed to be the white man 's birthright , The Mohawks went quietly enough to their boat when Rogers and Jacobs were out of sight , and all over the knoll Rangers rose to their feet to see them go ; and never before had I heard profanity to equal that which accompanied them . On rejoining the crew of No. 1 whaleboat to devour my delayed breakfast , I found even Jesse Beacham gazing mournfully after the red men and mildly repeating the words " drammed red bustards . " Sergeant McNott , purple-faced with rage , stared belligerently about him , as if for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside me . " Ai n't it a shame , " he said , " that Indians do n't have pelts half as good as a weasel , so they 'd he worth shooting ? " MeNott violently urged me to write down in my hook , where Rogers wotild see it , that it would pay the British government not to make presents to Mohawks except those who had kept farthest away during three consecutive campaigns . Indeed I was conscious myself of a sort of suffocating resentment at those dreadful Indians , who would have sacrificed all of us to their own senseless stupidity ; and so hot was this resentment that it seemed to me I would have had as little hesitation in killing a Mohawk as in shooting a porcupine that had filled my dog 's mouth and tongue with quills . Someone shouted near the river bank , where the boats were hidden in the brush , bat so engrossing was my anger that the sound made no impression on me . I forgot noise had been forbidden  --  forgot , that is , until MeNott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the direction of the shout . Captain Williams ran down from the knoll , and there was sudden and unaccustomed movement in all the groups . Hunk scrambled back to his detachment , seized his musket and snapped up the pan . All around me , I saw , men were picking up their muskets and getting to their knees , peering toward the boats . Out from the brush in which the boats had been hidden stumbled one of the Mohawks , and close behind was Captain Butterfield , a provincial officer from New Hampshire . Butterfield , burly and red-faced at all times , looked even redder now . He was clutching at the Indian 's greasy shoulder , and the Indian , encumbered by a musket , his pack and a bulky powder bag , staggered , but was not stopped . Captain Williams went past the Mohawk on the run , caught Butter-field 's outstretched arm and swung him abruptly to a halt . The whole knoll boiled with men in green buckskins . A phalanx of them seemed to spring from the ground behind Williams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found myself in the front row of this formation , with Flunk and MeNott crowded close against me . The Indian , halted by the wall of men , turned and would have gone buck past Williams and Butterfield toward the boats , but Butterfield thrust out his foot and tripped him . " You ca n't do that , captain ! " Williams cried . The Indian had bounced to his feet like an enormous red squirrel , his eyes darting hero and there as if seeking a hole through which he might scramble , but Rangers had run between him and the boats ; he was penned in a ring of men with Williams and Butterfield . " Ca n't ! " Butterfield cried . " Ca n't ! Why ca n't I ? Those red skunks stole the powder and the rum out of the 40 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST , January 9 , 1937 boat ! It ai n't theirs ; it 's ours ! They ca n't wreck us and rob us , too  --  not without learning a lesson ! I caught this one and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circle of men came angry words : " Blow his head off ! " " Stick a knife in him ! " " Where 'd the rest of ' em go ? " Williams asked . " Upriver , " Butterfield said angrily . " They got away , but this one wo n't ! " " Lieutenant Dunbar ! " Williams called . " Lieutenant Grant ! Take your men to the river bank and see there 's no trouble . I want all the other officers to take their men out of this crowd . Get . ' em back to their camps where they belong . " He never took his eyes off Butterfield . Behind me I heard the voices of officers calling their men by name . " Now , captain , " Williams said to Butterfield , " just step to one side and let this Indian join his company . We want ' em out of camp , all of ' em . " " I do n't care what you want ! " Butterfield said . " That red rattlesnake ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powder ! I wo n't back down for those dirty rats . " " You 've got your orders , Captain Butterfield , " Williams said coldly . " Let this man through . " " You go to hell ! " Butterfield shouted furiously . " You Britishers think you can throw us any kind of an order , no matter whether there 's sense to it or not . Well you ca n't ! We 've got brains  --  just as many as you have  --  and better ones , too , most of the time ! " From somewhere in the eircle of silent Rangers came a hoarse whisper , clearly heard by everyone : " You lousy provincial ! " The ring of men wavered and shifted . I saw three or four provincials move around behind Butterfield , and realized that nearly all the men close to him were provincials . Butterfield 's face , which had so recently been scarlet with excitement , had grown pale . " Lousy provincials ! " he said in a shaking low voice . " Lousy provincials ! That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englishmen be if it was n't for us  --  you and your murdering Highlanders and your drunken black Irishmen ? You 'd be two feet underground , where you belong ! You ai n't Rangers ! You 're brass-button soldiers filled with pizened skunk water and sawdust ! " On the edge of the circle a man from a Highland regiment suddenly hit one of the provincials on the jaw . Two provincials jumped at him and the three went down in a tangle of fists . MeNott leaped for the struggling men , dragged them apart , sent the Highlander flying with a tremendous kick , jerked one of the provincials to his feet and slapped his face resoundingly . Then , as if he 'd completed one slight task and was ready to take up another , he looked about him invitingly , wait , ing for further infractions of discipline . " Captain Butterfield , , " Williams said , " if provincials have a bad reputation among regular troops , it 's because of actions like yours . That Mohawk is going safely out of this camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answering , Butterfield snatched at the bag of powder beneath the Mohawk 's arm . The Mohawk threw himself on the ground , and in a moment the circle of men had turned into a sort of human whirlpool  --  a maelstrom of struggling , kicking , shouting , cursing maniacs , all filled , seemingly , with the desire to tear each other to shreds . I saw the Mohawk , still clutching his musket and powder bag , creeping among the feet of these grunting , fist-swinging madmen ; saw Butterfield kick him brutally in the side . The Mohawk writhed like a snake , grasped the knife that hung by a thong on his breast , and plunged it into the powder bag . ? I heard MeNott shouting violently in my ear . Hunk 's contorted face appeared close to mine ; his flailing arm struck my chest and swept me out of the circle and flat on my back . Then I heard a musket shot , followed instantly by a gigantic thump  --  more of a stupendous concussion than an explosion . It seemed almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my body , the hair from my head ; it shut off my breath as thoug4 an invisible feather bed had fallen on me . When I got to my knees , dazed , the cluster of men who a moment before had been the incarnation of violent euergy were stretched on the ground , a smoldering , feebly moving tangle of human wreckage from which came groans and itieoherenees . The air was filled with the thick and salty smell of gunpowder , the musty odor of burning leather , and high in the trees hung a slowly drifting cloud of bluish smoke . I was conscious of men running from all sides toward this writhing , smoking heap . I crawled among them myself , looking for Hunk Marriner . I recognized him by his fair hair . He was on his knees , pawing with one hand at the shoulder of his Ranger 's smock , from which came wisps of gray smoke , and his face and bands were black . " Wait , " I said , " let it alone , Hunk ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sawed the sleeve from his shirt and peeled it down his arm . Powder had somehow blown inside his shirt and burned there , leaving his whole shoulder black and streaked with blood . " Can you put it out ? " Hunk asked . " It 's still burning . " " No , " I said . " It 's out . It 's all out . Put your arm around me and I 'll get you away from here . " Hunk lifted his hands . Both palms were blown full of powder grains . " I damned near got that powder bag from him , " he said . " I almost had my hands on it when he fired his musket into it . What happened to the Mohawk ? " I heard MeNott 's voice behind me , husky and sour . " He got away . " I looked around . MeNott. sat with his legs stretched straight in front of him . His face was as black as Hunk 's . The left leg of his breeches had been slit open , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed white through the blackened , bloody flesh . Ogden came behind us and looked closely at the sergeant . " Here 's McNott , " he told the Rangers with him . " Move him up on the ridge . " Two men stooped down and got him under the arras . " Careful of that leg , " MeNott said , " or I 'll wring your necks ! Half my leggings got blown into that hole . " " I 'll take Marriner , " I told Ogden . " They 'll hurt his shoulder if they try to carry him . " I got him around the waist and hoisted him to his feet . When I turned him toward the knoll , Captain Williams came up to us and looked hard at Hunk 's shoulder . The captain was almost unrecognizable . The whole side of his face was blown full of powder , his left eye was completely closed , and the tow-colored hair on half his head had been singed off , leaving a charred stubble . Captain Ogden , at his elbow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be looked at . captain , You ought to have it tended to . " " It 's nothing , captain , " Williams said cheerfully . " I 'm quite all right . Just take care of the others and do n't worry about me . " To Hunk he said , " You behaved well . You very nearly saved us all . " " I thought I had it , " Hunk said . " I ought to known what he figured on doing when he stuck his knife in the bag . " " Not at all , " Williams said . " Not . at all ! You acted as quickly as anyone could have . You 'll make a good Ranger . I 'd be pleased to have you in my company . " He peered at Hunk 's wound out of his one good eye . " Yes , " he added with simulated cheerfulness . " You 'll be all right  --  all right . " Swaying like a drunken man , he turned to leave us , but Ogden took him by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his closed , puffed eye a stream of moisture had washed a white furrow on his blackened cheek . The sickening thought struck me that in all probability he would never lead another company ; that Hunk might not only never serve in any company but never even hold a musket to his shoulder again . I had made my friend as comfortable on the knoll as I could and was picking powder from his wound when I saw Rogers coming back to the camp from his excursion to look at the sloops . I had expected him to show violent anger at what had happened , or perhaps grief ; but what I seemed to read in his face was a sort of grim amusement and a idled of regretful relief . Then Sergeant Bradley came to look after Hunk , and I left them and went to Rogers with the orderly book . Officers crowded close around him , and before him stood Captain Butterfield , making a , halting explanation . He seemed entirely unhurt . " We needed that powder , " Butterfield said . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' taken it away from him without any trouble , and none of this would have happened . " Rogers laughed . " You do n't know what would have happened ! You were dealing with an Indian , and you ought to have known you ca n't take liberties with an Indian . No matter how these Indians behave , we need to keep ' em friendly . We 've got enough unfriendly ones yowling around us without adding to the number ! " He pulled his hat down on his head , glared at his officers ; then fixed his eyes upon Butterfield again . " That 's all beside the point . The point is that you did n't maintain discipline , and the moment discipline 's gone , everything 's gone . You lost your head , and maybe it 's a good thing for the rest of us that you did I An officer who loses his bead once will usually do it again ; so it 's better to have it happen now than later , when we might not have got out of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnestly , " I did n't lose my head . I knew what I was doing every minute . It was the others lost their heads . " " I wo n't argue the point , " Rogers said , " but when somebody loses his head , you can usually count on one thing  --  the only one who is n't hurt is the one who lost his head . Everybody else suffers in one way or another . I notice you did n't get hurt . " Anyway , Captain Butterfield , you 're going back ! You 've done enough damage to my men ; and if I have you court-martialed , you 'll probably do more . I guess it 'll be enough punishment if you go back and report to General Amherst that sickness prevented you from going farther than Otter River . You 're sick , and so are the provincials who 'll return with you , and the Rangers and the regulars who 'll have to go back because of this . These men are either sick or burned with gunpowder  --  that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He moved a few steps toward the boats , than turned and called , " Captain Williams . " Williams moved forward , supported by Captain Ogden . " Captain Williams , " Rogers said , " I 'm putting you in charge of all these sick men  --  Indians , Rangers , regulars and provincials . Move ' em back , away from this camp , and start home at once . The rest of us 'll stay right here . " Captain Williams was a pitiful spectacle ; for , although Captain Ogden had made an effort to wash off the powder stains , the flesh around his damaged eye was raw and bloody , and his other eye was almost closed in sympathy , so that he was obliged to throw his head far back in order to see . Blisters had formed where the hair had been burned from his scalp . " Major , " he said , moving his lips with difficulty , " I 'll be all right in a day or two . This is n't anything . I can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musket right now if I had to . I can march as well as ? " " You 're going back , captain , " Rogers said . " Those are your orders . You 'll have to go back by land . I 'm taking all the boats with me . You 'll take every Ranger and every regular who was burned or who has powder marks OR his uniform . " " Major , " Captain Williams mumbled , " I 'd like to say one more word . " " All right , " Rogers said . " Say it . " " Major , " Williams continued , " that 'll mean sending back pretty near thirty men , not counting the Mohawks . Counting the Mohawks , you 'll lose over forty men . That 's 20 per cent  --  a higher percentage than you 'd lose in two battles if you had bad luck . I do n't believe you can afford that many , Major . Could n't you reconsider those orders , Major ? I figure practically all of us could make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us . " " Look hero , captain , " Rogers said , " you ca n't bandage that eye properly . You do n't even know what 's happened to it . You ca n't keep the flies out of it . What 'll happen if you go blind in the woods ? I 'll have to send another man home with you ! I wo n't take the chance ! Captain Williams , you 're going back because you 're incapacitated , and so are some others ; but the most are going because they have n't shown themselves subject to discipline . If there 'd been a hundred in it , I 'd send a hundred back . I do n't care how big a percentage of ' em I lose if they are n't subject to discipline . I 'd make this expedition with fifty men  --  yes , with ten mon  --  and do more with those ten than I could do with two hundred that did n't obey orders . " He lowered his head and stared at his officers out of stony ayes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , understand ? Rangers ! They are n't Scotehmen or Englishmen or Irishmen or provincials or regulars or anything else ; they 're Rangers ! If I find two Irishmen leagued together as Irishmen and not as Rangers , I 'll send ' em home if we 're within twenty feet of whore we 're going . "
