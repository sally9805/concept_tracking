On President Roosevelt 's mind last week was the Roosevelt Bull Market , now running into its 19th month . To the White House he summoned the two men the New Deal has charged with responsibility for the stockmarket 's behavior , Chairman Marriner Stoddard Eccles of the Federal Reserve Board , which controls margins and credit , and Chairman James McCauley Landis of the Securities &; Exchange Commission , which has the police powers . On leaving the White House , Chairman Landis said nothing . Chairman Eccles reiterated the well-known fact that the long rise has been largely a cash affair-a pronouncement which in another Administration might have been taken as a bullish tip straight from the White House . But the official attitude toward the stock-market was characterized in Washington last week as sternly " vigilant . " <P> Greatly heartened in this vigilance was SEC by the Roosevelt victory . It meant a clear path for the investment trust regulation which SEC will recommend to the next Congress . It was a full-speed signal for SEC 's plan for segregating the function of broker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exchange on that subject being scheduled for this week . And it was apparently considered a general order to SEC for brisker performance on its regular beat patrolling the U. S. securities business . <P> Down cracked SEC last week with a restraining order on eight individuals for alleged manipulation of Suburban Electric Securities Co. on the Boston Stock Exchange . Down cracked SEC on the big New York Stock Exchange house of W. E. Hutton &; Co. and an Oakland ( Calif. ) partner of William Cavalier &; Co. for alleged manipulation of Atlas Tack , a luckless stock whose gyration once attracted the attention of the New York Attorney General ( TIME , Jan. 1 , 1933 ) . In that operation Atlas was strong-armed from a Depression low of $1 per share to a 1933 high of nearly $35 , only to relapse the same year to $1.50 . Last winter Atlas climbed rapidly from $9.50 per share to about $30 , a rise which SEC says it ' ' has reason to believe and does believe " was not spontaneous . <P> Bitterly resenting the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were broadcast to the Press , James M. Hutton Sr. , head of the 50-year-old Cincinnati firm , cracked back in a flat denial : " It the stock went up purely because of the ancient law of supply and demand that has been in effect much longer than the law under which the Securities Commission operates . " <P> But it was not to discuss such station-house matters as Atlas Tack that President Roosevelt summoned Messrs . Landis &; Eccles last week . As was later revealed at a White House press conference , President Roosevelt was deeply concerned over the amount of foreign capital now invested in the U. S. , particularly the large sums of timorous money which have sought temporary refuge in Manhattan and might be repatriated at an embarrassing rate should confidence be restored abroad . Both SEC and the Federal Reserve Board , said the President , were studying how to control this " hot " money by legislation .
