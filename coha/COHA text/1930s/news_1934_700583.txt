txt A hard battle between the Senate and House over the upper branch 's amendments to the " loophole plugging " tax bill was indicated today as experts started to check up on just what happened to the measure in the Senate . Chairman Doughton of the Ways and Means Committee was openly hostile to important Senate amendments . He regarded the tax increases written into the measure as entirely outside the original intent of the new revenue legislation . I do n't like very much some of the things the Senate put into the bill , " said Mr. Doughton . " I guess it was just a case of Senate superiority , something to justify their existence . " That the administration needed the money may be all right . Originally we did n't ? bring out a bill to increase taxes generally , but rather to stop the loopholes in the income tax laws . I do not approve the Couzens amendment . " If we are going to make revisions for the purpose of raising taxes there should be a general revision of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all concerned . " I was sold originally on the idea of consolidated returns , but after the hearings , particularly with railroad and public service corporations , I changed my mind . " To deny them consolidated returns would cause hardships . I would rather let a few get away with something than put a hardship on all corporations . " Confer With President . President Roosevelt , who conferred with legislative leaders today , was represented as strongly opposed to the Senate 's provision for a three-cent-a-pound duty on cocoanut oils and copra from the Philippines . He urged elimination of this feature , declaring that such an excise was a violation of good faith with the islands and would deprive them of the source of much of their normal revenue during the period before they became independent . According to conference participants , the President made no objection to other features of the revenue Bill , including the 10 per cent added tax on income returns . The Revenue Bill was discussed in great detail , with the President raising no opposition to the publicity feature or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today on the Vice President 's desk , awaiting return to the House . Senator Harrison said that it would not be " messaged " back to the lower body until after it had been printed with the Senate amendments , and committee experts had had an opportunity to check the new provisions . It is not expected to go to conference before Wednesday . When the measure reached the Senate it contained provisions estimated to produce $258,000,000 a year in new revenue . The increase was to be made up chiefly by stopping the loopholes through which legal tax avoidance had been possible . Through revision by the Senate committee the yield expectations of the bill were shoved up to $330 , - 000,000 . The principal new provision in the Finance Committee draft was an amendment for continuance of the present capital stock and excess-profits levies , to add $95,000,000 . After some deductions , the Finance Committee reported the measure to the Senate with a net increase of $72,000,000 . Once in the Senate , the bill fell quickly into the hands of the " liberal " element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provisions had been inserted calculated to add more than $220,000,000 to the yield provided by the House . The chief provisions adopted by the Senate were for outright tax increases ? $102,000,000 for the estate and gift taxes , $95,000,000 for the capital stock and excess-profits levy and $55,000,000 in income taxes for 1934  --  and for abolishing the privilege of corporations to file consolidated returns . Despite the expected contest over the Senate amendments , it is predicted at the Capitol that a substantial tax increase over the House bill will finally go through . The capital stock and excess-profits levies are said to have a good chance of remaining in the bill , and some increase in the estate and gift taxes may be approved , by the House . The Senate provision counted now as surest to go out in conference is the added " emergency " 10 per cent tax on all personal income returns , which would be expected to yield $65,000,000 for the next fiscal year .

Mr. Treadway said that it was perfectly evident that the " progressives " in the Senate had run away with the bill . " It was to be expected that the Senate would make some changes in the House bill , " Mr. Treadway said , " but it was not anticipated that the bill would be so completely rewritten without regard either to the advice of the administration or to the possible effect of increased taxes upon business and recovery . " Mr. Treadway estimated that the Senate bill would add $500,000,000 to the country 's tax burden . The increases were adopted , he said , " just to satisfy the hobbies of a few Senators .
