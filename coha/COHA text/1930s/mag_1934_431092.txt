 | SILENCE is golden . Always bear that in mind , Marie , " my Imperial Aunt Elizabeth of Austria , admonished me when she chose me as her confidante . The Empress-Queen was then a woman of forty , and I a girl of sixteen . Her solemn words impressed me , and I abided by her advice for many years ? alas , too many ! Because I saw nothing , heard nothing , said nothing ? especially in affairs d'amour ? I now find myself described in the pages of history with annoying frequency as a half-mysterious , half-villainous actress in the dynastic drama of the Imperial Hapsburgs to which only the end of the Word war wrote fins . But today , at the biblical three-scoreand-ten plus , I have decided to  | tell my story to the world at last . I propose to permit the reader a peep into the Hapsburg closet . Do not imagine , however , that it is my purpose to rattle the imperial skeletons . I merely intend to lift , here and there , dusty corners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rectified at last . I shall attempt to prove not only that the ghosts that clatter through the crumbling castles are kin of those that hide in the cupboards of the commoner , but also that historical truth is frequently so strange as to put to shame even the most fantastic fiction . A fair example of this is my own life 's story , leading from the Imperial palace in Vienna , where I was lady-in-waiting to my fascinating aunt , to my present humble home in one of the oldest cities of my native Bavaria . Now , a septuagenarian , I have returned to live in the shadow of the very monastery where I was born . The circle seems complete . Meanwhile I have roamed the world and , in the inverted order of the old saw , have traveled from riches to rags , at least figuratively speaking . Perhaps nothing presents more clearly the two great contrasts in my life than that day in New York City in 1926 , when the Theatre Guild invited me , as the last surviving niece of the one-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premiere of Franz Werfel 's " Juarez-and Maximilian . " That night I came from my ' less than modest lodgings on the top floor rear of a third-rate sailors ' boarding house in Hoboken , N. J. , to see my uncle 's sad fate reenacted on the stage . My still abundant hair done up et l'imperatrice in heavy braids around my head , as fashion decreed half a century ago , I bore a striking resemblance to my imperial Aunt Elizabeth ? Aunt Sissy to me . In the theatre I noticed the wondering glances of those about me ; they shook their heads as if seeing a ghost . I felt like shaking my own head ; for there on the stage moved the wraiths of loved ones whom I once had known well , They were all dead and gone . only I was left to tell the story . . I do not want the readers of my story to draw the conclusion that life has embittered me , because it has n't ! Of course , if I had my life to live over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the tragi-comedy of history ; but such things are not always of our own choosing . Undoubtedly fate thrust a strange role upon me . Had I. instead of being born a morganatic flower on the family tree of the royal Wittelsbachs , first blinked at the light of day from under a letter carrier 's lowly roof , my life would have been far less exciting . Yet it would have been much happier . MY FATHER , Duke Ludwig of Bavaria , was a young , dashing captain in a crack cavalry regiment when he met my mother , plain Henrietta Mendel . For many years her father had served the Grand Duke of Hesse as personal valet , enjoying the confidence of his royal master . In gratitude for his valet 's services , the Grand Duke furnished the necessary funds to launch my mother and her older sister Elsie on a stage career . Elsie in time became a celebrated opera singer ; my mother , however , did not feel any strong inclination for the stage , but the wish of the Grand Duke was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Augsburg . It was there that His Royal Highness , Duke Ludwig of Bavaria , member of the  | reigning House of Wittelsbach , resplendent in his cavalry uniform , galloped into the heart of the young actress . His proposal of marriage caused bitter quarrels in the exalted family . Nevertheless , he remained firm and , with the help of his imperial sister , Elizabeth , who happened to be visiting in Munich at that crucial moment , he finally succeeded in obtaining the consent of the family . However , upon the insistence of his father , Duke Maximilian , he had to renounce his first-born rights to succession . To assuage the ruffled feelings of the royal family , my mother was accorded the title of Baroness von Wallersee , by King Maximilian II of Bavaria , chief of the House of Wittelsbach . From their very first meeting , Empress Elizabeth became greatly attached to her beautiful commoner sister-in-law . " Your mother Henrietta , " the Empress said to me in later years , " was the most beautiful girl I ever saw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was primarily on the strength of the affection Aunt Sissy felt for her that my mother was never treated as an inferior . She was not only on excellent terms with Empress Elizabeth but also with Queen Marie of Naples , the Empress 's younger sister . It seems that both majesties found in my mother a woman whose inborn understanding of life and love had not been corrupted by the artificialities of court routine . More than once the Empress , as well as the Queen , took her innermost secrets to Mother . Upon her death , a whole sheaf of notes of the most intimate character came into my possession under the stipulations of her will . Not only feminine royalty felt drawn to my mother ; EmperorKing Francis Joseph I looked upon her with favor , too . Once , in my presence , he introduced her to his exalted relative , the Grand Duke Ferdinand of Tuscany ? " Uncle Nando " ? as " my dear sister-in-law Henrietta . " At Godollo he frequently led my mother to the dinner table . And , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her death my mother was entombed at the ducal mausoleum in Castle Tegernsee . My parents brought me up with Spartan simplicity but , - at the same time , surrounded me with devoted love . While my father saw to it that I spent twice as much time with his horses as with my dolls , and finally succeeded in making of me a tolerable circus rider , able to perform bareback and other stunts , my mother insisted that I receive a good general education . I recall as vividly as if it happened only yesterday , how my paternal grandmother , Duchess Ludovica , flew into a notso-royal rage when she heard that I was receiving instruction in Latin , shorthand , and music . None of her own children had had such a thorough education . As a matter of fact , none of them had learned more than seemed absolutely necessary for princes and princesses of royal blood . My father 's sisters used to walk through the streets of Munich without any chaperones , and their general upbringing had not been exactly high-toned . Plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One characteristic touch of my father 's inbred simplicity was his predilection for " dunking " at the breakfast table . Not even in an imperial castle would he forego his beloved custom of dipping his morning roll in his coffee . Of my father 's many sisters and brothers ,  | the two to whom I not only became most attached but who also figured most conspicuously in my life were my two Aujestiitcn Tanten ? majesty aunts ? Empress Elizabeth and Queen Marie . Of course , I had other aunts , but they were mere Royal Highnesses and were not addressed as Majesties . There were Aunt Helen , Princess of Thurn and Taxis ; Aunt Sophie Charlotte , Duchess of Alencon ; and Mathilda Ludovica , Countess Trani . It was between my Aunt Empress ? Tante Kaiserin ? and my Aunt Queen ? Tank Koniginthat I shuttled back and forth when a child . They were both extremely beautiful . While Empress Elizabeth sparkled with rare intelligence and was given to clever sarcasm and the quick coining of bon mots , Queen Marie was rather phlegmatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was still lamenting her first and only love . . . something which could not exactly be said of Aunt Sissy . I think the fact that I was a love child accounts for the Empress of Austria 's great interest in me from the very moment I was ushered into this world . Gradually , however , her maternal love toward me gave way to less idealistic considerations . First I was her favorite niece ; later I became her most trusted lady-in-waiting . The Empress was a curious mixture of formidable sphynx and good fairy . When I came to know her intimately , she was just rounding out her fortieth year . Perhaps the " dangerous age " accounted for her peccadillos which alternately fascinated and exasperated me , when a girl of sixteen . Despite her mature years Aunt Sissy was not only of striking appearance , her girlish figure kept in trim by long walks and horseback riding , but still radiant with beauty . She was the fortunate possessor of that outstanding feminine asset which , during my American sojourn , I came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sissy was the first woman I ever met who used a compact . . . only we did not call it that at the end of the last century . A tiny golden case , it contained a small quantity of poudre de riz of French make . The first time I remember riding horseback in company with the Empress was as a little girl . My blonde hair flew wildly as I cantered with my adored aunt through the Prater , Vienna 's Central Park . People stopped , lifted their hats or bowed deeply . Their eyes followed me and my fluttering mane . When we returned to the Hofburg , the , imperial palace , that day , . Aunt Sissy issued the order that I was to wear my hair a l'imperatrice in future . I have never changed my style of hairdress to this very day . Aunt Sissy herself had the most wonderful hair I have ever seen . Healthy , luxuriant hair has been a family characteristic of ours , but nobody could claim hair quite like Aunt Sissy 's . It was chestnut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was @#  | proud of her hair and gave it the best of care . A Mrs. von Feyfalik wielded the imperial brush and comb for decades ; it was she who taught my maid how to dress my hair . In my eyes Aunt Sissy seemed to possess the beauty of a fairy queen , especially when she was in good humor . At times her lovely brown eyes flashed gay mischief and , then again , angry disapproval . She had an enchanting smile , and her voice was soft and melodious . I was completely fascinated by her , and my happiness knew no bounds whenever I was told that I would meet Tanta Kaiserin . Naturally I was delirious with joy when , during my visit to the Empress at Feldafing in Bavaria , in the summer of 1876 , she suddenly remarked to my parents . " Why not leave Marie with me ? " I was not permitted to stay then and there , but two days later I returned from Munich , not with bag and baggage , but bringing along horse and saddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my imperial aunt . That day marked the beginning of a new period in my life . It was then that I became the steady companion of my exalted aunt . At first I was shy , and more than once I wished myself at home . But the Kaiserin was extremely kind , and her little daughter , the Archduchess Valerie , at that time eight years old , seemed greatly attached to me . When I did not accompany the Empress on her morning canter , I spent my time with " the little woman " ? die kleine Trait ? the young archduchess 's nickname at court . I had to accustom myself to many new things , and it was the Empress herself who trained me . Aunt Sissy told me how to behave on different occasions , what I should and what I should not do . She made it especially clear to me when it was safe to speak and when it was wise to remain silent . It was during one of my sojourns at Feldafing that my imperial aunt impressed upon my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " IN SEPTEMBER , joined by my parents , I accompanied Aunt Sissy to Godollo near Budapest , one of the residences of the imperial family . This castle , surrounded by beautiful woods abounding with game , was presented by the Hungarian nation to Emperor Francis Joseph I when he was crowned Apostolic King of Hungary in 1867 , following the socalled Ausgleich ? compromise ? which concluded the Magyar revolution of 1848 . In Vienna during the colder months opera and court balls were the attractions , while in Godollo during fall the chase was the main activity . Hunting became an official function . Looking extremely well astride one of his blueribbon thoroughbreds , the Emperor as well as his guests wore the prescribed dress ? crimson frock coat and high silk hat . Only Count Nicholas Esterhazy , as Master of the Hunt , wore a green coat . He was the most important personage from Meet to Mort ? the bugle call at the kill terminating the hunt . All these things I had hitherto known only from hearsay . Now I was to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think I slept a wink that first night at Godollo . I had ridden in a paper chase , but here I would experience my initial fox hunt . I was trembling with suppressed excitement . In the morning the Empress 's waiting woman came into my room with one of Auntie 's riding habits over her arm . I donned it eagerly , and we found that it fitted perfectly . " It is Her Majesty 's command that if it fits , I should leave it here for Your Grace , " the waiting woman said , and disappeared . I stood before a tall mirror , admiring myself in an almost new , extremely well-tailored riding habit with all the necessary accessories . The most valuable piece of jewelry could not have given me a greater thrill . I had , of course , fine riding habits which had been given to me by Aunt Marie , who used to send me clothes from Paris . This habit , however , was different . It had been tailored with the greatest smartness ? in a word , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I arrived at the meet , the Empress was greeted by the Master of the Hunt , Count Nicholas Esterhazy . All the other gentlemen saluted solemnly by doffing their high silk hats . The Empress introduced me first to Count Esterhazy , then to Count Elemer Batthyany . Although she merely said , " This is my niece Marie , " there was something in her voice and the way she looked at the Magyar noblemen that puzzled me at the time . ON THAT day , for the first time , I felt the heavy breath of history upon me . It was 1876 , and only a little less than three decades after the Magyars had revolted against the Hapsburgs under the leadership of their aristocracy , headed by Count Ludwig Batthyany , father of Elemer . The latter , deeply devoted to the Empress , loyally recognized her as Queen of Hungary . However , he would have nothing to do with Francis Joseph as Apostolic King of Hungary . He could never forget that the Kaiser had signed his father 's death warrant . That day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after greeting the Empress and being introduced to me , actually slighted the Monarch in the most flagrant manner imaginable . He turned his horse and , without ' so much as a salute , rode off brusquely . The affront was so noticeable that I pondered over it until the chase got under way . I did not notice any difference from the paper chase I had attended in Bavaria until my horse suddenly refused to take a wide ditch . I had to sit tight to the saddle to keep from being thrown . Suddenly , while I was struggling with my mount , trying to force him to take the obstacle , I heard a voice beside me , " Can I be of any assistance to you , Baron-ess ? " The voice was well modulated and had an interesting Hungarian intonation . I did not reply or even turn around . I did not intend to give anybody the satisfaction of saying that I had encountered difficulties at my very first fox hunt . I turned my mount around , gave him the spurs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stubborn animal to take the ditch with an elegant jump . Then I raced on . The cavalier who had offered his assistance was Count Elemer Batthyany . He escorted me for the rest of the chase , and I felt gratified that I had proved myself a good horsewoman . When we returned to Castle Godollo , Aunt Sissy remarked rather slyly : " Count Nicky Esterhazy expressed himself very favorably about you . You should feel very proud indeed , for as a rule young girls bore him terribly . " I was not at all flattered . Count Esterhazy had struck me as a medium-sized , stoutish man with intelligent , penetrating eyes , rather blase and super-sophisticated . At least , that was the first impression I had of him . After a while Aunt Sissy , apparently for no reason at all , added : " Did you notice how Elemer Batthyany acted to the Kaiser ? His mother is behind it all . She 's still preaching the gospel of hate against the Emperor , despite all I have done to reconcile the Magyars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew , and almost everybody else in the whole Dual-Monarchy knew , how for years and years Aunt Sissy had schemed and worked to bring about the Compromise . There were , however , still some intransigents keeping alive the old antagonism . " By the way , " the Empress continued , " how did you like Elemer ? I noticed he was riding with you all the time , and he certainly tried to entertain you . " Her voice sounded  | ironical , but she nevertheless appeared pleased . I was still too much dazzled by my new life to ponder long over Aunt Sissy 's enigmatic remarks . While we were at Godollo , Crown Prince Rudolf came on one of his infrequent visits to his mother . Aunt Sissy did not seem very happy over her eldest 's arrival . I had not seen my cousin for some years and still remembered him as a mere boy . He was a few years my senior . Despite international gossip 1 never entertained the slightest intention of finding favor in his eyes . Certainly I never planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been stated . Rudolf was never sympathetic to me , and somehow , even today , hen I think of him , I recall the annoying habit he had of pulling my long braids when we were children . Of course , Rudolf did nothing of the sort any longer , for he was a young man then . Although just as sarcastic and fidgety as formerly , he talked intelligently . He had studied assiduously and was keenly interested in everything . Even the Empress , who felt somewhat estranged from her oldest son , on account of the interference of her mother-in-law , had to admit that Rudolf carried a good head on his broad shoulders . IN AN offhand way Aunt Sissy warned me to be rather careful and restrained with Rudolf . He had a habit of " pumping " people and making arrogant , insinuating remarks . When he saw me at Godollo , he looked at me in his supercilious manner and drawled : " I see you are wearing your hair in a crown like Mother . You are still the same monkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I snapped back . " We are relatives , are n't we ? " Rudolf laughed . There were many more such verbal duels between us . Fortunately I did not see much of him because he went hunting most of the time . But whenever I ran across him , he felt called upon to tease me . Once , when he had seen me exchange a few words with Count Elemer , he sneeringly asked : " Tell me , Marie , are they putting you on the marriage market ? Well , if it 's Elemer , you certainly have my blessings . On the other hand , it would be still funnier if they made you marry Nicky Esterhazy . " He broke into raucous laughter . This conversation occurred after a Sunday dinner , while the Emperor was still in the room . Nevertheless I turned toward Rudolf and snapped : " I do n't have to do anything of the kind . Nobody can make me marry anybody . Besides , nobody has any such ideas . " That evening I reported the conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ com-mented , " Thank Heaven , Rudolf is going to leave us the day after tomorrow . " This wide gulf between mother and son struck me as distinctly queer . Their strained relations could only be attributed to that meddling old woman , Archduchess Sophie , doting but self-willed mother of the Emperor . No sooner had Cousin Rudolf left Godollo than an English couple arrived . As both of them were extremely good equestrians , the Impress had invited them , overlooking everything else ; her impulsiveness became the more evident the farther she was removed from Vienna and its strict etiquette . The naivite of the couple in matters of court life was simply overwhelming . The Englishman was a well-to-do squire from Cheshire ; his wife , a rather unassuming person , not too well educated , and obviously ill at ease in imperial surroundings . Whenever the Empress conversed with her , the Englishwoman , to the great consternation of the entire court , would " Yes Ma'am " and " No Ma'am " her instead of addressing her imperial hostess as " Your Majesty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholesome , struck us as singularly crude . The British lady was neither good-looking nor young ; besides , she dressed in such atrocious taste that even my mother , who always thought up excuses for everybody , could not help shaking her head . The Squire was a genial soul , endowed with a stentorian voice . He never allowed himself to become the least bit flustered . Since they had not yet met the Emperor , Aunt Sissy arranged to have the English couple dine at the same table with the Kaiser as soon as the Monarch arrived for a few days ' hunting . The Squire was apparently pleased , but not at all awestruck . As Uncle Emperor did not speak English and the Squire knew hardly any German , Aunt Sissy entrusted me with the task of acting as interpreter . During those strenuous talks , with the always slightly taciturn Emperor on one side and the everlastingly talkative Englishman on the other ; I more than once deplored the fact that I was nearly as well versed in the Anglo-Saxon tongue as in my native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brain for every German word he knew , but primarily relying on expressive gestures and the loudness of his voice , sought to converse with the Emperor directly , his long arms waving in front of me like the sails of a Dutch windmill . With a friendly , if somewhat quizzical smile , and a nod of his head , the Emperor would pretend to understand what his guest wished to say . But it was plain that he had not the slightest idea what the Englishman was talking about . Time and again , Uncle Kaiser , with suppressed exasperation , ' turned toward me and whispered into my ear , " For heaven 's sake , Marie , what does that man want of me , anyway ? " Small wonder that I found it difficult to remain serious and act the part of an interpreter with the stolidity of a well-oiled automaton. 1 That same evening while I was bidding Auntie good-night in her boudoir , the Emperor came in and demanded : " For goodness ' sake , Sissy , where did you pick them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The Empress laughed , " Maybe they are not accomplished courtiers , but you should see what marvelous figures they cut on horseback . " " Perhaps , but if it can possibly be arranged , I would rather not eat with them , Sissy . It 's too much of a strain . " A FEW days later another English guest , Captain William " Bay " Middleton , arrived . He had been awaited impatiently by Aunt Sissy . The Empress had told me much about him . She had met him the year before while hunting in England , and during the entire season there he had been her steady companion . Middleton had been a captain in the cavalry and enjoyed a great reputation as a " gentleman-rider . " His means , however , were modest , for , as Aunt Sissy expressed it , " The poor devil has to live on his pension from the army . " Captain Middleton was not to stay in the castle , but was given the exclusive use of a little lodge at some distance from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the station calling for Captain Middleton , Aunt Sissy said as shyly as a young girl , " You 'll soon meet Bay , Marie . " And a happy smile suffused her face . Her evident anticipation of Captain Middleton 's arrival had aroused my curiosity to such an extent that , naturally enough , I was a little disappointed when I actually met him . Dressed smartly in a light-gray traveling suit , he was a bulky man in his early forties with flaming red hair and a miniature mustache to match . His ruddy face was liberally sprinkled with freckles ; his nose seemed a bit large . To offset these defects , his teeth gleamed with @#  | pleasing prominence , and his blue eyes twinkled merrily , inviting sympathy . " This is Captain Middleton , Marie . . . my niece and steady companion , " the Empress introduced us . The Englishman extended a gigantic hand , and immediately , in that handclasp , I felt as if I had always known him . There was that spontaneous contact between people attuned to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at once respectful and unceremonious . " Why did you invite those people ? " he asked , indicating the English couple . Aunt Sissy threw the Captain a significant glance . " Why , I had to . . . for your sake .. . your visit will not arouse so much curiosity here as long as I invited some compatriots of yours . You know there is a dreadful amount of gossip around this place , " the Empress added frankly . " But there , do n't worry .. . they wo n't interfere with us . " Aunt Sissy , however , was wrong ; the English couple did interfere . When we went out for a canter the same afternoon , the Empress motioned to Middleton that he should ride at her right side , until then the prerogative of the Squire , while his wife usually rode to the left of the Empress . The Squire tried his utmost to regain his old place of honor , availing himself of all the little equestrian tricks of which his consummate horsemanship was capable . Nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prance and rear and dance , Captain Middleton could easily cope with the Squire 's artifices . At last recognizing that he simply could not budge his countryman , the Squire sadly relinquished all hope of regaining his place to the right of the Empress . He next maneuvered his horse between Aunt Sissy and his wife , thus trotting at the Empress 's left . I noticed that he signaled to his wife to ride abreast of me , and I also perceived Aunt Sissy 's annoyance . In the circumstances it was absolutely impossible for her to exchange one single word with Captain Middleton without being overheard . SUDDENLY the Empress seemed to lose all patience with the whole silly game . She murmured something to Middleton , and a second later she and the Captain galloped off as if their steeds had been stung by wasps . The Squire , taken completely unawares , was startled for a few moments , especially as his horse first reared and then raced after the Empress and Middleton . Meantime , while I was taking in this scene , the mare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race . I must admit that the English couple certainly knew how to sit tight in their saddles . A regular race developed , with the Empress and Middleton ahead . Eventually we fell back , as the Englishwoman 's saddle strap had broken ; soon we lost sight of the Empress and the Captain . Aunt Sissy and Middleton arrived at the Castle much later than the rest of the cavalcade . Apparently the two had taken a detour . The Empress was so vexed with the English couple that she was on the point of curtailing their visit . But fortune favored her , for that very evening the Squire received a wire that his mother-in-law was ill and that they should return without delay . After they had left in great haste to catch the sight train , the Empress remarked sarcastically , " I do n't know whether it 's his mother or hers , and I generally do n't approve of mothersin-law " ? this was a little dig directed at the haiser 's mother , Archduchess Sophie ? " but here is one that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on a canter , I knew enough to remain behind while Aunt Sissy and Captain Middleton rode ahead . It was easy to see that the suite of the Empress was not favorably inclined toward the Englishman . Count Kicky Esterhazy treated him almost rudely . The only member of the court who befriended Middleton was Aristide Baltazzi.  | " You know , Marie , " said Aunt Sissy one evening after supper , the usual hour when she became confidential , " this animosity toward Bay is most aggravating . I am angry with Count Nicky . Since he became Master of the Hunt , he has developed a jealousy directed against anything and everything regarding English sport . He even went so far as to upbraid me because I enjoy hunting in England . " Aunt Sissy waxed eloquent in her abuse of Count Esterhazy and the others while at the same time praising Captain Middleton . " But , Aunt Sissy , " I inquired naively , " why does that annoy you so much ? " The Empress seemed taken aback . " How stupid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Naturally I do n't want to see a special friend of mine slighted in my own house . " I shook my head in complete bewilderment . Despite all the pondering I did that evening , it was not until some time later that I learned the real truth . I did not know then that I was witnessing the prelude to an exalted love union exalted not only because an Empress was cast in the chief role . I was still too unsophisticated to peer beneath the surface of the glamorous life of a great empress . It was clear enough , however , that the nearer the date of Captain Middleton 's departure , the more irritable Aunt Sissy became . She controlled herself admirably before the court , but when alone with me , she abandoned her reserve . " We shall really miss him , the good Bay , " she sighed on the eve of Middleton 's departure . I , too , regretted his leave-taking . He had proved to be an excellent companion . It had become his habit to address me as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have treated me more nicely . While he did not flatter the Empress , and at times even assumed an offhand manner , his behavior was always irreproachable . It was easy to see that he looked up to her as to a higher being ? and not only because she was an Empress . The day before Middleton 's departure was a Sunday . After dinner the Kaiser shook hands with the Englishman and wished him godspeed . To all appearances the Emperor liked Middleton , perhaps because of his snappy military bearing . CONTRARY to all custom , the Empress and Middleton inspected the stables in the afternoon , taking me along . The two lingered in front of the different paddocks while I kept at a distance . Although I distinctly realized that Aunt Sissy appreciated my discretion , I felt awkward indeed . In order to leave the two alone in an unobtrusive way , I remarked : " It 's turning rather cold . Shall I fetch a shawl for you , Aunt Sissy ? " Her eyes flashed with gratitude . " Good girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As I rushed off , she called after me : " It is n't that cool yet . You certainly need n't hurry so . " I took the hint and returned no sooner than I thought absolutely necessary , to find Aunt Sissy with moist eyes , her long slender hand tightly enclosed in Middleton 's . " I 'll see you tomorrow before you leave , Bay , " she nodded to the Captain . He bowed deeply , and without another word Aunt Sissy permitted me to drape the shawl around her shoulders . We left the stable then , with Middleton remaining behind . Supper that night was partaken under a dark cloud . Aunt Sissy made no attempt to assume a cheerfulness she did not feel . No sooner had dessert been served than , despite the fact that the Emperor himself was honoring us with his society , she left the table . When I saw her around noon next day , shortly after Middleton had been driven to the station , I found her in tears . I was petrified ; never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . " Dear Aunt Sissy , " I entreated , " do n't cry . You will see our red fox ' in a few months . " The Empress lifted her face , and her lips twisted in a tremulous smile . " You are right , Marie- I am acting like a silly child . " At that moment there was a knock at the  | door . The maid opened it , and I heard her whisper for a few seconds with the lady inwaiting standing outside . The maid returned . " His Majesty , the Emperor , " she announced . Aunt Sissy jumped up . " Under no circumstances must he see me like this , " she cried , dabbing at her eyes . " Quick , Marie , stop the Kaiser . Tell him that I am trying on lingerie . " Like a flash she disappeared into her bedroom . Simultaneously there was a sharp rap at the door , and Uncle Francis entered . I made my deepest curtsy . " Aunt Sissy is in her bedroom trying on lingerie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Uncle did not seem to notice my confusion . He held a telegram in. his hand . As was his habit , he pulled his mustache somewhat impatiently and said : " Sorry , I ca n't wait . Just take this wire to your Aunt Sissy and tell her I would like to know what she has to say about it before I leave Godollo . " With that he handed me the telegram , turned around , and strode from the room . No sooner had he gone than I rushed toward the bedroom door and knocked carefully , whispering that I was alone . First the maid peered through a crack in the door ; then the Empress came out . I handed her the wire . She glanced at it and remarked ruefully , " Just think ? all this commotion over that Trottel ? dunce ! " The dunce was none other than the Archduke of Tuscany , who politely inquired whether Their Royal and Imperial Majesties would be gracious enough to permit him to pay his respects at Godollo a fortnight ahead of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Trottel comes or whether he comes at all ! " Aunt Sissy handed the message back to me . " Run over to Uncle and tell him that any time will suit me for the Archduke 's visit . " " Shall I say the Trottel ? " I asked mischievously . " Ah , you 're one yourself , " Aunt Sissy laughed . LIFE IN Gedollo was unpretentious , especially when the Emperor was away on affairs of I state . Then we were just by ourselves . The morning was usually spent out of doors , while many a cozy afternoon and evening hour were whiled away in the music room . Usually the party consisted of Aunt Sissy , myself , and one or the other lady-in-waiting . It therefore surprised me greatly when , one forenoon , I received the Empress 's order to come to the music room . The lackey who brought the imperial command offered me a little slip of paper upon which Aunt Sissy in her almost illegible handwriting had jotted down the titles of a number of songs . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and " The Lotus Flower , " all compositions of poems by Heine , the German-Jewish poet whom the Empress well-nigh worshiped . Surprised as I was to be called upon for a musical entertainment so early in the day , I was aghast when I discovered that Aunt Sissy was not alone . The Empress , ensmnsed in a deep chair , looked more like a young girl that : ever in a white flannel dress . The gentleman standing in front of her was Count Nicky Esterhazy . The way I found the two reminded me of a little scene I had observed only a week or ten days previously , but Bay Middleton had been the cavalier then . Count Esterhazy advanced and bent over my hand for the conventional kiss , while I sought to gain my composure . There seemed to be some deviltry lurking in Aunt Sissy 's beautiful brown eyes as she looked from me to the Count and back again . " You are to sing just a few Lieder for us in a little while , Marie , " Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empress continued their conversation on horses , which apparently had been interrupted by my entrance . I felt very superfluous . Although I did not dare to  | show it , I was wild with indignation . In the first place , I would have to sing in the morning before I had a chance to practice ; besides , I resented this sudden command to act the part of an entertainer . At last all the equestrian questions in the world seemed to be settled between the two , and Aunt Sissy turned back to me . " Let me see what you brought along . " She looked at the music . " Fine . . . but this one I want you to sing last , " and she indicated " The Lorelei . " I sat at the piano trembling with suppressed anger , and , accompanying myself , I sang first " The Azra . " Count Nicky was lounging comfortably in a chair , not unlike a Turkish pasha . At his right was a little table on which stood half a bottle of champagne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next song , I heard Count Nicky remark to the Empress in Hungarian , of which I had a smattering then , " Really she has quite a pleasing voice . " His condescension only served to add fuel to my burning resentment . Next I sang " The Lotus Flower . " Again his complimentary remarks reached my ears . Hesitating a minute when I came to " The Lorelei , " I complained that I found it difficult to go on as my throat was dry . Immediately Count Nicky sprang to my side , offering a sip of champagne . I swallowed the sparkling drink and , with it , my hurt pride and anger . Like Aunt Sissy , the Count seemed especially bent upon hearing that song . Although I could not see the Empress from where I sat at the piano , I could watch the Count by glancing out of the corner of my eye into a wall mirror . I had hardly struck the first chord of " The Lorelei " when a remarkable change seemed to come over Nicky . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first few lines than he began staring at me in a curious , hard fashion . He blanched ; his eyes grew dark and unspeakably sad . I saw him turn his head slowly , and I knew that his eyes were piercing those of Aunt Sissy . Abruptly then , he jumped up and , with long strides , made for the windows , where he remained motionless . THE whole scene had a strange effect upon me though I only vaguely surmised its import . I do not know how I managed to finish the Lied , but somehow I did . As I struck the last note , I found Aunt Sissy at my elbow , handing me my music . " That was sweet , very sweet , Marie , " she said , making it unmistakably clear that I was no longer wanted . As I passed from the room , I caught one more glimpse of the Count standing so still at the window while Aunt Sissy remained in the center of the room as if rooted to the spot . The door closed behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something uncanny seemed to have touched me . What could it be ? My curiosity aroused , I eagerly sought to fit together more and more fragments of that great jigsaw puzzle of pre-war days , court life . In 0576 , at the Hofburg , the palace at Vienna , as well as at Godollo , the imperial summer residence near Budapest , the glitter and pomp were at their zenith . Next to Queen Victoria of England , my imperial Aunt Elizabeth was the most important personage of royal blood in the whole world . Though as yet untrained to pry beneath the surface , I knew that the Empress-Queen was very unhappy . At times she would sigh and just look at me , stroking my hair with a gesture of touching tenderness . On other days , she would be as happy and care free as a young girl . The presence of certain people seemed to bring her solace . In Godollo , Aunt Sissy preferred the company of Count Nicky Esterhazy . More than once I caught her glancing first at Nicky and then at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Count . It never occurred to me that my aunt carefully planned these meetings for reasons of her own . Once , when she did not feel well enough to @#  | partake in the hunt , she asked Uncle Kaiser to take care of me . I shall never forget the surprised face of Count Nicky when , in his official capacity , he came galloping up to the Emperor to report everything in readiness . He had expected to find the Empress with the Kaiser , but found me instead riding beside Francis Joseph . Obviously Aunt Sissy 's absence was a great disappointment to him . As soon as the opportunity presented itself , he sidled up close to me . He attempted to appear casual , but his voice vibrated with anxiety as he asked , " Why are you alone , Baroness ? " " Her Majesty has a slight cold , " I replied . Count Nicky nodded , his large dark eyes taking me in sharply before he slowly turned his horse and returned to his post of duty . No sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a rabbit hole , throwing me . The cavalcade raced past me , with apparently nobody paying any attention to my predicament ? a casual custom on those reckless rides . However , as I sprang to my feet , I found that Count Elemer Batthyany had observed my mishap and was leading back my mount by the reins . He dismounted and solicitously inquired , " Did you hurt yourself , Baroness ? " I laughed : " No , I just managed to get dirty , and I tore my sleeve . But that 's all . " He whipped out his handkerchief and flicked the dust off my habit , much in the manner one uses with a child . " Why , Count Elemer , perhaps you 'll even wipe off my face ? " I should n't mind , " he replied with a mean-ing glance . WE MOUNTED our horses and followed the others , but did not catch up with them until we reached the railroad station . There a light lunch was served for the hunting party in the Emperor 's dining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he clucked his tongue commiseratingly . " Well , well , a bite of lunch will be just the thing for you .. What 's left , anyway ? " the Kaiser inquired from somebody near by . " Just a few sandwiches , Your Majesty . " " What , no caviar canapes left ? " " Sorry , Your Majesty , all gone . " Without a moment 's hesitation the Kaiser marched to his own table . He returned with a few caviar canapes and a small glass of wine on a platter , which he graciously presented to me . " Gutet Appetit , " he said smilingly . In the evening , as usual , I went up to Aunt Sissy 's boudoir to bid her good-night and relate to her all that happened during the fox hunt . I was so engrossed in my own adventures that only when I was on the point of leaving the room I remembered to tell her that Count Nicky had inquired after her . Aunt Sissy seemed surprised that I had almost forgotten to include this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't you tell me that right away ? " she asked with a touch of annoyance . Then a smile flitted over her face , but I guessed that it was not meant for me . Little incidents of this nature could not fail i to stir the most unsuspecting mind . Gradually I had to admit to myself that there might be 1 some element of truth in the Hofklatsch ? court gossip ? revolving around the Empress and Count Nicky . Presently I witnessed a scene that amazed me in its striking implications , lending added weight to the rumors that already had reached my ears . I shrank from the obvious deduction brought home to me so vividly . The last shred of doubt in my mind was dispelled only a few years later when Aunt Sissy herself frankly owned up to the truth . The Empress , smiling pensively , recalled the strange situation in all its details . During a Hungarian lesson , which I took together with my little cousin , the Archduchess Valerie , her governess , Mrs. Scharak , brought word that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When we came upon  | the Empress , we found her with Count Nicky Esterhazy . He hardly seemed to notice me ; his attention was completely focussed on Valerie . It actually took my breath away when I suddenly realized the striking resemblance between his eyes and those of the child ? round , long lashed , and blazing with a dusky sheen . Never before , nor since , have I come across eyes such as those of Count Nicky and my cousin Valerie . The conversation between the man and child waxed so lively that a slight impediment in the child 's speech became rather conspicuous . Startled , I recognized it as an identical handicap from which the man suffered ! Valerie 's governess , who formerly had been a trusted retainer of the Esterhazy family , took in the scene between Count Nicky and the little Archduchess with an expression of complete understanding . Once she looked furtively over to Aunt Sissy , but the Empress avoided her gaze . At last I realized Aunt Sissy 's deep attachment for Count Nicholas Esterhazy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , would have thrown the Empress a knowing glance . I had , however , yet to surmise her purpose in throwing the Count and me together . On the day of a fox hunt at Gddollo , Aunt Sissy sent for me . Upon entering her suite I found her engaged in a lively discussion with Mrs. von Ferenczi . The conversation was carried on in Hungarian , and although I could not understand every word , I gathered that Aunt Sissy had made a decision of which her elderly lady-in-waiting disapproved . The poor woman seemed greatly distressed . ' Abruptly my aunt turned toward me . " You do n't know what fear is , do you , Marie ? " Without awaiting my answer she informed me that later in the evening Mrs. von Ferenczi would give me a letter . This I was to take to I the neighboring estate of Count Esterhazy and deliver it to his trusted butler , returning without delay . This struck me as decidedly odd , but I knew better than to ask questions . WHEN night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. von Ferenczi , and I immediately started on horseback through the dark woods to the hunting lodge of Count Esterhazy . I had my most dependable steed and sat astride , as Aunt Sissy and I were wont to do when we went riding after dusk . It was so much more comfortable and safer than sidesaddle . I knew every tree in the neighborhood and soon arrived at the door of the little twostory building . At my knock the Count 's butler stuck out his head through an upper-story window . I explained my errand to him in my limited Hungarian . The butler mumbled something about " waiting a minute , " obviously mistaking me for an ordinary messenger . The letter still in my hand , I waited , looking up at a row of windows illuminated by a greenshaded lamp . I concluded that either Count Nicky or his inseparable companion , Aristide Baltazzi , was at home . A few seconds later a light flickered down the stairs , the door opened , and Count Nicky stood before me . His dark round eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismount , wo n't you , please ? " Count Nicky said , stroking the neck of my horse , all the while staring at me because I sat astride my steed . " Permit me to say so , Baroness , " he said with a low bow , " you cut an even better figure riding astride than sidesaddle . " There was criticism , however , in his voice , and very understandably so , because in the seventies it was unheard of for a lady to ride man-fashion . I bent down to deliver the letter , ready to wheel around and gallop home . I felt humiliated in the extreme . Why had Aunt Sissy placed me in so embarrassing a position ? " Do come in for a moment , Baroness ! " Count Nicky appeared altogether composed now . I noticed that he was dressed in a long black lounging robe that would have made a drab outfit but for an unexpected patch of color provided by slippers of a vivid green .  | I dismounted rather reluctantly and followed him into the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more I presented it to the Count . He took it , throwing it carelessly on a near-by table . Then he invited me to sit down , all the while eyeing me with curiosity . I sat down , fidgeting nervously because I could see that he intended to question me . He proceeded with consummate diplomacy , asking whether " it had been found ? necessary to dispatch a young lady on an errand in the dead of the night . " " That 's just like her , " he grumbled , more to himself than for my benefit . " Sometimes she almost kills you with maternal affection , and then again she does n't give a hoot if you break your neck . But that 's like her .. . I feel almost like writing a few lines to your mother asking her to take you home to Munich . The Court is no place for a young girl . " " Please do n't do that , " I pleaded . He stared at me once more , plunging his dark eyes deeply into mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance I had caught by accident , some days before , when Aunt Sissy had made me sing " The Lorelei . " THE butler had meanwhile brought refreshments for me , and Count Nicky asked to be excused for a few minutes in order to change into his riding togs . " I shall certainly not let you make that trip back alone , " he said paternally . He must have divined my thoughts for he promptly added , " Do n't worry , I shall take you only as far as the gate of the castle . " I pointed to the letter . " Is there no answer ? " I knew there was no answer , but I thought the letter important and I wanted him to read it . " I am not in the habit of employing a young lady as an errand boy . " Count Nicky bowed and left the room . All through our nocturnal canter , he never uttered one word . When we reached the gate to Castle Godollo , he gripped my hand so hard I almost cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he reassured me . He lifted his hat . " Good-night ? Marie . " There was something in his voice that sent a shiver down my spine . It confused me so that I could not even reply . When I finally brought my horse around , he was gone . Entering the castle , I found Mrs. von Ferenczi in a state of exasperation . Excitedly she wanted to know what had happened to me , as I had taken so long . I did not offer any explanation ; I merely complained that I was terribly tired and locked the door to my room . Despite the fact that I was exhausted , my nerves were too jangled to permit sleep . In bed I racked my brains to discover Aunt Sissy 's reason for sending me on that nocturnal ride to Count Nicky . My mission struck me as pointless , and yet I realized that the Empress always knew what she was about . She must be hatching some scheme , but what could it be ? A sudden thought jerked me into a sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , " Tell me , Marie , are they putting you on the marriage market ? " Could it be , I wondered , that the Count figured in Aunt Sissy 's matchmaking plans for me ?
