txt ARE HIGH SCHOOLS FAILING ? Father Finds Decided Let-Down In Son 's Work and Wonders Why . To the Editor of The New York Times : I have a boy 15 years - old , now closing his second year of high school . As far as I can ascertain , not only has he not acquired anything of practical value , but he has actually retrogressed during the high school period . As a grammar school student he was , if not brilliant , at any rate able to maintain an average around 95 per cent and to pass two grades in one year . As a high school student he is apparently a total loss , with an average down in the low 80s and in some subjects even lower . Naturally I am worried , particularly as I find my experience Is by no means unique among parents of high school pupils . Careful analysis reveals the following among other possible reasons for this vital change in his personality and lack of interest in his work : 1 . A poor selection of subjects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all merit in the eyes of the pupils . 2 . A poor grade of instructor , temperamentally unable to command the respect , and mentally only a small degree above the pupil . 3 . Lax discipline , and total absence of all practical methods of disciplinary enforcement suitable for adolescents . 4 . " Mushy " co-edism , due to close association of boys and girls at the most susceptible age . 5 . Absence of male leadership suitable for older boys . 6 . Neglect of manual or vocational training . 7 . Lack of athletic training except in the case of a favored " team , " to the training of whom all the energies of the athletic instructor are devoted , while other students are totally neg-t lected. 8 . A " compartment " system of subjects whereby certain courses are restricted to certain " years " without recapitulation . In his two years my boy has acquired a small smattering of Latin , a worse hodge-poclge of French , some " civics , " history and what have you . His writing is illegible and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has practically forgotten much of his grade teaching , simply because he gets no " credits " for it in high school . In other words , his sole object is to scraps through by doing as little as may be of the unpalatable but compulsory subjects . He has no pride in his work and no anticipation of . his future . He has two more years of this to go through before he " graduates " ? when he will have to begin his education in real earnest . Pedagogues will probably blame the parent . I would willingly shoulder the responsibility but for the fact that with the decline of acholastio authority comes a corresponding resentment of parental authority ? what " we moderns " would probably call the " growth of independence . " I have tried my uttermost to penetrate this jungle of educational undergrowth , but the most satisfactory reply I can get is that " the Board of Regents " sets up the regulations and the faculty has nothing to do but enforce Clem . If this is the real reason , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few business men into it ? A MERE PARENT . New York , April 30 , 1930.
