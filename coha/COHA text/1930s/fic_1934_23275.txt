MENAGE A TROIS A STORY BY VINCENT SHEEAN CAME into the wide central halt of the house in a hurry . The scene which greeted him was , for the time of evening , somewhat bizarre . A huge crate stood in the middle of the hall , while a small , black-haired creature in a red dress and sweater lectured and gesticulated . " Lill ! What on earth are you doing ? Is n't it time we were both dressed ? " She stopped talking abruptly , bewildered . She frowned under her bushy black hair , trying to adjust herself to this voice from another world . " Hello , darling , " she said . " Have a nice game ? Is n't this lovely ? The piano has come . " She allowed herself to be kissed , but her eyes scarcely left the crate . " What piano ? " the man asked , staring over her head . " And anyway , what 's the difference ? Is n't it high time we were both dressed ? I can make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hours . " She patted his arm gently . " There , there , Martin , do n't be annoyed with me , " she said . " I honestly forgot all about dressing , and I ca n't remember what I 'm supposed to dress for anyway . I 'm terribly excited about the piano . What party is it now ? Must I go ? " " It 's the Mitchells , " he said , his words chopping out in crisp little clicks . " I 've told you a dozen times . They 're going away to-morrow . And we 've got to drive all the way to Nice by eight o'clock . It 's seven now . " She made a little dissatisfied noise through her nose , a mere phantom of sound , but one which he knew too well . " Darling , darling , " she said , still watching the silent blue-bloused workmen , " I do n't want to see the Mitchells . I never want to see the Mitchells . You know perfectly well that they are the dullest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they make me absolutely ill . " " You accepted the engagement , " said Martin coldly , moving toward the stairs . " I accepted ? " she echoed in surprise , staring after him . " My dear , you must be mad . I could n't possibly have accepted . You arranged it and informed me that we were going . I was n't ever consulted in the matter at any point . In my entire life I have never gone to dinner with such stuffed owls and jay-birds of my own free will . " Martin turned around at the foot of the stairs . " The stuffed owls and jaybirds , " he said , " are my friends . I went to school and college with George Mitchell . I know he 's no great brilliant figure , like your friends , but he 's a good fellow and he 's an important man in the motor business . I might remind you that I still have some kind of business and social interests of my own . " " Oh , Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time her eyes left the crate and the silent workmen . " Do n't Iet 's quarrel about such a silly thing . dress and go to the stupid dinner if you absolutely insist . But do let me off , just this once . I 've tried so hard , and I ca n't get on with people like that . They do n't like me and I do n't like them . And besides , I ca n't bear to leave the piano like this . I must get it out of the crate and put it up and try it . Please , Martin . " In his old golf clothes and sweater , standing angrily there by the foot of the stairs , Martin Eggleston was a handsome figure of a man . His wife had to look up at him to get his eyes . " You can do exactly as you please , " said Martin . " You will anyway , so what 's the use of talking ? You are the great Lili Strauss , and of course it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what right have I to complain ? I 'm going to drive to Nice and dine with the Mitchells , that 's all . I suppose I can tell them that my celebrated and charming wife could n't come because she has a new tin pan to practice on and ca n't bear to wait until morning . The situation will be nothing new to me . " Lili 's dark brown eyes shone suddenly with the tears which were always so near their surface . " Oh , Martin , dear ! " she said . " Please do n't talk like that ! " " How do you expect me to talk ? " he asked . " Do you think it 's pleasant for a man who , after all , amounts to something in his own way ? " " You know perfectly well that you 're talking nonsense ? " " ? to be put in the position of a prima donna 's poodle-dog ? " Lili suddenly stamped her foot . " Oh , I ca n't stand such talk ! " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resentments , nothing to complain about ? You go off and play golfall afternoon with a stupid Scotch professional who does n't know a thing about anything but strokes and clubs ; and when you come in you do n't ask a single question about me . How have I spent the day ? That 's of no consequence . My piano  --  Borisoglebsky 's piano , willed to me in his will , the most perfect piano in the world  --  is just a tin pant You do n't care what it ist You do n't care anything about me ! All I 'm good for is to dress up in silly clothes and load on jewels and sit and be wretched all evening with your ghastly friends , just to impress them ! Just so that they can tell all their horrible little banker and broker friends that they had dinner with Lili Strauss , and she was this and she was that , and why does she wear that awful bang over her eyes ? , and what Martin sees in her ? " Martin broke in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which covered Lili like cold water . " My friends need not trouble you , " he said . " I do n't want you to go to the dinner . Not now . You would simply insult them all , in one way or another , before the evening was over . You would address not one word to your host and you would refuse to answer the simplest question about your plans or your work . I know that high and mighty manner . My friends may not be world wonders , but they 're too good to subject to that kind of treatment . You can stay at home . With your piano . " He turned to go upstairs , but before he had taken three steps she was after him . She was crying now . " Oh , dearest ! " she said , throwing herself in front of him . " I 'm sorry  --  I 'm so sorry ! I do n't want to be nasty . It 's just that temper of mine , you know . And you know you really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piano . I thought it would be such a lovely surprise for you . " MENAGE A TROIS 589 He took her in his arms and kissed her . " That 's all right , ducky , " he said in a softer voice . " I 'm sorry too . It ca n't be helped . I just got angry . I 'm afraid my temper 's worse than yours , if it comes to that . " She was crying desperately into the soft wool of his sweater . " There , sweetheart , " he whispered into her bushy black hair . " Do n't cry . Please do n't cry . You know I ca n't stand seeing you cry . You do n't have to go to the dinner . Its foolish of me to want you to . I would n't have you go there and be miserable , not for the world . Please , dearest . " She lifted a woebegone face . " Oh , Martin darling , " she said . " I 'll go . I 'd I.1-love to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go and I 'll try to be nice , and answer questions and talk to that awful Mr. Mitchell . You 'll see , dear , how nice I 'll be . " " But I do n't want you to go , sweetheart , " he said , running his fingers through the bushy fringe of hair over her forehead . " It ruins your nerves for twenty-four hours to go to that kind of party . I know it does . It 's stupid of me to want you to be like any little suburban housewife , You are n't that sort of person at all , thank God . And I love you the way you are . " " Do you , sweet ? " she asked of his woolen sweater . " But I love you too and that 's why I 'm going to go ; you 'll see . " She lifted her head tragically , exalted by the thought of the sacrifice she was about to make . " I 'll send theworkmen away at once , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then I 'll get it set up . " She extricated herself from his arms with one swift movement and ran down to the hall . He followed her . " But I do n't want you to , darling , " he protested . " 1 know you 're dying tosee the piano and play on it . I want you to stay and do it . I do n't want you to go to the dinner , honestly I do n't . " " You do n't want me to go to the dinner ? " she demanded , turning back to him again . " Then what on earth has all this been about ? " She paused , fixed her eyes on him , and frowned . " Oh , 1 see , " she said . " You do n't want me to disgrace you That 's it . I 've done it too often , I suppose . You think that because we had this little disagreement I 'll be rude and nervous at dinner , and your precious Mitchells will wonder again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it ? " " No , that is n't it , " he said impatiently . " Will you never get anything straight ? I do n't want you to go because I realize that you 'd be miserable . I do n't want to make you miserable . If you 'd rather be here with this damned piano , then I think you ought to stay . " " This damned piano ! " she echoed . " Do you realize that this is one of the most beautiful pianos I 've ever heard in my life ? It was built for Borisoglebsky , and his hands were almost exactly the same shape and size as mine , and . . . Oh , Martin , what 's the use ? " She leaned her head against the side of the crate , and the tears shone again on her cheekbones . " All right , dear , " said Martin quietly . " Please do n't be disturbed . I 'll run up and dress and get off to the dinner . Do n't worry . Everything 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears away and left her there . She did not speak again , and until he disappeared at the top of the stairs she stood with her head leaning against the side of the crate . Then , as if for the first time , she became aware of the four French workmen . They had gathered in a clump , stolid but fascinated , watching her . Nothing in this house was likely to surprise them , since its inhabitants were not only American but musical . Their interest was none the less keen , and Lili realized what a pretty story would be told in the village caf  --  s that night . " Eh , bien , " she said . " Ddbrouillez-vow ! " She began to move about briskly , giving directions , ringing bells , sending for newspapers to put down on the floor , impressing upon the workmen the need for great care . When Martin came downstairs ten minutes later , dressed for dinner , she was too busy to give him more than a glance . " Quick work , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You dress quicker than anybody in the world . Should have been an actor . Have a nice time , dear . " He was gone , and as she supervised the first blow of the hammer on the framework of the crate she heard , out in the courtyard , the roar of his motor getting off in a great hurry . She did not think of it , or of him ; she was almost breathless with anxiety lest a careless blow might somehow injure the precious freight inside that wooden box . " Oh , prenez garde , prenez garde . ' " she said to the workmen , standing on the tips of her toes as if to see better what was directly before her eyes . In less than an hour the work was completed , and the lovely thing emerged from its straw and cotton wool , intact , exquisite , its smooth lovely walnut legs lying on the floor , ready to be put on . She ran her bands over the surface of the wood , and the mere touch of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful thing ! " You must be very careful , " she said . " We are going to move it now , into the music room , and set it up . Jean , you will have to help the workmen . Now do he very careful . If you drop it I shall bring the house down onyour heads . Careful ! Careful ! Move slowly ! " At last it was set up . She was almost out of her mind with delight . Jean , her butler , respectfully suggested that she might now have some dinner ; it was already ten o'clock and Madame had eaten nothing since noon . But Madame was not hungry . " Clear out all the debris in the hall , " she said , " and pay these men . Perhaps later on I may eat . You might have some sandwiches made ; Monsieur might like them when he returns . And put a pint of champagne on ice . If the piano is all I hope it may be perhaps I shall drink a glass of champagne . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely instrument almost in fear . It seemed too good to be true that this piano , which she had touched once years ago in Borisoglebsky 's studio and dreamed about ever since , was now to be her own for ever . Borisoglebsky had been a virtuoso with phenomenally small hands , almost exactly the size and shape of her own . For him , before the War , a famous German piano-builder had constructed this perfect instrument . It had a slightly shortened keyboard without any loss of beauty or power . The tops of the black keys were slightly rounded , so as to make the rapid movements of brilliant passages somewhat less difficult for a small hand . A pianist with a different sort of hand would have had trouble playing on it . But for Lib Strauss . . She unclasped her fingers nervously and sat down at the instrument . It had been placed at the end of the huge room she used as a studio . Martin Eggleston did things well ; when he decided to spend his and his wife 's vacation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was the largest room in the house , and with a proper disposition of rugs and furniture the echo from stone walls had been conquered , and all music sounded clear and round within it . The other piano  --  Lili 's own piano , a very good one too , in its way  --  had been moved to the side of the huge room , where it stood gloomily now like a discarded lover . It was mahogany , and its warm shining surface had not the majestic beauty of the black , black walnut . Lill tried the pedals first . They felt all right . The piano had not had far to go  --  Borisoglebsky 's place was near Monte Carlo . With hick the instrument might be in almost perfect pitch . Lili thought nothing of tuning a piano herself ; she had always held that a pianist ought to be able to do anything short of actually building an instrument ; but she would never have dreamed of attempting to tune this one . She would get the man up from Nice in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out her hands over the keys , held her breath for a second , and then struck a chord . It sounded full and strong , exactly in tune . Then another and another , rhyming the octaves , while her head was ringing with the beauty of the sound . There were a few notes in the extreme bass and a few in the extreme treble which seemed to have slipped a bit , but only a bit . For the greater part of its compass it was nobly , splendidly , precisely right . She drew a long breath and shook her hair back . " Divine ! " she said out loud , addressing the instrument . " Divine , divine piano ! Oh , beautiful , beautiful , beau-tiful ! " For a long while she sat there contemplating it , thinking of Borisoglebsky and the things he had played on this keyboard and of the marvelous hands this keyboard had known . A weird creature , Borisoglebsky  --  rude , self-satisfied , almost impossible for any human being to endure , but a superbpianist ; how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whom he had scarcely known and never Liked ! It was because of her hands , she knew ; they had measured hands once , and hers were almost exactly like his . He had resented this bitterly at the time , because she was a woman  --  denied it even , in the face of the plain fact . But in his last illness he had been too good an artist to deny the truth . A piano belongs to the hands that can play it , she thought ; Borisoglebsky on his deathbed had known this fact . Nobody else in the world could rightly inherit this piano , whatever the laws or conventions of mankind might say . A piano belongs to the hands that can play it . She rubbed her hands together and began to play . At first she played hard , brisk modern things , and the staccato was a delight . Then , to see how its tone accommodated itself to other moods , she played romantic music , Chopin and Liszt and Schumann . She had no idea how long she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay her devoirs to the master she loved above all others , Bach . She had worked her way nearly half through the " Well Tempered Clavichord " when a cough behind her brought her to a stop . She looked up , frowning . Martin had come into the room and stood looking at her . " Oh , hello , dear , " she said . " Does n't it sound divine ? I could n't believe it at first , but it 's scarcely out of tune at all . I think a few notes high up have slipped , and maybe a few in the deep bass , but all the rest . . . What 's the matter ? " Have you been playing that thing all night long ? " he asked . " It 's damn ' near two o'clock . Do you know that ? " She rose hastily , moved toward him . " Oh , dear , " she said . " That 's silly of me , is n't it ? Perhaps I ought to eat something . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you have a nice evening , dear ? " " No , " he said , taking off his coat and scarf and dropping them on a chair . " It was all right , but they all missed you and asked a lot of questions . I do think you might have made an effort this once to come . There were two or three men there who count a good deal in business at home , and their wives all wanted to see you . " " What 's wrong with the man ? " she asked , addressing the furniture . " I offered to go to his stupid dinner , and he would n't let met " " Well , it was only because you obviously would have hated it , " he said . " But just the same , it was a disappointment to them . There was a woman who plays the piano , wife of one of the directors of the company . Nice woman , too . She was crushed because you did n't come . Where are the sandwiches ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , leading the way . " Oh , I know these wives of the directors of the company ! I know just how they play the piano too . If you 'd wanted to convince me I was right to stay away , that was the thing to tell me . Ugh ! " The sandwiches , instead of being in the dining room , stood on a table near the shadowy door of the studio . Beside them was a bucket of ice with a pint bottle in it . " Open the champagne , Martin , " she said . " Will you please ? I want to christen my piano . I ca n't tell you how lovely it is . I never dreamed I could ever have anything so lovely . " " I suppose so , " he said . " But you ca n't expect me to be in a state of high fever about it . After all , a man does expect certain common or garden social things from his wife , and it 's pretty hard to be cheated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here 's your wine . " She took the wineglass and walked dreamily over toward the black piano . " Here 's to you , " she said . " My beautiful piano ! " She drank the whole glass of champagne and held it aloft , as for a toast . " Honestly , " he said , " you are absurd , Lill . Do n't you know you 're absurd ? Have you no sense of humor ? You talk to that thing as if it were human . ' Mybeautiful piano , ' indeed ! My beautiful fiddlesticks ! You musical people all talk like impossible characters in a bad play . " " Oh , yes , of course , " she said . " Pose . Is that it ? Pose . A handy word to use for something you do n't understand . My dear , have you made the slightest effort to get it through your handsome wooden head what that piano means to me ? This is one of the happiest days of my life . Perhaps the happiest . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no idea what a difference it will make in my playing , " she said . " I shall take it on my American tour next month , and to Australia after that . " " Oh , so you 're going to Australia ? " he said . " I thought we had decided against that . After all , Lili , you 're married to me . " " I know , " she said . " You remind me often enough . And I 'm glad I 'm married to you . But does that mean that I 've got to sit in New York or Detroit and go to dinner with the potentates of your business for the rest of my life ? The Australian offer is a very good one , and I 've never been there . " " I thought I had been reasonable enough , " he said . " I have always agreed that you should continue your career . For three months out of every year you go on tour and play for everybody from Maine to California who can buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood , head down , munching a sandwich . Her hair was dishevelled and there were smudges on her face . She still wore the red skirt and old sweater of the afternoon . He watched her through a long silence . " Lili , " he said , " why did you marry me ? We 've been married four years and I still do n't know . " She looked up and smiled . " Oh , Martin , " she said softly . " You 're an idiot . Why did I marry you , is it ? Well , how do I know ? I loved you , I suppose  --  and still do . I do n't know why we have to quarrel all the time . " He shook his head suddenly ; she thought he might have done it to keep tears from coming in his eyes , and she marvelled . Such a thing had never happened before . " Lili , dear , " he began in a rather clouded voice . Then he cleared his throat and turned away . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irritably . " Why ca n't that man learn to put out whiskey and soda at night ? I ca n't drink champagne  --  hate the stuff , as I tell him every day . " " It 's in the dining room , dear , " she said . " I 'll get it for you . " She ran into the dining room quickly and was back in two minutes with a bottle of whiskey and a siphon . " Here it is , " she said . " Now how 's that for the dutiful wife ? Are n't I the little woman ? " " Yes , " he said , " except that I ca n't drink out of the bottle . Are there no glasses in this house ? " She put the bottle and siphon down on the table and reached for her wineglass . " There are , " she said coolly , " and you know where they are . You can get one yourself . I 'm not used to being spoken to like that " He was out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She sipped a little wine and went over to the piano . She heard him come in behind her and mix his drink . " Martin , " she said , " I realize that it 's two in the morning and you 're tired from golf and that stupid party , andyou do n't like music much anyway , and you hate my beautiful piano , but you used to like to hear me play . Would n't you like to hear something  --  just some little thing , so that you 'll know what it sounds like ? " " All right , " he said after a pause . She sat down and played . After she had passed the first few notes she had forgotten Martin completely . She was no longer playing for him at all ; she was playing as she had played all night , for her piano . After a time  --  it must have been rather a long time , since she had actually played a Chopin waltz and two movements of a sonata  --  she became conscious of Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , with his hand gripped on the edge of the instrument just above the strings . She stopped at once . " I wondered if you were going on all night , " he said grimly . " Had you by any chance forgotten that I was here ? " " Oh , dear , oh , dear , " she said , stretching her hands out toward him over the top of the piano , over the strings . " Martin , what is it ? What 's the trouble ? " There was plain misery in his eyes . " How do I know ? " he said . " It 's this  --  this piano . It 's everything . Us . It 's terrible , Lili . It 's terrible . " Martin was not given to gestures , but unhappiness touches strange springs ; his arms flew out suddenly , wide , hopeless . And his right arm , sweeping into the prop which held up the top of the piano , knocked it away in a second . The whole black top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jumped to hold it . He did not dare look toward Lili : her fingers had been stretched out there , over the strings , directly under the top of the piano . . . He groaned , lifted his head , and looked at her . She sat very quietly , looking at her hands . They were spread out on the edge of the front-piece , untouched . She had jerked them away in time . Now she sat looking at them contemplatively , frowning . He did not dare speak . After a long time she got up . " I think that will do , Martin , " she said . " I think that will do . " She walked down the room , holding her hands one with the other . They had not been touched ; he knew that . But they might have been , and he could see she was walking almost like a somnambulist , strangely , rigid with horror . " Lili , " he said in a whisper . He did not dare raise his voice . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had addressed her in the street . " My hands , " she said , " might have been broken . Smashed . I think that we have nothing more to talk about , Martin . You can arrange the details as you please , but that is that . Finished . All over . It was a mistake anyway . I know that now . Good-by . " " Lili ! " he said , but she did not stop . She went out into the hall and up the stairs . He dropped his elbows on the piano , and held his head tight with his hands . In the morning Martin came downstairs fresh , shaved , bathed , a little defiant . It was nine o'clock ; the great salon was filled with sunlight . At the end of the room Lili sat , dressed in a brown wool skirt and bright blue sweater , playing the piano . Her black bushy hair tossed as she finished whatshe was playing , finished with a great thundering crash of octaves across the keyboard . " Hello , Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it wonderful ? It 's just as wonderful this morning as it was last night ! Have you had breakfast ? " " Yes , darling , " he said . " What 's wonderful ? " " The piano , you goose ! Now do n't begin to be tiresome again . What are you going to do this morning ? " " I thought I might get in a little golf over at the club , " he said . " Scotty is pretty good , you know . " She made a slight dissatisfied noise , a thread of sound through her nose . He was watching her . His calm gray eyes were curious . " Lili , " he said , " what about that momentous decision ? " " Decision ? " she echoed , wrinkling her brows under their fringe of black . " Oh , that ! Now , really , Martin , you should n't begin to argue so early in the morning . You know it makes my head ache . " " All right , pigeon , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour later he was off to the golf club . She heard the roar of his motor as she turned back into the room and walked toward the piano . It stood black and proud there under the morning sun . As Martin 's motor grew inaudible in the distance she touched the gleaming surface gently  --  touched it with hands of love .
