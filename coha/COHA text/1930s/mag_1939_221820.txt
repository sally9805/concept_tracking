On his way to San Francisco for the convention of the American Newspaper Guild , of which he is president , Columnist Heywood Broun last week took a sideswipe at the employer who is soon to unemploy him . Said he : <P> " I do n't want to stir up any bitter feeling about foreign nations lying to the west of us , but I do say that I would regret to see further aggression on the part of a nation all of whose admirals and generals seem to look precisely like Roy W. Howard . " <P> Last fortnight Columnist Broun advertised for a job ( TIME , July 31 ) , thereby publicly setting himself up as the No. 1 example of an oldtime newspaperman whose career has followed the conventional graph ( reporter to critic to columnist ) and who now needs work . There are thousands like him , for the number of U. S. daily newspapers had decreased by 211 in a decade . Time was when a good man could always get a job and the itinerant newspaperman was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard-drinking , amorous , industrious when sober , able whether sober or drunk . Today these footloose reporters and copyreaders have nearly all died or settled down . The old timers who are left look back with nostalgia on the gaudier days of their profession , but stick to their jobs if they have jobs . Luckier than Newspaperman Broun last week were these hoary and , in their spheres , famed and typical oldtimers : <P> Police Reporter Kenneth George Bellairs returned from his vacation to the St. Louis police department , which he has covered , off &; on , for one paper or another , since 1891 . Son of a British Army captain who came to the U. S. to grow beans and ran the St. Louis zoo instead , Jock Bellairs went to work for the old St. Louis Globe in 1890 , when he was 21 . He left the Globe for the Chronicle , left the Chronicle for the Post-Dispatch , left the Post-Dispatch to return to the Star-Chronicle , which , as the Star-Times , now pays him his salary . Sitting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reporter Bellairs heard four bombs go off , the Chronicle 's signal to the city that the Spanish-American War had started . Said he jokingly : " In a few minutes the phone will ring and it 'll be Tarbell telling me that I 'm to cover the war . " In a few minutes the phone did ring and Managing Editor David Tarbell told surprised Jock Bellairs that he was to cover the war . Correspondent Bellairs scooped Richard Harding Davis and many another prima donna on the attack on the U. S. torpedo-boat Winslow , returned to St. Louis a newspaperman 's hero , went back to covering police . Around him have been woven some of the best-known newspaper apocrypha of that newspaperman 's town . Samples : <P> &gt;Bellairs and his colleagues on the police beat used to accost farmers bringing produce to the city , demand a license for each separate vegetable , give the frightened farmers mock trials in the press room at headquarters , fine them , buy whiskey with the booty . <P> &gt;Bellairs &; friends once borrowed the corpse of a Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered plenty of drinks , left the Chinese to pay the bill . The bartender shook the Chinese to awaken him , knocked him down , tried desperately to hide the body while Bellairs &; Co. , peering through the window , howled with ribald glee .
