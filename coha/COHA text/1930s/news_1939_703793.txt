txt CURING ' METRO-MANIA ' Union Professor Has Plan for Record-Minded Track ' Bugs ' To Sports Editor of The New York Times : My subject is " A Cure for MetroMania ? " This does not , as you might suspect , concern the enthusiastic riders on the Paris subway or even the admirers of M-G-M pictures , but rather the members of that species of indoor track bugs who expect ( nay , who demand ) new records at every performance . Such metro-maniacs consider that evening lost which sees only a few close races in poorer-than-record times . This has led track promoters to organize their meets around bigname stars , to go in for trick distances , to speed up the indoor tracks by fancy banking , springier materials and the elimination of turns . Right now they are squirming at the report that Dartmouth has built a streamlined saucer that is several seconds faster than any other in the country . Record-breaking threatens to become a mpnopoly of the wilds of Hanover ; and then where shall we be ? All of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when has that fact ever cured a sports addict ? Fighting Fire With Fire But doctors and General Electric research men have developed the technique of the artificial fever as the cure of many diseases and maybe this suggestion will raise the temperature of the metro-maniacs to the point of either complete insanity or recovery . Why not run indoor track meets for a while on the space as well as the time basis ? One sure way to break records frequently , for a few years anyhow , would be to see how far a man can run in a given time , instead of which man can run a given distance in the fewest seconds . On this plan , a meet would consist , perhaps , of the six-second , oneminute , two-minute , four-minute and eight-minute events . To break a record , a runner would only have to exceed , in the given time allowed , the previous mark by a full stride . Cameras set to click at the end of the allotted time could easily settle disputes . Gun at Start  --  and Finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a state of hysteria until the gun , which would end , as well as begin , each race . You can see those headlines now : " Cunningham Breaks Four-Minute Mark by Six More Feet ! " After all , the whole business is just a matter of playing off time against space , or space against time . To see ' a man get across a line by a visible margin would be far more understandable than to wait for a posse of judges to consult tenth-second watches . Come on , metro-maniacs ! Here are yards more of rope wherewith to hang yourselves . Do n't say you were n't incited to riot ! HAROLD A. LARRABRE . Professor of Philosophy , Union College , Schnectady , N. Y. , Jan. 28 , 1939 . Editorial Note : It 's an interesting suggestion , but the judges at the finish would have to be on roller skates to be at the right place at the right time . But that might make the program just that much more spectacular . Are Writers Wrong on Louis ? To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports writers are telling us that Joe Louis is the greatest heavyweight fighter of all time . That 's exactly what they were saying some three years ago , much to their embarrassment in June , 1936 . What kind of an individual is a sports writer ? Does n't he ever learn ? I personally do not know whether Louis , is or is n't the greatest heavyweight fighter of all time . Maybe he is and maybe he is n't . Certainly his knockout victory over John Henry Lewis does n't make him that . Frankly , I wonder what does in the minds of the sports writers . The fight at Madison Square Garden Wednesday night was a " crime " in my opinion . Where was our famous boxing commission ? John Kieran 's column on " hindsight " and " foresight " made me smile . Why all this ballyhoo about Joe Louis ? Why is the public being made a sucker of again ? Perhaps because there were only some 17 , - 000-odd suckers on Wednesday night ? there must be 70,000 or 80,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdoors . Bah ! - Sports writers ( those who qualify ) make me sick . KARL KABLSON Forest Hills , L. Jan. 30 , 1939 . Editorial Note : With regard to the rating of Joe Louis as the greatest heavyweight fighter of history , the correspondent states : " Maybe he is and maybe he is n't . " If it 's that dubious , the registered opinions of others that Louis is the greatest should not cause intense irritation and undue excitement . IN SUPPORT OF HOLMAN Nat 's Strategy Upheld by Fans , Who Cite His Brilliant Record To sports Editor of The New York Times : In last VFeek 's letters , J. F. X. C. would have us believe that C. C. N. Y. lost the St. John 's game because Nat Holman outsmarted himself by removing his regulars and inserting substitutes when they were leading 26-21 with eight minutes to go . I am sure it was apparent to most of the spectators that the C. C. N. Y. team was almost exhausted at that point and was in dire need of a rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to tire out the Redmen and the substitutes did this with amazing passing skill , meanwhile giving the first team a rest . Is n't it wiser to give your players a rest when they are winning instead of resting them when they are losing at a crucial stage of the game ? I think that even the " oldtimers " will nod affirmatively . The momentum of the St. John 's team was so great that it scored the magnificent total of one point on a deftly executed foul shot . St. . John 's points were scored on the varsity and any defensive faults must be placed on the shoulders of the regulars and not the substitutes . By his arguments , J. F. X. C. leads me to believe that the better team lost . Nevertheless , St. John 's has an excellent team . There can be no doubt of that  --  even though it lost to DePaul due , of course , to Dolgoff 's illness and an off night for most of the regulars . AARON GREENFELD , C.C.N.Y. , ' 41 . New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Teams To Sports Editor of The New York Times : I wonder if J. F. X. C. is not a bit hasty in detracting from the recognized achievements of Nat Holman . C. C. N. Y : , because it has few inducements to offer and high entrance requirements , gets only skimmed milk as far as basketball talent is concerned but , through the sheer coaching wizardry of Holman , turns out strong teams each year just the same . We have seen the St. John 's " Wonder Five " and we have seen some rather mediocre teams from Brooklyn , determined as I see it by the cycle of stars who have served with the Redmen . This is a good St. John 's team , but , without Dolgoff , see what happened to it . Such could never happen at C. C. N. Y. Nat Holman seldom is faced by the prospect of a demoralized team through the loss of a star , for he rarely obtains the services of an outstanding performer and , furthermore , concentrates on the development of team play . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Editorial Note : Other letters , too numerous to publish , arrived in defense of Coach Holman , who perhaps needs no defense , anyway . Swarthmore 's Strong Quintet To Sports Editor of The New York Times : I would like to call your attention to a top-notch basketball team that few people seem to know anything about . That is the quintet or Swarthmore College . Swarthmore 's record is impressive . The team has won its last twenty games and has averaged well over fifty points a game on this streak . It seems that the only drawback is the lack of good opposition , but I am told that the big schools refuse to play Swarthmore . Nevertheless , I feel sure Swarthmore is heading for a high place in the ranking of college basketball teams . N. H. New York , Jan. 29 , 1939 . BALM FOR DR . NAISMITH Former C.C.N.Y. Captain Views Zone Defense as Aid to Game To Sports Editor Of The New York Times : I read with interest the recent speech of Dr. James Naismith wherein he deplored the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ruled out . As C. C. N. Y. basketball captain of 1919-20 , may I refer Dr. Naismith to some basketball history ? I would like to remind the father of basketball that zone defenses are as old as the game itself . Joe Deering , my first coach at C. C. N. Y. , taught only the zone defense . For several years under Deering , C. C. N. Y. held its opponents to an average of 15 points a game by Using a zone . It was only when Nat Holman became coach in 1919 that we took up the man-to-man defense . On the other hand , under both Deering and Holman , C. C. N. Y. repeatedly demonstrated its ability to penetrate a zone defense when it had the ball . It is merely a question of developing a sound offensive system . The fact that college teams today have difficulty in breaking through the zone defense should not be counted against that alignment but rather against the skill of the players and perhaps also the skill of the coaches . Do n't be alarmed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the , zone defense will be broken through by good players and good coaches just as it has been broken through in the past . The offense is too strong and there is too much scoring in basketball , anyway . The defense should be str &gthened; to equalize the game . The use of the zone strengthens the defense and also develops better basketball players in the interest of better basketball . HY FLIEGEL . New York , Feb. 1 , 1939 . Challenges Foreign Choppers To Sports Editor of The New York Times : John Kieran 's article " Woodchopper Chin , " in today 's TIMES contained some brief notes which caused me to take down " my own axe to grind it . " In the first place , we have our own collection of fancy choppers , so why import " foreign stuff " ? The boys hold some pretty powerful pow-wows out in Portland , Oregon , every year . I wonder if Mr. Greenwood-Adams recollects our tall " brush " out West . Even so , his description of " topping " is somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it is out West but there in the tall timber spars are topped by a climber . Furthermore , they do n't stand on springboards , but use cleats and waist cable . Springboard felling is reserved for big timber . However , the idea of an exhibition is . a swell one . We here in New York had a taste of it at the last Sportsman 's Show . Why not , though , organize an American team to meet the " bushwackers " ? IRA A. Lima New York , Jan. 28 , 1939 . A Word From a Witness To Sports Editor of The New York Times : Let me add my second to Mr. Greenwood-Adams 's recommendation for a showing to this generation " of the great exhibition of the Australian woodchopping act . I had the honor of witnessing that grand old pair , McClaren and Jackson , at the old Lincoln Square Theatre in New York , not only as a most interested spectator but as a member of the supporting castfor , a short time . The quartet of which I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then return to the stage to provide background and also applause for the choppers . Well , the songs were foreign and we had little time to rehearse , so they cut us off and rushed the woodchoppers on in a hurry . What a show ! What an act ! And to make matters worse we forgot to applaud , but stood like the goofs we were with mouths agape and eyes agog . The woodchoppers had a long run , but we were forthwith chased . No , we did n't even get paid . Oh , well FRANCIS TYLER . Hollis , L. I. , Jan. 29 , 1939 . Editorial Note : Let the chips fall where they may !
