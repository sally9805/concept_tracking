The American Dnieperstroy WHEN I crossed southern Colorado from east to west a few days ago , my train , dropping several thousand feet from the top of the transcontinental divide in the course of a few miles , wound downward through a canyon beside the bed of an insignificant , an inconsequential river , trickling along in an amiable and unimportant way . Days later and hundreds of miles distant I met the same river again , now become the lordly Colorado , whose course , carved at one point through a , vertical mile of colored rock , provides the Grand Canyon , the most awesome single spectacle in the whole world ? the Colorado , which in flood has in the past wreaked incalculable damage but ( if the engineers ' plans do not miscarry ) will never do so again ; will on the contrary be of tremendous use ful- nesa to that part of the human anthill which lies within a vast circle whose central point is a few hundred miles from the river 's mouth in the Lower California Gulf . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Las Vegas , Nevada ( of Which more in a moment ) . For two-thirds of its length the road runs straight across the semi-desert upland through sparse and stunted vegetation ; then You twist upward and to the left amid . barren small hills . You pass a harrier where a uniformed representative of Uncle Sam looks 1 ' 01.1 over ( and politely turns you back if you happen to be unemployed and looking for work ) , and in a twinkling here you are In Boulder City . A few years ago this was bare desert , without a tree or a teaspoonful of water ; nowit is a pleasant community of curving e-boul yards along the hillsides , bastard-Mediterranean architecture , green lawns , palms and bright flower beds . The men who arc making the dam live here in big air-cooled dormitories , traveling to and from the dam itself , a few miles away , in huge buses . As many as 5,000 persons have been employed simultaneously , though with the end of the job perhaps only eighteen months away the number is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , swing and graveyard ; they cat in a huge restaurant whose staff tosses off lightly the task of preparing up to 10,000 " sit down " meals and 5,000 box lunches every day . The work is exceedingly hard , often dangerous , and not particularly well paid ; the average payroll works out at about $35 per week per person , which , in view of the many highly skilled men who get more than this , means that large numbers get less . Nevertheless , in several ways the workers here have had unusually good conditions ? including the air-cooled sleeping rooms in a climate where the summer temperature often goes above 120 degrees ( I have seen it myself at 127 ) . The men 's living quarters reminded me strongly of conditions in an average dormitory for men in a Western college ; and when I mentioned this 1 was told that in fact a large proportion of the workers had been college men who , because of the vagaries of our economic system , had been unable to get jobs more appropriate to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher into the hills , a few miles on winding mountain roads ; a long and sharp descent with a hairpin turn , and here you are , a quarter of a mile downstream from the dam . At this spot a few . years ago the river roared and hissed at the bottom of a deep notch cut between ugly , tumbled , black hills , with hardly a blade of vegetation on their sharp-edged shoulders of volcanic material . Men came and clambered over the rocks , squinted far down at the green and white water against the black , deeply shadowed walls , and this is what they have done : they have built vast tunnels through the canyon walls , paralleling the course of the mighty stream ; they have turned the water out of its bed ; in that dry bed they have constructed by far the largest dam on earth , six hundred feet through at the base and towering almost two-thirds as high as the Empire State Building . Upstream from that dam is now accumulating a lake which will take ten Years to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 miles wide at its widest point , and it will contain enough water to cover all of New York State to a depth of one foot . If by some miracle of nature the river itself were to disappear from the face of the earth , its mighty current would continue to sweep onward at the normal volume for two years before this lake would be exhausted . What you see as you come around that hairpin turn is a vast wall of new , gray-white concrete , curved in a beautiful bow with its arch upstream for strength . Just beyond it arc four concrete towers which look " modern " because they arc functional ? two on either side of the dam , close inshore ? the intake towers through which will pass the water for the hydro-electric plant . That plant will lie nestled against the downstream side of the dam , a U-shaped structure which in fact will be twenty stories high but will , I should say , look like a pygmy beside the flank of that incredible man-made mountain . At present , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appalling litter that goes with big construction ? temporary roads , wooden scaffolding , a tangle of power-cables . Even from our height , a little below the top of the dam itself , the workers moving about amid their rubbish heaps seem incredibly small and weak ; the mind refuses to grasp the fact that these tiny dolls and others like them have actually turned aside the river , built that vast cliff of concrete , chiseled and blasted out all these roads , many of them cut into the very face of the cliff , bored the mighty tunnels through which the entire river is now racing silently , far below our feet in the bowels of the bill . Abstractedly , as we sec huge cages move out on cables strung across the canyon , and then descend 700 feet with their massive cargoes , we hear the Voice of Explanation in our cars : The purposes of Boulder Dam are flood control , irrigation , silt control , water supply and electricity . The new aqueduct , many miles downstream , will carry one billion gallons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 239 miles , over desert and through mountains , lifting it a quarter of a mile , by means of pumping stations , in the process . Still farther downstream , a new irrigation canal will carry water to 1,000,000 acres and ultimately to 500,000 more . In addition , flood danger will be eliminated from another vast area . The dam , when completed , will have a maximum electric capacity four times that of Niagara , three times that of Muscle Shoals , two and one-half times that of the great Russian dam which was once called Dnieperstroy . The sale of electricity and Nvatcr should pay the expense of construction within about fifty years ( the aqueduct will cost sonic $60,000,000 more than the dam itself , and is next only to the Panama Canal among the great projects of the modern world ) . The dam is by far the largest single piece of masonry ever attempted . It weighs 6,000,000 tons , and if this were poured in a cube , it would cover a square block and rise higher than the Empire State Building . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take a hundred years to cool , if left to itself . To hasten the process , more than 500 miles of tubing have been built into the structure , through which ice water circulates from a plant capable of turning out 1,000 tons of ice every twenty-four hours ( compare that with your electric refrigerator ) . This dam , which is being built by a combination of private companies , was first tailor-made in the Denver offices of the Reclamation Service , where the plans were all drawn . The actual construction , of course , was mostly done on the spot . Before construction could begin , a branch railroad had to be built thirty-three miles in length ; many miles of first-class highway were constructed and , oddly enough , a power-line 222 miles long was strung to bring electricity , for the building job , to the place which will ultimately produce the world 's largest supply of it . The top of the dam is broad enough for a roadway , and is already used for that purpose . Eventually , the main highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tin-can tourists rattling along at fifty miles an hour toward the Coast will glance down casually at the lake on the right , the river resuming its flow on the left . Probably few of them will ponder very much about the 6,000,000 hours of heart-breaking , risky work performed here by steel-helmeted men in overalls , who , the task completed , have gone their anonymous way toward the next job . Where 's that road-map , Mary ? Well , why 'd you let the baby have it , anyhow ? It says bear left at Las Vegas ? that 's funny , I thought that town was in New Mexico . Anyhow , step on it ; here 's a swell stretch , and we ought to get to Barstow by dinnertime . Worm's-Eve l'iew. ? M V friend Buddy the chauffeur , tearing down a winding mountain road , deposes and says : The brakes on this car are all shot . Hope you do n't mind ? I can most always hold her by going into second gear . Sure , I worked on the dam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it one time or another , or anyhow tried CI . Men came here from pretty near everywhercs , ' specially a couple years ago when it was just getting started . Lots of them were hired , and then got in the cage for their first trip down . You seen it : the cage goes out over the canyon , 700 feet high and then in the middle it goes on down . Lots of men could n't stand it . They 'd hang onto the cage and ride back up on the first trip and quit right there . Good many men been killed here . What do you expect ? It 's dangerous work . Do n't know exactly how many , but it must be close to 200 . Quite a lot of them fell . A fellow was running the hoist that pulls the cage up and down on the cables . One time he was bringing up a cage with three men in it , and when it got to the top he forgot to pull the lever . The hoist wheels went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cage dropped . Sure , all killed . Did they fire the hoistruan ? Say , they never caught him to fire him . Anybody that gets in an accident like that , he lights out for all hell and you never see him again . Used to be a cable bridge across the river ? also 700 feet up . Floor was two planks , each twelve inches wide , no handrail or nothing . Many a man come here , took one look at that bridge and quit . Sometimes somebody would start to walk across , standing up , of course , and leaning against the wind . Then he 'd look down , or get thinking about it , and lose his nerve . He 'd drop to all fours , hugging them planks , and crawl off an inch at a time . When two of you met , walking from opposite sides , you 'd take hold of hands , swing out and past each other , straighten up and let go of hands again . One fellow got scared in the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they strung another cable for a sort of handrail . Was n't much good , though ; kept hitting you in the leg as you walked and you 'd conic off of there all black and blue . A fellow was sitting in a painter 's chair , hung down over the side of the dam , ' bout twenty-five feet from the top . He looked up and seen a man slip and come down , over the edge . Son of a gun if he did n't kick the face of the darn , swing out and catch the guy right in the air . Saved his life . Tore his coat though . And then the man he caught turned out to be a supervisor . Son of a gun ! It 's funny about them hoistrnen . Even when they are just running a cage out and down , up and in , they differ a lot . You 'd get so you 'd know who was at the levers , just from his style . You seen them big buckets to carry wet concrete ; did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stuff through ? Course , when she empties , the bucket jumps up a little with the weight off . This fellow Smitty. now , he could jerk the lever so when she bounced , she Nobody else could do it . come up twenty-five feet . He could unload ten buckets to anybody else 's nine , right along . The other men said it was the helpers he had , but Smitty saki No , they could give him any helpers they wanted , and he 'd still beat them . Did , too . Well , I missed that truck . Guess you thought I was going to hit , did n't you ? I 'll have to have somebody look at these brakes and see if they ca n't be fixed . Wide-open Toren.  - -  So far as anyone can discern from casual observation , the only occupations of Las Vegas , Nevada , are drinking , gambling and prostitution . They must do something else there , but if so it is not discernible to the innocent tourist 's eye . Probably the dam , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though old inhabitants tell me that Las Vegas has always been one of the most wide-open towns in a wide-open state . It is a bit startling , at first , to walk down the main street at eleven A.M. and see in almost every block one or more gambling houses , doors open to every passerby , crowded with men and women , old and young , playing Keno , roulette , poker , shooting craps , Or betting on horse races described by a raucous-voiced gentleman who gets his facts by direct wire from the track . Las Vegas ' Painted Ladies go in for raspberry-colored sailor pants , coral-tinted blouses and high-heeled slippers ; their faces , beneath the metallic-looking orange rouge which is universal in the Southwest , are haggard and burned like the faces of all desert people . Every second Or third man you meet has had about three drinks too many , and is glad of it . The ladies , as always , drink less or hold it better , and obligingly help keep their genTmen friends from rolling into the gutters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going in for sin in a Big Way , as Las Vegas does , seems to me a pretty awful spectacle . It is carrying g over the habits of the old West into an era of long-distance buses , radio sets and ubiquitous Ford V-8s . The cowhand or miner who once got to town on an occasional Saturday night now can , and apparently does , come in and raise hell any odd Tuesday morning that he feels like it , and whatever glamor there once was to the business of buying excitement has departed . ( A Western friend to whom I said this , replied : " You 're just kidding yourself . There never was any glamor , except in Wild West novels . " ) Probably I am being both unfair and sentimental , but I found myself making comparisons between Boulder City and Las Vegas , to the disadvantage of the latter . Boulder City was built and is still largely controlled by the federal government , and it has none of the things of which its rival has so many too many . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City 's necessary slum , you still ca n't help feeling that in this place private industry shows itself in one of its less savory forms , and that Messrs . Herbert Hoover and Ogden Mills would help their general case if they could somehow whisk it away .
