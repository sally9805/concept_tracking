txt Stabilized factory prices of agricultural machinery , an increase in the farm income through higher prices for livestock , and a let-up in deflation in rural credit are three encouraging factors contributing to_the the farm equipment outlook . Reduction of any major proportion in the prices of farm equipment by the manufacturers during the . present year is now considered unlikely . Requests from dealers and farmers for a scaling down of power farming costs have subsided considerably in the past few months and the attitude taken by the industry on the question has assumed a somewhat firmer tone The more resigned viewpoint of the distributors and users of agricultural machinery has been brought about , in part at least , by educational methods employed by the industry . Pamphlets released recently , as well as speeches made by leading representatives of the group , have dealt with the relative cost of farm equipment production and other interlocking factors , which stress the inability of a price cut under present circumstances . Leg-ge'w Statement on Prices Prominent in this respect was a statement made earlier in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who , speaking before the retail trade , said : " Dealers and manufacturers alike generallyrecognize the need of a better spread or margin in the farm equipment business . especially for the retailer . but under conditions as they exist today , there is little hope for relief for the dealer in the way of reduced prices from the manufacturer . . . . The manufacturer is keenly interested in going as far as he can along that line , but I see little prospect that he can afford any substantial price relief to the dealer and still remain solvent . " Added to the obvious benefits to he derived by the various companies through stabilization of factory prices of farm equipment are two indications of improvement in rural purchasing power , the revival of which is essential to a pick-up in sales of agricultural machinery . Livestock Bringing Better Prices First of these is the substantial increase in prevailing prices for livestock which constitutes a surprisingly large proportion of the farm income .

Accompanying the upswing in rural income is an equally encouraging indication of a betterment in the agricultural banking situation Latter factor is expressed in the let-up in the deflation of credit in small cities nod country districts as indicated by the stability during the past four weeks ( contrary to the usual trend at this time of the year ) of reserve - ieposits of country member banks in the Reserve system . In addition , country banks have been able to pay off some of their bore owings from the Federal Rci , erve In line with economies effected by industry in general , the farmer has made material cuts zr his living Lusts .
