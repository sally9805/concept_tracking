Brisk was sunspot activity when , in 1908 , Isadore Edelstein first got in bad ( for housebreaking ) in his home State of Kentucky . Since then the ups &; downs of sunspot activity have strangely paralleled the downs &; ups in his life . In sunspotty 1927 he was arrested for safecracking and put away for life in Walla Walla prison as an habitual criminal . In 1934 , when sunspots were infrequent again , Isadore Edelstein won a parole . But two years later , when the sunspots were whirling in baleful profusion , Isadore Edelstein was nabbed for violating his parole , tucked backed in Walla Walla for keeps . <P> Last year and this have been the most spectacular sunspot years since 1870 , but , after one great late-summer burst , their frequency this fall began to dwindle . Fort night ago Isadore Edelstein got a great break . He was paroled again , this time started off for Los Angeles to marry Karen Stone , faithful Texas schoolmarm who had been waiting for him for eleven years . Together they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without sunspots . <P> One night of last week , Isadore Edel stein boarded United Air Lines ' southbound Flight Six at Portland , Ore . Chief pilot was 43-year-old Major Charles Baldwin Stead , with 21 years and 2,000,000 hours of flying behind him . Only other passen gers were a construction executive , a mining engineer , a broker . Fighting a fierce southeast wind , Pilot Stead soon be gan having trouble locating the guiding beam to Sacramento . It was lost in a strange Babel of strong interfering signals from far off-Oakland , Portland , Fresno , Salt Lake City , Reno , everything but the beam that beckoned to nearby Sacramento . <P> What was apparently reshuffling Pilot Stead 's radio cosmos was a phenomenon called the " long skip , " during which radio waves from nearby stations were bouncing beyond him , while others from farther off jumbled strong and clear into his earphones . Cause : a whopper of a sunspot day before the flight . <P> At 4:13 Pilot Stead told Oakland : " Do n't know exactly where I am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5:03 , out over the Pacific , he reported seeing a lighthouse beacon . " Believe you are about eight miles from Point Reyes , " far-off Portland at length told him . Bleak , frowning Point Reyes is 30 miles northwest of the Golden Gate . At 5:22 Stead radioed his last message : " Boys , I have n't got enough gas to make old Crissey Field Oakland . . . . We 'll have to go down in the sea . . . . " <P> Back in the cabin , Stewardess Frona Clay moved everybody up near the pilot 's coop . Pilot Stead brought the ship to a landing so smooth that the group in the cabin took it standing up . Then he herded everyone out the hatch in the top of the cockpit . Thus they all sat , hoping for dawn and rescue , drifting toward the rocks of Point Reyes . <P> Finally the tossing plane began hitting the rocks . One by one the survivors were washed off into the angry water with the shore only 100 yards off . Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great surging wave swept them overboard . They made the beach . <P> Hours later Coast Guardsmen clambered down the 500-foot cliffs of Point Reyes on ropes , ' hoisted the two men safely to the top . Of the others the sea at week 's end had tossed up no trace .
