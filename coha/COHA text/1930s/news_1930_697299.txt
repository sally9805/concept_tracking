Making his report to the commission on the situation in regard to Italy , he read a. note recently communicated to Rome , in which the French Government gave its assurance that during the next six months France will lay down no new ships . The relative naval situation will , therefore , remain as it is until December , by which time the French Foreign Minister hopes conclusions will be reached on the various points under discussion between the two nations and a naval agreement made . Lauds Calm Attitude. / The atmosphere for the resumption of conversations , M. Briand said , had recently improved , and he intended to profit by that .

" In his report to the commission M.

Foreign Minister Briand 's statement that France is postponing her 1930 naval , building program until December in order to clear the way for negotiations with Italy was received in Rome as a gesture of good-will . Some doubt was expressed , however , as to whether France had gone far enough . M. Briand 's announcement to the Foreign Affairs Commission of the French Chamber of Deputies is considered to have smoothed the ground for Italo-French conversations that may ultimately lead to a complete solution of the difficulties between the two countries .
