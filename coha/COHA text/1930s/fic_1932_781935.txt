 | he heard , far away beyond the rampart of trees and the rising bulk of the island , the roar of the wind on the lake and nearer , but not loud , the voices of his men . Meanwhile he stood in silence as palpable as the deep sunshine that lay unruffled all about him . As he walked forward the long grass and flowering autumn weeds brushed against his thighs , almost up to his waist , and he crossed something that must have been a deer run , a narrow line where the grass was bowed . The tranquillity of the place , after his month and a half of stormy travel , touched him as a premonition of good fortune and of charm . Being alone , he ceased to see things as through the eyes of the voyageurs , and a number of pleasant perceptions lifted themselves slowly in his mind , like grass straightening after the passage of steps . Son and grandson and great-grandson of Scotch-Irish merchants , army officers , and semipublic officials , nephew of the Bishop of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rector of Coleraine , also Anglican , with a background of English Latin Schools and Dublin drawing-rooms , he carried an entire continent of culture about with him , separating him definitely , however subtly , from his men , these having all been born here and there , like conies , in the woods they habitually traveled . He was then in his thirtieth year , having privately celebrated his twenty-ninth birthday on the twenty-fifth of August somewhere on the St. Mary 's River , possibly at the foot of Sugar Island . In person he was tall , being just under six feet in height , and well set up . He had a small dark eye , deeply set , but very bright and penetrating ; a forehead high , clear , and sloping , the hair already receding a little at the temples ; a humorous mouth with sensitive , mobile lips and deep corners ; a nose well formed , with the same humorous expression lurking at the nostrils ; the whole face was rather broad , fair , and amiable  --  an open and friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his capot from under a small fur cap was straight and yellow . He wore the soft moccasins common to all those who traveled by canoe , and , instead of the knee breeches and silk stockings to which he had all his life been accustomed , long cloth trousers like those of his men . He had not , however , managed to conform entirely to the wood-runner 's costume ; he wore beneath his capot a coat of light blue with buff facings and brass buttons , and beneath his blue coat a fine white shirt , of which the collar band resolved itself into a stock with ruffled ends . He was John Johnston , the son of William Johnston , retired naval officer and surveyor of Port Rush . His mother was Elizabeth McNeil of Coulreshkan . His last recollection of his father was that of a rider , his clothes heavy with sea water , galloping into the courtyard at dusk on a horse coated with brine . He had been on a visit to a friend on the other side of the River Brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had swum his horse across the river rather than go two miles out of his way to a bridge . He dismounted and called for a boy to take his horse , and went inside in search of a fire and a hot rum toddy . An acquaintance , however , a Doctor Stephenson who had been treating him for dyspepsia , had that day , without explaining it , given him a dose of mercury , the which , combined with the ducking , conspired to give him a fever which carried him off . Young John , then seven years old , was sent off to school in Coleraine , near by , while his father yet lay delirious , and he never saw him again . Next came a long series of recollections more or less monotonous , and somewhat vague also , of the benches of the Latin School where his ingenuity enabled him to learn very little , of the snuff-speckled frock of the Anglican curate who presided over them , and of holidays at his mother 's house near Coleraine . When he  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed in charge of his mother 's financial interests together with those of his Aunt Nancy Johnston , had so mismanaged matters that the business which should have been a source of comparative wealth had become a constant expense , and entailed a system of close economy . This brought young John home from school , when his Aunt Nancy discovered with horror that he could hardly write his name , and that his knowledge of grammar , either English or Latin , was nil . Thereupon this gentlewoman , her modestly powdered curls hidden under a great pleated cap of white holland , her lustrous taffeta skirt beneath a white holland apron , became his tutor in those subjects , and a young man was called in from the village to instruct him in mathematics . At tea time they gathered in the drawing-room  --  his sisters , Eliza and Jane and little Charlotte , and his younger brother William , his mother , freed from her household duties , and his dear Aunt Nancy  --  and when the tray had been set aside and the candles brought in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the works of Dryden or Pope or Shakespeare , while the older girls cut patterns for bobbin lace and Charlotte , gentle creature , sat curled on a tuffet at the side of her brother John . Long , happy evenings ! in winter with the pointed candle flames , in summer with the slow , equable light from the garden and the lawn . The huge illuminated vellum with its blobs of green sealing wax spread over Jane 's knees , and from which she was clipping her pattern , had been presented to his father and to his Uncle Mussinden by the City of Edinburgh . It was unsurpassable for patterns , Jane considered ; she was already at the signatures . When he was fifteen John took to riding , hunting , and coursing greyhounds , spending long hours on the rainy roads and meadows and at the country fairs ; and when he was seventeen he was sent to Belfast to take  | charge of his grandfather 's business , the management of the city 's waterworks . These had been constructed by his grandfather William on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the then Earl not been insane , a purchase of the property might have been effected , but under the circumstances the tutors of the Earl had not the power to grant anything more than a lease ; however , when the works had been built and were in operation the grateful city had given a dinner in honor of the designer , and at that dinner the Earl 's heir , full of good feeling and wine , had publicly pledged himself to grant the lease in perpetuity to William Johnston and his heirs , all present drinking to his resolution and applauding it . At his grandfather 's death the management of the works had gone to his uncle the rector , who , either through dishonesty or through great financial incapacity , had brought the business into such a tangle that it meant nothing but loss to the shareholders . This tangle young Johnston was called upon to straighten out , and he did so well that before long the waterworks were yielding an income and power equaled only by those of the lord of the soil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city of Belfast applied to the Earl ; the Earl , the son of the young heir who had so gallantly promised a grant in perpetuity , felt no responsibility for his ancestor 's fine gesture , and it was agreed that the waterworks , as soon as the latest renewal of the lease should be expired , were to be turned over to the city . In vain did young Johnston wait on the Earl and remind him of his father 's promises . The Earl urbanely felt that the city should control a business so eminently involved in its welfare , and the young man was forced to consider the complete ruin of his fortunes . While there were still some years remaining before the expiration of the lease he sent off his brother William to New York to be indentured to a merchant of  | that city , and he himself set about raising four hundred pounds on the remainder of the lease with which to try his fortune in other parts . He thought first of India , and called upon Lord Macartney with a request for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that nobleman as to the ease with which fortunes might be made in India , he decided to set sail instead for Canada . Lord Macartney , approving of this latter choice , very kindly procured him letters to Lord Dorchester , then Governor General of Canada , and in June , 1790 , he set sail for New York . The years in Belfast had been spent more gayly than wisely , perhaps , but they had at least given him an ease of manner and an insight into the follies of his age not to be obtained in any other way . He had read widely , if not altogether profitably , during those years ; his Aunt Nancy 's schooling yet remained with him . His political faith was simple , being that the first duty of a gentleman was always to the king , and his realization of the state of his country was vague . Had he known more about it , he might have joined the volunteers . However , the habit of his rank , of which he was not a little proud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and 1790 found him in the new continent . Undisturbed by the affairs in France , and yet drawn outward toward the unknown country by something of the same emotion which the next year drew young Chateaubriand to the harbor at Baltimore , he went with a frankly romantic heart , a good head for business , and the most reasonable reason in the world , that of providing the necessities of life for those dependent on him . However romantic or fantastic his actions in the years to come , his life as a whole maintained the standards of the years that bred him ; his personal habits , his manners , his dress , his ultimate individual attitude , remained always those of the eighteenth century gentleman .  | So he arrived in New York , and , having spent some time with his brother William , then an independent merchant because of certain losses and kindnesses of his former master , he traveled by boat and coach to Montreal , and thence to Quebec to present his letters to Lord Dorchester . At Montreal his plans for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his old friend Andrew Tod , the nephew and subsequent heir of the great Isaac Tod , old baron of the Northwest fur wade . Andrew hailed him in a coffee house , his familiar face and snuff-colored coat looming suddenly above a littered table . Andrew was become . a partner of the firm of Tod , Magill and Company . He promptly discouraged his friend in his hopes that Dorchester might be able to do anything for him and advised him , instead of trusting to the great , to enter a real and profitable business , namely , the fur trade , laying before him reports of sales , profits , bargains , opportunities , and adventures , and talking so well that before the evening was over Johnston was quite won to his way of thinking . However , he had the packet of letters to Lord Dorchester , which he felt more or less obliged to deliver ; he was curious about the town of Quebec , and the season was already advanced for setting out for the Indian country . Accordingly he went to Quebec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to Montreal , and , hunting up Andrew , made arrangements to go with him the following spring to Michilimackinac , the entrance to the wilderness . Perhaps it was something more than chance , something social in the man 's temperament , that led him to so many encounters with old friends and acquaintances . From New York to Montreal they did not fail him , and even at Mackinac he discovered in charge of the fort a one-time guest of his mother 's house . This was lieutenant Edward Charleton , in command of the Fifth Infantry . Although the accident was pleasant , it saddened  | the Irishman momentarily , bringing so freshly to mind the days of his own better fortunes . They had come overland from Montreal , taking the Ottawa River route , avoiding the longer journey and the great falls at Niagara , but making many more portages and being almost constantly in the mosquitoinfested woods . The men who carried the packs on these portages , their hands being occupied , had no way of protecting themselves from the pest , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , green boughs rebounding from the shoulders of the man before striking their cheeks and foreheads , nevertheless laughing at their own sanguinary countenances and making sport of the younger voyageurs who were making their first trip . Johnston and Tod suffered extremely , their faces being so badly swollen as to be almost deformed , and it was in this condition , with misshapen features and travel-stained garments , that they reached Mackinac . Charleton received them at the fort in a cool , orderly room in a house of whitewashed stone . About them the parade grounds were grassy and almost as velvety as an English lawn ; the cedars , masses of horizontally shattered emerald ; daisies on the steep hillside . From the ramparts they looked down upon the crescent of the bay , the Indian wigwams , the few scattered houses  --  whitewashed logs and picket stockades  --  of the permanent Canadian village . Beyond , the water of the Straits , blue in the sunshine , ruffling and sparkling under a strong wind , and on cloudy days running into green , indigo , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of good liquor , roast game , and even a few fresh vegetables from the garden of the fort , and they stayed there from the date of their arrival , May 16 , until Johnston 's departure in August , when Andrew outfitted him with all things proper for a wintering , and he started forth , for the first time since his corning  | to America , entirely among strangers . September brought him to Ile St. Michel . He went on through the glade and , reconnoitering farther up the western shore , pitched upon a place nearer the growth of old timber which seemed to be good for a permanent camp . When he returned he found the men throwing up a rude shelter of boughs , the canoe unpacked , and a fire going . Florentin had been busy with the nets and had taken four large whitefish , which were now in a kettle swung high above the fire , cooking slowly . Johnston undid the pack of tobacco and gave rack man the usual portion for a regale , together with a ration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their meal was eaten before sundown , and when it was over the men took off their wet moccasins And hung them near the fire , filled their pipes , and settled themselves to rest . That night a stranger presented himself at their fire , a man dressed in the moccasins and capot of a voyageur , but having a distinguished bearing , more nervous , more withdrawn than the easy grace of the canoe men . They had not supposed there was another white man on the island . He advanced from the shadow of the trees into their firelight and announced himself as the Count Andriani , adding , after a brief pause , with a slight humorous twist of the lips , of Milan . Johnston rose and introduced himself , John Johnston , of Craige , County Antrim , Ireland . They made a place for the stranger in the shelter of the canoe , and sitting there , cross-legged , leaning slightly forward toward the fire , he explained slowly in French his business in the country . He had come with the permission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of the shape of the earth , which he had every reason to believe , he said , was flattened at the poles . He had been at La Pointe two weeks , taking measurements  | and making astronomical observations . They were , he informed them , six hundred and ninety feet above sea level , and nearly two thousand miles from the sea . He said that he hoped to settle , upon his return to the continent , this violently debated question once and for all . It was his firm belief that the earth at both the poles was covered by the ocean , nay , by a waste of frozen ocean so desolate that it would never be explored . But mathematics o'erleaped the poles , he said , and made him as certain of his facts as if he had gone over the whole territory a step at a time . He spoke slowly and carefully , with almost no trace of an accent save his meticulous care of the language . The Canadians listened respectfully , Johnston with enthusiasm . The white wilderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter , and they were easily convinced of the power of mathematics . When he had finished they talked of the fur trade , of the treachery of Indians and the increasing scarcity of beaver . Andriani had a theory that the Northwest Company kept all its voyageurs in debt to itself , a means of assuring a sort of slavery . He even went so far as to say that most of the men were in debt to the extent of ten years ' salary . The company did this in part by the ingenious device of shifting the standard of currency at the border of the Indian territory , a livre becoming in value double a Montreal livre . Since the men purchased in the territory and were paid at Montreal , or according to Montreal standards , they were easily confused ; what seemed cheap in the territory was dear at Montreal , a year later , and they ran easily into debt . He said also that the village at La Pointe was one of the most profitable stations in the Northwest , giving yearly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberte , warmed by the rum and the unexpected conversation , began to tell stories of La Pointe , of the ground under the scrub oaks full of the bones of  | slaughtered Iroquois , of the old Ojibway warrior swimfiling the channel from St. Michel to La Pointe with his weapons in his teeth in order to strike one blow before all the Iroquois should have fled or been killed , of the Indian jugglers who could roll naked on live coals , who could escape from the most cleverly tied ropes , who could make a distant empty lodge tremble as with the ague , and lastly , lowering his voice and twisting in his fingers the braided morsel of tobacco , he began to tell stories of cannibalism on Ile St. Michel . It went on and went on , " he said . " The people were frightened but the jugglers would n't let them go away . They would n't let them stop , non plus . When they put a spell on a person he died , or he was killed , and after he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of him , and part he made to eat the wife or brother or relative of him who was killed , until many people in the village were cannibal . So then , one night a wife whose husband had been enchanted and killed watched at the grave and fought with the juggler when he came to dig . Then , soon after , there were ghosts . There were everywhere ghosts , and suddenly the people ran away . They went over to the mainland and they never came back for many years . They do not like to come now . They will come , yes , in the daytime , but they do not like to stay . That is why there are no wigwams on St. Michel . " He paused , staring at the fire , bewitched by his own tale . Then : " In the old days all the wigwams were on St. Michel . It was very safe from the Iroquois . But now , nobody . It only lasted a little while , part of one generation , that was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And now , personne . " It was late . Florentin rose to lay another stick on the fire . He stood a moment , scraping the coals together , and then went back to his place . The voice of La Liberte , although silent , repeated slowly , " And now , personne . " Andriani left them . His encampment lay a little to the  | north along the west shore . He had with him half a dozen men . He would see them in the morning . La Liberte wrapped himself in his blanket , drawing his capot over his head and shoulders . Florentin laid one more log on the fire and , lying down on the ground upon his blanket , rolled over three times and lay still , a mummy . Johnston , a little apart from the men , folded his cap under his head for a pillow and went to sleep . The moon came up behind the trees , laying a color of ashes across the glow of the coals . The Irishman slept without dreaming , drugged with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard through his sleep a light hoof stamp imperatively on the ground near his head . He woke and lay still . The stamp was repeated , followed by a low , full whistle . Then the deer swung about and bounded into the brush , followed by another more distant . III IN the morning they began to construct two cabins , one for the men and one for the bourgeois . Florentin was to bunk in the kitchen of Johnston 's two-room house ; the men 's cabin had only one room . The site which Johnston had selected was level and they had to carry the felled trees only a short distance . The cabins were built of round logs , unpeeled , the ends hewed flat on two sides , leaving the core of the wood unexposed , and fitted together . The interstices were chinked with moss and mud , and a fireplace and chimney were constructed for each , of small logs and sticks thickly plastered with mud . The floors were the trodden earth . They hung a blanket over the door of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hinges for Johnston 's . For fastening , this door had a strong bar fitted to sockets on the inside . After the walls were fairly well up Florentin was detailed to the nets , and they began to lay in a plentiful  | supply of whitefish and sturgeon . A fire , with a smoking-rack above it of green saplings , was kindled near the beach , and at evening Florentin superintended the process of curing the fresh meat . Andriani 's men offered to help with the building , and the Count himself came every evening to sit beside the fire and exchange opinions with the Irishman . They talked of the meaning of the aurora borealis , then wavering in brilliance overhead , of the cause of shooting stars , of whether the Irish had the right to rebel against an English monarch , of the reason for the seven-year tides observed , or supposed to have been observed , in Lakes Michigan and Huron , of the vogue for beaver hats in England , of the horse races in Belfast , of Johnston 's uncle , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's woodpile became the next pressing need ; and the fishing went forward steadily . The Indians had learned of the coming of the new trader . On the third day after his arrival three canoes beached themselves softly , and the entire family of Le Ciel Vert came hesitatingly and shyly to the spot where Johnston sat on a newly felled log , writing in his journal . The place was fragrant with scattered chips and crushed herbs . Le Ciel Vert seated himself , his Launches on his heels , and taking a little tobacco and a little kinnikinnik from the pouch at his belt , began to crush and mingle them in the palm of his hand . His people gathered around him . He tamped the powdered leaves into the bowl of a long-stemmed pipe , struck a spark from his flint , and proceeded to surround himself with smoke like the haze of an autumn hillside . Johnston , who had greeted him , brought out a few of his wares , and the wife of Le Ciel Vert , at his order , unrolled a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspected the skins , laid out a fathom of strouds , that inexpensive but durable and almost waterproof woolen , two pounds of powder , one pound of bullets ,  | and a foot of braided tobacco . The trading proceeded by signs , Florentin being away on the water . Le Ciel Vert accepted this value for his furs and asked for a credit . He wanted two large traps , two little ones , a piece of red cloth and a keg of rum . Johnston refused him the keg , but gave him a drink because he was his first customer . The Indian promised to return the next spring with furs to the full value of his credit . He rose and shook hands solemnly with the new trader , and departed , his people casting lingering glances over their shoulders at the strange proceedings of the Saugaunosh . La Liberte , who during this interview had been shaping and setting in place a pine log , now paused , ax in hand , and said to Johnston , " If you do not give them rum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What traders ? " asked Johnston , somewhat surprised . " The others at La Pointe , " answered the Frenchman . " Florentin saw them . They are Canadians who speak the Indian language very well . They are independents , like yourself ; they belong to no company . They do what they like , and they give plenty of rum . " Johnston said nothing to this ; La Liberte shrugged his shoulders and went back to his work . It was the usual plan for a trader to distribute as many of his goods before snowfall as he could . It saved him the responsibility of carrying them through the winter , and bound the Indians to bring him their furs in the spring . If he waited to trade with them until they had the furs actually in hand , they were just as likely not to come at all . They might travel off to Mackinac or to the Grand Portage in hopes of much liquor and a good time , or they might trade them to the men sent out to the very trapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called . All through the month of October and well into November Indians were coming , bargaining , smoking , asking for rum , and investigating  | with childlike thoroughness and frankness the affairs , habits , and clothing of the new bourgeois . After many conversations , many amicable disputes , Andriani loaded his canoe and departed , having embraced his heaven-sent friend upon both cheeks . Johnston detailed Tremblay and Paul Joseph with a small equipment to the Riviere Mauvaise . They were to winter there , and return in the spring with such furs as they might harvest . La Liberte and the other man , Leon , took them down and returned with the canoe . They said that an Indian had given them temporary shelter and that they should have a very good season . In the intervals of trading and fishing the woodcutting went on . The leaves had now all fallen from the trees , leaving only the evergreens crisp and definite in shape . Beneath the haze of impoverished boughs the earth lay rustling with ashes of roses , primrose , champagne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit . The sunsets , beginning early and going forward slowly until late evening , were a cold orange fading into a colder yellow , tinged with green . The color lay low in the sky , as if it were a heavier liquid in another liquid , showing just above the black serrated silhouette of the woods . A chillness breathed upwards from the earth in which the withered asters , the small twiggy bushes , seemed to bristle like fur in the cold . " A spirit passed before my face and the hair of my flesh stood up , " said Johnston to himself . The ice in the bay now began to freeze definitely . A canoe could progress only slowly , breaking the film of glass with each stroke of the paddle and with danger , for the ice tore and cut the birchbark . Then an unexpected thaw loosened it for three days . On the evening of the sixteenth of November La Liberte begged the privilege of smoking a pipe at the fire of his bourgeois . Johnston , who missed the talkative Count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a childhood among  | the Ottawa wigwams on Lake Huron , below Manitouline , but could speak very little of the language . " My father took me away when I was very little to bring me up French . I am French now , pas sauvage . Yes , I am raised French . " He said : " It is true that the Indians still will eat a little of the flesh of a brave man , but it is his braveness they eat , it is not as in the old days . For myself , " he said , " I would rather be a mangeur de lard . " He laughed . A soup of maize and deer meat , boiling for tomorrow 's victuals in a pot set on a tripod of three rocks , rose slowly in a yellowish foam , and Florentin , leaning forward , dropped gently across the surface of it a small branch of balsam . The bubbling subsided slowly and continued at a safe distance below the rim of the vessel . La Liberte said : " Before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last year I saw him . He is a very great warrior and a good trapper . I will be telling my children some day that I saw Le Pecan Blanc . " Again he laughed . " I , who am not sauvage , to brag at having seen a sauvage ! " " What is it , " said Johnston , " a pecan ? " " A fisher . Like an otter , but smaller and more fierce . A White Fisher . " Upon leaving he saluted Johnston with a lift of the hand . The white teeth of his smile , the little black mustache , the ruddy cheeks and heavy shoulders , disappeared into the night , and Johnston told the boy to bank the fire and go to bed . Morning of the seventeenth dawned upon a world of frost and mist . A pool of water near the door was frozen , and splintered underfoot , leaving an empty space between the ice and earth . The leaves were hoary , and through the mist the colors of all other things showed whitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hole in the skim ice for water with which to bathe his face . He noticed then that the ice had already  | been broken . He returned toward the cabin and saw that the canoe was gone from its place . He went back again to the shore , and cupping his hands about his mouth shouted into the mist , " Leon ! Leon ! La Liberte ! " The shore of La Pointe responded vaguely through the mist , " Li-ber-te ! " Somewhat alarmed , he ran back to the cabin where Florentin was getting breakfast . " Why did the men go out so early ? " he asked . The boy looked up at him a moment and mutely shook his head . The men 's cabin , when he came to search it , showed plainly enough the loss . The nets were gone , the axes were gone , most of the supply of smoked fish was gone , and the men 's private duffle , together with a good share of the pork and corn . He ran wildly back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've left us ! " " Yes , " said Florentin , bending above the bowl of maize and venison . Johnston returned to the shore , where he sat down on a rock , and having stared desolately into the mist , sank his head in his hands and gave way to despair . No canoe , no nets , no axes , hardly enough supplies for the winter , no help and no neighbors . Unless the Canadians ? As this thought came into his head , Florentin called from the door , " The men at La Pointe they tell them they better go . They don ' like to make so much enemies , and they go . Me , I don ' mind . You better come eat . " Having thus bestowed his best consolation , the boy returned to his meal , and waited for the return of his bourgeois . When after half an hour the latter , with utterly dejected countenance , reentered the cabin , he found Florentin whittling an ax helve . He then remembered that he had ax heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progressed far enough . He took the ax , when the boy had finished and wedged it , and went off into the woods feeling like Robinson  | Crusoe , and , having invoked this hero of his childhood , spat on his hands and fell to . The hands blistered shortly , and after that the blisters broke and the new ax handle was stained with blood . Florentin , who had been carrying wood , now chopped , and Johnston carried , and turn and turn about they added to the woodpile and staved off despair . The week after , the bay froze finally and the snow in a few days merged the outlines of land and water . Ile St. Michel became one with La Pointe and the mainland . The visits of the Indians ceased for a time . As long as the depth of snow permitted , Johnston and his man chopped and carried home firewood , rolling the logs that were too large to carry , and constructing a massive barricade between their doorway and the bitter weather , but soon a blizzard put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cabin , but by the light of the fire Johnston got out his books and went carefully over his accounts , trying to calculate his profits for the spring . Every man employed by the Northwest Company was obliged to keep a journal which was to be presented at the winter 's end to the partners at Grand Portage . Johnston also kept a journal , but it was for no one 's pleasure save his own , and he filled it with reveries , moral observations , and verses of his own composition . He had ample leisure now to remember Ireland , and between the entries in his account book and the neat pages of his journal he envisioned the parlor at Craige , his sisters cutting patterns for bobbin lace , his mother reading aloud from Dryden or Shakespeare , or himself , had he been there , riding to the county fair through the mild drizzle of an Irish winter . The happiest sight of all , to his mind , was the post rumbling into Coleraine at the hour when the windows were lighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a sack of letters .  | To Le Tems Couvert credit for sixteen plus To Le Genou credit for four plus To Le Gros Pied credit for six plus Note , Le Gros Pied is the father of the chief . A blob of snow fell from the chimney and hissed in the fire . The plus was the value of one good beaver skin , the monetary unit of the Northwest Fur Company . All other values were reckoned from it , thus : a good bearskin was worth two plus , a deerskin one-half plus , ten muskrats were worth one plus , a carrot of tobacco ( two or three pounds ) was worth two plus , a brasse ( fathom ) of cloth , two plus , a pair of scarlet leggins , two plus , a keg of unwatered rum , forty plus . Malhiot twelve years later at this same station gave an Indian for the meat of a bear credit for four plus . Before they parted at Mackinac , Andrew Tod had instructed Johnston in the values of the trade , giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unsteady firelight . His mind deserted Coleraine for the winter before at Montreal . Montreal was O'Sullivan 's Coffee House ; was the Beaver Club , the social organization of the Northwest Company at which he had occasionally been a guest , not being then eligible as a member , since he had not yet spent a winter in the Indian country ; was the house of Sir John and Lady Johnson , where he had known such lavish and repeated hospitality . A gentleman with a long Scotch countenance and a shrewd bright eye appeared sometimes at the coffee house , was to be passed on the street or met with at the door of the Assembly , a gentleman whose upper lip was long and clean-shaven , whose hair was clipped close to his long narrow head , whose broadcloth , whose linen , were faultless , whose whole bearing bespoke a canny elegance imposed upon a certain hardiness of flesh and spirit  | Simon McTavish of the Northwest Company . And there was also Alexander Henry , with his long nose and high forehead , the hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arrogant carriage of the head and the mettlesome profile , to be found most often at the carousals of the Beaver Club , and already grown a little heavy and reminiscent . This was the man who lay hidden under the pile of bark sugar buckets in the attic of M. Langlade at Old Mackinac while the bloodiest of massacres went on below , lay in hiding because he had waited in vain to hear the trumpet blow to a rally . This same man with the Scotch accent still thick about his tongue had also been adopted blood brother by an Ojibway chief . And there was also the sleek and easy countenance  --  easy when not stubborn  --  of the son of Sir William Johnson , Sir John Johnson , well liked in Canada and cordially hated in the valley of his birth , the Mohawk ; and the vivacious features of his wife , the charming New York woman . He remembered the balls given for Lady Johnson and her daughter . He remembered the evenings at Varennes , across the river from Montreal , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amiable M. Vienne , his landlord , who had so patiently instructed him in French . Then he would sigh , and turn to Florentin with any question that offered , just for the sake of hearing him speak , and Florentin , sometimes puzzled at the interruption , would life his straight thick eyebrows a little and answer slowly . The cold deepened . The continual inexorable approach of it , in its silence , its weightlessness and invisibility , were strangely ominous to one unused to it . It increased after it seemed to have reached its maximum , and then again it increased . And the snow fell dry and powdery . When Johnston opened the cabin door at night to fetch in another log , the glow from the house penetrated the darkness a little way and showed it full of whirling whiteness ; these flakes defined the space in which they  | moved so that the house was not surrounded by a flat curtain of darkness but by a hollowed and receding gulf of black , filled with a restless white air , and breathing cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living presence and steadied the new log across the embers of the old , bracing it with the forelog until the flames curled in a broad fluid sheet across the shaggy surface . Florentin was making a net , the only indication in the world , it seemed , that there would ever be a spring . He held a small tapering stick in his hands , the mesh marker , and tied his loops around it one after the other as patiently as a woman knitting . His hands were brown , and clever in spite of their great size . The ball of net twine on the floor beside him twitched now and again , and rolled over a little , twitched and lay still , as if an invisible kitten were playing with it . On the black throat of the chimney little clusters of sparks appeared , burning sharply for a moment , then disappearing , golden constellations . When they appeared so in autumn it meant that the wild geese were flying overhead , but tonight there were no geese . The woods had seemed deserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his net , Johnston with his recollections of the vice-regal ball and the governor 's lady , when the door opened slowly , although no one had knocked , and an Indian entered the room . The storm flew in after him . He shut the door , and lifting his blanket from his head and shoulders , shook the dry snow upon the ground . His hair was white , his face wrinkled , and the upper part of his body , which was bare , was wrinkled at the armpits and across the abdomen . He stooped a little . He wore moccasins and leggins of dark blue cloth , and at his belt he carried his knife , his hatchet , and two small bags . He seemed very tired . He smiled a little at the two men , lifting his hand in sign of greeting . Johnston  | recognized him as an Indian to whom he had given a small credit earlier in the fall . The Indian said , " My father , pity me . I am very hungry and I ask you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on : " In the early fall I went up the Mauvaise with my family and gathered plenty of wild rice . We came back to Chegoimegon Bay and I put my rice in a cache . Then I left my family and went with my traps to the beaver grounds above the Mauvaise . I took seven good beavers and some muskrats . I am an old man . I can not hunt now as I used to . When the cold weather came I re-. turned to Chegoimegon . I said , I will take these beavers to the Yellow Haired to pay for the credit which he gave me , and he will give me pork and blankets for the winter . I shall have the wild rice , also . My family is small and we shall not need so much to eat . ' The water was freezing . I came with my family along the shore by La Pointe and as I passed the house of the Canadians they called to me . My father , I remembered that you gave me a credit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water and seized the prow of my canoe . I am an old man , I could not fight with them . They took from thy canoe my beavers and my pack of small skins , and they made me come ashore with them . They took me to their house and gave me whiskey to drink . I do not know what happened . They gave me more whiskey . By and by I looked at the water and I saw that the ice was thick and that I could not go away in my canoe . I said to them , Give me my furs and I will go on foot and pay my credit to the Yellow Haired . ' They said , Fool , you have traded all your furs . ' Then I said , Give me the goods for which I traded them . ' They said , You drank the goods . ' Then they put me out of doors , with my women . It was very cold . My wife made a wigwam for us , and she had hidden a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so for two , three weeks . Now for five days we have eaten nothing . The snow is  | very deep . We set snares for rabbits but they are all hidden , they will not come to the snares . If I had snowshoes I would go to my cache of wild rice , but I am old , I can not walk in the deep snow without snowshoes . My father , give us something to eat . " He knelt then , and unfastening from his belt one of the small pouches , drew from it a bundle wrapped in printed calico . The pouch seemed to be made of a dark , strong fiber , closely woven . It was pliable , yet stiff . From the bundle the dark trembling fingers drew a roll of blue and white beads , which , unrolled , became a wampum belt of blue with figures in white . Beside it he laid a silver gorget . Blue sky , white clouds . He said : " These were given to me , to Ma-mongazid , twentyseven years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mohawks , gave them to me . I have kept them without stain twenty-seven years . When I die , my son , Waub-ojeeg , will keep them without stain . There will never be any stain on them . I will pay you back the credit . If I die , my son will pay it back . My father , we are starving . Give us food . " Johnston was strongly moved by this appeal , but he had been told many tales of begging Indians . He preached a little homily about paying one 's debts and keeping away from strong drink . He reminded himself somewhat of his uncle the Bishop , talking to an Irish cottager . The image disturbed him , and he hastened to add that the friend of Sir William Johnson was his honored guest . Florentin brought food and a bearskin rug for the old man . Before the fire Ma-mongazid recovered a little of the manner of his youth , and Johnston sorted out a bundle of provisions for him . " Look , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too have very little food for the winter , but while I have food , you shall share it . " He told the story of the desertion of his men . The Indian did not seem surprised . He listened gravely , nodding  | now and then . Johnston brought tobacco , and they smoked to the new friendship . He also offered a drink of rum , but the Indian motioned it away . Florentin , meanwhile , was full of good ideas . He suggested that Ma-mongazid ask his women to prepare a deerskin for a window , and that Ma-mongazid himself make two pairs of snowshoes . The following day Ma-mongazid brought his two wives and his daughter-in-law to the cabin and work on the snowshoes was begun while the women selected a deerskin for the window . The snow had ceased to fall , and the air , filled with sunshine , was pure and rare . Johnston , stepping out of doors , experienced once more the joy of living . Ma-mongazid , following him , insisted on smearing his cheeks below the eyes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the snow blindness from you . " He went with Johnston into the woods and showed him how to set a rabbit snare . The snowshoe frames were of ash wood , steamed and bent into the shape of two half moons placed together . The tips curved up a little . The wife of Ma-mongazid laced them with narrow strips of deerskin and wove a socket for the toe of each foot . The heel was not fastened down , but lifted with each step , the tail of the shoe dragging on the snow . Three pairs were made , one each for Johnston and Florentin , and one for Ma-mongazid in part payment for his labor . He received also a deerskin and a sack of corn . A window , two feet long and one foot high , was cut in the cabin wall near the door , and the deerskin stretched across it . The wife of Ma-mongazid had taken the pelt , stiff , hairy , unclean with withered flesh , and brought it back supple , smooth , translucent , and almost as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rectangle of mellow light by which it was possible to work even when the fire was low . For this Johnston gave the woman a brasse , that is to say , a fathom , of blue strouds , of which she made a shirt for her husband .  | The weather for some time continued clear and bright and the dryness of the air was deceiving . One morning while he was chopping wood Johnston was astonished to see the steel ax head break in two and fall from the helve ; and the struck wood rang musically , as if it had been metal . Ma-mongazid came to tell them that he was going to La Riviere Mauvaise with his family . He shook hands with the bourgeois and his man , and told them that in case they were in want , to let him know . Johnston did not even smile at this offer , with such dignity and simplicity was it made . IV WAUB-OJEEG and his people had ascended the Wisakoda and , leaving it , had moved from lake to small lake through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the White Fisher to make the circuit of his hunting grounds and return to the great lake by way of the Montreal River . In December they were encamped on the shore of a small lake high in the Kaug Mountains , a lake blue and changeable in summer , but now white and distinguishable only as a long glade between the crowded evergreens . Here a visitor came to them in the person of an Ojibway hunter seeking justice . He , Little Thunder , had found the traps of Cloud Approaching set within his own trapping territory . Being very angry at this intrusion , he had taken from the traps six muskrats and a beaver and left a bark message to the intruder to remove his traps and be gone . Cloud Approaching not only had not gone , he had come to the shelter of Little Thunder and reproached him with the theft of one beaver and six muskrats . Therefore Little Thunder had broken camp and come to his chief for advice . He laid this story before Waub-ojeeg with many justifications for his actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacked Cloud Approaching . Cloud Approaching was a relative of his wife 's mother . He did not wish to murder his wife 's mother 's relative , and moreover Waub-ojeeg had forbidden his people to fight over traps . He drew a map on the ground , indicating the disputed territory . Wayishkee , seated near him , corroborated his statements . Wayishkee knew the territory of Cloud Approaching , and said that he was truly the transgressor . This dispensing of justice was as much a part of Waub-ojeeg 's duty as leading his people to war , for he was both war and civil chief , an instance rare in Ojibway history . He deliberated the case with a pipeful of tobacco , and finally told Little Thunder that he had best return the pelts . The meat , which he had partly consumed , he might keep . He asked him to return the pelts because Cloud Approaching was a relative and it was not wise to quarrel within one 's own family . Moreover the traps and the labor were Cloud Approaching 's , and Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give a message to Little Thunder to present to Cloud Approaching , warning him to stay in his own territory , and he would send one small mokkuk of sugar to the wife of Little Thunder as a gift from Waub-ojeeg . He , their chief , would make this small present to the family of Little Thunder to compensate him for the wrong done him by Cloud Approaching , and to keep peace in his tribe . They smoked another pipe on the decision , and Wayishkee made ready the message for Cloud Approaching , which consisted principally of a piece of birchbark incised with the figure of a fisher touched with white  --  but not on the mouth , which would have signified starvation  --  surrounded by figures which declared the totem of the fisher , the deer , and the names and totems of the quarrelers arranged in such a way as to make plain the White Fisher 's intention toward the other two . The plaintiff was satisfied with this justice , the more so since in winter  | sugar was scarce in his wigwam . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish and had smoked a great quantity of sturgeon and whitefish . He had not left until late in October , and before his departure a new trader had arrived at Ile St. Michel . The trader had yellow hair , like corn tassels , he said , and laughed easily . He had taken a great many things on credit from the trader and promised him all his pack ; therefore he felt it important to take as many beavers as he could that winter . Truly , the trader had let him have a very large credit . Waub-ojeeg replied that before his departure there had been two traders at La Pointe , and that they were more than enough . He preferred to have his traders remain at the Sault or at Mackinac , but what could you do ? The Northwest now sent traders to the very trapping ground to take the furs before they had been scraped or dried . The winter went on . Waub-ojeeg had taken enough furs for three packs . He talked a little of stopping , and returning to Chegoimegon before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He coughed a great deal , and said that he was burning up , but in the early morning he woke his wife and asked her to bring him more covers . She laid a bearskin over him , but he still complained of being cold . Toward noon the next day he began to burn again . She was frightened and sent Wayishkee for a Jossakeed . The Woman of the Glade made a mixture of parched corn and maple sugar and put it in a bag for her brother , together with a small package of neebish , black tea . She brought out his snowshoes , and gave him four extra pairs of moccasins , and he started at once , traveling down the unbroken white surface of the lake , lost to sight finally behind a projecting point of evergreens . Waub-ojeeg was restless . He felt better now , and talked of going to his traps . He called for his moccasins and mittens and snowshoes , and when his daughter had brought them , was tired  | again , and laid them beside him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After the dishes had been cleared away , and while his wife was putting the little children to bed , wrapping them in furs and blankets in the far end of the lodge , and drawing a fold of blanket over each little face , he called to Ozhah-guscoday-wayquay to bring him his drum , and began to sing the lament of the Battle of the St. Croix . He sang the first words of it to the slow beating of the drum , and then , laying down his stick , said , " It is here that it hurts me . " He put his hand on his breast , above the old scar . He said , " It is a Sioux devil , after all these years . It hurts very much . " Then he picked up the stick with its head of deerskin padding and went on with the song . It seemed to tire him to sing , and his wife begged him to stop . He shook his head and went on , and soon he was weeping . The tears ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand on his breast , and said , " It is here that it hurts . It hurts in my heart and in my breast . " When he had finished the lament , he sang his war song , and then a song for a dance , and then , laying aside the drum , he began to tell again the story of the Battle of the St. Croix . The girl had heard it many times before , but never before had her father wept as he told it . He tired himself , but he would not stop . Again the warriors gathered at Chegoimegon , three hundred Ojibways in full regalia of paint and feathers . The novices , who had never been to battle before , were painted black upon their breasts and faces . They left Chegoimegon in small canoes , easy to carry and easy to turn quickly , and ascended the Mauvaise . It was summer . They made the portages with great caution , going so quietly and slowly that it was seven days before they reached the St. Croix portage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bowls , seven nights of sleeping with their faces turned toward the country to which they wished to return when the battle was over . They  | encamped at last on the upper end of the portage , only to discover to their great surprise a large war party of Sioux and Foxes encamped on the lower end . The two war parties discovered each other almost simultaneously . The novices leapt into the water and began to wash the black from their faces . Waub-ojeeg extended his arms and made his exhortation to his warriors . The air was full of war cries . In the Sioux camp , within plain view of the Ojibways , similar preparations were going forward . Then the battle began . The Sioux , full of vainglory and seeing themselves twice the number of their enemies , divided in two , one half to fight , the other half to sit on the rocks above the portage and cheer . The battle ground was a " mere neck of rugged rock , " from which there was but one way of escape , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of escape was occupied by the Ojibways . The fight went forward with fury . When the first contingent of Sioux had been defeated , the second , unfatigued , swept down upon the tired Ojibways , and would have annihilated them had not a party of sixty men from a northern village arrived at the critical instant . These sixty had received the wampum of Waub-ojeeg and had started for Chegoimegon , arriving there too late to join the main body , and had come on by themselves . To the confused Sioux and Foxes the air was suddenly full of multiplied Ojibways , fresh as the morning and merciless as winter . Many of them fled , leaping into the rapids , and many of them were drowned . When the last living Sioux had disappeared , Waub-ojeeg turned to count his losses . His brother was dead . He himself was wounded in three places , on the breast , on the left shoulder , and on the thigh , and all around him lay his friends , wounded or dead . He finished his story . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in twenty years to the rice lakes of the St. Croix . He drew his blanket over his head and wept as his people had never seen him weep .  | His wife brought him furs and laid them beside him , covered the fire with ashes , and motioned to the others to go to sleep . The Woman of the Glade drew her blanket over her head , and saw in the darkness the rapid waters of the St. Croix running bloody between the jagged rocks . Wayishkee returned on the evening of the second day with a Jossakeed who was also a Mide of the third degree , and a small lodge for the sick man was speedily constructed at a little distance from the others . They swept away the snow , covered the earth with balsam boughs , and the boughs with skins . They brought the sick man and laid him on the floor . His wife and Ozhahguscoday-wayquay were there because he had asked for them , and Wayishkee in order to assist the Jossakeed . The Jossakeed beat his drum and threw tobacco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sick man with a narrow tube in his fingers , the leg bone of a heron , hollow and polished . He pressed one end of this upon the old bullet wound and , leaning forward , sucked vigorously . After a while he rose , and spitting into his hand a small shell , said , " It was the Sioux manido . Here it is . I have sucked it forth . " He then showed it to every one and dropped it into the fire . Then he covered his patient and gave instructions for his care . Wayishkee took the Jossakeed to the lodge and entertained him , and the Woman of the Glade brought her father a bowl of soup . He smiled at her . He said that he felt better but very tired . For nearly two weeks he remained in the small lodge , sleeping a great part of the time , and being fed soup and boiled rice , and finally , on a day when the sun was shining and the air mild , he came from the lodge into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , very strong . He did not wish to continue his trapping and hunting , and soon after this illness they broke camp and returned , all of them , to La Pointe , coming down the long portage of the Montreal with  | their possessions on dog trains or in bundles carried on their shoulders with the tumpline about the forehead . They had taken furs enough for that season , and at La Pointe Wayishkee would be able to spear fish . V WITH Johnston , on Ile St. Michel , the visits of Indians had become few and far between . Occasionally they brought him fish , and more rarely were willing to trade him the flesh of a bear or a moose . In January his supply of goods was much depleted and he had accumulated peltries to the amount of eight packs . He counted on the credits given in the autumn to bring the final total up to seventeen packs , and matters on that score looked well enough , but the food situation began to be serious . He had depended upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceased altogether and he found that he had on hand only very short rations of corn and no pork whatever . He knew that there were a few families at the Red Cliff Point as well as at the village on the Mauvaise , and remembering that Tremblay and Leon might still be at the Mauvaise , possibly with the two other deserters , he decided not to venture in that direction , but sent off Florentin the last week in February to the Red Cliff village , with instructions to bring back whatever he could find to eat . He waited for the boy ten days . At that time there were in his larder corn enough for three days , tea enough for three months , and plenty of rum , but one can not sustain health on a diet of tea and rum . Accordingly , on the morning of the eleventh day he built a smudge fire in the fireplace to give the house a look of habitation , barricaded the door , and set off on snowshoes for the mainland . Although he had never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction in which it lay and that  | the distance from his cabin should not exceed fifteen miles . He set out cheerfully , expecting to be at the village before noon . Once out of the lee of the island , he felt the cold more sharply , and an intermittent wind which lifted the dry snow in whirlwinds confused him as to his direction . He made as straightly as he could for the wooded shore , but was long in reaching it , and knew that his uncertain course had more than doubled the distance . In the shelter of the trees he went forward more steadily , and at noon , being still far from any habitation , made camp and ate a little dry corn . He tried to make a fire , but the wind carried the spark away from his flint . After a half hour 's rest he got up and went on . His fatigue was great , and he began to experience a profound personal humility in the face of the snow and wind and the silences which followed the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depths of the forest a muffled sharp report , resembling a pistol shot , which he knew to be a tree cracking in the intense cold . There were no human noises . In the morning his feet had stung painfully . Now they no longer pained him , and once he seemed to wake from a sleep to find himself still traveling between the monotonous dark woods and the more monotonous lake . Late in the afternoon he saw , a short distance ahead of him and about a half a mile out on the ice , something that might have been a log or the prostrate body of a man with a very large pack on his shoulders . It was lost to view and reappeared as the dunelike drifts of snow shifted their attitudes with his approach , but at last he made it out to be a man lying flat on the ice , his head and shoulders hidden under one of those small lodges of cedar boughs which the Indians , when they were spearing fish , erected to darken the water as a man hoods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaft of a fishing spear rose through the opening designed for the purpose , and abruptly fell . He gave a halloo , and at once pitched forward into  | the snow . He felt , rather than heard , the fisherman approach ; he knew , as drowsiness overcame him , that he was being lifted to some one 's shoulders , and believed that his rescuer was young and an Indian . After a time he was slid to his feet , and a word was said to him in Ojibway which seemed to mean " Enter . " He opened his eyes and saw a long wigwam of birchbark , silvery gray in the purity of the snow . The boy who had brought him there was holding aside a tawny deerskin which hung at the entrance . Beyond this curtain he saw an interior which trembled slightly in a ruddy glow . Some one from within said " Bindigay , Bindigay . " The young Indian pushed him gently forward and he entered the lodge of Waub-ojeeg . The warmth of the place made Johnston a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry and the pressure of hands on his shoulders ; he looked up from the bench where they had seated him and saw floating before him the delighted face of the old Mamongazid . He dropped his eyes to the bent head and busy hands of Wayishkee , who was rubbing his feet with snow , and beyond Wayishkee he saw the curious , wondering face of a very young girl . Gradually the lodge steadied itself , the face of the girl disappeared , his feet began to come to life again , and another figure joined the figure of Ma-mongazid in front of him , that of a man perhaps forty-four years old , tall , astonishingly tall , slender , erect , and well made . The upper part of his body was bare save for a red blanket thrown loosely about the shoulders ; he wore a red sash about his middle , and long leggins of white buckskin elaborately fringed . His moccasins were worked with colored quills . Ma-mongazid began to speak , and Johnston realized that he was meeting Le Pecan Blanc of La @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never appeared . He managed to explaih that he had sent Florentin to them  | eleven days ago , and when they understood this , Waubojeeg dispatched a man to look for him . The man who went was the younger brother of the chief , a handsome man , but not as handsome as his brother . It took him barely five minutes to make his preparations and be gone . By luck , he met Florentin that night , returning to the cabin at St. Michel , and the two of them spent the night there , arriving the next morning at the Red Cliff . The Canadian had not gone to the Red Cliff at all but , frankly disobedient , had hoped to find his old comrades at the Mauvaise . He had thought it more likely that the Canadians would have food than that the Indians would , and he had not intended to desert , but the Canadians were not there . An Indian told him that the Frenchmen had left in the fall . Two men came to get them , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been kind to him , had given him food and shelter and advised him to return to the Red Cliff village . He had stayed at the Mauvaise longer than was necessary because he was very fatigued and they were very kind to him . They had given him enough corn to make the journey home . Waub-ojeeg received Florentin as he had received Johnston . He gave him a place on the bed next to Johnston at the men 's side of the lodge . Wayishkee insisted on keeping the Irishman away from the fire for three weeks . At the end of that time the frozen flesh began to slough away from his feet , and the new skin appeared , healthy and well . The fourth week he was quite restored , and ready to return to the cabin had the weather permitted , but the spring thaws had now set in and the ice was not safe for crossing . Neither was it possible yet to use the canoes . So it happened that Johnston stayed with Waub-ojeeg and his people until May . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sap started running in the maple trees , and the women of the lodge were gone all day , working in the sugar bush .  | They returned at evening , carrying in their clothes and about their persons the scent of wood smoke and syrup . Johnston followed them to the bush one day , walking painfully , and sat upon a bearskin spread on the ground at the foot of one of the trees . The snow was yet everywhere , but softened . The bitterness of winter had melted from the air , and as he sat there , leaning against the trunk of the tree , he heard far and near about him the light , regular ping , ping of the sap dropping into the birchbark buckets . The thin liquid was collected into vats made of deerskins , and from these dipped into the boiling-kettles . Some of these kettles were copper , such as he had brought among his goods , but some were made of bark , and he was astonished that they should hang above a fire hot enough to boil the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form , the thick syrup was poured into other bark containers , set in the snow , and stirred until it assumed the consistency of brown sugar . He watched the women coming and going at a distance , their arms bare , their long black braids bound up at the back of the head in clubs . There were no birds except the winter-staying chickadees , but the voices , the crackling of the fire , and the continual musical dropping of the sap gave to the woods a stir and a feeling of life which had long been absent , and were as beautiful to him as the actual songs of birds . They ate a great deal of fresh sugar in those days . Ma-mongazid told the trader that once when he was quite little and there had not been enough corn in the wigwam he had lived for nearly three months on nothing but maple sugar . " I became very fat , too , " he said , " and shone like a puppy . " It seemed to take the place for these people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mustard and molasses of the New England settlements . The children of the lodge soon became quite free with the visitor . They leaned against him , fingered his  | clothing , and were never tired of wrapping a lock of his strange yellow hair about one of their small bronzy fingers . The warmth and pressure of their bodies pleased him . He liked to watch the coming and going of the women about their work ; the easy domestic affection and confusion of the lodge surrounded him and warmed him . The figures of the lacemakers at Coleraine and the woman seated near the window reading from a tall , red book became delicately united with these figures around the fire . Wayishkee had cut a quantity of bark from the cedars and given it to his mother for mats . The inner bark , now full of sap , was pliable and strong . The woman tore it into strips half an inch wide and six feet long , biting it first to start it , and then ripping it the length of the fiber . The girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to weave them into a mat , an appukwa . There were other such mats on his bed , made in other springs . They were brown and glossy , and very light and strong . The girl , he noticed , resembled her father very much , save that her youth and growing womanliness softened the severer features of the warrior . There were , however , the same hawk nose , the same strong brows and narrow lips , the same carriage of the body . She was tall , also , taller than her mother , almost as tall as Wayishkee , and serious and quiet . With her mother she waited on the men , moving behind them softly ; she had almost full charge of the littlest children . Almost never did she speak to the Irishman , although she sometimes came and stood behind the little boy as he leaned against the trader 's knee , waiting a little , and smiling over the child 's head before she led him away . Wayishkee was teaching him Ojibway . He laughingly corrected the Ottawa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him patiently in the smallest phrases , making him repeat them over and over , insisting on curious aspirations and muted vowels .  | It was neither a d nor a t he would say , but both , neither a k nor a g , but something in between . " You do not want to speak like an Ottawa , " he would say when Florentin was beyond earshot . " An Ottawa is not of importance . " One day Johnston asked him the meaning of his sister 's name . The Indian spread out his hands . He said , " When you are going through thick woods you sometimes come to a place where there are no trees . Do you know ? A green place , nothing but grass , and with trees all around . " " Yes , " said Johnston , " a glade . " " Well , then , that is it . The Woman of that place in the woods . " As Johnston lay that night on the bed of boughs and skins the memory of his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again the sunlight on the bracken in the long glade between the birches , the ferns unruffled , yellow leaves dropping quietly through the still air , and heard far off the wind behind the rampart of the forest . The meaning of the name came to him with a symbolical force , and he saw the daughter of Waub-ojeeg , for a moment , as the glade itself . Perhaps he had already begun to fall in love . He knew that he wanted that tranquillity and seclusion , wanted it for his own , to hold in his arms , to fall asleep in . With May , spring began . He walked in woods that were bare and pure as if the snow and ice had minutely scoured each twig and tree trunk . The leaves of last autumn lay underfoot , beaten together and bleached to the color of the rush mats made by the Woman of the Glade . It was a tissue like wasp nest , breaking crisply . The sunlight was brilliant upon it , and above it the poplar trunks assumed a pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the willow withes a new red bark , which from a distance was a haze like wine . The snow had not disappeared , it had merely given way on the higher ground and the less shaded places . It lay in drifts two and three feet deep under the cedars , and a foot away from it , in the hot sunlight ,  | began the uncurling of the silky yarrow , the furred heads of brake . In the maple bush where the sugar had been made , dogtooth violets were appearing , together with the watery , thick-stemmed , fragile-headed spring beauties . Wayishkee brought from a distance a handful of woody-stemmed arbutus with a fragrance that made the heart stand still for an instant , so eerie was it , so sweet and chill . Then overhead the Indian plum  --  pembina  --  and wild cherry broke into bloom . Pussy willows and poplars were covered with polleny catkins . All the small beasts were changing their fur , and there was no talk of hunting . The deer came close to the village ; he often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were full of white rabbits with a dusting of brown across their backs which seemed like the pollen of spring . The season was incredibly rapid . Nothing in Ireland could have prepared him for so sudden a transformation . Overnight a tree broke into bloom , into leaf ; the young green seemed to whirl upward from the earth , and meanwhile the nights were so cold that an aerial ice descended in imponderable cataracts over flowering shrub and sleeping wigwam . The very water of the lake seemed more fluid and more swift . Through this fragile turmoil , day after day , quiet and deft , moved the figure of the Woman of the Glade . Johnston felt then the full exhilaration of his adventure . He had no wish to return to Ireland or even , for that matter , to Montreal ; he had fully made up his mind to ask the war chief of the Ojibways for the hand of his daughter . It was 1792 . The ferment which in Europe was to produce the Lyrical Ballads and the romance of Atala was working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He walked among the poplars and a hunting song of Wayishkee 's came into his head ? " By the power of flowering plants I lay him low . " He knew that " he " was the quarry , and the " laying low " all other than that which was  | working upon himself ; nevertheless he repeated it to himself many times , transforming it to his own uses . As soon as the water was clear enough for a canoe he sent Florentin in a borrowed craft to the cabin to receive such furs as might be turned in , and to prepare things for their departure . Waub-ojeeg offered to find him four Indian voyageurs , and arrangements were made with an Indian of the village for the construction of a transport canoe . Word had been sent out that the Yellow Haired was at the Red Cliff , and many of the hunters came to him there with their winter 's taking . From the Mauvaise the furs for the credits placed by Leon and Tremblay began to come in , and he found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his men . He watched the construction of his canoe where the stakes were driven on the shore and the bark covering , sewed together with wattap , a thread made from cedar roots , hung loosely between them . The ribs were fitted into it , and shaped by hot stones laid upon the wet wood until it dried . The bark mantle was drawn up about the skeleton thereafter , and bound firmly to the rim , and all the seams were carefully pitched with melted birchbark , to Florentin . He was very happy . The morning of his departure he begged to see Waub-ojeeg in private and asked him with suitable formality for the Woman of the Glade in marriage . The Indian pondered this request for a long time without taking his lips from his pipe , and said at last , after a deliberate exhalation of pale smoke : " Englishman , your color is deceitful . I have watched your people now for many years . You come among us and marry our daughters , and when you are tired of them you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not let you marry my daughter and desert her . But I have watched you and your conduct has been right . I think you are better than the others . I say to you now ,  | go back to Montreal , to your own people , and look among them for a wife . If you do not find a woman who pleases you , and if when the summer is gone you still wish my daughter , return to this place , and I will give her to you . If you take her you must keep her forever , as you would a woman of your own race . I have said . " He rose , opposing his six foot six to Johnston 's five foot ten . In vain did the Irishman protest . The interview was over and Waub-ojeeg was laying aside his pipe . He escorted his guest to the shore with every courtesy , saw that he was well supplied with food for the voyage , and bade him farewell . He did not linger to see the canoe afloat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had stopped at St. Michel for Florentin , and had found there packs bringing his total up to nineteen , all good furs , each pack weighing a full ninety pounds . This gave him , with his men , personal baggage , and provisions , a moderate load of two tons . The transport canoes of that time were built to carry four , an apparent miracle for so frail a vessel . His canoemen were followers of Waub-ojeeg , more skillful with the paddle than the Canadians . They came into the mouth of the Ontonagon , a clear stream with red clay banks , at evening , and were somewhat surprised to find there a large camp of Canadians belonging to a M. Jean Baptiste Perreault , who had that day come down the Ontonagon from the interior , where he had wintered . He had been only forty leagues inland , but the way was so obstructed that it had taken him twenty days , the previous fall , to reach the station . He had come out in much less time , ingenious soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he loaded his packs , and which  | had come down the rapids with no injury , rebounding from rock to rock like so many stuffed leather balls . These curious bowl-like craft were lying bottom up around the fire , for , as he explained , they had to be thoroughly dried every few days or the skins became water-logged and the canoes impracticable . He reported having heard , before he left the interior , a terrific explosion , like thunder but more loud , and seeming to come from within the earth , which reverberated among the mountains in a terrifying fashion . For some days before the occurrence , he said , the weather had been uncommonly still and sultry , and he believed the explosion to have been an earthquake . The encounter was pleasant for Johnston , and he was sorry the next morning to leave the Frenchman , who had still before embarking to repair the birch canoes left en cache at the mouth of the river . with June the mosquitoes began and the nights were spent in misery . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them , but Johnston suffered . As in the spring when he was approaching Mackinac , his face and hands became swollen , and he was slightly feverish . During the day , being far out on the water , they escaped the pest , and at night they did the best they could with a smudge . Beyond the humming maze of insects the spring progressed , constantly swift . Flowers bloomed and fell , a darker green infused the leaves , and by the time they reached Mackinac , late in June , the meadows were rich with daisies , wild roses were in bloom everywhere , and the tremor and fragility of spring had sunk into the security and strength of summer . The first week in July saw the last of the mosquitoes , which breed but once a year in that brief season . Mackinac , with its rocks and cedars , Mackinac was filled with voyageurs , Indians , and traders , the entire  | shore of the bay beneath the fort being occupied by their canoes and wigwams , the latter in rows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlements , the Sault , St. Ignace , Old Mackinac , had come to visit the priest ; and marriages and baptisms , all the ceremonies demanded of life through the winter but postponed till the spring , were celebrated with festivity . John Johnston , Lieutenant Edward Charleton of the Fifth Infantry , and Captain William Doyle stood leaning over the whitewashed stone breastworks at the top of the hill . Between the French village , with its whitewashed log cabins , and the bark wigwams , some conical , some oval , a few fires burning here and there among them , a constant coming and going was taking place . The Canadians , tricked out in shirts of brilliant colors , and with new sashes , the Frenchwomen in bright full-skirted dresses that reached to the ground , were tiny , distinct , and noisy , their gesticulations and their cries floating up from the sunny green purified of meaning . The Indians , quite as brilliantly dressed , though with less uniformity , were more quiet , joined the French , left them . Every one was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Beyond them Lake Huron , under a light breeze , shifted through all the colors of a peacock 's tail to the hue of the serenest summer sky , and back again . On Bois Blanc the leaves of the poplars reversed into silver , and turned over again . Edward Charleton said , " We had a fight here yesterday , oh , quite a brawl . " Doyle , behind him , a long white clay pipe in his hand , leaned forward against the wall , a smile of recognition in his eyes , waiting to hear how Charleton would recount the anecdote . Johnston , a little tipsy from the air , a glass of excellent sherry , and the unaccustomed experience of so much good company , leaned forward also with an expression of interest . " Oh , it was really a serious affair , " said Charleton cheerfully . " I shall have to write a letter about it . An  | Indian attempted to stab a trader . A Chippeway from up in your direction . No doubt he was drunk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much damage being done , but got a nasty cut himself in taking the knife away from the savage . Then they tied the poor fellow 's hands behind his back , and Michel ? I 've no doubt he was drunk too  --  and four or five others pitched upon the poor beast and kicked and stabbed and beat him most unmercifully . I do n't know who all  --  there was an engage named Lambert , and Etienne Campion , Stork , and Campbell ? " " And Georgie Young and Blondeau , " put in Doyle . " Will and myself came up just in time to see the end of it . We pulled them off and had them locked up . Shall have to hold them , I think , until we hear from the Colonel . " " And the Indian ? " suggested Johnston . " Oh , the Indian was done for . Something like it happens every year . It 's a pity they give them so much rum . " A cry came up from below , as two Canadians engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seem very real , purged of its meaning before the delightful scene much as the voices from below were freed of their intention by the distance . In his pocket Johnston had a letter from Andrew Tod , inviting him to join him in a fur-trading project in the Spanish Territory of New Orleans . It did not tempt him much , but it reminded him of something which he had to ask of Doyle , and presently they went back to the stone barracks , the three of them , where , at the long rough table , Doyle wrote out what Johnston requested of him , a grant of land dated July i , 1792 , for three hundred feet on the south side of the river bank at St. Mary 's , running back forty acres in depth , bounded on the northeast by a lot of land belonging to Antoine Landry , and on the southwest by the old Jesuit burying ground .  | Captain William Doyle , Commander of the Twentyfourth British Regiment , in his trim uniform with the narrow scarlet front , standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wrote it out , sanded it , and gave it to Johnston , and when he had finished Charleton took the quill and laboriously wrote his report to Colonel England of yesterday 's fracas . . . " on which the Savage was overpowered and secured from doing eney injury by tying his hands behind his back . . who kicked Beat stabed and Tomahawked him untill they perceived me accompanied by Capt . Doyle . . . . Michilimakina , dated July 1 , 1792 . . . signed Edw . Charlton , Capt , 5th Reg't Com'g . " An Indian girl came in as he was writing and built a fire , and when he had finished they brought out another bottle of sherry . It did not trouble any of the three that Doyle had bestowed a grant in the King 's name for territory ceded almost ten years before in the Treaty of Paris to the United States . The letters which had waited for Johnston at the offices of Tod , Magill and Company , accumulating month by month all winter , from New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sat in O'Sullivan 's Coffee House , where the previous fall he had encountered his old friend Andrew Tod , and slowly broke the seals and slowly read them . By and by he called for pen and ink and began a joint letter to his mother and his Aunt Nancy , a letter which called for all his epistolary skill and all his natural tact . He set forth in glowing terms his plans for the next winter ; he spoke of the beauty and richness of the country ; he mentioned lightly the hardships it was necessary to endure ; and he finally announced that he was about to wed the daughter of an Indian chief . He made it quite plain that he was no squaw man , that this was to be an alliance between two noble houses ; he praised the beauty of his lady , and her virtue , and he promised to bring her to  | Ireland one day . He wrote also to his brother Will . He sent his letters off , but could not hope to wait for an answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring . On the Champ de Mars that summer there was much talk of the possibility of a war between France and England or , as the royalists preferred to phrase it , between England and the Republic , a war of liberation for a king who lay in prison . The French ladies made it a point of loyalty to powder their hair , although English gentlemen were forsaking the custom . There had been riots in the Vendee , he learned , and France had that spring declared war upon Austria . The stiff brocades and high heels urged on the war ; the McTavishes , the McGillivrays , the Tods and Magills , in their neat , bottlegreen smallclothes , their high-lapeled coats , their snowy stocks and short , unpowdered hair , with an eye to the hazards of shipping and the profits of the beaver trade , offered the opinion that a nation should be allowed to go as crazy as it liked , provided it did so at home , and prayed that the ministers of England might feel the same way about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drew up new contracts for new engages , made the purchases necessary for another Indian winter . The wedding gifts to Waub-ojeeg for his daughter were among the most important of these ; there were also gifts for the bride herself , among them one purely quixotic , and which was to cause him no little trouble on the journey north , a stove  --  not a large one , it is true , but still of iron , and inexpressibly awkward in all those loadings and unloadings of the Ottawa River route . The men who carried the pieces threatened to leave him at every second portage . Pleasant as it would have been to linger , he was off again before the summer was well advanced . The journey was much less trying at that time of year than in late May or June . There were no mosquitoes . At the  | Sault he added one more man to his outfit , young Michel Cadotte , a half-breed born at the Sault and friendly with the Ojibways , who proved to be remarkably dependable . VII AT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once more for the Mide ceremonials . Waubojeeg was not well . He performed his part as usual in the sacred rites , but he returned at evening from the long day of dancing and singing very tired . The Woman of the Glade knew about the Irishman 's offer . At first it had amused her , but later it worried her ; she was afraid that her father would give his consent . She told her mother of her fears , and her grandmother , overhearing , said : " It is time the child made an apowa . She is already old never to have made one . This is a sacred time when the manidos are here because of the Mide , and she would surely have the right sort of dream . " So it happened that Ozhah-guscoday-wayquay began her fasting . On a hill at a little distance from the village but quite out of sight she built herself a small lodge of cedar boughs , covering the ground inside with cedar boughs also . Then she painted her face black , and having curtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to sleep . The first day it was very difficult . She lay staring up at the layered green roof through which the sunlight filtered minutely and thought of the perils of marrying a white man . Pale green cedar berries clung to the under side of the twigs , smooth and shaped like little shells the two valves of which would open when they were brown and dry . She became very hungry , and even more restless than she was hungry . The day was long , although at nightfall her grandmother brought her a bowl of water and went  | away without speaking . The second day the hunger seemed to have left her , and she was not so restless . She was very lonely , however , and not a little awed at the idea of awaiting the visit of a spirit . She heard , far away , the sound of the village , the drum , beginning and ceasing , beginning again . She fell asleep in the afternoon and did not waken until after dark . An owl came and hooted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was glad . On the seventh day , she dreamed that a white man came to her , carrying a cup of water . He said , " Poor thing , why are you tormenting yourself ? Take this and drink . " He was accompanied by a dog who laid his head on her knee and looked up into her face as if he knew her . The dream repeated itself three times . Then she dreamed that she was seated on a hill overlooking water and she saw upon the water many canoes filled with Indians coming to her to pay her honor . The dream changed , and she was looking down upon a country filled with flame , like a great forest fire . She cried out , " My people ! My people will all be destroyed ! " Then a voice spoke to her , saying , " They will not be destroyed , they will all be saved . " She knew the voice for that of a spirit , for the accents were not human . Then she woke and saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to rise and go home , but she was very weak , and she fell asleep once more . In the middle of the morning she was wakened by her grandmother , who had come to bring her water , and when she had told her dream the old woman was very pleased and went back to the long lodge to prepare them for the girl 's return . Meanwhile the Woman of the Glade filled her arms with cedar branches from her lodge , and throwing them on the ground before her as she went , trod on them , and came to her father 's lodge . She entered the lodge , still casting the cedar boughs before her and walking on them , and having spread a  | few of them in her old place beside her mother , seated herself upon them . Her grandmother had gathered bitter herbs , laying , when she had drawn them from the earth , a small pinch of tobacco in each hole as an offering to that other , older Grandmother . These herbs were boiled with corn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten days she ate nothing else ; for another ten days she ate nothing but smoked meat . After that she washed the black from her face , and came and went about the lodge as usual , partaking of the food of her family , and performing her usual tasks . Soon after the return of the Irishman the wedding took place which united John Johnston , Esquire , to the Woman of the Glade , daughter of the White Fisher , and granddaughter of Ma-mongazid , the Big Foot . The ceremony began with the exchange of presents : calico , ammunition , and blankets from Johnston , furs from Waub-ojeeg . Then Johnston went to the lodge erected for him for this occasion , and seated himself behind the fire . Waub-ojeeg took his daughter by the hand , and in the presence of witnesses led her around the fire and bade her sit down beside her husband . He then made a long and dignified oration in which he instructed the girl in her duties as a wife , Johnston in his duties as a husband . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sacred will in his behalf , the story of the dream was repeated . He made Johnston swear to take the girl forever , in the manner of the white men , and to have no other wives , and ended by saying : " I feel that I am soon going away to join my fathers , my mother , and my elder brother in that country where Chibiabos is ruler , and I am happy to leave my daughter in the wigwam of an upright man . " Simple as this ceremony was , Johnston found it very touching . He grasped the Indian firmly by the hand and thanked him heartily for the honor done him . The next  | day the wedding feast began , according to the timehonored custom introduced by Manabozho , and the whole village played at boggatiway , which the French call lacrosse , the women playing together according to one set of rules , the men according to another . On the second day there were races and dancing , and on the third day dancing again . Wayishkee beat his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven the walker , The bright sun walking around . Do you hear the noise he is making ? The red bird is making a noise . In heaven the walker , In heaven the walker , In heaven the walker Is looking this way . They went to Ile St. Michel , to the cabin built the winter before . Florentin had been there and had made all straight according to his notions . The new stove was set up in front of the fireplace , the bed was filled with fresh balsam and spread with the gayest blankets . There was even a wedding present for them , a bag of wild rice with a nosegay on top . Johnston called her attention to it , smiling with pleasure ; it was as if he were again among the beguiling peasants of Antrim . The Woman of the Glade looked at Florentin 's offering . She looked at the stove and the bed , and then , drawing her blanket over her head , she went into the farthest corner of the cabin and lay down on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was growing late and the air chilly , he built a fire in the stove and put a kettle on to boil . He unwrapped the presents he had bought for her in Montreal and laid them on the bed , setting  | the little ivory comb on a piece of scarlet cloth so that its delicate shape was clear to see . Then he called to her to come and look at them . She gave no answer . For a while he waited , hovering over his gifts and glancing at the quiet figure in the corner , and then , taking the comb , went softly over and knelt beside her . " Look , sweetheart , " he said , in Ojibway , having learned the word especially for this occasion , " look ! " But his wife turned her head , laying her face close against the floor , and answered not a syllable . He busied himself in preparing supper , setting the food when it was ready on the table against the wall , and still the child in the corner made no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table and set it on the floor in the center of the room , and then , remembering that the Ojibway women never touched their food until the men had finished , he ate his wedding supper . After supper he went for water to the lake , and when he returned observed that a little of the food was gone , although in her corner Ozhah-guscodaywayquay lay rolled in her blanket as before . He cleared away the dishes , and as he was doing so his men appeared , led by Florentin . They had come to wish him well , and to share in any festivities that might be going forward . He met them at the door , his finger on his lips , and , indicating the figure in the corner , welcomed them , shaking each one by the hand . They tiptoed into the room and were given each a noggin of rum and a half a carrot of tobacco . When they had finished their drinks , and wiped their mouths on the backs of their hands , they again saluted their host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly as they could . Johnston sat down before the stove and waited . At bedtime he collected the presents , laid them in a little pile near his wife , spread an additional blanket over her shoulders , and laid himself down on the fresh balsam , under the new blankets , alone .  | The next day the same performance was repeated . Half distressed , half amused , Johnston went about his usual business , left the house for an hour or more whenever he had prepared a meal , received his usual visitors , went over his accounts . He gave his men orders , which they took with perfect good nature , not to go near the house . For ten days she neither spoke to him nor showed him her face . He had been in love when he married her , and each succeeding day his pity and tenderness increased , until , on the tenth day , he was nearly out of his wits . He sat on the doorstep with his head in his hands , repeating to himself , " An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be beaten . " At last , remembering that she was indeed his wife , and according to her own tradition owed him certain duties even as he owed her sustenance and protection , he resolved to be firm , and approaching her commanded her gravely to rise and tend the fire . She stood up obediently , the blanket falling back from her head to her young shoulders . " Look , " he said , " this is where you will put the wood . " The fire did not in the least need mending , in actual fact . He had forgotten that ; and as he lifted the black iron lid from the stove a flame shot upward like the tongue of a serpent . She had stood quietly until he opened the stove , but at that dreadful apparition she brushed suddenly past him and was gone through the door . He followed , and saw her running down the shore to the south . Even in his dismay he thought , " She runs like a deer . No woman in Montreal or Dublin could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the furs given him by Waub-ojeeg . He had no heart to pursue her , and he did not think that she would ever return . Therefore , one morning a week after her flight , great was his surprise to behold a canoe approaching the shore in which were Waub-ojeeg , Ma-mongazid , and the Woman of the Glade . They disembarked and came  | up the path to the cabin , the two men heavily laden with choice peltries and mokkuks of corn . The girl said not a word but went into the house . Waub-ojeeg laid his furs at Johnston 's feet , Ma-mongazid did likewise , and folding his arms across his breast , Waub-ojeeg said : " My son , I am full of humility . Never did I dream I should own so disobedient a daughter . Accept these furs as token of my sorrow , and take back my disobedient daughter . She will never disgrace me again . If she leaves you again I will cut off her ears . I have told her so . Already I have beaten her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very sad to talk of such things , but I have given her to you , and what I give I do not take back again . " My son , I was away hunting , but I dreamed a dream . I saw my daughter in the wigwam of my father . She had been many days in the woods , she was tired and hungry , she had brought unhappiness upon herself . I knew then that she had run away from you . " My son , I left my traps . I came two days ' journey down the Montreal to the wigwam of my father . When I entered it I saw her sitting there beside the fire even as in my dream . Then I beat her with a stick , and now I give her back to you . " He turned and without a word of farewell went down to the canoe . The old man lingered for a moment , tapped Johnston lightly on the arm as if to say , " It will be all right , she will come around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was true ; she never tried to run away again . After a few days she twisted her braids into a knot at the back of her head and pinned them with the ivory comb . She laid the three-cornered red shawl about her shoulders , crossing the ends over her bosom , and tucked them in her belt . She went about the ordinary tasks of an Indian woman , and gradually her fear of the Yellow Haired became affection and then love . They were very  | happy . Upon one thing only she insisted : she wanted the stove removed , and after a little arguing Johnston took it down and set it out of doors , where it gradually became red with rust . The Woman of the Glade did her cooking at the fireplace . He noticed that she never crossed before him or sat in the place in which he was accustomed to sit . For any noise she made he would hardly have known she was there , but he delighted to watch her . She was very beautiful , like the austere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features with gentleness as the spring twilights made delicate and dreaming the shapes of rocks and gaunt pines . The voyageurs noticed her beauty and told her children of it years afterward . Her husband wished to treat her as he would have treated an Irishwoman of his own rank , but she did not always permit him to do so . She refused consistently to eat anything until he should have finished his meal , waiting on him as she had done at the Red Cliff , and in all the years they were married he never persuaded her to relinquish this custom . She assumed many small labors which he would never have thought of delegating to her , and took full charge of all things pertaining to their comfort in the house . She gathered wood , she carried water , she skinned and prepared game , she scraped another deerskin and made a second window , she set snares for rabbits , she kept the cabin neat . After the fantastic behavior of the first few weeks there was no one more practical than she . Fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been fairly constant in their visits through the autumn , came less often and when they did , came as guests , to smoke and tell stories and stay a night or two or a week . They brought gifts of fish or game and received gifts of tobacco , cloth , or any little trinket that might please them . They came without invitation , they entered without knocking , they stayed as long as they  | pleased , but they were quiet , courteous , and even thoughtful . Sometimes they slept on the floor in the Johnstons ' kitchen , sometimes in the men 's house . Waubojeeg himself was among these visitors . Johnston felt that the attitude of the Indians had changed toward him , and realized in himself also a changed attitude . A corner of the blanket of Waub-ojeeg had descended upon his shoulders , involving , besides the greater favor of the Indians , greater responsibilities . He took pains to pay them in good measure for their pelts , and there was no talk this year of their going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left for Montreal , he took with him twenty-four packs of prime furs . He had made his plans for the summer knowing that in the fall the Woman of the Glade would be delivered of a child . He left her in her father 's lodge , hoping , if all went well with his journey , to return for her and take her in October to a new house at the Falls of St. Mary 's . The night of the sixteenth of October , 1793 , was cold ; frost lay on the leaves , and toward Chegoimegon long points of white mist floated on the surface of the bay where the waters had given forth their day 's meager warmth . In the sky the stars were like suspended snow . Johnston walked slowly back and forth on the beach of St. Michel , between the liquid chillness of the waves and the uneven shadow of the woods . The pines , plumed and unwithering , rose above the empty twiggy branches of birch and hazel , and under their shadow he could make out the conical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storehouse and kitchen . At this hour there was no light above it , but above the large one , and above the small one set at a distance , inverted cones of firelight were reflected , and occasional flights of sparks , all golden in the blackness , whirled and disappeared . He heard at last the cry " N'yah , N'yah , " the traditional  | woman 's exclamation of pain , astonishment , or joy , saw at last the curtain blanket of the smaller lodge flung aside from within , and as the figure of a little girl darted out and across the clearing toward the central wigwam , he knew that he was sent for . The interior of the women 's lodge held a curious compounded odor . He was aware , in the unsteady golden light , of the texture of appukwa and bark sloping down to shelter a circle of ground spread with balsam branches and furs ; a litter of . mokkuks , blankets , and woven fiber bags , near the edges , near the fire a basswood bowl full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bear 's tallow . Beyond the fire the Woman of the Glade lay with half-open eyes , staring into the fire , her face relaxed and happy . At her feet sat the old woman , Waub-ojeeg 's first wife , who now and again patted the girl gently on the ankles , or , rising on her knees , adjusted the blankets closer to the long body that was now flat and slender as it had been nine months ago . The baby was naked on a pile of furs almost directly at its father 's feet , kicking feebly as its grandmother rubbed it with tallow . It was neither white nor brown as yet , but the universal sullen red worn by all babies , yellow , brown , or white , when they enter this world . It opened its slaty-blue eyes and looked at its father angrily . The grandmother , who was not many years older than thirty , said proudly , " It is a son . " Later , having been thoroughly greased , wrapped in rabbit fur , and packed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of which the flat back , prolonged beyond the head and surmounted with an arch , surrounded the baby 's face with a stiff archaic halo , the namesake of the Bishop of Belfast was brought to his father and grandfather in the wigwam of Waub-ojeeg , displayed , and taken back to his mother . The village at Chegoimegon had been deserted for some weeks , and Waub-ojeeg was delaying his departure  | for the Wisakoda only until Johnston and his wife should set off for St. Mary 's . At the trader 's return , a week ago , the long lodge at Chegoimegon had been dismantled , and Waub-ojeeg 's people , crossing to St. Michel , had set up the cluster of smaller wigwams , devoting one of them to Ozhah-guscoday-wayquay and her mother . Now that the child was born , they began to count the days before it might be possible for her to travel . In late September and early October the weather had been changeable and violent , and even now , Johnston , hearing the lake roaring behind the pines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin , eddying between the denuded hazel branches , wondered if they would be able to make the journey that season . During the day Waub-ojeeg sat at the door of his lodge , his red-bowled pipe with its long stem of reed resting on his knee , smoking and watching the women as they threshed and cured in smoke the wild rice gathered the month before . They poured the grain into shallow holes lined with deerskin , treading it or beating it with paddles , and winnowed it afterward in the gale blowing in from the lake . The Woman of the Glade , lying in her wigwam , with the child hung near her in his cradle , could see and hear them ; they chattered like squirrels . In the evening Waub-ojeeg from his place behind the fire on the low platform smoked and told stories or questioned the Irishman . " My grandfather , " said Waub-ojeeg , " was Nokay , also a chief . In one day 's hunting at Crow-wing River he killed " ? Waub-ojeeg held up his hand with the fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand finger by finger , enumerating the items ? " four buffalo , five deer , three bears , one lynx , one porcupine . He was a hunter . " Or he said : " Four days ' journey on the other side of the Riviere Bride , to the west and to the south , in the mountains there are very fine maple woods . We were there two years ago in March to make our sugar .  | My daughter "  --  he used the single word which signifies eldest daughter ? " was then fourteen years old . She was with her cousin who was a woman seventeen years old . They were in the woods by themselves , they were climbing the mountain , they came to a cliff , straight " ? he motioned with his hand ? " and very high and standing so that the sun at morning shone on it clear . Here they sat down to pick wintergreen leaves and here they found what I am going to tell you about , a piece of yellow metal very smooth and flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the air a brick or slab about four inches thick , a foot broad , and a foot arid a half long . " They tried to lift it , and the two of them together could raise it only a little . They were very puzzled . Then my niece said to my daughter , It belongs to Gitche Manido , ' and they were frightened and ran away . " He paused , lifting his pipestem level with his forehead . " My friend , what was it ? You are a wise man . Tell me what is was . " " It may have been a block of hammered copper , " said Johnston . " The copper of this country is often very yellow . " " Can not two strong women lift a piece of copper of that size ? " returned the Indian scornfully . " I say that they could not lift it . " " Could it have been gold , then ? " " I do not say . I have not traveled . I have not seen much gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ask you , who are wise . I see that you do not believe me . Very well , my friend , in the spring I will make my sugar at that place , and in May I will bring you that piece of yellow metal . " Johnston slept that night to a vision of Peruvians worshiping the sun at an altar of gold on a cliff side in the Porcupine Mountains . He had heard instances of trade carried on among the tribes of the interior from the borders of Mexico to Hudson 's Bay , and stories of Ottawa women found on the plains of Tartary , having  | been captured and sold from tribe to tribe across the Bering Straits , and it seemed not impossible to him , as the lodge poles vibrated slightly in the wind , and leaves and small branches were swept against the side of the lodge , and Waub-ojeeg and his people slept in the dying firelight , that a band of the Inca Indians should have traveled so far and carried with them so great a quantity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to worship under a strange cliff in sight of glacial waters . On another evening they talked of the Christian mystery . " I understand you , " said the Indian , " when you say that your god becomes bread and that yo " eat of the bread , not to eat your god but his godliness . We too when we eat of the heart of a brave man eat not the heart but the courage . There is no Ojibway who would taste of the blood of a coward . " And again : " We are like you . First there is Gitche Manido , the Great Spirit , the Master of Life . Then there is Gheezhay Manido , the Merciful One . Then there is Manabozho who interceded for the red man and brought him the Mide ritual so that he might live again after dying here ; then there are all the other manidos , the eight winds , the sun , the moon , the bear , the earth , many manidos . There are also the manidos underground which Manabozho made before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the mudji manidos . But we have no hell . If the Master of Life made a hereafter of fire he made it for the white man , not for us . " He smiled , the long lips tightening slowly , slowly relaxing . He went on : " Do you know what Gitche Manido said when he had finished making the white man ? He said , Now you shall buy land and sell land , always buying and selling . ' For my people the land used to be free , always growing , michigan , the growing land that Manabozho made . When he put more animals on the land , they ran around and it grew . Now I think the land has stopped growing . "  | With great regularity the child , Lewis Saurin Johnston , was brought to see his father and grandfather , since Waub-ojeeg never entered the lodge where his daughter lay , although he took great pleasure in his grandson . The face of the child was a soft brown , and silky as the inside of a milkweed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with blue , the iris indistinct , the little pupils inky black , widening and contracting as they were turned towards or away from the fire . One evening as the grandmother was taking the child back to his mother , his grandfather said , softly , affectionately , " Very soon he will be doing the only thing that Manabozho could never do . You will be proud of him then . " " And what was that ? " asked Johnston innocently . " Manabozho could not put his toe in his mouth . " On the morning of the tenth day the Woman of the Glade announced herself strong enough to travel . For some time all had been prepared , the mokkuks of smoked rice and of fish and of bear tallow made ready , and Waub-ojeeg , having delayed long , was anxious to be gone to the Mauvaise . In less than an hour the lodges were dismantled , the poles , first , laid in the canoes , on them the furs and blankets , the rolls of mats , and the various bundles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lake , and then Johnston and his voyageurs turned to the south , Waub-ojeeg and his people to the north , and the Woman of the Glade was with Johnston . It was the beginning of November as they moved down toward Kewenaw . The storms which Johnston had encountered on his trip up the lake and which he had dreaded for this journey with the young mother , all had disappeared . The violent winds had stripped the trees , had startled the wild fowl and sent the wild geese honking overhead , had swept and scoured the sky and water , and now they were fallen ; and in a quiet more dreaming  | than that of summer , day after sunny day they moved along , the lake rocking so gently that the paddles of the men hardly splashed . The Woman of the Glade half lay and half sat on the floor of the canoe , furs beneath her and a roll of blankets at her back , the cradle of her son leaning against the cedar thwart . She felt the motion of the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving over the motion of the retarded waves , a movement as familiar to her as that of her own body walking . The lake never changed ; the shore , though changing , was always ' her own country , and at night and at early morning she saw the familiar pattern of the Fisher stars swinging in their wide circle around the fixed polestar . Every night her lodge was built and carpeted ; she slept under the appukwas she had woven as a girl . The men sometimes sang , always in French ; she could speak with them in French if she chose , or to her husband in Ojibway , which he now understood very well . The small face of her child was a constant delight , and the joy with which , having unfastened the wrappings of his cradle , she laid him to her breast was almost as sharp as the pain she had felt in bearing him . If they had wind it was the northwest wind , the Keewaydin , blowing against the men 's shoulders , and she remembered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going in the direction of the wind . Their journey lasted three weeks . One afternoon ; in a haze as if the smoke of all the councils of the century had hung undispelled above the trees and water , they rounded Cape Iroquois , where the bones of her ancestors ' enemies lay whitening and uninterred upon the sand , and she heard for the first time in her life , far away , the sound of the rapids .  | VIII THEY were there in a landscape so unmarred that it seems , from this distance , a time of early morning . There were the rapids , entire and fresh , the whole half mile of glancing water , set here and there with islands , unfettered , unobliterated , and harboring in the still , swift water at their foot thousands of whitefish , of a size , and their flesh of a delicacy , no longer to be met with . The place was called by the Ojibways , Bawating , the Place of Water Tumbling over Stones ; the French had called it a Sault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has designated them as " a sprightly and active people , " perhaps Leapers would be a more accurate term for them than Men of the Leap . Men of the Rapids they truly were , however , to be seen any day in the summer or early fall , gliding down the watery toboggan , or waiting , the canoe poised momentarily against the deep current at the foot , one man at the paddle , another with a foot on each gunwale of the canoe , a long-handled net in his hand , peering into the unruffled green translucency for the long white body and silver fins of the fish they called the reindeer of the water . For the distance of a mile the rumble of the rapids could be heard , a sound not so deadening and terrifying as the roar of Niagara , which has kept people from sleeping and sometimes unsettled their reason , but a refreshing , vigorous splashing and rushing , not too loud to spoil the sound of wind in the grass or of voices or bird calls , and over which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in undiminished force . Many people have wondered , from the days of the first Frenchmen to the present , at the shallowness of the rapids , considering that behind them is all the vast body of Superior 's icy water , and the conclusion has been , by Indians as well as white men , that the great lake seeps away through subterranean  | channels . Indians will show you this day springs on rocky islands farther down in the St. Mary 's River , which , they say , because of their coldness , surpassing even the coldness of the river , are fed by rifts in the foundations of the earth directly from the bottom of Superior . At any rate , there below the steady blueness of the lake was this beautiful , dangerous , shallow spillway , refreshing all the air with its breeze , as it were , providing to any one who had a net and a steady arm quantities of the most delicious food imaginable , and blocking the free passage of the voyageur with his heavily laden canoe , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place for traders , trappers , and fishermen . A narrow footpath for towing and portaging led along the southern edge of the Sault , picking its way carefully on a slight rocky elevation . East of this was the site of the Old French Fort , which burned at Christmas time , 1762 , and at the eastern edge of this again was the log house of Jean Baptiste Cadotte , spared by the fire , and in which Cadotte then lived . Still moving eastward , one came to the Jesuit cemetery , a garden planted by Father Marquette , Father Allouez , and Father Dablon , of dark-leaved plants with vermilion petals , sweet with the odor of sanctity , the garden plots themselves low under daisies in June , under mallow in August , in October under goldenrod and pale blue asters . This garden-graveyard was the southwestern boundary of Johnston 's land . Before it lay the river , wide and tranquil after its swift descent , moving away to embrace the numberless islands of its downward channel ; behind it lay the Indian green ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the river , running back forty acres in depth , bounded on the northeast by a lot of land belonging to Antoine Landry , " to be held during the pleasure of His Majesty and of the governor or commander-in-chief of Upper Canada . "  | Landry , who was he ? His name comes down to us on a piece of paper held as the first recorded deed of land in Chippewa Township . He probably looked like La Liberte , and wore a red worsted belt about his middle , worsted from an habitant wheel . They were there among the dustless , sharp-needled pines , the unlettered , ripplemarked beaches , the flowering meadows , and their nearest neighbor was Jean Baptiste Cadotte , the old steward of the Chevalier de Repentigny , loyal servant of King Louis the Fifteenth of France , God rest his bones . This same Cadotte was a son of a Cadieu , or Cadot , whose father came to the Sault from France with the Sieur de St. Lusson . His mother was an Ojibway , and in due time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jean Baptiste the younger , and Michel , Johnston 's Michel . When the Chevalier arrived to take possession of his grant , in 1751 , there was Cadotte . The animals brought from Michilimackinac , " a bull , two bullocks , three cows , two heifers , one horse and a mare , " were put in the charge of Cadotte , and so also were the acres cleared and planted with corn , of which they expected to harvest that first year " from thirty to thirtyfive bushels . " And when the Chevalier departed in 1759 to go to the aid of the French garrison besieged at Niagara by Sir William Johnson of the Mohawks , Cadotte remained in charge . News came to the Sault some months later that de Repentigny had been taken prisoner by Sir William , and later still , that the King of England had offered him rewards if he would become a British subject , but that the Chevalier had refused . Then no more was heard , and a young English trader by the name of Alexander Henry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cadotte 's partner in the fur trade . Since the English troops , who came in the summer of that year to establish a British garrison at the Sault , found Cadotte to be a friend of Henry 's , they did not disturb him in his log house and garden , but took possession of  | the fort and began to lay in a winter 's supply of fish . Three days before Christmas the fort burned , storehouse , stockade , and all  --  all but Cadotte 's cabin  --  and , provisionless and shelterless , the men saw no other course open them save flight to Mackinac . By some miracle the river was open for canoes , and they left at once , all save the Lieutenant , who was too badly burned to travel . So it happened that Henry and Lieutenant Jemette wintered with Cadotte . Johnston had not been two years in the Indian country without hearing the remarkable story of Alexander Henry , and he had seen Henry himself at Montreal , a white-haired man whose digestion was not all that it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrunken little Frenchman , as they went among the cattle to select a milch cow for Johnston , or as they stood on the meadow near the shore , discussing timber and foundations , suddenly refer , as to events of a year ago , to that disastrous winter and the even more difficult winter which followed . He was confused as to sequences of events , occasionally ; he sometimes even transferred the adventures of one man to another . But what he lacked in coherence he made up for in the accuracy of his separate recollections , and his very obliqueness ended by adding to the final vividness . In February of that winter , Jemette being considered sufficiently recovered to travel , Henry had set out with him for Mackinac , the old Mackinac on the mainland . That was a terrible journey . " My friend , " said Cadotte , " they were seven days in reaching the Grand Detour , seven days , one whole Christian week . And after that , to wait there in the snow with no food but a little pork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way back to me , here at the Sault , for more food , and then to go across on the ice , across those straits ? My friend , in February those straits are very terrible  --  all the while suffering from burns , here  | and here , almost over all his body , for what ? To be scalped in June . Stabbed and scalped . But Henry , with his Indian friend . . . Ah , it is very strange , my friend , how some things happen to one man , some to another . That year we see Monsieur Henry here at the Sault once more , and we make sugar together . Sixteen or seventeen hundred weight of sugar , certainly . Then Henry goes back to Michilimackinac , and he is there when Monsieur Jemette is killed . You know all that . We did not see him again for a year , we are sure he is dead , and all the time he is with that Indian brother of his . It was my wife who found him and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say : " My friend , when you suffer from le mal de raquette you must do the right thing . There is only one thing to do and it is difficult . You must light a piece of touchwood and lay it upon the tendons of the leg . There you must leave it until the flesh is well burnt , bien brille . This Henry did not do , and that March in coming back from Michilimackinac his snowshoes made him much pain . He was afraid to cure himself and he suffered . " To such an accompaniment Johnston built his house , sent out his commis to their various stations along the southern shore , and established a small fur press between his house and the river front . He had brought books from Montreal on his last trip , together with many other luxuries  --  dishes , mirrors , and a few small panes of glass for a window . And to such neighbors , such a scene , he brought his young wife and her son . It was not Athanasie , however , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry , who came in that far-away November with a cup of milk for the Woman of the Glade , but Marie Mouet , Cadotte 's second wife , a woman slightly over forty , experienced and kind . The Woman of the Glade held the wooden cup in her dark fingers and , smiling at the smooth warm surface of the liquid ,  | said to Marie Mouet in French , " It is the first milk I drink since I leave the breast of my mother . " At the end of the month the last Montreal Express , on its way from Grand Portage , stayed with them overnight and told them of the assassination of Marat and of the progress of the war with France , and went on in the morning with its packets of sealed letters , leaving them to their winter silences . IX WORD having passed from village to village , from one band of hunters to the next , through the deep snow , the message finally reached the Sault where the Woman of the Glade heard it , seated before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms . Waub-ojeeg-e-bun . The White Fisher was . The Indian who brought it from the village sat on his heels , his hands dropped loosely before him between his knees , his eyes on the face of the young woman who stared quietly into the fire , motionless . After a time he said , " You will call it Wayishkee ? " " It has . already a name , " she answered , and to Johnston , who waited behind them , " Tell him . " " Lewis , " said Johnston . The Indian looked blank . " En francais , Louis , " said Johnston . " Oh , " came the slow response , " like the French king , Nouis . " Johnston nodded , and beckoning to the Indian , led him into the kitchen , where he made him a gift of sugar , flour , and a small glass of wine , and let him out of the house by the kitchen door . Waub-ojeeg had died in the late autumn . The Woman of the Glade sat by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths since her girlhood , going with her mother and stepmother to help prepare the dead , but this was the first death of great personal importance . She did not need to  | see her father to know how he looked . His long frame , stretched on the bed of skins , would be clothed in the fringed white buckskin suit of the Mide ceremonials , and his face would be painted , green and white and black , according to the ancient ritual imposed by Manibush . He would not be buried , not because of the hardness of the winter earth , but because it was not a custom of his people , although many had become converted to earth burial since the coming of the French priests . His body would be incased in those mats of reed , of cedar , which his women had woven in happier hours , in the frail days of spring , and thus stiffly enshrouded would be set on high above the beaches of Chegoimegon on a scaffold in the trees . Years later the bones would be interred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burying pit , the walls of which would be lined with valuable furs and presents of wampum and copper . Meanwhile , the Mide ritual would not be neglected , nor the four nights ' fire , nor the gifts of food and implements . Wayishkee would become the head of the family , deferring always to his mother in matters of importance , and in the spring , in the spring the reeds would be green about the mouths of the small rivers and creeks , and her mother and the old woman would go among them in the small canoe . A wish as profound as life rose in her body to see her people and the sand beaches of Chegoimegon in the spring . Johnston had come back into the room . He sat down behind her in the armchair that was reserved for his special use , and said nothing . The Woman of the Glade continued to search the fire with her eyes as if this universal element , ever the same , here , at La Pointe , ever fresh in spite of its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commemorative sequence in her mind . She was remembering the stories which had surrounded her father in his lifetime , and which became solidified into legend , as it were , upon his death . He had  | gone , when he was a little boy , with his father to hunt in that middle ground between the accepted Sioux territory and that accepted as Ojibway . It was autumn . Her grandfather Ma-mongazid was a young man , confident and straight , and he had brought all his family with him . His lodge , covered with cedar bark , and gray and shaggy in appearance , stood in a hazel thicket ; the leaves were yellow , spotted with brown , and falling from the branches . Squirrels stripped the fuzzy husks from the small nuts and ran away with their cheeks bulging . The boughs shook under them , and in the lodge , separated from their light racket by the narrow thickness of the cedar bark , were all the customary morning sounds of a family . Suddenly a shot was fired , then another . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two branches , magnified . A dog screamed , and a young man came running into the lodge , where he dropped , holding the upper part of his body from the ground with his elbows , but dragging the lower part as he tried to crawl forward , for he had been shot in the thigh . The dog had been killed . A woman , her grandmother , who had been cutting meat into strips for smoking , sprang to her feet and ran to Ma-mongazid , and Ma-mongazid , putting her aside , went to the door , left the lodge , and standing in plain view , called to his hidden enemies in the Sioux tongue . He asked if Wabasha or his brother were among the attackers , and while the terrified Ojibways waited , the bushes rustled and parted , and a Sioux warrior , some years older than Ma-mongazid , and very tall , appeared and crossed the intervening glade . It was Wabasha , the half brother of Ma-mongazid by an Ojibway mother . He was clad in full war regalia , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ma-mongazid wore only his hunting shirt , and carried no weapon but the knife at his belt . The Sioux and the Ojibway embraced , the Sioux was invited to enter the lodge . He bent his head , did Wabasha ,  | to pass under the looped-back curtain of deerskin ; his feathers brushed the curtain , and before he could lift his head he was struck a violent blow with a war club , yet not so violent that it caused him to fall . He straightened , turning abruptly upon his assailant , not seeing at first in the shaded light who this might be , and encountered a boy of five , who still grasped the club and glowered at the intruder . Wabasha laughed . To those in the lodge the sound was like the first decided rush of rain after a sultry day . Wabasha laughed , and lifting the boy in his arms , began to prophesy . He prophesied a war chief for the Ojibways who should bring terror to the Sioux and whose name should be powerful beyond the Namakagun River until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young Waubojeeg and set him on the ground . Johnston had left his place behind her in the armchair and was lighting a candle , which he carried to the table , and there seated himself . Presently a light scratching noise told her that he was writing , an occupation which she understood , but which interested her little . Again it was autumn , either late autumn or early winter . There was snow on the ground and the streams were frozen , but the winds had not yet stripped every dry leaf from the thickets . Waub-ojeeg was setting marten traps . The Battle of the St. Croix was some years over ; the rocky gorge was quiet , the waters had purified themselves , and the Sioux no longer molested Ojibways gathering rice in the still autumn days . In his lodge were two women  --  his first wife and her son , Wayishkee , the First Born , and her own young mother . In a cradle made of bark and interwoven strips of rabbit skin lay , or leant , according to the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby girl , herself , all the crevices about her tiny body carefully packed with moss in order to hold the little feet , the little back , in  | the posture which should be habitual before she learned to walk . Waub-ojeeg , clad in his hunting shirt and leggins , a short knife at his belt and a small hatchet in his hand , cutting spruce boughs and twisting them to his uses , set forty marten traps , establishing a line for the season , and , having set the last , turned towards home . He had traveled perhaps half the distance between the last trap and the place where his lodge was , when , rounding a small ice-shagged evergreen , he came suddenly upon a moose , which confronted him with its head lowered , and barred his way . A great beast , gray and sulphurous , with curious long lips and intelligent eyes , it stood there , taller than the man , balancing the broad palmate horns before him , and regarded him with a determination and hostility rare to its species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defender for its race . Waub-ojeeg retreated slowly one step , and the moose attacked , lunging heavily in a straight line . The man dodged , circling the evergreen , and found the moose again confronting him . Having no suitable weapon and not being in any great need of meat at the time , he would have been glad to go his way without molesting the beast , but the moose would not permit it . For half an hour the pursuit continued , the moose lunging , the man dodging , until , as he ran , the Indian picked up a long stick , undid the fastenings of one of his moccasins , and with the moccasin string bound his knife to the end of the stick . He then stationed himself behind the trunk of a tree , his lance in his hand , and the moose flung itself upon the knifehead . The blood streamed from its throat , smoking , but the moose , undismayed , reared and plunged again . Again the Indian met him with the lance , and again the blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if to snow , and cleared again , and a wind rose , shaking the withered leaves and lifting the loose snow in feathers , and still the moose , though staggering , pursued the Indian  | and met the lance , and still Waub-ojeeg , bespattered with blood , his breath tasting bitter upon his tongue , his forehead damp with sweat in spite of the cold air , dodged from tree trunk to tree trunk , avoided the skillful colossal horns , and held steady his lance . Finally the moose dropped . Waub-ojeeg approached it , and kneeling before the solemn head , cut out the tongue . He unbound the knife from the stick , put it back in his belt , fastened his moccasin again , and taking the tongue only , set off for home . The women , following his directions , found the place of the fight easily , for the snow was trampled down in a great circle , and trees and snow and bushes were besprinkled with blood as if thirty men had been fighting there . The moose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the memory of any living Ojibway . Now that the moose was dead the woods were quiet . The room was quiet , also . Johnston had finished his writing , but the Woman of the Glade still looked into the fire . She presently felt his hand on her shoulder . " Come , " he said , " it is very late . " What he had written he hesitated to show her then , but left it folded in his portfolio . Death Lament of the White Fisher , by JOHN JOHNSTON , ESQ . My friends , when my spirit is fled  --  is fled , My friends , when my spirit is fled , Ah , put me not bound in the dark and cold ground , Where light shall no longer be shed  --  be shed , Where daylight no more shall be shed . But lay me up scaffolded high  --  all high , Chiefs , lay me up scaffolded high , Where my tribe shall still say , as they point to my clay , He ne'er from the foe sought to fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fly .  | And children who play on the shore  --  the shore , And children who play on the shore , As the war dance they beat , my name shall repeat , And the fate of their chieftain deplore  --  deplore , And the fate of their chieftain deplore . In the spring Michel Cadotte was going to La Pointe , and Johnston , having purchased a small schooner from the Northwest Company , equipped it with goods for the winter 's trade , presents for the Woman of the Glade to give her family , and every small device he could imagine to make the journey easy for her and the child , intrusted her to the care of Michel , and sent her to Chegoimegon to visit her people . THE Northwest Company was at a disadvantage with the Hudson 's Bay Company chiefly in that it had no charter , although the partners had applied for one , but was a common-law company . It had been organized and reorganized tentatively through a number of years from the day in 1779 when Simon McTavish had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one year , nine small fiercely competing companies . In the fur trade , competition meant ruin to the competitors , a fact which held the Northwest together through varying fortunes until 1821 . A smaller company , younger by more than a century , and unchartered , the Northwest nevertheless became a most formidable rival to the Hudson 's Bay , the " Great Company , " partly because of its personnel . Whereas the Hudson 's Bay servitors , clerks and voyageurs both , were Orkney men , stubborn and slow , a stiff-necked generation , the Northwest Company had taken over from the French regime the French half-breeds who knew the forest and its inhabitants ,  | men of an extraordinary character and as if created expressly for the fur trade , gay , dogged , cajoling , loyal . They were the nimble tentacles by which , octopus-like , the tough business authority of the ScotchIrish traders , the McTavishes , McGillivrays , and Mackenzies , penetrated and controlled the wilderness . These were the voyageurs . But any man in the Northwest who indentured himself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was very likely to be one day a partner , so that every man enrolled in the company felt himself a part of it ; his own fortunes and those of the company were inseparable , and the whole outfit , from Jean Baptiste , mangeur de lard , to the " Marquis , " Simon McTavish himself , hung together with a sort of feudal strength . Johnston never took advantage of the occasions which offered to become a part of the company . The recollection of his family 's experience with the Belfast waterworks left him with a disinclination to involve his fortunes in affairs so far beyond his personal control , nor could he very well countenance the idea of signing away his liberty for the term of five years . He remained an independent , as during his first winter , with all the hazards and privileges thereunto appertaining . The Northwest Company flourished . Alexander Mackenzie discovered the river which now bears his name and traveled down it , or up it , as you like , to tidewater , where , although in doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arctic Ocean , he found it necessary to turn back . He returned to the Grand Portage , the primary rendezvous of the Northwest , and told his partners about his trip , but they were too concerned with the reorganization of the company then pending to be much impressed . A few years later he went overland to the Pacific , and inscribed his name and the date on a rock there , on the Pacific shore , in bear grease and vermilion . This also left his partners unimpressed ,  | but Mackenzie himself began to envision a fur company comparable to the great East India Company , a company composed principally of the Hudson 's Bay and the Northwest , trading from coast to coast and from the Arctic to the forty-fifth parallel , an empire company . Simon McTavish , concerned with the more immediate problem of keeping nine squabbling companies at peace , began to be irritated with Mackenzie . The Northwest had been deliberately trading for some years from posts in the United States territory , giving as justification some convenient theory that the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1783 , and the post at St. Mary 's was one of these . Year after year the Northwest canoes landed at the southern shore , were partly unloaded , and taken up through the rapids on the cod line ; year after year the Montreal partners bound for Grand Portage broke their journey at the Sault , and not without revelry ; and year after year John Johnston continued to hold his acres by the grace of God and the King of England . Even the rendezvous of the Grand Portage was in territory belonging to the States . However , in 1798 the Americans had begun to be meticulous about their boundary lines . They threatened to collect customs on all Northwest Company goods , and the Northwest , making the best of a bad business , moved across the rapids to the stony northern shore , where they built docks and warehouses and constructed a small canal , and a lock having a wooden gate and a lift of nine feet . The southern gate was single and operated by a windlass ; the northern gate , carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was double . The whole canal was hardly more than half a mile long , the lock itself thirty-eight feet long by eight feet nine inches wide , just large enough for the great transport canoes , thirty-six feet long and from six to seven feet wide . Nine feet subtracted from the twenty-one-foot  | drop of the rapids was not a great deal , it is true , but it eliminated the most difficult part of the course and allowed canoes to go up fully loaded , towed by oxen along the corduroy road from the head of the locks to the canal . The company also built a sawmill to be operated by water power from a short canal parallel to the lock . These were improvements , but the men continued to complain that the lower part of the Northwest 's property was as likely as not to be under water half the time , and they regretted the move . Johnston had not the heart to move . He continued to consider himself British , but for his purposes the northern shore was out of the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gardens and plowed fields , his fruit trees and his seven years ' labor ? Moreover , at this distance from Washington , from London , in a land so intrinsically wild , the reality of the affixed boundaries was not great . Why , he felt , should not some day some other treaty , no more remote than that of Paris , return to the crown , and as easily , what the Treaty of Paris had taken away ? The Northwest continued to flourish , and McTavish and Mackenzie continued to bicker . Rum and high wines , powder and shot and vermilion , were unloaded at the company 's wharves at St. Mary 's and at the Grand Portage , and the Montreal canoes. returned loaded to the gunwales with pelts  --  smooth beaver , tawny moosehides , marten and mink and muskrat and an occasional fisher , buffalo skins from the Red River and the Pembina . A gun , if sold to an Indian , cost as many beaver skins as might be laid flat one on top of the other and pounded down till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns in those days had not short barrels . The company was employing , in ' 98 , fifty clerks , seventyone interpreters , one thousand one hundred and twenty voyageurs , and thirty-five guides , and its capital had increased to at least eleven times that of the original  | coalition . In ' 99 , at the Grand Portage rendezvous , Alexander Mackenzie announced his intention of withdrawing from the company . In November , having returned to Montreal , he carried out his threat , and sailed for England . The Woman of the Glade had a new name . She was no longer called Ozhah-guscoday-wayquay , but Neengay , My Mother , and she was content . Even Johnston had adopted the name . A little more round in body , but still young , still beautiful , she moved between the Johnston house and the Indian village , increasingly important in both . In 1800 Jane was born , a little creature with dark eyes and a haze of black silk over her little round skull . Lewis , who was seven , and George , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother than like their father , stood about her , watching her with the careful gentleness of extreme curiosity , the romantic tenderness which very little children often show for children smaller still . She was born in January . In spring , in the garden behind the house , lilacs were in bloom on the low bushes ; marigold and sweet William and mint in square beds and round ones ; daisies in the long grass at the garden 's edge ; currant bushes in a row ; sweetbriar , transplanted from the woods . Johnston 's voyageurs had brought Neengay the seeds , the roots , the cuttings for her garden , from old gardens at Mackinac and from Detroit . Before the house , sheep were cropping the grass down to the water 's edge , leaving clumps of wild iris and buttercups untouched . The beach was sandy , and a narrow dock ran out toward the deeper water in order that the larger bateaux might have less difficulty in unloading . The warehouses were larger now , there was a fur press , a wine cellar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned to make butter , beating it in an upright churn , and pressing it into stone crocks to be placed in the spring house , but she had not learned to eat it .  | She did not dislike it ; she simply forgot to use it except in preparing food for her husband . A carpenter 's shop had been added to the blacksmith shop built when Lewis was two years old , and bunk houses had been erected for the men who were constantly arriving and leaving , so that the Johnston property alone had the air of a little village , or more rightly , that of a feudal estate . Mr. Cadotte still lived to the west of them , but he was old and went about very little . Michel left that year to establish a permanent trading post at Chegoimegon , and although he was to be in every way an independent trader , his friendship for Johnston assured them of the Chegoimegon furs . Indeed , by this time Johnston exercised what amounted to a monopoly of trade along the southern shore of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army of voyageurs and commis , found himself much in the position of a Scottish border chief . During the next fourteen or fifteen years he handled annual capital amounting to forty thousand dollars , and being of an extravagant disposition , he enjoyed spending somewhat lavishly on his house and furnishings . He brought in books and pictures , fine china , fine wines , some beautiful old silver plate which he had engraved with a crest of his own devising  --  a crane , totem of the home band of St. Mary 's , several elk heads , and the motto Vive ut Postea Vivas . He had his portrait painted , and in a broad gold frame it hung above the wooden mantel of the fireplace , shedding the luster of the red coat , the white ruffled shirt , the gold frame , upon the large , low-ceilinged room . More and more the interior of the house took on the aspect of an affluent country house in Ireland , a great fascination to French and Indian alike , and more and more Neengay found herself involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the gentlemen of the Northwest , and for other distinguished visitors , there was the lavish hospitality of the living-room , and for the Indians and the men whom  | Johnston called mes gens , the broad hearth in the kitchen and Neengay , ready in case of illness with homely remedies  --  opodeldoc , friar 's balsam , salts , opium , castor oil , bitter herb stews , mallow for the kidneys , bonewort for a fever , juniper berries for calculus , balsam twigs for a rheum , poultice of red willow or of chokecherry bark to stanch the flow of blood . In 1800 also a United States Customs official visited Grand Portage , informing the Northwest that he meant to collect duty on every bale of goods and on every bale of furs unloaded there , and the Northwest began to make its arrangements to remove to the mouth of the Kamanistiquia , afterward called Fort William , in honor of William McGillivray . In 1802 Sir Alexander Mackenzie returned from London , where he had got the account of his discoveries published and himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northwest Company , and trouble began to be felt at once through all the fur-trading country . The New Northwest Company , sometimes known as the Alexander Mackenzie Company , but more commonly as the XY Company , was small , and composed of those few men who had seceded from the old Northwest with Mackenzie . It gave the Northwest a rival which knew all the ins and outs of the trade , and which seemed imbued to a man with the furious tenacity and energy of Sir Alexander himself . Prices of goods to the Indians dropped in both companies in desperate efforts to undersell each other ; salaries of commis and voyageurs went up . More than twice as much liquor was sold as in ordinary times , and fights among Indians , and between traders and Indians , and between trader and trader , increased proportionately . Some of the Northwest traders , having made their bargains and dispensed their rum , made a point of suddenly moving on a day 's journey in order to avoid the effects of their gift . One trader , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempted to quiet him with a dose of laudanum . The dose proved to be an overdose ; the Indian died , and there was trouble with his band , who held that he had been murdered . At Lac du Flambeau a commis by the name of Francois Victor Malhiot conferred with his Indian customers as to the prices paid for furs by his XY rival , " old Chorette , " and exclaimed in despair , " One would think that the goods cost him nothing or that Lucifer brought them to him through the air . " And Alexander Henry the Younger , the nephew of Alexander Henry of Mackinac , stationed on the plains of the Pembina , did not hesitate to waylay and use force upon a band of Indians , mostly women , who were taking their furs to pay a credit to the XY trader for that district . Johnston , whose popularity with the Indians had never depended upon a lavish use of rum , thanked heaven he was an independent , and his trade went on much as usual . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly departed this life ; the Northwest Company immediately sought a reconciliation with Mackenzie , and , as the news went north and west from post to post , a gradual sigh of relief rose from the harassed commis and wintering partners . So went the opening years of the nineteenth century . In spite of a mysterious plague which had attacked the beavers in 1804 , the animal wealth of the country was still fabulous . Alexander Henry , riding over the plains of the Pembina , saw great herds of buffalo and killed two for sport , taking from the carcasses only the tongues . In a small wood the trees were rubbed bare of bark and the ground was thick with dung as in a cattle yard . In the early spring , the ice in the Pembina River breaking suddenly overnight , vast numbers of buffalo which had been sleeping on the ice  --  the ice and the plain indistinguishable under the snow  --  fell into the  | river and were drowned . Day after day their bodies floated down past Henry 's camp , or were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as the weather increased in warmth they rotted , the stench making the shores of the river uninhabitable . The wilderness was rich also in berries , in wild grapes , little sweet apples , and the Pembina was named for the " summer berry , " the small round Indian plum . It was a treasure house laid open to looting . Alexander Henry the Elder to John Askin : Montreal 8th May 1799 . . .

My family all join in praying for the Happiness of yours and remain your affectionately ALEXANDER HENRY Rum is selling five sh . Spirrits high , proof Mr. Sharp died yesterday of an inflammation of the Bowells , which shall be a great loss to Leath . XI EIGHTEEN EIGHT , early September . The rain was falling , a mild autumnal rain , dotting the water with circles that spread and interlaced . A few leaves , yellowed and speckled with brown or bright green , showed among the hazel thickets , and in the balsam woods the fine branches held the water like so many brushes , to be released at the slightest jar . Jane sat on the bed beside the visitor , regarding the blond young girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane eight years old in a little calico frock with long skirt and very high waist , with leggins and moccasins , and about her shoulders a sort of knitted spencer with long sleeves and a high collar . Her right hand , lying in her lap , was closed upon some treasure ; the room was full of shadow from the rainy day , although it was mid-morning . The visitor ,  | " the little Miss Campbell , " who was only a few years older than Jane , had been unpacking her belongings . The older of the Johnston children , Lewis , George , and Jane , had been warned not to speak to her of her father , who had been killed only a few weeks before in a duel , and it was for this reason that Jane had been following her about with a silent childish compassion that would , for an older person , have been quite as distressing as floods of tears and protestations of sympathy . John Campbell had been a trader on the upper Mississippi since 1792 . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nineteenth century , where he had held the office of justice of the peace for that part of the Indian territory , and had performed marriages for the reasonable fee of one hundred pounds of flour per marriage . He was well known at Mackinac and at St. Joseph 's , where he had sometimes stopped on his way to Montreal , and it was at Mackinac in a drinking bout that he became involved in the quarrel that was the cause of his death . Duels were common enough in those days , almost as common among gentlemen as brawls among half-breeds . Even Johnston , for all his peace-loving disposition , had fought his duel , standing , with a pistol that was as likely not to fire as to fire , before an equally uncertain pistol , had felt , before he had succeeded in firing his own weapon , his brow grazed by something hot and brief , and , upon realizing what had occurred , had fired into the air . He had lost a lock of hair from his temple and although he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home as a scalp lock to Neengay , he did not see it again . Poor Campbell 's affair had no such fortunate ending . He and his challenger , Red Crawford , met first at Mackinac , but , their friends having informed the justice of the peace of their intentions , the proceeding had been interrupted . No longer drunk , still obstinate in their quarrel , Campbell and Crawford had arranged to meet later near Point  | Detour , and it was there that Campbell received his mortal wound . A dying man was ferried across the river to Point Fort St. Joseph , and two days later a downward-bound bateau conveyed his body to Mackinac . He had been well liked in the territory where he was best known , so much so that John Askin , writing to his father of the affair , ended his letter : " As its probable that Mr. Crawford and Dickson the second will return to the country where this man 's family resides , I 'm approhensive that they will meet with a great deal of difficulty &; its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take in that country . " He continued , " You 'll receive one Mocouts Sugar , a Bundle of Mats &; a Mocout of dried Huckleberrys which you 'll please accept of . " So John Campbell was buried and his little traveling companion became a visitor in John Johnston 's house . " Look ! " said Jane , unfolding her hand . " It 's my father 's watch . " The other child bent her head above it and smiled with pleasure , for Jane had opened the gold hunting-case to a design cut fancifully from white tissue paper , already pale ivory with age , a design of cupids and hearts and flowers . " It 's from Ireland , " said Jane , " he brought it in his pocket when he came . And do you know , every time he crosses the bay at L'Anse Kewenaw it runs down all at once ! So he never takes it in his pocket any more when he is going there . Some day I am going to Ireland , and I shall learn to cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , then . " The dark head and the fair leaned close together , and the rain beat softly on the window panes . XII THE curiosity of Andriani regarding the shape of the earth was but one of the many curiosities of the time  | regarding the physical universe . As if the cosmos were a delightful and ingenious arrangement , waiting there to be investigated by the mind of man , and all unsuspecting that such investigation might lead them , for a time at least , into terror and confusion , secure in an established background of Divinity , Johnston , along with Andriani and Kalm and Linnaeus , began to poke and pry and wonder about tangible things . Priestley had come , the year after the building of the Johnston house at St. Mary 's , to America , a refugee from British intolerance . News that the air was one fifth oxygen trickled northward to the Sault , and took its place in the imagination beside the idea that the earth is flattened at the poles . Indians came to the house with bits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manidos in copper , of an island in Lake Superior littered with pieces of pure copper , an island forbidden to campers . Indians who had camped there but one night and come away the following morning were seized with illness before their canoe touched the mainland , and died , all but one . He heard also of a boulder of pure copper lying in the River Ontonagon , and deeply revered . Because he placed the specimens brought him in a special cabinet with the cured wings of strange birds , dried flowers , seeds of strange plants , as if in a shrine , and because he listened seriously to their stories , the Indians brought him other pieces of the spiritual metal , and also reddishbrown lumps of iron ore , heavy , cold gray lumps of hematite , chunks of snowy quartz veined finely with gold , like a pattern of lightning . He conferred with Jean Baptiste about the story of the forbidden island , and Jean Baptiste had also a legend , an inherited Jesuit explanation . The Indians , said the old Canadian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his face colored by Ojibway blood and Ojibway habits of living , yet speaking from his paternal culture , the Indians , he said , when they are preparing food , frequently  | heat stones which they drop into the kettles containing the food . Especially in the old days did they do so before kettles of iron or copper were much used , and when most of the cooking was done in birchbark vessels . Camping upon the forbidden island , he said , they had doubtless picked up lumps of copper sulphide , which , being boiled with their food , had poisoned them . Why the Indians considered copper more manido than iron is hard to say , unless the color had something to do with it , but the fact remains that they were right , for although iron has perhaps been the more powerful of the two in its influence over human life , copper , the electrical affinity , is certainly the more magical substance . On business expeditions along the southern shore and into the wooded mountains by river routes , and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his notebooks . He stuffed owls ; he took reckonings with the sun compass , labeled and numbered minerals , and sent for books on the new philosophies . There were also a few fossils , gray stone worms , and shells from Garden River , and the petrified skull found at St. Joseph 's Island , of which he wrote , " This last was almost perfect ; the eyes , ears and part of the nose and mouth were quite discernible , the interior of the mouth and cavity of the skull seemed a perfect crystal ; the last could easily be distinguished through the sockets of the eyes . " 0 man , to crystal grown ! For one whose temperament combined so deep a moral strain with such a love of the fantastic and extraordinary , what a memento mori ! In that crystalline air beside that lively water , all the air about him fragrant and nimble and balsamic , he held this curious object , which may have been no more than a remarkable geode , in his hands , and read its message , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less powerful and true . There was the report , also , brought by an Indian , of the footprint of Manabozho in the solid rock on the north side of  | St. Joseph 's Island . And there was always in the back of his mind the story told by Waub-ojeeg that last autumn of his life about the gold ingot in the Porcupine Mountains . In 1809 , September 2i , at the request of Roderick McKenzie , who , in Montreal , was beginning to collect documents relative to the early days of the Northwest Company , he wrote An Account of Lake Superior . He got out the journals which he had carefully kept those first years , and , in the serenity of the big , empty livingroom , his women busy in the kitchen , his storehouses , his fur press , his wine cellar , his blacksmith shop all prosperous and sturdy , ranged to the right and left of his dwelling , his garden flourishing , his men busy about his errands , he gave his first conscious look backward to those windy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ile St. Michel , now shortened to Ile Michel for Michel Cadotte , to Andriani , to the stained ax handle . Of the Sault he wrote in a fine legible hand : " The situation of the village is pleasing and romantic . The ground rises gently from the edge of the river . " He wrote that the houses were scattered over a slight ridge , four hundred yards from the river ; that there was a great deal of sweet clover ; that the soil was a light mold mixed with sand , twelve to eighteen inches deep over a bed of cold clay ; that the whitefish season was from May to November ; that the largest fish caught in the past season weighed fifteen pounds . He wrote that the rapids were one mile wide and half a mile long , descending over a bed of red freestone interspersed with white rocks , and that the Northwest Company had a fine sawmill on the north side . He wrote , " The southwest channel of the rapids takes its course S.W. for five leagues to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore covered with maple and is one continued meadow of the richest soil I ever saw . " He mentioned the Northwest  | Company 's shipyard at Point aux Pins , reported the finding of pure silver ore at Point Iroquois , of cinnabar at Vermilion Point , compared Gros Cap and Point Iroquois to the Pillars of Hercules , and called for a poet to immortalize them . He then proceeded , with many moral and geological reflections , to a minute description of the southern shore , cove by cove , indentation by rocky indentation , exactly as it was revealed to him in all its beauty and danger on that slow , shore-tracing journey . It was a record for a voyageur , with warnings about winds , currents , reefs , good and bad camping places . He had a theory that the water of Lake Superior was exceedingly pure and light , giving for its support the fact that it ruffles very easily . He said , " At the Falls I have often seen the water rise from two to three feet in as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Of the rivers which enter Superior from the south he said only one , the Ontonagon , was not black , " as if their source were turf bogs , " and ascribed this color to the presence of iron ore . He was charmed with his subject . As he wrote , the landscape grew before him brightly ; the fatigue , the mosquitoes , the muscles cramped from long hours in the canoe , melted , faded , became as nothing , and his pen grew agile . Having passed Les Grands Sables , he came to the Portails , white freestone harbors , " placed by Providence for safety on a hazardous coast . I once passed here in the month of May , immediately after a gale of wind which continued for four days , with severe frost and snow from the north . The effect on the fall was beautiful . It was frozen up entirely except a little gutter in the middle , not more than a foot wide . The sides resembled pillars variously fluted ; the shrubs at the mouth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Corinthiah capitals . A young pine about thirty feet high which grew in the middle of its bed , and sparkling like a  | conical pillar of crystal sculptured in fretwork , crowned the brilliant perspective . " He came next to the Pictured Rocks , of which he wrote : " The several strata from which exude different mineral waters , tainting the smooth white freestone with innumerable grotesque figures in a variety of drapery , are easily distinguished . . . the summit of the precipices crowned with lofty maples , every shelf and vein filled with shrubs and evergreens , sometimes in festoons , and at others spreading like hanging gardens . " At Miner 's Bay , where in 1772 the Duke of Richmond had established a small camp to look for silver and copper , he found excellent grindstones ready made on the beaches , and at Grand Island , beholding the great bay with its green even slopes , he thought of Milton 's " shade above shade , a woody theatre . " The Indians came there on calm nights to spear whitefish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he explored for copper , and noted that the mineral-bearing rocks never had anything growing on them , while others , not so high and equally devoid of soil , were thickly covered with stunted pines . But on those metallic rocks he found one spring a quantity of seagulls ' eggs , " which , when fried in the pan with some pork , made an excellent supper with a dish of aromatic tea . " Still traveling west , he found in Potter 's Bay a part of an Indian bowl made of clay and very old , and off Potter 's Head he observed a little island , " apparently round and pretty high , " on which he never set foot , but which , however , charmed him infinitely . " When I made my first voyage in the Lake . " he wrote , " I tarried opposite Contemplation Island , as I called it , for four days , and I recollect having filled ten or twelve pages of my journal with reflections , remarks , and some poetical effusions , the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote of this little island , which had the privilege of filling his mind " with a pleasing melancholy and a desire for quiet sequestration , where every worldly care and  | every mean passion should be lulled to rest , and the heart left at full liberty to examine itself , develop each complicated fold , wash out each stain with a repentant tear , and , finally , become worthy of holding converse with nature , approach the Celestial Portals , and , though at an infinite distance , be permitted a glimpse of its Almighty Sovereign , but our Father and God . " He was still east of Keewaynan ( Kewenaw ) , the " way made straight by means of a portage . " But when he had described the bay , the portage , the Indian village on the cliffs above the portage lake , he remembered an evening in May some years later , an evening in 1803 , and wrote : " The sun was nearly settled and just gilded the skirts of the Keewaynan Mountains with its horizontal rays , tipping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridge with burnished gold . I made my men rest for a few minutes on their oars . . . . As the rays of the sun became fainter , I saw the trees on the skirts of the mountains , even to the extremity of the point , all in apparent motion and manoeuvering like an army attempting to gain a position . Soon after , the mountains began to rise , each retaining its proper form , the valleys , though high in the air , still kept their humble distance from the hills ; among the real trees a few scattered rays of the immerging sun were still perceptible . At length the majestic edifice gradually descended , and to the air-built fabric succeeded a general blush which tinged the whole horizon . " This remembered radiance lingered in his mind as he went on conscientiously with his detailed report , on past the stiff red clay of the Ontonagon , the sand hills and cherry shrubs of the Bay St. Charles , the beech and maple forest of Ile Michel . He told the story of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an account and criticism of the site of the new British fort on St. Joseph 's Island , which seemed to him hardly well chosen from any point of view , a " desolate landscape , although the seat of honor , justice , politeness and the most liberal  | hospitality . " Then to record the temperature of St. Mary 's , in winter shifting from forty below to zero in a few hours , in summer varying from ninety to fortyfive in the same day , but on the whole an excellent climate , a healthy place , " where nothing shortens life but intemperance . " And so to sand his paper , and fold it , and after dinner to take it across the river , where he delivered it into the hands of the Montreal Express of the Northwest Company .  | PART TWO THE winter of 1810 was long and very bitter . At the Sault the gayety of the French and the good liquor of the Northwest Company lightened the days and it seemed not unlike other winters . At Fort St. Joseph , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal hospitality , " visitors were few and the sight that greeted the eyes of the Irish and English soldiers quartered there was always the same , the river , solid ice under drifted snow , spreading away into the beginning of Lake Huron , the dark tufted lines here and there in the whiteness that were the shapes of Point Detour , Harbor Island , Ile a la Crosse . In April , that sweet season , when English thickets were beginning to grow wick , the Commander of the garrison set himself down to compose a letter to his superior officer concerning a conspiracy to desert brought on among his men by the extreme cold and monotony of the place . Two of the men only had attempted an actual escape . One morning early in March , without proper provisions or equipment , in spite of the terrific cold , they had struck out across the ice for Mackinac . Their departure was observed but not reported until late that afternoon . The first party sent after them had to turn back at nightfall because of the weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserters was found , frozen and deep in snow , at Goose Island . A little farther on , that of his comrade , still living , was found and taken back to St. Joe , but the hands and feet were frozen and later it became necessary to amputate both legs and the fingers of both hands . These two examples , the one living , the other dead , were sufficient to check the conspiracy without further action on the part  | of the commander , and the garrison waited on , minute and isolated , for the spring . II IT was July , 1812 . In the garden behind the house the lilacs had ceased to bloom , but the sweet william and pinks were unfolding a warm sweetness upon the air . A little girl with a delicate brown skin , dark eyes , and black hair , Eliza , then ten years old , leaned over the sweet william to observe the velvety colors , maroon , purple , white and purple , and a dark-haired , darkskinned woman with a hawk nose and gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman in a costume of blue cotton cloth , with a three-cornered red shawl folded over her bosom , but wearing quilled moccasins and scarlet leggins , and in her ears loops of silver , each bearing two long silver bobs . The day was immensely fair , immensely tranquil . Between the leaves and grasses and in the woods beyond the Indian green were intervals of coolness and shadow , but the day itself , arching over the river and the meadows and the far hills , was transparently and vitally hot . The river was cold and unruffled . Sunlight , descending into the green water , illumined it , but never warmed it . And across the cold , still water a canoe came floating , darting , pausing , darting again , and beached its prow near the Johnston dock . Johnston was in the long living-room at a table full of papers . He glanced up casually to observe the messenger , but sprang to his feet when he had heard the news , called for a bottle of the best sherry , and drank the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from Fort St. Joseph that England and the United States were at war , and the plan was to attack Mackinac at once and regain it for Britain . The Northwest Company was arming to a man , the Indians were glad of an opportunity  | to fight ; would Johnston and his people be at Fort St. Joseph not later than the afternoon of the fifteenth , and would he observe lest news of the war and the attack reach the ears of some one who might convey it to Mackinac ? The early morning of the fifteenth found everything prepared and in motion . Since it was summer , most of Johnston 's men were at St. Mary 's , as was also the greater part of the Saulteur band . The traders in bateaux , the Indians in their long canoes , the whole little fleet , according to report comprising some two hundred men , moved out around the head of Sugar Island into Lake George , and so south . The water was quiet , as on the day before . From the oars of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interlinking circles , and each boat and canoe was accompanied by its colored reflection . The mouth of Echo River lay hidden in its reed bed ; they crossed the shallows in the upper part of the lake where the floating heads of pickerel weed broke the fine glaze of water , and passed , at the foot of the lake , a small island with a single beautiful young elm . The channel narrowed between Sugar and the rocky coast of the mainland on the east , the current becoming very powerful , and they made good time down into Bear Lake . They passed small islands of polished silica , each with a high hump or ridge of rock , breaking off suddenly into stony harbors with deep water or running down in sandy , verdure-covered points , each island the color of a walnut shell , the rock , at the water line , banded with vermilion where the iron had seeped through in rust . The ruddy band , the tawny rock , the little fantastic tufts of pine in the clefts of the rock , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the perception was mocked with a multiplicity of islands . Blueberries , just beginning to sweeten , grew in the seams of the rock , and lady'sslippers , now fading , in the swampy hollows of the  | points . On the right , Sugar Island was still and rich with maple leaves and sandy beaches . A slight wind , flawing the water in Bear Lake , indicated the division between Sugar and Big Neebish Island , as the covey of boats rounded the northern end of St. Joseph 's and continued south between it and the Neebish . All wooded , all calm ; the maples of Sugar giving way to conifers , particularly the plumed white pine . The steady line of Neebish and Little Neebish , or Encampment Island , ran out southward into reedy points , as if the river had drawn the green downstream with it , frayed out , like silk , from its proper substance . The river , known as St. Mary 's , widened into Muddy Lake , of which the farther shore , the Michigan mainland , lay low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lake by a band of silver , a band of atmosphere , an actual apparition , a looming . Past Hay Point they went , past Round Island and Lime , called then , after the game which the Indians played there , Ile a la Crosse . They went between Lime and St. Joe , whose low shores rose gradually through acre upon acre of hardwoods to the mountain which gave the island its Ojibway name . It stood , a symmetrical gentle form , covered with leaves and blue haze , not very high , but , with an air of permanence befitting a member of the oldest range on earth . At noon , the sun beating down on them and upward from the glassy water , the voyageurs and Indians lifted their gaze to this form so blue , so cool . About three in the afternoon they saw on their left the white limestone chimneys and walls of Fort St. Joseph , and dropping below the Point , came to haven on the eastern side of it in a weedy , sandy bay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bateaux of the Northwest , and with the usual vessels of the fort . The square dock was no longer accessible ; the shore , beyond the ranks of the alders , was alive with men . Johnston climbed the hill through grass where the three bright  | leaves of the poison ivy , just beginning to root itself on that slope , looked freshly sinister , and found Askin and the Commander of the regulars consulting in one of the whitewashed houses of the fort . Every one was very hopeful , very gay . Although the American occupation of the Sault had been a purely nominal affair , with no troops and no garrison , and practically no American settlers , the matter of licenses and customs was something of a hindrance and an irritation , the Non-Importation Act and the Embargo had every one by the ears , and at Mackinac the high customs exacted was causing a good deal of embarrassment to the trade . Every one was anxious to return to the old regime . The Indians , tired of being handed from nation to nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transferring their affections from the French to the English , were unwilling to transfer them again to the Americans , and there is not much to indicate that the Americans had ever done anything to make this transfer easy . As for the British , they had built the fort at Mackinac , it was theirs , and although they hardly expected England to regain the colonies en masse , they had been suffering a nostalgia for the last sixteen years , and felt it would be pleasant to move back into their own possessions . Therefore the toasts went round , and Mistress Madeleine Askin spread a holiday supper for the officers and unenlisted leaders . The chief business of the preparation was in distributing arms and ammunition to the Canadians and Indians . There were Ottawas and Ojibways from the lower part of the river and the Michigan side of the Straits of Mackinac , a company to the number of two hundred and eighty under John Askin . The two hundred and sixty Canadians were under Toussaint Pothiers , Le Beau Pothiers ; the forty British regulars in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparations went forward , musket  | rods rattling in guns , flintlocks being tested , powderhorns filled , the artillery of the occasion being mounted in the flat-bottomed bateaux ; and below the fort the Indians by their fire were painting and attiring themselves for the ceremonial dance . They left St. Joe at ten o'clock the morning of the sixteenth , and an hour before daybreak on the seventeenth they landed on the northern side of Mackinac Island , in a shallow hay now called British Landing . Their fleet , according to Askin , consisted of fifty canoes , each carrying ten warriors , and ten barges or bateaux ; their artillery of two iron six-pounders , and they carried also scaling ladders . Johnston , in the center , was one of the first to land . The air was filled with the pure and vague luminance of very early day ; the depths of the water were unusually visible . Standing in the prow of his boat , well muffled in his capot against the chill fresh air , he looked down into the water and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their approach . They landed quietly , boat after boat sliding up with a soft crush of prow upon sand , and disembarked as quietly . Askin formed his Ojibways on the left , the Canadians and regulars held the center , and about one hundred western Indians , Sioux , Folles Avoines and Winnebagos , under red-headed Colonel Dixon , had the right . The artillery was " dragged with Velosity " through dry underbrush , cedar swamp , and thicket , and planted on the rising ground to the northeast of the unsuspecting fort . The Indians , no longer in ceremonial regalia , but stripped of everything but paint and weapons , were like hounds in leash . As the heterogeneous army advanced , interpreters , both Canadian and Indian , crept back and forth from wing to wing , repeating instructions to the Indians not to attack before ordered . The morning advanced with light and heat . At ten o'clock , such had been the " Velosity " of the artillery , all was ready for the attack , and a flag  | of truce was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hanks received the delegation with some surprise , since he had not heard there was a war afoot . When he learned of the disposition of the army in the surrounding woods , and heard the whooping , directly under the pickets , of a few uncontrollable Indians , he very reasonably surrendered . The white flag was hoisted in place of the flag with the red and white stripes and the wreath of white stars on blue , and this was followed shortly by the British cross . The Indians , British , and French Canadians trooped into the fort , shook hands with their defeated enemies , admired the beauty of the grounds , the spaciousness of the barracks , and in general made themselves at home . Some men were sent to take over two small schooners lying at anchor in the harbor , some to prepare breakfast , and Mackinac was again British . Not a gun had been fired , not even an old hen killed . Johnston , Askin , and the other traders found their chief employment for the rest of the day in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a peaceful victory , " committed no improper acts . " It had been twenty years since Johnston sat with Lieutenant Charleton in the officer 's headquarters while Doyle made out the paper for his grant . Since then the grant had become worthless according to the American law , although no one had tried to dispossess him . Now , perhaps , it was to be made secure again under the Crown . He was too busy today for contemplation , and he had also been many times since to Mackinac , but the vision of that day of a beginning must have followed him , beyond the movement of the naked painted figures with feathers in their loose black hair , of the loungers in fringed buckskin shirts and knitted caps , of the women , appearing an instant in a doorway , and disappearing to scurry about some household readjustment , beyond the voices and the sound of feet . Some days after the victory , a party of Nor'westers  | arrived from Fort William . They had stopped at Fort St. Joe with the intention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than half deserted , and hearing the good news , had come on to the island , partly to join in the jubilations and partly to verify the astonishing tale . They stayed only a few days , and then returned to Superior . Johnston went back to St. Mary 's . The English fell into their old ways about the fort , and Astor and certain gentlemen formerly of the Northwest were left to straighten out their business as best they could . The war went on , with little change for St. Mary 's except that most people considered themselves British subjects once more and were pleased . Lewis Johnston , who was nineteen , insisted on joining the King 's Navy . George would have liked to go with him , but his father persuaded the younger boy that he was needed at the Sault . Johnston 's frequent and irregular absences on trading expeditions left the sixteen-year-old the head of the house , and the boy matured early in matters of responsibility . In 1813 , September 1o , at the Battle of Put-In Bay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great tales to tell . His ship had been the Queen Charlotte , which the Americans took . There had been fire and carnage and spectacular heroism , but what seemed to have impressed him most was the funeral on the south shore after the battle , when the British and American officers were interred side by side , to the same music , the same solemn words , with common mourning . The Northwest Company and the independent British traders continued to convey supplies to the British troops whenever there was need . The schooner Nancy , which had plied the waters of Lake Superior for the XY Company , was requisitioned by the British and made into a transport , and in August , 1814 , was sunk at Natua Sackie to prevent her falling into the hands of the Americans . She had wintered the preceding season  | at St. Mary 's , locked in the ice , shrouded with snow , but still warm at the heart , where her custodians kept a fire in the galley stove . In August , lake water invaded stove and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Northwest merchants should give so much aid to the military . There seemed to be some vague idea among them that wars were between armies , not countries , and they cherished an irritation against the Northwesters out of all proportion to the situation . Meanwhile for month on end everything was so quiet on the St. Mary 's as to warrant Jane 's traveling with her father on one of his mercantile visits to Mackinac . Ever her father 's best companion , the little girl of thirteen who knew his jokes , his favorite quotations , and for all her dark skin had such pretty Irish manners , followed him shyly about the green lawns of the fort , and dined with him at the officers ' mess . She heard there talk of the fur trading , and of skirmishes at Detroit and desultory Indian warfare along the border , and once she saw a strange visitor , an Ojibway woman whose husband had been killed in the war , and who had assumed her husband 's ornaments and weapons and taken his place in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , could not remember another instance of an Indian woman 's going to war . This feminine warrior was small , not nearly so tall as Neengay , and delicate in build . She came into the room on the arm of one of the young lieutenants , smiling and shy , and was introduced to the commanding officer , to Johnston , and to Jane . Her face was not painted , there were no feathers in her smooth hair , she had retained the fringed skirt and leggins of the Ojibway woman , but she wore the silver armlets , the medals , the scalping knife , the medicine pouch , of her husband , all the insignia of war , even to the tomahawk . The officers led her to a large mirror , and their amusement was no greater than her evident pleasure as she turned herself around and around before the bright surface ,  | laughing aloud in her delight . She was invited to dine with the officers , and although obviously unused to sitting at a table or eating with a fork , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifts followed the meal , and the officers conducted her back to her lodge with due honor and respect . Jane and her father , leaning on the breastworks , watched the small procession wind down the steep hillside , the Ojibway woman alert and gay , smiling up at the young lieutenant who escorted her , an infantryman following , his arms piled high with cherry-red four-point woolen blankets . The year 1813 turned slowly into the year 1814 . Late in July the Americans decided to regain Mackinac , if possible , and a small fleet of seven vessels under Captain Arthur Sinclair and Colonel Croghan appeared in Lake Huron and stood to anchor opposite the island . They carried seven hundred men and should have been able to take the place , but their intentions seemed obscure and hesitant . The British , observing them from the whitewashed breastworks of the fort , and from the square projecting tower of the blockhouse , were able to proceed leisurely about preparations for a defense . A prize which interested the Americans quite as much , however , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , due to pass at any time now from Fort William , down the St. Mary 's , and across the upper part of Lake Huron to the mouth of the French River , a caravan of canoes loaded to the limit with beaver and muskrat furs , skins of wild swans , bearskins , moosehides , every kind of peltry , and valued at no less than a million dollars . They wished to capture this flotilla far more than they did the fort , and in view of what they considered injuries from the Northwest Company , together with the liberties of war , they considered it legitimate prey . They dreaded being involved in an attack on the fort at the moment when this rich booty might be passing . So they manifested  | great indecision in their movements , and on the morning of the third the British were surprised to see the greater part of the fleet weigh anchor and disappear into the blue distance of the Grand Detour . The Americans proceeded under a fair wind past Drummond and , veering to the left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute green comrades , to Fort St. Joe on its stony rounded point , like an inverted bowl . Here they landed , and finding the defenders few , since the British were holding two forts on Mackinac Island , took possession of the schooner Mink , the property of the Northwest Company , which was in harbor there laden with two hundred and thirty-nine barrels of flour for St. Mary 's , and burned the fort and storehouses . The wind dropping a little , the flames went up from the top of the low green dome in a nearly perpendicular roar ; the American vessels and the Mink , standing out in midchannel for safety , felt the heat shake against their canvas . Then it was all over , except a black smoke and an occasional crashing timber . The great stone chimneys and fireplaces remained , blackened and gaunt and isolated . News of this reached the Sault very promptly . Neengay saw the canoes of the Northwest moving off downstream shortly after noon . By early twilight Johnston was ready to leave . George was with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him practically every ablebodied man from his own employment , but the body of his troops was Indian . Tradition says there were a thousand warriors . He had waited for them to prepare according to their own customs . All afternoon the air and water had throbbed to the beat of their drums until the summer landscape had taken on a tremor of excitement , seeming to retain actually the accumulation of the single powerful beat . Now the heat of the day was gone , and the wind , which had ruffled the straits all day , had as usual fallen away to nothing . The leader 's canoe floated  | on the still water , and by ones and twos and threes the Indian canoes pushed off from the sandy bank and joined it , forming in order to the rear . All the women of the Indian camp had followed the warriors to the beach . Neengay , with the two little children close beside her and the four-months-old baby in her arms , stood on the grassy slope in front of the house . A little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the little Miss Campbell were seated on the grass . As the last canoe floated free of the beach , Johnston lifted his arm , a signal followed by the lifting of the paddles of all the Canadians , who at once broke into a song . The paddles descended as one , broke the water , and the fleet moved off , skimming . They took the passage through Hay Lake and down the West Neebish Rapids , the more difficult route , but one which the Americans would be unlikely to be observing . Neengay returned to the house and began to prepare supper for Will and Charlotte and Jane . The room was shadowy , being at the east end of the building , and large . An Indian woman who helped her with the work , for there was much to do around the place , was there on her knees arranging curls of birchbark and pieces of split cedar between the irons in the big fireplace . The children drew near to her , waiting for the flame to light the room , for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , setting out corncake and blueberries and a jug of milk . She moved in a feeling of security and content . She had grown used to living in a house . The walls about her seemed permanent , a part of the natural scene , like the slope of the ground outside , and the slow indentation of the shoreline . She could not easily remember when they had not been there , as she could not easily remember herself without the children whose soft breathing and little smothered laughter in the corner by the fire mingled with the noise of the fire , an indoor murmur opposed to the murmur of the evening  | outside . The earth and the forest seemed to be sighing deeply and gently as they relaxed for the night , turning to sleep . The cows and horses shifted in their stalls in the barn to the east of the garden . She put the children to sleep in the west bedroom , returning to the kitchen through the large living-room , all quiet , all deserted , but deserted so recently that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . Johnston 's quill pen and his papers lay on the table and he himself looked amiably down upon them from the portrait in the heavy gold frame , the painting indistinct in the half light . She went out to the barns , followed by the Indian woman , to do the chores of the men who had gone down the river , and together they filled the mangers with hay and , in the darkness , milked the cows and brought the full pails into the kitchen . They strained the milk into stone crocks , and the Indian woman took them out one by one to the swinging shelves in the milk house while Neengay began to make bread . She opened the top of a sack of flour and , making a hollow in the flour , poured in a little water , mixing her loaf thus , letting the moisture take up what thickening it needed . She shaped the dough with her hands into a round flat cake , and set it on an iron skillet tipped upright , facing the fire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second loaf when she heard the Indian woman calling to her , and although she did not make out the words , a note of excitement in the old voice brought her to the door , from which she saw a small pinkish glow in the sky above the Canadian hills . The glow deepened , broadened , and presently its earthly source made itself seen in violent gold close to the shore . " They are burning the stores of the Northwest people , " said the woman . The fire spread from building to building along the shore , and a clamor rose above the noise of the rapids . They could make out small black figures running in front of the flames , and finally , above the shouts of the  | men , the noise of the fire itself , crackling electrically and sending the heavy log rafters of the warehouses crashing inward upon their gutted centers . From the Indian encampment a small figure in a shawl ran up to Neengaythe wife of Ahdeek , her youngest brother , a girl hardly older than Jane . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Americans ? " said the Indian woman . " Who else would it be but the Americans ? " said the girl . The crowd of soldiers seemed now to have left the buildings ; they were busy at the mouth of the rapids and they were presently seen and heard to be dragging down into the rapids , with great shouting and exultation , a schooner which had been lying at anchor in Lake Superior near the dock of the Northwest Company . It was in the midst of this uproar that people began running from the Indian camp toward the Johnston home , crying , " They are coming ! " Neengay awoke then to the fact that this spectacle concerned herself , and she turned and ran into the house . A swarm of Indian women followed her . Some one had let the cattle from their stalls and , giving them a smart switching over the rumps , sent them off into the woods . The children were picked up out of their beds and carried off half asleep , half awake . The house was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived the looters were safe in the Indian village , where all the fires were out , all the lodges closed , the dogs tethered and hushed , a village lying still and hardly breathing in the hope that it would not be noticed . This night the Americans were not concerned with the Indians . Some one  --  who , it was never known  --  had informed raiders that a Mr. Johnston , whose warehouses lay unprotected on the American side of the rapids , had gone to the defense of Mackinac with a thousand men , and had offered to guide the marauders to his property . They burned the house . They burned most of the barns  | and all of the warehouses , and seized a great quantity of flour , spirits , and dry goods , which they transported to their fleet . The schooner , which had lodged in a granite ledge halfway down the rapids , they fired as a parting act . By midnight they were gone . Neengay was in the lodge of Wayishkee , which resembled that of her father point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the insignia of the Owl was not present . The children , wrapped in blankets from their own beds , were asleep on the long divan which ran about the wall . The children of Wayishkee were asleep beyond them . Nearest Neengay was the blond head of the little Miss Campbell , who held the baby , Anna Maria , in her arms . Against the farther portion of the couch , Wayishkee 's place , leant the oil portrait of John Johnston , still smiling his faint , good-humored smile . Neengay had salvaged it herself under the impulsion of some half-recognized fear that its identity involved his own , and that he would perish if she let the Americans take it . Behind it , in a pile on the couch , were the various other things which they had managed to save , some silver , some glassware even . The Indians had tried to bring those things which seemed particularly to belong to the Johnston way of living as distinguished from their own . Some that they brought were valuable , some valueless , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After the Americans had left , Neengay lifted the deerskin curtain that hung across the door . She could see the embers of her house , but she did not go then to investigate . She drew over her shoulders a bearskin coverlet and fell asleep . In the night air the fur quivered and lifted as it had done upon its original owner . Through the resumed tranquillity the roar of the rapids came distinctly , unconfused once more .  | III AHDEEK , youngest brother of Neengay , then aged twenty-one , naked except for moccasins and loin cloth , stood astride a half-stripped log of white pine , loosening the bark from it in long fragrant strips . His ax made a slishing noise , gliding between the trunk and the slivers of bark , and with each motion his long black hair , parted in the center and braided in two braids , fell forward from his breast or , as he straightened , dropped back upon it . The bark , rough and gray on the outside , yellow and wet with sap on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it white and shining , showing but faintly the marks of the ax . He was between the river and the charred foundations of the Johnston home , and near him another Ojibway , an older man , was working in similar fashion at another log . Logs were being brought in from the forest , dragged by groups of men through the deep fern and the long meadow grass , and some , cut down river , having been towed upstream , were being landed at the sandy beach , rolled ashore dripping . The heavy morning dew had dried from the garden and from the flaked charcoal of the discarded timbers of the former dwelling , and Johnston 's Canadians had already set in place the first tier of logs above the new floor . The logs had been squared and the ends notched a little on each side so as to leave the core of the wood intact . Some Indian women and some French Ojibways , the wives of the canoemen or descendants of the earliest settlers in the old French village , were mixing mud and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the Indian village , fires were smoking under kettles , women were skinning small game and cleaning whitefish ; all the lodges stood open to the morning , and dogs and children were thick underfoot . Neengay was in the village , superintending the making of a feast , for a house-raising was in progress ; any one who could give a hand with a log was  | invited . At noon and at night they would be banqueted by Johnston and given a regale . It was hardly more than two weeks since the Americans had departed , an interval of eleven days elapsing between the burning of the house and the battle at Fort Mackinac , but destruction had been so complete that reconstruction had of necessity to be swift if autumn was not to find them unprepared . In the morning Johnston would leave for Montreal to arrange for a loan and to make purchases for the winter 's trade . It was already time for many of his men , those bound for the further posts , to be leaving , and there was hardly more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the stormy weather would be upon them . He stood now , in his blue coat and white stock , his hands behind his back , his hair , still long , still yellow although mixed a little with gray , falling across his shoulders , in the garden  --  where the beds , disfigured but not obliterated , and the shrubs , broken but not killed , gave forth an Irish sweetness to the air  --  and directed the work . Three mornings ago , standing in the same place , he had experienced the most complete despair of his existence . Not a building remained untouched save the smithy ; the house and the principal warehouses were completely destroyed . His children were in the wigwams of their mother 's people , and everything that he had tried to establish , some little corner of Irish thought and custom in the Ojibway wilderness , seemed gone forever . This morning , however , after three days of taking stock , a certain arrogance had brought him to reflect that if his fortunes had been high before the disaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise above it , and the sight of his house appearing phoenix-like in the center of all this good-natured confusion gave him great pleasure . It was a restorative . The day was splendid . A little breeze made it pleasant to work in the hot sun , and great masses of white cumulus cloud traveling slowly overhead kept the colors of the hills , the water , and the meadow changing  | and rich . Shortly after noon , one of these clouds , passing low , discharged a brisk shower on the river , the woods , and meadow , as it traveled south and east . They heard it coming on the leaves before it struck them , and when it struck , there was a great scurrying for shelter , like that of a huge Sunday-school picnic . The Indian village received most of the refugees . In Wayishkee 's lodge all of the Johnston family , all of Wayishkee 's family , and Ahdeek and his wife were gathered , laughing , breathless , and wet . Ahdeek , near the door , shook the loosened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turning his face from side to side quickly , with a gesture so like that of Waub-ojeeg that Johnston , seeing him across the distance of the lodge , his imagination sensitive from the events of the last two weeks , thought for a moment it was Waub-ojeeg himself , Waub-ojeeg young , in a world unencumbered by the quarrels of the Northwest Company with the XY , or of the Americans with the British . The rain sang on the bark walls of the lodge , the drops rapid and stinging . The little wife of Ahdeek darted out into the downpour to cover the kettle of sagamite which still swung from the tripod above the fire , and darted in again . The fire sizzled and leaped up more briskly under the rain for a few minutes , and then subsided altogether . Then those near the door saw George , who had not been with them , running out from behind a neighboring lodge , his head down , and something long , wrapped in a piece of blanket , tucked under his arm . He arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , went straight to her . He made her sit down  --  he had something in mind of which he wanted to make a ceremony  --  and made the others stand a little away . Then he laid the long bundle in her lap and waited with his arms folded while she unwrapped it . It was a sword , the sword of an American officer , the sword of Major Arthur Holmes , who had led the marauding expedition and who  | had been killed twelve days later at Mackinac  --  for the attack on Mackinac had been a defeat for the Americans . Today an Indian , learning for the first time the identity of the man who had pillaged his friends , had brought the sword to George Johnston . After all , Neengay was an Ojibway . She closed her hand over the scabbard and a light came into her face . It may have been as well for the Americans in later years that there was at this time some symbol of revenge , not against all Americans , but against the American who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scabbard and , lifting her head , looked at George and nodded . As soon as the rain slackened , the men went back to their work , the women to theirs , and they saw the edge of the storm as it traveled down the river , dotting the water with interrunning circles . By nightfall the framework of the house , including the roof , was completed . An entire house stood there , built of new wood , pale and odorous . The doors and windows were yet to be completed ; the old fireplace had remained . Around the campfires the builders were making merry , and Johnston , on a crest of revived hope and accomplishment , doubled the measure of the regale he had planned to give . Only the face of Eliza , the little girl whose features were more purely Indian than those of any of the children , retained , between the moments when she was actually laughing or speaking , an expression of pain and anger , which strained and drew the child face into a concentration of woe , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days later , the flotilla of the Northwest Company , heavily guarded , came down from Fort William and passed safely through the St. Mary 's , and down behind Manitouline , to the entrance of French River . At the entrance to that river they encamped for the night , having built the packs of furs into a rampart , while men with loaded rifles kept watch until dawn . However , the Americans did not reappear .  | IV THE years went by , 1815 , 1816 , 1817 . The new house began to accumulate such objects as the old one had held , a flat silver fruit dish on a stem , a crystal bowl that , tapped , gave forth a musical note , books , the periodicals of the day , a small rosewood piano from New Haven . Another son was born , John McDougall , October 12 , 1816 . In 1817 Jane was home from Ireland , bringing with her the art of making paper squills , of clipping cupids for watch papers , even as she had planned , of making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of writing verses and setting them to music , of embroidering at a frame , of copying costumes from Bell 's Court and Fashionable Magazine or from La Belle Assemblee . Eliza and Charlotte and the " little Miss Campbell , " now grown to womanhood , but especially Charlotte , hovered about her and were quick to learn these new accomplishments . When their mother was in the room they all spoke Ojibway , and to please her and to please Jane they set Ojibway songs to simple harmonies , dropping the troublesome quarter tones from the melodies ( but not always from their soft , instinctive voices ) , and sang them in a little group about the instrument . Dotted mull and lutestring and fine woolens began to have a place in Johnston 's Montreal orders . There was no weaving and no spinning in this household , but much sewing , fitting , and embroidering . Women 's shoes had not then passed from the province of the dressmaker to that of the cobbler , and although Jane occasionally held out for a pair of cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order of the day , plain , or with flowers and figures worked in colored quills . In 1815 , before the new house was a year old , the first American visitors appeared , General Jacob Brown and his staff , spending the afternoon and evening at the Johnston house , and sitting up all night with rifles  | cocked , ready for a massacre which never came off . In the morning they went back down the river without having visited Lake Superior , the object of their journey . The next year it was General McComb , with the Commander of the revenue cutter from Mackinac , who spent a week with the Johnstons and , going for a picnic survey to Gros Cap , was fired on by a drunken Ojibway . He also retreated down river in the morning . Meanwhile the Northwest and the Hudson 's Bay , or rather , Lord Selkirk , who had bought up one third of the shares of that organization in order to be sure that it would grant him the favors he desired , were at war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Sault knew about it , for Selkirk himself had passed through the village with a regiment of hired soldiers and the intention of taking over Fort William and arresting all available Northwesters . He had tried to persuade Ermantinger , of the British settlement , to go with him as justice of the peace and lend some color of legality to the proceedings , and Ermantinger refusing , whether because of sympathy for the Northwest or because he was really too busy , as he stated , Selkirk constituted himself a justice of the peace , and went on his way . The row had begun as early as 1814 when Miles Macdonell , in command of Selkirk 's Scotch colony on the Red River , ordered that no food should be exported from the colony for a period of twelve months , and seized a quantity of grease and pemmican belonging to the Northwest Company from a fort on the Souris River . The partners of the Northwest , holding first of all the theory that the Hudson 's Bay had no right whatever to grant Lord Selkirk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and sixteen thousand square miles , and some of that in the United States territory into the bargain , and secondly that Macdonell had no right to seize property belonging to the Northwest , held a council at Fort William , and decided that the colony  | must be discouraged , removed  --  in a word , destroyed . They went about it quietly . In 1815 Fort Gibraltar of the Northwest was stormed and taken by Colin Robertson of the Hudson 's Bay , allegedly to regain some cannon belonging to the Hudson 's Bay and stolen by the Northwesters . The year following , the same fort was again seized by the Hudson 's Bay people , torn down , and its timbers employed to strengthen Fort Douglass , a Selkirk stronghold . The Pembina House of the Northwest also yielded to the enemy that year . In June , 1816 , a brush between the two companies occurred of which the origins were still , in 1817 , veiled in darkness , but in the course of which Governor Semple of the Hudson 's Bay Company and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man out of a party of sixty . This was the Battle of Seven Oaks ; or Frog Plains , and was the principal reason for Selkirk 's passing through St. Mary 's with ten canoe loads of Swiss mercenaries , the De Meurons . He succeeded in taking Fort William , which was not expecting the attack of a regiment , and held the partners prisoner for a time , until a justice of the peace from Fort Drummond appeared with a warrant for the arrest of Lord Selkirk himself . He scoffed at the warrant , but lived to repent of having done so , and the De Meurons were disbanded at the far end of Lake Superior , and left to shift for themselves . At this point in the story the Prince Regent sent a message to his subjects in the Canadian wilderness to cease firing , and the message , being couched in formal terms and containing a severe reprimand for all persons concerned , was intrusted to a Montreal barrister to be delivered at Fort William in the summer of 1817 . This same summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ross Cox , a Northwester , arriving not from the East , but from the farthest West , the Pacific Coast . A rotund little man with a John Bull countenance , a dark , cropped head , and an almost inexhaustible  | delight in the resources of rhetoric , he appeared at the Johnston door one August evening in company with the gentlemen of the Northwest House whose guest he was , and one Hector McNeill , his traveling companion . He had gone under the auspices of the Pacific Fur Company , when Astoria still belonged to John Jacob Astor , by way of the Horn to the mouth of the Columbia , and he had been there through the transfer of that far post to the enterprising Nor'westers , who first purchased it and second saw to it that it was captured by Britain in the War of 1812 . After four years of the Nez Perces , the Klatsoops , the Klamaths , he had come overland , changing canoes only at that point where it became necessary to leave the headwaters of the Columbia for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that network of streams and lakes  --  the Saskatchewan , Winnipic , Lac La Pluie  --  leading to Fort William , the Sault , and the beginning of civilization . He was not the first man , by any means , to follow that intricate trail , but neither had it yet become so well established a route ? as it did later  --  that the Northwest Express , leaving Fort George on the Columbia the first of April regularly , was as regularly expected at Fort William on the first of July . It was then still something of an adventure ; Cox himself was a walking geography of the Northwest , a fund of curious and otherwise unobtainable anecdote , whom Johnston received with open arms . A few hours later , Johnston , Cox , and the others left the house , proceeding through grass thick with dew and glowworms to the sandy shore and the canoe of the Northwest Company , and crossed the darkly glossy water , through the magnificent still darkness , to the Northwest House . Here they built up a fire , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brought out candles , tobacco , pipes , and Spanish wine , and seated themselves about the uncovered table . There were seven of them  --  Cox himself and , beside  | him , to the right and left , his two traveling companions , Wentzel and McNeill ; across the table from them , Johnston , Fletcher , and their two hosts of the Northwest . Wentzel had been twenty-six years in the Indian country and the service of the Northwest , twenty-six years of boreal winters , of sudden , insect-infested springs , of hazard , of treachery , of eating horse or dog or tripe de rocher , of sleeping on the ground whether marshy , dry , or stony , of solitude , in short , of the Indian trade  --  all of which would have meant very little to him if he could have felt himself justly rewarded . But year after year he heard of the promotion to the coveted partnership of favored youths who had passed their apprenticeship in easy posts , young men who had never gone hungry or cold , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montreal merchants and their friends . So Wentzel was leaving the country and the company , and not without a certain cheerful bitterness . Hector McNeill , on the other hand , as Cox said , was leaving the country for lack of some one to fight with . McNeill was an old soldier , a fighting Irishman , had served in the peninsular campaign against Bonaparte , and against the Americans in 1812 . The end of the war had found him out of work , and the Northwest , being in need of a few fighting characters in its difficulties with Lord Selkirk , had taken him over . But McNeill fought too often and too well , and the Montreal partners were inviting him to retire with their compliments and a year 's advance pay . He had a singularly military countenance , ruddy , fiercely mustachioed , and bearing above the right eye the long , transverse scar of a saber wound . He was glad to be leaving . He had come to feel the Indian trade a nefarious business , and was frank in saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since all those present save one were prospering or had prospered by it . This one was the barrister Fletcher , whom Cox had  | overtaken between Fort William and the Sault , Fletcher being then on his way back to Montreal . He had delivered the Prince Regent 's epistle to the Nor'westers and their opponents , and had made as full and exact a report of events as was possible under the circumstances . The talk began inevitably with Fort William , since Fletcher , Cox , McNeill , and Wentzel had left there but a few days before , Fletcher and Cox , at least , having seen it for the first time . From the behavior of the men whom he was sent to report of , Fletcher had anticipated something decidedly baronial , but it was one thing to expect , another to experience , the testy loyal temper of the crowd of French , half-breeds , Scotch , and Indians that thronged the wooden hall , filling it with pipe smoke , wood smoke , the smell of clothing heavy with sweat and grease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fletcher had seen it filled . The tables were arranged in feudal fashion , one for the proprietors , Montreal partners , and clerks , and , farther down the hall , those for the canoemen , guides , interpreters . At the upper end of the hall was posted Thomson 's map , six feet high by thirteen feet long , a panorama of the Northwest Territory , carrying the crosses for seventy-six  --  or was it seventyeight ? ? posts of the Northwest Company , each with its name , every line set down on the authority of personal observation , every portage indicated , every little creek and lake on the route from Fort William to the Columbia drawn with minutest care . It was a valuable possession , the finest and most complete record of the Northwest then extant , and the Hudson 's Bay Company had more than once regretted the short-sightedness which had informed Thomson , originally one of its own men , that it had no need of geographers and cartographers in the business . Through its charter the Hudson 's Bay held claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but through Mackenzie , Frazer , and Thomson the Northwest held a complete and almost secret knowledge not  | only of the Hudson 's Bay territory , but also of the vast wild country that surrounded it . Men coming in from the Northwest stood in front of the map , as Cox had done , and with a curious fascination retraced their painful journeys , and men going out for the first time tried to imagine , from its inked rivers , the eddies , morasses , rocks , decharges , carries , and stations of their tomorrow 's labors . There was also , for decoration , a portrait bust of the old Marquis , Simon McTavish himself , a full-length portrait of Nelson , and a large painting of the Battle of the Nile , these last two a gift from William McGillivray , in whose honor the fort was named . This was the hall . In the courtyard that year a number of Selkirk 's disbanded De Meurons sauntered and smoked , mingling but not exactly mixing with the Nor'westers . Cox noted a Negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were Swiss , Flemish , German , Italian , Austrian , anything that Europe had chanced to contribute to a band of mercenaries . There was also the notorious Miles Macdonell , in charge of a sheriff . Outside the stockade the Indians had pitched a village , and many of the French had joined them . The rest of the voyageurs were in little camps here and there between the Indian village and the fort . " What did they give you to eat ? " asked Fletcher in a dry , pleasant , barrister 's voice . " Oh , everything , " said Cox . " Venison , fowl , hot cakes , fish , eggs , potatoes , milk , and cheese . I had n't had cheese in years . The best victuals in the world ! " Fletcher nodded . " I was never better wined in my life . " " Yes , it 's fine at Fort William , if it 's hard on the road , " said Cox reminiscently . " Look here , " he added abruptly to one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep a hundred and twenty women and children  | on starving rations all winter . It 's bad , even for the fur trade . " " When did we do that ? " inquired his host . " At Fort Ile a la Crosse last winter . I had the news at the place . You ca n't deny it . And all this fort-taking and handy murdering . You ought really to check it  --  it 's a war . " Fletcher listened in silence , his long fingers interlocked before him on the table , his head bent slightly . He had heard the whole account , colored in many different ways , many times now , but his business was to report upon events , and he listened to each new recital , waiting for some casually revealed new fact , his face still and his eye bright , like a sparrow ready to pounce upon a crumb . Johnston , beside him , put fresh tobacco in his pipe and leaned back , deliberately relaxing against the growing tension . " Let them get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Damn them , what right have they to block the Columbia route with a strip of farms ? Stole our pemmican too . You know as well as I do , every man here knows , that the Columbia men have got to be provisioned from the Pembina . Selkirk plants his filthy Scotchmen there ? they are filthy . One of them sold his shirt to an Indian and the whole village had the plague  --  to choke the life out of us . And the Hudson 's Bay , on its antique charter , grants him half the Indian territory of the United States ! They call that legal ! " He ended with a snort . Johnston blew a cloud of smoke above the candles , and Cox laughed . " But do you have to go to war about it ? " " We offered the whole Scots settlement a free ride to Montreal , " said the Nor'wester , " and they would n't get out . The lummoxes ! " Fletcher said nothing . " What about the murder of Governor Semple ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the Nor'wester . He gave  | his glass a little push so that the sherry slopped over the top and wet his fingers . He leaned back , digging into the pocket of his smallclothes for a handkerchief , and Ross Cox picked up the conversation with his nimble tongue and conveyed it to the banks of the Columbia , to every one 's relief . " The last cheese I had , barring this at Fort William , came on the Isaac Todd . Mr. Donald McTavish , God rest his soul , brought it all the way from England for us . All the way around the Horn and nothing to eat but hardtack , and he never broached our cheese . He was a nobleman . He was drowned in the Columbia . Did any of you know him ? " " Old Henry 's nephew was drowned at the same time , I believe , " said the gentleman of the Northwest , still wiping his fingers . " There was another chap with him , " agreed Cox , " whose name escapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of the forest outside the stockade . A curious place . The ground is matted as thick as a rug with wild honeysuckle , and there 's not the sound of a bird or an insect even . The silence is a curious fact I 've noted about those forests . " " Alexander Henry the Younger , " the Northwest man completed his information . " He used to be at the Pembina . Was there when the Sioux appeared one morning and scalped his father-in-law . " " Ah , " said Cox , " a father-in-law . I think he had another at the Columbia . There 's many a better man been ruined by too many Indian fathers-in-law . The Indians have their virtues , I admit them , but their morals are as scanty as their clothing , aye , and frequently as in great need of cleansing . " " On the contrary , " said Johnston , leaning forward and resting the bowl of his white clay pipe on the bare wood of the table , the stem supported meanwhile on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their  | morals are excellent . Cleanliness is a part of their religion , and chastity , my dear fellow , that most rare element , more often to be found among them than among their white superiors . " " If you had seen a certain gentleman of the Northwest , who shall be nameless , " said Cox , leaning back in his chair and smiling broadly , " if you had seen this gentleman , as I have , and not so long ago , stuffed naked into the steaming entrails of a slaughtered horse , and the edges of the orifice tucked in neatly about his neck , and all because of his too frequent amorous relations with the chaste Klatsoop ladies . . . " He finished with a wave of the hand . Fletcher , greatly amused , said , " As a cure , how did it serve ? " " Oh , excellently , " said Cox . " It needed only three horses to restore him to comfort . He swore it was capital . I assure you , it was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the belly of a dead mare . " But Johnston , still leaning forward , his hand and his pipe still resting on the table , said : " Gentlemen , I protest . I do not speak of your outrageous Pacific tribes , which I do not know , but of a people at my very door , and with which I feel myself honored , gentlemen , honored to be allied . And now , gentlemen , I beg to be excused . " Cox , somewhat surprised , surveyed him as he stood up , in build rather portly , but erect , the flesh soft about the chin and mouth , the mouth itself at this moment very firm , the naturally ruddy face slightly pale , and the hazel eyes , in anger become black , small , and penetrating , all the more striking because of the gray and blond hair of the temples . He stood a moment with his hand on the back of his chair . Then , tossing his pipe on the table so that the long stem snapped , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instantly . At the landing , while the boatmen brought the canoe around , he made  | his apology , unable to see in the darkness the face of the man he was attempting to conciliate . Presently Johnston said : " You apologize , sir , like a gentleman . You will dine with me tomorrow . " And as a further sign of forgiveness , after the canoe had pushed off into the watery blackness , Johnston 's voice returned , " I have some excellent Irish mountain dew in my locker which never saw the face of an exciseman . " The answer of the Hudson 's Bay Company to the Prince Regent 's reprimand , expressed by Governor Williams of the company , was as follows : " I do not care a curse for the Prince Regent 's proclamation ; Lord Bathurst and Sir John Sherbrooke by whom it was framed are damned rascals . I act upon the charter of the Hudson 's Bay Company , and as governor and magistrate in these territories . I have sufficient authority and will do as I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " drive out of the country every damned Nor'wester it contains , or perish in the attempt . " The attempt included , in 1819 , a second capture of Fort William , with all its goods and stores . It also included the tragic death of a partner of the Northwest , Benjamin Frobisher , who , being captured and confined at York House , made his escape in the deep of winter and perished , before he could reach a settlement , of hunger and cold . The following year the two companies , somewhat sobered by this last death , consolidated under the name of the Hudson 's Bay Company , Alexander Mackenzie 's dream coming true to that extent . V THE mirror was long and narrow , perhaps twelve inches wide , and the fluted gold frame was also narrow . At the four corners were carved the smiling heads of young girls , and each head was crowned with grape leaves . A  | very aristocratic little mirror . It reflected in its depths a room full of ladies and gentlemen , lit by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walls were of logs , but of logs rubbed with beeswax to a fine luster , and hung with pictures in gold frames ; it reflected from its shallower surface the slightly anxious face of a serious-minded young man who had a few moments before been made to remember , for the first time in many weeks , by the sight of a charming young woman , his personal appearance . He had made himself as neat as he could before leaving the quarters which he shared with certain young army officers , but at the moment he wished to be assured of something besides neatness . There was not much time , however , in which to ruminate about the matter . Mrs. John Johnston was entertaining guests at dinner , that is , she was performing those duties which her mother would have performed in her father 's lodge and which she would have considered it beneath her personal dignity to alter in any way . She stood at the door while the gentlemen were arriving , General Cass and his staff , Lieutenant John Pierce ( brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) in charge of twenty-two soldiers from Mackinac , a guard of honor , or a precaution ; Lieutenant Eneas Mackey , in charge of the ten soldiers of the expedition ; Major Robert Forsyth , the General 's private secretary ; Captain Douglass , astronomer and topographer ; Mr. Trowbridge , assistant topographer ; Dr. Alexander Wolcot , physician ; the young Mr. Henry Rowe Schoolcraft , geologist ; Mr. James C. Doty , official secretary for the expedition ; for this was the Expedition to the Sources of the Mississippi River , sent out in the year 182o to explore the upper regions of the great river and to take note of very many other things by the way . Mrs. Johnston welcomed the gentlemen , regretted that her husband , who was then traveling in England ,  | could not welcome them also , introduced them to her daughter Jane , her daughter Eliza , her daughter Charlotte , three comely young women ranging in age from twenty years to fourteen . Behind her stood her son George , who , as head of the house in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saurin Johnston , had invited the Governor and the savants to take all their meals at the Johnston house , and who now served as interpreter for his mother , not to translate the English speeches of her guests , for she understood the language perfectly , but to translate for them the formal Ojibway greetings which she refused to give in English . She stayed with them until a certain ease of manner seemed to have fallen upon the lighted room , and then , at the moment when the guests were invited to be seated at the long table at the far end of the room , she disappeared into the kitchen , and Miss Jane Johnston occupied the place of hostess with the General at her right hand . The General was then approaching forty ; his face , not yet as jowled and heavy as in his later portraits , was nevertheless , in spite of all its ruddy health , somewhat forbidding and severe . Jane thought she had never seen so clifflike a countenance . The features seemed to retreat upward and backward , perpendicular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the high forehead against which the hair , cut short and brushed forward in the Roman manner , gave something of a Roman character . He was in uniform . He was a general , and he was also the first permanent governor of the Michigan Territory . Jane 's voice , with its cultivated Irish accent and its tremulous liquid quality , derived from her mother 's ancestry , became very low , obliging the Governor of Michigan to bend in order to hear her . He bent from the waist , as if he had a ramrod down his neck . The meal went forward in ceremonious , orderly fashion , Jane presiding and eating very little in her anxiety to see her guests well served . Jane 's face , an  | oval , faintly ivory , a little high in the cheek bones , a little wide in the jaw , had the mobility of her father 's . The line of her eyebrows wavered and flared off in a pretty arch ; her eyes were as dark as her mother 's . Her hair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silky clusters of ringlets in front of her ears , was tucked up behind with a comb , an ivory comb once her mother 's , and her hair was dark . She wore a tightbodiced taffeta dress with a round dimity collar through which a ribbon was threaded ; her ankles , tucked away under the table , were incased in black taffeta leggins brought in tight at the ankle and ruffled at the bottom like the little white pantalettes then recently in fashion for children . This was a concession to her mother , an adaptation of the leggins of the Indian women , and a rather charming one , she thought . Halfway down the table her sister Charlotte , in a similar collar , a similar dress , her hair fixed in the same way , looked like another , younger Jane . Jane , sparing an eye from the General , could see that Charlotte was being amiable , her pretty teeth showing in a smile , her head nodding , but Eliza , across the table from her , Eliza with her darker features and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal of that . The wax candles in the silver holders flickered brightly , ran off now and again into smoky points as a slight commotion in the air unsteadied their flame . The narrow goblets , half filled with port or sherry , dropped little pools of ruddy or amber light on the fine Irish damask , and a young Indian girl , stationed behind Jane 's shoulder , waited to remove or pass any dishes that might be required . But for all the order and elaborate courtesy of the meal , a slight uneasiness overhung the room . George constantly lifted his eyes to the door through which his guests had entered , and those whose backs were toward it seemed to cock their ears in its direction , listening to each other 's remarks with the  | thinnest attention . And well they might , for the events of the past afternoon had not been tranquilizing . The Expedition to the Sources of the Mississippi River , dispatched by Mr. Calhoun , Secretary of War , under the leadership of General Cass , was avowedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized , however , that in the eyes of Mr. Calhoun it had more serious things to accomplish than the collection of fresh-water shells and mineral specimens from the shores of Lake Superior and its tributaries . The British fort on Drummond Island , removed to that place after the surrender of Mackinac and the destruction of the old fort on St. Joseph 's , was attracting unto itself , by gifts , flattery , and constant endeavor , the loyalty and affection of the Indians of the north , loyalty already British and slow to change since the events of 181z and x814 . Twice since the close of the war , American military had attempted to enter the Great Lake , and twice had found it wiser to postpone the attempt , and the Secretary realized , that for all the Treaty of Ghent , and before it , the Treaty of Paris , the country beyond the Sault could hardly be considered as United States territory . Cass had received , therefore , instructions to treat with the Indians and pave the way for the founding of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this purpose he had arrived the evening before , at sunset , with his Mackinac boat , or barge , filled with twenty soldiers , and his small fleet of canoes , at the beach between the Indian green and the Johnston house , and had there disembarked and pitched camp in the long pearly twilight between eight and nine o'clock of a summer evening . The Indians who had gathered on the shore to watch him approach fired their salute , and retreated to a distance to watch him disembark , and the ladies of the Johnston family , almost as shy , promenaded the beach in front of their house observing this rapid springing into being of a small village of canvas tents .  | The expedition was encamped at the site of the old Nolin house , the Governor 's markee and the tents of the " savants " occupying the most northern position , and that nearest the Indian village . To their right , as they lay facing the river , were the tents of the escort proper of the expedition , under Eneas Mackey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the escort which had accompanied them from Mackinac . Little was attempted that night save the bare setting in order of the camp . The men , who had come that day from a point near Drummond , perhaps forty-five miles , without counting the added labor caused by the West Neebish Rapids , flesh drenched with sun and wind , exhausted , released , lay down at once to sleep . Young Henry Schoolcraft , in the group nearest the Indians and the rapids , lay awake for a short time listening to the drum  --  there was a wabbeno ceremony in progress  --  now heard by him for the first time , and to the rumble of the water beyond . The two sounds merged for him into something wild and romantic . He was aware that he was resting with a short rifle within easy reach of his hand because of that monotonous drum , but he was too fatigued to stay awake long to enjoy the sensation . The air , through which he had moved all day , fragrant and living , and since nightfall extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was asleep . The Governor 's markee became the scene of the council the next day . The sides were rolled up , making of it a tent ? l'abri ; from a short distance those outside could see quite well what took place inside . The Governor was seated before a small table , near him his interpreter , James Riley , a Saginaw half-breed , and , his secretary . The gifts for the Indians were arranged on the ground beside him . The Ojibway leaders entered in due order and seated themselves with dignity on the ground opposite the Governor . They were in full council regalia , regalia not so purely Indian as that of the councils of  | twenty years ago . Nevertheless they were as a group sufficiently strange and impressive to the members of the expedition , and it was noted by the Americans that nearly every Indian present wore on some sort of band or ribbon about his neck a silver British medal . It was high noon before the ceremonies began , with the smoking of the pipe , noon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salutations of the six directions duly completed by all the Indian delegates , Riley , the interpreter , stood up , and at the Governor 's bidding explained to the Ojibways that in times past their fathers had given or sold to the French a certain number of square miles of land there at the rapids ; that the British , conquering the French , had fallen heir to this land , and had no doubt also paid for it many times with gifts ; that now the Americans , having conquered the British , owned this land , and that , although by the right of double conquest they felt it to be theirs without a doubt , they were willing and ready to purchase it again with gifts , and they requested the present holders of the land to make it over to them with a treaty and a grant . There was a pause in which the Ojibways seemed to confer among themselves , but more by glances than by words . At last one of the old men rose , his body naked above the hips , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large silver medal ; in his hair , which was gray , eagle feathers , one stripped halfway down the line of the rib , one painted with vermilion . His face was lined with green and white . He said briefly that neither he nor his friends knew anything about such grants of land , and having said as much and no more , sat down again . No one else rose , but a murmur of assent passed down the triple rows of dark and gaudy bodies , and Riley , at a word from the Governor , made his speech again , in an attempt to impress upon these people , these essential warriors , the right of conquest by war . As the Indians neither assented nor protested again ,  | but sat in a profound negative silence , the Governor instructed Riley to proceed with the distribution of the presents . The first of these , tobacco , was brought forward and dropped in a heap before the chiefs , and ignored . The other presents , strouds , blankets , traps , kettles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reminding the Ojibways that their White Father in Washington wished them well , and hoped rather to make them presents of blankets than presents of bullets . Their White Father wished a little place on which to land . Would they not give it to him ? The Indians conferred among themselves , this time more volubly , and the nominal head of the Saulteur band , Shingabawossin , the Image Stone , rising , made a more cordial speech . His people would , he said , be happy to give the White Father a little place on which to land , but he hoped no fort would be built , and no garrison stationed on this land , because , he concluded , significantly , if a fort should be built , he was afraid his young men might " kill the cattle of the garrison . " Cass then rose and announced that the Ojibways might set their fears at rest , for as certainly as the sun which had risen that morning would that evening set , so certainly would there be a fort and garrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpreted , and the faces on the opposite side of the tent , which had begun to relax into a faint mobility , stiffened , and George Johnston , seated between the two groups , sighed inwardly . There was no lack of speeches now from the Ojibways . The afternoon wore on , the conference reaching no conclusion . Shingwakonse , the Little Pine , added his voice to that of the hostile element . Shingabawossin remained , as at first , conciliatory . The Indians grew a little restless , and one in the front row , reaching forward with the stem of his pipe , raked toward himself a twist of tobacco from the pile of gifts , with his scalping knife cut off a small piece and began to grind it to powder  | in the palm of his hand . This action precipitated into the middle of the tent a tall figure in a British officer 's coat , breech clout , leggins , and moccasins , who struck his lance furiously into the ground so that it quivered upright , independent , beside him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the Americans , but to the Indian at his feet , who held the half-mortared tobacco still in the hollow of his hand . " It is not fitting , " he announced in Ojibway , " it is not fitting that an Ojibway warrior should accept tobacco thrown on the ground like bones to a dog . It is not fitting that the Ojibway nation should accept gifts from their enemies , nor welcome them to their country . Do you wish to fill your hunting grounds with enemies that you speak of giving land to these people ? It is yet only a little while since Shingwakonse led his people to fight at Mishinimackinong . It is only a little while since I , Sassaba , fought with my brother at the river they call Thames , and my brother was killed in that fight . The Americans have not covered the grave of my brother . They have not covered the graves of the people of the Little Pine . They have not built again the houses they burned . " He turned here and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among us asking for land . I , Sassaba , I who am a chief of the Ojibways , I say they shall have no land . " Above the scarlet of his coat , the gold of the epaulettes , his face , dark and violent , painted with bear grease , indigo , and vermilion , turned slowly from face to face of those seated in the tent , the eagle feather in his hair trembling slightly with each motion of his head . He then deliberately kicked the presents which lay before him , seized his lance , and proceeding through the center of the group , left the tent at the open northern side . The crowd outside made way for him , and he went straight to the Indian village . The conference seemed to be ended with his departure . Many of the  | Ojibways got up and followed him , more slowly , it is true , and most of them taking a formal if somewhat strained farewell of their host . Cass hastened to close the procedure , and in a few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the aqueous shadow of the canvas . The Americans saw in the distance the figure of Sassaba descend a small gulley , mount , enter the village , disappear ; but shortly after , a commotion ran through all their group as the red of the British flag mounted by little jerks a flagpole in the center of the village , where it hung slack in the windless air above the gray and silvery shaggy lodges and the bristling lodge poles . The Governor was very angry . His clifflike face tightened and paled slightly and , nodding to Riley the interpreter to follow , he set off for the Indian camp , much like an irate parent on the trail of a refractory child . The gentlemen of his party , being armed , offered , and were anxious , to accompany him , but he waved them back , and they saw him , with a pace so different from that of the lithe and arrogant Indian who had preceded him , cross the little ravine , mount the slope , and disappear among the lodges . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . They waited , fingering their short rifles ; and then they saw the red flag descend from its pole . After about fifteen minutes the Governor returned , carrying the defeated emblem over his arm , and grimly humorous . He had entered Sassaba 's wigwam and lectured him roundly on the etiquette of flags . He had declared moreover that if the Ojibways should ever again attempt to fly any flag but the American on the south side of the rapids he would " set a strong foot upon their rock and crush them utterly . " It was fortunate for Cass that he had gone alone . The Indians , although they admired his personal bravery , were far from convinced by his speech , and a small armed force in company with him would have been  | II the signal for an immediate attack . As it was , the Americans at a safe distance began to clean their muskets ; the jingling of the ramrods was heard as far away as the Indian camp , and presently canoes laden with women and children and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pointing their prows toward Canada . They did not attempt to dismantle their wigwams , however , and no man left the village . Sassaba 's speech had come at the late end of the afternoon ; it was now evening , daylight and darkness balanced against each other in the air , a chillness rising from the water and the dew gathering on the grass and on the sloping sides of the canvas tents . A few small fires were lighted on the high land where the Indians waited , and the Americans were also making fires . In this somewhat fictitious quiet George Johnston stopped to renew his dinner invitation to the Governor and his staff , and took the path along the shore to the Johnston house . Near the house he met his mother , who said to him : " He is a brave man , this General , but he does not know how to speak to my people . Go back now to the village and tell the principal men to come to me here in the store . If Sassaba will come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shingabawossin . Tell them to come quietly , so that not the whole village shall know they have come , nor the Americans . " So that George , sitting in his father 's place at the long lighted table , had in his nostrils the particular odor , so deeply a part of his childhood , of the bark lodges in which he had found Little Pine , the Image Stone , and his uncle , the First Born , an odor of earth , smoke , and sweet grass , smoke-saturated clothing and burnt fish ; and beyond the fresh , rather nondescript faces of the American guests , and the glossy curls of his sisters , he saw the strongly marked features , the long thin lips , the dark jutting brows and heavy cheek bones , of these Indian cousins of his , faces of men at once so much  | more determined , serious , and self-reliant than the white men , and , in certain aspects , so much more childish . He remembered other occasions on which his father and mother had stood as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Jacob Brown seated at this same table the year after the American attempt on Mackinac , in a house so newly rebuilt that the chips and shavings had not yet entirely disappeared from the earth about the doorstep , while his father dispensed his usual hospitality as freely and serenely as if there had never been a war ; and he remembered old Nolin , the French trader , now departed , entering through the door from the kitchen , and stooping over his father 's shoulder as he conferred with him in French . In landing , that afternoon , one of the General 's escort had taken the ensign from the stern of the boat and planted the shaft of it in the sand , feeling , no doubt , something like Cortez ; an Ojibway had as promptly flourished his hatchet and with a single blow cut the shaft clean through , so that the stars and stripes wavered and fell upon the beach , to the indignation of the Americans , who would have attacked the Ojibways then and there without considering the consequences . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Indians he had sent back to their lodges , the Americans he had invited to " his bandbox " for tea . And all so easily had he accomplished this that the Americans were only amused , and their anger had dissipated itself over the teacups and among the books and pictures . Tea had prolonged itself until dinner time , and dinner had reached the stage of raisins and wine before the old Frenchman had appeared . A young Indian girl had come to him saying : " I went to Mrs. Johnston 's . They told me in the kitchen , Mrs. Johnston is giving a dinner ; she can not  | see anybody . So I come to you , but I can not stay . I crept out under the back of my lodge , and I leave a bundle all covered upon my mat where I sleep , because they have put a guard all around the village and no one is allowed to leave it . They are going to kill the Americans tonight . Not soon , but when they have gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will kill them all . " John Johnston turned from the Frenchman and related this to his guests , smiling a little ; but he concluded his explanation thus : " I have but newly received from Montreal the guns and ammunition which I have planned to use in trade this next winter . They are at your disposal , gentlemen ; my clerks will get them ready for you . And if you keep a brisk fire going tonight with a good guard , very likely there will be no trouble . I shall station my son and Mr. Holliday , my head clerk , whose acquaintance you made this afternoon , between your camp and the village , 1:tut merely for the sake of your feeling an added security ? ' The Americans sat up most of the night and , the impression of Johnston 's easy smile lingering in their minds , were not sure but that the whole matter was a lark . George and Holliday heard whistles in the underbrush near by , but no scalpers appeared . In the morning the Americans were easily persuaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way into the lake . Another time the situation had borne for the Americans an even more innocent aspect . His mother and the Indian women who helped her in the kitchen had packed for General McComb and his staff , who had then been the Johnstons ' guests for a week , several picnic hampers , with cold meats and the cakes and bread and pastries at which his sisters were so adept . His father had supervised the stocking of a liquor case , and  | although business prevented him from attending them personally on their excursion into Lake Superior , he had sent his men to convey them , and they were to travel in one of his canoes instead of in their own more slow and clumsy vessels . The canoe was sent up through the rapids first , as was customary , half loaded , and towed from the shore with a cod line , the loading to be completed at the head of the portage . The party of officers followed along the path , chatting as they went , George and his father with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the voyageurs , a chap by the name of LeClair , came back to meet them , declaring that all things were ready for " mon g  --  n ? ral et ces messieurs . " They affixed the American colors to the stern , and set off with one of those chansons without the aid of which many a difficult traverse might never have been accomplished . La fille du Roi son vout chassan , Avec son grande fus  --  e de l'argent . . . The summit of Cape Iroquois showed blue to the north across the brilliant water ; the water was ruffled but not dangerous , and it was with pleasure and not a little pride that John Johnston watched the canoe swing out and take its course for Point aux Pins . About an hour later the whole party was back in the Johnston living-room , a very excited LeClair recounting the events of the trip in a confusion of languages . We arrive , mon bourgeois , and I leap into the water to carry ashore mon g  --  n ? ral . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veritable war whoop , and this Indian who is drunk comes running down the shore and draws upon me with his pistol . It is no doubt because they have seen the flag , for this Indian , did he not sleep with me in my blanket one month ago ? But he is very drunk . God is with me , and his pistol snaps . Dieu merci , it does not go off , and I hasten and knock him down . But they are  | all drunk in this village , and as I see them coming upon me , I run back into the water and push off with the canoe . I will go back alone , myself , yes , alone , but I will not go back with ces messieurs . No . Tomorrow when they are sober those Indians will be worse than when they are drunk . I am very sorry , mon bourgeois , you may dismiss me if you like , but I can not take mon g  --  n ? ral back to that village . " He stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in a gesture of absolute refusal . Johnston was furious , not at LeClair , but at the Ojibways , for they had insulted his guests and made a mock of his hospitality . He wanted to send all his men in a body to chastise the village . He stamped up and down the room with his hands behind his back , uttering imprecations , orders , and apologies , like some old Scottish border chieftain , and then , ever volatile and amenable , had sent his men to their quarters , and called for the girls to unpack the hampers in the living-room . The picnic took place at the long table , and before it was over , Johnston felt , as did LeClair and Neengay , that it would be folly for the Americans to attempt to explore Superior that season . A band of drunken Indians at Point aux Pins might be dealt with ; beyond Point aux Pins lay river , island , and harbor , league upon league , each increasingly remote and hostile . Johnston 's indignation could not reach far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discourteous to insist . They retired to bed all vastly amused , as at some well-staged play , and in the morning set off for Mackinac with many protestations of gratitude . And now as the Governor leaned forward to catch some tremulous remark of Jane 's , and as Charlotte turned her pretty smile upon young Henry Schoolcraft , George thought of the old men in blankets and feathers who were waiting in the store or office from which his father habitually carried on the negotiations of the Indian trade . He wondered  | how much he exaggerated the risks run by these visiting Americans , and how much , secure in their status of citizens of the United States , they underestimated the danger . Certainly the power of the United States far exceeded the power of these dark relatives of his , and certainly his relatives would inevitably feel it . In the meantime they did not know that they were about to be conquered , and they were capable of doing infinite mischief . Into his concern for the safety of these men who were his guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited in the log outhouse for a word of moderation and forbearance . That evening Shingwakonse was wounded in the shoulder by Sassaba . It was the only casualty of the night , and it occurred on the path from the Johnston house to the Indian village . After the guests had departed George joined his mother in his father 's office . She had already been there for some time ; the council was well under way , and the small room thick with smoke . They handed George the pipe when he entered , and after he had saluted the six cardinal points and returned the reed with its red sandstone bowl and its ornaments of feathers to Shingabawossin , his mother said : " Tell them , ningwizzis , tell them , my son , that what I say is true . The day is past for them to resist the Americans . It is now the day for them to receive them kindly and make brothers of them . It is true that many have been killed . It is time now to cover their graves with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it shall be done , but the Ojibways must make gifts also . " So George made his speech . He explained that the Americans were numberless , that they would keep coming forever , that it would be impossible ever to kill them all . He said : " This is the hour in which to choose . This is the hour in which to make them friends or enemies , " and ended his oration with this sentence : " The firing of one gun will bring ruin to your tribe and to the  | Chippewa nation , so that not a dog will be left to howl in your villages . " The room was quiet when he sat down . The faces were turned to Neengay , who was motionless , her face calm and authoritative , showing neither reproach nor fear . She did not urge them further , but she was the daughter of the man who had never counseled them wrongly , whom success had followed as the fawn the doe , and who , twenty-seven years after his death , had become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had , moreover , power over the white race , and these people had been her guests . At last Shingabawossin rose and , putting aside his blanket from the shoulder , held out his arm , braceleted above the elbow with a band of virgin copper , the arm extended full length before him , palm down . " My mother , " he said , " you are right . You think of the happiness of your people . Sassaba thinks only , I have lost a brother . ' Shingwakonse will go to Sassaba , and will say to him for us , Stop what you are now doing , put away your war club . ' " He gathered his blanket about him and sat down . Shingwakonse did not go unaccompanied . Most of the council , including the Johnstons , followed him . They met Sassaba on the portage road , stripped of his scarlet coat and epaulettes , naked save for a breech clout and moccasins , and painted from head to foot . Shingwakonse halted him in the name of the council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sassaba stopped in the middle of the path , whirling his war club above his head , and declared : " Shingwakonse , you also led your people against the Americans six years ago . I now lead mine again . You can not stop me . " And , quite without warning , he brought his war club down straight before him in a terrific blow . The Little Pine dodged , without shifting his feet , and received the blow , glancing , on his left shoulder . Little Pine then addressed himself  | to the Indians who had assembled at the back of Sassaba , and prevailed upon them to return to their lodges . Neengay followed them into their village . Shortly before midnight the council reconvened in Johnston 's office , all the principal men of the tribe except Sassaba being present . They sent for Cass , and the treaty of June 16 , 1820 , was drawn up and signed . Shingwakonse , proud of having two cognomens , set his name down as Lavoine Bart . The treaty granted four square miles on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserved for the Ojibways the right to fish , in the rapids in perpetuo . The gifts which bought this priceless acreage were brought forward then and there and distributed , and George Johnston sent to the house for two bottles of wine and for tobacco , with which eternal friendship was pledged between all those present . For the Ojibways it was the beginning of the end . They were not to be deported , like the Potawatomis , exiled into unfamiliar and hostile territory ; they were to stay where they were , in their own country , to be gradually obliterated by the inevitable tide of settlers . There was one person at the council who realized the fact powerfully if dimly , and this was Neengay . She had done what she could for her people , but her heart was sad . General Cass , having thanked her personally , indited a letter to her husband , in England , praising her , and saying that the United States could never repay the debt of gratitude it owed her . The camp between the village and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signing of the treaty , did not dismiss its guards until daybreak . The Indians of the expedition , ten Ottawas , taken along in the double capacity of canoemen and hunters , at the first threat of hostilities declared their neutrality . They would not , they said , do anything to harm the Americans ; neither would they carry arms against their own people . One young Ojibway , who had been added to the party  | at Mackinac , came to the Governor and asked for ammunition and a musket . He asked to be stationed between the camp and the Indian village . This young savage went by the name of Buck , and Mr. Trowbridge , hearing his request to the Governor , and knowing of the refusal of the Ottawas , set him down in his reminiscences as the hero of the occasion , after the General and Mrs. Johnston . It was some fifteen years before Schoolcraft discovered that Buck translates into Ahdeek , and that this particular Ahdeek was the youngest son of Waub-ojeeg , the White Fisher . VI JULY , 1822 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his middle , fastened in such a way that the brush hung down behind and beat against his thighs as he walked , paraded down the portage path , gesticulating fiercely and mysteriously to the atmosphere . He entered the French village and proceeded down its single street , stopping to peer in windows , to shake doors that sometimes opened to him and sometimes did not . There was no malice in his actions , but an intense , thwarted fury , and he occasionally beat himself on the breast . He was very drunk . The season was early summer and both the villages , French and Indian , were filled to overflowing with returned trappers and canoemen . The Indian village , increased to perhaps three times its usual winter size , was extended by row upon row of lodges and campfires ; the Canadian village had built no more houses ? it was simply crowded . From nearly every door came the sound of revel , although it was still morning . Billiards and cards and wine were the chief amusements . In the evening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green a very lively game of boggatiway was in progress . Little naked boys , and girls almost  | as naked , ran whooping with netted sticks after a deerhide ball , which they caught up in the nets and flung hither and yon . John Johnston was busy in his office , receiving visitors from L'Anse Kewenon , from Ontonagon , from La Pointe , checking off debts as certain Indians brought in their promised bundles of fur , extending credit , granting charity . The kitchen of the Johnston house , where Neengay was most often to be found , was full of Indians , coming or going , or seating themselves on their heels to wait for a visit with Neengay , or for a gift of bread . Indians who had suffered all winter with pleurisy , detained at their trapping grounds by the need of food or by the appalling white drifts , waited now for Johnston to come with his gleaming little lancet to give them relief . All the tales of the winter  --  of death , of illness , of birth , stratagem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neengay in the Johnston kitchen , and all the remedies she could devise from the traditions of her people , from practical knowledge , and from her husband 's tradition and experience  --  herb teas , castor oil , balms , unguents , charms even  --  were accepted with respect and gratitude by these people who seemed to become , winter after winter , more and more susceptible to illness and disaster . And meanwhile Americans in uniform were cutting timber in the woods , hauling logs , sharpening picket stakes ; and the old Nolin house , once called the Ch  --  teau of the Northwest Company , was being dismembered and remodeled , for Fort Brady was under construction , to occupy the ground once occupied by the Old French Fort , then by Cadotte and the Northwest Company , then by old Nolin . The holes for the pickets of the stockade were dug four feet deep . The pickets , all cedar logs six inches thick sharpened on the ends , were planted side by side , as close as they could be placed , standing twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | down to the water 's edge and into the water in order that in time of siege the garrison should not be cut off from so necessary an article . In places the old stockade of the Northwest Company 's Ch  --  teau was allowed to remain . For Jane and Charlotte the Sault had become overnight a metropolis . In the tents , pitched in the form of a square between the Johnston residence and the foundations of Fort Brady , were several young American women with their small children , families of the officers of the garrison , transplanted from Sacketts Harbor , New York . They brought the latest news of fashion , the newest wrinkles in housekeeping , but they made the girls smile when they asked where they might purchase fresh vegetables and lamb chops . It was true that the Johnstons occasionally had lamb chops , that , in the winter , they had bacon and smoked ham , and , very rarely , beef , but this was only when their father made up his mind to have slaughtered one of his prized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Johnston kitchen consisted of venison , bear meat , rabbit , or wild fowl , and as for vegetables , they had them from their own garden while the season lasted . They were happy to make the ladies a present of some , but they never sold them . In the garden , picking currants from the row of hardy bushes , they discussed the ladies minutely , and when the currants were picked Jane went into the house for a pair of shears , and began to cut fresh flowers for the vases , for at noon the new Indian agent , who was none other than that interesting Mr. Schoolcraft of General Cass 's expedition , would be there to lunch with them . Her father had taken a great fancy to him , and had found in him a man to appreciate the cabinet of curios which he had been collecting these twenty years . Jane was very quiet in their presence ; she doubted if Mr. Schoolcraft noticed her at all . But the flowers seemed important .  | Sassaba staggered , and reaching his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , laid his head on his outstretched arm for a moment and wept . He was still in the French village and he was undoubtedly very drunk . Among the British his nickname had been the Count , but not since the ceremonies for the installation of the Indian agency , some eight days ago , had he worn the scarlet coat with the gold epaulettes , nor the gilt-handled sword , which had once given him so much pleasure . On that day , a day of crystal , Colonel Brady had drawn up his troops in the form of a hollow square , and inside this wall , brilliant with color and military trappings , all the important Ojibways of the village , both men and women , had been received while Brady introduced them to their Little Father , Henry Schoolcraft , who was to be the ear of the Great Father at Washington , in order that the Great Father and his children might speak together and understand each other . All the Indians said , " Hoh ! " to this , in sign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . Then Schoolcraft had stepped forward and read the speech which he had carefully prepared earlier that morning in the privacy of his room . The Indians were well impressed by this also ; the paper impressed them . This led to the distribution of presents , and to another speech by Colonel Brady in which he promised the Ojibways that he would not attempt to set his fort or any of his buildings either upon the familiar site of their village or on the high land near the eastern end of the rapids , the land which had been since time immemorial their tribal burying ground . This promise brought a chorus of " Hoh 's " from the Indians , but from Sassaba it brought a brief but violent speech , which was never interpreted . John Johnston , standing , as George had stood at the council two years ago , between the Americans and the Ojibways , turned abruptly upon Sassaba and rebuked him sharply  | and briefly . This rebuke was not translated either . The council paused . Sassaba looked at Johnston , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was had spoken to him thus , with a certain surprise , and then , with an expression of greatest pride and grief , had left the council and had not returned . For the rest , Schoolcraft recorded in his journal that the event had gone off as well as he could have wished , and he hoped for increasingly cordial relations with his Indian charges . He even made a profound promise to himself to study the customs and the language of this strange people in order to be able to deal more justly and amicably with them . Meanwhile , in Sassaba 's tent , which was neither of deerskin nor bark nor woven appukwas , but of canvas , and which had formerly been his pride , the red coat lay unconsidered ; and with it a bundle consisting of a sash , a pair of gloves , a pair of silk stockings , a pair of English shoes , an umbrella , and two white linen ruffled shirts , once opened frequently for the edification of visitors , remained untouched , and slowly , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell . These were not his only foreign treasures . He had also cups and saucers , knives and forks , a dozen silver teaspoons , a dozen tablespoons , and a silver tea tray . With these he put his silver British medal . The flag , in which they had all been wrapped in days gone by , was in the possession of Governor Cass . Sassaba clutched hard at the rough whitewashed wood and rolled his head slowly from side to side , face downward on his arm . Already the children were calling him My-een-gun , the Wolf , and learning to keep a safe distance from him . At three o'clock , since the Johnstons dined at four , Jane and Charlotte were setting the table , laying the silver knives and forks on the freshly ironed damask . The sibilance of their skirts followed them from place to place , and Jane 's face , as she bent above her light work , was contented and sweet . She had not been well  | the winter before  --  many unimportant infirmities , slight colds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid succession  --  but the summer weather was doing her good . Before they had finished they saw , through the open window , their father and Mr. Schoolcraft enter the garden , and proceed slowly toward the house , stopping often to chat , or pausing over a plant or a flower . Since his return from Ireland Mr. Johnston had taken to using a cane . A dropsy in the leg and ankle made him limp , and he felt besides a sort of fatigue , an advancing shadow of old age , which made him find a pleasant security in the companionship of a bit of polished hickory . His hair had grayed in the last few years also , and visitors remarked merely " traces of the original Scotch yellow . " He stooped a little . He had hoped while in London to obtain some recompense from the government for his losses during the war , and , meeting Ross Cox on the street while there , had declared to him his belief that he was about to have some success . His hopes had dwindled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the British would not do anything for him . Their reason was that he had been living on the American side . Perhaps if . they had been victorious they would have been more generous . The Americans also refused to recompense him in any way for the havoc caused by the unauthorized raid of Captain Holmes , on the more reasonable ground that he had borne arms against the United States . Thus he saw himself bound to stand his losses alone . While in Ireland he sold his mother 's estate of Craige , which gave him a certain amount of ready money . The business went on ; his credit was as good as ever in Montreal and Quebec ; his charity to his red neighbors and hospitality to his white ones as openhanded and princely as ever ; but he knew himself to be heavily encumbered with debts . This was not the heritage he had been preparing for so long for his children . He came down through the garden with Henry  | Schoolcraft , talking of verbs and nouns in the Ojibway language , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present tense , which had no gender but which were divided into the classes animate and inanimate  --  all very strange to Schoolcraft . Poor Henry ! He had hired an interpreter for the agency , an Irishman by the name of Yarns who was married to an Ojibway woman and who may have spoken the language correctly enough , but who had never heard of a noun , let alone the gender or declension of one . But to talk of the language with a man who could not only speak it perfectly but also read Latin with ease was a pleasure . Neengay came from the kitchen and went to the door to meet them , her invariable custom . They waited until Dr. and Mrs. Wheaton and Captain Brant , the quartermaster , joined them from the fort , and then sat down at table , Jane , as usual , in the place of hostess , Neengay in the kitchen . The work on the fort was going forward rapidly . They had all heard so much , these newcomers , of the swift descent and severity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were outdoing themselves in preparation for it . The old Northwest Ch  --  teau , nicknamed by the soldiers the Hotel Flanagan , was being repaired wherever that was possible and made into quarters for the officers . Part of it was fit for nothing but demolition . A few small stone houses in its precincts had been turned over to the physician and the quartermaster of the garrison . Johnston had rented such small buildings as he could spare , originally bunk houses for his men , or guest houses for the Indians who often descended upon him with their families for a week at a time . Schoolcraft had one of these , a log structure , fourteen by sixteen feet , with windows front and back and a mud-and-stick fireplace in one corner . He had rather despised it upon first glance , but had found it comfortable , and , such was the crowded state of the Sault , French village and all , with this sudden influx of soldiery  | and traders , he considered himself very lucky to have it . The garrison was well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew , not only to intimidate the savages and give courage to the settlers , but to make friends with this red and hostile nation . However , in less than a week they had unwittingly done two things which disturbed the Indians very much . They lacked the intuitive sense for superstition which had kept the French from wounding the feelings of the Indians . There was , between the cantonment and the wood where Brady planned to cut the most of his timber , a small rise of ground on which grew a few scattered shoots of mountain ash , or Scotch rowan , and all about the roots of this tree or trees were little piles of withered rowan twigs . Brady directed the men to construct a road sixty feet wide from the wood to the fort , and in doing so , the men , a little puzzled by the twigs , but not for long , cut down the ash and cleared away the d  --  bris . But these innocent-looking shoots sprang from the root of a manido tree , a tree sacred since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the little mound at its foot were consecrated offerings placed there generation after generation by hunters going north or south on the near-by trail . The tree , it was said , made the sound of a wabbeno drum , had made it for generation upon generation , and was very sacred . It had blown down only a few years before , but the Indians continued their offerings to its spirit , rising in young green withes . Now it was both destroyed and insulted . How could the Ojibways be sure that the manido would understand that the desecration had been performed by white hands instead of red ? A few days later something even more annoying to the Indians , but more easily remedied , occurred . In time of illness the Ojibways were accustomed to cut a long sapling , peel it , and decorate it with paint , feathers , and small gifts , and erect it at the door of the lodge of the sick person , a conciliatory offering  | to the manido who might be causing the illness . An officer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calmly appropriated one of these manido poles , stripped it of its decorations , and set it up in the fort . The owner very promptly came after it , and , in panic lest his patient suffer for the insult , redecorated it and re  --  stablished it on the spot from which it had been lifted . The village was deeply stirred by this event , and considering the fact that the officer stood at the edge of a whole forest of flagpoles , to be had for the mere cutting and hauling , perhaps the Indians were justified in their emotion . These things gave Henry Schoolcraft something to worry about , and he looked forward to his hours in the Johnston household , where he was always certain to pick up some important bit of Indian information . He let his correspondence slide , and spent his spare moments gossiping with Indians who were not anxious to answer his questions , and bois br  --  l ? s , or half-breeds , who were more willing , but who sometimes included a strange element of superstition in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Brittany and the loup-garou . He first heard from the bois br  --  l ? s and the Indians of the existence of one Waub-ojeeg , who , for a week at least , he classed with Mud jekeewis , the West Wind , and according to some stories the father of Manibush . Later , Jane brought this legendary person down to earth for him . He heard also of a sacred fire which had been kept burning at Chegoimegon since the day when the Ojibways had first brought it there from Mackinac . He heard of the enchanted canoe of Mishabou ( Manibush , Manabozho , Nenbozho ) which was propelled and guided by a word , and before the month was over he was impelled to write in his journal : " Nothing has surprised me more . . . than to find that the Chippewas amuse themselves with oral tales of a mythological or allegorical character . Some of these tales . . . are quite fanciful . . . . The fact , indeed , of such a fund of fictitious  | legendary matter is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the race than any trait I have heard of . Who would have imagined that these wandering foresters should have possessed such a resource ? " Pushing through the copse at the head of the portage trail , followed by the two men he had requested of Colonel Brady , Henry Schoolcraft came quite suddenly upon the murdered man . The Indian lay in the grass before him , a fragrant tangle of yarrow , daisies , feathertopped grasses , and strawberry leaves . His head was incased in a sort of blue skullcap and around his brow were fastened eagle feathers in a coronal . He was dressed in his best , and the body was stretched out as if for Christian burial . He had been stabbed twice , once in either thigh , but the blow which seemed to have accomplished his taking off was evidently that of a hatchet or small tomahawk . The scar was very small , and directly between the eyes . A little farther up the shore among the still , thick bushes of scrub willow they found his lodge and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sky , and he had been killed by one Gaulthier when both of them were drunk . Gaulthier had fled . Schoolcraft gave orders to the men to remove the body and have a coffin made for it . He promised the woman that it should have a new blanket for a shroud and be buried at the expense of the Government . The interment took place that evening at the old Ojibway burying ground . Before the wooden box was closed , an old Indian stepped to the foot of the coffin , and , looking down at the quiet face , began : " Soan-go-gezik , we are sorry to have you go . We shall miss you in our camping places . You have been a good hunter , a good man to your wife , a good neejee to your people . You were sometimes drunk , like all of us , but you did not promise things that could not be so . Now you are going away . When you come to Gitche Genabik ,  | the Great Serpent , do not be afraid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him boldly . Cross the stream . When you come to Gitche Oodaymin , the Great Strawberry , do not eat of it . When you come to the Lodge of Reindeer say to my son , say to my son , Soan-go-gezik , that I am coming soon . " The brother of the Strong Sky then came forward , and , removing the blue skullcap , cut a lock of hair from the dead , replaced the skullcap , straightened the blanket with a touch . They covered the coffin then , and lowered it into the grave , and placed two poles side by side across the narrow trench . The same old man who had spoken before now called upon the brother of the Strong Sky to perform a brother 's part by the widow , and the brother , obedient to the old man 's instructions , taking the widow by the hand and treading on the two poles previously laid down , led her across the open grave . This seemed to end the ceremonies . The grave was filled in and a fire kindled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the flame seemed established and steady . As the orange tongue sprang up , making visible the faces of those on the far side of the freshly broken earth , Schoolcraft was for a moment surprised to see the face of his hostess , Mrs. Johnston . He had grown used to seeing it in company with those of her children in her orderly garden or pleasant living-room ; he had forgotten for the moment that she also belonged among these people . The widow did not leave the place , but stayed there through the night , tending the fire . The three successive nights , also , as Schoolcraft left his papers and books and , before going to bed , stood a few minutes in his doorway to breathe the sweet night air , he saw beyond the village the faithful fire which was lighting the Strong Sky on his perilous four days ' journey . The day after the burial he questioned Little Hawk , the brother of the Strong Sky , about the status of the widow , with the intention of making some sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
