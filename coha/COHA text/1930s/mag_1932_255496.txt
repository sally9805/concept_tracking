Hub Stores Home . The Lyttons , father &; son , were back in control of Chicago 's four Hub Stores last week . Henry Charles Lytton , now 86 , started the first store 46 years ago with $12.700 capital . He spent $2,500 for fixings , $3.500 for advertising . In March 1929 , when the Hub Stores were reported doing a $10,000,000-a-year business they were sold to Fashion Park Associates . Inc. , for stock then worth $7,000,000 , now worth i/'iooth as much at market prices . How much it cost the Lyttons to buy back their stores was not disclosed . <P> Father Lytton sat behind his desk last week and , as " last survivor of the old State Street merchants . ' ' received congratulations and spoke of new policies . But he will soon leave for his winter home near Monte Carlo and the actual management will be handled by his unusual son George Lytton , president . <P> George Lytton is famed in Chicago for having founded the 44-piece Business Men 's Symphony Orchestra which gives about six concerts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28 , keeping two handy in his office . But boxing , not music , is his real hobby . Now a sparse man of 58 , his muscles are as tough as they were when 40 years ago he started to work for his father and installed a gymnasium next to ' his office . For some years he was considered amateur heavyweight champion and boxed with such fighters as Jim Corbett , Bob Fitzsimmons , " Battling " Joe Choynski . When the Illinois Athletic Club was opened in 1904 he took on Jack Johnson . At the end of the fight Johnson said , " I will back Lytton against anyone in the world . " Merchant Lytton was a judge at the controversial Tunney-Dempsey fight in Chicago . <P> Christmas Payment . Depositors in Manhattan 's defunct Bank of U. S. will receive a 10% payment by Christmas , it was announced last week . This will bring total disbursements to $75,000,000 , or 55% of the total deposits . A further payment of at least 15% , is hoped for next spring . <P> Receiver for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has millions of dollars to invest and you also control hotels with mortgages for sale there is an obvious temptation . Chicago 's Stevens family , which used to own the Stevens ( " World 's Greatest " ) Hotel and the La Salle Hotel , also controlled Illinois Life Insurance Co. , a concern with $150,000,000 in policies outstanding , half of them in its home state . Legally , if unwisely , Illinois Life bought $11,000,000 worth of mortgages and securities in the two hotels , both of which have passed into receivership . <P> Last September Illinois Life , hard-pressed for cash , borrowed $1,000,000 from the R. F. C. Apart from causing interest because it showed that the R. F. C. was aiding life insurance companies , the loan excited comment because it was made on the condition that new directors be drafted , control removed from the Stevens family .
