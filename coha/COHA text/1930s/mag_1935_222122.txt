To head the fast-growing Japanese-dominated " Autonomous Government " in North China headed by twerpish-looking Mr. Yin Ju-keng. who deceives nobody by styling himself " General , " , a thumping Chinese Big Name was badly needed last week by Japan . <P> It was a grim joke to Chinese when Mr. Yin 's hired Chinese mercenaries , escorted by Japanese troops , last week " captured " Tangku , port of Tientsin . If a renowned Chinese Marshal with a name the world knows had enjoyed the same success it would have been psychologically much greater . At week 's end cables from Tientsin announced that the great " Scholar War Lord , " Marshal Wu Pei-fu , had agreed to end eight years of erudite and pious seclusion in a Buddhist monastery to rule North China . <P> If this were true the crude , raw North Chinese militarists who for years have sat uneasy saddles , galloping for &; against Japan but galloping chiefly for themselves , are in for a new regime at Peiping with every trapping of intellectual subtlety and elegance . Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the days when Wu Pei-fu was mastering scholarship and the composition of fragile poems on expensive paper with a jade-handled ink brush . <P> In their unphilosophic and unscholarly impatience 5,000 male &; female students demonstrated against Japan last week in Peiping . Afterward over 100 were hospitalized as a result of severe beatings by Chinese police . One youngster offered his slim torso with the cry " Beat me more ! " and was obliged . <P> U. S. funds support Peiping 's famed Yenching University but its chancellor is a Chinese of wisdom , Luh Chai-wei . " If this goes on , " he said , " I believe we will have to close Yenching . If the students demonstrate again in Peiping , I fear the police will shoot into their ranks . " <P> In Nanking last week the Chinese Government , reorganized with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek as Premier , were in daily diplomatic , negotiation with the Japanese Government , trying to save what they could . It appeared certain that North China would not obey Nanking 's order to ship all silver stocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit her prospective new puppet state to be drained of silver , and 2 ) North Chinese owners of silver prefer to keep it in North China , no matter who governs the area .
