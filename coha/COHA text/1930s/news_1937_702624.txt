txt Dispatches from London last night tended to confirm reports that Stanley Baldwin 's government has broken its pre  --  abdication agreement with Edward , duke of Windsor . The duke 's friends charged that the agreement was not carried out , pointing particularly to the royal family 's boycott , at the behest of the government , of the wedding of Ed. ward and Mrs. Wallis Warfieid . Details on page 2 . BY EDMOND TAYLOR . Chicago Tribune Press Service:I MONTS , France , May 19 . ? Stung by the decision of official England to cut his wedding , the duke of Windsor , former King Edward VIII . of . Great Britain , today served notice on the world that he will expect his wife to be referred to as " her royal highness . " This timely reminder from Edward to the people over whom he once ruled and to the government which forced him to abdicate his throne that whether they liked it or not he is , still a member of the British royal ? family slipped out quite innocently in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cantle with Herman L.

" a correspondent asked . would think , she automatically would be called that , " Rogers replied . The drama back of this simple question and answer is not obvious at first glance , but it is there all right . It is self-evident that Europeans at least , and Americans who go in for titles , will . call Mrs. War . field " her royal highness . " But it was just as self evident a week ago when Rogers was asked the same question . At that time the reply was that information on this point would not be forthcoming until after the coronation . Bishop and Baldwin Object . The reason was that the idea of calling " that woman " her royal highness sticks in the craw of the Anglican bishops and Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin . ?

It is true , that Rogers did . not volunteer the information , but there can be no doubt he would not have let it be drawn out a him if he had not gotten Edward 's approval beforehand . Telling the world that from June 3 on it will be " her royal highness , the duchess of Windsor , " was unmistakably a deliberate countersnub aimed at the British snootocracy and a dignified but effective way of getting under the skin of the government which Edward feels double crossed him .

However , it chiefly is interesting as an indication that Edward is tired of playing the role of he who gets slapped and is beginning to hit back at those who have not played the game with him as he played it with them . ? To Be Married by Mayor . Further evidence of the rift was the ' announcement by ' Rogers that there will be no consular ceremony , and ' that the marriage will be performed under the French civil code by Mayor Dr. Charles Mercier of Monts . That leaves only one tie and that a doubtful one linking the marriage of the former ruler with his own land and traditions . That is a religious ceremony following the civil one with a prelate of the .

The marriage will be at noon on Thursday of June 3 , he revealed . Last night at the ch ? teau a pre-nuptial contract was drawn up between Ed. ward and Mrs. Warfield in accord . ante with French custom , and this morning the contract was deposited with a notary in Tours .
