Although the watered-down Left policies of moderate Premier Camille Chau-temps have been strongly endorsed by French voters at their local polls ( TIME . Oct. 25 ) , the Government set out last week to nip anti-Left revolt which may be budding in North Africa . Many of this colony 's landed proprietors , while French in citizenship , are of Spanish . Italian . South American or even German birth . Almost to a man they are more conservative than the Communist . Socialist and moderate Radical Socialist parties which in coalition support the Chautemps Cabinet . Notoriously German are many tough mercenaries of the famed French Foreign Legion . The natives are Mohammedan , excellent fighters , and their chiefs are even more anti-Left than the landed proprietors . Why then should not a French commander of much the calibre of General Franco arise in North Africa and ultimately secure in France results as extensive as his in Spain ? <P> Such a question can only be answered by a show of naked force . The French Cabinet last week answered it by ordering So first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after squadron , beginning October 27 , for extensive maneuvers over all French possessions in Africa , including the Sahara Desert and French Somaliland as well as North Africa . After these war birds of Paris and the moderate Left have scared the Fascist daylights out of as much of French Africa as possible , the most potent bombers will fly on to impress Madagascar and finally French Indo-China . <P> The Chautemps Cabinet further showed it meant business last week by vesting dictatorial powers for the governing of North Africa in a close friend of the Premier , onetime Premier Albert Sarraut . ' ' You are instructed . " M. Sarraut was told . " to present a survey of the colonial situation to the Cabinet as soon as possible and to outline the measures of control you intend to take . " <P> The Cabinet figured it had acted none too soon when news came that Moroccan natives 1,000 strong had risen at Khemisset with knives and guns , were besieging the French garrison which had barricaded itself . Ten planes followed by troops from Rabat forced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed sentenced 70 arrested persons to prison terms of from one to ten years , restored quiet .
