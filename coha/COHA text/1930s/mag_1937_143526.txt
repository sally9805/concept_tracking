While the Broadway air twangs with the sobs of commercial producers launching flops and losing money , many real theatre-lovers this season are going off by themselves to experiment with unusual plays . Typical is The Play Room Club , sponsored by Maxwell Anderson , Brock Pemberton et al . Planning to present five plays throughout the season , admitting only members and their guests , the club last week led off with The Infernal Machine by Jean Cocteau , adapted by Carl Wildman . <P> In a brick-walled room that was once a foundry , seated on 65 folding chairs , the audience applauded a modern version of an old story of incest and parricide .

To The Play Room audience Cocteau 's attempt to make the legend significant in modern terms seemed so sincere that his anachronisms , his references to Theban nightclubs , and the sprinkling of slang did not sound forced . Jean Cocteau , once called " the most charming young man in Paris , " has always been a good showman . He has frequently set Paris on her ear with his expressionistic ballets . His surrealist film , The Blood of a Poet , produced visceral chills wherever it was jeered or cheered . His pictures drawn under the influence of opium are monstrous and unforgettable . Critics have found Cocteau difficult to classify . His Oedipus says , " Classifiable things reek of death . You must strike out in other spheres . . . quit the ranks . That 's the sign of masterpieces and heroes . An original , that 's the person to astonish and to rule . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
