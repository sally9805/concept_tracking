When Is a Child ? <P> Sirs : <P> In TIME , Jan. 9 the statement is made that the Board of Tax Appeals reserved decision on the question whether Y. M. C. A. Wilson 's embryo offspring was fiscally a child because the board lacked a precedent to go by . <P> Militarily , Mr. Wilson has a child . <P> Instructions for filling out the draft questionnaire in 1917 permitted a married man to state that he had a child if his wife was pregnant . I was a member of a county draft advisory board , and so advised a friend whose marriage took place later than a certain date after which marriage was considered a means of evading or deferring military service . His statement that he had a child because his wife was pregnant , was challenged , but it stood up , and he got a deferred classification because of offspring , not spouse . <P> Since the Federal Government made such a ruling then , perhaps the Board of Tax Appeals would consider it a precedent now . <P> DON C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The outcome of Lloyd Wilson 's appeal interests me very much . A very capable and highly regarded local C. P. A. is of the opinion Wilson 's case will be considered a " frivolous appeal " and that he will be fined $500 . He has been unable to find the case in the Board of Tax Appeal Service . <P> SAM PARK <P> Beaumont , Tex . <P> &gt; Because the Bureau of Internal Revenue grinds slowly , the Wilson case ( No. 96577 ) will not be decided for some time . But it is unlikely that Lloyd Wilson will be fined for frivolity . Of some 96,000 cases heard since 1924 , only two have been held frivolous. - ED . <P> " &; Power " <P> Sirs : <P> In your report on my debate with Mr. Gannett TIME , Jan. 23 you refer to " International Paper Company , which once owned stock in Gannett papers . . . . " According to all reports , including that of the Federal Trade Commission , the name of the firm is International Paper &; Power Co . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of the debate , Mr. Gannett , too , tried to make a distinction between the Paper and the Power Company , as if they were separate enterprises . <P> TIME in particular should know that this is not so . I quote from TIME 'S sister , FORTUNE ( May , 1930 , Vol . I , No. 4 , p. 67 ) : <P> " But for the last few years President Archibald Robertson Graustein has fought the battles of paper and pulp with one hand , while with the other he has built up the second enterprise equally gigantic , and at first glance unrelated . International Paper is now the world 's chief producer of newsprint ; its new ( 1928 ) parent , International Paper &; Power Co. is one of the world 's largest producers of power . <P> " On March 27 , 1929 , Mr. Graustein announced that I. P. &; P. had bought 82 per cent of the common stock of the New England Power Association . . . . " <P> Let me repeat : It is International Paper &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary of the Interior Washington , D. C. <P> Hitler 's Den <P> Sirs :
