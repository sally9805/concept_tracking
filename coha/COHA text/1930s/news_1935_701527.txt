txt Smoke from a fire in a basement linen room of the Michael Reese hospital ascended late last . night into the corridors of the first and second floors of the main . hospital building and alarmed a number of patients . Members of the hospital staf , headed by the superintendent , Dr. Herman Smith , allayed their fears and firemen , arriving promptly with a large amount of equipment , extinguished the flames after chopping holes in the floor of a first floor hallway . Dr. Smith said that it was not necessary to move any of the patients and that the amount of smoke that reached their rooms was not great . Lights on the first floor were turned off as a precautionary measure . Because of the supposed danger to those in the hospital , a large number of ambulances were hurried to the I scene and a crowd collected .
