In process of assembly last week in Manhattan 's American Museum of Natural History was the skeleton of a 74-ft. dinosaur , a 130,000,000-year-old relic not much different in appearance from a few other such relics in a few other U. S. museums . This monster 's recent history , however , was unique . <P> The skeleton was discovered some years ago by diggers from Pittsburgh 's Carnegie Museum which had long been probing the great dinosaur graveyard in the desolate badlands near Jensen , Utah . Having sent an abundance of bones back to Pittsburgh , the Carnegie men left the skeleton partly exposed for tourists to gape at , other diggers to retrieve . In due time a party from Washington 's Smithsonian Institution arrived , began busily to exhume the remains . They quickly discovered that the neck vertebrae were missing . When high &; low search failed to disclose them , it was decided to remove the neck from another dinosaur which lay nearby and which seemed to be of the same species . The neck and the neckless skeleton were shipped back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next on the site was a group of scientists from the University of Utah . They set about disinterring the second skeleton , found that the neck was missing . Investigation revealed that the Smithsonian Institution had the neck . The harassed Utah diggers then discovered that their skeleton also lacked a tail . Investigation revealed that the tail had been encountered some yards away from the body by the original Carnegie party , had been sent back to Pittsburgh . <P> While all concerned pondered the fact that the skeleton was scattered like the pages of a Gutenberg Bible-the neck in Washington , the tail in Pittsburgh , the head and body in Utah-the Smithsonian made the cataclysmic discovery that its neck and the rest of its specimen were of two different species . <P> Into this roiled situation stepped a kindly bystander , the American Museum of Natural History , to help &; advise , mediate &; make peace . So tactful was the peacemaker that when the smoke had cleared it was observed that the dismembered monster-the neck from Washington , the tail from Pittsburgh , the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maw of the American Museum . <P> This final chapter was explained by the Museum 's bald , able Paleontologist Barnum Brown . " It was done , " said Mr. Brown , " by trading . "
