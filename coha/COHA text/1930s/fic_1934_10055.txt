added . " Tell the lads I ' 11 come over when there ' s work for the forge . " The shadows were long in the clearing , for it was late after noon . Grass was already beginning to hide the ashes about the blackened stumps . As he sat on the doorstep of his house , the slope of the ground to the west gave Williams a view of the sea above the tree-tops . Snow-white terns , in pairs , sailed back and forth overhead . It was their mating season and they were pursuing one another , swooping and tumbling in aerial play . No wind was astir ; the air , saturated with moisture , was difficult to breathe . Williams rose , cursing the heat , went to the small cookhouse behind his cabin , and kindled a fire to prepare his evening meal . At last the sun set angrily , behind masses of banked-up clouds , dull crimson and violet . It was not a night for sleep . The blacksmith was on foot before dawn , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his way to Christian 's house . Alexander Smith wakened at the same hour . Like Williams , he had tossed and cursed the heat all night , between snatches of fitful sleep . He opened the door , rubbed his eyes with his knuckles , stretched his arms wide , and yawned . The moon , nearly at the full , was still up , though veiled by clouds in the west . The big red rooster in the purau tree flapped his wings , crowed , and regarded the ground with down-stretched neck and deep , explosive cackles . With a prodigious noise of wings , he left his perch and landed with a heavy thump . One after the other , the hens followed , and each in turn was ravished as she touched the ground . The last hen shook herself angrily , the cock made a final sidewise step with lowered wing , and glanced up at his master as if to say : " Well , that ' s over with ! Now for breakfast ! " Smith grinned . The fowls followed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coconut-grater stood . Seating himself astride the three-legged stool to which the grater of pearlP101shell was lashed , he began to scrape out the coconut meat , a crinkled , snowy shower that soon filled his wooden bowl . He stopped once to fill his own mouth , and chuckled , as he munched , at the impatience of the fowls , standing in a wistfulcircle about the bowl . He rose , calling , as the natives did , in a high-pitched , ringing cry , and while the fowls came running with outstretched wings he scattered grated coconut this way and that . Hearing the familiar call , the pigs in their . sty under the banyan tree burst into eager grunts . " Mai ! Mai ! Mai ! " respondedSmith , gruntingly , and strolled across to empty the half of his coconut into their trough . He had the seaman 's love of rural things . It was now broad daylight . Balhadi came to the door , greeted her husband with a smile , and went to the cookhouse to prepare his breakfast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the water barrel for his morning wash . After scrubbing his face vigorously with a bit of tapa , he made the morning round of his plants . A fenced enclosure , of about half an acre , surrounded his house , and he derived keen pleasure from the garden he had laid out inside , with its stone-bordered paths and beds of flowering shrubs . Spring was coming on fast . He walked slowly , stooping often to examine the new growth or to inhale the perfume of some waxen flower . Now and again , as he straightened his back , he paused to glance at his newly completedhouse . Young was not a strong man , nor clever with his hands , and Smith had put up the building almost alone . He still derived from the sight of his handiwork a deep and inarticulate satisfaction . It was a shipshape job  --  stoutly built , weatherproof , and sightly , with its bright new thatch . The Indians said that such thatching would last ten years . Balhadi was calling him to eat . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youthful , with a firm , good-humoured face . Smith felt a real affection for her ,  | expressed in robust fashion . He pulled her down to his knee , gave her a resounding kiss , and fell to on his breakfast . Ten minutes later he shouldered his axe and strode away to his morning 's work in the bush . " Alex ! Alex O ! " Tetahiti was hailing him from the path . He and Smith were good friends , and both loved fishing . " I came to fetch you , " said the native . " Can you leave your work till noon ? There is wind on the way , but the morning will be calm . I have discovered where the albacore sleep . " Smith nodded , and stood his axe against the fence . He followed Tetahiti down the path that led to Bounty Bay . They passed Mills 's house , and McCoy 's , and halted at the dwelling of the natives , not far from the landing place . The men had gone to their work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fetched the lines . Hutia was nowhere to be seen . " Look , " said Tetahiti , " we 've octopus for bait . I speared two last night . " The sea was fairly calm in the cove , sheltered from the westerly swell . The native selected a dozen longish stones , weighing three or four pounds each , and tossed them into the smaller of the two canoes . They were soon outside the breakers and paddling to the northwest , while Tetahiti glanced back frequently to get his bearings from the land . At a distance of about a mile , he gave the word to cease paddling . " This is the place , " he said , as the canoe lost way and floated idly on the long , glassy swell . " I have been studying the birds for many days ; this is where the fish cease to feed on the surface , and go down to sleep in the depths . " Each man had a ball of line two hundred fathoms or more in length . One end was tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from the centre of the ball , the hook was attached . They now baited their hooks and made fast theirp103sinkers , with a hitch that permitted the stones to be released by a sharp jerk . " Let us try at one hundred fathoms , " said Tetahiti . Smith lowered his sinker over the side and allowed the line to run out for a long time , until a knot appeared . He pulled sharply and felt the hitch unroll and the release of the sinker'sweight . Then , moving his line up and down gently , to attract the attention of the fish six hundred feet below , he settled himself to wait . The sun was well up by now , but the horizon to the north was ominous . There was not the faintest breath of wind ; even at this early hour the heat was oppressive . " We shall have a storm , " remarked the native . " The moon will be full to-night . " Smith nodded . " Christian thinks so , too . " " Your ears are opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our tongue like one of us ! " " I have learned much from you . What day is this  --  what night , I mean ? " " Maitu . To-night will be hotu , when the moon rises as the sun sets . " Smith shook his head , admiringly . " I can never remember . We whites have only the names of the seven days of our week to learn . Your people must learn the twenty-eight nights of the moon ! " " Yes , and more ; I will teach you the sayings concerning maitu : A night for planting taro and bamboo ; an auspicious night for love-making . Crabs and crayfish shed their shells on this night ; albacore are the fish at sea . Large-eyed childrenand children with red hair are born on this night . ' . . . Mau ! " He shouted the last word suddenly as he struck to set the hook and allowed his line to run hissing over the gunwale . Smith watched eagerly , admiring the skill with which Tetahitihandled the heavy fish . Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full half-hour the two men sweated in silence as they played their fish . Smith 's was the first to weaken . It lay alongside the canoe , half dead from its own exertions  --  a huge burnished creature of the tunny kind . Holding his tight line with one hand , Tetahiti seized the catch by the tail while Smith clenched his fingers in the gills . A word , a heave in unison , and the albacore lay gaspingin the bilges  --  a magnificent fish of a hundred pounds or more . Smith clubbed it to death before lending Tetahiti a hand . The sea grew lumpy and confused as they paddled back to the cove . A swell from the north was now rolling into Bounty Bay , making their landing a difficult one . Minarii was awaiting them on the shingle . He helped them pull the canoe up into the shade . " You come none too soon , " he said . " The sea is making up fast . You are weary ; let me carry your fish . " He fastened the tails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than two hundredweight to one shoulder , and led the way up the steep path . It was nearly noon . The workers had returned from the bush , and smoke went up from the cookhouses of the little settlement . Minarii set down his burden at the native house , and made a sign to his man Hu to cut up the fish . The women gathered about , exclaiming at sight of the catch . There was neither buying nor selling among the Polynesians . When fish was caught , it was shared out equally among all members of the community , high and low alike , a custom alreadyfirmly rooted on Pitcairn . " I will carry Brown 's share to him , " said Minarii . Hu and Te Moa slung the remaining shares between them on a pole , and walked up the path , followed by Smith . McCoy 's Mary stood before her house . She was great with child and had trouble in stooping to take up the cut of fish dropped on the grass at her feet.  | " Hey , Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of fish for ' ee . " McCoy and Quintal appeared in the doorway . " Thank ' ee , Alex , ye ' re a lucky loon . Albacore ! " " Aye , " put in Quintal . " Next best to a collop of beef ! " After a stop at the house of Mills , Smith dismissed the two natives at his own door and went on to Christian 's house , Balhadi accompanying him . She carried a gift of a taro pudding , done up in fresh green leaves . " For Maimiti , " she explained . " This may tempt her to eat . " " When does she expect her child ? " " Her time is very close  --  to-day or to-morrow , I think . " Christian met them at the door and Baihadi carried the fish and her pudding to the cookhouse . " A fine albacore , Smith ! " " I reckon he ' d go a hundredweight , sir ! " said Smith with a fisherman 's pride . " And Tetahiti got one might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a feed of ' em . " " Stop to dine with us . " " I hate to bother ye , sir , at a time like this . " Christian shook his head . " No , no ! Jenny ' s here , and Nanai , to lend a hand . They ' 11 make a little feast of it , with your girl . They ' re funny creatures , brown or white ; birth and death are what they love . Come in . " " Thank ' ee , sir . I 've a cut of fish for Jack ; I ' 11 just hang it up in the shade . " " He left not ten minutes gone . Come in and rest before we dine . They ' 11 be giving us some of your fish . Do you like it raw , in the Indian style ? " " Aye , sir , that I do ! " " And I , when prepared with their sauce of coconut . We think of the Indians as savages , yet we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what we ' d do without ' em , here . We ' d get no fish without the men to teach us how to catch ' em , and as for the girls , I reckon we ' d starve but for them ! " They were sitting by the table in Christian 's room , for Maimiti could no longer climb the ladder to the apartment upstairs , and the dining room was set aside for her use . The two men were silent for a time while the chronometer beside them ticked loudly and steadily . Christian glanced at its dial , which registered the hour in Greenwich , and the sight set his thoughts to wandering back through the past  --  to his boyhood in Cumberland and on the Isle of Man , to his early days at sea . " Had that old timekeeper a voice , " he remarked , " it could tell us a rare tale ! It was Captain Cook 's shipmate on two voyages , traveling thousands of leagues over seas little known even now . It began life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pitcairn 's Island . " Smith nodded . " Like me , sir ! " he said . " Were you born in London ? I took you for a country-man . " " Aye , Mr. Christian ; born there and reared in a foundling 's home . I ' m under false colors here . My real name is John Adams ; the lads used to call me Reckless Jack . ' I got into a bit of trouble and thought best to sign on as Alexander Smith . " Christian nodded , and asked after a brief pause . " Tell me , Smith , are you contented here ? " " That I am , sir ! My folk were countrymen , till my dad was fool enough to try his fortune in London . It ' s in my blood . Happy ? If ye was all to leave , and give me the chance , I ' d stop here with my old woman to end my days . " Christian smiled . " I am glad , since I fetched you here . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty years . There will be broad plantations , new houses , and children  --  many of them  --  I hope . "  | " And yours ' 11 be the first-born , sir ! " Jenny appeared in the doorway , carrying a platter of fish . She smiled at the two men , and beckoned Balhadi in to help set the table . An hour later Smith rose to take his leave . " Ask Williams to come down to the cove this afternoon , " said Christian . " We shall need all hands to get the boats up out of reach of the sea . " A heavy swell from the north was bombarding the cliffs as Smith made his way over the ridge . The heat was sultry , though the sky was now completely overcast , and he knew that the wind could not be far off . Williams met him at the cottage door . " Come in , Alex . Set ye down . What ' s that  --  fish ? A monster he must have been , eh ? Here , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The blacksmith 's cat , a fine tabby whose sleekness proved her master 's care , was mewing eagerly , and Williams paused to cut off a small piece for her . " She ' s spoiled , " he remarked . " D ' ye think she ' d look at a rat ? But I hate rusty tools and scrawny living things . " As they entered the cottage , Smith observed , on the floor close to the bed , a round comb of bamboo , such as the women used . Next moment , out of the corner of his eye , he saw Williams kick it hastily under the bed . He glanced about the neat little dwelling appreciatively . " Ye ' ve the best-built house of the lot , " he said , " and the prettiest to look at . Aye , it ' s small , but all the better for that . " " What d ' ye think of the weather , Alex ? " Williams asked . " It ' 11 be blowing a gale by night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian wants all hands at Bounty Bay . He ' s afeared for the boats . " The blacksmith nodded . " I ' 11 come along with ye , " he said.  | The wind was making up from the northwest , with heavy squalls of rain , and before the two men reached the cove it hauled to the north , blowing with ever-increasing force . It was late afternoon when the people began to straggle back , up the steep path to the settlement . The boats and the two canoes had been conveyed to the very foot of the bluff , far above where they were usually kept , and it seemed that no wave , no matter how great , could reach them there . But at nightfall the gale blew at hurricane force . The deep roar of the wind and the thunder of breaking seas increasedas the night wore on . The rocky foundations of the island trembled before the onslaught of wind and wave . There was little sleep for anyone , and there were moments when it seemed that only a miracle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came at last . Toward seven o'clock Smith went trudging up the path to Christian 's house . The wind was abating , he thought , though the coconut palms along the path still bent low to the gusts , their fronds streaming like banners in the gale . Smith glanced up apprehensively from time to time as a heavy nut came whacking to the ground . Once , in a place where the path was somewhat exposed , he staggered and leaned to windward to keep his feet . Each time a great comber burst at the foot of the cliffs , he felt the ground tremble underfoot . At last he reached Christian 's house . The sliding shutters on the weather side were closed , but the door was open in the lee . Smith found Christian in the room , with Jenny and Taurua . " Balhadi is with her , " Christian said , drawing the newcomeraside and raising his voice to make it heard . " The pains have begun . What of the boats ? " " Gone , sir , all but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea ' s higher ' n ye ' d believe ! All was snug1p109an hour back . Then a roarin ' great sea came in and carried away both canoes and the small cutter . And when the wind had cleared the air of spray , we looked out , sir , and the old Bounty was gone ! " Christian paced the floor nervously for a minute or two , stopping once to listen at the door of the other room . Then , halting suddenly , he addressed Taurua : Go in to her , you and Jenny ; say that I am going down to the landing place and shall not be long . " He turned to Smith . " Come , there is nothing I can do here at such a time . " They found Young and a group of men and women at the verge of the bluffs , crouching to escape the full force of the wind while they watched with fascinated eyes the toweringseas that ran into Bounty Bay . Speech was impossible , but Young took Christian 's arm and pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lain wedged among the rocks . No trace of her remained . The waves were breaking high among the undergrowth at the foot of the path , and during the brief lulls , when the spray was blown ashore , Christian saw that the cove was a mass of floating rubbish and uprooted trees , and that avalancheshad left raw streaks of earth where the sea had underminedthe steep slopes toward Ship-Landing Point . The gale was abating when at last the three men turned to make their way back to Christian 's house . At the door they heard faintly , between gusts of wind , the wail of a newborn child . The door of the other room opened , and Jenny and Taurua came in , with the smiles of women who have assisted at a happy delivery . Balhadi appeared behind them . She beckoned to Christian . " E tamaroa ! " she said . " A man-child ! " As she closed the door behind him , Christian saw Maimiti on a couch covered with many folds of tapa ; and close beside her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an infant who stirred and wailed from time to time . Maimiti looked pale and worn , but in her eyes there was an expression of deep happiness . Balhadi pulled back the tapa that muffled the baby 's face . " Look ! " she said proudly . " Was ever a handsomer boy ? And auspiciously born ! You know our proverb : Born in the hurricane , the child shall live in peace . ' " Young smiled when Christian came out of the room . " It is fitting that your child should be our first-born , " he remarked , as he held out his hand . " What shall you name him ? " " Nothing to remind me of England , " replied Christian . " Smith , Balhadi has proven herself a true friend to-day . You shall be the child 's godfather . Give him a name . " The seaman grinned and scratched his head . " Ye ' 11 have naught to remind ' ee of England ? I have it , sir . Ye might name him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The father smiled grimly as he consulted his calendar . " It ' s a good suggestion , Smith . The day is Thursday , and the month October . Thursday October Christian he shall be ! " He glanced out through the doorway . " Here come the others ; set out the benches . " The other mutineers and their women were approaching the house . One after another , the men shook Christian 's hand , while the women filed in to seat themselves on the floor by Maimiti 's couch . When the benches were full , Christianraised his voice above the roar of the wind . " There ' s a question that calls for a show of hands . Shall we issue an extra grog ration to-day , and drink it here and now ? " Every hand went up , but McCoy asked anxiously : " How much ha ' we left , sir ? " Christian drew a small , worn book from his pocket and turned the pages . " Fifty-three gallons . " McCoy shook his head gloomily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glasses were full , the men toasted the child in the next room :  --  " A long life to him , sir ! " " May he be as good a man as his father ! " McCoy was the last to drink . He watched the filling of his glass with deep interest , and sniffed at the rum luxuriously before he took a sip . " I ' 11 nae drink it clean caup out , " he said apologetically , and then , as he held the glass aloft , " Tae our first bairn ! I 've run ' ee a close race , sir . My Mary ' 11 hae her babe within the week ! "  |p112WITH  the warm spring rains of November , the planting of the cleared lands began . The weather was too sultry for hard work when the sun was overhead ; the men went out to their plantations at daybreak , rested through the hot noon hours , and worked once more from mid-afternoon till eveningdusk . Smith , Young , and Christian had joined forces in clearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbish had been burned and the smaller stumps pulled , and the volcanicsoil , rich and red , lay ready to nourish a crop of yams . On a morning toward the middle of the month , the three men set out well before sunrise , taking the path that led south , up the long slope of the plateau , and over the ridge . No wind was astir , a light mist hung over the tree-tops , and the fresh spring verdure was beaded with dew . A party of women , ahead , took the path that branched off to the east . Presently , with Christian leading the way , the men toiled up the steep trail to the ridge , and came to a halt Dropping the heavy basket of lunch , Smith was the last to seat himself . The place commanded a wide prospect to the north  --  over the rich plateau , christened the Main Valley , to the misty greyish-blue of the sea beyond . It was a custom , well establishedby now , to rest here for a few minutes each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The upper rim of the sun was touching the horizon , gliding the small , fluffy , fair-weather clouds . The clearings in the Main Valley were not as yet extensive enough to be visibleailp113from the ridge . From the sea to the bare summits of the ridges , virgin forest clothed the land . Here and there , the silvery foliage of a clump of candlenut trees contrasted with the dark green of the bush , and scattered coconut palms curved up gracefully to their fronded tops , sixty or seventy feet above the earth . In the valley below , the women were at work beating out bark cloth . Each tapa-maker had her billet of wood , fashionedfrom the heart of an ironwood tree , and adzed flat on the upper surface . They varied from a fathom to a fathom and a half in length , and were supported on flattoppedstones set in the earth , so spaced that no two beams gave forth the same note when struck . They were , in fact , rude xylophones ; the women derived great pleasure from the musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when several of them worked together . " Tonk , tink , tonk , tonk ; tinka-tonk , tink ! "  --  the deliberate notes were sweet , measured , and musical . Young loved the sound of them , which expressed to him the very spirit of rustic domesticity , of the dreamy happiness of the islands , of morning in the dewy bush . Presently the men rose and made their way down the slope of the Aute Valley , to the glade where Brown 's cottage stood . The seed yams , fetched from Tahiti , had been planted early in February in a good-sized clearing near by . The gardener and jenny had tended them till they were ready to be dug , weeding the rows carefully , and watering the young plants in times of drought . They had been left in the ground until October , and stored on platforms in the shade , out of the reach of rats and wandering swine . A slender column of smoke rose from Jenny 's cookhouse . The gardener was on his knees , absorbed in potting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parent tree . Christian approached so softly that Brown started at the sound of his voice . He rose stiffly , dusting the earth from his hands . " Morning , sir . " He smiled at Young and gave Smith a friendly nod . " What ' s to be planted today , Mr. Christian ? " " Have you many more of the long yams ? The tahotaho ? " " Aye . There ' s a-plenty . To my way of thinking , they ' re the best of the lot . " He led the way to a large raised platform , under a spreadingtree . It held two or three tons of sprouted yams , all of the same variety , and averaging no less than fifty pounds in weight . While Christian chatted with the gardener , his companions went to the cookhouse and returned with half a dozen bags of coarse netting and three carrying poles . Each bag was now filled with yams , handled gently in order not to injure the sprouts . Young 's load was made light , but Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poles . In a land where wheels and beasts of burden were unknown , no other method of transport was possible . Christian squatted , settled the stout pole on his shoulder , raised himself upright with a grunt , and led the way to the new clearing . It lay about four hundred yards distant from Brown 's cottage , in a westerly direction , and the feet of the three men had already worn a discernible path through the bush . The land sloped gently to the south , hemmed in by high green walls of virgin forest . Christian dashed the sweat from his eyes when he had set down his load . The hills were to be about a yard apart , and all had been well lined and staked the day before . Young set to work at cutting up the yams , so large that many of them sufficed to plant twenty-five or thirty hills . Side by side on two rows , Christian and Smith began to ply their mattocks , digging a hole at each stake , filling it in with softened earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bits of yam , pressing the earth down carefully over each.  |p115The  two men worked doggedly till nearly ten o'clock , striving to keep ahead of Young , never halting , save to spit on their hands and take fresh grips on their mattock hafts . They had cast their shirts aside , and the sweat streamed from their shoulders and backs . The sun was high overhead when Christian flung down his mattock and wiped his face with his bare forearm . " Avast digging ! " he said to Smith . " Aye , sir ; I ' ve had enough . " Young followed them to a shady spot where they sluiced their bodies with water from a large calabash . Smith wanderedaway into the bush and was back before long , with a cluster of drinking coconuts and a broad leaf of the plantain , to serve as a cloth for their rustic meal . He drew the sheath knife at his belt , cut the tops from a pair of nuts , and offered them to his companions . Christian threw back his head and finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled as he tossed the empty nut away . " We ' ve a rare island , " he remarked , " where grog grows on the trees ! " " What have the girls given us to-day ? " inquired Young , glancing at the basket hungrily . Smith spread the plantain leaf on the ground and began to remove the contents of the basket , displaying a large baked fish , the half of a cold roast suckling pig , cooked breadfruit , scraped white and wrapped in leaves , and a small calabash filled with the deliciouscoconut sauce called taioro . The three men seated themselves on the grass and were beginning their meal when Jenny appeared , carrying a large wooden bowl which she set down before them . " A pudding , " she explained . " I made two . " When she was gone , they fell to heartily , dining with the relish only hard work can impart . The fish disappeared , and the crisp , browned suckling pig ; the pudding of taro and wild arrowroot , covered with sweet coconut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I ' m for a nap , sir , " he said , as he rose to his feet with some difficulty ; " I ' ve stowed away enough for three ! " Five minutes later he was snoring gently in the shade of a purau tree , a stone 's throw distant . Christian turned to Young . " There ' s a good man , Ned , " he remarked . " Yes . I ' ve come to know him well . Had he been reared under more fortunate circumstances . . . " Christian nodded . " He ' s a fine type of Englishman , and a born leader , I suspect . Life ' s wasteful and damned unjust ! What chance has a man in the forecastle ? Who can blame him if he diverts himself with trollops or dulls his mind with drink ? Not I ! Smith deserved a better chance from Life . He has the instincts of a gentleman . " They fell silent . The sun was now directly overhead , and presently they moved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their backs to the trunk of an ancient candlenuttree . " Seamen are a strange lot , " Christian remarked , presently . " You and I have been together since the Bounty left Spithead , and now we shall pass the remainder of our lives on this morsel of land . Yet I know nothing of you , nor you of me ! Where was your home , Ned ? Tell me something of your life before you went to sea . " " I was born in the West Indies , on St. Kitts , and lived there till I was twelve years old . " " I 've been there ! It was eight  --  no , nine years ago . We cast anchor at Basseterre to load sugar , and I had a run ashore . I was only a lad at the time . " " We lived just outside the town , at the foot of Monkey Hill . I loved the island , and was unhappy when sent away to school . Here in the South Sea I feel more at home than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ islanders ! My own boyhoodp117was passed on the Isle of Man . My first speech was the Manx , not unlike the Gaelic of the Highlanders . " Christian smiled , half sadly . " I can still hear the voice of our old nurse , singing the lament for Illiam Dhone . " " Who was he ? " " William Christian , my ancestor  --  Fair-Haired Illiam ' in our language . He was executed in 1663 , for high treason against the Countess of Derby , then Queen of Man . He was innocent . " For two hours or more , till Smith wakened , they chatted idly of the past . Then , as the shadows began to extend eastward , the three men fell to work once more . It was dusk when they laid down their mattocks and filed homeward , past Brown 's cottage and over the ridge . The summer proved warm and rainy and the yams grew well . They were ready for digging when autumn had dried out the soil and June ushered in the winter of 1791 . Midway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the communal storage platforms , called pa f atas , had been set up . Supported on stout posts higher than a man 's head , and floored with a grating of saplings laid side by side , the four large platforms were designed to hold twenty tons or more of yams . As with the fish , so with the fruits of the earth ; all hands were to share alike . As the yams were dug , the men fetched them in on their carrying poles and passed them up to the women , one by one , to be stowed aloft . The long yams were laid crisscross , to allow a free circulation of air ; day after day the piles grew higher , till at last , toward the middle of the month , it was announced that another day 's work would see the harvest home . Four large hogs were killed that night , scalded , scraped , and hung from the branches of a banyan tree . There was a sense of rejoicing in the houses , of deep satisfaction withp118a communal task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people began to assemble by the platforms , exchanging good-natured banter as they eyed the preparations for their evening feast . Hu and Te Moa had been appointed cooks , and were already engaged in scraping out pits for two large earth ovens , one for baking the hogs and one for ti roots , yams , taro , and other vegetables . McCoy slapped the smooth white flank of one of the hogs . " Ye ' re forbid to Jews , and no true Scot ' 11 eat ' ee , but bide here till Will McCoy comes back ! " He turned to Quintal : " Vivers for all hands , Matt ! Gin we ' d ilk a tasso ' grog ! " Quintal grinned , and at that moment Christian came around the turn of the path . He was carrying his small boy , now eight months old , and Maimiti followed him . McCoy caught his eye . " Ca n't ' ee spare a sup o ' grog for to-night , sir ? Just a wee tassie all round ? " Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left . It was agreed to save that for medical stores . " " Aye , sir , " replied McCoy regretfully . " So it was , I mind me ; I ' 11 say nae mair . " Presently the men took up their poles and bags of netting ; several of the women accompanied them to lend a hand as they scattered to the different parts of the island where their plantations were situated . Christian handed young ThursdayOctober to his mother , shouldered his pole , and took the path with Smith and Young to the Aute Valley . All day long the yams came in and were stowed aloft , without a halt for dinner or a rest at noon . At sunset the pa f atas were bending under their loads , and every soul on Pitcairn 's Island , save Minarii and his wife , was there by the ovens , still covered with heaps of matting and breadfruitleaves.  |p119Minarii  had cleared and planted the largest field on the island , and his crop was the heaviest of all . Aided by Moetua , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , in the dusk of evening , they were fetching in the last load . A shout went up from the natives as they came in sight . Minarii was in the lead , half running , half walking , with bent knees . His carrying pole was a mighty bludgeon of hardwood , but it curved and swayed with the man 's movements , for no less than two hundredweight of yams was suspended from either end . Behind him came Moetua , trotting under a load Young or McCoy could not have lifted from the ground . As the couple set down their burdens , several of the natives , men and women , sprang forward to lend a hand . Prudence and Nanai swarmed up the posts of the nearest pa f ata and squatted , clapping their hands . Up went the yams , of forty , fifty , and sixty pounds weight , to be stowed amid shouting and much good-natured mirth . Tararu was about to heave up the last of them when Minarii laid a hand on his arm . " For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content with his first fruits . " Christian nodded to the two cooks . " Open the ovens ! " he ordered . When Minarii and his wife returned , bathed like the others , and the woman with a wreath of flowers on her hair , the feast had been spread on a stretch of level lawn . Christiansat at the head of the rustic table , and below him the men faced each other in two lines . The women had their meal at a little distance , and a bright fire of coconut husks burned between . Two hours later , when the last of the broken meats had been gathered up and the natives were drumming and dancingin the firelight , Christian took leave of the company , Maimiti followed him , with her sleeping child on her arm.  | " A happy day , " he said , as they strolled homeward in the starlight . " We have begun well here . Your people and mine were like brothers to-night ! " It was past midnight when the fire was allowed to die out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees . Still the doors of the houses remained closed , and the people slept . Only Minarii was afoot . In the first grey of dawn he had taken the path to the marae , bearing a little offering of first fruits for his god . Uncovering his shoulders reverently , he had climbed to the rude platform of stone and laid the basket of food on Ta'aroa 's altar . Then , after a brief prayer , supplicating the acceptance of the offering and the continued favour of the god , he had set out to return to his house , where he meant to rest throughout the morning . Upon reaching the summit of the Goat-House Ridge , he seated himself on a flat rock to rest . The sun was above the horizon now ; the sky was cloudless , and there was a light , cool breeze from the west . No music of tapa mallets came up from the wooded depths of the Main Valley ; all was still save for the occasional long-drawn crowing of the cocks . He drew a deep breath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to which the white captain had led him , was a good land . The fish from this sea were sweet ; pigs throve here without attention ; as for yams , who in Tahiti had seen the equal of these ? He had had many wives , but Moetua was the best of them , though she had never borne him a child . A fine , strapping girl , a fit mate for a man like himself ! And she had no eyes for the other men . He rose , stretching his arms wide as he turned , and glanced casually and half instinctively around the half-circle of horizon to the west . Suddenly his easy pose became rigid . For a full minute or more he gazed westward , hands shadingp121his eyes . Then he turned and plunged down the steep path toward Christian 's house . Christian , clad only in a loin cloth , was scrubbing himself by the water cask at the rear of the house when Minarii arrived . He hailed the native man cheerily , then paused , with the calabash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What is it , Minarii ? " he asked . " I have been on the ridge . Chancing to glance westward , I saw that something broke the line where sea and sky meet . It gleamed white when the rising sun shone upon it . Christian , it is a sail ! " Christian 's face was impassive . " You are sure ? " he asked . Minarii. nodded : " It is a white man 's ship . Our sails of matting are brown . " " Is she steering this way ? " " I could not make out . " " Find Smith , " said Christian . " Tell him to come to me at once . " Maimiti sat on the doorstep , suckling her eight months ' boy . Christian stopped for a moment to caress her hair and to gaze down tenderly at his son . When he came out of the house , spyglass in hand , Alexander Smith was striding up the path . " We are going to the Goat-House , " Christian told the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Minarii 's news . " We ' 11 stop on the mountain till we make certain of her course . It is too early for a ship sent out from England to search for us , but a British vessel may have put in at Matavai by chance and learned of the mutiny from the others there . She would be on the lookout for us . " Both men were panting when they reached the summit , and both turned their eyes westward , where a speck of white broke the line of the horizon . Christian rested his glass in the fork of a scrubby tree , focused it , and gazed out to thep122west . Three or four minutes elapsed before he lowered the glass . " She ' s hull and courses down , " he said . " I can make out topsails , topgallants , and royals when they catch the sun . " He handed the glass to Smith , who scrutinized the distantvessel long and earnestly . " She ' s steering this way , sir , " he said at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foretopmaststaysail . " Christian soon convinced himself of the truth of Smith 's words , and they turned to go . " With this westerly wind , she ' 11 come on fast , sir , " remarkedSmith . " Aye , " replied Christian grimly , as he picked his way down the steep path . " She should be close in by one o'clock . " He said no more till they were approaching the house . Halting at the door , he turned to Smith . " Go at once to Brown and Williams , and tell any others you meet on the way . Every fire must be put out . I want all hands , men and women , to assemble at McCoy 's house . Tell them to waste no time . " " A ship is coming , " he told Maimiti , when Smith was gone . " Unless they make a landing , we have nothing to fear . I am going to warn the others . Do you stop here and gather together everything we possess from the ship  --  plates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well hidden . Should they land , we will conceal ourselves in the bush till they are gone . " At Young 's house , Christian stopped to explain the situationand to give his orders . Half consciously , he had taken command of the island as if it had been a ship . All fires were extinguished and the mutineers set to work with their women collecting every article of European manufacture , in preparation for flight to the bush . When all were assembledbefore McCoy 's house , Christian revealed his plan.  | " She is making direct for the island , " he said . " If the wind holds , she will fetch the land within a few hours . From the cut of her sails she is a small English frigate . She can not have been sent out in search for us , but it is possible that she touched at Tahiti and learned of the mutiny there . Our course is clear in any case . If they pass without making a landing , they must not know that the island is inhabited . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and remain hiddenthere , with everything that might betray us as white men . " He paused , and the men spoke rapidly in low voices among themselves . " Williams and Mills , " Christian went on , " I leave the smithy to you . See that the bellows , the forge , and the anvil are safely hidden , and every trace of Williams 's work removed . Young , the path leading up from Bounty Bay must be wiped out and masked . Take the Indian men . Yours is the most important task of all ! Pile stones in a natural manner here and there on the path , and plant young ironwood trees between ; their foliage will not wilt for a day or two . McCoy , take charge of the houses , and see that nothing remains to betray us . Smith , you shall be our lookout , and report instantly should the ship change her course . And remember , no fires ! If they land , we shall repair at once to the grove of banyan below the Indian temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slapped the stock of the musket in his hand . " Find us or not , " he growled , " I do n't mean to be taken . Not while I 've powder and lead ! " " Are ye daft ? " asked McCoy . " One shot ' d be the ruin of us all ! " " Aye , " said Christian sternly , " McCoy is right ! " The people dispersed to their tasks and Christian walked back to set his own house in order . Smith followed and stopped at the door while the spyglass was fetched . Less than two hours had passed when Smith returned . " She ' s an English man-of-war , sir , not a doubt of it ! A frigate of thirty-two , I reckon , and coming straight on for the land . " By early afternoon Christian 's orders had been carried out , and the people were assembled not far from McCoy 's house and a quarter of a mile from the landing place . The path leading up from the cove had been masked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after a final inspection by Christian the workers had made their way separately up the bluff . The ship was now close in ; Smith was stationed on a point that jutted out beyond a small ravine , to hail the others when she rounded the northern cape . Christian was admonishingthe group of men and women on the grass . " She is a man-of-war , and there will be a dozen spyglasses trained on shore . When she comes in sight , the women must remain here . Maimiti , you will see to that ! The men shall go with me to the point , but once there , we must take care not to be seen . " There was a rapid murmur of conversation as he ceased . to speak , broken by a hail from Smith . The ship had rounded Young 's Rock and was now little more than a mile from Bounty Bay , and at a distance of about three cable lengths from shore . Her courses were clewed up ; she came on slowly under her topsails , before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men followed him down to Smith 's lookout point . The place was well screened by bush and about three hundred feet above the beach ; the rise to the plateau was steep enough here to merit the name of cliff . Each man chose for himself a peephole through the foliage , and seated himself to watch the progress of the ship . There were exclamationsfrom the mutineers :  --  " She ' s English , not a doubt ! " " A smart frigate , eh , lads ? " Nearly an hour passed while the vessel coasted the islandp125slowly , sounding as she approached the cove . The men peering through the bush could see the red coats of marines , and a stir and bustle amidships as she drew abreast of Bounty Bay . A boat was going over the side ; presently , with two officers in the stern and a full crew at the oars , she began to pull toward the cove , while the frigate tacked and stood offshore . Though the wind was westerly , there was a high swell from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet as the boat drew near the breakers . At a sign from him , the men ceased rowing , and the cutter rose and fell just beyond the first feathering of the seas . " They ' 11 never chance it ! " muttered Young . Christian nodded without taking his eyes from the boat . " She ' s been to Tahiti , " growled Mills , " ye can lay to that ! Thank God for the swell ! " The taller of the officers , a lieutenant from his uniform , was raising his spyglass to scan the rim of the plateau . For a long time the glass moved this way and that while the officer examined the blank green face of the bush . At last he snapped his telescope together and made a sign to the rowers to return to the ship . Hove-to under her topsails , she was a good mile offshore by now , and the cutter was a long time pulling out to her . Through his glass Christian watched the falls made fast , and the sway of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Presently the courses were loosed and the frigate slacked away to bear off to the east.  |p126BY  the end of the year , the swine had multiplied to an extent which made it necessary to fence all the gardens against their depredations . The fowls , wandering off into the bush , had gone wild and regained the power of flight lost in domesticity . The women caught as many as they required in snares , baited with coconut ; when a man wished to eat pork , half an hour 's tramp with a musket sufficed to bring a fat hog to bag . Sometimes they shot a fierce old sow , ran down the squeaking pigs , and fetched them in to be tamed and fattened in the sties . During the breadfruit season , from November till May , the trees planted by the ancient inhabitants of the island producedmore than enough to feed all hands . The pandanus abounded everywhere ; its nuts , though somewhat laborious to extract , were rich , tasty , and nourishing . The long , slender , wild yams grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the sunlight warmed the fertile soil , were scatteredpatches of ti  --  a kind of dracaena , with a large root , very sweet when baked . Pia maohi , or wild arrowroot , indigenous to all the volcanic islands of the Pacific , was here , valuable for making the native puddings of which the white men soon grew fond . The coconuts would have been enough for ten times the population of the island . At the proper season , the cliffs provided the eggs and young of sea birds , the latter , when nearly full grown , being fat , tender , and far from ill-flavoured . Shellfish and crustaceans were to be gathered on the rocky shores when the weather wasp127calm , and fish abounded in the sea . Once their houses were built , and the land cleared for plantations of yams and clothplant , the mutineers found themselves able to live with littlelabour . There were two small Christians now  --  Thursday October and the baby , Charles ; McCoy was the father of a boy and a girl , and Sarah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population numbered twenty-six , now that Fasto was dead , and their island would have supported in comfort at least five hundred more . There had been little friction during the two years past , for the hard work together , the sense of sharing a common task , had bred good feeling betweenwhites and Polynesians . Now , as the second anniversary of their settlement on the island approached , all began to take life more easily . Minarii and Tetahiti spent much time at sea in the cutter , fishing for albacore ; certain of the white men took to loafing in the shade , while they forced the humbler natives to perform the daily tasks too heavy for womenfolk . Williams was seldom seen at the settlement , and McCoy , once the most sociable of men , was frequently absent from his house . No one knew where he spent so many hours each day , and none cared save Quintal , who grumbled incuriously at times when he wished to chat with his friend . Mary suspected that her husband was tired of her and had found consolation elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for he had been a trial to her since the daily grog ration had ceased ; his cuffs were far more frequentthan his caresses . With two small children to occupy her , Mary would have been content had her husband moved away for good . With the secretiveness of a Scot , and unknown to all the others , McCoy was conducting certain experiments in a narrowgorge on the unfrequented western slope of the island . In his youth he had been apprenticed to a distiller , and , while acquiring a rough knowledge of the distiller 's art , he had also acquired an inveterate love of alcohol . Unlike most British seamen of his day , McCoy cared little for sprees and jovial drinking bouts , and under ordinary circumstances never went to excess . What he loved was the certainty of an unfailing supply of grog , the glow and gentle relaxation of a quiet glass or two by himself . When the last of the Bounty 's rum was gone , save for the small amount preserved in case someone fell ill , McCoy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent and morose . The idea had come in a flash , one afternoon when he was alone at Williams 's forge . He was searching for a bit of wire , or a nail , to make a fishhook , and as he turned over the odds and ends of metal fetched from the ship he came on a few yards of copper tubing , coiled up and made fast with a bit of marline . A coil ! With a coil , cooled in water , it would be no trick at all to set up a small still ! Hiding the tubing carefully , he strolled home deep in thought . The copper pot from the ship would be the very thing , but it was at Christian 's house and not to be had without awkward explanations . There were a number of kettles which had been placed on board for trade with the Indians ; he had two of his own , but they were too small to make more than a pint a day ; yet a pint a day would be ample for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . He suspected that Christian would scent danger and put an immediate stop to it . He might let Matt Quintal in . . . . No , Quintal always went mad when enough grog was on hand . What could he use ? Sugar cane was not plentiful , and all of the people were fond of chewing it . He could never get enough without exciting suspicion . Why not ti ? The roots would have to be baked to make them sweet , then mashed in water and allowed to ferment . There was plenty of ti ; nearly everyone was heartily tired of it.  |p129Deliberately  , and with the greatest secrecy , McCoy went about his preparations . Musket on his arm , as if pig-hunting , he wandered about the island casually till he found a spot that suited him . Far off from Williams 's cottage , and below the upper slopes frequented by the increasing flock of goats , he found a narrow , walled-in gorge , where a trickle of water wandered down from the peak . Little by little , carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening , he accumulated what he needed there  --  a kettle , the coil , a supply of the roots , a native pestle of stone for mashingthem , and a keg in which to ferment the mash afterwards . Then , still without arousing curiosity , he fetched several bags of coconut shells , which burn with an intense and smokeless heat . The kettle was of cast iron , and held about two gallons . McCoy set it up carefully on three stones , inserted one end of his coil in the spout , and made the joint tight with a plaster of volcanic clay . He bent the flexible coil so that it passed into a large calabash sawed in half , and out , through a watertight joint , after a dozen turns . A dam of stones and mud across the watercourse formed a little pool , from which the cold water could be dipped to fill the calabash . When all was ready , he cooked a large earth oven of the roots , mashed them with his pestle on a flat rock , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The month was January , and the weather so hot that fermentation was not long delayed . When McCoy lifted the lid of his keg , thirty-six hours after the first stirring , a yeasty froth covered the mash . He stirred it once more , replacedthe lid , and strolled homeward , killing a fine yearling hog on the way . He was so obsessed with his plans , so eager to see and to taste the results of the experiment , that he scarcely closed his eyes all through the night . Long before the others were awake , he took up his musket and stole out , past Mary ,  | sleeping peacefully , with her two children at her side . The stars were bright overhead ; the day promised well . Striding along the starlit path , McCoy passed the house of Mills , passed Young 's house , and turned inland along the near bank of the ravine that led down from Brown 's Well . He halted for a moment to drink , where the rivulet ran into the upper end of the pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the small plateau above and toiled up to the summit of the Goat-House Ridge . Lack of breath forced him to rest for a moment here , where another man might have lingered to admire the wide prospect of land and sea . Beyond the sleeping settlement and the jagged peak of Ship-Landing Point , the sea stretched away , misty and indistinct in the morning calm . But in the east the sun announced its approach in a glory of colour among the low scattered clouds  --  blended gold and rose , shimmering like mother-of-pearl . McCoy shouldered his musket and took a dim goat-path leading down to the west . He found the mash working powerfully ; there was a rim of froth on the ground about the keg . He put a finger into the mess , tasted , and spat it out . Then , after a thorough stirring , he ladled the kettle full with half a coconut shell . Unwrapping his tinder carefully , he ignited the charred end with a stroke of flint on steel and blew up the dried leaves beneath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire of coconut shells was burning brightly . The lid of the kettle was of heavy cast iron , and fitted tightly , but McCoy now plastered it about with clay before he filled his sawn calabash with water and stood a pewter halfpinton a rock , where it would catch the drip from the coil . The kettle sang , and began to boil at last , while he poured more cool water over the coil from time to time . A drop formed at the end of the copper tube , grew visibly , and fell into the half-pint . Another drop formed and fell ; another and another , while the man watched with eager eyes.  |p131When  there was an inch or more of spirit in the pot , McCoy could wait no longer . He built up his fire , replenishedthe mash in the kettle , and substituted his half coconut shell for the pewter pot . Then , after ladling more cool water into the calabash , he seated himself with his back to a tree . He passed the half-pint under his nose , sniffing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " he muttered , and took a preliminary sip . McCoy made a wry face and swallowed violently . He opened his mouth wide and blew out his breath with all his force . " Ouf ! There ' s nae whiskey in Scotland can touch her for strength ! I 've tasted waur  --  het from the still , that is. , , He took a more substantial sip this time , coughed , sputtered , and rose to his feet . " It ' s water she needs just now . Gie her time ! Gie her time ! Ouf ! A glass o ' this ' d set old Matty daft ! " Mixed with a small measure of water , the spirit proved more palatable , though McCoy made many a wry face as he sipped . All through the morning he kept his fire goingand the kettle full , drinking the raw spirit as fast as it condensed in the coil . The sun was overhead when he allowed the fire to die out and stretched himself to sleep in the shade , with flushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the afternoon , and , though his head ached unmercifully , he made his way back to the settlement in deep content . McCoy 's supply of ti had been obtained from a natural glade not far inland from the house where Martin lived with Mills . The plant , more or less rare elsewhere on the island , grew in great plenty here , and at the suggestion of the natives the glade had not been set out to yams , though it lay close in and there was no clearing to be done . In the beginning both natives and whites had eaten the sweet baked roots with relish , but the ti proved cloying after a time and the plants were allowed to flourish undisturbed . Returning to his house in the cool of late afternoon , McCoy glanced through the scattered bush and perceived Martin in the distant glade , plying a mattock side by side with Hu . He left the path abruptly , and was surprised and displeased to see that they were grubbing up the roots of ti and casting them aside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked angrily . Martin halted in his work , and the native rested on his mattock-haft . " Get on with yer work , ye lazy lout ! " exclaimedMartin . " Did I tell ' ee to rest ? " He turned to McCoy . " What ' s that to you ? " " Damn yer eyes ! Ye ' re grubbing up all the ti ! " " It ' s no more yours than mine ! Who wants it , anyway ? I ' m going to make a yam patch here . " " I want it ! There ' s others on the island beside yersel ' ! Yams ? Ye 've the whole place to plant ' em on . " " Aye . And walk half a mile out to work . If ye ' d a musket ball in your leg like me , ye ' d think different . " McCoy controlled his temper with difficulty . " Listen , Isaac , " he said , " I 've a tooth for sweets ; not a day but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nae patch of ti on the island the like o ' this . Ye 've scarce made a start ; be a good lad and plant the yams elsewhere ! " After considerable persuasion , Martin agreed to leave the glade undisturbed . He summoned the native in a manner brutal and contemptuous , and led the way to the house , mumbling his discontent . McCoy picked up his musket and went home . Late the same evening he was reclining with Quintal on a mat spread before the doorstep . The women and childrenp133had gone into the house to sleep . McCoy had been broodingover his argument with Martin . Sooner or later , he feared , someone more intelligent than Martin might preemptthe ti patch , and put him in a position from which he would be unable to extricate himself without disclosing the secret of the still . " Matt , " he said , breaking a long silence , " did ' ee ever think o ' dividing the land ? We live like Indians here  --  sharing all hands alike ; it ai n't in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded . " When I clear a bit o ' land , " McCoy went on , " and put in yams , or plantains , or what not , I ' d like to think it ' s mine for good , and for little Sarah and Dan when I ' m underground . Ye ' ve young Matty to think on , and there ' 11 be more bairns coming along . " " Aye , " said Quintal , " I ' m with ' ee there . " " Let every man gang his ain gait ! If ye fancy yams , plant ' em for yersel ' . Gin it ' s taro ye want , though it ' s nae white man 's vivers to my mind , why , plant taro , and damn the rest ! That ' s a Scot 's way , and an Englishman 's too . " Slow in thought and with no gift of words , Quintal had a high opinion of McCoy 's sagacity . " Aye , Will , " he said , " the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spare , for the nine of us . We could make a common of the west end , for the goats . " " Nine , ye swad ! And the Indian men ? " Quintal grunted contemptuously . " Never mind them ! Give ' em land , ana they ' 11 not work for us . " McCoy gave his companion a quick glance . " Matti Ye ' re nae dowff as ye look ! Aye . . . there ' s summat in that . But we must no put their beards in a blaze ! " One morning , about a fortnight after Quintal 's talk with McCoy , Tararu was fishing from the rocks below Christian's house . The sea was calm , for this part of the coast was sheltered from the southerly swell . Tararu was the nephew of Minarii , and well born in Tahiti , though neither his person nor his character was such as was usual among the native aristocracy . He was of low stature and slight build , and there was more cunning than determinationin his face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that of men , he spent much of his time in solitary fishing excursions , which gave him an excuseto be absent when there was hard work to be done . The tuna-fishing offshore was too strenuous for his taste , and , though the others jeered at him for following a sport usually relegated to women , they were always glad to share his catch . He squatted on a weed-covered rock , beside a shallow pool left by the receding tide . The water was deep , close inshore , at this place . Tararu 's line was made of native flax , twisted on his naked thigh ; his barbless hook was of pearl shell , and his sinker a pear-shaped stone , pierced at its small end to allow the line to be made fast . He baited his hook with a bit of white meat from the tail of a crayfish , whirled the sinker about his head , and cast out . The coiled line flew from his left hand , the sinker plunged into the sea twenty yards away . He drew in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line taut from his stone , and squatted once more to wait for a bite . The birds were beginning to nest , and many hundreds of them came and went about their business over the calm sea . The morning was so still that he could hear , very faintly , the clink of Williams 's hammer at the forge , and the bleating of young goats on the ridge to the west . The sun was not yet high enough to be unpleasantly warm . Though his eyes were open , Tararu seemed to doze , as motionlessas the black rock beneath his feet , and scarcely more animate.  |p135But  he was on the alert when at last a fish seized his bait . He did not strike as a white fisherman would have done ; his incurved hook of pearl shell did not permit of that . Tararu kept a taut line , allowing the fish to run this way and that , while the hook turned and worked ever deeper into its jaw . It was a large , blue-spotted fish of the rock-cod kind , called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare prize . Presently , he swung it up out of the sea , disengaged the hook , and slid the fish into the pool beside him , where it sank to the bottom with heaving gills . Slowly and methodicallyhe baited his hook once more . The sun was high overhead and the pool well stocked with fish when Tararu coiled his line and laid it on a ledge above him to dry . The last wave but one had wet him to the ankles and streamed hissing into the pool . He opened his knife , and began to sharpen it on a flat pebble . The blade was half worn away by long use . " Tararu ! Tararu 0 ! " One of his countrymen was approaching , clambering down over the rocks . Tararu greeted him with a lift of the eyebrows , and held out his knife . " Look , " he said , pointing to the pool , " I have been lucky ! Clean and string them while I rest . " Hu was a small , humble , dark-skinned man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minarii . He grunted with pain and put a hand to his side as he stooped over the pool . " Are you hurt ? " asked Tararu . " Have you had a fall ? " " Not a fall , " replied the other , beginning to clean the first fish that came to hand . " Martin again . " " Did he beat you ? " " Aye . . . with a club . " " What had you done ? " Hu shook his head . " Done ? How can I say ? Nothing I do pleases him . We went together to the yam field . He sat in the shade and directed me at the work . The holes I dug were not deep enough , or too deep . I put in too many dead leaves when I filled them ; I cut up the seed yams too fine ! I am your man , and your uncle 's  --  not Martin 's slave ! I told him so ; then he beat me . " His hands trembled as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anger . " What can I do ? Will you not protect me , you or Minarii ? " Tararu reflected for some time with downcast eyes . " There is only one way , " he said at last . " I dare not stir Minarii too deeply , for if trouble comes with the whites , they will take their muskets and shoot us all . Kill Martin ! Kill him in a way that none will suspect . " " Mea au roa ! " exclaimed Hu , looking up from his task with gleaming eyes . " But how is it to be done ? " Tararu leaned over the pool , fumbled among the fish remainingthere , and drew forth an odd creature , about a foot long , with a small mouth and a strange square body , checkeredin black and white . " With this ! " he said . " A hue'hue , " remarked the other . " I have heard that there is poison in them . " " The flesh is sweet and wholesome if the gall bladder is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no strong taste , yet four drops of it will kill a man . Squeeze out the bladder on a bit of yam or on a pudding . He will be dead before the setting of the sun . " Hu shook his head . " Leave poisoning to wizards and old women . Not even Martin could I kill in that way ! " Tararu shrugged his shoulders , and the other went on : " But it might be done on the cliffs . He has ordered me to go with him to the Rope this afternoon . The birds are beginning to lay . " When the fish were cleaned and scaled , Hu shouldered the heavy string and followed Tararu in the stiff climb to the plateau.  |p137Toward  mid-afternoon , Martin and Smith sauntered down the path to the house of the natives . They carried egging baskets and coils of rope , and found Hu waiting to accompanythem . Smith led the way to the ridge , and a short walk brought them to the verge of the cliffs hemming in the little half-moon bay . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swell , and the thunder of the breakers came up faintly from far below . Sea birds in thousands sailed back and forth along the face of the cliff . Smith peered over the brink and dropped the coil of twoinchline from his shoulder . Making fast one end to the trunk of a stout pandanus tree , he tossed the coils over the cliff , slung his basket about his neck , and began to reconnoitrethe ground . There were many nests in the scrub pandanusbushes that stood out almost horizontally from the wall of rock . Birds sat in some of them ; in others , deserted temporarily during the heat of the day , he perceived the clutches of eggs . Martin was making fast his rope at a place about thirty yards away . It was his custom to take one of the natives on these egging excursions , to perform the task he had no stomach for . Smith gripped the rope with both hands and scrambled over the brink of the cliff , pressing the soles of his bare feet against the rock . Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet below , where he could rest at ease , and where he had spied two well-filled nests within reach . He had transferred the eggs to his basket when the sounds of a scuffle and angry shouting reached his ears . Smith listenedfor a moment , set his lips , and began to climb the ropes rapidly , hand over hand , aiding himself with his feet . At the summit , he set down his basket before he rose from his knees . Then , half running through the scrub , he made for the sound of Martin 's angry voice . " Kill me , would ' ee ? Take that , ye Indian bastard ! And that , God damn ' ee ! "  |p138Martin  stood over the bloody and prostrate form of Hu , kicking him savagely at each exclamation . He swung about as he felt Smith 's hand on his shoulder , and said , still shouting : " The bastard ! Tried to rush me over the cliff , he did ! " He made as if to kick the native once more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Avast , Isaac ! " ordered Smith , and then , glancing down , he asked : " Is this true ? " " Aye , " groaned the prostrate man , who could scarcely speak , " it is true . " Martin wrenched himself free and aimed another kick at Hu . Smith sprang on him and pulled him back roughly . " I ' 11 not stand by and see the like o ' this ! " he exclaimed . " Damn your blood , Alex ! " said Martin angrily . " I tell ' ee , he tried to push me over the cliff ! " " D ' ye think I ' m blind , man ? Ye ' ve given him cause , and to spare ! " Anger got the better of Martin 's customary caution . Smith had released him , and now stood between him and the native , who was rising painfully to his feet . Martin clenched his fists . " This is my lay ! Stand by ! Or d ' ye want a clout on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insane rage in his eyes , he sprang forward and struck Smith a heavy blow . The smaller man grunted without flinching , put up his hands , and lowered his head . The fight was over in two minutes ; Martin lay on the ground with a bruised jaw and breathing heavily through his nose . When he sat up dazedly at last , Smith spoke . " We ' 11 say no more of this . . . . It ' s best so . Mind what I say , Isaac , it ' 11 go hard with ye if I catch ye bullying this man again . And Hu ,  --  though I ca n't say I blame ye much ,  --  remember , no more such murderin ' tricks ! " He touched his lips . " Mainu ' s the word ! "  |p139IT  was a calm night in February 1792 ; the sky was cloudlessand the rising moon low over the sea . The natives had supped and were reclining on the grass before their house , gossiping in subdued voices , broken by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence , hands behind his head . Tararu stood alone at some little distance , gazing up the moonlit path . Though they spoke lightly of other things , one thought was in every mind , for Hutia had not returned . In their love of decorum , the Polynesians resemble the Chinese ; to their minds , an action is often less important than the manner in which it is performed , and the appearance of virtue more so than virtue itself . Like the others , Tararu had long known where the girl spent so many hours each day , but hitherto she had conducted her affairs with discretion , taking care to put no affront upon her husband 's dignity . Now at last the persuasions of Williams had overcomeher fear of a scene . Turning his head slightly Minarii perceived that Tararu was gone . He sat up , seemed to reflectfor a moment , and lay down once more , his lips set in a thin , stern line . The moon was well up when Tararu emerged from a thicket near the lonely cottage of Williams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open door and listened for a moment before he peered into the house . His wife was asleep on a mat just inside , her head pillowed on the blacksmith 's brawny arm . For an instant , passion overcame his fear of Williams ; had he carried a weapon , he would have killed the blacksmith as he lay . Hutia 's small naked foot was close to the door , and Tararu stretched out a shaking hand to rouse her . At first she only murmured incoherently in her sleep , but when he had nearly pulled her off the mat , she opened her eyes . " Come outside ! " he whispered fiercely . Williams sat up . " What do you want ? " he growled . " My woman ! " exclaimed Tararu , in a voice that broke with anger . " My woman , you white dog ! " The blacksmith sprang to his feet . His fists were clenched and his short black beard bristled within an inch of Tararu 's chin . " She ' s my woman now ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menacing , that the native cast down his eyes , but his sense of dignity would not permit him to turn away quickly enough to please the other man . As he turned slowly , trembling with anger and humiliation , a kick delivered with all the strength of the blacksmith 's sturdy leg sent him sprawling on all fours . He rose with some difficulty while Williams stood over him . " Now will you go ? " he asked truculently . Tararu clenched his teeth and limped away up the moonlitslope . Though the others had gone into the house to sleep , Minarii still lay outside , wide awake , when Tararu returned . He sat up to listen impassively to a torrent of whispered words , and when the other fell silent his reply was a grunt of contempt . " You call yourself a man , " he remarked after a short pause , " and come to me with tiis woman 's tale ! Atira ! If you want the woman , rouse her and fetch her home . " Tararu hesitated . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the better of him , and he went on incoherently : " My words roused Williams  --  he kicked me and knocked me down ! " Minarii 's deep voice interrupted him . " Were you not myp141sister 's son . . . " He rose , with an expression of stern displeasureon his face . " Tihe ! To think that I should take a hand in such affairs ! Wait for me here ; perhaps soft words will right the wrong . If not . . . " He shrugged his great shoulders as he turned away . The night was warm and Alexander Smith was working in the little garden before his house . Young and Taurua had gone early to bed ; Balhadi had been helping her man to water some ferns planted the day before , but drowsiness had overcomeher , and she too had retired . The moon was so bright that Smith watered and raked and weeded as if it had been day . It was late when he stopped and sat down on the rustic bench by the path . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long siesta in the afternoon had left him with no desire to sleep . The moon was nearly at the zenith when he raised his head at the sound of a step on the path . It was Minarii , and Hutia walked behind him , bowed and sobbing . He halted at sight of Smith . " It is fortunate that you are awake , Alex , " he said . " There is trouble  --  trouble that may lead to graver things . " He went on to recount the happenings of the night . " Where is Williams ? " Smith asked . " On the floor of his house , " replied Minarii grimly . " He fought like a man . . . . Look ! " He pointed to a great black bruise on his jaw . Smith thought for a moment before he spoke . " We must act quickly . Only Christian can handle this . Stop here while I rouse him . " When he was gone , Minarii seated himself with his back to a hibiscus tree and the girl crouched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grip that made her wince . Concealed in the deep shadow of the tree , they watched the blacksmith move down the path toward the house of Mills.  |p142Williams  was in no mood for half-measures . He limped painfully , and halted from time to time to spit out a mouthful of blood . When he had wakened Mills , they walked side by side to the house of McCoy . " Damn him , he was too much for me ! " said the blacksmith , thickly . " Had you or Matt been there , we ' d have murdered him ! " Mills grunted sympathetically . " Here we are , " he remarked . " I ' 11 go in and fetch ' em . " A moment later he came out with McCoy and Quintal , rubbing the sleep from their eyes . They listened attentivelyto what the blacksmith had to say . " Where are they now ? " asked Quintal . " At the Indian house , I reckon . " McCoy smiled sourly . " This ' 11 mean a fight . Curse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sabbaths to boot ; must ye stir up the whole island because ye can nae sleep wi ' her nights ? " Williams turned away angrily . " Then stop where ye are . Come along ! " he said to Mills . " We ' 11 fetch the muskets . " " Ne'er fash yersel ' , Jack , " put in McCoy . " We ' 11 help ye fast enough , but it ' s an unchancy business for all that ! " " We ' d best get it over with , " said Mills . " Teach the bloody Indians their place . . . . Who ' s this ? " Christian was striding rapidly down the moonlit path , followed by Smith and Minarii . Hutia brought up the rear , half trotting to keep pace with the men . She longed to slip into the bush and escape , but dared not . Williams moved forward truculently when he perceived Minarii , only to fall back at sight of Christian 's face . " What is all this ? " Christian asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up my mind last night , sir , " Williams replied with a mingling of defiance and respect . " I told my girl to stopp143with me and leave her Indian for good . He came to fetch her when we were asleep . I woke and kicked him out . Then Minarii came . " He drew a deep breath and spat out a mouthful of blood . " He was too much for me . When I came round , he was gone and my girl with him . What could I do but make haste down to the settlement and fetch the others to lend a hand ? " Minarii stood with head high and arms folded on his bare chest . His face was impassive and sternly set . Christian turned to him . " Shall I tell you what Williams says ? " " He has not lied . " Christian glanced down distastefully at Hutia , cowering on the grass with her head in her arms . " Is the peace of this land to be broken because of a loose girl and two men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Minarii . " On that point we see alike . But I can not stand by while my sister 's son is shamed before all , and cursed and kicked by a commoner , even though he be white . " " Then fetch Tararu . He must come at once . " As Minarii walked toward the natives ' house , Christian turned to the four mutineers . " I ' m going to settle this matter here and now ! " he said . " We have had more than enough of it . The woman shall choose the man she wishes to live with , and there is to be no murmuring afterward . Let that be understood . " " I ' m with ye , Mr. Christian ! " exclaimed McCoy . " Aye , " muttered Quintal . " That ' s the way to settle it . " When Minarii returned , followed by his nephew , Christian spoke once more . " Tararu , " he said , " stand forth ! The woman shall choose between you . And let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Williams , " he went on . " Minarii , tell her that she is to make her choice and abide by it . " The girl was still crouched on the grass , face hidden in her  | arms . Minarii spoke to her in a harsh voice before he pulled her roughly to her feet . With eyes cast down , but without a moment of hesitation , she walked to the blacksmith and linked her arm in his . Autumn came on with strong winds from the west , and fine rains that drizzled down for days together . In early April the weather turned so cold that the people spent much of the time in their houses . Situated more than seven degrees of latitude to the south of Tahiti , Pitcairn 's Island lay in the region of variable westerly winds , and its climate was far colder and more invigorating than that of the languorous isles to the north . One night in April , the wind shifted from west to southwestand blew the sky clear . While the stars twinkled frostily , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , half wakening to pull additional blankets of tapa up to their chins . Mills and Prudence slept in the room upstairs , on a great standing bed-place filled with sweet fern and covered with many layers of soft bark cloth . Prudence lay on her side , her unbound hair half covering the pillow , and one arm thrown protectingly over the tiny child who slumbered betweenher and the wall . Presently the open window on the east side of the room became a square of grey in the dawn . The old red cock from Tahiti , roosting in the tapou tree , wakened , clapped his wings loudly , and raised his voice in a long-drawn challenging crow . Prudence stirred and opened her eyes . The baby was already awake , staring up gravely at the thatch . The young mother roused herself , leaned over to sniff fondly at the child 's head , on which a copper-red down was beginning to appear , and sat up , shivering . Taking care not to waken Mills , she threw a sheet of tapa over her shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sleeping man.  |p14SWith  her baby on one arm , the girl climbed nimbly down the ladder , crossed the room where Martin snored beside Susannah , opened the door softly , and went out . It was broad daylight now and the glow of sunrise was in the east . Save for mare's-tails of filmy cloud , the sky was clear ; the trees swayed as the strong southwest wind hummed through their tops . Prudence drew a long breath and threw back her head to shake the heavy hair over her shoulders . In the maturity of young motherhood , she was among the handsomest of the women . Her brown eyes were set wide apart under slender , arched brows ; though small , her figure was perfectly proportioned ; her beautiful hair , of the strange copper color to be found occasionally among Maoris of unmixedblood , fell rippling to her knees . Her race was the lightest-skinned of all brown folk , and the chill , damp winds of Pitcairn 's Isle had brought the glow of young blood to her cheeks . Mills was deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been happy with the dour old seaman since the birth of their child . Eliza raised her voice in a wail and Prudence smiled down at her as she walked to the outdoor kitchen . " There ! " she said , as she deposited the baby in a rude cradle Mills had made , and tucked her in carefully . " Lie still ! You shall have your meal presently . " As if she understood , the child ceased to cry and watched her mother gravely as she struck a spark to her tinder and blew up the flame among some chips of wood . When the fire was burning well , Prudence filled the pot from the barrel of rain water and set it on to boil . She took up Eliza , seated herself on the stool used for grating coconuts , and teased the child for a moment with her breast , offered and withdrawn . Soon the baby was suckling greedily ; after a time , before the kettle had boiled , her eyelids began to droop , and presently her mother rose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Prudence now took some eggs and half a dozen plantains from a basket hanging out of reach of rats , and dropped them into the boiling water . From another basket she took a breadfruit , cooked the day before . She heard Mills at the water barrel , washing his face , and turned to greet him as he appeared at the kitchen door . He stooped over the cradle and touched the sleeping baby 's head with a stubby thumb . " Liza , little lass , " he said , " ye 've a soft life , eh ? Naught but eat and sleep . " Prudence set food before him , and stood leaning on the table as he fell to heartily . " I am hungry for fresh meat , " she said . " See , the weather has changed . Take your musket and kill a hog for us . " Mills swallowed half of an egg and took a sup of water before he replied . " Aye , that I will , lass . Fire up the oven , for I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these days . " When he was gone and she had eaten her light breakfast of fruits , she spread a mat in the shelter of the banyan tree by the forge , and fetched her sleeping child and an uncompletedhat she was weaving for Mills . Susannah was stirring in the kitchen , but Martin would not be on foot for another hour or two . Prudence glanced up from her work at the sound of a footstep and saw Tararu approaching , an axe on his shoulder . She had scarcely laid eyes on him since the trouble with Williams ; he had ceased his former gossiping and flirtatious way with the women , and spent most of his time in the bush . He caught her eye and made an attempt to smile . Polynesian etiquette demanded that some word be spoken , and he asked , in a hoarse voice : " Where is Mills ? " " Gone pig-hunting , " she replied . The Bounty 's grindstone stood close by , near the forge . Tararu took the calabash from its hook , filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a thin trickle fell on the stone . Picking up his axe , he set to work . Prudence bent over herp147plaiting , glancing at the man from time to time out of the corner of her eye . He ground on steadily , first one side of the blade and then the other , halting occasionally to test the edge with his thumb . An hour passed . Something in Tararu 's manner , and in the meticulous care with which he worked , struck the girl as out of the ordinary . He was a lazy , shiftless fellow as a rule . " Never have I seen an axe so sharpened ! " she remarked . He grunted , intent on his task , and she went on : " What is your purpose ? " He looked up and hesitated for a moment before he replied . " I have been clearing a field for yams . Yesterday I found a purau tree , tall , straight , and thick . To-morrow I shall fell it , and begin to shape a canoe . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind was busy . Canoe-building was practised in Tahiti only by a guild of carpenters called tahu'a , which included men of all classes , even high chiefs . Minarii was an adept , but Tararu knew no more of the art than a child of ten . Yet why should he lie to her ? After a long time the axe was sharpened to Tararu 's satis faction , bright and razor-edged . He shouldered it , gave Prudence a surly nod , and walked away into the bush . The girl took up her child , gathered her work together absently , and went into the house , deep in thought . When she reappeared , a mantle of tapa was thrown over her shoulders , and she carried her child , warmly wrapped against the wind , on one arm . She had plaited her hair in two long , thick braids , twisted them around her head , and pinned them in place with skewers of bamboo . Walking with the light and resilient step of youth , she took the path that led past Smith 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summit of the Goat-House Ridge . Half an hour later , she was approachingWilliams 's lonely cottage . At some distance from the door she halted and gave the melodious little cry with which a Polynesian visitor announced his presence to the inmates of a house . Hutia appeared at the door and greeted the other without a smile . " Where is your man ? " asked Prudence . " At work in the bush . " " Hutia , " said the younger girl earnestly , coming close to her old enemy , " you and I have not been friends , but should anything happen to Williams , my man would never cease his mourning , for the two are like brothers . " " Come into the house , " Hutia said , her manner changing . " The wind is over cold for aiu . " She took the baby from the younger girl 's arms and covered the little face with kisses before she closed the door . " Now tell me what is in your mind , " she went on . Prudence recounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had replied to her question , and her own suspicions . The other girl 's expression turned grave . " Aye , " she said at last , " I fear you are right . He is a coward at heart and will come by night if he comes . " " So I think , " replied Prudence . " Who knows ? I may be wrong , but you will do well to warn your man . " " Guard him , rather ; I shall tell him nothing . He would only mock me for a woman 's fears . If I convinced him of danger , he would go in search of Tararu , bringing on more trouble with Minarii . No . We have two muskets here . I can shoot as straight as any man ! " Prudence stood up after a time and took her child . " I must return to light the oven , " she remarked . " Mills has gone to shoot a pig . " " Let us be friends from now on , " said Hutia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little land . " When the young mother was gone , Hutia set about her household tasks , and greeted Williams with her usual cheerful and casual manner at dinner time . But when he had suppedp149that evening , and stretched himself out , dead-tired , she waited only until certain that he was in a sound sleep before making her preparations . In the light of a taper of candlenuts , smoking and sputtering by the wall , she loaded the two muskets , measuring the powder with great care , wadding it with bits of tapa , and ramming the bullets home with patches of the same material , greased with lard . The last skewered nut was ablaze when the task was finished , giving her time to see to the priming and wipe the flints carefully before the light flickered and winked out . With a heavy musket in each hand she stepped softly across the room and out into the starlit night . Like many of the women , Hutia understoodfirearms thoroughly . The house had only one door . Shivering a little in the chill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one musket across her knees , the other standing close at hand . Even in the dim starlight , no one would be able to leave or enter the house unperceived , and she knew that two hours from now she could count on the light of the waning moon . A long time passed while the girl sat alert and motionless . At last the sky above the ridge began to brighten and presently the moon rose , in a cloudless sky , over the wooded mountain . The shadow of the house took form sharply ; the clearing was flooded with cold silvery light , bounded by the dark wall of the bush . It was nearly midnight when Hutia turned her head suddenly . Pale and unsubstantial in the moonlight , the shadowy figure of a man was moving across the cleared land . The girl cocked her musket as she rose . Tararu approached the cottage slowly and softly . When he was within a dozen yards of her , Hutia stepped out into the moonlight . " Faaea ! " she ordered firmly , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endeavoured to conceal his axe behind him . " Come no closer , " she went on , " and make no sound . If you waken Williams he will kill you . I know why you are here . "  | Tararu began to mumble some whispered protestation of innocence , but she cut him short , scornfully . " Waste no words ! It is in my mind to shoot you as you stand . " Hutia 's hands were shaking a little with anger . Her former husband was only too well aware of her high temper and determined recklessness when roused . With a suddennessthat took her aback , he sprang to one side and bounded away across the clearing , axe in hand . She raised the musket and took aim between his shoulders . For five seconds or more she stood thus , her finger on the trigger she could not bring herself to pull . She lowered the weapon , watched the runner disappear into the bush , and turned toward the cottage . When Williams rose next morning , he found Hutia up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ye ' ve a weary look , lass , " he remarked . " Sleep badly ? " " Aye  --  I had bad dreams . " She looked up from her work . " The sea is calming down . I shall go fishing this morning , in the lee . " The blacksmith nodded . " Good luck to ye . I could do with a mess of fish ! " Toward noon of the same day , Tararu was at work on a small clearing in the Aute Valley . None of the men , save Martin perhaps , had a deeper dislike of work ; his chief object in clearing the little yam field was to be alone . He was beginning to hate the house of the natives , where he now spent as little as possible of his time . Their ideas of courtesy preventedan open display of contempt , but Minarii treated him coldly , and he could not face the disapproval in Tetahiti 's eye . The morning was cool , and he plied his axe with more diligence than usual . Tararu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a purau tree at the edge of the clearing , and he was working at some distance , unaware that he was not alone . Peepingp151through a screen of leaves , Hutia had reconnoitred the cleared land and was now approaching the basket cautiously , unseen and making no sound . She glanced at the man , whose back was turned to her , reached into the basket , took out a large baked fish , done up in leaves , and unwrapped it , crouching out of sight . Glancing up warily once more , she squeezed something which had the appearance of a few drops of water into the inside of the fish , holding it carefully to give the liquid time to soak in . A moment later the fish was wrapped up and returned to the basket , and Hutia disappeared , as quietly as she had come . Ten minutes had passed when Tararu glanced up at the sun and dropped his axe . As he strolled across to where his basket hung , he heard a cheerful hail and saw Hu . " You ' ve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is well . I ' ve brought you some baked plantains ; the women said you had none . " " Fetch a banana leaf to spread the food on , and you shall share my meal . " The servant was the only one of his countrymen whose manner toward him had not changed ; Tararu was grateful for the little attention and glad of his company . They ate with good appetites , gossiping of island trivialities , and when the last of the food was gone both men lay down to sleep.  |p152ONE  afternoon Christian was trudging up the path that led to the Goat-House Ridge . Toiling to the summit , he left the path and turned north along the ridge , to make his way around to the seaward slope of the peak . His path was the merest cranny in the rock , scarcely affording foothold , but he trod the ledge with scarcely a downward glance . Deeply rooted in the rock ahead of him , two ironwood trees spread gnarled limbs that had withstood the gales of more than a century ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way other than Christian 's dizzy track . Reaching the trees , he lowered himself between the roots to a broad ledge below and entered a cave . It was a snug little place , well screened by drooping casuarina boughs  --  ten or twelve feet in depth , and lofty enough for a tall man to stand upright . Half a dozen muskets , well cleaned and oiled , stood against the further wall ; there was a keg of powder , a supply of bullets , and two large calabashes holding several gallons of water . The cave was a small fortress , where a single resolute man might have held an army at bay so long as he had powder and lead . It was here that Christian spent an hour when he wished to be alone , lost in sombre reflections as he gazed out over the vast panorama of lonely sea and listened to the booming of the surf many hundreds of feet below . For the situation of the mutineers and the native men and women with them he felt a deep and tragic sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had realized that soonerp153or later their refuge was certain to be discovered . He had resolved not to be taken alive when that day came . Christian now took up his muskets , one after the other , and concealed them with his powder and ball among the roots of the further ironwood tree . When nothing but the calabashes of water remained in the cave , he made his way back to the ridge and took the path to the settlement , walking rapidly . He found Maimiti with her baby , Charles , seated on a mat in the shade of a wild hibiscus tree . Nanai , the wife of Tetahiti , was beside her . Thursday October Christian , a sturdy boy of two , had trotted down the path to Young 's house , where he spent much of his time with Balhadi and Taurua , childless women who loved the small boy dearly . " Come with me , " said Christian to his wife . " There is something I wish to show you . You ' 11 look after the baby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ? " Maimiti asked . " Till sunset , perhaps . " She followed her husband up the trail to the ridge and along the breakneck path to the ironwood trees . When he lowered himself to the ledge before the cave and held up his arms for her , she gave an exclamation of surprise . " AN ! No one knows of this place ! " " Nor shall they , save you . I want no visitors here ! " He seated himself on the ledge , with his back to the wall of rock , while Maimiti examined the cave with interest . Presently she sat down beside him and they were silent for a time , under a spell of beauty and loneliness . Sea birds hovered and circled along the face of the cliff below , the upper surfaces of their wings glinting in the sun and their cries faintly heard above the breakers . The wind droned shrilly through the foliage of the ironwood trees , thin , harsh , and prickly . At length Christian spoke . " Maimiti , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in case of need . I love this place . Sometimes , in its peace and solitude , I seem to be close to those I love in England . " " Where is England ? " she asked . He pointed in a northeasterly direction , out over the sea . " There ! Across two great oceans and a vast island peopled by savage men . Such an island as your people never dreamed of , so wide that if you were to walk from morning till night each day it would take three moons to cross ! " " A/lea atea roa ! " she said wonderingly . " And Tahiti  --  where is my island ? " " Yonder , " replied Christian , pointing to the northwest . " Are you no longer homesick ? Are you happy here ? " " Where you are , my home is , and I am happy . This is agood land . " " Aye , that it is . " He glanced down at her affectionately . " The cool weather is wholesome . Your cheeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Never have I seen boys stronger and better grown than ours . " " All the children are the same . And since we came here not a man or a woman has been ill . Were not some of the fish poisonous , our island would be like your Rohutu Noanoa , a paradise . " " Do you believe that Hu and Tararu died of eating a fish ? " He turned his head quickly . " What do you mean ? " he asked . " Surely they died of poisoning ; they were known to have eaten a large fish declared to be poisonous in Tahiti . " " The faaroa is harmless here ; I have eaten many of them . " " What do you mean ? " he repeated , in a puzzled voice . She hesitated , and then said : " It was whispered to us by one who should know . The others suspect nothing . What if Tararu hated Williams more bitterly than we supposed ? What if he sharpened an axe expressly to kill him by night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door ? I think she made it her business to poison Tararu 's dinner , and that Hu partook of the food by chance ! " Christian knew that suspicion was foreign to Maimiti 's nature , and the seriousness of her words made him look up in astonishment . " But have your people poisons so subtle and deadly ? " he asked . " Aye , many of them , though they are not known to all . Hutia 's father was a sorcerer in Papara , an evil man , often employed by the chiefs to do their enemies to death . The commoners believe that such work is accomplished by incantations ; we know that poison is administered before the incantations begin . " Christian remained silent , and she went on , after a pause : " The others suspect nothing , as I said . " He sighed and raised his head as if dismissing unpleasant thoughts from his mind . " It is ended , " he said , rising to his feet . " Let us speak no more of this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bounty at Pitcairn , and the little settlement presented the appearance of an ordered and permanent community . The dwellings had lost their look of newness and now harmonized with the landscape as if they had sprung from the soil . Each house was surrounded by a neat fence enclosing a small garden of ferns and shrubbery , and provided with an outdoor kitchen , a pigsty at a little distance , and an enclosure for fattening fowls . As in Tahiti , it was the duty of the women to keep the little gardens free of weeds , and to sweep the paths each day . Winding picturesquely among the trees , well-worn trails led to the Goat-House , to the western slope where Williams lived , to the Aute Valley where the principal gardens of the cloth-plant had been laid out , to the yam and sweet-potato patches and plantain walks , to the rock cisterns Christian had insisted on building in case of drought , to the Rope , and to the saw pit , still used occasionally when someone was in need of plank . The smithy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looked as if it had been in use for many years . The vice and anvil bore the marks of long service ; the bellows had been mended with goatskin , to which patches of hair still clung ; there was a great pile of coconut shells close to the forge , and another of charcoal made from the wood of the made . The ground underfoot was black with cinders for many yards about . The life of the mutineers had become easy , too easy for the good of some . Quintal , Martin , and Mills had taken to loafing about their houses , forcing most of their work on Te Moa and Nihau . Happy with the girl who had given him so much trouble in the past , Williams saw little of his friends . Smith and Young worked daily , clearing , planting , or fishing for the mere pleasure of the task . For more than a year McCoy had kept the secret of the still . Only a Scot could have done it , one gifted with all the caution and canny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhausted the principal supplies of ti , and for many months now he had been able to obtain no more than enough to operate his still twice or , rarely , three times each week . A small stock of bottles , accumulated one by one , were hidden where he concealed the still when not in use ; by stinting himselfresolutely , he managed to keep a few quarts of his liquor set aside to age . In this manner , which had required for some time a truly heroic abstinence , McCoy was enabled to enjoy daily a seaman 's ration of half a pint of grog . His temperament was an unusual one , even among alcoholics . When deprived of spirits , he became gloomy , morose , and irritable , but a glass or two of rum was sufficient to make him the most genial of men . Mary had been astonishedand delighted at the change in him . He conversedp157with her for an hour or more each evening , laughing and joking in the manner the Polynesians love . He romped with two-year-old Sarah and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dan . With his grog ration assured , there was no better father and husband on the island than McCoy . He longed to ' make a plantation of ti , but decided after much thought that the risk was too great . Explanations would be lame at best , and the sharper-witted among his comrades would be certain to suspect the truth . Meanwhile , he realized with a pang that the island produced only a limited supply of the roots , bound to be exhausted in time . Even now , fourteen months of distilling had so diminished the ti that McCoy 's cautious search for the roots , scattered here and there in the bush , occupied most of his waking hours . He took the work with intense seriousness , and though by nature a kindly man , not inconsiderate of others , he now joined heartily with Quintal in forcing Te Moa to perform their daily tasks in the plantations and about the house . If the native was remiss in weeding a yam patch or chopping firewood , McCoy joined his curses to Quintal 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the condition of a slave . After Hu 's death , Martin had similarly enslaved Nihau , and Mills , seeing that his neighbours were comfortable in the possession of a servant who did nearly all their work , soon fell into the same frame of mind . The natives resented their new status deeply , but so far had not broken out in open revolt . On a morning in late summer , McCoy set out on one of his cautious prowls through the bush . He took care to avoid the clearings where others might be at work , and carried only a bush knife and a bag of netting for the roots . Making for a tract of virgin bush at the western extremity of the Main Valley , where he had formerly spied several plants which should be mature by now , he was surprised and displeased , toward eight o'clock , to hear the strokes of a woodsman 's axe not far ahead . He concealed his bag , which contained three or four smallish roots , and moved forward quietly , knife in hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ axeman who loved the work . He was felling a tall candlenut tree , and each resounding stroke bit deep into the soft wood . Warned by a slight premonitory crackle of rending fibres and the swaying of branches overhead , he stepped back a pace or two . A louder crackling followed ; slowly and majestically at first , and then with a rushing progress through the air , the tree which had weathered the gales of many years succumbed to the axe . McCoy had just time to spring aside nimbly as it crashed to earth . " Who is that ? " called Tetahiti , in dismay . " It is I , McCoy . " " Had I known you were there . . . " McCoy interrupted him . " Eita e peapea ! It was my fault for approaching unannounced . " He was irritated , but not on account of the tree . " What are you doing here ? " he asked . The native smiled . " You have heard the men of Tahiti call me " Tupuai taro-eater . ' We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never have enough , so I am clearing this place , where the soil is rich and moist . " " Aye , " said McCoy sourly , as he caught sight of several splendid ti plants hitherto concealed by the bush , " the soil is good . " Tetahiti pointed to where he had thrown together several roots larger than any McCoy had seen . " Where the ti flourishes as here , taro will do well . " Seeing the other stoop to examine the roots with some show of interest , he went on : " These are the best kinds ; the ti-vai-raau , largest of all , and the mateni , sweetest and easiest to crush . " " Are you fond of it ? "  | " No , its sweetness sickens me . But I thought I would fetch in a root for Christian 's children . " " Then give me the rest . " The native assented willingly , and before long McCoy was trudging over the ridge and down toward his still , bent under a burden far heavier than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared a ground oven to bake the roots . It was late afternoon when he returned to the house . He found Quintal alone , sitting on the doorstep with his chin in his hands . His expression was morose , and he seemed to be thinking , always a slow and painful process with him . " What ' s wrong , Matt ? " asked McCoy . " The Indians , damn their blood ! " " What ha ' they done ? " " It ' s Minarii . . . . I ' d a mind to put Te Moa to work on my valley  --  ye know the place , a likely spot for the cloth-plant . I took a stroll up that way and found Minarii clearing the bush . Chop down as many trees as ye like , ' said I , but mind ye , this valley is mine ! ' He looked at me cheeky as a sergeant of marines . Yours ? ' he says . Yours ? The land belongs to all ! ' " Did ye put him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There ' d been bloodshed if I had . " " Aye , he ' s a dour loon . " " We was close enough to a fight ! It was the thought of Christian stopped me ; I want him on my side when the trouble comes . " McCoy nodded slowly . " Ye did right ; it ' s a fashious business , but we ' 11 ha ' peace gin we divide the land . " " How ' 11 we go about it ? " " We 've the right to a show of hands . I 'll see Jack Williams , and Isaac , and Mills ; we ' 11 be five against the other four . Then we ' 11 go to Christian . "   Quintal brought his huge hand down resoundingly on his knee . " Ye ' ve a level head ! Aye , let every Englishman have his farm , and be damned to the rest ! " " Ilka cock fight his ain battle , eh ? " said McCoy , with a complacent grin . Late the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cove . He had been fishing offshore since noon , and carried easily , hanging from the stout pole on his shoulder , nearly two hundredweight of albacore . At the summit of the bluff he set down his burden with a grunt and seated himself on a boulder to rest for a moment . He glanced up at the sound of a step on the path , and saw that Te Moa was approaching at a rapid walk . " I was hastening down to help you , " said the man apologetically . " Let us stop here while I rest , " Tetahiti replied ; " then you can carry my fish to the house . There is enough for all . " " I must speak ! " said Te Moa after a short silence . " I can endure no more ! " " Are the white men mistreating you again ? " " They take me for a dog ! Quintal sits in his house all day , like a great chief . McCoy is always away in the hills ; I think he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning I did not dislike these men ; I shared their food as they shared in the work , and McCoy smiled when he spoke , but they are changed , and little by little I have become a slave . Have you noticed Quintal 's eyes ? I fear him  --  I believe he is going mad . " " Aye , I have seen him on his doorstep , talking to himself . " " ' What can I do ? If I displease him , he beats me , both he and McCoy . " Tetahiti flushed . " They are dogs , beneath a chief 's contempt ! Let them work for themselves . Cease going to their house . "   " I fear Quintal . He will come and fetch me . " " Let him try ! " Tetahiti 's deep voice was threatening . " I will deal with him . We have been patient , hoping to avoid bad blood . Once he affronts you in public , Christian will put an end to all this . " He rose and helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Half an hour later , stopping at Quintal 's house to give Sarah a cut of albacore , Te Moa found the women alone . " They are gone to Christian 's , " Mary explained , " on some business that concerns them all . Best wait till morning to distribute your fish . " The sun had set , and in the twilight , already beginning to lengthen with the approach of spring , the mutineers were seated on the plot of grass before Christian 's house . He and Young sat on a bench facing the men . Williams was the last to arrive . The hum of talk ceased as McCoy rose to his feet . " Mr. Christian , " he said , " there ' s a question come up that ' s nae to be dismissed lightly . Ye ' ve bairns , sir , as have I , and John Mills , and Matt Quintal here . We 've them to think on , and the days to come . A man works best on his ain land . The time ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , giving each his share . " Christian nodded . " Quite right , McCoy ! " he said heartily . " Mr. Young and I were speaking of the same thing only last week . As you say , a man works with more pleasure when the land is his , and the division will leave no grounds for dispute after we are dead . The island can be divided so that each will have a fair share ; I have already given the matter some thought . A show of hands is scarcely necessary . Are there any who disagree ? " " Not I , sir ! " said Alexander Smith , and there was a chorus : " Nor I ! Nor I ! " " Then it only remains to survey the place and see that allP162are dealt with fairly . Mr. Young and I will undertake the task , and propose boundaries for the approval of all hands . Let us meet again one evening , say a fortnight from now . " " Ye 've an easy task , sir , " remarked McCoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour back . The island ' 11 divide itself natural into nine shares . " " Nine ! " exclaimed Christian . " Thirteen , you mean . " " Surely ye ' re nae counting the Indians , sir ? " " Would you leave them out ? " " There ' s nae call to share with ' em . " Christian controlled his temper with an effort . " Is this your idea of justice , McCoy ? " he asked quietly . Alexander Smith spoke up . " Think of Minarii , Will ! Think of Tetahiti ! How would they feel if we did as ye propose ? There ' s land and to spare for five times our numbers ! We ' d be fools to stir up bad blood ! " " We 've oursel 's to think on , Alex , " replied McCoy stubbornly . " Oursel 's and our bairns . The Indians can work our lands and share what they grow . " " That ' s my notion ! " put in Martin approvingly . " I ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Mills exclaimed : " Aye ! Well spoke ! " " Listen ! " ordered Christian quietly . " Think of the consequences of such a step . All of you know something of the Indian tongue . They have a word , oere , which is their greatest term of contempt . It means a landless man . Two of our four Indian men were chiefs and great landowners on their own islands . Would you reduce them to the condition of oere here ? Attempt to make them slaves , or dependents on our bounty ? We have land and to spare , as Smith says . To leave the Indians out of the division would be madness ! Their sense of justice is as keen as our own . Do you wish to make enemies of them , who will brood over their grievances and hate us more bitterly each day ? Make no mistake ! IP163would feel the same were I treated as you propose to treat these men who have been our friends ! " McCoy shook his head . " I can nae see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's to think on , and we ' ve the right to call for a show of hands  --  ye promised that ! " " Mr. Christian is right , " said Young . " Such a course would be madness . Bloodshed would come of it  --  I ' m sure of that ! " Brown ventured to remark , " Well spoken , Mr. Young , " but he shrank before the black look Martin turned on him . " We want a show of hands , sir , " growled Mills , " and we want it now ! " " You ' re in the right , " Christian said sternly . " See that you do n't misuse it ! McCoy 's proposal is folly of the most dangerous kind ! So be it . . . . Shall we divide the island into nine shares , leaving the Indians out ? " McCoy raised his hand , as did Quintal , Mills , Williams , and Martin . They were five against the other four . " One thing I must insist on , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so serious , so charged with fatal consequences , that you must give it further thought . We shall meet again , the first of October . I trust that one or more of you will change his ideas on reflection , for the step you propose would be the ruin of our settlement . Yes , the ruin ! Think it over carefully , and before you go each man is to give me his promise to say nothing of this to the Indians . " Young and Christian remained seated on the bench after the others were gone . Neither man spoke for some time , The evening was warm and bright with stars . " They hold the Indians in increasing contempt , " said Young , " and would make slaves of them , were it not for you . " Christian smiled grimly . " Make a slave of Minarii ? Or of Tetahiti ? For their own sakes I hope they attempt nothing so mad ! "  | " They are no better and no worse than the run of English seamen , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is bad in them . They are better under the stern discipline of the sea . " " They ' 11 get a taste of it if they persist in this folly ! McCoy is at the bottom of this ! Unless he has changed his mind when we meet to settle the matter in October I shall be forced to take stern measures , for his own good ! " " Aye , we are facing a crisis . I fear it was a mistake to give them the vote . You ' 11 have to play the captain once more , to save them from their own folly ! " Young rose to take his leave . When he was gone , Christian entered the house and climbed the ladder to the upper room . The sliding windows were open and the starlight illuminated the apartment dimly . He crossed the room on tiptoe to the bed-place where Maimiti and her two boys slept under blankets of tapa . Maimiti lay with her beautiful hair rippling loose over the pillow ; the younger boy slept as babies sleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . Presently Christian descended the ladder and lit a taper of candlenuts in the lower room . The Bounty 's silver-clasped Bible lay on the table ; he took up the book and began to read while the candlenuts sputtered and cracked . He read at random , here and there , as he turned the pages , for he could not sleep and dreaded to be alone with his thoughts . The Bible , which had brought comfort to so many men , brought none to Christian that night . " And the Lord passed by before him , " he read , " and proclaimed , The Lord , The Lord God , merciful and gracious , long-suffering , and abundant in goodness and truth , keeping mercy for thousands , forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin , and that will by no means clear the guilty ; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children , and upon the children 's children , unto the third and to the fourth genera-tion. "  |p165The  man sighed as he turned the pages , and presently he read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your sins . . . . I will scatter you among the heathen , and will draw out a sword after you . . . . And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies ; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them ; and they shall flee , as fleeing from a sword ; and they shall fall when none pursueth . " Christian closed the book slowly and set it down on the table at his side . He covered his face with his hands , and sat bowed , elbows on his knees . The last of the candlenuts burned down to a red glow and winked out , leaving the room in darkness , save for the faint starlight that found its way through the window . Though the bearing of the five trouble-makers grew more arrogant with the assurance that the land would soon be theirs and the Maoris their bondsmen , three weeks passed without an open break . Minarii and Moetua were building a house in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disregarded with contempt Quintal 's warning that he was a trespasser and only McCoy 's dissuasion had prevented a serious quarrel between the two . " Bide yer time , mon , " the Scot admonished him more than once . " Ye ' ve only to do that and we ' 11 put him off all lawfu ' and shipshape . " Quintal watched the building with an increasing dull anger . " Bide the devil ! " he would growl in reply . " Wait till his house is finished . . . . I ' 11 show him who owns the land ! " McCoy would shrug his shoulders impatiently . " It ' s nae beef nor brose o ' mine , but ye told Christian ye ' d bide ! " Minarii 's house was small , since only he and his wife were to live there , but it was handsomely and strongly built , with a thatch of bright yellow pandanus leaves and a floor of flat stones chinked with sand . It stood in the new clearing , on a slope of Quintal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ornamental lash- ings of the ridgepole , and on the morning when the house was finished , toward the end of the month , he strolled up to admire the completed work . Minarii was sprinkling sand from the watercourse into the chinks of his stone paepae , and straightened his back as he perceived the other approach . " Come in ! " he called . " It is finished , eh ? " remarked Tetahiti , glancing critically about the single lofty room . " You two have worked well . A pretty house ! You of Tahiti are more skillful carpenters than the men of my island . " " It is but a bush hut . Nevertheless we shall soon come here to live . It is in my mind to make a large enclosure for the breeding of swine . " Tetahiti nodded . " Aye . Pigs thrive on this island . " " Let us go inland together . I was about to set out when you came . Yesterday , in the Aute Valley , I marked down a sow with eight young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head . " I am going back to the house to sleep . It was dawn when I came in from the night fishing . " The sun was overhead when Tetahiti awoke from his siesta . He lay on a mat in the shade of a purau tree near his house , and for a moment , while he collected his thoughts confused by dreams , he stared up wild-eyed at the broad , pale green leaves which made a canopy overhead . Hearing his wife 's footstep , he sat up , yawning . Nanai was approaching with a basket of food . She smiled at her husband as she set down his dinner beside him on the mat . " Have you slept well ? " she asked . " Nihau prepared your meal . There ' s a joint of cold pig , and baked plantains , and fish of your own catching with coconut sauce . " She retired to a little distance while he ate , and fetched him a calabash of water to rinse his hands when the meal was done.  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is something I must tell you while we are alone . You must know , though I cannotbelieve it true . " He nodded to her to go on , and she continued : " Susannah told me , swearing me to secrecy . Martin told her , she said . When I tell you , you will understand why I break my word . " " Faaite mail " ordered Tetahiti , a little impatiently . " Susannah says that the whites have had a meeting , unknown to us , and have decided to portion out the land , setting stones on the boundaries of each man 's share . " " You can not believe it ? " he interrupted . " Why not ? It is our ancient custom and would avoid dissension here . " " Aye , but let me finish . She says that the Maori men are to be left out of the division , that you will be oere from now on , slaves to work the lands of the whites . " Tetahiti laughed scornfully . " A woman 's tale ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you suppose he would allow such a thing ! " " I told you I did not believe it ! " said Nanai . She left him , a little piqued in spite of herself at his receptionof the news . The man lay down once more , hands behind his head . Though incredulous of Susannah 's tale , he could not dismiss the thought of it , and little by little , as he reflected on certain things that had seemed without significancehitherto , and on the increasingly overbearing attitudeof the whites , the seed of suspicion took root in his mind . He rose slowly and took the path to Martin 's house . He found the woman he sought alone . Mills was at work in the bush , and Martin lay snoring in the shade of the banyan tree . Though dark and by no means pretty , Susannah had once been a pleasant , light-hearted girl . Three years of Martin had broken her spirit . She went about her householdduties mechanically , and rarely smiled . She gave a start at the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and asked in a low voice :  --   | " The tale you told Nanai . . . is it true ? " " She told you ? " asked Susannah nervously . " Aye . It was no more than her duty . Did you invent this woman 's story ? " " I told her only what Martin told me . " He glanced at her keenly , perceived that she was speaking the truth . " Why should he invent such lies ? " " Lies ? " said Susannah , shrugging her shoulders . " Who knows ? Perhaps it is the truth ! " Martin awakened suddenly , perceived Tetahiti at the door , and sprang to his feet . He came limping across to the house . " What d ' ye want here ? " he asked , unpleasantly . Tetahiti turned slowly and looked at the black-browed seaman with stern disdain . " To learn the truth . I think your words to this woman were lies ! " " Aid ! Aue ! " moaned Susannah , wringing her hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return the other 's glance . " That you white men have portioned out the land among you , unknown to us , and that we are to be left landless ! Did you tell her that ? " Martin stood with downcast eyes . " No , " he muttered after a moment 's pause ; " she must have invented the tale . " The native took one stride , seized him by the neck , and shook him angrily . " You lie ! Now speak the truth lest I choke it out of you ! " He released Martin , who stood half crouched , his knees trembling visibly . " Have you agreed to portion out the land ? " Reluctantly the seaman met the angry native 's eyes . " Aye , " he replied , sullenly . " And we are to be left out of the division ? " Martin nodded once more , and Tetahiti went on still more fiercely : " Did Christian consent to this ? " " Aye . " Without further speech Tetahiti turned on his heel andp169strode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pale and badly shaken , Martin stood watching him till he was out of earshot , before he entered the house , seized Susannah by the hair , and began to cuff her brutally . Christian had taken a brief nap after his dinner , and when he awakened Maimiti was standing in the doorway , a basket of tapa mallets in her hand . Balhadi stood outside . Seeing that he had opened his eyes , Maimiti said : " We are going to Brown 's Well to beat the cloth . " He sat up with a sharp twinge , for he had had a headache since dawn and felt irritable and out of sorts . " Let Balhadi go . Do n't work to-day . Who knows at what moment the pains may begin ! " " Our child will not be born before night . " " Then work at something here if you must work . It is madness to go inland at a time like this . " Usually the most affectionate and docile of wives , Maimiti was now in one of the perverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stubbornly . " I desire to go , and I am going . Men do not understand these things ! " He said no more as the two women turned away and walked down the path . He was thinking , in a mood of dejectedirritation , of the gulf which divided Polynesians and whites . No man respected the good qualities of the natives more , but they seemed willful as children , believing that the wish justified the act , and living so much in the present that they were incapable of worry , of plans for the future , or of ordered thought . He rose and stood in the doorway , with a hand on his aching head . The short , burly figure of Alexander Smith appeared beneath the trees . He was coming down the path from the Goat-House , and perceiving Christian at the door , he approached , holding up a rusty axe . " I found it , sir ! " he announced.  | " Good ! Where ? " " On the ridge . Where Tetahiti was felling that tap n tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt its edge absently . " It ' s the best I have left . The Indians ! When they finish a bit of work , no matter where , they drop their tools and forget where they 've left ' em . . . . They ' re all alike ! " Smith grinned . " Ye ' re right , sir ! D ' ye think I can learn my old woman to put things back where they belong ? Not if we was to live in the same house for a hundred years ! " " Aye , there are times when they would try a saint . " Presently Smith took leave of Christian , who went into the house once more and lay down on his settee . The violent throbbing of his headache moderated as he closed his eyes ; he was drifting into a troubled sleep when the sound of rapid steps aroused him . Never in his life had Tetahiti entered any man 's house  --  chief 's or commoner 's  --  without the customary hail and pause for the invitation from within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first law of Polynesian courtesy . But now he entered Christian 's garden , strode up the path without a halt , and in through the open door . Christian opened his eyes . Before he could speak the man was standing over him with a scowl on his face , blurting out in a voice vibrant with anger : " Is it true ? True that you whites have held a secret meeting ? That you have dared to divide the land among you , leaving us as oere , as slaves ? " Taken completely by surprise , Christian said : " Who told you this ? " " No matter ! " replied Tetahiti furiously . " Is it true ? " " Yes . . . no . . . let me explain to you . . . " " I knew it ! " the other cut him short . Christian controlled his temper with an effort . " Sit down , Tetahiti . I will explain . "  | " Explain ! There is nothing to explain . It is shame I feel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief ? You are no better than Quintal ! Aye , no better than Martin , that base-born hog ! " The white man sprang up and faced the other so sternly that he recoiled a pace . Then , composing himself with a violenteffort , he went on : " Sit down ! You must know . . . " The native interrupted him fiercely : " Enough ! " He spun on his heel and flung himself out through the door . " Wait ! " called Christian in a voice anxious and peremptory . There was no reply . Tetahiti strode down the path to Bounty Bay , glancing neither right nor left , nor returning the salutations of his countrywomen in the houses of the mutineers . He found his wife awaiting him at the door . She had been watching his approach with anxious eyes . " Where is Minarii ? " he asked gruffly . " Is it true ? " " Where is Minarii ? " " He has not been here ; I think he is at his new house in the bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Nanai took his arm and gazed up anxiously at his face . He shook her off without a word and turned away as abruptly as he had come . It was mid-afternoon ; a still , warm day in early spring . The trees shadowing the lower parts of Quintal 's valley were beautiful with the pale green of new foliage ; a clear , slender brooklet , revived by recent rains , trickled down the watercourse . While still at some distance from the house of Minarii , Tetahiti became aware of a faint scent of burning wood ; glancing up , he perceived that a column of smoke rose above the tree-tops ahead . As he reached the edge of the clearing , he gave a deep exclamation of astonishment . Only a pile of smouldering embers marked the spot where the newly completed house had stood . Close by , with arms folded , and head bent as if deep in brooding thought , he perceived the gigantic figure of the chief . Minarii turned his head as the other approached . " What is this ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Quintal 's work ! " They were silent for a time , both staring at the embers with sombre eyes . At last Tetahiti said : " Let us sit down , Minarii . There is something you must know . "  |p173THE  house of Quintal and McCoy had long been in darkness . Their sleeping rooms were on the upper floor , divided by a partition of matting . The ground floor was used as a common room and was furnished with two tables , some roughly made chairs and benches , and a cupboard used for food and to contain various household utensils . Some time after midnight , Minarii stole silently out of this dwelling and proceeded in the direction of Christian 's house . A light was burning there , for Maimiti was in labour with her third child , and a number of the women were gathered to assist Balhadi , who was the most skillful midwife among them . Minarii advanced with the greatest caution and halted at the edge of the clearing , where he crouched for some time , listening and watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could make out the forms of Christian and Young walking back and forth across the grassplot on the north side of the house , and those of various women seated on the bench by the open doorway . Withdrawing as noiselessly as he had come , he crossed the belt of forest land , skirting some of the nearer gardens of the settlement until he came to a footpath leading over the western ridge . Crossing the ridge and descending the slope for some distance , he struck into another path which entered the ravine which the white men called Temple Valley by reason of its having been set aside by Christian for the use of the native men in the practices of their religion . This valley , narrow and rocky , was , in fact , little more than a gorge , and near the head wall , in a cleft not a dozen paces across , the natives had erected the stone platform that served as their rnarae . The path leading to it was steep , winding over the roots of great trees and among rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was familiar with every foot of the way , and , dark as it was , he proceeded without hesitation . Mounting steadily , he came at length to a huge boulder that all but blocked further passageway . Here he halted . " Tetahiti ? " he called , in a low voice . " E , teie , " came the reply , almost at his side . The darkness was intense ; scarcely a gleam of starlight penetrated the foliage of the great trees overarching the ravine . Minarii seated himself with his back to the rock . " The others have come ? " he asked . " We are here , " a voice replied . " Listen well , " said Minarii . " In the house of Quintal and McCoy there were , as you know , two muskets . I have taken these , and the powder and ball kept by them . You have done what was agreed , Tetahiti ? " " I have the muskets from Young 's house , and Nihau has those of Mills and Martin . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will not the weapons be missed ? " Nihau asked . " That is a chance that must be taken , " said Minarii . " I have my ironwood club , " said Nihau . " I care not whether I carry a musket . " " You speak foolishly , " Minarii replied . " ' We have not to do with men of our own race , here . Our purpose is to kill them , and quickly . I have my club , but I shall carry a musket as well , and you shall do the same . " " It must now be decided whether any are to be spared , " said Tetahiti . " I am thinking of Christian . " " Wait , " said Minarii . " Let us first consider the others . Five I can kill with joy in my heart  --  Quintal , Williams , Martin , Mills , and McCoy. "  | " We waste words in speaking of these , " Tetahiti replied . " I long to see them dead , " Nihau added , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Good . Four remain . We must be of one mind about them . Tetahiti , speak now of Christian . " " You ask a hard thing , Minarii . He is a brave and good man , and our friend . " " Our friend ? " There was scorn in Minarii ' s voice . " Does a friend insult his friends ? He is a chief in his own land . He knows you and me to be chiefs in ours . And he has agreed to divide the land among his own men , leaving us with nothing , as though we were slaves ! Had he spit in our faces , the shame could not have been greater . " " Your anger is just , " Tetahiti replied , " but what he has done was not meant to shame us , this I know . " " And how do you know ? " " This is what he once told me : his men must have a voice here , equal with his own . Those who are strongest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their chief . " " That is a lie ! " Minarii replied . " One of two things must be true : either he is no chief , as we have believed , or he wishes to shame us . The first can not be so . Would he be ruled , then , by pigs of men such as Quintal and Mills and Martin ? Would he bow to them in a thing so important as the division of our lands if he did not wish us ill ? " " I have nothing to reply , " said Tetahiti . " My mind is as dark as your own ; yet I can not believe that Christian wishes to shame us . " " Why , then , should he do so ? " Minarii asked . " A chief does what he wills . Christian and Young shall both be killed , " he continued , quietly . " Let their deaths be at my hands . Even though it were as you have said , do you not see that they must die ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Young are men . They would take their just revenge upon us . " Tetahiti was long in replying . " It is true , " he said at length . " There is no other way . But understand this , Minarii : he who kills Christian shall call me friend no longer . " " Let that be as it will , " Minarii replied , grimly . " The island is large enough . You can go with your women to one side . I will go with mine to the other . " " Minarii , " said Tetahiti , " Brown is your friend . Is he to be spared ? " " He is like my brother , a younger brother . He has nothing but good in his heart . He will see us coming and suspect nothing . Who could strike him down ? " " It can be done , " said Te Moa . " Let him be among the last when our blood is hot and the lust for killing upon us all . I could do it then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Brown shall die , " said Tetahiti . " I see that it must be so , " Minarii replied ; " but you shall not touch him , Te Moa ! Tetahiti shall kill my friend , since I am to kill his . But see that you do it swiftly , you man from Tupuai ! " " My hand shall be as steady as your own . His death shall be as swift as you make that of Christian . " " It remains to be seen whether this land will seem as large as I thought , with the white men dead , " said Minarii . " It may be too small to hold us two . " When Tetahiti replied , the anger was gone from his voice . " Enough , Minarii . Let there be no hot words between us . I see that my friend must die . Can you be blind to the need of death for your own ? His life , alone , among the slayers of his countrymen would seem to him worse than death . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Minarii replied , coldly . " Let no more be said of him . "  | " One remains to be spoken of . What of Smith ? " " A brave and good man who has done none of us harm , " said Nihau . " Evil is the need that calls for his death . " " There is no other way , " said Minarii . " It must be as Nihau says . " They were silent for some time ; then Minarii again spoke . " I say this for you , Nihau , and Te Moa . We four have nine to kill . There must be no blundering , and you must do exactly as we say . " " So it shall be , " Nihau replied . " The plan shall be in your hands , Minarii , " said Tetahiti . It falls to you of right as the older man . " " I am content , " Minarii replied , " and I must be obeyed as you would obey a chief in war . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is not war , and it will be a shame to us forever that we must kill men as hogs are killed for the oven ; yet it must be done . " " If we used no secrecy in this affair , Minarii , but challengedthose five to fight us four ? " asked Tetahiti . " That is spoken like a chief , " said Minarii . " It is what I , myself , would most desire , but Christian would never allow them to accept such a challenge ; then our purpose would be known and our chance for killing them gone . " " ' We could wait , " said Nihau , " making a pretence of friendship until their minds were again at rest . When they believed we had forgotten we could fall upon them as we plan to do now . " " Speak no more of this , " said Minarii , sternly . " Could you wait in patience for such a time ? If I have my way they shall all be dead before another sun has set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tetahiti . " That must first be known . " " It is willed that they shall die ; that is certain , " said Mi/narii . " Whether or not it shall be in the coming day we shall soon know . " The strip of sky above them was now suffused with a faint ashy light , sifting like impalpable dust into the gloom of the ravine . Soon the dim outlines of trees and rocks and the crags above them could be discerned , and the forms of the men , who had long been only voices in the darkness , were revealed to each other . Minarii sat by the boulder where he had first halted . He was a man of commanding presence . Naked , save for the strip of bark cloth about his loins , he seemed equally unconscious of the chill dampness of the night air and of the long fatigue of his motionless position . Tetahiti sat near him , his back to a tree and his legs outstretched . The thick mantle of tapa around his shoulders was wet and limp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were seated on the lowest of the roughly laid stone steps that led to the marae . The ravine was extremely narrow at this point , and beyond the stone platform the fern and moss-covered head wall rose toward the ribbon of sky in a series of giant steps of basaltic rock . Presently Minarii rose . Nihau and Te Moa made way for him as he mounted the stone staircase to the platform of the marae . Tetahiti removed his mantle and followed , the other two bringing up the rear . They waited in silence at the summitof the staircase while Minarii retired to a small thatched house at one side of the marae . He appeared a moment later in his ceremonial robes , whereupon Tetahiti proceeded to the rocky recess where the casket containing the god was kept . This was brought to the altar stone in the centre of the platform . All four now took their places at the kneeling stones and the ceremony of awakening the god was carried out . A moment of deep silence followed ; then Minarii made his prayer : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Judge , Thou , if we have summoned Thee amiss.  |p179Judge  , Thou , if our wrongs are great and our cause just . Known to Thee is the cause before tongue can speak ; Therefore it is told . If our anger is Thy anger , let it be known ! If the time favours , speak ! " A few moments later the four men filed down from the marae , and as soon as they were beyond sacred ground Minarii halted and turned to face his companions . " Our success is sure , " he said , " and now we must not rest until they are all dead . " " What is first to be done ? " asked Tetahiti . " You and I should return to the village , " said Minarii . " Our absence may be wondered at , but if we two go down they will suspect nothing . " " I have promised to obey you , " said Tetahiti , " but this thing I can not do . Maimiti 's child must now have come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have to do . " " That was to be expected , and we shall not go down , " Minarii replied . " Nihau alone shall go . " " What shall I do there ? " Nihau asked . " Tell the first woman you meet that I am hunting pig , with Williams , and that you three will be fishing until evening from the rocks below the western valley . Go now and return quickly . " The path from the settlement to the western valley crossed the high lands a little below the Goat-House Peak . Here it branched , a second trail leading southward along the ridge to the partially clear lands of the Aute Valley . The ridge was bare at the junction of the two paths , and at this point was a rustic bench used as a resting place on journeys across the island . Not far to the right rose a small heavily wooded spur which commanded a view of the ridge and of the valleys on either side . Here Minarii , Tetahiti , and Te Moa now lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet risen , but a few ribbed clouds , high in air , glowed with saffron-coloured light . A faint easterly breeze was blowing , fragrant with the breath of sea and land . The summit of the spur was only a few yards in extent . Tetahiti and Te Moa , their muskets beside them , lay at a point directly above the junction of the two paths . Minarii watched the steep approach from the settlement . That people were astir there was evident from the threadlikecolumns of wood smoke that rose straight into the air f above the forests until caught by the breeze , which spread them out in gossamer-like canopies above the dwelling houses . The houses themselves were hidden from view ; not even the clearings , some of them of considerable extent , could be seen from above . Save for the smoke , the island , in whateverdirection , presented the appearance of a solitude that had never been disturbed by the presence of man . Half an hour passed . Minarii crept back to where the others were lying . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the rustic bench and plunged into the thicket to the right . When he had joined them the four men crouched close , talking in low voices . " They suspect nothing , " said Nihau . " I met Nanai , Moetua , and Susannah on their way to the rock cistern . They will be making tapa to-day . " " You saw Christian ? " asked Tetahiti . " No . He and Young are still at Christian 's house . Maimiti'schild was born just before the dawn . " " Is the child a boy or a girl ? " " A girl . " " What men have you seen ? " asked Minarii . " Only Smith , carrying water down from the spring to Christian 's house . " " Minarii , it is a hard thing to kill Christian on this day when his child is born , " said Tetahiti . " It is a hard thing , " Minarii replied , " nevertheless we shallp181do as we have planned , and now two of us shall go quickly to Williams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dead . " " Then he shall fall at my hands , " said Tetahiti . " Christianmay work in his yam garden to-day . He may be the first to come this way and I would not be the one left to meet him here . " " That is as it should be , " said Minarii . " Te Moa shall go with you . See that Williams 's woman is not allowed to escape . Take her and bind her . Carry her to the lower end of the small valley behind Williams 's house . She must be left there until we come to release her . " " It shall be done , " said Tetahiti . He grasped his musket and was about to rise when Minariilaid a hand on his arm . A moment later Hutia appeared on the path leading from Williams 's house . She carried a basket with a tapa mallet projecting from it , and was humming softly to herself as she sauntered along the path . Upon reaching the bench she seated herself there for a moment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger and rubbed the place ; then she held her small pretty hands out before her , regarding them approvingly as she turned them this way and that . The valley was all golden now in the light of the just-risen sun . The girl rose and stood for a moment looking down over the forests . Still singing , she went lightly down the path and disappeared among the trees . " It is plain from this that our god was not awakened unwisely , " said Minarii . " He is ordering events to suit our purposes and now none of you can doubt that this is the day appointed for what we must do . " " I see it , " said Tetahiti . " Wait here . We shall soon return . " Followed by Te Moa , he made his way through the thick bush below the spur , and was soon lost to view.  | " It will be well if Christian comes now , " said Nihau . " Nothing shall be done here , " said Minarii . " If any turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow . If they go down into the western valley , we will wait here until Tetahiti returns . Now watch and speak no more . " Christian and Young were seated in a small open pavilion on the seaward side of Christian 's house . Christian held his eldest child , now a sturdy lad of three years , on his lap . " You must make haste , Ned , " he was saying , " else I shall have such a start as you will never be able to overcome . " Young smiled . " Taurua and I are both envious of you and Maimiti , " he replied . " The poor girl is beginning to fear that we are to have no children . " " Taurua ? Nonsense ! She ' 11 bear you a dozen before she ' s through . What a difference children will make , here , in a few years ' time ! What a change they have brought already ! " " What are we to do in the matter of their education ? Have you considered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in our sense of the word , " Christianreplied . " You sha n't teach them to read and write ? " " What end would it serve ? Consider the difficulty we should have in trying to give children , who will know life only as they see it here , a conception of our world , our religion . Let their mothers ' religion be theirs as well . Save for the cult of Oro , the war god , the Indian beliefs are as beautiful as our own , and in many respects less stern and savage . We believe in God , Ned ; so do they . It would be a mistake , I think , to mingle the two conceptions . " " You may be right , " Young replied , doubtfully ; " and yet , when I think of the future . . . " " When our children are grown , you mean ? " " Yes . What would our parents think , could they seep183their grandchildren , brought up as heathens , worshiping in the Indian fashion ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small chance of their ever knowing of these grandchildren . " They were silent for some time . Christian sat stroking the thick black hair of the solemn little lad on his lap . " If the chance were offered , Ned , of looking into the future , would you accept it ? " " I should want time to consider the matter , " Young replied . " I would ; whatever it might reveal , I should like to know . What would I not give to see this boy , twenty years hence , and the second lad , and the little daughter born this morning ! God grant that their lives may be happier than mine has been ! It is strange to think that they will never know any land but this ! " " We ca n't be certain of that . " " Not completely certain , but chances are strongly against any other possibility . We must make it a happy place for them . We can and we shall , " he added , earnestly . " But get you home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough after this all-night vigil . " " They are , I admit . And what of yourself ? Why not come to my house for a little rest ? We sha n't be disturbed there . " " No , I feel thoroughly refreshed , now that Maimiti 's ordealis over . This evening I shall call the men together . Whether they will or no , the division of land shall be altered to include the Indians and on equal terms with ourselves . " " It is a wise decision , Christian ; one we shall never regret , I am certain of that . " Christian accompanied his friend a little distance along the path . Returning to the house , he tiptoed to the door of Maimiti 's chamber and opened it gently . Balhadi sat crosslegged on the floor by the side of the bed . The newly born infant lay asleep in a cradle made of one of Christian 's sea chests . He crossed the room softly and stood for a moment looking down at Maimiti . She opened her eyes and smiled wanly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " I heard you in my sleep . " He knelt down beside the bed , stroking her hair tenderly . She took his other hand in both of hers . " Aue , Christian ! Such a time this little fledgling gave me ! Her brothers came so easily , but I thought she would never come . " " I know , dear . Are you comfortable now ? " " Yes ; how good it is to rest ! Does she please you , this little daughter ? " " She will be like you , Maimiti . Balhadi and Taurua both say so . Already I love her . " " There  --  I am content . Balhadi , let me have her . . . . Oh , the darling ! How pretty she is ! " Balhadi laid the sleeping child in the mother 's arms , and a moment later Maimiti herself had fallen into a profound slumber . On the spur overlooking the ridge , Minarii and Nihau were still waiting , so well concealed that no scrutiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they had a clear view of the ridge and of the bench there which faced eastward , a little to the left of the path . The sun was well above the horizon when the sound of voices was heard from below , and shortly afterwards Mills appeared , followed by Martin . The men were bare to the waist and wore well-patched seamen 's trousers chopped off at the knee . Their heads were protected by handkerchiefs knotted at the four corners . Upon reaching the summit of the ridge they halted . Martin walked to the bench and sat down . " Do as ye like , John , " he said , " I ' 11 have a blow . "  | " Aye , " said Mills , " ye ' d set the day long if ye could have yer way . " " Where ' s the call for haste ? Come , set ye down , man , and cool off . There ' 11 be time enough to sweat afore the day ' s done . " Mills joined his companion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech . " Have ye seen Christian this morning ? " Martin asked , presently . Mills shook his head . " My woman was over half the night . This bairn ' s a girl , she says . " " Aye ; that makes seven , all told , for the lot of us , and three of ' em Christian 's . " " And where ' s yours ? " Mills asked . " What ' s wrong with ye , Marty , that your woman 's not thrown a foal in three years ? " " Ye 've no great call to boast , with the one , " Martin replied . " The fault ' s Susannah 's  --  that I ' 11 warrant . " " Aye , lay it to the woman , " Mills replied scornfully . " And why not ? I board her times enough . If she was a wench from home , now , she ' d be droppin ' her young ' un a year , reg'lar as clockwork . She ' s bloody stubborn , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better now ? " " She ' s not whimperin ' for Tahiti all the while , the way she was . I ' ve beat that out of her . . . . What ' s that ? A shot , was n't it ? " " Aye . That ' 11 be Williams . Huntin ' pig , I reckon . " " I 've a mind to go myself this afternoon ; there ' s a fine lot o ' pig runnin ' wild in the gullies yonder . What do ye say we invite ourselves to dinner with Jack ? I ' ve not seen him this week past . " " I ' m willin ' ; but come along now . We ' ve work and to spare , to get through afore dinner time . " " Damn yer eyes , John ! Ca n't ye set for half an hour ? The day ' s young yet . "  | " Dawdle if ye like , ye lazy hound ! I ' m goin ' . " " Fetch my axe from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin called after him . Mills went on without replying and was lost to view below the crest of the ridge . Nihau turned slightly and slipped his musket forward , glancing at Minarii as he did so . The chief , without turning his head , stretched out a hand to stay him . In the stillness of the early morning the crowing of the cocks could be heard and the rhythmical sound of tapa mallets in the valley below . Martin sat leaning forward , his elbows on his knees , his hands clasped loosely , gazing vacantly at the ground between his bare feet . Presently he turned to look down the path along the ridge to his right . Tetahiti and Te Moa were approaching , their bodies half hidden by the fern on either side of the path . After a casual glance , Martin turned away again . At sight of him , Tetahiti stopped short , then came quickly on , changing his musket from his right hand to his left . As they neared , Martin again turned his head slightly to give them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are ye ? " he said , derisively . " And where ' s the bloody pig ? Safe enough , I ' II warrant ! Which of ye missed fire ? I heard but the one shot . " The two natives stood before him without speaking . Martin rose , lazily . " Give me yer piece , " he said , to Te Moa . " I ' 11 learn ye how to put in a charge , and much good may it do ye . " He stepped forward , holding out his hand for the musket . With the quickness of a cat , Tetahiti seized him by the wrist . At the same moment Minarii and Nihau appeared from the bush at the side of the ridge . Passing his musket to Te Moa , Nihau stepped forward and seized Martin by the other arm , and before the white man could again speak he was half pushed , half dragged along the path leading to the Aute Valley . For a few seconds he was too astonished to offerp187resistance ; then he held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What ' s the game ? " he cried , hoarsely . " Let me go , ye brown bastards ! Let me go , I say ! . . . John ! John ! " " Loose him , " said Minarii . Tetahiti and Nihau released their holds . Minarii reached forward and grasped him by the back of the neck . Martin howled with pain in the powerful grasp of the chief , who held him at arm 's length , with one hand . " Dona ' ee , Minarii ! " he cried , in an anguished voice . " Do n't ' ee , now ! " The chief dropped his hand . " Walk , " he said . About one hundred yards beyond there was a broad slope of partially clear land . They turned off here . They had gone but a little way when Martin again halted and turned toward Minarii . His eyes were dilated with terror . He glanced quickly from one to another of the four men . " What do ye want ? " he cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Nihau ! . . . For God 's sake , ca n't ye speak ? " Minarii again reached forward to grasp him . Of a suddenMartin 's legs went limp and he fell to his knees . They lifted him up and he fell again . " Carry him , " said Tetahiti . Nihau and Te Moa grasped his arms , lifting him , and carried him along with his legs dragging on the ground . At a sign from Minarii they dropped him at a spot where a great pile of brush had been heaped up for burning . Martin fell prone . He turned his head , his eyes glaring wildly . Minarii motioned to Te Moa , who stepped back , unloosing the long bush knife fastened by a thong to his belt . Martin struggled to his knees . " Oh , my God ! Do n't ' ee , lads ! Do n't ' ee kill me ! " With an awful cry he sprang to his feet , but Nihau was upon him at once , and , throwing out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be quick , " said Minarii in a contemptuous voice . As Martin again rose to his knees , Te Moa swung the long , keen blade with all his force , taking off his head at a blow.  | The air seemed to be ringing still with the last despairing cry of the murdered man . The head , which appeared to leap from the body , had rolled a little way down the slope . Te Moa ran after it and held it aloft with an exultant shout , letting the blood stream down his arm . Scarcely had he clone so when Mills appeared , axe in hand , at the edge of the clearing . At sight of Te Moa , whose back was toward him , he stopped short ; then with a bellow of fury he rushed upon him . Te Moa turned and leaped aside just in time to save himself . The impetus carried the white man past him , and before he could again turn and raise his axe , Minarii , concealed from his view by the brush pile , sprang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke Mills 's arm and sent the axe flying from his hand . The boatswain lurched to one side , and Nihau , swinging his club at arm 's length , brought it down with crushing force on the man 's head . They dragged the two bodies into the thicket beyond the clearing , where Nihau , with a clean stroke of his knife , severed the head of Mills from the trunk . Te Moa cut a small straight branch from an ironwood tree , shaving it down and rounding it , sharpening it to a needle 's point at one end . Laying Martin 's head on the ground , he drove the ironwood splinter through it , from ear to ear . A thong of bark was pulled through with it , and he then fastened the head at his hip , to his belt of sharkskin . Nihau did the like with Mills 's head . Minarii and Tetahiti squatted near by , watching . Minarii rose . " Come , " he said . He grasped his club and his musket and made his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed . They came to a little hollow under the western side of the ridge , well screened by fern and not more than a dozen paces below the junction of the paths . Here Minarii halted , and the others crouched beside him . Minarii turned to Nihau . " Watch there , " hep189said , pointing to the spur above them . " If any come , throw a handful of earth here where we wait . " Nihau took his musket and disappeared in the fern . " This plan was well made , " said Tetahiti . " There is no honour in killing men so ; yet it must be done , " said Minarii . They spoke no more after that . Presently there was a light patter of earth and small pebbles among the fern that sheltered them . Minarii lay on his belly , and drew himself forward a little way . Severalminutes passed ; then they heard the light tread of bare feet along the path in front of them , and a slight rustling and rasping of the bushes on either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He waited for a few seconds , then rose to his knees and glanced to left and right over the top of the fern . " Who passed ? " Tetahiti asked . Minarii avoided his glance . " You have agreed to obey me this day as you would obey a chief in war . Wait here , then  --  you and Te Moa . " Tetahiti rose to his knees and looked down over the thickly wooded land below them , but there was no one to be seen . Stooping , he seized Minarii 's musket and thrust it into his hand . " Your club shall be left here , " he said . " Go quickly . " Two hundred yards from their hiding place , on a shaded knoll , a combined tool- and store-house had been erected for the common use . Minarii crept forward until he could command a view of this house . He saw Christian appear with an axe in his hand and go on down the path . Minarii then examined carefully the charge in his musket . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of axe strokes in the forest beyond . Taking up his musket , he proceeded in that direction . Several small clearings had been made on these upland slopes . Minarii halted opposite the second one . Christianp190was at work a short distance from the path , hewing down a large purua tree . He swung his axe steadily , with the deliberatemeasured strokes of a skilled woodsman . His back was toward Minarii , who approached stealthily , his musket held in one hand , until he was not ten paces distant . " Christian , " he called , quietly . Christian turned his head . Seeing who it was , he leaned his axe against the tree . " Oh , Minarii . " He straightened his back and flexed the muscles of his shoulders , turning toward the native as he did so . Of a sudden the faint smile on his face vanished . " What is it ? " he asked . For a second or two they stood regarding each other , Minariigrasping his musket in both hands . An expression of amazement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then one of sombre recognition of his danger . He stepped back quickly , reaching behind him as he did so toward his axe . With a swift movement , the chief raised his musket to his shoulder and fired . Christian staggered back against the tree ; then sank to his knees , his head down , swaying slightly . Of a sudden he fell forward and lay still.  |p191ALEXANDER  SMITH 'S taro garden lay in swampy ground within a five-minute walk of the settlement . He had been at work there for some time , knee-deep in mud , clearingthe weeds and water grass from around the young plants . Having reached the end of a row , he waded to firm ground , cleaned his muddy hands on the grass , and sat down to rest . Rising presently to resume his work , he stopped short , hearing his name called . For a moment he saw no one ; then Jenny appeared from behind a covert and ran headlong toward him . " What is it , jenny ? " " Come quickly ! " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him into the forest beyond the clearing . Halting there , she was unable to speak for a moment , holding out her hands , which were smeared with blood . Then she burst into a torrent of words . " It is Brown 's blood , not mine , that you see ! Tetahiti has killed him ! Have you heard no shots ? " " Yes , but . . .99 " Tetahiti has killed him , I tell you ! They are all together --  Tetahiti , Minarii , Nihau , and Te Moa . They have muskets , clubs , and knives . Three are already dead . Where is Christian ? " " He has gone to the Aute Valley . " " Then he too must be dead ! Come quickly ! Arm your-self ! " " Wait , Jenny ! You say . . . "  | " Will you come ? " she cried , wringing her hands . " Mills 's head I have seen ! It is hanging at Nihau 's belt ! They are seeking you now ! " Faintly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot was heard . " There ! Will you believe me ? It is not pig they are shooting , but men ! " She turned and sped down the slope toward the settlement . Smith ran after her and seized her hand . " Maimiti must know nothing of this , Jenny ! You understand ? Now do as I tell you ! Young is asleep in his house . Go and warn him . Tell him I will meet him there . I must fetch Christian 's musket . " The woman nodded and sped on down the path . All was silent in Christian 's house . The door stood open . Smith entered softly . Balhadi lay asleep on the floor by the door leading to Maimiti 's chamber . Smith shook her gently by the shoulder . She sat up quickly , rubbing her eyes . " Aug ! Oh , it is you , Alex . Shh ! We must not disturb Maimiti . She is having a good sleep . She needs it , poor child ! " " ' Where is Christian 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me see . Yes , it is hanging on the wall in the other room . " " Fetch it , with the powder flask and the bullet pouch . " Smith returned to the door and looked out . The little glade lay peaceful and deserted . Balhadi returned with the musket . " What is it , Alex ? " she asked , in a low voice . Motioning her to follow him , Smith went around the dwellingto a small outbuilding used as a storehouse . " Listen , Balhadi , what you feared has happened . The Maoris are killing the white men . . . " " Aug ! " " I have met Jenny . Three are already dead , she says . She has seen Nihau with Mills 's head at his belt . Te Moa hasp193Martin 's . Brown is dead . Christian may be , but that is not known . Where is Young ? " " At his house , I think . Go quickly , Alex ! " " You must stay with Maimiti . Say nothing to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you need to tell me that ? Go ! Make haste ! " Save for the clearings made for the houses and the path to the cove , the forests of the island had been little disturbed along the seaward slope of the plateau . Smith ran across the path into the heavily wooded land , making his way with great caution toward Young 's house . Jenny , Prudence , and Taurua were standing in the dooryard . Smith revealed himselfat the edge of the clearing . Taurua ran toward him at once . " Ned is not here , Alex , " she said , in a trembling voice . " He came home to sleep  --  that I know . I left Maimiti only a little time ago . Ned was not in the house when I came , and we ca n't find him . " " You must find him ! " " We shall if he is alive , but we are afraid to call out . Two shots have been fired in the direction of Quintal 's planta-tion . " " I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball . Run ! " Taurua returned , bringing only a cutlass . Jenny followed her . " The muskets are gone , both yours and Ned 's , " she said . " They must have taken them in the night . " " Then you must keep this one for Young , " he said , handing her the weapon . " Give me the cutlass . " " What shall you do ? " " I must find Christian , if he is alive . Now go , all three of you , and search for Young . I shall make my way to the Aute Valley . If I find that the others are dead , I shall hide near the Goat-House . Tell Young to come there . "  | He then reentered the forest and was lost to view . The three women separated and continued their search . Taurua , having hidden the musket , went along the seaward slope , examining every hollow among the rocks , every clump of bushes . Presently she found Young , stretched out on a grassy slope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , unable to speak ; then she quickly informed him of what had happened . He gazed at her in silence for a moment . " Ned ! Are you awake ? " she cried . " Do you understand what I say ? " " Only too well . Christian is dead , I fear . You say Alex left his musket for me ? Why did you let him , Taurua ? " " Why ? Because he is stronger than you ! He can defend himself well with a cutlass . " Young rose . " I must find him at once , " he said . " Where is the musket ? " Taurua went ahead . A moment later she beckoned Young to follow . Prudence and Jenny had returned to the house . There was a window at the eastern end of the dwelling overlooking the path in the direction of the cove . Prudence , her child in her arms , kept watch there . Jenny watched from the window at the opposite end of the house . Taurua brought the musket from the bushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half filled , and there were only four balls in the bullet pouch . Young had just seated himself to charge the musket when Prudence called softly from the window : " Hide , Ned ! . . . Minarii ! " Taurua seized him by the arm and pulled him into the room adjoining . Two large chests stood there , near the bed . Young crouched between them and Taurua threw over him a large piece of tapa . Jenny concealed herself behind the curtains of the bed-place . Prudence remained at the window , crooning softly to her child . Taurua reentered the common room and quickly seated herself on a stool inp195one corner , resuming a task , interrupted some time before , of grating coconut meat into a bowl . She had herself well in hand . A moment later Minarii appeared in the doorway . He now carried only his musket . He greeted them casually . Taurua looked up , smiling . She did not trust herself to speak at first . " Where are you going , Minarii ? " Prudence asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning ? " " E , " he replied , " Williams and I. We wounded a large boar on the ridge . He ran down into the Main Valley . We have not yet found him . Where is Young , Taurua ? " " Fishing , at the cove . He went early this morning . " Minarii glanced around the room . " If you pass Brown 's house , " said Prudence , " will you tell Jenny that I have the bundle of reeds for her ? I ' 11 carry it up this afternoon . " " I ' 11 tell her if I see her . " He took up his musket , nodding to the two women as he turned away . " A noho , orna . " " Haere oe , " they replied . He turned and went back the way he had come . Prudence remained at the window . " We have fooled him , Taurua . He thinks we know nothing . " " Is he keeping to the path ? " " Yes . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went quickly into the other room . A moment later Young , waiting his chance , ran out of the house and disappeared into the forest . It was getting on toward mid-morning . Young had been gone for some time . The three women sat on the bench by the doorstep , talking in low voices . " Minarii would have saved Brown ? " Taurua was saying . " He could easily have killed him had he meant to do so , " Jenny replied . " This happened : We were weeding the yam garden near the house . Minarii found us there . There is little time for words , ' he said . Three of the white men are dead . Tetahiti , Nihau , Te Moa , and I have killed them . They shall all die except Brown . Him I will save if I can . When I shoot my musket over his head he must fall to the ground and lie as dead . He must not move till the others have passed ; then let him hide in the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired into the air and pushed Brown and sent him sprawling . Go into the house ! ' he said to me . Go at once and stay there ! The others are close behind . ' He went on into the forest . Soon came the other three . I watched from a tiny hole in the thatch . They halted when they saw Brown lying on his face . They walked toward him and stopped again . Brown could not have heard them . He moved , turning his head a little . Tetahiti was not ten paces from him . He raised his musket and shot him through the head . When I saw what he would do , I ran from the house and sprang on him from behind , but it was too late . Then the three of them bound my hands and feet and carriedme into the house . As soon as I could free myself I ran to warn Alex . " " I see how it was , " said Taurua . " Minarii must have killed Christian . They must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The beast ! The vile dog ! " Jenny exclaimed , her eyes blazing . " Tetahiti shot my man as he lay on the ground ! Aare ! Am ' ! " She put her head in her arms , rocking back and forth on the bench ; but she made no further outcry . The time for weeping had not come . All three women were too stunned for tears . " Nanai must have known of this , " said Prudence , fiercely . " Both Nanai and Moetua must have known of what was to happen to-day , and they gave us no warning . " " You are wrong , Prudence , " Taurua replied . " Minariip197and Tetahiti would never have told their wives of such a plan . " " I shall hate them forever ! " " That can be understood , " said Taurua , " but they are not to be blamed . I saw them both early this morning . Had they known , I could have guessed it at once . No , they are as innocent as ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening , hearing nothingsave the crowing of cocks in the forest and the soughing of the wind through the trees . Prudence 's child awoke and began to cry . She reentered the house and took it up , nursingit in her arms as she walked the room . Taurua laid a hand on Jenny 's arm . " Listen ! " The two women turned their heads at the same moment . At the turn of the path below the house Mary and Sarah appeared , half running , half walking , carrying their children in their arms . Taurua and Jenny ran forward to meet them . Mary was weeping hysterically . " You know , Taurua ? They have been here ? " she cried . " Tell us quickly  --  are your men dead ? " " They must be ! Minarii . . . " " Hush , Mary , " said Sarah . " We do n't know that they are dead . " " They must be ! McCoy has only his bush knife . Quintalhas nothing to defend himself with . How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Do you know that your man is dead ? Ours will be next ! " The moment they had entered the house , Mary sank to the floor and lay there , her head buried in her arms . Tauruatook up her child . " What has happened , Sarah ? " she asked . " You heard the shots ? " " Yes . " " They were fired at Quintal . He and McCoy were to make a fence to-day , and Quintal had gone up the valley top198carry down some posts he had cut . He left me to sharpen his axe . I was carrying it up to him when Minarii and Te Moa stepped out from behind some bushes . Te Moa was covered with blood and he had Martin 's head hanging at his belt . Minarii took the axe from me and told me to go back to the house . Just then I saw my man come out of the bush with a bundle of poles on his shoulder . I shouted to him . Minarii and Te Moa ran toward him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Quintal ran back into the forest . " What of McCoy ? " " He was still at the house . I ran down to warn him , and before any of them came to look for him he had time to escape . " " Had the muskets at your house been taken ? " Jenny asked . " Yes . I must have looked at the very hooks where they hung , early this morning , without wondering why they were not there . " " Who came to search the house ? " " Tetahiti and Nihau . McCoy had just gone . I asked Tetahiti if they had killed Quintal . He would say nothing , but as they went out again Nihau stopped at the door . You want to know if your man is dead ? ' he asked . Yes , ' I replied . I will tell you this , ' he said ; you will be one of my women to-morrow , and Te Moa shall have Mary . ' Then he ran on after Tetahiti . " " Which way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley . What of Ned , Taurua ? And Christian and Alex ? " " They are dead ! They must be by this time ! " Mary cried in a terrified voice . Again she broke out in hysterical weeping . She clutched and held fast to Taurua 's legs . Jenny took her roughly by the shoulders . " Hush , Mary ! " she said . " What a coward you are ! Stop , I say ! Have you no spirit ? "  | " Could there be a more worthless woman ? " said Prudence , in her soft voice . " Leave her , Jenny ; there is nothing to be done with such a thing as she is . " They tried in vain to quiet her . She became more and more hysterical , clinging to Taurua with all her strength . Sarah was , herself , on the verge of panic , but controlled herself . Of a sudden , Mary raised her head . Her eyes were dilated with terror . " Come , " she said , in a low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill us , too ! Yes . . . they will kill us all ! Shhh ! Do you hear anything ? " She sprang to her feet , gazing wildly toward the door ; Taurua spoke to her soothingly . " Be silent , Mary . You are in no danger . None of the women will be killed . " " Yes ! Yes ! You have not seen them ! They are like sharks maddened with blood ! " Prudence stepped forward and struck her across the face with her open hand . " Will you be silent ? " she said . The sharp blow , better than words could have done , quieted the terrified woman . She sank down again , whimpering in a low voice . Taurua lifted her up . " Come , Mary ; lie you down in the other room . We will watch . No one shall harm you . " The others waited in silence . Presently Taurua returned . " The poor thing has worn herself out , " she said . " She will sleep , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Jenny . She held Mary 's twoyear-oldboy on her lap . " What will this son be like , " she added , " if he has his mother 's nature ? " Taurua went to the door and stood for a moment looking into the forest beyond the path . " I must return to Maimiti , " she said . " Balhadi is alone there . Stay here , you three . " " And wait , doing nothing , while all our men are killed ? " Jenny asked . " Not I ! " " What would you do ? " Sarah asked . " One thing at least I can do . My man lies on the ground before our house , a prey to the ants . His body shall be left there no longer . Prudence , will you come with me ? " " No , no , Prudence ! Stay ! " Sarah begged . " Do n't leave me alone with Mary ! " " Sarah , no possible harm can come to you here , " Taurua said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you not think that they would have done so before now ? Jenny is right . Somethingmay be done to help our men . Listen , Jenny , this you shall do : Find Hutia ; she may be at the rock cistern . She will go with you . When you have cared for your man 's body , then learn if you can what ones are dead ; if you can find Alex and Young , let them know that we think McCoy and Quintal are still living . Or , if you will , stay with Maimiti and I will go in your place . Prudence has her child ; she must remain here with Sarah and Mary . " " Stay you with Maimiti , " Jenny replied . " I will go . " So it was decided , and the two women set out on the path to Christian 's house . It was late afternoon . Prudence sat alone on the bench before Young 's house . Sarah and Mary remained within doors , their children around them , talking in whispers . Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been heard , nothing seen . Prudence turned her head . " Taurua is returning , " she said . The other two women rose and came to the door , waiting anxiously . Taurua was alone . " Jenny has not come ? " she asked . Prudence shook her head . " We have seen no one since you left , " she replied . " Who are at Christian 's house ? " " A little time after I went there , Susannah came . She was at the rock cistern with Hutia . They knew nothing until Jenny brought them word . Both have gone with Jenny . We must wait . " Taurua went to the outdoor kitchen , returning with some cold baked yams and plantains , which she placed on the table.  | " Here is food , " she said , " for those who need it . Prudence , you and Mary should eat for the sake of your babies . " She prepared some food for the two older children , who seized it greedily , but the women themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sarah ventured to the bench by the doorstep , and the four women sat there , talking little , peering into the forest beyond the path , streaked through with shafts of golden light . " Maimiti has not been told ? " Prudence asked . " She had just wakened when I went back , " Taurua replied . " She is so happy with her little daughter . She said to me : Now , Taurua , I have nothing more to wish for . ' Every little while she would send Balhadi or me to the door to look for Christian . How could we tell her ? How ? Who could do it ? " Her eyes filled with tears . " Aue , Maimiti ti e ! ' " In a moment all the women except Prudence , who sat dry-eyed , forgetting themselves and their own sorrows , were weeping together for the mother of the newly born child . " What will she do , Taurua ? " Sarah asked , at length . " We must not think of it now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do not yet know that he is dead . Let us hope while we can . " The sun had disappeared behind the western ridge before Jenny returned . Hutia and Susannah were with her . Their kirtles of tapa were torn and soiled and their arms and legs covered with cuts and bruises . As soon as they had entered the house , Taurua closed the doors and the wooden shutters to the windows . " Now , Jenny ? " she asked . The women were breathing hard . " Give us some water , " Jenny said . " Our throats are dry with dust . " They drank greedily . " We have seen Minarii and Nihau , but no one else , " Jenny began . " They passed almost within arm 's length of where we lay hidden in the fern . " " If we had had muskets we could have killed them both , " Hutia added.  | " They must have gone again to the Aute Valley , for they were coming down from the ridge . As soon as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hutia 's house . Williams 's body was lying in the doorway . He had been shot through the head . We carried him inside . Then we went to Christian 's new clearing just below the ridge . We found an axe leaning against a tree half cut through . There was blood on the ground close by , but what happened there we do not know . We searched everywhere , but could not find his body . " You saw Mills 's body ? " Prudence asked . Jenny hesitated , glancing quickly at Hutia . " No , " she said , " it must have been hidden . " " And you saw none of our men , Jenny ? No one at all ? " Sarah asked , in a trembling voice . Jenny shook her head . " That is not strange , " Taurua said , quietly . " They lie concealed . " " They are dead ! " Mary cried , burying her face in her hands . " Hush , Mary ! What a foolish woman you are ! They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be so . " " But if they are , Taurua , what can they do without weapons ? " " Ned has a musket . Alex Smith has a cutlass . Quintal is a man as strong of body as Minarii . He will cut him a club in the bush . We have reason to hope , I tell you ! " " Do you think that Minarii will rest until they are all dead ? Never ! He well knows that his own life will not be safe until all the white men have been killed . " " It is true , " Sarah said , wretchedly . " We shall never know peace now until one party or the other are all dead . " " And who wishes for peace until those four are killed ? " Jenny exclaimed . " I saw Tetahiti shoot my man as he layp203helpless on the ground . Do you think I shall rest until he himself is dead ? " " Let us speak no more of this , " said Taurua . " There has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a musket shot was heard close by . Mary ran into the house , her hands pressed to her ears . The other women rose quickly and looked at one another . " Let us go in , " said Taurua , " and make ready the house . Some of our men may have to come here to defend them-selves . " " And one of them may be lying dead within sound of our voices , " said Jenny . " I must know what has happened . You others prepare the house . " Without waiting for a reply , she ran across the path and plunged into the forest . She quickly crossed the wooded land bordering the path . Beyond this , and not more than one hundred and fifty yards from Young 's house , there was half an acre of cleared ground planted to sweet potatoes and yams . The report of the musket shot had come from this direction . Jenny halted within the border of the woodland and looked out across these gardens . She saw no one . She skirted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley , when she came upon a cutlass lying half hidden by a clump of plantains . There was fresh blood on the dead leaves near by and she discovered naked footprints in the moist earth of the plantain walk a little way beyond . She had proceeded but a short distance farther , when she came upon Alexander Smith lying face down , groaning feebly . She knelt beside him , and , putting her arms around him , lifted him to a sitting position with his head resting against her shoulder . He opened his eyes drowsily . " Jenny ? " he said . She examined him swiftly . The ball had entered at his shoulder and had come out at the neck . " Alex , could you walk with me to help ? " He nodded . With one arm around her shoulders , he struggled to his feet ,  | but they had gone only a few steps when his body went limp . With both arms around him , she held him for a moment and then let him sink gently down . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hutia . Smith was a solidly built man and it was all the three women could do to lift and carry him , but a quarter of an hour later they had him in Young 's bed . He was breathing heavily and had lost much blood . " It is a clean wound ; the ball has passed through , " said Taurua . " The great artery has not been touched  --  that is certain . Otherwise he would be dead . " The women worked quickly and in silence . Susannah carried water while Taurua and Jenny staunched the flow of blood from Smith 's wound and bound it well . He - vas now unconscious and his face ghastly pale . Hutia kept watch by the door and Prudence by the window . The sun had set.and the shadows began to deepen in the room . " They left him for dead  --  that is clear , " said Jenny . " Did Minarii know that he still lives , mad with killing , as he now is , he would come and club him as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and we must be prepared if they come here . I shall go now for Balhadi . Keep watch , you two . If you see any of them coming , cover Alex at once with the tapa mantle as though he were dead and kneel all of you by the bed , wailing and crying . They will believe and not molest you . When Balhadi comes she can be prepared to gash herself with a paohino . Seeing her face streaming with blood , they will be sure to think her man dead . " " The plan could not be better , " said Jenny . " Make haste , Taurua ; we shall do as you say . Balhadi must lose no time in coming . " Taurua set out for Christian 's house . It was a lonely way between the two dwellings , with ancient forest trees overarchingthe path . She had gone about half the distance when she heard her name called , and halted . Nanai came out fromp205behind a screen of bushes and beckoned to her , earnestly . Taurua went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her to speak . Nanai was deeply agitated , but controlled herself . " Hate me if you will , Taurua , for what my man has done this day , " she said , " but believe , if you can , what I say : I knew nothing of their plans , and Moetua is as innocent as myself . " " I am willing to believe it , " Taurua replied , " but this will not give life to murdered men . Speak quickly if you have more to say , for I have little time to spend here . " " Your man lives . . . " Taurua grasped her by the arm . " You know this ? Where is he ? " " On the Goat-House Peak , hidden in a spot where they will never be able to find him . It was I , Taurua , who told him of the place and led him there . " Taurua gazed at her searchingly . " We have long been friends , " she said . " You would not deceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes filled with tears . " You are like my own sister , Taurua , and Ned has been as a brother . Ask your heart if I could act basely toward you . But this I ask in my turn . If Ned is spared , he must put thoughts of revenge from his heart . Tetahiti is my husband . " " Though he and those with him were killed , the dead cannotbreathe again . I can not promise that his word will be given , but I shall do what I can to bring this about . " " It is enough , Taurua . Minarii is terrible in anger , but the desire for killing is short-lived . Ned has only to remain hidden . His life will be spared . Tetahiti will wish it  --  of that I am sure . Moetua and I will stand with you all in this . " " Alex is badly hurt . We have carried him to our house . We know nothing of Christian . "  | " Listen , Taurua . Moetua is close by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can help him if he still lives . Whatever has happened , I will bring you word when we know . Do what can be done to soften the hearts of the others toward us two . What our men have done is done . That can not be forgiven , but let them know that Moetua and I are blameless . " " That I shall do , " Taurua replied , " but keep well aloof from them until a later time , and most of all from these three  --  Jenny , Hutia , and Prudence . Their men have been murdered by your husbands . Their anger toward you can be understood . " " They shall not see us , " Nanai replied . " Now I must hasten to Maimiti , " said Taurua . " Go , and good go with you for your kindness to me . " Nanai clung to her for a moment ; then she turned and disappeared in the shadows of the forest . Balhadi had seen Taurua approaching . She came quickly to the door and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Balhadi , this I believe , " Taurua was saying . " I would not tell you so if I thought there was no hope . But do as I have said if Minarii or the others come . Cover Alex as you would cover a corpse , and all of you wail over him as for one dead . They will believe and not molest him . " A moment later she was alone in the room . She went to the door of Maimiti 's bedroom and halted there , listening ; then she returned to a bench near the table , and seated herself , her chin in her hands , staring unseeingly out of the window . Her eyes brimmed with tears , and for a time she wept silently . Presently she heard Maimiti 's voice calling Balhadi . Drying her eyes quickly , she entered the room where the mother was lying . " Balhadi has gone to her house , Maimiti . " " Oh , is it you , Taurua ? Christian has not come ? "  | " Not yet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no need . I love this dim light of evening . Such a good sleep I have had ! Look , Taurua , how she sucks ! She is like a little pig . Where can Christian be ? He told me he would come early in the afternoon , and here it is past sundown ! " " He will come soon . " " Go up the path to meet him , dear . He must surely be coming now . What a strange father he is ! You would think he had a little daughter born to him every day ! Go quickly , Taurua . Tell him to hasten . " Taurua nodded and turned hastily away . She stood for a moment outside the door gazing up the path now barely discernible in the dim light of evening . A moment later she seated herself on a bench there and buried her head in her arms.  |p208IN  the rich little valley between Ship-Landing Point and the easternmost cape of the island , Tetahiti and Nihau lay in the fern where they had slept , conversing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set long since , but the first faint grey of dawn was in the east . Nihau sat up , shrugged his shoulders , and spat . He began to count on his fingers . " Nine muskets we have ; fourteen were landed from the ship . Five are missing , though Young may have taken that which always stood in Christian 's house . " Both men started and seized their weapons at the sound of a footfall close by , but relaxed at a low hail from Minarii . He was followed by Te Moa , who carried a bunch of ripe plantains on his back . He set down the fruit , as well as four drinking nuts fastened together with strips of their own fibrous husk , and Tetahiti reached into the fern behind him for a basket of baked yams . They ate quickly and in silence . When the meal was over , Tetahiti remained for some time deep in thought . " Minarii , " he asked , will you not consent to spare Young ? Quintal and McCoy must be hunted down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must die ! Speak no more of this ! They must all be killed , and quickly ! " " Where can the others be ? " said Nihau . " Wherever they are , they shall not live to see the end of this day . " Minarii rose , taking up his musket as he spoke . " Go withp209Nihau and search the western slopes , " he went on . " Waste no more powder at long range . With Te Moa , I shall comb this end of the island , so that a rat could not escape our eyes . Let us meet a little after nightfall in the thicket close to Quintal 's house . " Minarii beckoned to his follower , and led the way up to the head of the valley and across the ridge . It was a stiff climb and both men were panting as they skulked along the ridge to the brink of the curving cliffs called the Rope . " Their feet made no sound on the rocky path , and , though the stars were only beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of bush warfare . He halted in a clump of pandanus at the very edge of the cliff . " I had not thought of this place , " he said to Te Moa in a low voice . " Keep watch while I scan the beach below . It will soon be day . " He set down his musket and stretched himself out at full length to peer down the dizzy face of the precipice at the narrow strip of beach many hundreds of feet below . Though the morning was windless , a southerly swell had made up during the night , and great seas came feathering and smoking into the shallow bay , to burst with long-drawn roars that seemed to shake the solid rock . The spray of the breakers hung in the air , oftentimes veiling cove and beach from the eyes of the watcher above . Sea fowl wheeled and soared before their nesting places . The light grew stronger . Presently the sun 's disc broke the horizon to the east . Peering down through a tangle of thorny pandanus , Minarii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder to the other man . " I see him ! " exclaimed Te Moa in a whisper . " There by the big rock ! Ah , he is gone ! " " Who is it ? " " I could not tell for the drifting spray . " Minarii reached for his musket , measured the distance with his eye , and shook his head . Some time passed before Te Moa whispered rapidly : " Look ! At the eastern end of the sands ! " " McCoy or Young , " said Minarii . " Quintal is a span wider in the shoulders . " The fog of salt spray closed in again ; when it dispersed , the man or men on the beach had disappeared . Minarii backed away from the verge of the cliff and crouched in the pandanus thicket . " What think you ? " he asked . " Your eyes are younger than mine . Are there two , or one ? " " Two , I think . Quintal and McCoy . " " Perhaps . Yet one man might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Whether one or two , they are trapped , " said Te Moa . " No man could climb the cliffs nor enter those breakers and live . " " And safe from us , " remarked Minarii , musingly . " This sea is a miti vavau , sprung from a distant storm . It made up quickly and will calm down as fast . I will keep watch here . Go you to the landing place and lash the outrigger on our canoe . Go softly . When the work is done , hide yourselfnear the path at the top of the bluff . If the swell goes down , I will hasten across to you . If not , we shall meet as appointed , near Quintal 's house . " When Te Moa was gone , Minarii settled himself to watch . He lay as immobile as the basalt crags of the ridge . Twice during the hours of the morning he had glimpses of a figure below , but the swell grew heavier as a south wind made up ; the cove was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind-driven spray . The sun reached its zenith and began to decline . In spite of the south wind , it was warm in the shelter of the scrub . Minarii grew drowsy as the afternoon advanced . He was stifling a yawn when his quick ear caught the sound of a footstep not far off . He took upp211his musket , cocked it noiselessly , and turned his head to peer out through the matted leaves . Twenty yards to the west , the low scrub parted and Matthew Quintal stepped out into the open , glancing this way and that . He wore a knotted handkerchief on his head , and a pair of trousers cut off roughly at the knee . His eyes were bloodshot and his great arms crisscrossed with scratches beneath the growth of coarse red hair . He came to a halt , crouching to avoid showing himself against the sky line , and began to gaze intently at the ridges and hillsides to the westward , one hand shielding his eyes from the sun . Firearms  --  even bows and arrows  --  were regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race , and Minarii hated Quintal so fiercely that he yearned to kill him with his bare hands . He set down the musket softly beside his club , and stepped out of the thicket , a look of sombre rejoicing in his eyes . Flexing the huge biceps of his left arm , he smote the muscle a resounding blow with his right hand ; the native challenge to combat . The blow rang out like a pistol shot . Quintal spun on his heel ; then he rushed toward Minarii . They came together crouching , with their hands low . Minarii feinted and lashed out with his right fist , a mighty blow that drove home smacking on the other 's jaw . Only Quintal 's great bull neck saved him ; he blinked , staggered , and rushed in under the native 's guard , seizing him beneath the arms in a hug that might have cracked the ribs of an ox . Minarii grunted as he was lifted off his feet ; next moment he drove his thumbs deep into his enemy 's throat . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up sharply , and as the other released his grip and staggered back , grunting with pain , the white man sprang on him and brought him to the ground . They grappled , twisting fiercely as each strove for a throttling hold on the other 's neck . Then suddenly , as they had fallen , they were up again , but this time Quintal had his left arm braced on the native 's chest , and a grip on Minarii 's great sinewy right wrist . A breath too late , the warrior realized his danger . As they turned in a half-circle , his battering fist rained blows on Quintal 's head , but the Englishman held on doggedly , exerting all of his enormous strength . Next moment , with a loud snap , the bone broke . Gruntingwith pain and anger , Minarii wrenched himself free and got in a blow that caught Quintal unaware . His head flew back ; as he stood swaying with vacant eyes , the native 's uninjuredhand shot up under his chin and closed on his throat . Both men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were fighting in the thorny pandanus scrub on the very brink of the cliff . With huge fingers sunk in his enemy 's neck , Minarii dragged him toward the precipice . Dazed , throttled , and in great pain , Quintal reached up feebly , felt for a finger , and bent it back with all the strength that remained to him . As the clutching hand at his throat let go , he struggled to his feet . At that moment Minarii aimed a mighty kick at his chin . Had the toughened ball of the warrior 's foot found its mark , the fight would have been over ; but , as it chanced , the crumbling rock on which he stood gave way . He staggered , waving his left arm in an effort to regain his balance . The white man sprang forward , seized the upraisedfoot of his enemy , and hurled him backward . Quintal craned his neck and saw the warrior 's body reboundfrom a crag a hundred feet down , crash through a thicket of dwarf pandanus standing out horizontally from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fetch up against a stout palm-bole , five hundred feet below . The Englishman was scarcely able to stand . One eye was swelling fast , he was scratched and bruised from head to foot , and his throat bore the red imprints of the dead man 's fingers . He swallowed with difficulty , coughed , spat outp213a mouthful of blood , and felt his neck tenderly . Then , after a long rest with head in his arms , he set out at a limping shuffle , across the ridge and down into the valley to the west . Only the bent and torn pandanus leaves and a sprinkle of blood here and there on the rocky ground bore witness to the combat . The sea fowl still soared before their eyries on the Rope , with the afternoon sun glinting on their wings . The sun went down at last behind the western ridge , and the bowl of the Main Valley began to fill with shadows . In the thick bush , well back from the settlement , Tetahiti and Nihau were making their way cautiously toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had searched the western half of the island , without a glimpse of the men they sought . Tetahiti was in the lead . He halted as they came to one of the paths that led inland ; then he seized Nihau 's arm and pulled him back into the bush . Next moment Moetua came into view . She was unaccompanied . Tetahiti called to her in a low voice : " Moetua O ! " As she turned , he beckoned her to follow him into the bush . " Where is Minarii ? " she asked . " With Te Moa , searching for the white men . " She was nearly of his own stature , and now she looked him squarely in the eyes , without a smile . " Tetahiti , " she said earnestly , " have you not had enough of killing ? Will you spare none ? " " All must die . Those are your husband 's words . Have you seen Quintal or McCoy ? " " No . As for Young , if I knew where he was concealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders . " I am of the same mind , yet Minarii is right ; it is the white men or ourselves . None shall be left alive . " " Blood ! Blood ! " she said in a low voice as she turned away . " Men are wild beasts . To-day I hate them all ! "  | Te Moa was awaiting them at the rendezvous , an area of unfelled bush not far from Quintal 's house . He told Tetahiti of what they had seen at the Rope , and of the chief 's instructions to him . " Here is food , " he said . " You two are weary and I have done nothing all day . Sleep when you have eaten . Minarii will soon be here . I will keep watch and arouse Nihau when I can stay awake no longer . " Prudence and Hutia sat close together on the floor of Mills 's house . The smaller girl caressed , from time to time , the head of the sleeping baby on her knees . The door opened softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightquaver : " Ovai tera ? " " It is I , Jenny ! " She closed the door and felt her way across the darkened room . " Listen ! " she whispered rapidly . " Our chance has come ! Have you courage to seize it ? " " Courage for what ? " asked Prudence coolly . " To kill the slayers of our men ! " Prudence rose , set down her child on a bed , and came back to Jenny 's side . " Now tell us what is in your mind . " " I have found Tetahiti and Nihau and Te Moa asleep . Te Moa lies with his back to a tree at some little distance from the others . His musket is between his knees . They must have posted him as a sentinel , but sleep has overcome him . We have an axe and two cutlasses . Are your hearts strong ? Will your arms not falter ? " " Not mine ! " said Hutia grimly . " I claim Nihau , " remarked Prudence , in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and Tetahiti is mine ! " Hutia slapped her knee softly . " Eita e peapea ! I will bear my part , so that the three die . . . . But Minarii , where is he ? " " He may come soon , " said Jenny . " We must make haste ,  |p215The  moon will set before long . Take the cutlasses and let me have the axe . " They rose and took up their weapons . Prudence bent over her sleeping child for a moment before she left the house . An hour passed and the moon hung low over the western ridge . Quintal was making his way down toward the settlement . He walked with a limp , slowly and cautiously , keeping in the shadows of the bush . Passing the blackened platform of stones where Minarii 's house had stood , he began to reconnoitre the thicket which separated him from the cleared land surrounding his own deserted house . He was about to emerge into the moonlight when he caught his breath suddenly , halted , and whispered : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the severed head of Te Moa , and turned the face to the moon . McCoy 's old cat , fetched from Tahiti , was a great night wanderer in the bush . He rubbed his back against Quintal 's leg , turned away , and began to lap at something on the ground . Fiercely and noiselessly , with his bare foot , Quintal kicked him away . He glanced this way and that , walked to a tree that stood at a few yards ' distance , and came to a halt before the bodies of Tetahiti and Nihau . " All dead ! " he muttered . " And a good job , too ! Who could ha ' done this ? " With three muskets under his arm , Quintal now took the path to the settlement . The candlenuts were alight in the house of Mills , but the windows and doors were barred . Quintal whistled softly outside , and after a moment 's pause Jenny called , " Who is it ? " in an uncertain voice . He made himself known . Presently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prudence was on the floor , suckling her child ; Hutia started to her feet nervously at sight of him . " Where is Minarii ? " asked Jenny , closing and fastening the door.  | " Dead . I killed him . What Englishmen are dead ? I found Jack killed by a musket ball , and the headless bodies of Martin and Mills . " Jenny told him briefly all that she knew , and he asked : " Where is Will McCoy ? " She shook her head . " Who killed the men I found yonder in the bush ? " he went on . The three women exchanged glances , and at last Jenny spoke : " If I tell you , will you keep the secret ? Parau man ? " " Aye ! " " They were the murderers of our husbands , " said Jenny slowly . " We killed them as they slept . " Quintal blinked bloodshot eyes as his slow mind consideredthis information . " Damn my eyes ! " he exclaimed . " Women 's work , eh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was our right and duty to kill these men . But their wives may have other thoughts . They must not know the truth . There has been trouble enough on this unhappy land . Will you tell the others that you killed those three ? " " Aye , if you wish it ; why not ? " " You will tell no one , not even Sarah ? " " No . Where is she ? " " At Young 's house . " Prudence covered her breast and laid the sleeping child on Mills 's bed . " We are glad to have you here , " she remarked . " We feared Minarii , and the spectres of the newly dead ! " Quintal limped across to Mills 's bed-place and lay down . Hour followed hour while the three women whispered nervously and lit fresh tapers of candlenuts . At last the stars paled before the light of dawn . When the last of the fowls had fluttered down from the trees , Hutia slipped out of the house . Jenny was moving about in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-leggedp217stool by the door , grating coconuts . Presently the basket was full and she stood up . " Pe ! Pe ! Pe ! " she called , ringingly , while the fowls began to run with outstretched wings , increasing their speed as the girl flung out handful after handful of the crinkled snow-white flakes . She upturned the basket , dusted her hands , and entered the house . Quintal still slept heavily , face turned to the wall . Prudence bent over her child , her lips caressing the cool little forehead . She took a comb of bamboo from the shelf above the bed , seated herself on the doorstep , and began to undo the long and heavy plait of her hair . Shaking her head impatiently , she raised a hand to dash the tears from her eyes . Mary and Sarah were approaching the house , leading McCoy 's children and Quintal 's boy . As Prudence glanced up , Sarah asked , " Where is he ? " " He still sleeps . " Without rising , she moved a little to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood before her , her eyes red with weeping . McCoy 's two children clung to the folds of her kirtle . " Has Matt seen my man ? " Prudence shrugged her shoulders . She felt only contempt for this soft , unready woman who became hysterical when it was time to act . Sarah was kneeling at Quintal 's side . He turned uneasily and opened his eyes . His two-year-old son was trying to climb on to the bed . ' The father 's eye brightened and he smiled . " Up , Matty ! " He lifted the child to his side . " There 's a stout lad ! Eh , Sarah , old wench ! " " Where is McCoy ? " she asked . " Dead , like enough . We must search for him . " He rose , stretching his muscles gingerly , limped out through the back door to the water barrel , and dashed ap218calabash of water over his head . His injured leg had stiffened during the night , and he found it next to impossible to walk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fetched him a breakfast of half a dozen ripe plantains . He ate halfheartedly , for he was only beginning to realize the full extentof the catastrophe . Will McCoy dead , no doubt , and Christian , too . And Jack Williams . . . old John Mills . Murdering bastards , those Indian men . Damn their blood , why could n't they have kept the peace ? Alex Smith would probably die , from what the women said . Quintal drew a deep breath and raised his head . The woman beside him leaned forward at sight of his gloomy face . " Ye must help me , " he said , " I can scarce walk . There ' s naught to hurt ye in the bush ; take Mary and make a search for Will . The children can stop with me . " " Where shall we search ? " " Try the eastern cape . Let Mary follow the ridge west above Tahutuma . If ye do n't find him , there , work down the Main Valley . He may be living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chance . " Sarah nodded as she rose , but Mary would not go until Jenny agreed to accompany her . Sarah set out to the east , while the other two crossed the Main Valley to the ridge . The sea had calmed during the night . The sun was about an hour up and the morning cool and cloudless . Sarah glanced fearfully this way and that as she walked . Now and then she stopped and hailed : " Will ! Will 0 ! Will McCoy ! " but for some time her clear hails died away without a response in the morning calm . When she had turned inland and was gazing down over the broad wooded bowl of the plateau , she heard a faint rustle in the bushes and a hoarse voice . " Sarah ? Are ye alone ? " " Yes . " " Duck down off the sky line ! Where ' s Matt ? "  |p219McCoy  was close to her now , and she started as the leaves were pushed aside and his haggard face appeared , ugly with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildly at her , as though doubting her word . " Where ' s Matt ? " he asked again , in a low voice . " At the house . Come back with me . They are all dead . " " Who are dead ? " " All of the Maori men . " " And the Englishmen ? " " Come back with me . Quintal will tell you . " " Are ye speaking truth ? " " Yes ! " replied Sarah impatiently . Some rat or lizard made a slight rustling sound among the dead leaves a few yards off . McCoy gave a violent start and peered about him in terror . The shirt and ragged trousers he wore were wet with salt water . He scrutinized the woman suspiciously . " Fetch Matt . I ' 11 believe it when he tells me . " Sarah shrugged her shoulders wearily . " There is nothing to fear . Yet I will fetch him if you wait . " " Be off ! " When she was gone , he moved cautiously through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendezvous without being seen . While McCoy awaited the coming of his friend , Taurua was walking rapidly along the western side of the plateau , toward Christian 's yam plot . From time to time she called softly : " Moetua ! Nanai ! " At last , in a thicket near the steep path leading to the ridge , she found those she sought . The two girls sat by a litter of purau saplings lashed with bark . Christian lay on this rude couch , ghastly pale and with a stubble of black beard on his chin . His eyes were closed ; only his rapid , shallow , and laboured breathing showed that he lived . Moetua and Nanai sat cross-legged by the stretcher , moistening bits of tapa with cool water from a calabash and laying them on the wounded man 's forehead . His fever , perilously high , dried the cloths fast . Moetua looked up at the newcomer with the slight smile courtesy demands of her race , but the sight of Taurua caused her to rise instantly . " What is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hervoice . Nanai stood up , twisting her hair hastily into a knot andscanning Taurua 's face anxiously . " Aye , speak out ! " she said . The other girl cast down her eyes and drew a long breath . " I would that another might have told you , " she said slowly . " I am the bearer of ill tidings . ... " " Speak ! " commanded Moetua . " Your husbands . . . both are dead , and Te Moa and Nihau . " Moetua 's face turned pale . After a long time she said , " The gods have forgotten . There is a curse on this unhappyland . " Nanai stood with bowed head . The taller girl put a hand on her shoulder , and turned to Taurua once more . " Who killed Minarii ? " " Quintal has killed them all . " " Young had no hand in it ? " " No . " Moetua 's eyes were full of tears as she looked Taurua straight in the face . " You are sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taurua turned away and sank down on her knees beside Christian . " The fever consumes him , " she said to Moetua . " We must carry him to Young 's house . " " Go back to Maimiti . We will fetch him down , " said Moetua . When she was gone , the two girls sat for some time in silence , with bowed heads and stony eyes . At last Moetua rose and made a sign to Nanai to take up one end of the litter.  |p221Carrying  their burden easily , and still in silence , they took the path to Young 's house . They found Young with Balhadi in the room . Alexander Smith lay in the bed on the seaward side , unconscious and with closed eyes . Though he had lost much blood , his face was flushed with fever . Balhadi sat beside him on a stool . She looked up at the sound of footsteps outside the door . Without a glance or a word of greeting , the two girls carried the litter into the room , set it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian 's unconscious body on to the fresh spread of tapa . Young rose as they entered and was about to speak when he caught sight of Moetua 's face . Still without a word , she turned and beckoned Nanai to follow her out through the door . Young crossed the room hastily to Christian 's side . He listened to the wounded man 's breathing , opened his shirt with gentle fingers , removed the dressing of native cloth , and examined the wound . As he rose from his knees his eyes met Balhadi 's anxious glance . " Can he live ? " she asked . " He must ! " he replied , in a low voice . " He must and he shall ! "  |p222THE  American sealing vessel Topaz was steering west-bysouthwith all sail set , before a light air at east . The month was February and the year 1808 . Her captain , Mayhew Folger , was one of the first Yankee skippers who were beginning to round the Horn , venture into the Spanish waters off the American coast , and steer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search of sealskins , whale oil , or trade . The Topaz was ship-rigged , and , although small , she had the sturdy weather-beaten look of a vessel many months outboundand well able to find her way home . The coast of Peru was now more than a thousand leagues behind her and she sailed a sea untracked by any ship since 1767 , when Captain Carteret 's Swallow had passed that way . When Folger had taken the sun 's altitude , at noon , he went below to make his calculations and to dine . Turning to go down the companionway , he caught the mate 's eye . " Keep her as she is , Mr. Webber , " he said . The mate was an Englishman of thirty , or thereabout , with a clear , ruddy complexion and an expression firm , reserved , and somewhat serious . He stood with arms folded , not far from the helmsman , glancing aloft from time to time to see that the sails were drawing well . It was midsummer in the Southern Hemisphere ; the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east wind , pleasantly warm . The ship rolled lazily to an easy swell from the northeast . Two bells sounded , and shortly afterward the man in thep223crow 's nest hailed the deck . He had sighted land , distant thirty-five miles or more . A moment later the captain appeared , wiping his lips with the back of his hand and holding an old-fashioned spyglass which he extended to the mate . " Get aloft , Mr. Webber , and see what you make of it . " Folger strode the deck until the other returned and handed him the telescope . " A high , rocky island , sir , from the look of it . The bulk of the land is still hull-down . It bears sou'west-by-west . " " Hmm ! A likely place for seals , I should think . You can alter the course to steer for it . " When Webber had given the necessary orders , the captain addressed him once more . " A discovery , sure as I ' m a Yankee ! There ' s nothing charted hereabouts save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good hundred and fifty miles to the west . " The Topaz approached the land slowly , for the wind was dying to the lightest of light airs . At sundown the land was still far distant ; it was not until past midnight that the ship was put about to stand off and on . Shortly after daybreakthe land bore south  --  a small island , high and wooded to the water 's edge , with a heavy surf breaking all along shore . Captain Folger came on deck in the grey of dawn . As he was focusing his leveled telescope , the mate , standing at his side , gave an exclamation of astonishment . " Smoke , sir ! Yonder , above the bluffs ! " The captain peered through his glass for a moment before he replied . " Aye , so it is . The place is inhabited , without a doubt . I can see the smoke of four different fires . " He sighed as he lowered his glass . " Well , there go our hopes of seals  --  and half our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , apt to be hostile in this sea , "  | " Inhabited or not , " remarked the mate , " no boat could land on this side . She would be dashed to pieces . " " And all hands drowned , " Folger added , once more peering through his glass . " There ' s not a sign of a beach , and the coast is studded with rocks , offshore . . . . Bless me ! Here ' s some of ' em now ! Three , in a canoe ! " Webber 's unassisted eye soon made out the tiny craft , appearing and disappearing as it approached over the long swell . The ship was allowed to lose what little headway she had , and within a quarter of an hour the canoe was close by  --  a long , sharp , narrow craft , with an outrigger on the larboard side . Her crew backed water at a distance of about thirty yards from the Topaz , and sat , paddle in hand , as though prepared to flee back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They regarded the ship with looks of wonder and awe , not unmingled with apprehension . In spite of repeated hails to come on board , they neither spoke nor came closer for some time . The mate gazed at these strange visitors with the keenest interest , observing that they were lads , the eldest no more than eighteen or nineteen . If Indians , they were , certainly , lighter in complexion than any he had seen . Their faces were bronzed by a life in the open air , but scarcely darker than those of white seafaring men . The stern paddler , who wore a straw hat of a curious shape , ornamented with feathers , seemed somewhat reassured by his scrutiny . " You are an English ship ? " he called , in a strong , manly voice . " What in tarnation ! " Folger exclaimed under his breath . And then : " No . This is an American vessel . " The three youths looked at one another and spoke together briefly in low voices . " Who are you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where were you born ? " " On the island yonder . "  | " How can you be English ? " asked the captain . " Because our father is an Englishman , " came the quiet reply . " Who is your father ? " " Alex . " " Who is Alex ? " " Do n't you know Alex ? " " Know him ? God bless me ! How should I know him ? " The lad in the canoe regarded the captain earnestly , then turned to his companions again for another low colloquy in an unintelligible dialect . At length he said , " Our father would make you welcome on shore , sir . " " Come aboard first , my lads . You 've nothing to fear from us , " Folger replied in a kindly voice . The steersman glanced at his companions , and , after a moment of hesitation , they dashed their paddles into the water and drew alongside . A line was dropped to them and made fast , and the three young islanders swarmed on deck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , a smile on his kindly , weather-beaten face . " I am Captain Folger , " he said , extending his hand to the tallest lad , " and this is Mr. Webber , the mate . " " My name is Thursday October , sir . This is my brother , Charles , and this is James . " The spokesman , for all his youthful appearance , was a full six feet in height , and magnificently proportioned , with a handsome , manly countenance and a ready smile . All were barefoot , bare-chested , and bare-legged , and dressed in kilts of some strange cloth which reached to their knees . Their manner was easy and they showed no further signs of timidity , though they stared about them in round-eyed wonder at what they saw . " What a huge , great ship , sir ! " remarked Thursday October in a voice of awe . " We 've heard of them from our father , but have never seen one before . "  | The people of the Topaz were crowded as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interestedas those the three lads bestowed on the ship . " You shall be shown over her , presently , " said the captain , " but I want to ask you about your island , first . Is there a landing place on the other side ? " " Only one , and that dangerous . We land and embark in the cove yonder . " Folger glanced toward the land and shook his head . " Our boats could never risk it . You have plenty of fresh water here ? " " Yes , sir . " The captain pointed to the scuttle-butt , outside the galley door . " We ' ve a score of casks like that one . Could they be landed in your bay ? " " That would be easy , sir , " Thursday October replied , quickly . " If you would tow them to the edge of the breakers , we could swim them in , one by one . " " And you could fill them , once on shore ? " " Yes , sir ; though we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How long would it take ? " " Brown 's Well is the nearest water . " The lad thought for a moment , measuring with his eye the cask by the galley . " With all of us at work , I ' 11 warrant we could do it in two or three days . " " And you ' d be willing to lend us a hand ? " The lad 's face lighted up . " To be sure we would , sir ! There ' s a plenty of us ashore to help . " " Good ! Never mind the work , young man . You shall be well rewarded . Now the boatswain will show you over the ship , above decks and below . Keep your eyes open and choose what will be most useful to you . Within reason , it shall be yours for filling my casks . " As the three lads followed the boatswain forward , Captainp227Folger turned to the mate . " The weather has a settled look , Mr. Webber ; yet I do n't feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see that no time is wasted in filling the casks ? " Webber 's expression of pleasure was so transparent that Folger went on without waiting for a reply . " I envy you ! Who can they be ? There ' s a mystery here ; you must solve it . " " I ' m to go in the canoe , sir ? " " Yes , and you ' d best stay ashore until the work ' s done . We ' 11 tow the casks in with the longboat . Tell Mr. Alex , or whoever he is , that we ' 11 be off the cove , ready to work , by noon . " When the young islanders had finished their tour of the ship , they proved reluctant to make known their wants . Being urged , they at length informed the captain that a couple of knives , an axe , and a copper kettle would be more than ample compensation for watering the ship . Folger , who had taken a great fancy to the lads , gave them the kettle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen each of large clasp knives and axes . " And what style of man is Mr. Alex ? " he asked , as they were handing down their things into the canoe . " Is he tall or short ? " " Like yourself , sir , " Thursday October replied . " Short and strong-made . " Folger went below and returned with a new suit of stout blue broadcloth on his arm . " Take this to Mr. Alex with my compliments . " Thursday October 's eye lit up with pleasure . " God will reward you for your kindness , Captain ! We have no such warm clothes as these . Our father is no longer young and often feels the cold in the wintertime . " The three then shook hands warmly with Folger and the boatswain , waved to the others , and sprang down into the canoe , followed by the mate . A moment later they had cast off and were paddling swiftly toward the cove , now about three miles distant . Webber was seated amidships , and as they drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sixteenyear-oldlad who sat on the forward thwart . Never , he thought , as he watched the play of muscles on the paddler 's back and shoulders , had he seen a nobler-looking boy . His countenance , when he turned his head , had the open , fearless look of a young Englishman , yet there was something at once pleasing and un-English in his swarthy complexion , his black eyes , and the thick black hair falling in curls to his shoulders . They were close in with the land now , to the east of the little cove , where a huge rock , rising high above the waves , stood sentinel offshore . A bold and lofty promontory , falling away in precipices to the sea , gave the cove some shelter from the southeast winds ; the swell , rising as it approached the land , rushed , feathering and thundering , into the caverns at the base of the cliffs , each wave sending sheets of spray to a great height . The cove itself was studded with jagged rocks , black and menacing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first glance , that even skilled surfmen could effect a landing at such a place . The cove was iron-bound , save at one spot where Webber now saw a tiny stretch of shingly beach , at the foot of a steep , wooded slope . A score or more of people were gathered there , staring at the approaching canoe . To reach the shingle , Webber perceived , the little craft would have to be steered with the greatest nicety , through a maze of rocks that threatened instantdestruction . Yet the young paddlers seemed wholly unconcerned and approached with an air of complete confidence . They halted briefly on the verge of the breaking seas , and then , at a word of command from Thursday October , all three dashed their paddles into the water at once . A great feathering sea lifted the canoe and bore her forward as swiftlyp229as a flying fish on the wing . She turned , flashed between two boulders , and was swept high on to the little beach . Half a dozen sturdy lads rushed into the surf to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side to seize the gunwales , and with the next comber they carried her high up on the shingly sand . The little crowd on the beach , Webber observed with some surprise , was made up of boys and girls who might range from ten to eighteen years of age . Not a grown man or woman awaited the canoe . Where were the parents of all these youngsters ? Thursday October had said that they had never before seen a ship . It seemed remarkable indeed to the mate of the Topaz , if Alex , the father , were truly an Englishman , so long cut off from humankind , that he and the other adults should show so little interest in visitors from the outside world . The young people seemed shy , almost apprehensive . None stepped forward to greet the stranger ; they seemed rather to shrink from him , whispering together in little groups and regardinghim with bright eyes which expressed curiosity and wonder . The boys , like the three who had come out to the vessel , all wore kilts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same materials , and most of them wore chaplets of sweet-scented flowers . Some of the girls would have attracted attention anywhere , though their beauty was more of the Spanish than of the English kind . When they whispered together , they spoke in some jargon unknown to the visitor . The three paddlers now returned from a long thatched shed , well above high-water mark , where they had carried their canoe . The youngest , known as James , carried the suit of clothes , and now the boys and girls clustered around him , feeling of the cloth and exclaiming softly in wonder and admiration . Thursday October touched Webber 's arm . " Come this way , sir , " he said.  | The land rose steeply from the beach to the sloping plateau above , in a wooded bluff perhaps two hundred feet in height . A zigzag path led to the summit , and the lads and lasses were already trooping upward and were soon lost to view . Webber followed his guide , envying the agility of the lad , who strode along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his exertions and was obliged from time to time to cling to the roots of trees , bushes , or tufts of grass . At length they reached the summit , where the mate halted to regain his breath . The young islander then led the way along a wellfootedpath that followed the seaward bluffs , winding this way and that among great trees whose deep shade felt deliciously cool . After crossing two small valleys , or ravines , they reached a kind of village , consisting of five houses scattered far apart along a stretch of partially cleared land which sloped gently toward the sea . The houses were of two stories and thatched with leaves of the pandanus . They looked old and weather-beaten , but were strongly timbered , and three of them were planked with oak which Webber recognized as the strakes of a shipwrecked vessel . As they passed the first house he saw a dark , gypsy looking woman peering out at him , and , at another open window-place , a second , somewhat younger , with a handsome face and thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . He caught glimpses of several other women at the farther dwellings , but they were no more than glimpses . Faces vanished from view the moment he looked toward them . Presently they came to an ancient banyan tree on the seawardside of the path . Its huge limbs , from which innumerableaerial roots depended , like hawsers anchoring the tree still more firmly to the earth , seemed to cover half an acre or more . Directly opposite , on the inland side of the path at a distance of about thirty yards , stood a dwelling , delightfullypleasant and neat like all of the others , with a green/sward dappled with sunlight and shadow and bordered with flowers and flowering shrubs . A man of about fifty stood in the doorway . He was short and powerfully built , clad in the same strange cloth the others wore , but neatly cut and sewed into the form of frock and trousers , after the fashion of the old-time British tar . His grey hair fell upon his shoulders , and his features and the glance of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , " he said , stepping forward and extending his hand . " My name is Webber . I am mate of the ship yonder . " With a word of apology to the visitor , Thursday October now stepped forward and spoke rapidly and briefly to the old man , in the same curious jargon the mate had heard on the beach  --  a language in which certain words of English were discernible , but whose sense was unintelligible to him . Presently the old man dismissed the lad with a nod and ushered the Englishman into the house . " Dinah ! " he called . " Rachel ! Where are ye , lasses ? " Two little girls not yet in their teens appeared at the door , regarding the stranger with bright-eyed timidity . " Fetch some coconuts for the gentleman , " their father went on , " and what fruit ye can find . " The children dashed away without replying , while their father brought forward a chair . " Sit ye down , sir , and rest , and taste of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea , I take it ? " " Three months and more , " the mate replied . " Little we thought there was land anywhere hereabout . What is the name of your island ? " " It ' s Pitcairn 's Island , sir . No doubt ye ' ve been misled by the chart . Captain Carteret laid it down a hundred and fifty miles west of its true position . " " But he called it uninhabited , "   " Aye , so it was in his day .... Ye need water , the lad says . We ' ve plenty here , but it ' 11 be a three-day task at best to get it down to the beach . Can ye bide the time ? " " We 've no choice . Scarcely a spit of rain have we had since we left the coast of Peru . Most of our casks are empty . " " And what might your errand be in these parts ? " " We ' re a sealing ship , " Webber replied . " We were bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there seals hereabout ? In that case we 'd like well to fish here , if you ' ve no objection . " The islander shook his head . " Ye 'd have no luck , Mr. Webber . I ' ve seen a few of the animals on the rocks at rare times . The last was all of ten years back . " The old man fell silent , elbows on the rude table and chin in his hands . Webber had a slightly uncomfortable feeling that he was being studied and appraised . His curiosity concerning the inhabitants of this seagirt rock was so intense that once or twice he drew breath to put the direct question , but he thought better of it each time . His host was , plainly , a man of intelligence , who would realize how strange this little community must appear to a man from the outside world . If he had reasons for keeping silent , they should be respected . If willing to satisfy a stranger 's curiosity , he would do so in his own good time . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the islander at last . " Yes . But the ship is American . She hails from Boston , in New England . " The old man gave him a keen glance . " Say ye so ! " he replied . " Then there 's still peace between us and the Col-onies ? " " Aye , and a brisk trade , too . " The old man sighed and paused for a moment before he spoke . " Close on to twenty years I ' ve been here , Mr. Webber . Ye 're the first man to set foot on shore in all that time . " P233Webber looked up in astonishment . " Twenty years ! " he exclaimed . " Then you 've heard nothing of what 's happened in the world  --  of the revolution in France ; of old Boney , of Trafalgar , and all the rest ! " The children now returned , bringing drinking nuts and a dozen great yellow plantains in a wooden bowl , together with other fruits which were strange to the mate . He partookof them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , while he ate , narrated briefly the events of the stormy years at the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth . The old man displayed little interest in political happenings and battles on land , but the account of England 's naval victories brought a flush to his cheek and a sparkle to his eye . Yet all the while he seemed to labour under a baling and unnatural reserve , maintaining a silence concerning himself out of keeping with a countenance as frank and open as that of John Bull himself . The sun was high when Thursday October returned to escort the visitor down to the beach . " I ' d take it kindly , sir , " said the old man as he rose to his feet , " if ye ' d stop with me whilst the watering is done . Or will your captain come ashore ? " " He 'll want to stretch his legs before we leave , " the mate replied , " but he will remain on board till the work is finished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The islander laid a hand on his arm . " Put me out , Mr. Webber ? God bless ye , sir , never in the least ! Ye ' 11 be welcomed , and hearty , by one and all  --  that I promise ye ! " The longboat was towing the first of the barrels into the cove when the mate arrived at the beach . All the young people engaged in the task of swimming them in through the surf , shouting and sporting in the breakers , where they seemed as much at home as on land . Webber had never seen such swimmers ; they appeared and disappeared in the swirling white water among the rocks , guiding the great ,  | clumsy casks to the landing place , where they were beached without the slightest mishap . Soon all the first lot were ashore and rolled to a piece of level land that had been dug out of the hillside , while the longboat pulled back to the ship , now two miles distant . Toward the close of the afternoon , Webber went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the younger children as his guides . They led him first to a rock cistern in the depths of the valley and retired while he refreshed himself with a bath . No man could have asked for merrier companions , once their shyness had worn off . They brought him fruits and flowers , and spoke freely , even eagerly , of the trees and plants of the island , of the wild swine , the goats and fowls ; but , for all their childlike faith and trust in him , Webber was aware of the same reserve so noticeable in the man they called father . They seemed to be partakers in a conspiracy of silence concerning their history ; and it was silence the guest respected , however much his curiosity was aroused . Toward sunset he returned to the house where he had been bidden to sup and spend the night . He found his host seated on a bench outside the door with half a dozen of the smaller children seated on the grass around him . He was giving them an exercise in dictation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a copy so worn and well thumbed that it was falling to pieces . He read slowly , a phrase at a time , while the children , with lips pursed and chubby fingers clasped round their pencils ,  --  the blunt spines of a kind of sea-urchin ,  --  set down the words as he pronounced them . For slates they used thin slabs of rock ground smooth on both sides . " Avast ! " said the old man as he perceived his guest . " That ' ll do for to-day , children . Rachel , run and tell Mother we 're ready to sup . Come in , Mr. Webber . Ye ' ve an appetite , I hope ? I must tell ye , sir , ye ' ve filled my oldp235head so full of republics , and battles , and what not , I ' ve been woolgathering all the afternoon ! " As they were about to seat themselves at the table , a woman of forty or forty-five came in through the back door , bearing a large platter containing baked pig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plantains , all smoking hot . She had a pleasant homely face and the mate perceived at once that she was not of white blood . " This is Balhadi , Mr. Webber , the mother of the little girls yonder . " The mate stepped forward to greet her , and as he did so , his host spoke to her in the curious speech the islandersused among themselves . As soon as he had finished , she stepped forward and took the stranger 's hand in both of hers , caressing it as a mother might do , her eyes glistening with tears as she peered up at him ; then she turned and withdrew . The two men seated themselves , and when the old man had heaped their plates he bowed his head , and , quietly and reverently , asked God 's blessing on the food of which they were about to partake . Webber was a religious man in the fine sense of the word ; cant and snuffling were hateful to him , and he felt his heart touched and uplifted by the simplicityand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fading to dusk by the time they had finished the meal . While they were still at the table the mate had observed , through the open doorway , small groups of people turning in at the gateway and gathering on the grassplot before the dwelling . His host now led the way outside and for a few moments they remained seated on the bench by the door , looking on in silence at the scene before them . All the inhabitants of the island seemed to have assembled there . They sat in groups on the grass , speaking in soft voices among themselves . They were clothed in fresh garments and the younger women wore newly made wreaths of fern and flowers pressed lightly down over their loose dark hair . The visitor gazed about him with the keenest interest , thinking that he had never seen a group of healthier , happier-looking children . Counting them idly , he found that the young people numbered four-and-twenty , and seated among them were eight or nine women of middle age , the mothers , evidently , of this little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian blood . But where were the fathers ? With the exception of his host and himself , not a man of mature age was present . Presently the old man rose to his feet , and at a sign from him the older women came forward to greet the visitor . The first to take his hand was a tall and slender woman of forty ; the Englishman thought he had never seen a face at once so sad and so maturely beautiful . " Mr. Webber , " said his host , " let me make ye known to Maimiti , Thursday October 's mother . " She greeted him in a soft , low voice , making him welcome in a few words of English spoken with a strange accent , very pleasant to hear . Following her came a woman of commandingpresence , a head taller than the mate himself , whom his host introduced as Moetua . In her fine carriage , the poise of her head , most of all in the proud spirit that looked out of the dark eyes , Webber was reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some queen of the Amazons capable of performing deeds worthy to be handed down in the legends of primitive races . Next came four women with English names ,  --  Mary , Susannah , Jenny , and Prudence ,  --  although they were evidently of the same race as the others . It was Prudence whose handsomeface and copper-red hair he had admired at the window of the house he had passed on the way from the cove . These 3 were followed by three more with strange Indian names which he found it impossible to keep in mind . Some greeted him in silence , merely shaking his hand ; others spoke to him in the English tongue , though in a manner which revealed thatP237they were little accustomed to the common use of it ; but , whether silent or not , all made him feel , by the simple sincerityand kindliness of their manner , that he was indeed a welcome guest . Meanwhile , some of the younger people had brought a small table and two chairs from the house which they placed on the greensward , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Rachel with a kind of taper made of a dozen or more oily nuts threaded like beads on the midrib of a coconut leaflet which was stuck upright in a bowl of sand . The topmost nut was burning brightly , with hissings and sputterings , while a slender column of smoke rose from it , ascending vertically in the still air . The little companynow seated themselves on the grass before the table , and the murmuring of voices ceased . The old man turned to his guest . " This is the hour for our evening worship , sir , " he said . " We should be pleased to have ye join with us . " A chair was placed for the visitor at one side of the group , whereupon his host seated l imself at the table and opened his silver-clasped Bible , holding the volume close to the flickeringlight . He turned the pages slowly with his large , rough fingers . Presently , clearing his throat , he began to read . " I say then , Hath God cast away his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to his boyhood , twenty years before . His grandfather , a white-bearded yeoman farmer , had read a chapter from the Bible each evening , in just such a quiet , earnest voice , after the same admonitory clearing of the throat ; but how different a scene was this to the one he so well remembered in the north-country farmhouseof his childhood ! The old man read on , his finger slowly following the lines , while the members of his little congregation listened with an air of the deepest interest and respect . When the lesson was at an end , all knelt and repeated the Lord 's Prayer in unison , and as the guest listened to the voices of youths and maidens mingling with the clear , childish accents of the little children , he felt that here indeed was worship in purity of heart , in simple unquestioning trust in God 's loving-kindness toward His children . It was as though all felt His presence there among them . The service over , old and young came forward to bid the stranger good-night before dispersing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone , it seemed to Webber that his host looked at him with even more kindness and with less reserve than hitherto . " It 's plain that ye 've a great love of children , Mr. Webber , " he said . " Ye 've some of your own , I take it ? " " That I have ; three of them , the oldest about the age of the lad I had on my knee a moment ago . Whose child is he ? " " My own , though he 's living with his foster mother just now . .. . It ' s over early for bed , sir . Would ye relish a bit of a walk ? I ' ve a bench not far off , overlooking the sea . It ' s a pretty spot and the moon will be up directly . " He led the way along the path toward the cove , but turned off in a moment on another leading through the groves to a rustic seat placed at the very brink of the cliff which fell steeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I come here of an evening , Mr. Webber , " he explained , as they seated themselves . " Ye may think me fanciful , but there 's times when the breakers seem the very voice of God  --  comforting at a time like this , wrathful on a night of storm . . . . Look ! Yon she comes ! " The moon , a little past the full , was rising above the lonely horizon , flashing along the white crests of the breakers far below and glinting along the motionless fronds of the coconut palms . The islander turned to his guest , hesitated , and said at last :   " No doubt ye 've wondered at my not naming myself . Smith 's my name  --  Alexander Smith . " He watched his companion 's face closely , as though to divine what effect the mention of the name might produce . As there seemed nothing to say , Webber remained silent . " And ye must have wondered about other things , " the old fellow went on , after a long pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of land so far from any other . " The mate smiled . " I should have been more or less than human had my curiosity not been aroused . " His companion sat leaning forward , elbows on his knees , his hands clasped loosely , as he gazed out over the moonlit sea . " Ye ' re an honest man , that ' s sure , " he said , at length , " and a kind-hearted man . . .. I ' d never believe ye could wish harm to me and mine ? " " Harm you ? God forbid ! " the mate replied , earnestly . " Set your mind at rest there , my friend . I would as soon harm my own little family as this flock of yours . " " What happened , Mr. Webber , was long ago  --  more than twenty years back . ... " Of a sudden he turned his head . " Did ye ever hear of a ship called the Bounty ? " The words came to Webber like a thunderclap  --  like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment before . In common with most seamen of his day , he had heard of the notorious mutiny on board the small armed transport sent out from England to fetch breadfruit plants from the island of Tahiti to the West Indies . He remembered clearly the principal events in that affair . The fate of the Bounty and those who had been aboard her constituted one of the mysteries of the sea . The mate turned to his companion and said , with emotion in his voice , " Then you 're . . . " " Aye , " Smith interrupted quietly , " one of Fletcher Christian 's men , Mr. Webber . It was here we came . "   A hundred questions crowded into Webber 's mind , but his companion was now more eager still . " What can ye tell me of Captain Bligh ? " he asked , anxiously . " Was he ever heard of again ? " " Indeed he was ! He got home , at last , with most of his men , after the greatest open-boat voyage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand down resoundingly on his knee . " Thank God for that ! " he exclaimed , reverently . " Ye 've done me a great service , sir . Now I ' ll sleep better of a night . And the men we left on Tahiti ? What became of them ? " " I ' ve read a book or two on the subject , " Webber replied ; " and the tale is well known . A ship-of-war was sent out to search for the Bounty . Let me see ... Pandora , I think she was called . They found a dozen or fifteen of the Bounty 's company on Tahiti . The Pandora seized them and they were being taken home in irons when the vessel was wrecked off the coast of New Holland . A number of her company and several of the prisoners were lost , and the rest of her people were forced to take to the boats . They reached Englandnearly a year later , as I remember it , when the prisoners were tried by court-martial . Three or four , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening with an air of almost painful eagerness . " Ye do n't recollect the names of the lads was hung ? " he asked . Webber shook his head , as he was forced to do when his companion asked after numerous men by name . " I ' m sorry ; I can tell you the fate of none of them , " he replied . " Of the Bounty 's company I remember only CaptainBligh , and Christian , the officer said to have led the mutiny . " " It was Mr. Christian 's son , Thursday October , that brought ye ashore . " " And where is Christian , and the others who came withP241you ? As I remember it , there were a dozen or more in all . " " Nine , " said Smith . " That is , nine of us white men . Besides , there was six Indian men and twelve women that came with us from Tahiti . The women ye met this evening are the mothers of these lads and lasses . " " But where are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save me . " " You mean they 've gone elsewhere ? " Smith shook his head . " No . They ' re dead , sir . " The mate waited for him to proceed . The old fellow sat staring before him . At length he said : " Are ye a patient man , Mr. Webber ? Could ye listen to a story ' t would take me a couple of evenings to tell ? " " An account , you mean , of what has happened here ? " " Aye . " " I should like nothing better ! Why , man , there are scores in England would travel a hundred leagues to hear the tale from your lips ! Have no fear ! You 'll find me a patient listener , I promise you ! " " I 've no wish to tell it , God knows , " Smith continued , earnestly . " And yet , if so be as I could ... it would ease my heart more than I could well say . I 've little learning  --  that ye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's happened here . Ye shall have the truth , Mr. Webber . I ' 11 keep nothing back , but I 'll ask ye to bear in mind that the Alex Smith who speaks is not the Smith of the Bounty days . " Well , sir , to begin at the beginning ... " As he listened , the mate of the Topaz was lost to the present moment . He felt himself carried , in an all but physical sense , into the past . In place of Alexander Smith  --  stout , middle-aged , and fatherly  --  he saw a rough young seaman in the midst of as strange a company as ever sailed an English ship . He was conscious of the heave of theP242Bounty 's deck beneath his feet , of the hot suns , the wind and weather of bygone days . He found himself looking on at old unhappy scenes , sharing the emotions and hearing the voices of men long since dead  --  voices that had broken the silence of this lonely sea and still lonelier island , nearly twenty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeded , on the following evening ) . Aye , if ye recollect , Mr. Christian and me was lying wounded in the house . Save for what I learned afterwards , I can tell ye nothing of the time that followed . Ye can fancy the state the women was in . Moetua and Nanai went off into the bush by themselves after they 'd fetched Mr. Christian . Jenny and Taurua stopped with Mrs. Christian , who kept asking for her husband and wondering why he did n't come back . Ye 'll recollect that she 'd been brought to bed of a daughter on the morning the killing began . Hutia stopped with Balhadi to care for us . Mr. Christian had lost so much blood , he lay quiet as a dead man . I 'd a high fever ; for three days without a let-up , they told me , I babbled , and cursed and raved . The rest of the women , with McCoy 's children and little Matt Quintal and Eliza Mills , gathered in one house . They was that dazed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ' d not had the little ' uns to think on . They sat huddled on the floor the day long , with scarce a word exchanged , some of ' em crying softly with heads covered , as Indians do . The days was bad enough ; it was the nights they dreaded most . They 've strange notions , not like ours . They reckon that the spirits of the new dead , no matter if dear friends or husbands in life , are fierce , ravening things , hating the living . Of a night , the women in Mills 's house would bar every door and window , and huddle with the children by their candlenut torch , quaking at every little sound outside .   Quintal stopped alone at his place , sitting on the doorstep most of the time , with his chin in his hands , and he 'd speak to no one . I ' ve no notion what was going on in his mind . It may be he felt the loss of Mills and Jack Williams , or was thinkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how he 'd brought the trouble on by burning Minarii 's house . The killing started at dawn , as ye know . September twenty-second , it was , 1793 , a date I 'll not forget . The last of the Indians was killed on the night of the twenty-third . Next morning , when Moetua and Nanai was gone , Taurua came across from Mr. Christian 's house to speak to my old woman . She told her Mrs. Christian was in such a state it was all they could do to keep her in bed . It was agreed by all she ' d have to be told . Mr. Young said , long afterwards , he 'd as soon face the hangman as live through that morning again . They tried to soften the news to Mrs. Christian , but she guessed what they held back . Up she got , in her kirtle , threw a mantle over her shoulders , took up her newborn babe , and went out the door without a word . When they reached our house , she went straight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes was closed and his fever was high . Hutia took the child , and his wife settled herself at the head of the bed-place to keep the cloths on his forehead wrung out cool and fresh . Ye know what a shock the like of that will do to a woman . Mrs. Christian 's milk had begun to flow strong and good that morning ; by nightfall her breasts was dried up . When the baby cried , Balhadi fed it on what the Indians call ouo , the sweet jelly they scrape out of young coconuts . Aye , and she throve on it ; for the next year she 'd naught else . All that night , through the next day and the night following , Mr. Christian and I lay there , tended by the women and Mr. Young . He 'd told Mrs. Christian what had happened ; P245after that she scarce spoke a word . It must have been the morning of the third day when the fever left me and I opened my eyes . Here I was in my own house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder and my neck was all stiff and sore . When I tried to move , it pained me cruel . My head was light from the fever and it was a good bit afore I could set my thoughts in order . It came back slow  --  how Jenny ' d come to my taro patch , how I 'd climbed the Goat-House , hoping to meet up with Mr. Young , and hid myself alongsidethe path in the Main Valley , on the chance of cutting down one of the Indians and getting his musket . Towards sunset I 'd crept down to Mr. Young 's plantain walk , for l ' d had naught to eat all day . Then I recollected Te Moa , and Nihau , with Mills 's head at his belt , stepping out sudden as I was reaching up for some ripe fruit , and the shot that knocked me down ; how I 'd scrambled up and made a run for it ; then something to do with jenny , and no more . Three was killed , she 'd told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My bed-place was on the north side of the room , by an open window . It was a calm , sunny morning , with scarce enough breeze to move the tree-tops . Here and there , where the screen of bush was thin , the sea showed blue through the trees . Beautiful , it was , and peaceful ; ye ' d never have thought men could plot murder in such a place . I set my teeth and turned my head the other way . I saw someone on the other bed , across the room , but could n't make out who it was . Mrs. Christian sat on the floor beside him with her back to me , and I could see neither her face nor his . He never moved , and I took a notion he was dead . Taurua and my old woman was feeding a tiny baby on a mat , and Mr. Young stood near by . I called out to him . Balhadi sprang up , baby and all ; and Mr. Young came across to me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God ye ' re better , now the fever 's down ! " My old woman tried to smile at me , and nodded with a hand on my head . " Who ' s that yonder ? " said I. " Mr. Christian . " " Is he living ? " " Aye . " Mrs. Christian came over and spoke to me kindly . When she 'd gone back to sit by Mr. Christian , I had a glimpse of his face . One look was enough . There 's no mistaking a dying man . Mr. Young signed to Balhadi to take the baby away , and sat on a stool close by . " Ned , " I whispered , " tell me what 's happened , else ye 'll have me in a fever again . " When he had , I lay there thinking on it and wondering what the outcome ' d be . It was a black business . Ye wo n't wonder I felt bitter toward Quintal and McCoy . They 'd done more ' n anyone else to bring on trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant this island to be a little Garden of Eden , and we 'd made a hell of it . Mr. Christian had done all a man could . Now he lay dying for his pains . Knowing him as I did , I reckoned he 'd be glad to go . We 'd had our chance , and we ' d failed . Why ? It was n't the Indians ' fault ; they 'd had cause enough for what they 'd done . I thought of Tetahiti , who 'd been my friend ; and of Minarii  --  both high chiefs on their own I islands . Because their skins was n't white , McCoy and Quintal and Martin and Mills reckoned they was n't fit to own land . I went back to the beginning , to the day we landed here , trying to make out how we 'd got on the wrong course . No , it was no fault of the Indians . All the men asked was to be treated like men ; they ' d have been our best friends had we met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' d travel far to find a better lot . Real helpmates , they was , ready to take their share in all that was going . And noneP247o ' your sour , scolding kind . We was to blame , and no one else . In the first place , we should have seen to it , afore ever we left Tahiti , that each man had his girl , with some to spare . That might have kept Williams out o ' mischief . Might , I say , for ye could never tell with a man like Jack . He and his precious Hutia was the start o ' the trouble . But it was bound to come , girls or no girls . There was them amongst us reckoned the Indians was made to be used like dogs . That ' s the first and last of it , sir , in few words . I slept most of the morning . I felt a deal better when I woke up again , and grateful just to be alive . Maimiti was still at the foot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her face would have melted a heart of stone . All at once I saw her eyes light up ; she came quickly and softly to the head of the bed and knelt down beside him , taking his hand . The fever had left him and he was conscious . He looked at her in a puzzled way at first . " What 's this , Maimiti ? " said he . " Where are we ? " " In Ned 's house . " She fetched him some water , and I could see by the look in her eyes that hope was springing up in her . He drank a little and said no more for a bit ; then he asked , " Is Ned here ? " Mr. Young was at the door . He came in and stood at the foot of the bed . He did n't trust himself to speak . " What is it , Ned ? What has happened ? " " Do n't worry or try to talk just now , " said Mr. Young . " Where is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the other Indian men ? " " All dead . " Mr. Christian turned his head slow on the pillow and saw me . " Are ye hurt , Smith ? " " Aye , sir , but not bad , " said 1 . His voice was stronger when he spoke next .   " Ye must tell me the whole of it , Ned . I want to know . " There was no getting out of it . Mr. Young told him , quick and short . However he felt , he gave no sign ; just lay there , a-starin ' up at the ceiling ; then his eyes closed , and Mr. Young tiptoed out o ' the room . Mrs. Christian never moved from her place at the foot of the bed , where she could watch his face . She was blind to what I could see . Trust a good woman to hope . It was afternoon when he came round again and drank a little of the water she offered him . Then a long time passed without a word said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October came to the door . He was three at the time , and ye never saw a handsomer little lad . He 'd a finger in his mouth as he stood in the doorway , looking into the room with his round eyes . At last he came in on tiptoe , half afraid , even after he 'd made his father out . Mr. Christian turned his head and saw the little fellow . Desolate , his face was ; such a look as I hope never to see another man wear . " Take the child out , " said he . His wife took up the lad and set him down outside the door . She was gone for a minute or two ; I think it took her that long to get herself in hand . The afternoon wore through . Balhadi fed me a bit of sweet coconut water now and again . I could look out the window , as I told ye . A fine breeze had made up ; the trees was swaying , and there was whitecaps out at sea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian was conscious this while , but lie spoke no more than a word or two . He knew he was dying , most like , and felt glad to go . All he ' d touched was ruined , he 'd be thinking : the Bounty 's voyage , the men set adrift with Captain Bligh in the launch , those who ' d stopped on Tahiti , and now our little settlement , where he 'd hoped for so much . Aye . . . I 'll warrant there was never a man waited his end withP249greyer thoughts than Mr. Christian . My heart bled for him . The breeze died away after sundown , as it often does here . I do n't recollect a stiller , more beautiful evening . It was spring in these parts , as ye ' 11 remember , and the twilight came on slow . Mrs. Christian gave her husband a sip of water , set down the cup , and stopped where she was , seated on the bed beside him . He put a hand on hers and looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slow . " Alex , " he said . " Sir ? " When he spoke again it took me by surprise , and I 'm not certain of the words to this day . He said , " There ' s a chance , now , " or " There ' s still a chance "  --  one or the other . He seemed to expect no reply , so I made none , but lay there trying to make out just what he meant . If he ' d said , " There 's a chance , now , " the words was the bitterest ever spoke , for he must have meant that with him dead and out of the way there might be hope for us . I can scarce believe he spoke so , but it may have been . After a long time I heard his voice again : " Never let the children know ! " and those was the last words I heard him say . I must have dozed off then , and when I opened my eyes it was dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hopeless cry that woke me . I could n't see her , or Mr. Christian , but I knew the end had come . P250THE month that followed was a sorry time , with the silence of death over all . I was afeared , at first , that Mrs. Christian might lose her reason . She was n't one to weep , and that stony kind of grief ai n't natural in a woman . Tears would have helped but none came . It made my heart sore to see her going about the house with that dazed , dead look on her face , like as if the truth had n't come home to her yet . And there was nothing ye could do to help . She had to fight it through alone . Sometimes a whole day 'd pass without her speaking a word . Aye , it was a numb , hopeless time for all , and I 'll never forget how lonesome it seemed with so many gone . There was one , Martin , I 'd have had no wish to see back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was better dead ; but the others , whites and Indians alike , was sore missed , and most of all , of course , Mr. Christian . We could see better , now , the man he 'd been , and the deep need we had for him . There was no one could take his place . We was like sheep without a shepherd . Mr. Young was the hardest hit of any of the men , I reckon ; ye 'd scarce believe the change that came over him . He 'd sit on the bluffs for hours at a time , lookin ' out over the sea , or wander about the settlement like a man walkin ' in his sleep . There ' d been no one fonder of a joke in the old days , but after Mr. Christian 's death I never again heard him laugh . My bein ' hurt and needin ' a bit of care was a help to him . When Maimiti or Balhadi was n't settin ' by me , he was , andP251I ' d try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future  --  how we 'd divide ourselves up , now , amongst the houses , the new gardens we ' d make , and the like . He ' d try to show interest , but it was plain he had no heart for anything . But Mrs. Christian would n't give in , and having the children to see to and the other women to comfort was a godsend to her . Little by little she became more like her old self , and she ' d hearten the others with her quiet ways . I do n't know what some would have done without Maimiti . One day when she and Mr. Young was by me in the house , she spoke of Moetua and Nanai . Ye ' 11 mind that they was the wives of Minarii and Tetahiti . They ' d not been near the settlement since the day they brought Mr. Christian down , but lived by themselves in Jack Williams 's old house on the other side of the island . Some believed they must have known their men meant to kill all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a massacre amongst the womenfolkif it had n't been for Maimiti and Taurua ; they knew well enough that Moetua and Nanai had naught to do with it and was as innocent as themselves . Well , Mrs. Christian asked Mr. Young to go across and coax ' em down , if he could . " Tell ' em to come for my sake , Ned , " said she . All the women liked Mr. Young ; they 'd do anything he said . Inside of an hour he was back , and they with him . He came in first and they stood at the door . Ye ' ve seen Moetua , sir ; ye can picture what she was in her young womanhood . I 've seen thousands of Indian women , whilst on the Bounty , on islands scattered all over this ocean , but none to match Moetua for strength and beauty . She was like a young oak tree . I ca n't say better than that she was a fit wife for Minarii . It 'd done my heart good just to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Prudence and Hutia or all the womenfolktogether that kept her away from the settlement at thisp252time . She ' d have been more than a match for the lot of ' em . But she knew Quintal had killed her husband , and she was afeared she might take her revenge on him . She 'd not his great brute strength , but , with the fire of hate in her heart , I 'll not say she could n't have mastered him and put him to death . Nanai had a softer nature . She was of the best Indian blood : ye could tell at a glance the difference there was between her and women the like o ' Jenny or Hutia . She was gentle . She needed someone to cling to , and it was a blessing she had Moetua , after Tetahiti was killed . Half crazed as some o ' the women was , after the killing , I reckon they might have found a way to murder Nanai if she had n't been with Moetua . As I ' ve said , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw ' em , Maimiti came across and took ' em by the hands and brought ' em in . " Moetua , " said she , " what our men have done is done . It may be that your husband killed mine ; now both lie dead . Nanai , Christian and Tetahiti were friends . We have been like sisters in the past . I have nothing but love in my heart for ye two . Will ye come here and live with me ? " I can tell ye what was said , but not how it was said . Never a woman lived with a more kind , gentle nature than Mrs. Christian . Moetua took her in her arms and held her close . She had a beautiful husky voice , near as deep as a man 's . " Aye , that we will ! " said she . Then the three of them wept together , with their arms round each other . Glad I was to see that meeting . It was the first time Mrs. Christian had shed tears . As soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I ' d let her have my house and move over to hers . I knew how it was with her : she ' d a terror of setting foot in the house where she and Mr. Christian had lived . So we moved down there  --  my old woman , and Hutia , and Prudence , who was to livep253with us . Mr. Young took Mills 's house , with Taurua and Jenny . Quintal and McCoy stopped where they always had , with their own two girls and Susannah . My wound healed slow . I was able to walk by the end of October . But it was close to Christmas before I had any use of my left arm . I was good for little this while and had to stop indoors . It was a quiet time , but desperate lonesome , as I ' ve said . Quintal and McCoy kept clear o ' me , and I was glad they did , for my heart was bitter towards both . I knew we 'd mostly them to thank for bringin ' trouble to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cared if I ' d never set eyes on either of ' em again . Ye ' d have said , sir , that God had give us that time to mind us of the past and the mistakes we ' d made , and to make sure of our ways for the days to come ; but some of us was too ignorant to profit by it , and the rest too weak or stubborn . I 'm speakin ' of the men . What followed was no fault o ' the women . Them that went our ways did it because we led ' em or forced ' em to it . I 've spoke of McCoy 's still . He had it going long afore the killing started , but he was that close about it not even his crony , Matt Quintal , knew what he was up to . There 's no better way to show ye what a sly clever man Will McCoy could be . On this mite of an island , where there was so few of us , he ' d been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and none of us knew . It was n't till later I learned all that went on . McCoy had been shook bad by the days he was in the bush with the Indians after him . A time or two they all but had him ; they ' d passed within a few feet of where he lay hid , and he 'd seen Mills 's bloody head , and Martin 's , hangin ' at their belts . Aye , he 'd been near daft with fear , and , when all was over , the women who went in search of him could n't coax him back to the settlement . He ' d not even believe Mary , his own girl , and it was n't till Quintal came and showed him the Indians ' dead bodies that his mind was set at rest . Then off he went again , no one knew where . Quintal was crazed himself , in a different way . There 'd always been something a little queer about Matt ; I 'd noticed it in the old days on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and again something he 'd say or do would show ye the man was n't quite right in his head . The trouble got worse , after the killing . He ' d set on his doorstep muttering to himself , the women said , and act so queer , most of the time , they was afeared of him . For all that , he began to work about his place again , chopping wood , doing a bit o ' weedin ' in the gardens , and the like . Then it came over him , of a sudden , that McCoy had quit the house . Slow and dogged , Quintal began to search for him , and found him at last in one of the gullies on the west side of the island . McCoy had made him a hut , close by his still , a dry , cozy little place with a soft bed of fern inside . " So this is where ye hide out ! " said Matt . " What 's come over ye , Will , and what 's all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have to tell , and he was glad , in a way , that Quintal ' d found him . " Set ye down , Matt , " said he . He pulled a bottle out of the fern , and a pewter half-pint he had by him . " Taste that , " said he , and he poured him out a big dollop of spirits . Quintal took a sniff and then poured it down . " It ai n't bad , not by a long way , " said he ; " but what is it ? Where ' d ye get it from ? " " I made it , " said McCoy , " out o ' ti roots . " Then he told Quintal how it was done . They got the Bounty 's big copper kettle . The other McCoy had was too small to make spirits for more than one ; with the big one they could brew any amount and set some of it aside to age . A new still was set up , and so new trouble started . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was noticed , of course , that they ' d be off together somewheres , but the womenfolk was glad to have ' em gone , and took no thought of what they might be up to . After a few weeks they ' d bring their grog to the house , and they teached their girls and Susannah to drink with ' em . It was n't long till Prudence and Hutia took to goin ' there of an evening , and sometimes even Jenny would go . That ' s how I first got wind of it . I ' 11 say this for myself , sir , and it ' s the one right thing I did in all that time : I tried to hold Hutia and Prudence back , at first . But they ' d found that grog could make ' em forget the troubles we ' d had . Once they knew that , there was no keepin ' ' em away from McCoy 's house ; but the women I ' ve spoke of was the only ones that ever touched the stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One evening before I was able to get about much , Mr. Young came in to see me . He was like a new man , and it was easy to guess where he ' d been . " Alex , " said he , " I ' ve brought ye what will do ye a world of good . " " What ' s that ? " said I , knowing well enough what it was . He ' d a bottle under his arm , which he set on the table . " Will McCoy ' s sent this along to ye , with his hearty good wishes , " said he ; " and it ' s grand stuff , Alex . Ye ' d scarce know it from the best London gin . " " Ye ' ve had a good sup already , Ned , " said I. " That ' s plain to be seen . " " I have so , " said he . " Where ' s the sense of our holding out against a tot o ' good grog now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we lead here . God knows a little good cheer wo n't harm us . " ' " Ned , " said I , " I ' 11 not say I do n't wish I had a cag o ' the same , but have ye reckoned what this might lead to ? Ye ' ve never seen Quintal in his cups . I have . He ' s the devil himself ! "  | " He was quiet and pleasant as ye please to-night , " said Mr. Young . " That may be , " said I. " There ' s times when he ' s harmlessenough ; but ye never know when he ' 11 be the other way . " Quintal or no Quintal , " said he , speakin ' a little thick , " I ' m for the grog ! I ' ve not felt like this in months , lad . My idea is that a little o ' this  --  seamen 's rations , mind ye , like we had in the old days  --  will harm none of us . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked at me in a sober way , and got up from his chair . " God forgive me , Alex ! " said he . " If ye wish to abstain , I ' d cut off my right hand before I ' d be the one to urge ye ! " He grabbed up the bottle and was about to go , and , fool that I was , I begged him to set down again . I ' d been away from spirits for so long , I could just as well have kept off it ; and I knew how it would be once I started again . No seaman ever loved his rum more than myself . I ' d been used to it from the time I was a mere lad , and words ca n't say how I coveted a share o ' that bottle . Well , sir , the long and the short of it was that I fetched a couple of half-pints and a calabash of water , and between us we finished the whole bottle . And Mr. Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ' d been low-spirited enough , but after a few drinks everything was bright and sunny . Balhadi looked on at the two of us , pleased as anything to see us so cheerful again . At this time none of the womenfolkknew the harm there was in drink . In years past there ' d been a spree or two in the bush , but these they ' d not seen , and for the most part we ' d drunk our grog rations from the old Bounty 's supply quiet and peaceable till all was gene . So the womenfolk , bein ' ignorant , made no fuss at all , at first , about the still . Most would n't drink because they could n't abide the taste o ' spirits , but they did n't mind us doing it.  |p257As  soon as I was able to get about , I took to joinin ' the others at McCoy 's house . At first there was no harm in any of us . We ' d agreed each man was to have his half-pint a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start , because we had n't enough to make up a half-pint around , but that was soon mended . We ' d never worked harder in the old days than we did now at clearing land for ti-planting . Quintal and me took charge o ' that , and Mr. Young and McCoy minded the still . They soon had a cag o ' spirits set by to age and started filling another . We hunted the island over for wild ti roots whilst them we ' d planted was coming along . The food gardens was left to the womenfolk . Ye can guess what followed , sir . We was young seamen , save Mr. Young , and the eldest of us scarce five-and-twenty . As soon as there was a good store of spirits set by , no more was said about half a pint a day , though Mr. Young held fast to that at first . The rest of us drank as much as we ' d a mind to , and the five girls with us . There was Sarah Quintal , and McCoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke of  --  Susannah , Hutia , and Prudence . These last had no men o ' their own , and the grog made ' em as wild and hot-blooded as ourselves . Ye ' 11 not need to be told how it was with us . We took no thought o ' wives or anything else . There was trouble a-plenty afore many weeks . Mrs. Christianwas n't long in seein ' the truth o ' things . She ' d come to Mr. Young and me and beg us to leave off for the children'ssakes if for naught else . And we ' d be shamed to the heart and promise to do better ; but , a few days after , back we 'd go and all would be as before . It got so as Mrs. Christianand the other decent women would have naught to do with us . She gathered the children away from McCoy 's house , and she fitted bolts and bars to her house , well knowingwhat a dangerous man Quintal was , at times , when he was drunk . One night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop him , he near killed Sarah . She and Mary bothp258had more than enough bad treatment . They ' d have been only too glad to leave the house , but did n't dare to , for fear o ' what their men might do . So it went with us for another three months ; then a thing happened that brought even such brutes as we 'd become to our senses . The four of us men was at McCoy 's house , drunk as usual , with Prudence and Hutia and Susannah . Mary and Sarah had got to the place where they was more afraid to stay than to go , and Mrs. Christian had taken ' em in at her house . Quintal had been of a mind to fetch ' em back , but the rest of us had talked him out o ' that and got him quieted down . McCoy did n't mind Mary going , for he still had some decencyin him and he knew she ' d be best away with the children . I came stumbling back to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She ' d stayed by me all this while , and Taurua had done the like by Mr. Young , which only goes to show how patient and long-suffering good women can be . But they was near to the end of their patience , as I ' m about to tell ye . It seemed to me I ' d scarce closed my eyes when I was shook awake by Balhadi . " Quick , Alex ! " said she . " Rouse the others and come ! Quintal ' s just gone by toward Maimiti 's house ! He means mischief ! " I set out at a run for McCoy 's house and roused him and Mr. Young , who was sleeping there . Before we ' d come halfway back , we heard Quintal batterin ' at the door of Mrs. Christian 's house . The sound of it sobered us , I can promise ye ! The moon was about an hour up . Quintal was at the door with a fence post he ' d picked up , and all but had it battered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him , but he gave no heed . We could hear the children crying indoors , and then Mrs. Christian 's voice , cool andp259quiet . " I 've a musket here , " said she . " I ' 11 shoot him if he sets foot inside . Stand away , ye others ! " McCoy was the only one of us who could ever manage Quintal with words . He ran up now and took hold of his arm . " Matt , are ye mad ? " said he . Quintal turned and gave him a shove that threw him clear across the dooryard . " I want Moetua , " said he . I dragged him back , and Will was at his legs and Mr. Young tried to hold one of his arms . The three of us was no match for him , and that ' s the truth . Then the women took a hand . Balhadi pitched in with us ; then what was left of the door was broke down and out came Moetua . Hating Quintal as she did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers round his throat and would have killed him if it had n't been for Maimiti . We tied him up and carried him , half dead , back to McCoy 's house . That was the last straw for the women . Even Prudence and Hutia left us , wild young things that they was in those days , and they took Susannah with ' em . They joined the others at Mrs. Christian 's house . We ' d bound Quintal hand and foot , so he could n't move , and had to keep him so all the next day , for he was like a wild animal . Nothing we could say would quiet him . That same morning , Balhadi went down to Mrs. Christian 's and was gone till afternoon . There was a scared , sober look on her face when she came back . I noticed it , though I was still muddled and sleepy with the drink I ' d had . She ' d a mind to tell me something ,  --  I could see that ,  --  but she held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with it , whatever it was . The fact is , I was ashamed and disgusted with myself , thinking how I ' d used Balhadi all these months , and I was short and surly with her to hide how I felt . Around the middle of the afternoon I told her to fetch me a bite to eat , which she did . When I ' d finished I lay down for a nap , andp260having had no sleep the night before , I did n't wake till daylight the next morning . Balhadi was nowhere about . It was a day of black squalls , makin ' up out of the southeast , with hot calm spells betwixt ' em . I went to the edge of the bluffs , as I always did of a morning , for a look at the sea and sky . While I was there , a squall came down so sudden I ' d no time to run to the house , and squatted in the lee of a clump o ' plantains , takin ' what shelter I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was looking out to the eastward when I saw something afloat about a mile offshore . For all my bleary eyes , it looked like a capsized boat . I rubbed and looked again and made out what I thought was people in the water alongside , and some up on the keel . I ' d no notion of the truth , but ye ' 11 know the start it gave me to see a capsized boat , with men clinging to it , in this lonely ocean . In all the years we ' d been here we ' d sighted but the one ship I ' ve told ye of . I scanned the horizon all round , as far as I could see , for the ship this boat belonged to , but there was none in view ; then I ran to McCoy 's house to get the spyglass . Him and Mr. Young was there , still asleep . I shook ' em out of it and the three of us hurried down to the lookout point above the cove . Ye know how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it jumps right up to your eye . What I saw was our cutter , upside down , and all our womenfolkaround it , some swimming , some clinging to the boat as best they could , while they held their little ones up on the keel . Ye ' 11 know the shock it gave us  --  such a sight as that . Even with it there before our eyes , we was hard put to believe it was real . We ran back to McCoy 's house to fetch Quintal . He was snoring fit to shake the place down . We pulled him out of the bed-place tryin ' to waken him . " Rouse him out of it , " said I to Will . " Kick him awake somehow !  |p261Let  him know young Matt ' s out there like to drown ! " Then Mr. Young and me ran to the cove . We dragged the biggest of the canoes down into the water . By good luck there was no great amount of surf and we was soon beyond it . We made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Afore we was half a mile out , another black squall bore down on us  --  solid sheets of water , and wind fit to blow the hair off your head . It passed , quick as it had made up , and there was the cutter , not a cable 's length off . Had the girls been women from home , more than one of the children would ha ' been drowned that day ; but these knew how to handle themselves in the sea . Prudence and Mary came swimmin ' to meet us , and passed up their babes afore they clambered aboard . Next minute we was alongside , and took little Mary from Mrs. Christian . Then the older ones they had on the keel was passed over to us . McCoy and Quintal was on the way by this time in the other canoe . Quintal was in the stern . He made the water boil and no mistake ! " Is Matt safe ? " he yelled when he was still a quarter of a mile off . " Aye , safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Mary was in our canoe , with their two little ones , half drowned , in her lap , and I ' 11 not forget the look on Will 's face when he saw ' em . We was takin ' the other women on board , Mrs. Christian the last . The two canoes held the lot of us . We took the cutter in tow and made for the cove . Some of the women was weeping , but not a word was spoke all the way . Mrs. Christian sat on a thwart with little Mary in her arms . She ' d a look of hopelessness and despair that ' 11 haunt me to my last day . We ran the breakers and got the women safe ashore , and them with the children hurried on to the settlement . The others helped us get the cutter righted and bailed out and back in the shed . We had no words with ' em or they with us . We was too shocked and sobered by what they ' d tried to do to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye believe it , sir ? They ' d meant to sail off with the young ' uns in that bit of a cutter ! Mrs. Christian understoodthe compass , and they minded some low islands we ' d passed in the Bounty on the way from Tahiti . That ' s where they was bound , if so be as they could find ' em . Unbeknownstto us , Mrs. Christian had got ' em together , provisionedthe cutter , and set sail to the north . Had they not made the sheet fast and capsized in a squall , they ' d all ha ' been lost , as certain as sunrise ! But this ' 11 show ye how desperate they was . They was sickened to the heart 's core of men , and they ' d come to hate the island where there ' d been so much bloodshed and misery . We ' d drove ' em to the point where they ' d sooner chance death by drowning , or thirst and starvation , than live with us and have their children brought up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening the four of us got together , but not to drink . It was McCoy himself that spoke first . " Mr. Young , " said he , " I ' m done with it ! I know how much blame falls to my share in all that ' s passed . I 'll be the cause o ' no more trouble . We ' ve children and good women here . I ' m for a decent life from now on . " " I ' m with ye , Will ! " said I , standin ' up , " and there ' s my hand on it ! " We was all of a mind , Quintal as hearty and earnest as the rest . There was to be no more distilling , that was agreed on and swore to , and we went to our beds sober and peaceable for the first time in many a day . Aye , we thought we was turning a new leaf that evening . There was to be naught but peace and quiet in the days to come.  |p263Now  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a time I do n't like to think about . I said I ' d tell ye the truth of what ' s happened here , and so I will , but ye ' d not want to hear the whole of it . There ' s little to be said about those years save that we went from bad to worse . Not all at once . For two or three months after the womenfolk tried to leave the island we kept our word , and not a drop of spirits was touched . We did try , the four of us , to make a new start ; then it was the old story over again : our solemn promises was broke , and the end of it was that Maimiti left the settlementwith her three children and went over to the Aute Valley to live , and Moetua and Nanai went with her . They built a house with no help from any of us , and not long after , Jenny and Taurua , Mr. Young 's wife , joined ' em , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . I was glad they did . The settlement was no place for children , that ' s the truth of it . Balhadi had stayed by me all this while , hoping I ' d come to my senses , and Mary had done the like by McCoy , but little heed we gave to either of ' em . Four of the women  --  Hutia , Susannah , Prudence , and Sarah , Quintal 's girl  --  stayed on with us , for the most part , and we lived together in a way it shames me to think of . Mr. Young made one with us in this . Ye ' 11 wonder he could have done it . He was a gentleman born . How did it come he could join with men the like of Quintal , McCoy , and myself ? My belief is he ' d lost all heart and hope , seein '  | . how things went . He was never a man to lead . He must have thought we could never be made to go his way , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself for doing it . Never have I seen a sadder face than Mr. Young 's at this time . It was a blow to him when Taurua left to join Maimiti , but he did n't change his ways . He took to drinkingharder than ever , like as if he wanted to kill himself . For all that , he was a gentleman in whatever he did . I knew well enough it was only the grog that made him able to abide the rest of us . So things went till the end of 1797 . I mind me well of a spree we had in the fall of that year . We ' d started by killinga pig and making a feast . There was the four of us and the women I ' ve spoke of . It happened that Jenny and Moetua had come down to the settlement that day . They found us in a carouse that was the worst , I reckon , we ' d ever had up to that time . McCoy recollected that it was four years to the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men was killed . He was so drunk he cared for naught , and he told the women we ' d made the feast to mind us o ' that . Then Quintal made him brag before Moetua , who ' d been Minarii 's wife , about how he ' d thrown her husband over the cliff at the top of the Rope . I was far gone in drink myself , then , and I 've no doubt I did my part to make the women hate us the more . I 've little recollection of what happened after , but I know the women was horror-struck at our brute ways . There was fighting ' twixt Quintal and McCoy and some o ' them , but I was too drunk to take part in it . I was awake early next morning and found I ' d climbed to the loft , somehow . Mr. Young was asleep on a bed on the other side of the room . I went down the ladder and found Quintal and McCoy sprawled out on the floor , and a precious-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his body , and he had every stitch of clothing torn off him . Quintal'sp265face and beard was smeared and caked with blood from a deep gash on his head ; one of the women must have given him an awful knock . The benches and tables was upset , and glass from broken bottles was scattered all over the floor . I went along home for a bit , but there was no one about , or in any of the other houses . I went on to Mr. Christian 's old place where Prudence and Susannah lived at this time . Maimiti had never set foot there  --  or in the settlement , for the matter of that  --  since the day she ' d moved to the Aute Valley . The Bounty 's chronometer was at Mr. Christian 's house . He ' d kept it going from the time the ship was seized from Captain Bligh to the day he was killed . Mr. Young minded it after that , till he took to drinking so hard ; then I ' d looked after it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never allowed to run down . I do n't know why I did it , for time meant nothing to us and we ' d the sun to go by . Likely it was because the clock was a link with home and minded me of the days before we ' d brought so much misery on ourselves . Anyway , I never missed a day in windingit , and I took charge of Mr. Christian 's calendar . He ' d said to me once : " Alex , if anything happens to Mr. Young or me , see that ye keep my calendar going ; else ye wo n't know where ye are . " Ye might have . thought the four of us would sober up now , after such a spree as we ' d had , but it was n't the way with us then . We was at it again all that day , and the next , but on the third morning I ' d had enough . It was then I began to suspicion something was amiss with the womenfolk . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing left to eat in the house save a bunch of plantains . Quintal and McCoy and me made out a meal with ' em , and I carried some up to Mr. Young , who was lying down in the loft . He always kept to himself as much as he could . He ' d come down now and again , but he said not a word more than
