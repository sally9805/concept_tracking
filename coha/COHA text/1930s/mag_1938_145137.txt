Readers of the diary of Samuel Pepys know the intimate scenes that pop out so unexpectedly among the humdrum entries on office work and financial difficulties- such passages as Pepys 's account of his shamefaced spying on his wife Elizabeth when he thought she was too friendly with her dancing teacher , his love affair with Mrs. Bagwell after he had got her husband a job , with pert Betty after he had married her off to simple Mr. Martin , his adventures with Doll Lane , Jane Welsh , Elizabeth Whittle , Frances Tooker , and various maids who were briefly employed in the Pepys household . But not so many readers know that Pepys 's famed diary has never been published in an unexpurgated version . For the last eight years , in the Pepys Library at Magdalene College , Cambridge , Librarian Francis McDougall Charlewood Turner has been making a new transcript of the six volumes of the Pepys diaries , including the " indelicate " passages which previous editors left out . <P> Not content with the protection of his cryptic shorthand when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screens by making up a pidgin language of French , Spanish and Latin , with toy words and a freakish kind of lustful baby talk . " She would not suffer that je should poner my mano above ses jupes which je endeavoured , " he wrote of one modest soul . But although Librarian Turner transcribed such passages , Pepys 's secrets are still reasonably safe 270 years after the night Mrs. Pepys caught him with the charming Deb Willet . Talking things over with publishers and college authorities , Librarian Turner decided that the new edition too should be expurgated . <P> After studying Pepys for eight years , his " admiration for the man has grown into something very like affection . " For Librarian Turner , publishing Pepys 's secrets would be like betraying the confidences of an intimate friend .
