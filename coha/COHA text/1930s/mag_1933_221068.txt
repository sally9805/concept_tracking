" The soldiers and the Sheriff 's men are expected to defend these prisoners with their lives . Any man who defies them may expect to forfeit his life . I have no tolerance for mob spirit . " <P> Crosses had been burned at nearby Scottsboro and Huntsville , hotheads had met in a room near the courthouse the night before ; the scrubby little town of Decatur , Ala. was darkly restless when Judge James E. Horton thus warned its citizens one morning last week . He had sent the jury from his courtroom during his speech . Now he called them back and proceeded with the sensationalized trial of bullet-headed Haywood Patterson , first of seven young Scottsboro blacks accused of raping two white girls , Victoria Price and Ruby Bates , in a freight gondola two years ago ( TIME , April 10 et ante ) . <P> Twice-married , sullen Victoria Price was star witness for the State . It was up to Defense Counsel Samuel S. Leibowitz of Manhattan , engaged by the International Labor Defense but no Red , to break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence that she had been convicted of bootlegging , vagrancy , adultery . The night before the alleged gondola rape , testimony of one of Counsel Leibowitz 's Negro witnesses indicated , she had lain in a Chattanooga hobo camp . <P> Mrs. Price made a truculent witness for the defense . There was much that she " disremembered . " She did not know how old she was . " I ai n't that educated that I can figure it out . " Her prime taunt was to challenge the defense to produce her missing friend , Ruby Bates , and " ask her about it . " <P> Surprise . After the State had rested . Counsel Leibowitz announced he would call as a witness one Lester Carter . Surprised indeed was the prosecution at Witness Carter 's appearance . He swore that Victoria Price had taken Ruby Bates to visit him when he was working in a chain gang near Huntsville . He said that after he was released , he took the two girls to Chattanooga . They were bumming their way back to Huntsville when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , were not molested . <P> Shock . No sooner had Witness Carter stepped off the stand than the Defense announced : " We will call Ruby Bates . " Now the prosecution table buzzed with excitement . Judge Norton stepped down off his bench , walked to the rail enclosure as the young woman , clad in new " store clothes " and escorted by an elderly social worker , shuffled through the courtroom door . Victoria Price panted angrily . <P> Ruby Bates proceeded to repudiate her testimony at the Negroes ' 1931 trial . She said : " I told it just like Victoria did because she said we might have to stay in jail if we did not frame up a story after crossing a state line with men . " <P> The witness then told a strange story of her movements since she vanished Feb. 28 from her Huntsville home . She said she had gone to New York to see Dr. Harry Emerson Fosdick , in whose Rockefeller-built Riverside Church choir two Negroes sing . In New York , Preacher Fosdick said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I , as a clergyman , advised her to tell the truth . She promised me that she would go back to the second trial and do so . "
