Last week mice-breeding Biologist Clarence Cook Little of Bar Harbor , Me. , published in the American Medical Association Journal facts about the inheritance of cancer which mice taught him . Fundamentally , they proved that the tendency to cancer is inherited , just as are brown eyes or curly hair . Cancer can be bred out of a family by marriages into noncancerous families . <P> Inheritance of cancer of the breast does not follow genetic rules . Men whose mothers or maternal grandmothers had this type of cancer rarely transmit the tendency to their daughters . To daughters of women who have had cancer of the breast Dr. Little gave this advice : " Virginity delays the appearance of cancer of the breast and also actually reduces the amount of it appreciably . "
