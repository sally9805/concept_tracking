Homes , tractors and typewriters are sold in the belief that they will not soon change owners . Automobile salesmen , however , have the fervent hope that after a year or so the buyer will return for a newer , shinier , faster and perhaps more expensive model of the same make . Charles Franklin Kettering , President of General Motors Research Corp. , lately wrote : " . . . Our chief job in research is to keep the customer reasonably dissatisfied with what he has . " <P> Last week the automobile industry faced 1930 with the opening of the New York Automobile Show . Although 1929 was a record smasher with 5,700,000 cars made ( estimate by Standard Statistics ) , it was , as all the world now knows , a turbulent and unhappy one for the manufacturers . Customer dissatisfaction during 1929 failed to keep pace with offerings . To the trials of overproduction have now been added the hazards of a possible business recession . <P> For these reasons the motor makers awaited the New York show with more than usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their new offerings , knowing well that without popular fancy 1930 may be a disastrous year for any company . <P> Show . In the Grand Central Palace salesmen hovered around the glistening models , representing 44 different U. S. makes , and two foreign cars . In addition to passenger cars , two taxis were displayed . Also there were exhibits of accessories and shop equipment . The U. S. makes , with approximate minimum price of cheapest models , were : <P> Under $1,000 <P> Auburn ( $995 ) Hupmobile ( $995 ) <P> Chevrolet ( $525 ) Nash ( $915 ) <P> Chrysler ( $985 ) Oldsmobile ( $875 ) <P> De Soto ( $845 ) Peerless ( $995 ) <P> Dodge ( $925 ) Plymouth ( $665 ) <P> Durant ( $635 ) Pontiac ( $745 ) <P> Elcar ( $995 ) Roosevelt ( $995 ) <P> Erskine ( $860 ) Studebaker ( $995 ) <P> Essex ( $725 ) Whippet ( $525 ) Graham ( $855 ) <P> Between $1,000 and $2,000 <P> Blackhawk ( $1,995 ) Oakland ( $1,145 ) <P> Buick ( $1,225 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( $1,695 ) <P> Hudson ( $1,095 ) Willys-Knight <P> Jordan ( $1,795 ) ( $1,045 ) <P> Kissel ( $1,595 ) Windsor ( Moon ) <P> Marmon ( $1,465 ) ( $1,045 ) <P> Over $2,000 <P> Cadillac ( $3,195 ) Packard ( $2,375 ) Cord ( $3,095 ) Pierce-Arrow Cunningham ( $7,500 ) ( $2,875 ) DuPont ( $3,000 delivered ) Ruxton ( $4,500 delivered ) Franklin ( $2,160 ) Stearns-Knight La Salle ( $2,335 ) ( $5,000 ) Lincoln ( $4,200 ) Stutz ( $2,995 ) <P> Cadillac . Bidding strongly for logo 's luxury trade was a new model by Cadillac . Autophiles who once gloated over Packard 's mighty " Twin Six " gathered around the enclosure which contained the new Cadillac engine , regally mounted . Composed of two blocks of eight cylinders ( each with carburetor ) set at an angle of 45 instead of the usual 90 for a V-type , the engine will develop from 165 to 185 h. p. , send the V16 gliding along with electric smoothness . Ready in April , the V16 will sell from $5,500 up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
