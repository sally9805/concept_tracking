" They apparently had us on the run a short time ago , but I am glad to see that now , all over the country , Republicans are plucking up courage and are back on the firing line . " Such were the words , prescient of Democratic defeat , spoken at the East Side High School at Paterson , N. J. , by Republican Walter Evans Edge who , as a U. S. Senator ( 1919-29 ) used to flap his elbows up &; down like a buzzard in flight every time he made a speech . Date of the utterance : a fortnight before that November day in 1932 when Franklin Roosevelt carried 42 of the 48 states of the Union . <P> Since that time much water has gone under the bridge and Mr. Edge has gone over the dam into history as Herbert Hoover 's Ambassador to France . Last April he and his pretty young wife returned from a world cruise in time for the asparagus season . Last week , the season of his favorite vegetable having closed , he sailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deck of the Normandie , he swelled his chest , flapped his elbows and spoke once more of the firing line : " I want a month 's rest so that I can come back to help straighten out the madhouse in Washington . When I return I will stay in Washington for the winter and get on the firing line . The situation looks more &; more encouraging for the Republican Party . " Walter Evans Edge is one of the worst prophets in the Republican Party . Nevertheless , his words last week had a ring of truth about them . Year ago , to the question " Can Roosevelt be beaten in 1936 ? " , the only sensible answer seemed to be an emphatic " No ! " By last week many of those who year ago had answered with such conviction were tentatively replying with another question : " Do you think he can ? " Professionals . The simple fact that people were asking " Can Roosevelt be beaten ? " stirred Republicans with hope . <P> If the public is of the opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lexicon of politics , it becomes a possibility that he can be beaten . Last fortnight the silver-haired ex-diplomat , Henry Prather Fletcher , who has been far from a diplomatic success as Republican National Chairman , marched to the microphone , as he has not done in months , and cried over the air : " It has been wisecracked that you can not eat the Constitution . You ca n't , nor can you eat the Bible , or the Golden Rule , or the Ten Commandments , or the deed to your property , or your life insurance policy . . . . " <P> Robert H. Lucas , oldtime G. O. P. wheelhorse whom Herbert Hoover had for executive director at Republican National Headquarters , brushed aside the cobwebs of obscurity and dashed off an 800-word letter to 3,000 Republican county chairmen , 450 city leaders and 800 " Young Republicans , " polling them on their preferences for Republican nominee in 1936 , exhorting them : " All this scared-rabbit talk about ' You ca n't beat a man with four billion dollars ' is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swallowing for five years A lot of hooey ! Let 's get behind a leader with some guts for the fight and in 90 days you 'll see a reborn Republican Party in this country . . . and with the battle cry ' Save the Constitution ' sweeping all before it . Just remember Valley Forge ! "
