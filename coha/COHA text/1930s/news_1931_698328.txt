Trading arrangements whereby Canada and Australia would get a larger share of the British grain trade at the expense of the United States and Argentina are left for future negotiations incidental to the Imperial Conference at Ottawa next Summer .

This will mean profitable grain farming here . The announcement of the government policy was received with cheers by the House , and there was more jovial enthusiasm in the lobby immediately afterward than at any time since the National Government came into power . It was hailed by tariff Conservatives as the first real evidence that Great Britain had embarked on a long-term policy of protecting her own industries .

" The scheme was designed to secure the producers a market with the maximum price for wheat of milling quality . No contribution ' from the exchequer in the way of a subsidy will be involved . It is not intended to encourage the cultivation of land unsuitable for wheat .

The domestic quota is held to have the sole purpose of guaranteeing a market for British domestic wheat , which , it has been estimated here , supplies about 20 per cent of British requirements . Definite figures on British needs were not available here late tonight , but one authority said that , in view of the fact that virtually all British wheat is now being used in the British Isles and none is being exported , the new decree could be interpreted only as a preliminary to the establishment of dominion preference .
