Long before the Civil War there was horse racing in New Jersey . In the 1880s Jersey 's Monmouth Park , with its imported British bookmaking system as well as new-fangled pari-mutuel betting machines , was the rendezvous for New York 's fashionable " 400 . " But the citizens of New Jersey in 1897 decided that gambling was a menace , outlawed it , killed racing . <P> Last week a new generation of Jersey voters , following in the footsteps of 21 other U. S. States which have recently grasped at gambling as a source of revenue , decided to revive horse racing , voted to legalize pari-mutuel betting in their State . Taxes on the pari-mutuel take at four proposed tracks ( probable sites : Camden , Atlantic City , Asbury Park and a spot near the Jersey end of the George Washington Bridge , just across the river from New York City ) will add $5,000,000 a year for State Relief , avert a threatened State income tax ( which Jerseyites have so far escaped ) and put 6,000 men to work . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> While New York race-track owners were moaning over the idea of local competition and turf men from coast to coast were frowning on the current overexpansion of the horse-racing business ( there will be over 60 supposedly Grade A tracks in the U. S. next year ) , California went a step further in using horse racing to balance a budget . To Governor Olson , the State Legislature last week sent a bill legalizing ( and supervising ) poolroom bookmaking and other away-from-the-track horse-race betting . Taxation on California 's handbook betting ( which is not limited to California tracks ) will net the State $20,000,000 a year , its proponents say , in addition to the $2,500,000 the State now receives from pari-mutuel wagering at its five tracks .
