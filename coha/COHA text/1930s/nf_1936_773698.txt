txt 4. o THE GENERAL THEORY OF EMPLOYMENT BK.1I possess significance and validity within certain limits . But the proper place for such things as net real output and the general level of prices lies within the field of historical and statistical description , and their purpose should be to satisfy historical or social curiosity , a purpose for which perfect precision ? such as our causal analysis requires , whether or not our knowledge of the actual values of the relevant quantities is complete or exact ? is neither usual nor necessary . To say that net output to-day is greater , but the price-level lower , than ten years ago or one year ago , is a proposition of a similar character to the statement that Queen Victoria was a better queen but not a happier woman than Queen Elizabeth ? a proposition not without meaning and not without interest , but unsuitable as material for the differential calculus . Our precision will be a mock precision if we try to use such partly vague and non-quantitative concepts as the basis of a quantitative analysis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an entrepreneur is concerned with decisions as to the scale on which to work a given capital equipment ; and when we say that the expectation of an increased demand , i.e. a raising of the aggregate demand function , will lead to an increase in aggregate output , we really mean that the firms , which own the capital equipment , will be induced to associate with it a greater aggregate employment of labour . In the case of an individual firm or industry producing a homogeneous product we can speak legitimately , if we wish , of increases or decreases of output . But when we are aggregating the activities of all firms , we can not speak accurately except in terms of quantities of employment applied to a given equipment . The concepts of output as a whole and its price-level are not required in this context , since we have no need of an absolute // measure of current aggregate output , such as would enable us to compare its amount with the amount which would result from the association of a different capital equipment with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of description or rough comparison , we wish to speak of an increase of output , we must rely on the general presumption that the amount of employment associated with a given capital equipment will be a satisfactory index of the amount of resultant output ; ? the two being presumed to increase and decrease together , though not in a definite numerical proportion . In dealing with the theory of employment I propose , therefore , to make use of only two fundamental units of quantity , namely , quantities of money-value and quantities of employment . The first of these is strictly homogeneous , and the second can be made so . For , in so far as different grades and kinds of labour and salaried assistance enjoy a more or less fixed relative remuneration , the quantity of employment can be sufficiently defined for our purpose by taking an hour 's employment of ordinary labour as our unit and weighting an hour 's employment of special labour in proportion to its remuneration ; i.e. an hour of special labour remunerated at double ordinary rates will count as two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantity of employment is measured the labour-unit ; and the money-wage of a labour-unit we shall call the wage-unit . ' Thus , if E is the wages ( and salaries ) bill , W the wage-unit , and N the quantity of employment , E=N . W. This assumption of homogeneity in the supply of labour is not upset by the obvious fact of great differences in the specialised skill of individual workers and in their suitability for different occupations . For , 1 If X stands for any quantity measured in terms of money , it will often be convenient to write X. for the same quantity measured in terms of the wage-unit. // if the remuneration of the workers is proportional to their efficiency , the differences are dealt with by our having regarded individuals as contributing to the supply of labour in proportion to their remuneration ; whilst if , as output increases , a given firm has to bring in labour which is less and less efficient for its special purposes per wage-unit paid to it , this is merely one factor among others leading to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ output as more labour is employed on it . We subsume , so to speak , the non-homogeneity of equally remunerated labour units in the equipment , which we regard as less and less adapted to employ the available labour units as output increases , instead of regarding the available labour units as less and less adapted to use a homogeneous capital equipment . Thus if there is no surplus of specialised or practised labour and the use of less suitable labour involves a higher labour cost per unit of output , this means that the rate at- which the return from the equipment diminishes as employment increases is more rapid than it would be if there were such a surplus . ' Even in the limiting case where different labour units were so highly specialised as to be altogether incapable of being substituted for one another , there is no awkwardness ; for this merely means that the elasticity of supply of output from a particular type of capital equipment falls suddenly to zero when all the available labour specialised to its use is already employed.2 Thus our assumption of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of output rises with increasing demand even when there is still a surplus of equipment identical in type with the equipment in use . If we suppose that the surplus supply of labour forms a pool equally available to all entrepreneurs and that labour employed for a given purpose is rewarded , in part at least , per unit of effort and not with strict regard to its efficiency in its actual particular employment ( which is in most cases the realistic assumption to make ) , the diminishing efficiency of the labour employed is an outstanding example of rising supply price with increasing output , not due to internal diseconomies . How the supply curve in ordinary use is supposed to deal with the above difficulty I can not say , since those who use this curve have not made their assumptions very clear . Probably they are assuming that labour // geneous unit of labour involves no difficulties unless there is great instability in the relative remuneration of different labour-units ; and even this difficulty can be dealt with , if it arises , by supposing a rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape of the aggregate supply function . It is my belief that much unnecessary perplexity can be avoided if we limit ourselves strictly to the two units , money and labour , when we are dealing with the behaviour of the economic system as a whole ; reserving the use of units of particular outputs and equipments to the occasions when we are analysing the output of individual firms or industries in isolation ; and the use of vague concepts , such as the quantity of output as a whdle , the quantity of capital equipment as a whole and the general level of prices , to the occasions when we are attempting some historical comparison which is within certain ( perhaps fairly wide ) limits avowedly unprecise and approximate . employed for a given purpose is always rewarded with strict regard to its efficiency for that purpose . But this is unrealistic . Perhaps the essential reason for treating the varying efficiency of labour as though it belonged to the equipment lies in the fact that the increasing surpluses , which emerge as output is increased , accrue in practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more efficient workers ( though these may get an advantage through being employed more regularly and by receiving earlier promotion ) ; that is to say , men of differing efficiency working at the same job are seldom paid at rates closely proportional to their efficiencies . Where , however , increased pay for higher efficiency occurs , and in so far as it occurs , my method takes account of it ; since in calculating the number of labour units employed , the individual workers are weighted in proportion to their remuneration . On my assumptions interesting complications obviously arise where we are dealing with particular supply curves since their shape will depend on the demand for suitable labour in other directions . To ignore these complications would , as I have said , be unrealistic . But we need not consider them when we are dealing with employment as a whole , provided we assume that a given volume of effective demand has a particular distribution of this demand between different products uniquely associated with it . It may be , however , that this would not hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand . E.g. an increase in effective demand due to an increased propensity to consume might find itself faced by a different aggregate supply function from that which would face an equal increase in demand due to an increased inducement to invest . All this , however , belongs to the detailed analysis of the general ideas here set forth , which it is no part of my immediate purpose to pursue . 44 THE GENERAL THEORY OF EMPLOYMENT Bx. ii It follows that we shall measure changes in current output by reference to the number of men employed ( whether to satisfy consumers or to produce fresh capital equipment ) on the existing capital equipment , skilled workers being weighted in proportion to their remuneration . We have no need of a quantitative comparison between this output and the output which would result from associating a different set of workers with a different capital equipment . To predict how entrepreneurs possessing a given equipment will re-spond to a shift in the aggregate demand function it is not necessary to know how the quantity of the result-ing output , the standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with what they were at a different date or in another country . Iv It is easily shown that the conditions of supply , such as are usually expressed in terms of the supply curve , and the elasticity of supply relating output to price , can be handled in terms of our two chosen units by means of the aggregate supply function , without refer-ence to quantities of output , whether we are concerned with a particular firm or industry or with economic activity as a whole . For the aggregate supply function for a given firm ( and similarly for a given industry or for industry as a whole ) is given by where Z , is the return the expectation of which will induce a level of employment N , . If , therefore , the relation between employment and output is such that an employment N , results in an output 0 , , where 0 , = , 4r , ( N , ) , it follows that is the ordinary supply curve . // Thus in the case of each homogeneous commodity , for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning , we can evaluate Z , =cp , ( N , ) in the ordinary way ; but we can then aggregate the N , ' s in a way which we can not aggregate the O , ' s , since 1 ; 0 , is not a numerical quantity . Moreover , if we can assume that , in a given environment , a given aggregate employment will be distributed in a unique way between different industries , so that N , is a function of N , further simplifications are possible . // EXPECTATION AS DETERMINING OUTPUT AND EMPLOYMENT I ALL production is for the purpose of ultimately satisfying a consumer . Time usually elapses , however ? and sometimes much time ? between the incurring of costs by the producer ( with the consumer in view ) and the purchase of the output by the ultimate consumer . Meanwhile the entrepreneur ( including both the producer and the investor in this description ) has to form the best expectations ' he can as to what the consumers will be prepared to pay when he is ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elapse of what may be a lengthy period ; and he has no choice but to be guided by these expectations , if he is to produce at all by processes which occupy time . These expectations , upon which business decisions depend , fall into two groups , certain individuals or firms being specialised in the business of framing the first type of expectation and others in the business of framing the second . The first type is concerned with the price which a manufacturer can expect to get for his " finished " output at the time when he commits himself to starting the process which will produce it ; output being " finished " ( from the point of view of the manufacturer ) when it is ready to be used or to be sold to a second party . The ' For the method of arriving at an equivalent of these expectations in terms of sale-proceeds see footnote ( 3 ) to p. 24 above . 46 // second type is concerned with what the entrepreneur can hope to earn in. the shape of future returns if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished " output as an addition to his capital equipment . We may call the former short-term expectation and the latter longterm expectation . Thus the behaviour of each individual firm in deciding its daily output will be determined by its short-term expectations ? expectations as to the cost of output on various possible scales and expectations as to the sale-proceeds of this output ; though , in the case of additions to capital equipment and even of sales to distributors , these short-term expectations will largely depend on the long-term ( or medium-term ) expectations of other parties . It is upon these various expectations that the amount of employment which the firms offer will depend . The actually realised results of the production and sale of output will only be relevant to employment in so far as they cause a modification of subsequent expectations .. Nor , on the other hand , are the original expectations relevant , which led the firm to acquire the capital equipment and the stock of intermediate products and half-finished materials with which it finds itself at the time when it has to decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every occasion of such a decision , the decision will be made , with reference indeed to this equipment and stock , but in the light of the current expectations of prospective costs and sale-proceeds . Now , in general , a change in expectations ( whether short-term or long-term ) will only produce its full effect on employment over a considerable period . The change in employment due to a change in expectations will not be the same on the second day after the change as on the first , or the same on the Daily here stands for the shortest interval after which the firm is free to revise its decision as to how much employment to offer . It is , so to speak , the minimum effective unit of economic time . // third day as on the second , and so on , even though there be no further change in expectations . In the case of short-term expectations this is because changes in expectation are not , as a rule , sufficiently violent or rapid , when they are for the worse , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , in the light of the revised expectation , it was a mistake to have begun ; whilst , when they are for the better , some time for preparation must needs elapse before employment can reach the level at which it would have stood if the state of expectation had been revised sooner . In the case of long-term expectations , equipment which will not be replaced will continue to give employment until it is worn out ; whilst when the change in long-term expectations is for the better , employment may be at a higher level at first , than it will be after there has been time to adjust the equipment to the new situation . If we suppose a state of expectation to continue for a sufficient length of time for the effect on employment to have worked itself out so completely that there is , broadly speaking , no piece of employment going on which would not have taken place if the new state of expectation had always existed , the steady level of employment thus attained may be called the long period employment I corresponding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although expectation may change so frequently that the actual level of employment has never had time to reach the long-period employment corresponding to the existing state of expectation , nevertheless every state of expectation has its definite corresponding level of long-period employment . Let us consider , first of all , the process of transition It is not necessary that the level of long-period employment should be constant , i.e. long-period conditions are not necessarily static . For example , a steady increase in wealth or population may constitute a part of the unchanging expectation . The only condition is that the existing expectations should have been foreseen sufficiently far ahead . // to a long-period position due to a change in expectation , which is not confused or interrupted by any further change in expectation . We will first suppose that the change is of such a character that the new long-period employment will be greater than the old . Now , as a rule , it will only be the rate of input which will be much affected at the beginning , that is to say , the volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production , whilst the output of consumption-goods and the amount of employment on the later stages of processes which were started before the change will remain much the same as before . In so far as there were stocks of partly finished goods , this conclusion may be modified ; though it is likely to remain true that the initial increase in employment will be modest . As , however , the days pass by , employment will gradually increase . Moreover , it is easy to conceive of conditions which will cause it to increase at some stage to a higher level than the new long-period employment . For the process of building up capital to satisfy the new state of expectation may lead to more employment and also to more current consumption than will occur when the long-period position has been reached . Thus the change in expectation may lead to a gradual crescendo in the level of employment , rising to a peak and then declining to the new long-period level . The same thing may occur even if the new long-period level is the same as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction of consumption which renders certain existing processes and their equipment obsolete . Or again , if the new long-period employment is less than the old , the level of employment during the transition may fall for a time below what the new long-period level is going to be . Thus a mere change in expectation is capable of producing an oscillation of the same kind of shape as a cyclical movement , in the course of working itself out . It was movements of this kind which I discussed in my Treatise on Money in connection 5o THE GENERAL THEORY OF EMPLOYMENT BK.II with the building up or the depletion of stocks of working and liquid capital consequent on change . An uninterrupted process of transition , such as the above , to a new long-period position can be complicated in detail . But the actual course of events is more complicated still . For the state of expectation is liable to constant change , a new expectation being superimposed long before the previous change has fully worked itself out ; so that the economic machine is occupied at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence of which is due to various past states of expectation . II This leads us to the relevance of this discussion for our present purpose . It is evident from the above that the level of employment at any time depends , in a sense , not merely on the existing state of expectation but on the states of expectation which have existed over a certain past period . Nevertheless past expectations , which have not yet worked themselves out , are embodied in the to-day 's capital equipment with reference to which the entrepreneur has to make to-day 's decisions , and only influence his decisions in so far as they are so embodied . It follows , therefore , that , in spite of the above , to-day 's employment can be correctly described as being governed by to-day 's expectations taken in conjunction with to-day 's capital equipment . Express reference to current long-term expectations can seldom be avoided . But it will often be safe to omit express reference to short-term expectation , in view of the fact that in practice the process of revision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on largely in the light of realised results ; so that expected and realised results run into and overlap one another in their influence . For , although output and employment are determined by // the producer 's short-term expectations and not by past results , the most recent results usually play a predominant part in determining what these expectations are . It would be too complicated to work out the expectations de novo whenever a productive process was being started ; and it would , moreover , be a waste of time since a large part of the circumstances usually continue substantially unchanged from one day to the next . Accordingly it is sensible for producers to base their expectations on the assumption that the most recently realised results will continue , except in so far as there are definite reasons for expecting a change . Thus in practice there is a large overlap between the effects on employment of the realised sale-proceeds of recent output and those of the sale-proceeds expected from current input ; and producers ' forecasts are more often gradually modified in the light of results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must not forget that , in the case of durable goods , the producer 's short-term expectations are based on the current long-term expectations of the investor ; and it is of the nature of long-term expectations that they can not be checked at short intervals in the light of realized results . Moreover , as we shall see in Chapter 12 , where we shall consider long-term expectations in more detail , they are liable to sudden revision . Thus the factor of current long-term expectations can not be even approximately eliminated or replaced by realised results . This emphasis on the expectation entertained when the decision to produce is taken , meets , I think , Mr. Hawtrey 's point that input and employment are influenced by the accumulation of stocks before prices have fallen or disappointment in respect of output is reflected in a realised loss relatively to expectation . For the accumulation of unsold stocks ( or decline of forward orders ) is precisely the kind of event which is most likely to cause input to differ from what the mere statistics of the sale-proceeds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without criticism into the next period . // THE DEFINITION OF INCOME , SAVING AND INVESTMENT 1 . Income DURING any period of time an entrepreneur will have sold finished output to consumers or to other entrepreneurs for a certain sum which we will designate as A. He will also have spent a certain sum , designated by Al , on purchasing finished output from other entrepreneurs . And he will end up with a capital equipment , which term includes both his stocks of unfinished goods or working capital and his stocks of finished goods , having a value G. Some part , however , of A + G - Al will be attributable , not to the activities of the period in question , but to the capital equipment which he had at the beginning of the period . We must , therefore , in order to arrive at what we mean by the income of the current period , deduct from A + G - Al a certain sum , to represent that part of its value which has been ( in some sense ) contributed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defining income is solved as soon as we have found a satisfactory method for calculating this deduction . There are two possible principles for calculating it , each of which has a certain significance ; ? one of them in connection with production , and the other in connection with consumption . Let us consider them in turn . ( i ) The actual value G of the capital equipment at 52 // the end of the period is the net result of the entrepreneur , on the one hand , having maintained and improved it during the period , both by purchases from other entrepreneurs and by work done upon it by himself , and , on the other hand , having exhausted or depreciated it through using it to produce output . If he had decided not to use it to produce output , there is , nevertheless , a certain optimum sum which it would have paid him to spend on maintaining and improving it . Let us suppose that , in this event , he would have spent B ' on its maintenance and improvement , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been worth G ' at the end of the period . That is to say , G ' ? B ' is the maximum net value which might have been conserved from the previous period , if it had not been used to produce A. The excess of this potential value of the equipment over G Al is the measure of what has been sacrificed ( one way or another ) to produce A. Let us call this quantity , namely ( G ' ? B ' ) ? ( G ? Al ) , which measures the sacrifice of value involved in the production of A , the user cost of A. User cost will be written U. ' The amount paid out by the entrepreneur to the other factors of production in return for their services , which from their point of view is their income , we will call the factor cost of A. The sum of the factor cost F and the user cost U we shall call the prime cost of the output A. We can then define the income2 of the entrepreneur as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold during the period over his prime cost . The entrepreneur 's income , that is to say , is taken as being equal to the quantity , depending on his scale of production , which he endeavours to maximise , i.e. to his gross profit 1 Some further observations on user cost are given in an appendix to this chapter . As distinguished from his net income which we shall define below . // in the ordinary sense of this term ; ? which agrees with common sense . Hence , since the income of the rest of the community is equal to the entrepreneur 's factor cost , aggregate income is equal to A - U. Income , thus defined , is a completely unambiguous quantity . Moreover , since it is the entrepreneur 's expectation of the excess of this quantity over his outgoings to the other factors of production which he endeavours to maximise when he decides how much employment to give to the other factors of production , it is the quantity which is causally significant for employment . It is conceivable , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , so that user cost will be negative . For example , this may well be the case if we happen to choose our period in such a way that input has been increasing during the period but without there having been time for the increased output to reach the stage of being finished and sold . It will also be the case , whenever there is positive investment , if we imagine industry to be so much integrated that entrepreneurs make most of their equipment for themselves . Since , however , user cost is only negative when the entrepreneur has been increasing his capital equipment by his own labour , we can , in an economy where capital equipment is largely manufactured by different firms from those which use it , normally think of user cost as being positive . Moreover , it is difficult to conceive of a case where marginal user cost associated with an increase in A , i.e. dA , will be other than positive . It may be convenient to mention here , in anticipation of the latter part of this chapter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggregate consumption ( C ) of the period is equal to : s. : ( A - Al ) , and the aggregate investment ( I ) is equal to 1 : ( A1 - U ) . Moreover , U is the individual entrepreneur 's disinvestment ( and - U his investment ) in respect of his own equipment exclusive // of what he buys from other entrepreneurs . Thus in a completely integrated system ( where Al = o ) consumption is equal to A and investment to ? U , i.e. to G ? ( G ' ? B ' ) . The slight complication of the above , through the introduction of A1 , is simply due to the desirability of providing in a generalised way for the case of a non-integrated system of production . Furthermore , the effective demand is simply the aggregate income ( or proceeds ) which the entrepreneurs expect to receive , inclusive of the incomes which they will hand on to the other factors of production , from the amount of current employment which they decide to give . The aggregate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeds which their outputs are expected to yield ; and the effective demand is the point on the aggregate demand function which becomes effective because , taken in conjunction with the conditions of supply , it corresponds to the level of employment which maximises the entrepreneur 's expectation of profit . This set of definitions also has the advantage that we can equate the marginal proceeds ( or income ) to the marginal factor cost ; and thus arrive at the same sort of propositions relating marginal proceeds thus defined to marginal factor costs as have been stated by those economists who , by ignoring user cost or assuming it to be zero , have equated supply price 1 to marginal factor cost.2 Supply price is , I think , an incompletely defined term , if the problem of defining user cost has been ignored . The matter is further discussed in the appendix to this chapter , where I argue that the exclusion of user cost from supply price , whilst sometimes appropriate in the case of aggregate supply price , is inappropriate to the problems of the supply price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 For example , let us take Z , o =0(N) , or alternatively Z =W . ? ( N ) as the aggregate supply function ( where W is the wage-unit and W . Z ? =Z ) . Then , since the proceeds of the marginal product is equal to the marginal factor-cost at every point on the aggregate supply curve , we have ON= &A,,,?AU,,=AZ,,=y(N),; that is to say . ' ( N ) =r ; provided that factor cost bears a constant ratio to wage cost , and that the aggregate supply function for each firm ( the number 56 THE GENERAL THEORY OF EMPLOYMENT Bx. n ( ii ) We turn , next , to the second of the principles referred to above . We have dealt so far with that part of the change in the value of the capital equipment at the end of the period as compared with its value at the beginning which is due to the voluntary decisions of the entrepreneur in seeking to maximise his profit . But there may , in addition , be an involuntary loss ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurring for reasons beyond his control and irrespective of his current decisions , on account of ( e.g. ) a change in market values , wastage by obsolescence or the mere passage of time , or destruction by catastrophe such as war or earthquake . Now some part of these involuntary losses , whilst they are unavoidable , are ? broadly speaking ? not unexpected ; such as losses through the lapse of time irrespective of use , and also " normal " obsolescence which , as Professor Pigou expresses it , " is sufficiently regular to be foreseen , if not in detail , at least in the large " , including , we may add , those losses to the community as a whole which are sufficiently regular to be commonly regarded as " insurable risks " . Let us ignore for the moment the fact that the amount of the expected loss depends on when the expectation is assumed to be framed , and let us call the depreciation of the equipment , which is involuntary but not unexpected , i.e. the excess of the expected depreciation over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be written V. It is , perhaps , hardly necessary to point out that this definition is not the same as Marshall 's definition of supplementary cost , though the underlying idea , namely , of dealing with that part of the expected depreciation which does not enter into prime cost , is similar . of which is assumed to be constant ) is independent of the number of men employed in other industries , so that the terms of the above equation , which hold good for each individual entrepreneur , can be summed for the entrepreneurs as a whole . This means that , if wages are constant and other factor costs are a constant proportion of the wages-bill , the aggregate supply function is linear with a slope given by the reciprocal of the money-wage. // In reckoning , therefore , the net income and the net profit of the entrepreneur it is usual to deduct the estimated amount of the supplementary cost from his income and gross profit as defined above . For the psychological effect on the entrepreneur , when he is considering what he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost is virtually the same as though it came off his gross profit . In his capacity as a producer deciding whether or not to use the equipment , prime cost and gross profit , as defined above , are the significant concepts . But in his capacity as a consumer the amount of the supplementary cost works on his mind in the same way as if it were a part of the prime cost . Hence we shall not only come nearest to common usage but will also arrive at a concept which is relevant to the amount of consumption , if , in defining aggregate net income , we deduct the supplementary cost as well as the user cost , so that aggregate net income is equal toA - U - V. There remains the change in the value of the equipment , due to unforeseen changes in market values , exceptional obsolescence or destruction by catastrophe , which is both involuntary and ? in a broad sense ? unforeseen . The actual loss under this head , which we disregard even in reckoning net income and charge to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The causal significance of net income lies in the psychological influence of the magnitude of V on the amount of current consumption , since net income is what we suppose the ordinary man to reckon his available income to be when he is deciding how much to spend on current consumption . This is not , of course , - the only factor of which he takes account when he is deciding how much to spend . It makes a considerable difference , for example , how much windfall gain or loss he is making on capital account . But there is a difference between the supplementary cost and a windfall loss in that changes in the former are apt to affect 58 THE GENERAL THEORY OF EMPLOYMENT BK.11 him in just the same way as changes in his gross profit . It is the excess of the proceeds of the current output over the sum of the prime cost and the supplementary cost which is relevant to the entrepreneur 's consumption ; whereas , although the windfall loss ( or gain ) enters into his decisions , it does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windfall loss does not have the same effect as an equal supplementary cost . We must now recur , however , to the point that the line between supplementary costs and windfall losses , i.e. between those unavoidable losses which we think it proper to debit to income account and those which it is reasonable to reckon as a windfall loss ( or gain ) on capital account , is partly a conventional or psychological one , depending on what are the commonly accepted criteria for estimating the former . For no unique principle can be established for the estimation of supplementary cost , and its amount will depend on our choice of an accounting method . The expected value of the supplementary cost , when the equipment was originally produced , is a definite quantity . But if it is re-estimated subsequently , its amount over the remainder of the life of the equipment may have changed as a result of a change in the meantime in our expectations ; the windfall capital loss being the discounted value of the difference between the former and the revised expectation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved principle of business accounting , endorsed by the Inland Revenue authorities , to establish a figure for the sum of the supplementary cost and the user cost when the equipment is acquired and to maintain this unaltered during the life of the equipment , irrespective of subsequent changes in expectation . In this case the supplementary cost over any period must be taken as the excess of this predetermined figure over the actual user cost . This has the advantage of ensuring that the windfall gain or loss shall be zero over the life of the // equipment taken as a whole . But it is also reasonable in certain circumstances to recalculate the allowance for supplementary cost on the basis of current values and expectations at an arbitrary accounting interval , e.g. annually . Business men in fact differ as to which course they adopt . It may be convenient to call the initial expectation of supplementary cost when the equipment is first acquired the basic supplementary cost , and the same quantity recalculated up to date on the basis of current values and expectations the current supplementary cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definition of supplementary cost than that it comprises those deductions from his income which a typical entrepreneur makes before reckoning what he considers his net income for the purpose of declaring a dividend ( in the case of a corporation ) or of deciding the scale of his current consumption ( in the case of an individual ) . Since windfall charges on capital account are not going to be ruled out of the picture , it is clearly better , in case of doubt , to assign an item to capital account , and to include in supplementary cost only what rather obviously belongs there . For any overloading of the former can be corrected by allowing it more influence on the rate of current consumption than it would otherwise have had . It will be seen that our definition of net income comes very close to Marshall 's definition of income , when he decided to take refuge in the practices of the Income Tax Commissioners and ? broadly speaking ? to regard as income whatever they , with their experience , choose to treat as such . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of the most careful and extensive investigation which is available , to interpret what , in practice , it is usual to treat as net income . It also corresponds to the money value of Professor Pigou 's most recent definition of the National Dividend . ' ' Economic Journal , June 1935 , P ? 235. 6o THE GENERAL THEORY OF EMPLOYMENT BK.II It remains true , however , that net income , being based on an equivocal criterion which different authorities might interpret differently , is not perfectly clear-cut . Professor Hayek , for example , has suggested that an individual owner of capital goods might aim at keeping the income he derives from his possession constant , so that he would not feel himself free to spend his income on consumption until he had set aside sufficient to offset any tendency of his investment-income to decline for whatever reason . ' I doubt if such an individual exists ; but , obviously , no theoretical objection can be raised against this deduction as providing a possible psychological criterion of net income . But when Professor Hayek infers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corresponding vagueness , he is only right if he means net saving and net investment . The saving and the investment , which are relevant to the theory of employment , are clear of this defect , and are capable of objective definition , as we have shown above . Thus it is a mistake to put all the emphasis on net income , which is only relevant to decisions concerning consumption , and is , moreover , only separated from various other factors affecting consumption by a narrow line ; and to overlook ( as has been usual ) the concept of income proper , which is the concept relevant to decisions concerning current production and is quite unambiguous . The above definitions of income and of net income are intended to conform as closely as possible to common usage . It is necessary , therefore ; that I should at once remind the reader that in my Treatise on Money I defined income in a special sense . The peculiarity in my former definition related to that part of aggregate income which accrues to the entrepreneurs , since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually realised from their current operations nor the profit which they expected when they decided to under1 " The Maintenance of Capital " , Economica , August 1935 , p. 241 et seq . cH.6 THE DEFINITION OF INCOME 6i take their current operations , but in some sense ( not , as I now think , sufficiently defined if we allow for the possibility of changes in the scale of output ) a normal or equilibrium profit ; with the result that on this definition saving exceeded investment by the amount of the excess of normal profit over the actual profit . I am afraid that this use of terms has caused considerable confusion , especially in the case of the correlative use of saving ; since conclusions ( relating , in particular , to the excess of saving over investment ) , which were only valid if the terms employed were interpreted in my special sense , have been frequently adopted in popular discussion as though the terms were being employed in their more familiar sense . For this reason , and also because I no longer require my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to discard them ? with much regret for the confusion which they have caused . ii . Saving and Investment Amidst the welter of divergent usages of terms , it is agreeable to discover one fixed point . So far as I know , everyone is agreed that saving means the excess of income over expenditure on consumption . Thus any doubts about the meaning of saving must arise from doubts about the meaning either of income or of consumption . Income we have defined above . Expenditure on consumption during any period must mean the value of goods sold to consumers during that period , which throws us back to the question of what is meant by a consumer-purchaser . Any reasonable definition of the line between consumer-purchasers and investor purchasers will serve us equally well , provided that it is consistently applied . Such problem as there is , e.g. whether it is right to regard the purchase of a motor-car as a consumer-purchase and the purchase of a house as an investor-purchase , has been frequently discussed and I have nothing material to add to the discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw the line between the consumer and the entrepreneur . Thus when we have defined Al as the value of what one entrepreneur has purchased from another , we have implicitly settled the question . It follows that expenditure on consumption can be unambiguously defined as 1 , ( A - Al ) , where 1'A is the total sales made during the period and Al is the total sales made by one entrepreneur to another . In what follows it will be convenient ) as a rule , to omit and write A for the aggregate sales of all kinds , Al for the aggregate sales from one entrepreneur to another and U for the aggregate user costs of the entrepreneurs . Having now defined both income and consumption , the definition of saving , which is the excess of income over consumption , naturally follows . Since income is equal to A - U and consumption is equal to A - Al , it follows that saving is equal to Al - U. Similarly , we have net saving for the excess of net income over consumption , equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income also leads at once to the definition of current investment . For we must mean by this the current addition to the value of the capital equipment which has resulted from the productive activity of the period . This is , clearly , equal to what we have just defined as saving . For it is that part of the income of the period which has not passed into consumption . We have seen above that as the result of the production of any period entrepreneurs end up with having sold finished output having a value A and with a capital equipment which has suffered a deterioration measured by U ( or an improvement measured by - U where U is negative ) as a result of having produced and parted with A , after allowing for purchases A , from other entrepreneurs . During the same period finished output having a value A - A , will have passed into consumption . The excess of A - U over A - Al , namely A , - U , is the addition to capital // equipment as a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , the investment of the period . Similarly Al - U - V , which is the net addition to capital equipment , after allowing for normal impairment in the value of capital apart from its being used and apart from windfall changes in the value of the equipment chargeable to capital account , is the net investment of the period . Whilst , therefore , the amount of saving is an outcome of the collective behaviour of individual consumers and the amount of investment of the collective behaviour of individual entrepreneurs , these two amounts are necessarily equal , since each of them is equal to the excess of income over consumption . Moreover , this conclusion in no way depends on any subtleties or peculiarities in the definition of income given above . Provided it is agreed that income is equal to the value of current output , that current investment is equal to the value of that part of current output which is not consumed , and that saving is equal to the excess of income over consumption ? all of which is conformable both to common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of economists ? the equality of saving and investment necessarily follows . In short Income = value of output = consumption + investment . Saving = income - consumption . Therefore saving = investment . Thus any set of definitions which satisfy the above conditions leads to the same conclusion . It is only by denying the validity of one or other of them that the conclusion can be avoided . The equivalence between the quantity of saving and the quantity of investment emerges from the bilateral character of the transactions between the producer on the one hand and , on the other hand , the consumer or the purchaser of capital equipment . 64 THE GENERAL THEORY OF EMPLOYMENT BK.11 Income is created by the value in excess of user cost which the producer obtains for the output he has sold ; but the whole of this output must obviously have been sold either to a consumer or to another entrepreneur ; and each entrepreneur 's current investment is equal to the excess of the equipment which he has purchased from other entrepreneurs over his own user cost . Hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which we call saving , can not differ from the addition to capital equipment which we call investment . And similarly with net saving and net investment . Saving , in fact , is a mere residual . The decisions to consume and the decisions to invest between them determine incomes . Assuming that the decisions to invest become effective , they must in doing so either curtail consumption or expand income . Thus the act of investment in itself can not help causing the residual or margin , which we call saving , to increase by a corresponding amount . It might be , of course , that individuals were so tete montee in their decisions as to how much they themselves would save and invest respectively , that there would be no point of price equilibrium at which transactions could take place . In this case our terms would cease to be applicable , since output would no longer have a definite market value , prices would find no restingplace between zero and infinity . Experience shows , however , that this , in fact , is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which allow of an equilibrium being reached at which the readiness to buy is equal to the readiness to sell . That there should be such a thing as a market value for output is , at the same time , a necessary condition for money-income to possess a definite value and a sufficient condition for the aggregate amount which saving individuals decide to save to be equal to the aggregate amount which investing individuals decide to invest . Clearness of mind on this matter is best reached , // perhaps , by thinking in terms of decisions to consume ( or to refrain from consuming ) rather than of decisions to save . A decision to consume or not to consume truly lies within the power of the individual ; so does a decision to invest or not to invest . The amounts of aggregate income and of aggregate saving are the results of the free choices of individuals whether or not to consume and whether or not to invest ; but they are neither of them capable of assuming an independent value resulting from a separate set of decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In accordance with this principle , the conception of the propensity to consume will , in what follows , take the place of the propensity or disposition to save . APPENDIX ON USER COST r USER cost has , I think , an importance for the classical theory of value which has been overlooked . There is more to be said about it than would be relevant or appropriate in this place . But , as a digression , we will examine it somewhat further in this appendix . An entrepreneur 's user cost is by definition equal to Al + ( G ' ? B ' ) ? G , where Al is the amount of our entrepreneur 's purchases from other entrepreneurs , G the actual value of his capital equipment at the end of the period , and G ' the value it might have had at the end of the period if he had refrained from using it and had spent the optimum sum B ' on its maintenance and improvement . Now G ? ( G ' ? B ' ) , namely the increment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value which he has inherited from the previous period , represents the entrepreneur 's current investment in his equipment and can be written I. Thus U , the user cost of his sales-turnover A , is equal to Al ? I where Al is what he has bought from other entrepreneurs and I is what he has currently invested in his own equipment . A little reflection will show that all this is no more than common sense . Some part of his outgoings to other entrepreneurs is balanced by the value of his current investment in his own equipment , and the rest represents the sacrifice which the output he has sold must have cost him over and above the total sum which he has paid out to the factors of production . If the reader tries to express the substance of this otherwise , he will find that its advantage lies in its avoidance of insoluble ( and unnecessary ) accounting problems . There is , I think , no other way of analysing the current proceeds of production unambiguously . If industry is completely integrated or if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o , the 66 // user cost is simply the equivalent of the current disinvestment involved in using the equipment ; but we are still left with the advantage that we do not require at any stage of the analysis to allocate the factor cost between the goods which are sold and the equipment which is retained . Thus we can regard the employment given by a firm , whether integrated or individual , as depending on a single consolidated decision  --  a procedure which corresponds to the actual interlocking character of the production of what is currently sold with total production . The concept of user cost enables us , moreover , to give a clearer definition than that usually adopted of the short-period supply price of a unit of a firm 's saleable output . For the shortperiod supply price is the sum of the marginal factor cost and the marginal user cost . Now in the modern theory of value it has been a usual practice to equate the short-period supply price to the marginal factor cost alone . It is obvious , however , that this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply price is specially defined so as to be net of marginal user cost , just as I have defined ( p. 24 above ) " proceeds " and " aggregate supply price " as being net of aggregate user cost . But , whereas it may be occasionally convenient in dealing with output as a whole to deduct user cost , this procedure deprives our analysis of all reality if it is habitually ( and tacitly ) applied to the output of a single industry or firm , since it divorces the " supply price " of an article from any ordinary sense of its " price " ; and some confusion may have resulted from the practice of doing so . It seems to have been assumed that " supply price " has an obvious ? meaning as applied to a unit of the saleable output of an individual firm , and the matter has not been deemed to require discussion . Yet the treatment both of what is purchased from other firms and of the wastage of the firm 's own equipment as a consequence of producing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the definition of income . For , even if we assume that the marginal cost of purchases from other firms involved in selling an additional unit of output has to be deducted from the sale-proceeds per unit in order to give us what we mean by our firm 's supply price , we still have to allow for the marginal disinvestment in the firm 's own equipment involved in producing the marginal output . Even if all production is carried on by a completely integrated firm , it is still illegitimate to suppose that the marginal user cost is zero , i.e. that the marginal disinvestment in equipment due to the production of the marginal output can generally be neglected . 68 THE GENERAL THEORY OF EMPLOYMENT BK . It The concepts of user cost and of supplementary cost also enable us to establish a clearer relationship between long-period supply price and short-period supply price . Long-period cost must obviously include an amount to cover the basic supplementary cost as well as the expected prime cost appropriately averaged over the life of the equipment . That is to say , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sum of the prime cost and the supplementary cost ; and , furthermore , in order to yield a normal profit , the long-period supply price must exceed the long-period cost thus calculated by an amount determined by the current rate of interest on loans of comparable term and risk , reckoned as a percentage of the cost of the equipment . Or if we prefer to take a standard " pure " rate of interest , we must include in the long-period cost a third term which we might call the risk-cost to cover the unknown possibilities of the actual yield differing from the expected yield . Thus the long period supply price is equal to the sum of the prime cost , the supplementary cost , the risk cost and the interest cost , into which several components it can be analysed . The shortperiod supply price , on the other hand , is equal to the marginal prime cost . The entrepreneur must , therefore , expect , when he buys or constructs his equipment , to cover his supplementary cost , his risk cost and his interest cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prime cost over its average value ; so that in long-period equilibrium the excess of the marginal prime cost over the average prime cost is equal to the sum of the supplementary , risk and interest costs. , The level of output , at which marginal prime cost is exactly equal to the sum of the average prime and supplementary costs , has a special importance , because it is the point at which the entrepreneur 's trading account breaks even . It corresponds , 3 This way of putting it depends on the convenient assumption that the marginal prime cost curve is continuous throughout its length for changes in output . In fact , this assumption is often unrealistic , and there may be one or more points of discontinuity , especially when we reach an output corresponding to the technical full capacity of the equipment . In this case the marginal analysis partially breaks down ; and the price may exceed the marginal prime cost , where the latter is reckoned in respect of a small decrease of output . ( Similarly there may often be a discontinuity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below a certain point ) . This is important when we are considering the short-period supply price in long period equilibrium , since in that case any discontinuities , which may exist corresponding to a point of technical full capacity , must be supposed to be in operation . Thus the short-period supply price In long-period equilibrium may have to exceed the marginal prime cost ( reckoned in terms of a small decrease of output ) . // that is to say , to the point of zero net profit ; whilst with a smaller output than this he is trading at a net loss . The extent to which the supplementary cost has to be provided for apart from the prime cost varies very much from one type of equipment to another . Two extreme cases are the following : ( i ) Some part of the maintenance of the equipment must necessarily take place pari passu with the act of using it ( e.g. oiling the machine ) . The expense of this ( apart from outside purchases ) is included in the factor cost . If , for physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current depreciation has necessarily to be made good in this way , the amount of the user cost ( apart from outside purchases ) would be equal and opposite to that of the supplementary cost ; and in long-period equilibrium the marginal factor cost would exceed the average factor cost by an amount equal to the risk and interest cost . ( ii ) Some part of the deterioration in the value of the equipment only occurs if it is used . The cost of this is charged in user cost , in so far as it is not made good pari passu with the act of using it . If loss in the value of the equipment could only occur in this way , supplementary cost would be zero . It may be worth pointing out that an entrepreneur does not use his oldest and worst equipment first , merely because its user cost is low ; since its low user cost may be outweighed by its relative inefficiency , i.e. by its high factor cost . Thus an entrepreneur uses by preference that part of his equipment for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of output.l It follows that for any given volume of output of the product in question there is a corresponding user cost , 2 but that this total user cost does not bear a uniform relation to the marginal . user cost , i.e. to the increment of user cost due to an increment in the rate of output . II User cost constitutes one of the links between the present and the future . For in deciding his scale of production an 1 Since user cost partly depends on expectations as to the future level of wages , a reduction in the wage-unit which is expected to be short-lived will cause factor cost and user cost to move in different proportions and so affect what equipment is used , and , conceivably , the level of effective demand , since factor cost may enter into the determination of effective demand in a different way from user cost . 2 The user cost of the equipment which is first brought into use is not necessarily independent of the total volume of output ( see below ) ; i.e. the 7o THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise a choice between using up his equipment now and preserving it to be used later on . It is the expected sacrifice of future benefit involved in present use which determines the amount of the user cost , and it is the marginal amount of this sacrifice which , together with the marginal factor cost and the expectation of the marginal proceeds , determines his scale of production . How , then , is the user cost of an act of production calculated by the entrepreneur ? We have defined the user cost as the reduction in the value of the equipment due to using it as compared with not using it , after allowing for the cost of the maintenance and improvements which it would be worth while to undertake and for purchases from other entrepreneurs . It must be arrived at , therefore , by calculating the discounted value of the additional prospective yield which would be obtained at some later dace if it were not used now . Now this must be at least equal to the present value of the opportunity to postpone replacement which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more . ' If there is no surplus or redundant stock , so that more units of similar equipment are being newly produced every year either as an addition or in replacement , it is evident that marginal user cost will be calculable by reference to the amount by which the life or efficiency of the equipment will be shortened if it is used , and the current replacement cost . If , however , there is redundant equipment , then the user cost will also depend on the rate of interest and the current ( i.e. re-estimated ) supplementary cost over the period of time before the redundancy is expected to be absorbed through wastage , etc . In this way interest cost and current supplementary cost enter indirectly into the calculation of user cost . The calculation is exhibited in its simplest and most intelligible form when the factor cost is zero , e.g. in the case of a redundant stock of a raw material such as copper , on the lines which I have worked out in my Treatise on Money , vol. ii . chap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at various future dates , a series which will be governed by the rate at which redundancy is being absorbed and gradually approaches the user cost may be affected all along the line when the total volume of output is changed . ' It will be more when it is expected that a more than normal yield can be obtained at some later date , which , however , is not expected to last long enough to justify ( or give time for ) the production of new equipment . To-day 's user cost is equal to the maximum of the discounted values of the potential expected yields of all the to-morrows. // estimated normal cost . The present value or user cost of a ton of surplus copper will then be equal to the greatest of the values obtainable by subtracting from the estimated future value at any given date of a ton of copper the interest cost and the current supplementary cost on a ton of copper between that date and the present . In the same way the user cost of a ship or factory or machine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated replacement cost discounted at the percentage rate of its interest and current supplementary costs to the prospective date of absorption of the redundancy . We have assumed above that the equipment will be replaced in due course by an identical article . If the equipment in question will not be renewed identically when it is worn out , then its user cost has to be calculated by taking a proportion of the user cost of the new equipment , which will be erected to do its work when it is discarded , given by its comparative efficiency . III The reader should notice that , where the equipment is not obsolescent but merely redundant for the time being , the difference between the actual user cost and its normal value ( i.e. the value when there is no redundant equipment ) varies with the interval of time which is expected to elapse before the redundancy is absorbed . Thus if the type of equipment in question is of all ages and not " bunched " , so that a fair proportion is reaching the end of its life annually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redundancy is exceptionally excessive . In the case of a general slump , marginal user cost will depend on how long entrepreneurs expect the slump to last . Thus the rise in the supply price when affairs begin to mend may be partly due to a sharp increase in marginal user cost due to a revision of their expectations . It has sometimes been argued , contrary to the opinion of business men , that organised schemes for scrapping redundant plant can not have the desired effect of raising prices unless they apply to the whole of the redundant plant . But the concept of user cost shows how the scrapping of ( say ) half the redundant plant may have the effect of raising prices immediately . For by bringing the date of the absorption of the redundancy nearer , this policy raises marginal user cost and consequently increases the current supply price . Thus business men would seem to 7z THE GENERAL THEORY OF EMPLOYMENT sx it have the notion of user cost implicitly in mind , though they do not formulate it distinctly . If the supplementary cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be low when there is surplus equipment . Moreover , when there is surplus equipment , the marginal factor and user costs are unlikely to be much in excess of their average value . If both these conditions are fulfilled , the existence of surplus equipment is likely to lead to the entrepreneur 's working at a net loss , and perhaps at a heavy net loss . There will not be a sudden transition from this state of affairs to a normal profit , taking place at the moment when the redundancy is absorbed . As the redundancy becomes less , the user cost will gradually increase ; and the excess of marginal over average factor and user cost may also gradually increase . IV In Marshall 's Principles of Economics ( 6th ed . P- 36o ) a part of user cost is included in prime cost under the heading of " extra wear-and-tear of plant " . But no guidance is given as to how this item is to be calculated or as to its importance . In his Theory of Unemployment ( p. 42 ) Professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the marginal output can , in general , be neglected : " The differences in the quantity of wear-and-tear suffered by equipment and in the costs of non-manual labour employed , that are associated with differences in output , are ignored , as being , in general , of secondary importance " . ' Indeed , the notion that the disinvestment in equipment is zero at the margin of production runs through a good deal of recent economic theory . But the whole problem is brought to an obvious head as soon as it is thought necessary to explain exactly what is meant by the supply price of an individual firm . It is true that the cost of maintenance of idle plant may often , for the reasons given above , reduce the magnitude of marginal user cost , especially in a slump which is expected to last a long time . Nevertheless a very low user cost at the margin is not a characteristic of the short period as such , but of particular situations and types of equipment where the cost of maintaining 1 Mr. Hawtrey ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to Prof. Pigou 's identification of supply price with marginal labour cost , and has contended that Prof. Pigou 's argument is thereb seriously vitiated. // idle plant happens to be heavy , and of those disequilibria which are , characterised by very rapid obsolescence or great redundancy , especially if it is coupled with a large proportion of comparatively new plant . In the case of raw materials the necessity of allowing for user cost is obvious ; ? if a ton of copper is used up to-day it can not be used to-morrow , and the value which the copper would have for the purposes of to-morrow must clearly be reckoned as a part of the marginal cost . But the fact has been overlooked that copper is only an extreme case of what occurs whenever capital equipment is used to produce . The assumption that there is a sharp division between raw materials where we must allow for the disinvestment due to using them and fixed capital where we can safely neglect it does not correspond to the facts ; ? especially in normal conditions where equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of equipment brings nearer the date at which replacement is necessary . It is an advantage of the concepts of user cost and supplementary cost that they are as applicable to working and liquid capital as to fixed capital . The essential difference between raw materials and fixed capital lies not in their liability to user and supplementary costs , but in the fact that the return to liquid capital consists of a single term ; whereas in the case of fixed capital , which is durable and used up gradually , the return consists of a series of user costs and profits earned in successive periods . // THE MEANING OF SAVING AND INVESTMENT FURTHER CONSIDERED I IN the previous chapter Saving and Investment have been so defined that they are necessarily equal in amount , being , for the community as a whole , merely different aspects of the same thing . Several contemporary writers ( including myself in my Treatise on Money ) have , however , given special definitions of these terms on which they are not necessarily equal . Others have written on the assumption that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitions at all . It will be useful , therefore , with a view to relating the foregoing to other discussions of these terms , to classify some of the various uses of them which appear to be current . So far as I know , everyone agrees in meaning by Saving the excess of income over what is spent on consumption . It would certainly be very inconvenient and misleading not to mean this . Nor is there any important . difference of opinion as to what is meant by expenditure on consumption . Thus the differences of usage arise either out of the definition of Investment or out of that of Income . II Let us take Investment first . In popular usage it is common to mean by this the purchase of an asset , old 74 ca.7 THE MEANING OF SAVING AND INVESTMENT 75 or new , by an individual or a corporation . Occasionally , the term might be restricted to the purchase of an asset on the Stock Exchange . But we speak just as readily of investing , for example , in a house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of finished or unfinished goods ; and , broadly speaking , new investment , as distinguished from reinvestment , means the purchase of a capital asset of any kind out of income . If we reckon the sale of an investment as being negative investment , i.e. disinvestment , my own definition is in accordance with popular usage ; since exchanges of old investments necessarily cancel out . We have , indeed , to adjust for the creation and discharge of debts ( including changes in the quantity of credit or money ) ; but since for the community as a whole the increase or decrease of the aggregate creditor position is always exactly equal to the increase or decrease of the aggregate debtor position , this complication also cancels out when we are dealing with aggregate investment . Thus , assuming that income in the popular sense corresponds to my net income , aggregate investment in the popular sense coincides with my definition of net investment , namely the net addition to all kinds of capital equipment , after allowing for those changes in the value of the old capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Investment , thus defined , includes , therefore , the increment of capital equipment , whether it consists of fixed capital , working capital or liquid capital ; and the significant differences of definition ( apart from the distinction between investment and net investment ) are due to the exclusion from investment of one or more of these categories . Mr. Hawtrey , for example , who attaches great importance to changes in liquid capital , i.e. to undesigned increments ( or decrements ) in the stock of unsold goods , has suggested a possible definition of // investment from which such changes are excluded . In this case an excess of saving over investment would be the same thing as an undesigned increment in the stock of unsold goods , i.e. as an increase of liquid capital . Mr. Hawtrey has not convinced me that this is the factor to stress ; for it lays all the emphasis on the correction of changes which were in the first instance unforeseen , as compared with those which are , rightly or wrongly , anticipated . Mr. Hawtrey regards the daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varied from the scale of the previous day by reference to the changes in their stock of unsold goods . Certainly , in the case of consumption goods , this plays an important part in their decisions . But I see no object in excluding the play of other factors on their decisions ; and I prefer , therefore , to emphasise the total change of effective demand and not merely that part of the change in effective demand which reflects the increase or decrease of unsold stocks in the previous period . Moreover , in the case of fixed capital , the increase or decrease of unused capacity corresponds to the increase or decrease in unsold stocks in its effect on decisions to produce ; and I do not see how Mr. Hawtrey 's method can handle this at least equally important factor . It seems probable that capital formation and capital consumption , as used by the Austrian school of economists , are not identical either with investment and disinvestment as defined above or with net investment and disinvestment . In particular , capital consumption is said to occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in capital equipment as defined above . I have , however , been unable to discover a reference to any passage where the meaning of these terms is clearly explained . The statement , for example , that capital formation occurs when there is a lengthening of the period of production does not much advance matters . // III We come next to the divergences between Saving and Investment which are due to a special definition of income and hence of the excess of income over consumption . My own use of terms in my Treatise on Money is an example of this . For , as I have explained on p. 6o above , the definition . of income , which I there employed , differed from my present definition by reckoning as the income of entrepreneurs not their actually realised profits but ( in some sense ) their " normal profit " . Thus by an excess of saving over investment I meant that the scale of output was such that entrepreneurs were earning a less than normal profit from their ownership of the capital equipment ; and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decline was taking place in the actual profits , so that they would be under a motive to contract output . As I now think , the volume of employment ( and consequently of output and real income ) is fixed by the entrepreneur under the motive of seeking to maximise his present and prospective profits ( the allowance for user cost being determined by his view as to the use of equipment which will maximise his return from it over its whole life ) ; whilst the volume of employment which will maximise his profit depends on the aggregate demand function given by his expectations of the sum of the proceeds resulting from consumption and investment respectively on various hypotheses . In my Treatise on Money the concept of changes in the excess of investment over saving , as there defined , was a way of handling changes in profit , though I did not in that book distinguish clearly between expected and realised results. , I there argued that change in the excess of 1 My method there was to regard the current realised profit as determining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motive force governing changes in the volume of output . Thus the new argument , though ( as I now think ) much more accurate and instructive , is essentially a development of the old . Expressed in the language of my Treatise on Money , it would run : the expectation of an increased excess of Investment over Saving , given the former volume of employment and output , will induce entrepreneurs to increase the volume of employment and output . The significance of both my present and my former arguments lies in their attempt to show that the volume of employment is determined by the estimates of effective demand made by the entrepreneurs , an expected increase of investment relatively to saving as defined in my Treatise on Money being a criterion of an increase in effective demand . But the exposition in my Treatise on Money is , of course , very confusing and incomplete in the light of the further developments here set forth . Mr. D. H. Robertson has defined to-day 's income as being equal to yesterday 's consumption plus investment , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to yesterday 's investment plus the excess of yesterday 's consumption over to-day 's consumption . On this definition saving can exceed investment , namely , by the excess of yesterday 's income ( in my sense ) over to-day 's income . Thus when Mr. Robertson says that there is an excess of saving over investment , he means literally the same thing as I mean when I say that income is falling , and the excess of saving in his sense is exactly equal to the decline of income in my sense . If it were true that current expectations were always determined by yesterday 's realised results , to-day 's effective demand would be equal to yesterday 's income . Thus Mr. Robertson 's method might be regarded as an alternative attempt to mine ( being , perhaps , a first approximation to it ) to make the same distinction , so vital for causal analysis , that I have tried // to make by the contrast between effective demand and income . ' IV We come next to the much vaguer ideas associated with the phrase " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these ? In my Treatise on Money ( vol. i. p. 171 , footnote ) I gave some references to earlier uses of this phrase and suggested that they bore some affinity to the difference between investment and " saving " in the sense in which I there used the latter term . I am no longer confident that there was in fact so much affinity as I then supposed . In any case , I feel sure that " forced saving " and analogous phrases employed more recently ( e.g. by Professor Hayek or Professor Robbins ) have no definite relation to the difference between investment and " saving " in the sense intended in my Treatise on Money . For whilst these authors have not explained exactly what they mean by this term , it is clear that " forced saving " , in their sense , is a phenomenon which results directly from , and is measured by , changes in the quantity of money or bank-credit . It is evident that a change in the volume of output and employment will , indeed , cause a change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wageunit will cause both a redistribution of income between borrowers and lenders and a change in aggregate income measured in money ; and that in either event there will ( or may ) be a change in the amount saved . Since , therefore , changes in the quantity of money may result , through their effect on the rate of interest , in a change in the volume and distribution of income ( as we shall show later ) , such changes may involve , indirectly , a change in the amount saved . But such ' Vide Mr. Robertson 's article " Saving and Hoarding " ( EconomicYournal , September 1933 , p ? 399 ) and the discussion between Mr. Robertson , Mr. Hawtrey and myself ( Economic Yournal , December 1933 , p ? 658 ) . 8o THE GENERAL THEORY OF EMPLOYMENT BK . II changes in the amounts saved are no more " forced savings " than any other changes in the amounts saved due to a change in circumstances ; and there is no means of distinguishing between one case and another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as our norm or standard . Moreover , as we shall see , the amount of the change in aggregate saving which results from a given change in the quantity of money is highly variable and depends on many other factors . Thus " forced saving " has no meaning until we have specified some standard rate of saving . If we select ( as might be reasonable ) the rate of saving which corresponds to an established state of full employment , the above definition would become : " Forced saving is the excess of actual saving over what would be saved if there were full employment in a position of long period equilibrium " . This definition would make good sense , but a sense in which a forced excess of saving would be a very rare and a very unstable phenomenon , and a forced deficiency of saving the usual state of affairs . Professor Hayek 's interesting " Note on the Development of the Doctrine of Forced Saving " ' shows that this was in fact the original meaning of the term . " Forced saving " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a conception of Bentham 's ; and Bentham expressly stated that he had in mind the consequences of an increase in the quantity of money ( relatively to the quantity of things vendible for money ) in circumstances of " all hands being employed and employed in the most advantageous manner " .2 In such circumstances , Bentham points out , real income can not be increased , and , consequently , additional investment , taking place as a result of the transition , involves forced frugality " at the expense of national comfort and national justice " . All the nineteenth-century Quarterly journal of Economics , Nov. 1932 , p. 123. 2 Loc. cit. p. 125 . Cu . 7 THE MEANING OF SAVING AND INVESTMENT 8r writers who dealt with this matter had virtually the same idea in mind . But an attempt to extend this perfectly clear ? notion to conditions of less than full employment involves difficulties . It is true , of course ( owing to the fact of diminishing returns to an increase in the employment applied to a given capital equipment ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income to those who were already employed , but an attempt to relate this loss to the increase in investment which may accompany the increase in employment is not likely to be fruitful . At any rate I am not aware of any attempt having been made by the modern writers who are interested in " forced saving " to extend the idea to conditions where employment is increasing ; and they seem , as a rule , to overlook the fact that the extension of the Bentharnite concept of forced frugality to conditions of less than full employment requires some explanation or qualification . The prevalence of the idea that saving and investment , taken in their straightforward sense , can differ from one another , is to be explained , I think , by an optical illusion due to regarding an individual depositor 's relation to his bank as being a one-sided transaction , instead of seeing it as the two-sided transaction which it actually is . It is supposed that a depositor and his bank can somehow contrive between them to perform an operation by which savings can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to investment , or , contrariwise , that the banking system can make it possible for investment to occur , to which no saving corresponds . But no one can save without acquiring an asset , whether it be cash or a debt or capital-goods ; and no one can acquire an asset which he did not previously possess , unless either an asset of equal value is newly produced or someone else // parts with an asset of that value which he previously had . In the first alternative there is a corresponding new investment : in the second alternative someone else must be dis-saving an equal sum . For his loss of wealth must be due to his consumption exceeding his income , and not to a loss on capital account through a change in the value of a capital-asset , since it is not a case of his suffering a loss of value which his asset formerly had ; he is duly receiving the current value of his asset and yet is not retaining this value in wealth of any form , i.e. he must be spending it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if it is the banking system which parts with an asset , someone must be parting with cash . It follows that the aggregate saving of the first individual and of others taken together must necessarily be equal to the amount of current new investment . The notion that the creation of credit by the banking system allows investment to take place to which " no genuine saving " corresponds can only be the result of isolating one of the consequences of the increased bank-credit to the exclusion of the others . If the grant of a bank credit to an entrepreneur additional to the credits already existing allows him to make an addition to current investment which would not have occurred otherwise , incomes will necessarily be increased and at a rate which will normally exceed the rate of increased investment . Moreover , except in conditions of full employment , there will be an increase of real income as well as of money-income . The public will exercise " a free choice " as to the proportion in which they divide their increase of income between saving and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entrepreneur who has borrowed in order to increase investment can become effective ( except in substitution for investment by other entrepreneurs which would have occurred otherwise ) at a faster rate than the public decide to increase their // savings . Moreover , the savings which result from this decision are just as genuine as any other savings . No one can be compelled to own the additional money corresponding to the new bank-credit , unless he deliberately prefers to hold more money rather than some other form of wealth . Yet employment , incomes and prices can not help moving in such a way that in the new situation someone does choose to hold the additional money . It is true that an unexpected increase of investment in a particular direction may cause an irregularity in the rate of aggregate saving and investment which would not have occurred if it has been sufficiently foreseen . It is also true that the grant of the bank-credit will set up three tendencies ? ( t ) for output to increase , ( 2 ) for the marginal product to rise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of decreasing return must necessarily accompany an increase of output ) , and ( 3 ) for the wage-unit to rise in terms of money ( since this is a frequent concomitant of better employment ) ; and these tendencies may affect the distribution of real income between different groups . But these tendencies are characteristic of a state of increasing output as such , and will occur just as much if the increase in output has been initiated otherwise than by an increase in bank-credit . They can only be avoided by avoiding any course of action capable of improving employment . Much of the above , however , is anticipating the result of discussions which have not yet been reached . Thus the old-fashioned view that saving always involves investment , though incomplete and misleading , is formally sounder than the new-fangled view that there can be saving without investment or investment without " genuine " saving . The error lies in proceeding to the plausible inference that , when an individual saves , he will increase aggregate investment by an equal amount . It is true , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the conclusion that he // also increases aggregate wealth fails to allow for the possibility that an act of individual saving may react on someone else 's savings and hence on someone else 's wealth . The reconciliation of the identity between saving and investment with the apparent " free-will " of the individual to save what he chooses irrespective of what he or others may be investing , essentially depends on saving being , like spending , a two-sided affair . For although the amount of his own saving is unlikely to have any significant influence on his own income , the reactions of the amount of his consumption on the incomes of others makes it impossible for all individuals simultaneously to save any given sums . Every such attempt to save more by reducing consumption will so affect incomes that the attempt necessarily defeats itself . It is , of course , just as impossible for the community as a whole to save less than the amount of current investment , since the attempt to do so will necessarily raise incomes to a level at which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure exactly equal to the amount of investment . The above is closely analogous with the proposition which harmonises the liberty , which every individual possesses , to change , whenever he chooses , the amount of money he holds , with the necessity for the total amount of money , which individual balances add up to , to be exactly equal to the amount of cash which the banking system has created . In this latter case the equality is brought about by the fact that the amount of money which people choose to hold is not independent of their incomes or of the prices of the things ( primarily securities ) , the purchase of which is the natural alternative to holding money . Thus incomes and such prices necessarily change until the aggregate of the amounts of money which individuals choose to hold at the new level of incomes and prices thus brought about has come to equality with the amount of money CH. 7 THE MEANING OF SAVING AND INVESTMENT SS created by the banking system . This , indeed , is the fundamental proposition of monetary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there can not be a buyer without a seller or a seller without a buyer . Though an individual whose transactions are small in relation to the market can safely neglect the fact that demand is not a onesided transaction , it makes nonsense to neglect it when we come to aggregate demand . This is the vital difference between the theory of the economic behaviour of the aggregate and the theory of the behaviour of the individual unit , in which we assume that changes in the individual 's own demand do not affect his income . s BOOK III THE PROPENSITY TO CONSUME // THE PROPENSITY TO CONSUME : I. THE OBJECTIVE FACTORS I WE are now in a position to return to our main theme , from which we broke off at the end of Book I in order to deal with certain general problems of method and definition . The ultimate object of our analysis is to discover what determines the volume of employment . So far we have established the preliminary conclusion that the volume of employment is determined by the point of intersection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The aggregate supply function , however , which depends in the main on the physical conditions of supply , involves few considerations which are not already familiar . The form may be unfamiliar but the underlying factors are not new . We shall return to the aggregate supply function in Chapter 20 , where we discuss its inverse under the name of the employment function . But , in the main , it is the part played by the aggregate demand function which has been overlooked ; and it is to the aggregate demand function that we shall devote Books III and IV . The aggregate demand function relates any given level of employment to the " proceeds " which that level of employment is expected to realise . The " proceeds " are made up of the sum of two quantities ? the sum which will be spent on consumption when employment is at the given level , and the sum which will be devoted 89 // to investment . The factors which govern these two quantities are largely distinct . In this book we shall consider the former , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on consumption when employment is at a given level ; and in Book IV we shall proceed to the factors which determine the sum which will be devoted to investment . Since we are here concerned in determining what sum will be spent on consumption when employment is at a given level , we should , strictly speaking , consider the function which relates the former quantity ( C ) to the latter ( N ) . It is more convenient , however , to work in terms of a slightly different function , namely , the function which relates the consumption in terms of wage-units ( Cw ) to the income in terms of wage-units ( Yw ) corresponding to a level of employment N. This suffers from the objection that Yw is not a unique function of N , which is the same in all circumstances . For the relationship between Yw and N may depend ( though probably in a very minor degree ) on the precise nature of the employment . That is to say , two different distributions of a given aggregate employment N between different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual employment functions ? a matter to be discussed in Chapter 20 below ) lead to different values of Yw . In conceivable circumstances a special allowance might have to be made for this factor . But in general it is a good approximation to regard Yu , as uniquely determined by N. We will therefore define what we shall call the propensity to consume as the functional relationship x between Yw , a given level of income in terms of wage-units , and Cw the expenditure on consumption out of that level of income , so that Cw = X(Yw) or C = W . X ( Y , u ) . The amount that the community spends on consumption obviously depends ( i ) partly on the amount ex. 8 THE PROPENSITY TO CONSUME : I 9 ! of its income , ( ii ) partly on the other objective attendant circumstances , and ( iii ) partly on the subjective needs and the psychological propensities and habits of the individuals composing it and the principles on which the income is divided between them ( which may suffer modification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interact and the attempt to classify them runs the danger of false division . Nevertheless it will clear our minds to consider them separately under two broad heads which we shall call the subjective factors and the objective factors . The subjective factors , which we shall consider in more detail in the next Chapter , include those psychological characteristics of human nature and those social practices and institutions which , though not unalterable , are unlikely to undergo a material change over a short period of time except in abnormal or revolutionary circumstances . In an historical enquiry or in comparing one social system with another of a different type , it is necessary to take account of the manner in which changes in the subjective factors may affect the propensity to consume . But , in general , we shall in what follows take the subjective factors as given ; and we shall assume that the propensity to consume depends only on changes in the objective factors . II The principal objective factors which influence the propensity to consume appear to be the following : ( I ) fl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously much more a function of ( in some sense ) real income than of money-income . In a given state of technique and tastes and of social conditions determining the distribution of income , a man 's real income will rise and fall with the amount of his command over labour-units , i.e. with the amount of his income measured in wage-units ; though when the aggregate volume of output changes , his real income will ( owing 92 THE GENERAL THEORY OF EMPLOYMENT BK. ni to the operation of decreasing returns ) rise less than in proportion to his income measured in wage-units . As a first approximation , therefore , we can reasonably assume that , if the wage-unit changes , the expenditure on consumption corresponding to a given level of employment will , like prices , change in the same proportion ; though in some circumstances we may have to make an allowance for the possible reactions on aggregate consumption of the change in the distribution of a given real income between entrepreneurs and rentiers resulting from a change in the wage-unit . Apart from this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defining the propensity to consume in terms of income measured in terms of wage-units. ( 2 ) fl change in the difference between income and net income. ? We have shown above that the amount of consumption depends on net income rather than on income , since it is , by definition , his net income that a man has primarily in mind when he is deciding his scale of consumption . In a given situation there may be a somewhat stable relationship between the two , in the sense that there will be a function uniquely relating different levels of income to the corresponding levels of net income . If , however , this should not be the case , such part of any change in income as is not reflected in net income must be neglected since it will have no effect on consumption ; and , similarly , a change in net income , not reflected in income , must be allowed for . Save in exceptional circumstances , however , I doubt the practical importance of this factor . We will return to a fuller discussion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net income in the fourth section of this chapter . ( 3 ) Windfall changes in capital-values not allowed for in calculating net income. - These are of much more importance in modifying the propensity to consume , since they will bear no stable or regular relationship to the amount of income . The consumption of the // wealth-owning class may be extremely susceptible to unforeseen changes in the money-value of its wealth . This should be classified amongst the major factors capable of causing short-period changes in the propensity to consume . ( 4 ) Changes in the rate of time-discounting , i.e. in the ratio of exchange between present goods and future goods. ? This is not quite the same thing as the rate of interest , since it allows for future changes in the purchasing power of money in so far as these are foreseen . Account has also to be taken of all kinds of risks , such as the prospect of not living to enjoy the future goods or of confiscatory taxation . As an approximation , however , we can identify this with the rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spending out of a given income is open to a good deal of doubt . For the classical theory of the rate of interest , ' which was based on the idea that the rate of interest was the factor which brought the supply and demand for savings into equilibrium , it was convenient to suppose that expenditure on consumption is cet. par . negatively sensitive to changes in the rate of interest , so that any rise in the rate of interest would appreciably diminish consumption . It has long been recognised , however , that the total effect of changes in the rate of interest on the readiness to spend on present consumption is complex and uncertain , being dependent on conflicting tendencies , since some of the subjective motives towards saving will be more easily satisfied if the rate of interest rises , whilst others will be weakened . Over a long period substantial changes in the rate of interest probably tend to modify social habits considerably , thus affecting the subjective propensity to spend ? though in which direction it would be hard to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of short-period fluctuation in the rate of interest is not likely , however , to have much direct influence on spending either way . 1 Cf. Chapter 14 below . // There are not many people who will alter their way of living because the rate of interest has fallen from s to 4 per cent , if their aggregate income is the same as before . Indirectly there may be more effects , though not all in the same direction . Perhaps the most important influence , operating through changes in the rate of interest , on the readiness to spend out of a given income , depends on the effect of these changes on the appreciation or depreciation in the price of securities and other assets . For if a man is enjoying a windfall increment in the value of his capital , it is natural that his motives towards current spending should be strengthened , even though in terms of income his capital is worth no more than before ; and weakened if he is suffering capital losses . But this indirect influence we have allowed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the main conclusion suggested by experience is , I think , that the short-period influence of the rate of interest on individual spending out of a given income is secondary and relatively unimportant , except , perhaps , where unusually large changes are in question . When the rate of interest falls very low indeed , the increase in the ratio between an annuity purchasable for a given sum and the annual interest on that sum may , however , provide an important source of negative saving by encouraging the practice of providing for old age by the purchase of an annuity . The abnormal situation , where the propensity to consume may be sharply affected by the development of extreme uncertainty concerning the future and what it may bring forth , should also , perhaps , be classified under this heading . ( 5 ) Changes in fiscal policy. ? In so far as the inducement to the individual to save depends on the future return which he expects , it clearly depends not only on the rate of interest but on the fiscal policy of the Government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " income , taxes on // capital-profits , death-duties and the like are as relevant as the rate of interest ; whilst the range of possible changes in fiscal policy may be greater , in expectation at least , than for the rate of interest itself . If fiscal policy is used as a deliberate instrument for the more equal distribution of incomes , its effect in increasing the propensity to consume is , of course , all the greater . ' We must also take account of the effect on the aggregate propensity to consume of Government sinking funds for the discharge of debt paid for out of ordinary taxation . For these represent a species of corporate saving , so that a policy of substantial sinking funds must be regarded in given circumstances as reducing the propensity to consume . It is for this reason that a change-over from a policy of Government borrowing to the opposite policy of providing sinking funds ( or vice versa ) is capable of causing a severe contraction ( or marked expansion ) of effective demand . ( 6 ) Changes in expectations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of income. ? We must catalogue this factor for the sake of formal completeness . But , whilst it may affect considerably a particular individual 's propensity to consume , it is likely to average out for the community as a whole . Moreover , it is a matter about which there is , as a rule , too much uncertainty for it to exert much influence . We are left therefore , with the conclusion that in a given situation the propensity to consume may be considered a fairly stable function , provided that we have eliminated changes in the wage-unit in terms of money . Windfall changes in capital-values will be capable of changing the propensity to consume , and substantial 1 It may be mentioned , in passing , that the effect of fiscal policy on the growth of wealth has been the subject of an important misunderstanding which , however , we can not discuss adequately without the assistance of the theory of the rate of interest to be given to Book IV . // changes in the rate of interest and in fiscal policy may make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect it , whilst they must not be overlooked , are not likely to be important in ordinary circumstances . The fact that , given the general economic situation , the expenditure on consumption in terms of the wageunit depends in the main , on the volume of output and employment is the justification for summing up the other factors in the portmanteau function " propensity to consume " . For whilst the other factors are capable of varying ( and this must not be forgotten ) , the aggregate income measured in terms of the wageunit is , as a rule , the principal variable upon which the consumption-constituent of the aggregate demand function will depend . III Granted , then , that the propensity to consume is a fairly stable function so that , as a rule , the amount of aggregate consumption mainly depends on the amount of aggregate income ( both measured in terms of wageunits ) , changes in the propensity itself being treated as a secondary influence , what is the normal shape of this function ? The fundamental psychological law , upon which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from our knowledge of human nature and from the detailed facts of experience , is that men are disposed , as a rule and on the average , to increase their consumption as their income increases , but not by as much as the increase in their income . That is to say , if Cw is the amount of consumption and Y , , is income ( both measured in wage-units ) AC , , , has the same sign as AY . but is smaller in amount , i.e. dC , " is positive and less than unity . , , // This is especially the case where we have short periods in view , as in the case of the so-called cyclical fluctuations of employment during which habits , as distinct from more permanent psychological propensities , are not given time enough to adapt themselves to changed objective circumstances . For a man 's habitual standard of life usually has the first claim on his income , and he is apt to save the difference which discovers itself between his actual income and the expense of his habitual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to changes in his income , he will over short periods do so imperfectly . Thus a rising income will often be accompanied by increased saving , and a falling income by decreased saving , on a greater scale at first than subsequently . But , apart from short-period changes in the level of income , it is also obvious that a higher absolute level of income will tend , as a rule , to widen the gap between income and consumption . For the satisfaction of the immediate primary needs of a man and his family is usually a stronger motive than the " motives towards accumulation , which only acquire effective sway when a margin of comfort has been attained . These reasons will lead , as a rule , to a greater proportion of income being saved as real income increases . But whether or not a greater proportion is saved , we take it as a fundamental psychological rule of any modern community that , when its real income is increased , it will not increase its consumption by an equal absolute amount , so that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unusual ? change is occurring at the same time in other factors . As we shall show subsequently , ' the stability of the economic system essentially depends on this rule prevailing in practice . This means that , if employment and hence aggregate income increase , notall the additional employment will be required to satisfy the needs of additional consumption . 1 Cf. p. zsi below . // On the other hand , a decline in income due to a decline in the level of employment , if it goes far , may even cause consumption to exceed income not only by some individuals and institutions using up the financial reserves which they have accumulated in better times , but also by the Government , which will be liable , willingly or unwillingly , to run into a budgetary deficit or will provide unemployment relief , for example , out of borrowed money . Thus , when employment falls to a low level , aggregate consumption will decline by a smaller amount than that by which real income has declined , by reason both of the habitual behaviour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is the explanation why a new position of equilibrium can usually be reached within a modest range of fluctuation . Otherwise a fall in employment and income , once started , might proceed to extreme lengths . This simple principle leads , it will be seen , to the same conclusion as before , namely , that employment can only increase pari passu with an increase in investment ; unless , indeed , there is a change in the propensity to consume . For since consumers will spend less than the increase in aggregate supply price when employment is increased , the increased employment will prove unprofitable unless there is an increase in investment to fill the gap . IV We must not underestimate the importance of the fact already mentioned above that , whereas employment is a function of the expected consumption and the expected investment , consumption is , cet. par. , a function of net income , i.e. of net investment ( net income being equal to consumption plus net investment ) . In other words , the larger the financial provision which it is thought necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the less favourable to consumption , and therefore to employment , will a given level of investment prove to be . When the whole of this financial provision ( or supplementary cost ) is in fact currently expended in the upkeep of the already existing capital equipment , this point is not likely to be overlooked . But when the financial provision exceeds the actual expenditure on current upkeep , the practical results of this in its effect on employment are not always appreciated . For the amount of this excess neither directly gives rise to current investment nor is available to pay for consumption . It has , therefore , to be balanced by new investment , the demand for which has arisen quite independently of the current wastage of old equipment against which the financial provision is being made ; with the result that the new investment available to provide current income is correspondingly diminished and a more intense demand for new investment is necessary to make possible a given level of employment . Moreover , much the same considerations apply to the allowance for wastage included in user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually made good . Take a house which continues to be habitable until it is demolished or abandoned . If a certain sum is written off its value out of the annual rent paid by the tenants , which the landlord neither spends on upkeep nor regards as net income available for consumption , this provision , whether it is a part of U or of V , constitutes a drag on employment all through the.life of the house , suddenly made good in a lump when the house has to be rebuilt . In a stationary economy all this might not be worth mentioning , since in each year the depreciation allowances in respect of old houses would be exactly offset by the new houses built in replacement of those reaching the end of their lives in that year . But such factors may be serious in a non-static economy , especially
