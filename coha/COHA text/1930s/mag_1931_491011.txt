FINit a genius , whatever else he is , Herbert onv er has broken precedents all his life . This among ethers : He has made good the old political midi line , exploded from a thousand platforms : " I stand on my record . " When the young and unknown American engineer was suddenly loaded with the responsibility for feeding an invaded nation , he became a fascination and an irritation to all the American correspondents . He was easily accessible ; some of the reporters who bombarded him for copy became his friends and even his lifelong followers . He would discuss with them the difficulties and details of his singular job , take them into his confidence regarding his amazing diplomatic difficulties . That , however , did not fully satisfy the press . They wanted to know how he lived , what he ate for breakfast , what he thought of marriage and divorce ; they wanted narratives of his twenty years on the frontiers of five continents . There , Hoover built a barbed-wire barricade . " The job 's the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formula . " Hoover 's damned modesty , " became a stock phrase with our war correspondents . Now . modest though he be , that , I think , was not his motive . lie despises bunk , personal drama . To succeed by virtue of a smile , a clinging handshake , back-slapping , personal publicity or a trick of storytelling jarred his imbued , inherent , almost passionate sense of truth and sincerity . " The job 's the thing " ? he persisted in that course even to the Presidency . And now , notwithstanding the white light which beats on the White House , his public acts and public policies have veiled a trifle the picture of a simple and readily understandable man . Let me try to draw Herbert Hoover as I see bins from a background of long experience . The type first ; the outlines of the picture before the painter begins to fill in the fine touches which make the portrait individual . Hoover was bred and nourished in a sect never before represented in the White House . The same is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is an engineer . And he runs true to form in both categories . Ingrained Quaker Qualities N OW , the man of average experience has no an'll-11 rate or definite picture of either type . Let us take Wilson , by contrast . " Presbyterian " and " schoolmaster " we called him . Nearly all of us know a deacon or so of the Presbyterian Church . If we do n't a flood of interesting and profoundly astute literature has been telling us for three hundred years what Presbyterians are like . " Schoolmaster "  - -  of course , we all know schoolmasters ! Say these words and the broad outlines of your picture create themselves ; you have only to fill in the fine strokes . But say " Quaker " to the average man and he sees an antique  --  an individual in gray clothes and a broad-brimmed hat who talks a curious Scriptural lingo and wo n't fight . A Quaker in a dinner coat  --  there the mind of the average citizen registers blankness . Similarly with " engineer . " That is a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier and the priest are as old as civilization ; this craft has found itself fully only during the past two generations . Few , comparatively , have ever known an engineer ; and , except for doll figures in the movies or superficial fiction , literature has ignored the type . The public in general thinks that he is just a fellow who works with figures and slide rules and blue prints  --  accurate stuff . First , Hoover 's ingrained Quakerism  --  that will explain much . The modern Quaker type is different and definite . Long ago , The Society of Friends gave up their peculiar dress . The little language of " thee " and " thou " they use seldom , and then only among themselves . They object as much as ever to war of aggression , domination and exploitation . They fought in the Revolution ; with increasing numbers in the Civil War  --  Herbert Hoover 's uncles , for example . And Dy WELL ERW.1111-the colleges of The Society of Friends had more alumni and undergraduates in the World War than the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of grace . They are taught from earliest childhood that fist fighting is brutal and wicked , and gets nowhere . Yet Quaker boys  --  setting their acts at variance with their doctrines , as most of us do  --  probably fight as much as any other of our young barbarians . Many President Hoover a time the little Hoover boys returned home flushed with victory and scarred with battle to face a lecture and a spanking . The average Quaker of my acquaintance is a valiant fighter in matters of the mind and spirit . Only , the Quaker methods of fighting , inherited from the days when this nonviolent sect was resisting a century of persecution , are so subtle as often to escape attention and to defy analysis . There 's an old Iowa story of a Quaker farmer whose cow kicked the milk bucket into his face . He arose dripping , and said gently : " I 'll not beat thee , I 'll not kick thee , but I will twist thy damn tail ! " Perhaps that gives a glimmer of the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light ; gone with silence to the God dwelling in their awn souls for consolation in crises , for guidance in daily life . That characteristic , most of all , has survived the era of the broad brim . They live much within , are most silent when they mean most . Those who , like Hoover , derive from strict . old-fashioned Quaker colonies , dwelt in childhood among companions trained to a kind of exquisite spiritual courtesy in which harsh deeds and words had no place . Hoover , in spite of his strong views on men and affairs , has said many times that no man in public life should say of another the thing which can not be forgiven . That is part of the Quaker in him . fin Engineer 's RealJob T E habit of looking within has bred in them a quality to which I can give no better name than sensitiveness . Yet it is not exactly sensitiveness in the accepted meaning of the word ; more a shy elusiveness of a soul which is tough-fibered nevertheless . Usually it produces a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he who has this temperament instinctively shuns the theatrical . Finally , those who best know The Society of Friends have remarked on another curious quality  --  their profound , iron-bound persistence . " I do n't know what it is in the background of the sect which causes it , " one of them remarked once , " but it 's in every real Quaker I ever knew . " " Engineer " ? when you use that word you do not cut so deeply into human character as when you say " Quaker . " Yet the engineer is a very definite type . On that , let us take testimony from Hoover himself . " It 's a mistake , " he said once , " to think of a modern engineer as dealing solely with blue prints or designs . Technicians do that . Most engineers have their eyes always on an executive or administrative job . " Equipment for an administrative job is the essence of the engineer 's education in college or technical school . During the period of his apprenticeship he may work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the vivid experience of human toil , but that is only preliminary training for directing labor itself . Hoover , for example , never designed a bridge or superintended the construction of one , but he has administered the construction of railroads which involved many bridges . More and more in our time the administration of big industrial enterprises // has fallen into the hands of trained and experienced engineers . Directing , coordinating  --  that is the engineer 's place in our scheme of material things , and the rise of this craft to strategic positions in industry is a main reason for increased industrial efficiency in America during the past quarter of a century . The engineer administrator deals all , his life with facts . Cold truth is his working creed . He leaves nothing to guesswork or hunches or instinct . If he does , he is an imperfect engineer . When he undertakes a eonstruetiou job  --  an extension of a factory , or any other new , big piece of work  --  he begins with the facts : costs calculated to a mill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that other , deterioration , special conditions , markets . In his daily jog , he stops twenty times a day to check up the work of the plant or the progress of his construction against the fundamentals . Beginning his work only after he knows all the facts that are Lobe known becomes in time an instinct with a real engineer . In the Bright Lexicon of an Engineer T HAT is the professional side . But the mental and moral sides have escaped most observers . Among all the learned crafts and professions , engineering keeps nearest to the people in their normal moments and moods . A doctor has close touch with humanity , of course . But after all , he sees them in their abnormal periods . The lawyer is mostly dealing with people in their times of trouble and dramatic crisis . But the engineer meets men  --  and men in masses  --  while they are at that . day 's work which is the main , normal stuff of life for most of humanity . He has to know the peculiarities of the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . He has to be on the watch for the exceptional individual who deserves promotion and whose promotion will improve the job , regardless of that man 's background or origins . The engineer who understands his business is putting democracy into action . Also  --  since he must keep contact with the details of the job  --  he knows humanity intimately on the personal side . He understands that the reason why Jim , in the office , has temporarily lost interest is that Jim 's in love . He sits beside a lathe with the foreman and learns how Johnny is getting along in school or how Mary is convalescing from measles . For knowledge of normal , undramatic human nature , there is no school like engineering . And Hoover himself has added years most of them go to far places on what the rest of theworld would call adventures . But to is degree which strikes the lay man as almost humorous , they repudiate the bare idea that they are in any sense adventurers or figures of romance . You have adventure , they poin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like earthquake , fire or flood , has intervened to disturb things , or when someone along the lino has done a had job . They are equally and rightfully resentful of the idea that their language of facts precludes sentiment and Generally , indeed , I have found them intense , practical idealists , glowing within over the thought that the dam or bridge or new factory is adding its bit to the heritage of mankind , leaping at an opportunity for the kind of service which expresses itself not in words but in deeds and traffic with hard facts . The bigger and more foresighted of them go farther than that  --  they follow the vision of a new world where sentiment and patriotism shall still inspire the motives of men , but cold , scientific recognition of facts shall infuse their methods . So there are the rough outlines : the Quaker and the engineer as Quakers and engineers really are . And Hoover , I repeat. , runs true to both types . The Quaker in Herbert Hoover is cause of his inherent reserve , . which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which alternately dismays and amuses his friends . Only they understand , for example , the psychology of an episode at the World 's Series of 1929 . As chief of the baseball nation and as a fan in his own right , he was delegated to toss out the first ball . He made a wild throw . Now , none of the reporters who grew witty over this episode thought to look up his athletic record . He is the only President of the United States , except perhaps Wilson , who ever developed any skill as a baseball player . He served creditably as shortstop on the Stanford ' 95 freshman team , and retired from the will be recorded that battles which his enemies and adversaries won in words and seemed to have won in fact were really Hoover victories . He has all the tough-fibered Quaker persistence . He carries an idea or an ideal through years and years , submerging it sometimes For long periods , so that one thinks he has forgotten or abandoned it ; hauling it again to the light when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testify personally , when Walter Page asked him to undertake the relief of Belgium , the consideration which most moved him to accept was the condition of the Belgian children . That motive runs through all his war work . He becomes Secretary of Commerce . In that job he finds time to organize work for child welfare , protection and health . He goes on to the White House . One of his first unheralded acts in that capacity is to put on foot the comprehensive expert study which led to the Confer-en cc on Child Welfare of last year . As he never forgets anything essential , so he never quite abandons pursuit of his fundamental , inherent ideas or ideals . Under the Reserve another detail to the picture : " Construction is their great commandment , " be said recently . " And the word ' destruction ' is n't in their lexicon . " Almost as much as professional soldiers , professional engineers have the habits of command and of physical courage . In their apprentice game afterward only because of a broken finger and pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered promising varsity material . But when he had suddenly to perform in the face of fifty thousand intent spectators , his reserve got him . Quaker also is his habit of falling into unexpected silences , oven during a conference or a lively conversation , as though some chance word had touched off a train of thought or started a spiritual vibration which he must have out alone with himself . And most Quaker of all , perhaps , is the Hoover way of fighting  --  neither beating them nor kicking them , but twisting their damn tails  --  and staying with it until he gets the mills . Twenty years hence , when history begins to see these times in perspective , it Ow we come to the smaller details , the variations from type , which round out and make individual any human character . First , the Quaker shell of re-serve . In his case it cloaks a nature warmly , sensi-tively human and affectionate  --  even sentimental . Indeed , I wonder sometimes whether he could have lived so long and intensely , worked so hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even in public , where it is most remarked , this shell cracks at times : it vanishes into thin air in. the presence of his intimates . An old friend of his has told me a tiny but illuminating episode of the days when the presidency was now to Hoover . This man had an appointment in the presidential office . Just before his hour ' a large delegation came visiting ; he got permission to go in with them . Hoover emerged , tired from a long day 's work , with the heavy , ( Continued on Page 85 ) detached air of a man who has problems on his mind . He looked up absently , caught sight of his friend in the back row , and the Hoover smile broke out . That smile of Hoover 's baffles the lens ; but then , he is one of the poorest-known subjects for photography . " It ht the room as though he had turned on a searchlight , " said the narrator . There , for an instant , stood revealed the real Hoover . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He can show under pressure the irritation of genius , and take the sting out of it a moment later by a laugh or a kind word . He has , like all fighters , a temper which can both smolder and blaze . His ordinary conversation is entirely undecorated . But at times I have heard him express himself in language which justified his years on frontiers . An instance illustrates two sides of him . Once , during the war , we made a long railway journey together . Now that he is President of the United States it is not diplomatic to mention the country . But its dignitaries had met him at the border , offered him the freedom of the country , escorted him in state to his sleeping car . And there the conductor , by an ingenious system of piracy too long for description in detail , charged us three times over for our berths . We could do nothing but . pay . The alternative was to be dumped off at a way station , and Hoover was heading for a most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indulge the luxury of expressing himself to the conductor , in terms that attained genius , concerning that sinful man 's ultimate end . And to me , when he had finished , he said : " That triple-decked buccaneer is about to lose his scalp . The manager of the company which owns these sleeping cars happens to he a friend of mine . I 'm working with him just now , feeding Belgium . When he hears about this performance , you can bet he 'll act . " Three weeks later I met him again . " Did you get that conductor fired ? " I asked . " No , " said Hoover with a drawling mildness . " The few dollars he lifted from me do n't loom very large in the scheme of this war , do they ? " Then , as though ashamed to think that he had drawn without shooting , he added hastily : " I 'd hate to have any man lose his job in these bad times  --  especially for something he did to me. " fin Engineer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hoover , the engineer . It may be necessary to digress at this point . Certain opponents tried to prove in the campaign of 1928 that he was never much of an engineer . " What bridge or dam did he ever build ? What canal did he ever dig ? " asked one of them . As I think I have shown already , that is like asking the president of a great industrial enterprise what drill he has pounded today , what rivet he has driven . Almost every ambitious engineer aims to reach the presidency of his company , or at least that eminence where he sits at some central point directing others . Hoover attained that before he was thirty . Until then , he had worked in the field  --  sinking shafts and installing reduction works in Australia and California and Arizona , constructing mining plants . and railroadsin China . Afterward , ho planned enterprises for subordinates to execute , himself shooting halfway across the world now and then to look over the ground and inspect the work ; or he reported as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then , in casual conversation , he slips a fact which proves the breadth of his experience as expert , Coming up from South America in 1928 , the party around him fell to discussing the great iron deposits in Western Brazil , useless for the present because South America has no coking coal . Suddenly Hoover came in with a correction of some loose statement , and proceeded to deseribe the deposit  --  its extent , its richness , its chemistry , the railway problem of getting the ore out . to tidewater . " I reported on that . proposition back before the war , " he added , " from the data of experts on iron , shipping , railways and markets , of course . I concluded that unless the price of iron ore on the European market should go up permanently twenty-five or fifty cents a ion , it could not be worked and shipped at a profit . " On the Road to Mandalay Like any other good engineer , he scorns officially the imputation that his craft is romantic . Privately , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roving life is always just round the corner for him . And sometimes , as though caught off his guard , he launches forth into tales of old days . Unusual episodes interlarded with technical detail . It is raw material for a Kipling . Here appended is the tag end of a story which he told me years ago . The scene is that great mining and metallurgical works a hundred and fifty miles above Mandalay in the Burmese jungle , where Hoover enhanced his reputation by solving some exceedingly difficult technical problems . 1 will omit the preliminary passages of the story , interesting though they he  --  a tiger hunt and some most ingenious mining engineering on the part . of an American outfit suddenly dumped into this wilderness  --  and put him on the air when he plunges into the human side of the narrative : " Meantime , we 'd cleaned out the jungle and found housing for a town that grew in time to twenty-five thousand . We had to stamp out malaria , which was a great bother to us in the beginning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of engineering , even sanitary and relief . We paid high wages , and that came near causing a lot of trouble ! The Chinese across the border got onto the bonanza . There followed a regular gold rush our way . We 'd have been swamped with beggars if the government had n't sent up a guard and closed the frontier on its own initiative . " As it was , we felt . humanly obliged to take relief measures for the people  --  virtually refugees  --  assembled up there . Most of them had started without a cash in their pockets or a pound of food , and they were just starving . " We had to run in a railway one hundred miles from the main line to Mandalay , through thick tropical jungle and over precipitous ranges . The biggest problem of all was building a bridge across a considerable river with steep banks . " The native Shane in that region were steadfast in the superstition that no one could build a bridge over that ( Continued ors Page 89 ) THE SATURDAY EVEN:NG POST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be drowned . They believed that certain spirits called ' gnats ' plied up and down stream in the air above the gorge ; and that these gnats ' would take vengeance on anyone attempting to interrupt their lines of communication . The point at which the river had to be bridged presented unusual difficulties . Owing to the rapid current , the steep banks and other factors , it was not possible to get in the usual falsework which supports a span during the period of construction . Our outfit . had to set up the span on the bank and , using a donkey engine , wire ropes and other paraphernalia , haul it across . It traveled on rollers as long as it lay on the ground ; when it began to protrude over the stream , we kept it from falling by using a false tail loaded down with cement blocks . " We had in charge of the bridge construction a young engineer whom I 'll call Baird . It was his first job of importance , and he felt that all the responsibility of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this span across , and in this unusual way , without dropping it into the water . Such an accident would have cost months of delay in getting a new span from Pittsburgh , and it would have reflected on his engineering skill . " When the day came for moving the span to a point above its bed and dropping-it into place by removing the blocks from the false tail , Baird was under great nervous strain ; also , it was terribly hot . The rest of our outfit was almost as nervous ; and they were thinking of another thing . The Shuns were sitting on the bank , watching . If anything happened amiss , they 'd believe that the ' gnats ' had done it , and we could never get a native to work on that section of the line again . But everything went exactly according to program . The bridge landed within half an inch of its appointed place and the boys literally danced with triumph and relief . " In order to lighten the span as much as possible , we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a skeleton of ironwork . As soon as it landed in place , Baird climbed onto one of the top girders and started to run across . He had spent most of his young life elimbing over steel skeletons , and had always maintained that . these pathways were less dangerous than city sidewalks . But this time , when he was halfway across , he stumbled , pitched off , struck the bottom girders , bounced and fell into the river far below . " . R Victim of the " Gnats " " Baird 's assistant had been a naval captain  --  a man of great resolution and courage and of varied capacities . The captain ran to the rapids below , plunged in and grabbed the floating body . On landing , he found that Baird , though still alive , had broken several ribs , a leg and a collar bone , besides other damage . The captain  --  there being no regular medical help within two hundred miles  --  proceeded to set the bones and to make Baird as comfortable as possible while a speeial train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patient over , the doctor expressed the opinion that he might live if he was spared further surgery . As a matter of fact , Baird did get well . " As soon as the captain could leave Baird , he completed another job . In high appreciation of the possibilities of the situation , he summoned all the natives thereabout and made them a speech . He explained that the ' gnats ' had talked to him when he was down in the river . They had their victim , they said . Now , they were content . From that time on , the bridge would be a perfectly safe and sound highway for man . And the natives believed hirn ! " As soon as Baird was able to talk , I asked him how on earth he , who was as sure-footed as a goat , happened to fall of that bridge just at that critical time . He said only this : The " gnats " got me . ' " When He Takes His Pen in Hand Written language is not a characteristic mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other learned professions . Here again , Hoover varies from the pattern , but this variation comes by hard , conscious effort , not by nature . Always , when he was in his narrative vein , he talked well and vividly , with an infusion of humor . There never lived the old Westerner who did n't . When he talked business , he was often oddly hesitant , as though feeling for the exact word to convey the important meaning . Writing he had to learn for himself . Many times he has expressed . regret that the necessities of poverty limited him to very skimpy and casual preparation for college , kept his nose to the grindstone earning his own living during all his undergraduate days . He began to repair this cultural flaw early in his career . During his world wandering to far frontiers , books of pure literature went . in his camp kit and saddlebags , along with history and economics . He did his ' Prentice work at writing in his two early technical treatises ; the last chapter of Principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the time he came to his preface to his and Mrs. Hoover 's translation of Agrieolo , he had acquired a fine , clear and varied expository style . When , in 1914 , life so oddly thrust world prominence upon him , he had to begin expressing himself , its speeches and papers , on contemporary affairs . This was new ; he fell to experimenting . There was a nobility , a breadth of thought , behind all he had to say , but he marred it. , clogged it , sometimes partly hid it , through his experimental reaching for accurate expression . In his famous brush with Lloyd George early in the war , when he saved Belgian relief from annihilation at the hands of the British militarists , he clinched the matter by saying : " It would be a cynical thing , would it not , if , when your armies entered Belgium , they found all the inhabitants dead ? " The thought . was fine , effective ; it won the debate . But a purist would have said that " ironic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word . Indeed , I have heard a purist argue that very point with Hoover , and the author of the line stoutly maintained his position . " ' Ironic ' is not so convincing , " he said . As years went on , he began to smooth out his experimental reachings for higher expression , His later papers as Secretary of Commerce show a general loosening up , as though he were beginning at last to find himself at home on white paper . Ile even dared , in his famous essay on fishing , to express that whimsical humor which . is one of his private qualities . These grew into the noble , original and smoothly expressed doeuments of his presidency , like his acceptance speech at Palo Alto , his King 's . Mountain address . Finally ; , in his address . to the Child ' Health Conference , he began at last to reach the iaststage of literary expression and bring to the surface his particular and deeper self . These papers , mind , are Hoover 's own ; he writes them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing marl that he really belongs to the tribe . Sometimes he dictates the skeleton , afterward amending it and slashing it to pieces in a hand that grows more and more illegible as the frenzy of composition increases . Sometimes he turns it all out laboriously with a lead pencil . " Different from anything else he has delivered since he came to the White House , " said an opposition journal , in apparent amazement , on the day after his Child Health address . Different , perhaps , because for the first time he was fully revealing one of the deepest springs of his emotional nature  --  a vision of America which has in it the paternal quality . Perhaps , if we could analyze him and X-ray him , we should find this quality explaining why all his early public career stood so synonymous with benevolence  --  the father in him expressing itself in action . But here again you meet a personal variation . They say that he scarcely notices babies during that early stage which moves women to spasms of soft . emotion . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this strange world round them . When he steps out suddenly into a group of miscellaneous ages , his eyes keep wandering to the children . I have seen him stop at the door of a Louisiana farmhouse , during a day full of work and anxiety , to discuss with a. tiny girl the question of repairs on her broken doll ; I have caught him squatting in a road playing jaekstraws with a little boy who had , of course . not the slightest idea who his playmate was . He has that way with children which is a mystery to most men , including me . He woos them , and they follow him , bewitched . This story of the younger Hoover , told once by Mrs. Hoover , illustrates that trait and a number of others , R Little Terror Named Luella " We were traveling down the China Coast in a little basket of a steamer . The quarters were uncomfortable and the weather villainously hot . We had a Dutch captain , a Chinese crew , and passengers of almost every known human variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether British or American I forget  --  traveling with her two children , a boy and a girl .

The boy himself was a handful , but Luella had her mother beaten . That child permeated the voyage . We talked about little else . " We reached Hong-Kong and stood off waiting for the passengers to conic aboard . The younger element was dancing on deck . Luella hung about watching them .

Bert picked her up , kicking and wriggling , carried her down to the cabin which she occupied with her brother , put her inside and said : ' When you get tired of crying , you can go to bed . ' It was n't necessary to undress her . In that heat she was wearing only a single garment . She tried to rush the door , which opened outward . Bert got a ehair , put it against the door , and lit his pipe . For two hours he sat and smoked outside , looking very grim , and Luella bawled and banged at the door inside .

Being Dutch , he refused to feel disturbed . So the more indignant , or the braver , formed a posse and descended on Bert . They found him smoking and meditating . Luella , inside , was doing her very best at that moment . When they explained in blunt English what they 'd come for , he took his pipe out of his mouth to remark : ' She is n't being hurt ; and if you 'd known that child for a week as I have , you 'd understand .

When she stood before him , she said , ' Good morning . ' Bert looked . at her as though she 'd surprised him . ' Why , good morning . Luella , ' he said . ' Do you know how to cut out paper dolls ? ' No , sir , ' said Luella , putting her finger in her mouth and twisting with embarrassment . ' Well , ' said Bert , ' if you 'll get . your mother to lend you a pair of scissors , I 'll show you .

For the rest of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Hoover sense of humor is one of his elusive elements . It is humor , the quality which brings gentle , ironic smiles ; not usually wit , which sets off laughter in an explosion . When Irvin Cobb said , " I had no more privacy than a goldfish . " that was wit , readily quotable in print ; Gentlemen Prefer Blondes you must read as is whole in order to understand and to enjoy . However , now and then , Hoover flashes wit . He had occasion to meet a body of disabled European soldiers , They formed an uncertain and wavering line tied their condition became so apparent that their commander felt U necessary to apologize . " You see , " he said , " we made the mistake of letting them go to the cafes before they reported here . " " Yes , " replied Hoover , " I 'd call them the Battalion of Breath .

This goes even when he is fishing . Shy of humanity , he loves human contacts . He has a long constancy in friendship . and for a friend he will go as far as the law and his strict conscience allow . The thousand and one services winch he has done for friends , in my experience of hint , are mostly matters not to be told . Perhaps , however , the time has come for release on this one : During the spring of 191S I was holding down a minor department in Washington and Hoover was Food Administrator . It was the week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had spurred official Washington to a hysteria of work . In the midst of it all , Hoover telephoned me , asking me if I could possibly come over to see him . Before 1 could sit down , he had plunged into the affair on his mind . " Bob is in bad , " he said . He whom I call Bob is an old and valued friend of us both . Quite innocently  --  I did not have to be told that  --  he had violated a red-tape regulation for defense of the republic . And the routine people who had this matter in charge seemed determined to put him through . " What can we do to get him out of this fix ? " asked Hoover . I suggested a person high in the Government who had common sense . Hoover 's hand Clew to the telephone . Ten minutes of his logical , persuasive conversation , and Bob was out of the fix . " And nuw I must move those ships , " he said . He has always seemed to glory in finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance , and standing by them . One close observer of his life and character attributes to this fact the extraordinary loyalties which he inspires . " Never since I 've been in Washington , " says this man , " has a President come out openly and publicly in defense of a member of his Cabinet who was under fire , until Hoover did it for Wilbur . You remember , his red-hot statement to the newspapers in answer to the shale-oil charges . " Not even the strain and stress of the White House have dulled or dimmed that exquisite considerntion for associates and subordinates which is part of Hoover 's tuttive good netnners . One of his secretaries tells this story : " It was the Tuesday before Congress 0 pened ; t hove had been delays in getting the presidential message ready . The newspapers were yelling for it ; if it was held snuck longer , the Pacific ! Coast would n't have it in time to write their edit mild comment . I le 'd had several sets of proofs drawn and sent to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned that morning . It wits about , as busy a day as I over saw about the White I I nose offices . The list of callers with h appointments seemed a foot . high . The President did as much as he could in intervals of the day , and at live o'clock we both settled down to see the thing through . Seven-fifteen was the dead line , for then the President must dress for it 7:30 state dinner . The stenographers were waiting outside , in case he needed them . " He took three sets of proofs and I took three . As he went over it paragraph by paragraph , he read the comments on his sets and I read him ( hose on mine ; and he considered whether lie would accept or reject the criticisms and suggestions . He was a mile deep in a sea of concentration . " Suddenly he looked up and reached for his watch . It stuck in his pocket and he glanced at the clock . My look followed his , and I saw that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his desk and went back to work . Two seconds later the messenger entered . ' Jackson , ' said the President , without looking up , ' tell the girls we sha n't want them any more tonight . ' " Living Compendium of Knowledge Ile reads detective stories ; neatly everyone knows that about him . Therefore , one might argue that , aside from solid stuff , his literary tastes were shallow . Arid just when you 've set down that dictum , he surprises you by glowing praise of a hook whose main appeal is sheer beauty  --  like The Bridge of San Luis Rey or ( - liven Mansions . Like many men of intense intellectual life , he sleeps rather briefly ; six hours are his normal quota . He began , even in youth , to refute the old superstition that reading in bed is necessarily bad for the eyes . At fifty-six , fear of eyestrain is the least of his troubles . He explained once that since he slept only six hours , he was two hours to the good over most people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with his reading . Sometimes in periods of strain he wakes up for an hour or two in the middle of the night. ; he takes up his hook and reads until he gets sleepy again . Often this reading is systematic ; just as often it is some bookwhich , through a casual mention in conversation , has piqued his curiosity . The range is as wide as the world . Since ho has a fly-paper memory , he is peeked with curious lore . In that , he resembles Roosevelt ; only the Colonel liked to talk about it , while Hoover drops it only oceasionally and casually . Item : As the Utah brought him home from South America , the proximity of the Bermudas led him to comment on the fact that every eel in the world , of whatever variety , comes to those waters to breed ; and that the minnows , guided by some mysterious faculty of the lower mind , all swim home to the spot . from which their mothers came . Aud he went on from that to a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portrait of Jefferson started an acute dissertation on the Jeffersonian period in national life . Item : a narrative of a strange , decadent Christian sect in China , set him off on a wise monologue concerning comparative religions . Our Hardest  --  Working President Perhaps reading is the dearest of his diversions ; next , I should say , is either the give and take of good , lively and wise talk or camping and ranging out-of-doors . That last is a necessity of his being : hence the Rapidan camp . He is an exceptionally good camper . He travels light , takes hardships and hitches humorously and as they come , knows all woodcraft . His fishing is most expert .. He learned that along the tributaries of the Willamette when he was a boy in Oregon . He refuses to be bigoted about methods . When the circumstan  --  es call for bait , bait it is ; but he uses is fly with delicacy and skill . He is a lucky fisherman . Says a Washington friend : " When he was Secretary of Commerce we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Potomac . You just dropped your lines and held your poles until a fish hooked himself . No skill about that , only bull luck . Well , Hoover almost . always mime back high rod , laughing at the rest of us . " Alcohol never interested him ; good cigars interest him a great deal . Startling historical revelation : His first letter from the White House besought an intimate friend to find where and how the best cigars could be bought in quantity . Even when he was a working student at Stanford , this was his One extravagance . But he holds himself to moderation . Food interests him still more . He eats heartily , with a preference for simple dishes ; in which , however , he is an epicure . Like most other Americans , he tends to eat too fast .. He begins the day with a substantial breakfast . Since he went into the White House he has become a fiend on condition . The round of medicine ball with which he begins the day takes care of the surplus so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a definite weight . He works like a dynamo , and always did , for that matter . Perhaps I was wrong about reading being his dearest diversion ; perhaps he most enjoys tearing into the job . A veteran attache of the White House remarked the other day : " This man works twice as hard as Roosevelt and three times as hard as any other President of our time except Cleveland . And Cleveland made work for himself by insisting on doing all his writing by hand . Where he gets the vitality to do all he does , Lord knows ! " He belongs to the cult of the clean desk ; and he knows when to confine himself to the larger aspects of his job and when to go into details . For example , no other President whom I have ever known or known about kept such close , intimate touch with the progress of legislation " up on the hill . " Walter Newton , his legislative secretary , reports daily on every move at the Capitol , down to the smallest details . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the mind and creative will are blazing . Palaver and gossip  --  he likes these too  --  are for the dinner table and the smoke room . 1 have drawn the picture ; crudely enough perhaps , but as I see the original . I have ignored only one thing  --  his size and scale . A practical idealist , checking the expression of fiery impulses and benevolent emotions by a restraining wall of reserve ; an engaging , entertaining , humorous and delicately understanding friend and companion ; a dreamer and yet a worker , a fighter and yet a man of peace  --  he might be all that and still a lightweight . But like hint or dislike him , catch him in his intent , sardonic working mood or in the friendly and humorous glow of his social hours , you can not sit for ten minutes in his presence without feeling a sense of power and bigness . It is nothing he does , perhaps , and nothing he say ; just an aura . And that was true of him long before he took that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the greatest democracy . Behind the Hoover Mind A man says : " I ca n't imagine any life from now on but working with Hoover . I could n't have dreamed a few years ago that I 'd ever feel that way about any man . And yet , perhaps . I 'm at my worst in his presence . He throws me off balance , somehow . It 's  --  well , awe is the best word I can find . " A woman says , " He can sit there not moving or saying a word , but , nevertheless , I seem to be in the presence of a great dynamo which is working so quietly that it never makes a sound . " In all the hammering of the past months , not even the bitterest opponent has belittled the Hoover mind . The intellectual stature of him is too patent . It is wide thinking , it is fast , it is intuitive , it is as accurate as a die , it is flexible , it is creative . Marvelous memory and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind , looming large out of a mist , lies the Hoover soul . None has quite fathomed that . It is the one mystery about him  --  and are not all souls a mystery ? You feel merely that it is very big and very fine . Above and beyond his talent for friendship , his integrity , his constancy , his kindness in small and large ways , that soul explains to me the fanatical personal loyalties he inspires in those who work under him or with him .
