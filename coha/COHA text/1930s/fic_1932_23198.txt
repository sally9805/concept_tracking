tp , THE CAPTAIN COMES HOME A STORY BY MARYA MA-NINES N a bleak October morning the motorship Silesia sailed into Cuxhaven . The North Sea was leaden , restless , and unfriendly ; the coast a thin green-gray . Only the red tiles of the houses and some blue barrels on the fish-pier pointed the scene . Captain Fassnacht stood on the bridge in his greatcoat , surveying operations . The landing was so familiar , his subordinates so routined , that he could allow his mind to wander on other things . He thought of his waiting family at Altona , near Hamburg . And he thought of Mrs. Reid . Mrs. Reid predominated . The more he tried to jerk his thoughts into the channels of home , the more he saw Mrs. Reid 's laughing lips and the broad , bright candor of her forehead . Not that Captain Fassnacht had not met attractive women : they were unavoidable on steamer voyages . The stimulation of sea air on ladies and of ladies on the Captain had resulted in a score of pleasant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ladies ' ears ; and they , for the duration of the trip , would believe it . Some , unfortunately , believed it afterwards and kept writing to the Captain , which alarmed and irritated him . But nothing serious had happened yet , and Captain Fassnacht prided himself as much on the wisdom of his human relations as on his superior seamanship . The one , of course , helped the other : both demanded that he avoid icebergs , give warning in fogs , and keep discipline . When women reached the pleading stage and clung to his gold-banded arm , he would blow his whistle , saying , " Beautiful lady , how can you torment me so ? If I did what I wanted to do ? what I long to do  --  the morale of the staff would disintegrate . I am , alack , a figurehead ! " But Mrs. Reid was different . She was more beautiful than the rest and not at all silly . She refused to believe the Captain 's protestations of love , but returned them with equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and English , with dashes , even , of Latin , which overwhelmed the Captain . He adored the precision of Latin . In such a mouth it stormed his German heart . The trouble was that Mr. Reid was a great friend of the Captain 's . In New York , Reid had come to him and said , " Erich , my wife is going over in your boat . I 'm putting her in your charge . Take care of her and see that she behaves ! " Captain Fassnacht promised warmly . He had not seen the lady yet . It would be fun to be with Hansi and Crete ' again , to give them the dinner-favors and hear their shrieks . And , although Heino , his eldest son , was at a stage difficult for a father to understand and tolerate  --  the sullen transition of THE CAPTAIN the teens  --  his sturdy figure and steady head filled the Captain with pride . Heim would make a fine navy man . And dear Anna  --  she would have everything so warm and cozy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. . What had Mrs. Reid meant when she said , " I would like to avenge all the women who believed in you ! " ? Ah , the way that queenly white neck rose from the shoulders ! Fassnacht strode into his cabin and looked at the photographs of his wife and children : standing on the lawn in the sun ; at Hansi 's birthday party ; and one of Anna at thirty , where strands of straight fine hair escaped a heavy bun and fell on either side of her pleasant face . A good woman , a perfect mother . And fine eyes . If only her teeth had been better ! " Here you are ! ? nu , entllicht " Mrs. Reid stood in the door of his cabin , tall and dressed for shore . " I climbed over all the barricades and braved the fury of your second officer to get to you . " Fassnacht went to her , kissed her hand . " Gniidige Frau  --  if only I were not landing a ship I could show you how touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotten time to see you , but I had to say good-by . " She leaned forward and kissed the Captain square on his hard mouth . " You 're the most attractive Captain I 've ever met  --  and the biggest liar . Good-by ! " She went before the pressure of her lips had left his mouth . her perfume assailed him . Maddening , the power of that woman . One touch , one word , and his whole brain went up in smoke . It was disgusting , at his age . No , wonderful . He looked at himself in the glass . What did a woman see in him , exactly ? She saw a weathered face , with creases down the cheeks and radiating from small blue eyes , a stern fighting mouth  --  and a hat , gold-oakleaved , set at a rake . It must be the hat . Or the figure . For a German of fifty-three years , his absence of paunch was notable . A steward knocked at his door and handed the Captain a radio message . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gave a series of orders . For the next hour the business of landing passengers filled his mind . That is until he spotted the figure of Mrs. Reid making her way gingerly down the gangplank . Her slim legs teetered on the cross slats ; she was absorbed in their progress . When she reached the pier she looked up for a fleeting second at the bridge and waved indiscriminately at four visors peeking over the top of the canvas wind-break . One of them must belong to the Captain , she surmised . One did ; but its owner was powerless to prove it . Waving from the bridge was hardly in order . Fassnacht damned her . The contraction of his heart at seeing her go disturbed him . He had hoped his age would make him immune to that especial pain . Slowly the Silesia steamed down four hours of Elbe River ; of green marshes and dark red villages flattened under the cold sky . Finally the river broadened and became complicated with the works of men  --  cranes , drydocks , granaries , coal-dumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and iron and smoke , the big boat made her way into Hamburg . Captain Fassnacht finished up his duties on board , changed into civilian clothes , and made for the Line Office on the Alsterdarn . He was surprised and relieved to find his anticipation sharpened as he neared home . He made his report to the Line , joked a while with the head of the Passenger department , then got into the Altona tram . In spite of himself , and in spite of the poor districts he passed , Fassnacht kept looking out of the window in the stray hope of seeing Mrs. Reid walk by . Once he saw the back of a woman that suggested her , but the front turned out to be a blasphemy . Damn the woman . Altona . From the tram stop there was a five-minute walk to his home . He could follow it in his sleep , so trained were his feet to the alternate feel of gravel , paving , and earth , to the two rectangular turns . The big square brick house with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balconies , then  --  home . He walked up the neat white gravel path to the front door . Quatsch , the dachshund , heard his crunch first , came yapping at him from behind the house . Then Hansi and Gretel ran out from the door and jumped on him together , yelling . After them came Anna his wife , smiling , an apron on . " Father , why did you take so long ? We expected you ages ago ! " " Father , you did n't kiss me right ! " " Father , were there any bad storms ? " " Look at Quatsch , papa , he got a gray hair ! " The little blond boy and the little blonde pig-tailed girl clung to the Captain like vociferous burrs . Anna then approached the group ; and mother and father kissed gravely over the heads of the children . " Everything fine , Anna ? " " Yes , dear , everything goes well . How was the trip ? " " So-so-1 ' 11 tell you the details later . Where 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heinohe 's off looking at machines with another boy . He 'll be back by dinner . " The family went into the house , the children hanging from the Captain 's coat , their feet dragging on the gravel . Quatsch followed them in , with great dignity . Fassnacht always liked to describe that it took Quatsch five minutes to pass a door . " He 's likeone of those long barges , " he would say , " with a flag at the stern ! " How well he knew the living room ! The pervading green-brown tone , the ferns clustered in the bay-window filtering a greenish light ; the heavy plush sofa with white lace on the back , the tasseled table-cover ; the oil-portrait of his father Commandant Fassnacht , a stern man with a forked gray beard and a glitter of medals on his chest ; the innumerable photographs . On one wall hung the skin of a python some cousin of his had shot in Sumatra . It was the children 's pride and horror . He could see Mrs. Reid recoil from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laughing , from everything in the room . And yet . it pleased him . It was warm and comfortable , a good place to rest in  --  if not to think in . " We will have dinner as soon as Heino comes in , " said Anna . " I hope he is n't late , " said the Captain . " That boy needs disciplining ; he seems to be lax these days . " " I know . But it 's just a phase , Erich . One must have patience . " " Just a phase " ? how easily that explained , justified everything . But one was allowed to have phases only in one 's youth . The Captain might not say , of his feeling for Mrs. Reid , that he was passing through a phase . People would call it " his baser nature . " Why baser ? There was nothing low about the woman ; on the contrary , she had more distinction than anyone he had ever known . The door banged . " Hallo , papa ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father and gave a cheek to be kissed . " Well , Heino  --  forgot your old father was due to-day ? " " Certainly not , papa . But I did n't think you 'd be here yet . Was the trip good ? " Heino was making a brave effort , thought his mother with relief . Gesa , their very homely maid with THE CAPTAIN buck teeth and a harvest of pimples , came to the door and announced dinner . The Fassnacht family rose in a body and went into the dining room . The dining room was dark red in general tone , with massive brown furniture and a drop-light with a dark green rough glass shade over the table . The Captain sat at one end , his wife at the other . Hansi and Gretel shared one side , Heino , by right of seniority , had the other to himself . The young ones looked expectantly , adoringly at the Father ; Anna with a respect not unmixed with resignation . Heino , self-conscious , played with his fork . " Hands off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heino gave him a quick glance , dropped the fork , and put his hands in his lap . " Erich , you remember the Liebmanns ' nephew that 's gone to America ? He married that girl in Milwaukee , you know  --  well , think of it , they have a little boy ; is n't that wonderful ? " " Fine , fine , " said Fassnacht . Mrs. Reid had no children . It would be rather wonderful to have a child by Mrs. Reid , a tall , dark , brilliant daughter like her , who knew how to move and how to speak of anything with wit and sympathy . " It seems that Lisel has been suffering from it all along and they never knew what it was ? " Fassnacht switched his mind to the table . What was Anna saying ? Lisel ? Oh , yes . . . . Why did Heino keep looking at him , as if he knew ? Knew what ? Damn the boy , he was precocious , he was growing up . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children glanced at each other with pleasurable fright . Heino was certainly getting it to-night , in spite of being older . " And I told Richter , if he sold me such bad spinach once more I 'd stop dealing with him . I assure you , Erich , it was dark brawn and frostbitten at the edges . " " Awful , awful . " Dear God , dear God , what did it matter , what did all this matter when one could not have that white face near one , and watch the black sweep of lashes on the long cheek ; and hear her laughing " amor vineit cnnnia " while her hands twisted his gold buttons in mock shyness ? " Papa , did you have a big storm ? " asked Hansi , profiting by a lull in his mother 's woes . " Not a very big storm , Hansi , " said the Captain , " only little waves as high as two or three Quatschesl " " Was anybody sick ? " said Gretel . " People always are sick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I tell them ; it 's ridiculous . . " Mrs. Reid had stayed in her cabin the fourth day out . He had sent down champagne . With her , of course , it was merely fatigue ; she had looked worn out when she came on the boat . One had such a desire to help that woman , to protect her . " Did Kammer flirt as much as ever ? " asked Anna Kammer was the Chief Officer , a big Swedish-looking fellow who danced well and stared hard at anything he liked . It was Kammer who had spotted Mrs. Reid first . " There 's a hot dish , " he said in his delicate way . " Oh , Kammer 's all right , his bark is much worse than his bite . As a mat. ter of fact , he was very unhappy this trip , there were no pretty girls , only a lot of old ladies who wanted to dance with him . " Anna sniffed . " Disgusting . I ca n't understand women doing that after a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , the sea was responsible for a lot of things . But it was not entirely responsible for this agony of longing he now felt for a woman he might never see again . " What was your average speed , papa ? Did the new engines behave ? " asked Heino . " Excellent , " said the Captain , " almost twenty knots . They 're a relief after the old ones  --  although it 's partly due to Eberhard . He 's the best engineer on the line . " " Could I meet him some time ? " asked the boy eagerly . The Captain smiled patronizingly . " Certainly , my boy , certainly . Eberhard loves children , he has boys of his own . " " I 'm not a child ! " shouted Heino , furious . " Ileino ! " warned his mother . " Heino thinks of himself already as the young-man-about-town , " said Fassnacht . " It 's a shame to disillusion him , really ! " Truly , he did already look the roan  --  an attractive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong brow and Greek mouth . Mrs. Reid would admire him . " I have a passion for the potential man in boy-children , " she said once . " Who sat at your table , Erich ? " asked his wife . " Well , let 's see . There was a musician , an amusing little Jew who conducts some big New York movie orchestra , and a professor of mathematics  --  he was a fine man , we spent hours in my cabin talking  --  and an elderly lady , I forget her name  --  she has a son in the Line Office here . " " Was it Mrs. Keppel ? " asked Anna . " There 's a nice young boy called Keppel in the Office ; he 's always so respectful to me . " " T do n't know . " " Who else was at the table , papa ? " " Well , there was a young aviator who 's coming over to study Italian plane-construction , and then a lady called Mrs. Reid , the wife of a man I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " That sounds like an amusing table , " said Anna . " It was amusing . " No , it was enthralling . It was the wide free world that oscillated from the science of numbers to the pulse in a woman 's throat . It was ardent , complicated , mysterious . How could they understand ? How could they feel what he felt on the bridge at night , watching the dim white bow lift on the swelling darkness ; or straining for the first headlands to take form out of the haze ? How could they know the infinity he sailed through , these people circumscribed by a circle of warm light on a white tablecloth ? Dear heaven , this pain of adjustment every three weeks , this telescoping of the spirit ! Every three weeks this desperate contraction from the whole into one of its parts ; from the universe to No. 4 Kastanienstrasse . From Mrs. Reid to ? Anna . Fassnacht lashed himself . " Get back ! " cried his inward voice , " get back ! This is your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Give them at least these four short days . " Hansi and Gretel went to bed shortly after dinner , and Fassnacht saw them tucked in for the night . Gretel 's tight yellow braids lay out on the pillow at right angles to her head . When she kissed the Captain good-night she clung so hard that he had to pry off her small fingers and get out of their reach . Hansi was quieter ; he stared up into his father 's face , one hand clutching a dirty gray rabbit with only one ear . " Good-night , papa , " he said gravely . Pride stirred in Fassnacht 's breast as he looked down ; Anna and he had done a good job . Heino escaped to a corner of the living room with a book on wireless , while his father and mother talked , intermittently , of little things . At nine he was ordered to bed . At ten the Captain yawned . " Well , Anna  --  think I 'll turn in . It 's been a long day ! " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up her sewing . " Let 's go up. , . Fassnacht sighed . He locked the doors , put out all the lights , and followed his wife upstairs to the bedroom . In less than half an hour man and wife were lying side by side in the enormous ancestral bed . Side by side and deserts apart . It had never been a question of passion with Anna . Fassnacht , as an ambitious junior officer , had chosen her seriously and long-headedly as the logical wife for him and the best mother for his children . She came of good family , had breeding , intelligence , and great sanity . Physically she was comfortable . He liked to be near her in the same way that a man likes to be near a stove on a cold night . But with the birth of each child whatever intimacy existed between them diminished . She preferred to stroke her children 's heads rather than her husband 's . The boats they sailed in their bath-tubs interested her far more than the ships he sailed at sea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long years  --  to lie side by side , each feeling nothing but the steady warmth of the other 's body . Anna wore heavy cotton nightgowns that whispered when she moved and were dry to the touch . Fassnacht once said to her , " Anna , why do n't you get yourself a silk nightgown  --  would n't you like that ? " " Silk ? " she cried , " when the laundress goes crazy washing all the children 's things ? " Then , for some reason hurt , she had wept . If only his imagination were not so restless , so avid , the Captain moaned inwardly . If only he need not create the ghost of a mouth turned to him in the dark , of fragrant hair . " lf only this woman next to me could make meforget , could drown my phantoms in some oblivion ! " In the dark , to the rhythm of Anna 's breathing , the Captain 's brain became a hectic kaleidoscope of images and figures ; Ambrose Lightship , the geometry of stars , Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting my wife in your charge  --  see that she behaves " . . . the donkey-engine that balked in Southampton .. . the way the little Jewish conductor guzzled his beer .. . the week-end in Westchester at the end of his next trip .. . speak to Riegehnann about the forward hatch cover . . Anna must get him some more warm underwear for the winter passages .. . Round and round and round , until Fassnaeht 's bead ached with its relentless iteration of unrelated facts . His feet twitched , he turned this way and that . " Ca n't you sleep , Erich ? " " Yes , yes  --  very soon . Do n't worry about me , Anna . " " Perhaps some hot milk with a little whiskey ? " " No , thank you , dear . Go to sleep again . " Somehow the night passed . Somehow , it always did . And in the days it was always far easier to lose oneself in the immediacies of the moment . Soon the Captain was walking to the tram-stop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Quatsch . Heino was at school . Soon his feet crunched on the gravel , resounded on the paving , thudded on earth . The white house with the railings , the dark brick house . . " Do n't go , papa , let the boat sail , stay here ! " cried Gretel . " Yes , papa , let the boat go alone , " shrieked Hansi . " Are you sure you have n't forgotten anything , Erich ? " " No , dear  --  I do n't think so . " At the tram-stop they stood and waited . When the iron wheels creaked and clanked on the tracks four blocks away , Anna 's eyes moistened from habit as she kissed the Captain good-by . " Take care of yourself , Erich . Wear those heavy socks I gave you . " " Good-by , Anna dear . I 'll be back in time for Hansi 's birthday . " " Bring me a nairplane , papa ! Bring me a nairplane from America ! " Gretel climbed on his shoes . " Bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want more little hats like the ones you got last trip ! " The tram grated to a stop . Somehow the father disentangled himself , somehow he boarded the tram . " Good-by ! " " Good-by ! " The little group waved as the tram started away . " Good-by ! " yelled Gretel , running a little way after it . And there he was , once more , on the bridge of the Silesia , steaming outwards into the cold North Sea . His great coat collar was turned up around his chin , his hat cocked sideways , his legs spread . Kammer stood next to him , squinting at the choppy grayness of the sea and the sullen grayness of the sky . " Not so good , " he said . " No , " said Fassnacht . " It ought to be fairly bouncy . " " Fine for the old ladies , " muttered Kammer . Before night the storm was upon them . Sheets of water piled over the Sile , sia 's bow , boiled and eddied along the decks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the ragged sky , dishes slipped and clattered in the metal pantries . Coats hung on hooks stood stiffly out from the wall . Fassnacht wondered whether Mrs. Reid would stand such motion . He stillthought of her , yearned for her constantly . The storm lasted for two days . Very few people came to the dining room : at the Captain 's table only two out of the eight chairs were occupied , and those by two hardy sisters of fifty-odd years with puckered mouths and flat voices . The Captain cut his meals as short as possible , remembering with pangs the glamour and gaiety of the voyage over ; and the bridge , instead of being an interruption in love , became a haven from boredom . On the third day the wind abated a little , and the Silesia settled down to a slow even roll . A number of new people appeared above deck , cautiously ; and the dining room looked much fuller . When Captain Fassnacht came down the broad stairs to dinner his heart stopped dead . At his table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She looked more darkly radiant than ever in a white satin gown . She saw him coming and smiled at him . The Captain , incredulous , faint in the pit of his stomach , stared at her , slowly bowed to her , sat down . " Surprised , are n't you , Herr KapiUM ! " she said in her clear low voice . " You ! " he whispered , " You ! " " I do n't blame you for looking as if you 'd seen a ghost . " Fassnacht could not speak . His eyes were on her neck , her shoulders , her lips , alternately clearing and blurring . Blood ' minded in his head . " But I 'm not a ghost . I 'm very much here . You can pinch me if you want ! " The Captain shook his head . " Then you might disappear . " " One thing I must know , you gold-braided Satan ! Have you been faithless to me in this short time Did the charms of home obliterate me from your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he whispered . " I could have killed you . You spoiled everything in those four days  --  every-thing ! " " Darling , I spoil everything ? " " Yes , you ! You gave me bad days and worse nights . You made everything taste like sawdust . I hated you ! " " Ach , Heber Herr Kapitiin , sager. eie dos abet nicht ! If you knew how yearningly I thought of you ! " " Liar , " he grinned , cutting across the spine of his herring with needless violence , " liar ! " " I suppose I am , " murmured Mrs. Reid . " As a matter of fact , I was n't given much time to remember you in . The first night in Berlin I bumped into an old flame  --  a very possessive old flame ? . Not so old , either . " " Oh , did you ? " said the Captain . " Yes , it was very upsetting . He is n't half as nice as you , darling  --  but , not being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say  --  restrictions . And that was my undoing . " " Ah . " " Come , come , why the lengthening face ? Is n't it enough that I am actually here  --  sitting next to you ? " The barometer in Fassnacht 's heart rose . His mouth softened again . She went on , " After all , my dear , it 's hardly usual to sail back from Europe after a four days ' visit , is it ? " Mrs. Reid leaned towards him , a half-smile on her lips , her eyes unfathomable . " I suppose you 've guessed by now that this quick return is due to your  --  irresistible charm ? have n't you ? " Fassnacht , burning with excitement and bewilderment , whispered again , " You ! You beautiful darling  --  you ! " This was triumph , sang the master in him , this was male triumph . His whole body swelled with an enormous pride in power . " Well , my dear , " said Mrs. Reid , " I 'm afraid you guessed wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that would hardly make me take to this damnable sea again so soon ! " She became serious . " I got a cable in Berlin from my husband . He 's quite seriously ill . I 'm going back to take care of him . " Slowly everything became motionless inside the Captain , with the echoing stillness of a ship whose motors have suddenly stopped . " I 'm very sorry to hear that , " said his voice . " I do n't know what it is , but I know he needs me . Perhaps even more than you do , Captain ? " Mechanically , Fassnacht ordered the rest of his dinner from the attendant waiter . Mrs. Reid kept her laughing , appraising eyes on him for a moment , then suddenly waved and smiled brilliantly across the dining room to someone . " Who are you waving at , may I ask ? " said the Captain . " I 'm waving to your Chief Officer , darling . He 's such a dear . I neglected him on the way over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this trip . I do n't know any Chief Officers . " " I suppose Kammer has already told you of your charms ? " " Oh , dear no , " cried Mrs. Reid , " he 's terrified of me . Very rude too , because he thinks I 'm your property and goes out of his way to keep hands off . It 's highly amusing ! " " No doubt . " The Captain took a deep swallow of Rhine wine . " Where were you the first two days on hoard ? " " Giving up my soul in my cabin , if you must know . " " What , on that mill-pond ? " " Mill-pond ! Really , darling , I believe in understatement , but ? " Laughing , she raised her wineglass again to Kammer across the tables . So , she was sick , thought the Captain . Disgusting . His food lost all taste for him , he finished his dinner as soon as he could , wiped his mouth with deliberate finality , and rose . " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowing . " Good evening , Mrs. Reid . I must get back to work . " " But , Liebling  --  how strange of you ! Why ? " " I happen to command a ship , dear lady . I am a Captain . I am  --  restricted ! " He looked stonily into her upturned face , bowed , and strode out . His shoulders were squared aggressively , consciously . Up in his cabin , the Captain 's soul blackened with rage and hurt . " The slut ! " was all he could say to himself , with blind viciousness , " the cold slut  --  a typical American woman  --  I might have known it --  -- slut ! " The strength and tradition of his German blood and training , his conquering forefathers , his position , his power , his security  --  all crowded into a shining phalanx behind Fassnaeht 's pride . He was indomitable . He was unassailable . His judgment was keen as a compass needle . He had no doubts . He condemned the woman . Two hours later Kammer came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nordic frame seemed to have expanded , to tower . On his way to the bridge he passed the Captain 's cabin . He knocked . " Come in ! " he heard . Captain Fassnacht was sitting at his desk . On Kammer 's lips a few jovial comments on a certain lady on board were waiting to leap , but something in the Captain 's face  --  in the grouping of photographs on his desk  --  killed them . The Chief Officer stammered an apology for intrusion . " Anything wrong , Kammer ? " " No , no , Herr Kapitiin . I only just realized I 'd forgotten to ask you how your family was ? " " Fine , fine , " beamed the Captain . " My wife was in the best of form , andthe children  --  well , I must confess they struck me as among the best things I ever did ! " He laughed and rose from his chair to face Kammer . " You know , " he said , putting his hand on the Chief Officer 's shoulder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moving around and all that , but a man must have a background . " He walked back to his desk , glanced at the picture of Anna with her straight hair framing her round face . " No doubt about it , Kammer  --  a man must have a background ! " " Yes , Herr Kapitiin  --  eventually . " Smiling a little , the Chief Officer left the cabin and went up on the bridge . Fassnacht took off his clothes and made ready for bed . As he brushed his teeth he looked into the mirror . No gold-oak-leaved cap , set on a rake . Merely a hard-bitten old sea-dog with grooves in his russet skin and not much hair on the top of his square head . " Eventually , " muttered the Captain , " eventually . . . " He felt very tired and hollow , as if nothing were of use , not even the getting into bed . Once on his back in the moving and creaking dark , his brain began again : Altona . .. Anna . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good-night , papa " . . . woolen underwear . " it 's good to have a background " . . . Kammer smiling , so big . . . eventually . . cotton nightgown . . . He felt with his fingers the deepening long rats in his cheek . " I 'd like to avenge all the women who believed in you ! " Ala the contemptible woman . The bestiality of those lips  --  how degraded were the honeyed words that oozed from them ! Her laughter , how unclean . This time there was not even desire to warm his blood ! Captain Fassnacht drew the blankets tighter about him , shrank inside them . Under cold stars the Silesia shuddered on .
