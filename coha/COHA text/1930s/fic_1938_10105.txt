" Come here , child , " papa said to Jane . " Come to your old uncle Lew . " Jane obediently came forward and papa bent over and kissed her ear . A few grains of dandruff fell from the white hair to his shoulders . " She 's a pretty young un , " he said to Aunt Jane Anne . " A perfect little beauty  --  and she ai n't so little , madam , now . It wo n't be long , it wo n't be long ! " Miss Milly George cocked her head . " I always say the child was Janie 's afterthought . Why , Janie , you know you 're old enough to be the child 's grandmother and all . And all . " There was a scraping of feet on the bare floor , the first sound I had heard since papa entered the room . Papa smiled at Aunt Jane Anne while he addressed Miss Milly George . " No , no , Miss Millicent , your sister is just old enough to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and he bowed to Aunt Jane Anne . " Major , " said Aunt Jane Anne , " it do n't make any differenceabout the long journey . " She looked gentle and weary , and I saw Miss Ginnie raise her eyebrows as if to say : Has she still got that on her mind ? She went on : " We just felt so sorry for poor Susie and you know I do believe Susie herself felt sorrier for my George than she did for herself . George was mighty broken up , I tell you . Why , he  --  " She took a deep breath and fell back into her chair , looking around her with startled eyes . Everybody was looking at her . Semmes was rubbing the side of his nose , lookingcovertly at papa . " I have n't seen our George today , ma 'm , " papa said . He turned and looked around him , and drawing his free handp101to his breast he inclined his head and moved towards the door . He stopped half-way . He looked at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I went to him and he took my hand and led me out into the hall . Now I felt nothing , yet the moment had come that all this waiting had been for , but it was lost in each new movement , each new step into our places in the melancholy procession . There was of course no one moment that it was all leading up to , and that piece of knowledge about life , learned that day , has permitted me to survive the disasters that overwhelmed other and better men , and to tell their story . Not even death was an instant ; it too became a part of the ceaseless flow , instructing me to beware of fixing any hope , or some terrible lack of it , upon birth or death , or upon love or the giving in marriage . None of these could draw to itself all the life around it or even all the life in one person ; not one of them but fell short of its occasion , warning us all to fear , not death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather to fear our own expectancy of it , good or ill , or our own lack of preparation for these final things . I had to learn this : papa , leading me by the hand into the yard to take his place at the rear of the coffin , behind the six Negro pallbearers , had no need to learn nor even to understand it , for to him there could have been nothing whatever to understand . That was why , as we stood there , he could leave his place and go to old Lucy Lewis , who waited respectfully to one side , and take her brown hand to lead her into the line , and make her take her place ahead of us just behind the body of her mistress . I looked about me , anxious to start , in the foolish delusionthat people were looking at me . Over beyond the garden , I saw Uncle Armistead walking towards the graveyard , leaning on his gnarled stick , his white beard and hair blown by the breeze . The colored boy followed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rest , holding in his hand his master 's wide black hat . Except Coriolanus the Negroes were stout men but they had been holding their burden too long , and I saw Captain Corse and Cousin John , who stood with the two ministers in front of the coffin , look over our heads at the front door . It seemed long but presently Brother Charles and his Lucy came out and walking around the people near them came to us , and waited behind papa . But Cousin John was still looking at the door . Near the door people were making way and Sister Susan stood at the threshold , a black shawl gathered at the neck , her head covered with a heavy black straw hat from which fell a veil concealing her eyes and nose and mouth . In the crowd on the porch she could not see us but at last she lowered her head and came down the steps . The man who came out of the door after her was not George Posey . It was Brother Semmes . Susan took papa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who stared at her back with his usual signs of agitation , shifting from one foot to another and rubbing his long , humorous nose . Then the procession started , slowly at first and I suppose we kept a slow even pace for all the two hundred yards up the ridge , past the garden wall , the abandoned well , the gooseberry thicket , to the three big chestnut trees and the low brick wall of the graveyard . We were there so quickly I thought we must have flown . We followed the coffin through the open gate and stood before a long wooden bench set for the immediate family before the open grave . We sat down and looked straight ahead . Our friends and cousins stood outside the graveyard alongp103the wall at our backs . The servants of the family and others from neighboring farms lined the wall to the right of the white people , forming a semi-circle around the burying . I fixed my eye with careful concentration upon a glisteningspade upon which Johnson , one of the grave diggers , was leaning by the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave ; in the corner of my eye I saw Mr. Higgins , near the Negro , squatting and turning his hat round and round by its brim . His thin hair was neatly brushed over his high , flat forehead . Then I felt a hand on my shoulder . It was Aunt Myra . She must have been delayed . Withoutlooking I seemed to know that the bench was full : I was at one end by sister , so I got up and gave my place to my aunt , who said , " Thank you , honey , " and sat down . I went towards the Negroes and sat upon the edge of a recumbent tomb , a big stone slab . There was another just like it by its side . Uncle Armistead was kneeling by it , his elbows resting upon it in the attitude of prayer . His boy sat on the wall . I was aware that Mr. McBean 's voice had been soundingand sounding  --  I did n't know when it had begun , and it went on and on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye ran down the inscription that Mr. McGovern had assigned to me as a punitive lesson earlier that year . I knew it by heart but like counting sheep in the middle of the night I spelt out every word , one after another : MEMORI MARGARETAE NATAE FILIAE CORBIN LEWIS GENEROSI ET UXORI FIDELI JOHANNI BUCHAN MEDICI GENEROSI : ET NEPTIS GEORGII WASHBURN DUCIS : AETERNITATE AESTIMATA IN PACE REQUIESCAT INGENUABORN SPOTSYLVANIA COUNTY JUNE 3 , 1754 O. S. DIED FAIRFAX COUNTY DEC. 10 , 1806 N. S. Uncle Armistead suddenly said in a loud voice A-men but the interminable prayer continued into supplications for the divine mercy upon papa , sister , my brothers called by name , the servants , myself the motherless boy and at last the President of the United States who for some reason had suffered a loss . A-men muttered Uncle Armistead and I thought how easily the old gentleman keeps company with his father 's grave . He leaned upon the slab as if it were the back of a pew . I raised my eyes to the six lugubriouspall-bearers lined up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fingers interlaced , was nodding his bowed head . A-a-men , shouted Mr. McBean in a minor key , and there was a faint shuffle in the crowd as he retired a few steps to the rear , the flesh round his high , lean cheekbones flushed from his exertion . Dr. Cartwright advanced to the end of the coffin , his fat forefinger marking a place in his prayerbook . His placid gaze ranged over the congregation ; he dropped his eyes as if for a moment of silent prayer . I looked again at Uncle Armistead : he was wiping his face with a coarse linen handkerchief , his eyes , old and vague , lifted towards Dr. Cartwright . I thought it remarkablethat he and I , a nephew young enough to be his great-grandson , should be bound back , should be held in religion as I should say it now , to the long message of the dead . He prayed upon his father 's tomb and I malingered stupidly upon his mother 's grave . I found myself tracing the branches on the Tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the fine lines of foliage swayed over to one side in mournful abandon , stylized and looking like wellbrushedhair . Ah lovely appearance of death No sight upon earth is so fairp105Not all the gay pageants that breathe . Can with dear Molly compareMolly Buchan , the sister I had been born too late to see , dead of a cold draft . A strip of damp lichen covered the third verse but I knew it all by rote , knew that papa had composed the lines and had stood over Henry Jackson tellinghim how to chisel the letters upon the freestone ... . Why did Dr. Cartwright talk differently from Mr. McBean ? His words were different , he seemed to be just a voice , in the ore rotundo of impersonality , no feeling but in the words themselves . I stared at his round face . " Behold I shew you a mystery : we shall not all sleep , but we shall all be changed , in a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , at the last trump ; for the trumpet shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There was a woodpecker at his work high in the chestnut tree . I lowered my face into my hands ... " For this corruption must put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality ... " In the silence the woodpecker savagely jabbed the high limb , rapidly like a riveting hammer , as Mr. McBean came forward and said we should now sing Rock of Ages . A wavering cry went up and the Negro men , three on each side of the grave , tugged at the ropes and the coffin beganits perilous descent . I saw the black edge sink below the clods as the hymn ended , and the Negro men toss the rope-ends into the grave and stand back in respectful postures . A long thin note hung in the air , Let me hide myself in thee , and the two grave-diggers , their black arms bare and glistening , came forward and with rapid , sure scoops turned the rusting earth back into the grave . I heard with wonder the crash of the first clods , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth upon earth.  | Then they stood away from their work , and old Coriolanuscame forward with a flowery pall and carefully fitted it over the mound . When he had risen , papa rose and went to him and took him by the hand and with his left hand touched the old Negro 's shoulder . He turned back to face the family , his lips softly compressed ; the family got up from the bench and followed him out through the gate between the rows of relations and friends , and the procession returned upon itself , whither it had begun . I was at Aunt Myra 's side , but when we came opposite the garden I broke away and getting out of sight behind the garden I ran to the back of the house in order to be there first . On the lower back gallery at the door into the back hall , I stopped . What had I been running for ? I pushed the door open and tip-toed through the hall to the door of the chamber , which was open , ran in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strap . As I got up I was startled . Old Mrs. Gunnell sat in mother 's chair , her eyes closed ; a fly was running up and down her nose . I held my breath . She moved her head and with relief I stuffed the strap into my pants pocket and went quietly out into the hall . I looked into the hollow front parlor but avoided it . I went through the hall to the door into the back parlor . It was open , and directly across the room lay Mr. Broadacreon the long horsehair sofa , breathing stertorously , one hand dangling limp upon the bare boards . Sniffing , I caught the fumes at that distance . I entered the room . George Posey was standing in the far corner by the window , looking towards the garden at the returning mourners . Outside the sun was high on the trees and the room was a soft shadow in which I could see the handsome profile of my brother against the fading light of the win/dow . He had not seen me ; so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches upon the floor . He turned his head and stared at me inquiringly . I waited for him to speak but he said nothing , only stared , and I wanted to leave him but I could not . I fingered the back of the chair . " Well , you came back , did n't you , Brother George ? " I could n't help it , it was not malice ; yet the devil moved my tongue . His eyes narrowed . " Yes , I came back . " He turned again to the window . He put his thumb under his chin and without looking at me or moving in the least he said , " I ca n't even remember their names . " He turned to me once more . " I meet them but I do n't know who they are , " he said with a rising voice . " And by God they 'll all starve to death , that 's what they 'll do . They do nothing but die and marry and think about the honor of Virginia . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I want to be thrown to the hogs . I tell you I want to be thrown to the hogs ! " Mr. Broadacre suddenly sat up and rubbed his eyes . " Has somebody been speaking ? " he said . Brother George gave him a swift glance , then said to me : " Come here , Lacy . " I went to him and looking into his lace , which had been dim from across the room , I saw in it what can only be called fear . " Lacy , " he said in a whisper , " I am not well today . I tried to go through with it , I tried . But I could n't . " He said to me what he had said so many times , but this time without the smile , and his face was white . " You 're my friend , Lacy boy . " I heard the sound of a stick on the floor . Uncle Armistead , his hat on his head , stood in the door . " Hanh ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aye God , I told Susie I wa' n't going to sleep in no upstairs room . " He squinted his weak eyes at Mr. Broadacre . " Now ai n't that a cur'ous thing . I thought that janetleman was Lew . " He blinked his eyes at Brother George . " Who 's that , son ? " he said to me . " He 's Brother George , " I shouted . " You know , Uncle Armistead , Susie 's husband . " " Hanh ? " he said . " George you say . Hanh ? Had a Niggernamed George once . Best Nigger I ever had . Died of cholera . " He went to the sofa , and bowing to Mr. Broadacre , sat down by him . He sighed . " He means George Posey , I reckon . Old Rozier 's boy . Well , Rozier Posey ai n't been dead longer'n he needs to be . " He laughed a thin cackle. ' tI shouted in his ear : " George is in this room , Uncle Armistead . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glancing at George , turned his back and went to the other window by the sofa . Then I saw papa . He surveyed the room and I noticed that his eyes rested an instant longer upon Brother George than upon anybody else . He walked to the fireplace and placing his cane in the ingle , turned round . " Henry , " he said to Mr. Broadacre , " you 're feeling better but you 're feeling none too well . You and your lady are staying for supper . Now do n't discuss it . " He was about to sit down ; his hands were on the arms of his chair ; but he pushed himself up again . Without looking at Brother George , who was still at the window where the twilight was shutting out our world , papa went to the high mantel and striking a match in the back of the cold fireplace , lit a candle . He held the match burningwith an oily blue flame , then tossed it into the fire/place . I smelt the sulphur . He looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . Brother George . " Son , I am glad to see you , " he said . He extended his hand and I thought it would stay there , stretched out , forever , but at last George swiftly and awkwardly put out his hand , and the two men faced each other a long instant . The candlelight was at papa 's back but it shone full and fitfully upon Brother George 's face which was white and sullen . I could not see papa 's face . Brother George lowered his eyes , then raised them towards me in an unseeingstare . Papa withdrew his hand and returned to his chair , into which he dropped heavily , like a sack of bran , and sat with a meditative bow of the head . Cousin John still gazed into the rising night . Mr. Broadacre was cutting a quid from a long , dark plug . Uncle Armistead 's head was in his beard and his nose vibrated with sleep . " Lacy , " papa said , " you 're through school for the year , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He took his snuffbox out of his waistcoat pocket , and opening it ' on the palm of his hand lifted a pinch to his nose , and sneezed . Cousin John looked at him , smiled to himself , and shook his head . Papa sat up straight . " Henry  --  " but Mr. Broadacre was asleep , his mouth open and the quid a small knot in his cheek . Papa tapped the arm of his chair with his long , hairy forefinger . I started for the door . There was Uncle Armistead 's Negro . Seeing me he backed into the dark hall . He whispered , and I returned to the threshold . " Brother George , " I said in a loud voice beyond control , " Aunt Jane Anne wants to see you . She 's in ma 's room . "  --   |p110He  bolted from the window like a runner who has heard the starting shot , but-when he reached the door he turned to papa , his right hand lifted before him in an unfinishedgesture . Without a word he backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me as he rubbed his chin . " Son , " he said , " bring me your Ovid in the morning . " He motioned me to him with the long finger . I stood by the arm of his chair . " Good night , son , " he said and pulled me down and kissed my cheek . He squeezed my arm . " Good night . " " Good night , papa . " I walked carefully out of the room . In the front hall there was subdued , rapid conversation , and quick footsteps . Through the moving figures I saw Coriolanus standing in the open door , a lighted lantern in his hand , and beyond him the pinched face of Blind Joe , who held in his hand Brother George 's silver spurs . I stood by the newel-post and presently Aunt Jane Anne and Miss Milly George , followed by Jane with her perpetuallydowncast eyes , came from mother 's room into the hall . Aunt Jane Anne seemed so little to be in those enormous skirts . Her shawl was tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she might have been Little Red RidingFlood timidly hoping that she might soon encounter a wolf . Miss Milly George , the taller by two heads , looked round her suspiciously but suspicious of what I could not see . Jane stood behind her and I could not see her at all . " Janie , we better hurry up , it 's so far and all . George better hurry . " " Where 's George ? " said Aunt Jane Anne . " George ! " she called in her gentle voice . Brother George came out of the void of the front parlor and , back in the shadows , I saw Susan menaced by the dark , a specter in cloak and bonnet.  | " We 're ready , " George said to his mother . " Susan is goingtoo , " and the corners of his mouth drew up in a halfsmile . He was standing perfectly erect . His face hardened . " Damn you , Joe , where are you ? " Rabbit-eyed Joe came into the hall and as he fastened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me and embracing me , said : " Tell papa , I ca n't help it . I have to go . " She saw the other ladies going out to the gallery and she followed . I saw her reach out in a gesture towards Jane , but she withdrew her hand and rapidly put on her gloves . Cousin John passed me and stood with the ladies outside the door . He offered his elbow to Aunt Jane Anne . " Allowme , madam , " he said . They went down the steps . Brother Semmes appeared out of the dark yard and tried to give his arm to Miss Milly George . " Humph , " she said . " I never saw the time I needed a man . Come here to me , Jane . " But Jane did not move . Miss Milly George pinched the sides of her skirts and marched down the steps . Semmes held out his hand to Jane but she ignored it , or did not we it , and he reached for her hand and holding it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hand were stiff and she walked as if she were going to break in two . She had not looked at me at all . Coriolanus was holding the yellow light at the open door , and the Posey ladies disappeared into the carriage . I followed Brother George to the threshold . He stopped and put his hand upon my head . " You 're my friend , Lacy boy . Do n't get into any meanness . " He threw back his head and laughed , and then gave his arm to Susan ; together they went down the steps . Cousin John was looking through the pale light at Semmes and I followed his gaze . Semmes ' eyes were fixed upon Susan in terrible amazement and his mouth hung open as if he had stepped barefoot upon a stingaree . I knew then he had not seen her on the gallery . She spoke to him , looking away : " Good-by , Semmes , " and got into the carriage . George slammed the carriage door and held out his hand to Semmes who took it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 'll be looking for you , " he said . " I reckon you 'll be cutting up your cadavers again this time next week . We 'll be looking for you . " Cousin John turned his back upon him and mounted the gallery steps , standing by me , his arm round my shoulders . " It 's been a day , " he said . Together we watched Brother George vault into the saddleand saw the toss of the bay mare 's head as she cantered off towards the cedared lane that we could not see . The carriage followed beyond the ring of Coriolanus ' yellow light as we heard the darkness take all but the hooves and the creaking springs . The old Negro disappeared round the end of the house . I saw him no more that day . " It ai n't over yet , " said Cousin John . The bracket lamp from the hall lit the oily gray hair hanging in strings about his tall collar . " He 's a cur'ous fellow . Semmes thinks he understandshim but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied my face . " You better come in the house . " He went in and on down the hall where I heard him close the back parlor door . But Cousin John does n't know everything , I thought , seeing again Brother Semmes ' face by the coffin and Jane 's luster , the silk slipper on the floor and then , fearfully , Susan withdrawing her hand from Jane into the glove . What did she want me to tell papa ? What was there to tell ? That was the way those things stood with us in thep113April of 186o , at the death of my mother , and I ran down the steps and around the house in the dark , and sat down where Jane had sat , on the big root of the sugar tree.  |p117THE  next winter Cousin John Semmes went to Washingtonto live , and we stayed in his house in Alexandria , a tall three-storey red brick , on Fairfax Street near Duke in the same block with the Presbyterian Meeting House . From the top of the house where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on bright days far up the river into Washington , six miles as the crow flies : the unfinished dome of the Capitol , the truncated obelisk which later became the Washington monument , and off to the right a little , the flagpole in the White House yard from which I could see , if there was a strong landward breeze , the fluttering Americanflag . Whether my mother 's death had matured me , or whether the long year that had gone by since her death , bringing inc to the next twenty-third of May , had enlarged my observation , I do not know . But from that day , the twentythirdof May , 1861 , I count myself a man , from the time I was only sixteen . And from that twenty-third of May to the twilight of July twenty-first , just two of the eight hundred and forty , months of the Biblical span of life , I witnessed an accumulation of disasters that brought about in our lives changes that would otherwise have taken two generations . I mark the beginning of my maturity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will understand that neither of them properly speaking was an experience of my own , but rather something sheer , out of the world , easier to bring back than the miseries and ecstasies of my own life . To this day I can see without effort the dark mustache of dead Mr. Jackson lying in Colonel Ellsworth'sblood , the two bloods mingling there at the foot of the stairs ; Colonel Ellsworth the first and Mr. Jackson , papa 's friend , the second to fall , of the many thousands that were soon gone . That was the beginning . I knew I was a man when Brother George at dusk of July twenty-first opened the carpetbag and took out the black suit to change his clothes . Even now as I lie awake early in the morning I can bring back the sounds of that winter : old Lucy Lewis going out of the garden gate with a click , just before day , with her basket to meet the huckster who cried his winter vegetables into our sleep  --  cabbages and cauliflower , old potatoes , onions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxen to turn them up Duke Street . If it was cold I would pull the covers over my eyes and count from the last bump of the cart on the cobblestones to the first sound of Henry Jackson 's feet on the stairs . Henry tapped on the door with his knuckle and came in and set the coal scuttle on the hearth , and began laying the fire . I listened then for another sound  --  papa shaking down the ashes in his grate far downstairs . He would not let Henry or Coriolanus make his fire and I am not sure that he gave orders that mine be made ; Henry , in town , had little to do , but being a fine Negro  --  papa said of Coromantee stock , the best African tribe  --  he was scrupulous to the last degree and could not bear idleness . Henry got up from the grate , the 9scuttle full of ashes in his hand , and without looking towardsmy bed always said , " Major say git up . " And then he was gone . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : it was only Henry 's appeal to an authority that he was sure would sustain him . Then the rising-bell sounded and I heard Aunt Myra come out of the bedroom under my room and go down the stairs , two steps and a pause , two steps and a pause , for her rheumatism , until the parlor door clicked behind her . I leaped from the bed , drew on my Osnaburgs , dashed my face into the cold water , and was dressed with the speed of a soldier . Because the halls were empty I knew it was safe for me to slide down the banisters , and large as I was I always did it . Our habits are hard to remember . Perhaps it is only a special thing , a slight alteration of our daily routine on one morning of that winter that brings back the scene of our morning prayers . When I came into the parlor that morning  --  it was late in January  --  all the family were there , in their places : all , that is , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who never joined us but lay abed until nine and never showed herself until dinner-time , which in those days was at two o'clock . Papa stood with his back to the cold fireplace , in a long dressing gown and carpet slippers , holding the Prayer Book in his left hand , his long forefinger marking the place . But for the life of me I ca n't remember whether Coriolanus always stood where I saw him that morning , to one side of papa , like him facing the room , hut turned a little towards the servants , as if he were papa 's deacon appointed to represent the divine interests of his race . " There were Lucy Lewis , Henry Jackson , and the free Negress Lucinda , the cook , whom I did not like , but who was there because Juniper , our old cook at Pleasant Hill ,  |p120had  begged papa not to bring her to town , and of course papa , who never yielded a point of discipline , always gave in to human feeling , and he let her stay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in and joined us as we were kneeling , or rather just as papa lowered his bulk on one knee upon the ottoman placed there for him . Brother Charles closed the door softly and knelt just inside . I am sure that Aunt Myra saw him , but she went through her set speech anyhow : " Brother Lewis , my stiffness prevents the appropriate attitude of devotion , " she said sliding forward in her chair and bowing her head . But papa still looked at her expectantlyfor the rest of her speech , which we all knew t was coming . " And you must excuse our dear Lucy , she ca n't be with us this morning . " She had never been with us , but Aunt Myra made her persistent neglect of family prayers a daily exception and a daily reproach . From where I knelt on the far side of Aunt Myra I glanced at Brother Charles ' face : it did not change , and if there was no resentmentin it there was no humor either . Charles , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of our late bereavement . Sister Susan could not leave her husband and infant , and Brother Semmes had resumed his medical studies and only rode over from Washington every fortnight or so to see how papa was . But Lucy had come with bad grace . She had lived for two years amid the official society of the capital city , and I suppose it had turned her head . Lucy 's people were like ours in every respect , and I am sure I must have met some of them in my childhood , but before her connection with our family I saw no reason to observe them , and they made on me the anonymous impression that miscellaneousgrown persons leave upon the mind of a child . But she was distinctly , as the country phrase went , abovep121her raisin ' , and she looked upon us , upon papa particularly , as old-fashioned and provincial . Once papa asked her if she had seen the Lacys , distant kin of ours in Washington , and she replied that she had not  --  that " they are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocent way : " What is that ? Never heard of it . " It was Brother Charles of course who , by coming over to live with us , had made the sacrifice , but from Lucy we heard nothing of that . Charles had to ride horseback eight miles to General Scott 's office in Washington every morningwhere as a staff-officer he wrote letters and orders for " old Fuss and Feathers , " as the young men in the army called the old hero . But Charles once remarked , with his own kind of innocence , that he liked it , that in Alexandria he saw a great deal more of even Susan than he had when he and Lucy were in Washington just a couple of miles from Vista Avenue in Georgetown where the Poseys lived . Susan and Lucy moved in different sets , Lucy having decided that the fashionable official life of the city comportedill with the simpler ways of her own kin ; and she held a small " levee " one afternoon every week to which foreign attaches and army officers came , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man to be betterknown later , Henry Adams , a great snob even then , who got on Charles ' nerves by pretending friendship with Rooney Lee , the coloncl 's son , having been with him at Harvard , and yet ridiculing him for his lack of learning . I had always thought of papa as an educated man , but Lucy did n't , and this matter of education , for her , came down to knowing things very quickly and , I suppose , just idle curiosity . Even then she must have been thinking of Charles as a dull fellow with merely correct manners who constantly confused people and disconcerted her by askingacquaintances to " look in upon us this evening "  --  by which he meant of course Lucy 's afternoon tea ; and people from the North would turn up at nine o'clock when Lucy had other engagements . Although Lucy had set up as a minor hostess and con- - sidered her teas the scene of smart gatherings where bright worldly talk glittered over the cups , I wondered later what the poor girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were never there , not even Susan ; and I think Lucy and Susan met only once in Washington , at a wedding that had been for weeks the talk of the town and even of the surrounding towns like Alexandria which had sent their share of the wedding guests . The daughter of a rich wholesalegrocer , a Miss Barker , was being married on Decembertwentieth  --  the date became a landmark for another reason  --  and the reception was one of the few occasions on which the local society mingled with the official . The groom was a young naval officer and the bride came of a family originally of Fairfax but then of long residence in the capital . Her older sister had been a friend of Susan 's , and that is why , I suppose , Susan was at the wedding ; I do not know whether Brother George went , but I suppose he did , for Cousin John Semmes next day reported to papa a remark that George must have made at the wedding : " The damned old fool ought to reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Buchanan . It was after the ceremony , and the refreshments were being passed at the reception , when a group of young gentlemen headed by Mr. Lawrence Keitt of South Carolinaliterally burst into the front door . They were so headlong that it was said Mr. Keitt rushed into the front parlor unannounced , waving his hat , and subdued himself only when he saw in the back parlor the Presidential party , Mr. Buchanan and his niece Miss Harriet Lane ; and even then his excitement impelled him to march into " the pres/ence , " and , commanding the attention of the entire room , bowed and said in his best platform manner : " Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , I take great pleasure in announcingto you that the people of South Carolina have this day in convention assembled passed an ordinance of secession , severing the political ties that once existed betweenthat sovereign State and the Government of the United States . " Susan said that he was about to continue , but applause from the front parlor arrested him , and when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All eyes were on the President , who was breathing heavily , his face flushed and his hands shaking ; after the briefest adieus to his host and hostess he went to his carriage , and people feared that before he reached the White House he would succumb to a stroke . It was then that George had made his remark , and from that day on the atmosphere of Washington was never the same , and the lives of even quiet people like us , in Alexandria , became expectant , we knew not of what . I only remember , of those early days of the struggle , that papa felt South Carolina ought to be suppressed but was astonishedwhen Cousin John told him what George Posey had said . As it carne out later and as I shall explain in the proper place , papa wished to see the cotton people brought to their senses , but he could not at that time make up his mind to let any of the known agencies of suppression , like the Executive department of the government , do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month in which events came headlong one after another , I began to observe my father more closely than ever , but to no conclusion : what I say here about the inward strain that I soon detectedin his kindly old eyes is partly after-knowledge . The first time he gave warning of some unusual anxiety was onp124that perfectly commonplace morning during family prayers . I do not mean to say that he had not , in the month since the secession of South Carolina , spent most of his time at the newspapers , or in conversation with the citi-zensof Alexandria , to say nothing of his long talks with Cousin John Semmes when Cousin John came over on a Sunday . I never heard any of these talks and I only remember a remark Cousin John made to me one day after dinner : " Your pa is still living before he was born  --  in 1789 . He thinks the government is a group of high-minded gentlemen who are trying to yield everything to one another . Damn it , Lacy , it 's just men like your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the surest proof of t her greatness , that are going to ruin us . They ca n't understand that reason and moderation have n't anything to do with the crisis . They wo n't let themselves see what 's going on . Aye God , they 'll see when Federal troops march through the State on the way to South Carolina ! " But I did n't know what he was talking about , and remembered that he and papa had never agreed in politics . I let it go at that . That morning in the front parlor it was so cold that I had to blow my fingers to keep them warm : Charles ' horse , tied outside to the horseblock , stamped on the cobblestones . But papa pushed his spectacles up on the bridge of his nose and said , " We will repeat the Lord 's Prayer . " And I did n't fix my mind upon it , but let it wander , so that when it was over and papa had begun to read , not from the Psalter for that day but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transition , for I could have said it by heart too . Suddenly I knew something was wrong , for Aunt Myra raised her head and opened her eyes , looking straight at papa , then lowered her glance . Forp125when papa had read , " We thy needy creatures , render thee our humble praises for thy preservation of us from the beginning of our lives to this day , " he should have continued , " Having delivered us from the dangers of the watchful Providence we owe it , that no disturbance hath come nigh our dwelling ; but that we are brought to safety to the beginning of this day . " But he read the alternativeversion : " That notwithstanding our dangers we are brought in safety , " and so on . It was the version providedin the margin , in fine type , for the threat of calamity to the family , and even Charles as he rose to his feet and drew on his gloves looked alarmed , standing there by the door so long that papa disappeared into the back parlor before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say the day before that on the morrowSenator Davis by announcement would address the Senate in farewell , and I knew he felt that the last hope of public reconciliation was gone . But was that the real trouble ? Was there something else ? I can not to this day decidejust how papa looked at it : whether in his mind the domestic trials , growing out of my mother 's death , were one thing , and the public crisis another . Nor can I decide in my own mind whether it was possible to distinguish the two  --  they worked together for a single evil , and I think the evil was the more overwhelming among us because of the way men had of seeing themselves at that tine : as in all highly developed societies the line marking off the domestic from the public life was indistinct . Our domestic manners and satisfactions were as impersonal as the United States Navy , and the belief widely held today , that men may live apart from the political order , that indeed the only humane and honorable satisfactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have astonished most men of that time as a remote fantasy , impossible of realization . Notwithstanding our dangers , papa began that 19th day of January , 1861 , as if it were like all days . For after the family had scattered  --  Aunt Myra to the kitchen with her keys to dispense the food for the day , Brother Charles to his duty , and the servants to the rear of the house  --  I went into the back parlor for the private ceremony that papa had established between us when I had entered the Academy the autumn before . He sat to the left of the fireplacein his favorite chair , the old Windsor that he had brought in from Pleasant Hill , the fire-screen shielding his face from the blaze , and his snuffbox in his hand for 1 his first morning sneeze . As I came in he laid the box on the small table by his chair , rose to his feet , and as I stood before him he leaned over and kissed me on the forehead . Then he shook hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , in your labors of this day . " " God bless you , papa , " I said . And I went quickly out of the room as papa resumed his seat and Coriolanus busied himself with a feather-duster about the fireplace . On Saturdays I saw the two old gentlemen together in the morning , as they must have been every morning in the week . Papa would seat himself with his paper or a book , or would go over to the secretary on the other side of the fire to write his letters while Coriolanus dusted the room , set the chairs in order , and , if papa was writing , raised the Venetian blinds a little to let more light in . When this work was finished  --  it took only a few minutes  --  papa would glance up from his reading over the rims of his steel spectacles , and say , " Well , Coriolanus , your labors must have fatigued you . You 'd better rest a little . " Coriolanus sat down in a small straight chair near thep127hearth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major " not punctiliously invited him every morning . He let his head fall on his chest , and dozed with the feather-duster in his hand , as papa continued reading . In this way the two old friends enjoyed each other 's company . But this winter papa had visitors , especially after the 19th of January when not only had Mr. Davis resigned from the Senate and gone back to Mississippi , but the State of Georgia had seceded , making the states out of the Union a solid block from the Atlantic to the Mississippi River . One Sunday afternoon early in February a group of gentlemen drove down Fairfax Street in an open carriage , and I was mildly astonished , looking out of my high window , to see them draw up at our door . The first man to alight even from that distance I recognized as Mr. John Minor Botts , a Virginia politician , portly and consequential , whose countenance nowise belied his reputation for partisanship and vituperation : his heavy features were fixed in perpetual anger . I did not know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit portended , but I knew it was politics of some kind ; so I ran downstairs in time to see papa greet them and usher them into the back parlor . I stood irresolute in the door and papa , seeing me , said , " Come in , son , " and then to the visitors , " This is my son Lacy , gentlemen . " I clicked my heels and bowed and walked quickly to the back of the room and stood by a window with my eyes fixed upon the churchyard 's familiar scene . They were all politicians , and I wondered if Cousin John , if he had n't been kin , would have seemed like them . Two of the men I looked at narrowly , although I was never to see them again . They both had black beards covering their entire faces , clipped close and unfamiliarly neat . These men were from the North . They spoke briskly , without warmth , and yet there was something personal in - their demeanors , and I noticed that when either of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face  --  I thought in order to catch every word ; for I could understand only about half of what they said . But who could remember a conversation like that , after so many years ? I recall chiefly the impatient emphasis of Mr. Botts , who broke in to correct his Northern allies . " No , no ! We are Union men , but you must remember that our Union sentiment is different from yours ; it must be treated gently . I believe , gentlemen , whatever the State may do eventually , we can keep northern Virginia for the Union , ' hut we must be careful ! " On the way out , the taller of the two Northerners paused at the door and as he shook hands with papa he said , " Major , I am delighted to find so many of our people down here . " I ca n't remember if papa said anything , but I wish he had ; it would have given me some idea of the future , of what he intended to do . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to attend Secession meetingsin Alexandria in which Cousin John was a leader . I do n't know whether papa caught the slight emphasis that the Northern gentleman put on our : as I thought about it I began to hear a certain unction in the echo of that one syllable , " our people , " but if papa felt anything of the kind he took it innocently , as if it meant only people of the same politics . I am sure that the Northerner meant something else , some sympathy beyond political belief  --  for such , I learned later , was the mysterious power of the idea of Union among people in the North . I suppose the talk had been about the Peace Conventionthat a few days before ex-President Tyler had called in Washington to meet on the very day the **25;5222;TOOLONG had been organized in Montgomery , Alabama . Montgomery was only a name and the Confederate Government did not , for me , exist . At that time I had not been in Richmond and seen Mr. Jefferson 's replica of the Maison Carree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the collection of buildings that straggled from the Capitol to the White House , some classical , others paste-board Gothic  --  for that was the flimsy look they had at a distance . But it was a " government , " and it was in the South , and it had been set up by Virginians : it was my distinct impression until manhood and educationeffaced it , that God was a Virginian who had created the world in his own image . It followed that the Governmentwas ours too . That was the illusion of a boy , but men felt it too , with what dire consequences to their equanimity the next few months were to show : it made hard the choice of allegiance among people on both sides of the Potomac . And as for Montgomery , it was far away , more than a thousand miles , and while it was in the South , it was not Virginia , and we habitually spoke of all that country beyond the mountains , from Minnesota to the Gulf , as the " West . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment of our old neighborhood towards Mr. Tyler 's Convention . Papa had assured them of the support of a typical community of that locality . The Convention in fact was a gesture quite after his own heart : he saw no reason why intelligent men should not meet I rom all parts of " our country " and compose their differences . So the irrepressible conflict gathered in fury into April : Ole Peace Convention had failed ; Abraham Lincoln had been inaugurated but had done nothing ; the People of Virginia were in constant Convention in Richmond , be/hind closed doors , but the Union men still had the upper hand ; and there were many persons like papa who believed that the Cotton States would be allowed to make good their separation , and relieve the " border " of the responsibility of making a decision . Only Cousin John Semmes kept saying that , by God , it was nonsense . And then one day that will never fade from my memory we heard boys shoutingin the street , " Extra ! Extra ! Fort Sumter bombarded ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a paper , and just as I was turning back into the house I saw up Fairfax Street a company of soldiers : they were marching up King , and as I stood there the file-closers disappeared from sight . They were the Alexandria Rifles , an old military company ' that papa had fought with in 1812 . But it was only their drill day ; they were going out to a field west of town . I was about to close the front door when I heard a voice : " Lacy , Lacy ! Here we are ! " It was the voice of Brother Semmes . A carriage had pulled up in front of the house . In it were Semmes and Susan , and the colored nurse with little Jane . I went back to the sidewalk to be embraced . Susan patted my cheek , and I touched little Jane 's hand . " Well , " said Semmes , looking at the copy of the Gazette in my hand . " I reckon you 've heard the news . " He looked at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Before I could say anything Brother George had come up on the bay mare , and had leaped from the saddle . He came directly to me and put his hand on my head . He never shook hands with me . He rumpled my hair . " You 're my friend , Lacy boy ! " He smiled and I smiled back at him as Semmes and Susan led the way into the house.  |p131Memory  is all chance , and I have learned that you remember things not because they are important ; you remember the important things because they help you to fix in mind the trifles of your early life , or the trifles simply drag along with them through many years the incidents that have altered your fortunes . I suppose it was important for me to know some time that winter that Brother George controlled our family property , and had controlled it for nearly a year . When I knew this clearly I do not know , and can not recover the gradual awareness of the fact . Doubtless it began the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about " papa merely thinking those Negroes were free "  --  meaning Jack Lewis and his family , whom papa had certainly sent to Alexandria with manumission papers that were to be executed by Brother George . I suppose I had thought of the old horse papa had given Jack Lewis as getting his freedom at the same time . But Brother George had sold the whole family to a dealer from Georgia  --  that I learned that winter from Charles , who dropped it casually , like a secret too old to be any longer kept hidden : had sold them , doubtless the horse too , and applied the couple of thousand dollars to papa 's debt at a bank in Alexandria . I could not tell whether papa knew it , but everybody else in the family knew , and took sides  --  Cousin John Semmes against George , saying it was " a piece of damned impertinence for George Posey to wind Lew 's business for him " ; Brother Semmes for George , for reasons that I can not explain but in the course of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him too , after some persuasion on the part of his wife . Lucy said that it was only right for George to protect the heirs by keeping the estate solvent , or words to that effect ; if Lucy was ignorant of business she had a strong instinct about it . I took no sides ; I learned about it so gradually , and I was so young , that when I knew everythingit was too late to judge it , and there was too much to  --  - be said on both sides . Semmes always justified George by saying that if papa realized that the Negroes were uselessly eating away his substance , it was better to sell a few than to drift into bankruptcy , which would compel him to sell them all under the hammer . And who can say that he was not right ? I have never been able to say to myself that George Posey , that remarkable fellow , was not right about everything , even to the point of rectitude . I never knew him to do a selfish thing ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother 's grave , that he could not do . And who , after that moment , could blame him for that , without at the same time acknowledging the disinterested concern for the welfare of us all ? He cared nothing for money : if he did , why did he give it away or spend it so lavishly ? He thought nothing of spending a hundred dollars to charter a little steamboat to take a large party for an outingat Arlington spring . People had gone there for years at Mr. Custis ' invitation ; now that he was dead Colonel Lee extended the same hospitality , only he could not send the old Negro fiddler to entertain the company , for the fiddler , like his master , was dead too . Some time in the summer of 1860 it had been arranged : papa was nearly sixty-five years old , and upon representationsfrom Brother Charles , as the eldest son , some sort of deed of trust was given to George Posey for all the landed property , including , besides Pleasant Hill , some two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the western counties ; this put great responsibility upon George , but it did not tax his generosity . He immediately paid to Charles and Semmes the money equivalent to their shares , about fifteen thousand dollars apiece , and theyp133signed over to him their interests in the estate . George paid them more than the market value of the land , which was getting lower rather than higher in our county every year . Would he ever get his money back ? Cousin John Semmes seemed never to consider this , and as I see it now he failed to consider it for the same reason that George was willing to risk a loss . They were both disinterested and set in t heir ideas , and the ideas clashed . Cousin John resented the plan because it meant the breaking up of the Buchan estate ; but that meant nothing to George Posey . I think he was convinced that it would break up sooner or later . 1 is would never carry on the life at Pleasant Hill ; Lucy would never permit Charles to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy . Was he not acting in our interest ? Was he not protecting us from the consequences of our situation , consequences that seemed inevitable to him ? And papa had virtually yielded to Brother George the tanning operations : Mr. Higgins was now under the supervisionof a " man of business , " and that man was George . 1 t was in further protection of the heirs , of course , that the cultivation of the land was put upon a money basis , for which Mr. Higgins was accountable in terms of strict economy . All this must be reckoned against prejudice ; reckoned , that is , against the attitude of Cousin John Semmes . There were ways in which Cousin John was " smarter " than George , he knew more about everything ; he was better educated ; he was in fact , like my grandfather , an " elegantgentleman " ; yet he saw little in George Posey but impertinencebecause he allowed himself to see not what George was doing but only the way he did it . I had frequentlyheard Cousin John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from raising more Negroes to be sold into the canebrakes of the Mississippi . If papa had faced that , to him , dreadful phase of his position , I never knew it ; but George Posey had faced it for him . To him papa 's a refusal to buy or sell a Negro was only a kind of fastidious self-indulgence at the expense of his posterity , who would have to sell the Negroes sooner or later , or manumit them at the cost of actually giving money away . I suppose George , in what was considered his high-handed fashion , took the first step against this family bankruptcy when he sold Jack Lewis and his family into Georgia : to have freed them , in deference to papa 's wish , would have been , to George , to permit papa to rob his children in order to do what he considered humanly right . Papa could not use the Negroes ; therefore they must be freed . But was not George Posey right about this ? And was not papa also , in his own way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the estate . Susan and I would get our portions after papa 's death . George had in effect lent the estate thirty thousand dollarsto pay off Charles and Semmes ; and if the final evaluationshould be more than sixty thousand , they would get more . They would surely get it , since the estimate of sixty thousand did not include Negroes , stock , implements , to say nothing of the Pleasant Hill house and its appointments , which Brother George somewhat characteristically transposed into cash figures . It was that sort of thing of course that annoyed Cousin John and irritated papa , who could not bring himself to think of the house that Dr. Buchan had built in 1791 , " for the enjoyment of the heirs forever , " not , mind you , for their profit , had any money value at all . If he admitted its money value he also admitted that it might some day be sold  --  which was unthinkable . In giving this account of our property I am straddling two ages . Nobody in my youth discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was a little different , I believe , from the ordinary good breeding that demands reticence about the cost of things . That too was never done ; but the point of the other " rule " was that it had grown out of long habit , out of a way of seeing men in society ; it was less a rule than an actual habit of the mind . It was significant that we always spoke of the Carters of Ravensworth , the Carys of Vaucluse , the Buchans of Pleasant Hill . The individual quality of a man was bound up with his kin and the " places " where they lived ; think-ing of a man we could easily bring before the mind 's eye all those subtly interwoven features of his position . " Class " consisted solely in a certain code of behavior . Even years later I am always a little amazed to hear a man described as the coal man or the steel man or the plate-glass man , descriptions of people after the way they make their money , not after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once overheard some of the old ladies of our neighborhood , Mrs. Langton and I think old Mrs. Gunnell , trying to " place " him , and because he lived across t he Potomac they found it a little hard : Gibson and Posey were good names , but which Gibsons and which Poseys ? ' I hen somebody said that George sold fish , but of course they could have said that he sold tobacco , lumber , and leather , as well as everything raised on the Posey land in Charles and Anne Arundel . I remember old Mrs. Gunnell trying to catch the talk in her ear-trumpet , and not quite getting it . " He does something about fish ? " she asked . Cousin John Semmes always said that George would sell anything for the pleasure of buying something else ; he had to keep moving . Even if somebody had called George the fish man he would n't have cared . He would have laughed . I le had only put the Gibson Negroes in St. Mary 's to fishingcommercially the waters that lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to market a great many oysters too . When we got into the hall I lagged behind , and stood irresolute by the stairs until George had followed Susan and Semmes into the back-parlor and closed the door . The only sounds I could hear were the shouts of the newsboy , now far down the street , and , from the back-parlor , papa 's voice rising and falling in an unnatural sing-song that meant he was playing with little Jane . My niece , I said ; and for the first time I took it in , with the feeling that it made me a man . But I always stood away from her and I could never remember how she looked . I began counting over the people who had come  --  George , Susan , and Semmes , the baby and the colored nurse , Ricky something they called her ; and then I added big Jane whom I had not seen since Christmas . I had seen her a few times since the funeral , but never alone ; I wondered if knowing that Susan was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , at night , I was secretly ashamed , or whether Susan understood what I felt and was exercising that peculiarcynicism , that vigilance and lucidity that seem to exist in women in proportion to their innocence . Perhapsit was only my size : at sixteen I had shot up to-five feet ten and was strong as a mule colt . I wanted to be alone and I had put one foot on the stairs when I heard a door close , and looking up I saw Aunt Myra in the upper hall . Presently Lucy joined her , and I heard low voices . " No , " said Lucy , " I saw them get out of the carriage . Charles did n't come . " Aunt Myra said nothing , but presently she started down the stairs in the slow one-two rhythm of her rheumatism ,  |p137and  Lucy followed her . At the foot of the stairs Aunt Myra turned to Lucy and said , " Lucy , listen to me . ' I here 's going to be a time when Charlie will make a habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault . You know what is happening . You know what he will do . " I said , " What will Brother Charles do , Aunt Myra ? " She looked at me sharply . " Lacy , thank God for your age . I wish you were even younger . " She took Lucy by the arm and led her down the hall into the back-parlor . I was about to follow , but the knocker sounded , and I went to the door ; as I grasped the knob I heard men 's voices and when I opened the door the two men , glancing at me , continued what they were saying while I stood waiting for them to enter . Cousin John gave me his hand . " 1 howdy , son , " he said . Major Corse  --  he was now a majorsmiled at me and put his hand on my shoulder , but said nothing . " Tell your pa we 're here , " said Cousin John . As I went down the hall Coriolanus appeared and said to the gentlemen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the major ? " He went to the back-parlor door . The nurse Ricky came out with little Jane in her arms . Coriolanusstood at the threshold and said : " Marster , Marse John and Major Corse to see you , sir . " They went in and I slid in behind them . While the gentlemen were bowing to the ladies I went to a window , and got in between the window and the curtains . Children were playing among the graves . Then I heard papa speak : I looked over my shoulder to see him shake hands with Major Corse . " Well , well , major , " papa said , " you no sooner get Irronioted than you stop wearing your uniform . Is n't this ! mister day ? " Cousin John 's voice was at once matter-of-fact and ominous . " He do n't know what uniform to get . " Thenp138he seemed to be lecturing us . " If a major 's uniform were the same everywhere , he could just get a major 's uniform . Could n't you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We do n't live under the Parliament of Man , the Federationof the World . ' Men do n't fight yet with olive branches . " " Why , major , " said Lucy , " you looked so handsome in your captain 's uniform . I told Charles that you looked like an army officer . " " Just the militia , ma'am . " He bowed slightly and sat down in a small straight chair . He opened his mouth to speak , then glanced uneasily around the room . He was a young man , not more than forty , with a tall narrow head , clear large eyes of neutral color , strong chin and small determined mouth . I traced his glance to George Posey who was sitting on a low chair behind Susan in the far corner of the room . Susan caught the glance . " Mr. Corse , " Susan said , " we are all friends here . " Papa leaned forward and tapped his knee with his forefinger . " I do n't understand you , daughter . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Major Corse . " What does this mean ? What is this talk about uniforms ? I presume you will wear the uniform of the Alexandria Rifles ? I wore it once , sir , " he said gently . Semmes rose , but a dead silence fell and he was caught there ; as he sat down again he found my eye , and raised his brow inquiringly . Good God , I had left it on the newel post in the hall ! How could I get through all those people to the door at the other end of the room ? " We heard the cry of the newsboy . " It was Aunt Myra . " We know what it is . " She looked at Lucy . Semmes said in a low voice , " Lacy , go get the paper . " I walked carefullydown the long room , feeling conspicuous in the silence that suddenly descended again . I left the doorp139open after me , and the silence accompanied me all the %%ay to the front hall and back again until I confronted Semmes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to papa without a word . Papa was adjusting his spectacles with deliberation as I scurried back to my station at the window ; I turned and looked at the room . There was a solemnity of expressionand a strained ease of posture everywhere . Lucy looked as if she were about to be reprimanded for something ; Semmes was rubbing the side of his nose ; Susan had moved forward to the edge of her chair . George Posey was letting his watch dangle on its chain , glancing from it to papa , who I thought would never put the paper down . George looked at me and smiled with his eyes , then suddenly returned the watch to his pocket . I was afraid somebody would speak , wishing at the same time that somebody would , somebody else than papa , whose eyes moved slowly down the page . The dying coals in the grate settled with a thud . Everybody looked at the grate . Papa held the paper vaguely extended ; Cousin John took it and laid it on the secretary behind papa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the time has come that I have been telling you about these past six months . " So long ago that I had forgotten when , I had heard Cousin John call papa " Brother Lewis . " Papa fixed him a moment over the rims of his spectacles , and I suppose that reminded him to take them off , which he did with the usual deliberation , as if he were at Pleasant Hill and had been studying the prices of wheat and corn . But now he looked around the room at everybody in turn , appearing to take in the tension that held us as an astonishingmystery . He raised his brows and cleared his throat . " Brother John , " he said with a twinkle , " you had never told me about this . You had never said that Jeff Davis would order the reduction of a Federal fort . Myra , has John in your recollection ever said anything of the kind ? " Everybody in the room moved a little . George smiled again at me , and then at Semmes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of disappointment , as if papa had not received the news as he somehow ought to have received it . Major Corse and Cousin John were solemn ; but Lucy , doubtless thinking it was expected of her , laughed at papa 's joke , but nobody else did , least of all Aunt Myra who looked a little vexed . " Now Brother Lewis , you know quite well what 1Mr . Semmes meant . Do n't you realize that it 's war ? Do n't you know that Semmes will be in it ? " But she actually looked at me . Papa saw the look ; for the first time his face clouded . " War ? " he said . " How can there be a war ? Why , the Federal government will reinforce the troops at Fort Sumter . Ai n't any question about that . When the Federal authority is supreme in South Carolina the other Cotton States will come back one by one . " The flush on his cheeks mounted to his eyes and forehead . He drew his kerchief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearing his throat at the same time . Cousin John addressed Major Corse . " Corse , will the Alexandria Rifles offer their bayonets to the Federal gov-ernment ? " " No , sir , " said Major Corse . " Why not ? " " Because we feel that they might be used against our own people . " Papa looked politely at Major Corse , almost indulgently , and said , " Montgomery , we have nothing to dowith this South Carolina trouble . It do n't affect us at all . " I do n't know what was in my mind , or why I thought  |p141anything  , but I ran into the room a few steps , and cried , " Oh , papa , but it does  --  it does affect us . " He smiled at me and made a slight gesture with his kerchief , and I felt abashed ; but Cousin John stepped forward and touched my arm . " Lew , this boy is right . And I advise you to get out of this town as soon as you can . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far from South Carolina , as you 'll see . " Papa did n't look up ; he seemed vastly preoccupied with his own thoughts as , with his snuffbox before him , he kept opening and closing it absently , until I was sure that he was thinking of something very far from the scene , perhapsPleasant Hill where spring plowing was already far advanced . He surprised us ; he rose to his feet and ignoring Cousin John he addressed George , the first time he had addressed him directly since that evening in the back-parlor at home after the funeral when George had stood by the window and Mr. Broadacre had dozed on the sofa . He always answered George 's questions but he never asked him one . " George , " he said , " what have you to say about this ? I suppose you are still a good Union man ? " George got up and pushing his chair against the wall bowed slightly to papa , then began walking up and down across the far end of the room . Once he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are we good Union men ? " He shifted his eyes toward papa and seemed about to speak , but he only gazed , and the perpetual smile was a little softened by the serious concentration of his chin and brow . Papa was waiting for him to speak ; he suddenly sat down . " Major , " said George , " there 's no discourtesy in my failure to reply . I am thinking . " Cousin John came from behind papa and walked rap- idly across the room , his touseled hair framing an angry expression . Major Corse rose . When Cousin John reached the door he turned and surveyed the room . " Well , we better leave George Posey to his thoughts . And mark ye , Lewis Buchan , your son-in-law is too damned rich for his sense of responsibility . I know you ca n't be bought , " he said to George ; " I know you 're as honorable as the next one . I do n't know what side you 'll take , you wo n't take the side that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can buy . You think you can buy anything . Come on , Corse , I have an engagement at the Marshall House . " He backed out of the room . Major Corse rose and bowed to the assemblage . " Good evening , ladies and gentlemen . " His hand on the door knob , he paused . " Major Buchan , you 've known me from my boyhood . I am serious , sir ; we are all serious . Try to think well of us . " He inclined his head and disappeared into the hall ; the door closed after him . I looked at George : he was staring at the closed door , standing perfectly erect , his hands thrust into his pockets , all that remained of his smile lingering in the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes . I asked myself : Is he angry ? And I decided that he was not angry , that he was not insulted , but genuinely perplexed . His perplexity had caught him between steps as he was pacing back and forth , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spring . I looked at Susan : the blood had left her face , as I had seen it do when she spoke to Jim Mason about John Langton'srascality after the tournament . She rose and took a few steps towards the fireplace , turned round and faced her husband , then looked at papa . " Mr. Posey has borne a good deal from his wife 's family . Perhaps the time has come when he will not bear itp143any longer . " Her pale face was flushed . She turned away from papa and walked slowly out of the room . George suddenly relaxed and leaning forward a little put his hands upon the back of his chair . The perplexity had turned into amazement . He opened his mouth , but no words came , and it remained open . The dangerous ambiguityof Susan 's defense of her husband had driven into retreat everybody in the room . What lay behind that speech ?  --  what had Susan and George been saying to each other when they were alone ? I decided : nothing  --  they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his relation to her family , it would have established it as a privacy between them , and she could not have attackedhim so fiercely in the presence of others , least of all her family . I was not sure she was conscious of the full import of her words . As I heard the words again in the mind 's ear , I was convinced that she intended no ambiguity whatever : she started to speak , and in simple good faith meant to rebuke her family for their treatment of a son-in-law who in his fashion had been their prop and stay ; then as the words came forth they dragged with them , from some hidden depth , a judgment of George of which she herself until that moment had not been quite aware . Aunt Myra was looking at the floor ; Lucy , who had not felt the danger , caught the silence by contagion , and looked vaguely frightened ; Semmes , who had got it all , looked anxiously at papa , from whom I suppose he expectedrelief . George by this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to bear upon him like a demand : without moving his head he cast his eyes upon papa 's face , which now held a flushed reaction from his awareness of what Susan had meant . Papa was staring at the door , but after a few moments , without change of posture , he calmly moved his eyes to George who still leaned against the chair . " My son , " he said in a tone so low I could barely hear the words , " we are devoted to you . I am still the head of the Buchan family . Young as you are , I presume you are the head of your family . We understand each other . " George moved to the center of the room , and he was , as if by virtue of motion , the old George again : he was self-possessed , he gave me the distinct impression that he had recovered his solitude , that quality that he carried always with him as a weapon equally of attack and defense . My mind went back into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between papa and George , when George had played the old gentleman on a taut line . Now his head was thrown back and his gaze fixed papa steadily . " Major , " then he paused . " Major , I am gratified that we understand each other . Frankly , sir , I do not understand the present necessity of this conversation . " The late afternoon light had begun to fail . When I looked at papa again his face was gray . Then , unobtrusivelyas a shadow , a man came through the door , but after a few steps he paused , taking in the scene ; I doubt if either papa or George would have noticed him . As I recognizedmy brother Charles I heard , about ten seconds delayed , his knock at the door , which I was certain no one else had heard , so compelling was the tension of the conflictbefore us . I was a little disappointed ; Charles ' presencewould break up the tension , whose issue might have illuminated for me a great many mysteries , the meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everythingthat George had done about us . " My son , " said papa to George , " there is this necessity , that families must face the times together . The youngp145men of my family will consult me in their politics . You will decide whether you can act as a member of my family . That , " he added dryly , " is all I meant by our under-standing . " George slumped a little , his chin dropped to his chest , his feet shuffled ; I thought he was at last embarrassed , but his eyes blazed in the fading light , and when . he turned away he would have left the room if he had not confronted Charles , who had advanced a little further from the door and was holding Lucy 's hand . As for me , I lost some of my disappointment of a moment before , for indeed I had seen a small mystery , but whether I understood it then , or a little later , or only years later , I do not know . Why was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was a mystery that I could not solve . I suppose he had too much imagination and he could not confine the things that people said to what lay right before him , under his nose ; papa 's rebuke had obviously been aimed at a particular difficulty , it was only a very strong warning that he would tell his sons , without the interference of George , what course to take in the excitement of public affairs . " It is too late to consult anybody , even you , papa . " It was Charles . He looked at George . " How d'ye do , George , " he said . " Excuse me , papa . " He advanced and shook hands with papa . He looked at Semmes . " If I had n't gone away when I did I would be spending the night in the old Capitol Prison . " " Oh , Charles ! " Lucy cried . " Why , son , " said papa , " I do n't understand you . " " My dear , " Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The men had better talk this thing over . " Lucy got up , and Aunt Myra followed her without ap146word . Charles watched them soberly as they disappeared and closed the door . " George , " he said , " Captain Schaeffer is in prison . MajorStone arrested him at noon , under orders from GeneralScott . " " Who is Captain Schaeffer ? " papa asked . George looked at papa , then at Charles , who hesitated an instant and spoke in a casual tone . " Captain Schaeffer is the commander of the National Rifles , the company in Georgetown that George belongs to . George , you 've wasted your money . Stone hunted down and disarmed half of the company , and seized the reserve arms , which are at this moment in the government arsenal . " Papa 's face showed extreme perplexity as he rose and took one step forward . The young men , George no less than the others , gazed at him respectfully until , at a loss what to do on his feet , he sat down again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What has George to do with that ? " he asked . " Major , " said George , " my grandfather Gibson organizedthe National Rifles when Washington was a village . " Papa still gazed at him inquiringly . Semmes said , " George contributed a good deal to refittingthe company last winter . " He took a long black cigar from his waistcoat pocket , bit off the end , then removedit and gestured in the direction of papa , all the while looking at George , who instantly nodded his head . Semmes continued : " Papa , the Union men resigned from the Rifles a month ago , not more'n ten or a dozen . " I suppose , son , that you resigned too ? " " Papa , I did not . " He turned away and putting his arm against the mantel leaned his head against it . George backed off a few feet and sat down . Charles sat on the hairp147sofa where Lucy and Aunt Myra had been sitting . In these seconds of time papa had taken out his kerchief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aimlessly spread it out across his knees , but soon gathered it up and stuffed it back into his sleeve and with the same motion began to tap his knee with his forefinger . " Gentlemen , " he said , " perhaps one of you will poke the fire . " Semmes turned , startled , but bent over swiftly and brought the dying coals to a feeble blaze . Everybody in the room watched him with concentration . He straightened up but kept looking at the fire with exaggerated zeal until he could no longer pretend that it needed him . He seemed to struggle with himself but quickly his eyelids drooped and he stiffened , then moved quietly towards papa , leaning over him . " Papa , I am very sorry . " Papa 's finger came to an abrupt stop in mid-air , his hand sank listlessly upon his knee . The firelight threw into relief the long nose and the wide mouth , which was set as if in pain ; but as he glanced from one young man to another his eyes were bright . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazed at the fire . I le had surely heard Semmes , but he gave no sign of it . Semmes backed away and stood at the far end of the mantel . Papa cast an inquiring glance at Charles . " Well , sir , " said Charles , " you see I had been drilling the company at night , ever since Christmas , two or three nights a week . " He rose and paced back and forth , and turned again to papa . " It was perfectly regular . " Papa nodded and he continued . " I did n't know it but since Mr. Lincoln 's inauguration we 've been under observation . " He paused again as if the recital were about top148reach its painful stage . And I noticed that he had said " we " meaning himself and the National Rifles , and not the United States Army , of which he was an officer . " When I returned to General Scott 's office after dinner today the orderly called me aside and said that I was about to be arrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said General Scott was in a rage , the news of Sumter had just come over the wires , he was particularlysuspicious of Virginians , being one himself . " And Charles smiled , I think the second time I had seen him smile in my life . But no one in the room smiled back at him . He immediatelysobered , and composing his features tried to seem casual , but he only succeeded in being extremely formal . " Considerations of honor will compel me to resign my commission tomorrow , and I think I had better do it by letter . " He looked at George as if he expected him to say something , and George seemed about to speak , but papa rose and glancing over his shoulder at me , said : " Son , hand me my shawl , please . " The shawl was hanging on a hook between the near end of the mantel and the window , by papa 's secretary . I lifted it from the hook and handed it to him . He drew it carefully round his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halls at this season . " When he came to the door he turned , his hand on the knob , to face the young men . George had risen ; he bowed his head ; his lips moved , then he suddenly compressed them into silence . There was in his face at that moment a shadow , or a line , or perhaps it was only a trick of the falling dusk , that I thought was agony , or at least painful indecision . " Father Buchan , " he said , and the form of addressp149startled me . " We ca n't do anything else now . I am not choosing sides , I am chosen by circumstances . I want you to know , sir , that I do prefer the Union . " He lowered his voice . " And that I do sympathize with your position . " By the time I looked at papa again he was standing straight as a bell pole . The shawl gradually slid off his shoulder to the floor as he threw his head back : the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dilated in anger . With difficulty he held his arms at his sides . He gave George a long , fixed stare . " I thank you , sir , " he said . His mouth widened with a fierce smile , but he was no longer looking at George . " Semmes , I hope that I have your sympathy too . " He backed out of the door , closed it with a firm , gentle bang ; and I heard his rapid footsteps ascending the stairs . The shawl lay in a heap where it had fallen . Charles got up stiffly and recovered it , hanging it carefully over the back of a chair . Semmes was chafing his hands in agitation . " George , " he said , " perhaps we had better reconsider our position . We ca n't  --  " " Ca n't what , Semmes ? " The tone was remote , and in the last minute he had become again the George that I knew : his eyes were cold and smiling . Charles said : " George , maybe Semmes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Papa do n't know that Mr. Lincoln will ask Virginia for troops to send to Charleston . Lincoln and Seward have planned this all along , waiting for an overt act by Mr. Davis . " George seemed not to hear . He moved towards the door , then ignoring Charles , he addressed Semmes . " Semmes , are we together in this thing or not ? That'sthe only thing you 've got to decide . Are we together ? " Semmes had been looking at him but now his face fell ,  | and he leaned against the mantel-shelf . Charles folded his hands and looked beyond me through the window . I said to myself : Are we together ? What was together ? I did not know , and I heard again : Son , I 've got to go , and I de- ' cided that this time I would go with him , because it was so simple to go and to leave behind all the things that I would have to think about if I stayed . Then I thought how easy it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from the funeral , and come back to be with him in the back-parlor , and to have met with him the contempt of Cousin John , the courtesy of papa : how easy it would have been to have had all my feelings sim'mplified , to have felt the exultation of loyalty not to myself or to all the life around me , but to one person who to my dying day will be a man always riding off somewhere . I thought I had better go up to my room , and I started for the door , but when I came to George I stopped , and he smiled at me . " I know we 're together , son , " he said . Semmes turned around . " Well , George , what shall we do ? " He smiled at Semmes . " I thought you 'd come with me . I think we had better see Major Corse . " He looked at Charles . " We can offer him our men . " " We 'll all go to see Corse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood aside for Charles and Semmes to pass . Charles touched him on the arm . " After you , sir . " And George led the way into the hall . A few days later , after the Virginia convention had taken the State out of the Union , I was coming home from school , it must have been about four o'clock , and I saw a crowd down Washington Street gathered around thep151flag-pole . The United States flag hung limp against the pole in the windless air . I ran , and when I came to the edge of the crowd heard the steady plunk of an ax in an unnatural stillness . I pushed my way slowly into the center of the ring . A young man handed the ax to a man with gray hair , who with stiff , feeble strokes loosened a few chips , then would have fallen had not two younger men stepped forward to support him . There was still no disorder , not even talk . Men quietly awaited their turns . Just inside the circle Major Corse stood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile lighting his eyes . He looked at me but gave no sign of recognition . There was a cry , " Look out ! " The circle broke and scattered as the crackling pine fell with a crash upon the cobblestones . Before the Presidential election of 1860 , only a few months ago , supporters of the Union ticket of Bell and Everett had erected the pole , and I believe papa contributed to it . They insisted that secession was a crime , and continued to insist until this day , the 17th of April , when Mr. Lincoln 's proclamation reached us , calling for seventy-fivethousand volunteers to suppress in South Carolina " combinations too powerful to be dealt with by the courts " ; on this day they all became violent supporters of the crime . All , or nearly all , but papa ; for during secession week he seldom went abroad , staying indoors and reading the papers as never before . Cousin John Semmes came in to sit with him in the evening , but by tacit understanding there was no discussion of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to leave , he asked papa if he had n't better go back to Pleasant Hill . " No , sir , the madness will subside . " So far as papa was concerned life went on as usual  --  which meant that Coriolanus dusted the back-parlor every morning and I went to school and at night pretended to study my lessons . Boys of my own age , too young to volunteerin any of the militia companies , envied our older brothers , who would surely in a few weeks go up the river and cross the Long Bridge into Washington , and wrest the government away from the " foreigners . " We had our own excitements , our own special and immemorial ways of amusing ourselves ; but this is not my story . In the week after Charles had resigned his commission he waited at home , and we understood that he could not decide whether to join the Mt . Vernon Guards as captain or offer his services to the Confederate government . He was waiting , I think , for Colonel Lee to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that week by offering himself to the State of Virginia , not to the Confederacy , for Virginia had only declared her independence and could not officially become a part of the Confederacy untilby popular vote the Ordinance of Secession had been confirmed ; that was more than a month away . Papa said that Colonel Lee had been " precipitate , " that conservativemen would not consider the state out of the Union until the actual vote was counted , since the Ordinance had been passed under pressure from the fire-eaters , led by Henry A. Wise , a former governor of the state whose political ambitions had been frustrated by his failure to get the presidential nomination in 186o . To us , the boys , Governor Wise was already a great hero . Had he not , when he mounted the platform to speak on the last day of the convention , prefaced his remarks with a gesture of the heroic order ? He had drawn two horse-pistols from inside of his coat and dramatically laid them upon the table before him . I had heard him speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John : he was a small man with a big forehead and a sharp , angry expression.  |p153Charles  left for Richmond early the next week , accompanied by Lucy , who was eager to go , thinking that Charles might rapidly accede to high rank and thus broaden the stage of her social operations , which had been so narrow in a family headed by an old fogey who had never heard of " society . " I think Aunt Myra was divided in feeling between anxiety for Lucy 's decorum and relief to be rid of her . Charles had been commissioned major in the army of Virginia , charged with the drill and organizationof militia companies as they arrived from remote counties of the state . I did not see Charles and Lucy again until after the war . You can not imagine the rumors and alarms that filled those days , and I myself , a part of them , though a minute part , can not recall the excitement in which we lived . The clay after secession a " body of troops , " which swelled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " army , " passed mysteriously through Manassas Junction ; and in a few days we heard that the armory at Harper 's Ferry had been captured . It was a great victory , of course , and Washington would be next . But what actually came next , what seemed so important at the time of its happening , I can not remember , though I might consult the hooks and bring back the true order of events . It was at about this time , perhaps a little later , we heard that Massachusettstroops , marching through Baltimore , had been mobbed by the secessionists of Maryland . It seemed for a while that perhaps papa would be right  --  that the madness would subside , no power being great enough to subdue the bright soldiers who paraded the streets of Alexandria the Sunday after the fall of Fort Sumter had forced Virginiainto her independence . Of course we got used to war , to what after a month tit parades we thought of as war , but on that first Sunday it was a novelty that I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Semmes and George who I knew would be somewhere in the ranks of the Alexandria Rifles . After the scene with papa the Sunday before neither George nor Semmes had appeared , and we had heard only from Susan , whose weekly letter might have been written in times wholly lacking in agitation , it stuck so close to family news : the Poseys were well , Aunt Jane Anne being better after her attack of gout , Aunt Milly George as usual , and Mr. Jarman ( he never became " uncle " ) had actually only yesterday ( the 17th ) not only emerged from his room but had gone in the carriage up to Georgetown Heights because he said he did n't believe the Confederate flag was flying over the Marshall House in Alexandria ; when he saw it he got back into the carriage and told Blind Joe to take him home , that the war was over ; little Susan was getting better of the rickets and would be walking soon , " so efficacious has been the diet prescribed by Dr. Burrows , of buttermilk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busier than ever before , his engagements detaininghim until late at night . " But there was no mention of Jane Posey , and George 's " engagements " were a mystery that papa , reading the letter to Aunt Myra , acknowledgedwith a brief pause . That Sunday at dinner papa put down his knife and fork , and addressed me : " Son , it is beyond any dispute now that Colonel Lee has resigned from the army . " We had known it beyond dispute for several days , but papa had not been convinced even after Charles ' departure for Richmond ; he had at last faced it at the morning servicesat Christ Church where Miss Agnes Lee had told Aunt Myra that her father , unwilling to fight his own people , had become a private citizen ; then old Mr. Daingerfieldhad shown papa the Washington Star of the dayp155before in which Lee 's resignation was announced . " But , " papa said , " I can not understand Colonel Lee 's reasons for assuming that he would have to fight his own people . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young men from forming military companies . Lacy , " and he looked at me , " I do n't forbid you to go to the parade , but I want you to understand that we have nothing to do with Disunion . " That was the first time , I suppose , that papa had seemed to me to speak from a great distance , as if he were a man preoccupied with some private mystery that could not be connected with what was going on in the world . How easy to think that " a show of force " would disband the Alexandria Rifles and Mt . Vernon Guards ! Where in his mind were the vast hordes of young men who were rushing to village and county town , from the river bottoms and the hills , coming with squirrel rifles , shot-guns , bowie knives , to " form military companies " in Georgia , Alabama , Mississippi , by the banks of the James , the Chattahoochee , the Tennessee ? For papa , these young men did not exist ; all that country from below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the " war " was about to be fought between the " government " and the sons of his neighbors and kin in the old Northern Neck of Virginia . After the cloth had been removed I told papa that I did not care for any dessert , and could I be excused ? He let me go , and I ran upstairs to get my jacket and cap . I remember at that moment a sense of loss as I was about to close the door behind me , and I thought I had forgottensomething . I glanced about the room , in which there was never sufficient light , and the bare wall oppositeme became the wall of the " boys ' room " at Pleasant I till where my double-barreled gun rested upon its pegs . I closed the door swiftly but softly , and ran as softly down the stairs and through the front door into the street where according to appointment , down on the corner , two of my friends waited for me . They were just my age , Hank Herbertwas not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked more than our age ; he , of course , was a cousin , but our boyish code forbade our ever referring to it in the presence of other boys . When I approached there was no greeting  --  that too was an article of conduct among little savages  --  but Hank and Jack shifted a little their postures . Hank said : " Old Kenny says my pa said to beat me if I talked about enlisting . " Old Kenny was Mr. Kennelly , master of the Alexandria Academy . " Say , Lacy , you reckon Major Corse 'd take me ? " He looked about him slyly , and stuck a small plug of tobacco in the corner of his mouth . " Hell , " said Jack . " Hell , I do n't want to be a private . They ai n't any of the officers gentlemen but the Major , maybe a couple others . " " Major Corse ai n't going to take any of us , " I said . " Listen here , Jack , we got to set an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't any better'n they are . " They gave me their solemn attention , and we all felt that we had already sacrificed ourselves to the glory of the Old Dominion . As we considered it , distant strains of music came to us from the south end of town . We looked all at once up Duke Street towards Washington . " Less go , " I said . " Less go , " said Hank . " Come on , " Jack said , and he pushed Hank in the back as we started at a half trot up the street . " Say , " Jack said , " Wink Broadacre 's jined the Rifles only he ai n't got a uniform yet . " " You say he has , " I said . I had n't seen Winston Broadacrefor about three years , but I got all the news of himp157I could because his superior age and achievements made him a hero to the younger generation to which I belonged . He had been at the University for two years and surprised everybody with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yas , " Jack said , " he 's a leftenant . " He looked at me . " Hell , you ought a know that . Hell , did n't your brotherin-lawtell Major Corse Wink had to be made an officer ? " We slowed to a walk . Hank looked worried . " Shut up , Jack , you ought n't to be telling that . " I had n't heard a word about it but I pretended I had . " Yas , Brother George is mighty patriotic . " An embarrassed silence fell upon my companions . I had to lift it . " Well , anyhow he made all the Georgetown boys come over here and enlist , did n't he ? And he give enough muskets for two companies . Ai n't that patriotism ? " " It sho is , " said Hank . " Look here , Lace , it 's a dern shame Mr. Posey wa' n't made an officer , after all he 's done . My pa says it is . He says Mr. Posey ought a been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one with the Georgetown boys in it .... " " Well , " I said knowingly , " maybe Brother George do n't want to be cap'n , maybe he wants to be a private . " " Huh , " Jack said , " you wait and see . " As we came to the corner of Duke and Washington the sounds of the distant band were more distinct . " Let 's wait here for them to pass , " I said . " Naw , " Jack said , " we better go up to Prince . " That was where the speaking was going to be . We walked fast . As we came to the end of the block the crowd thickened , mostly boys like us or Negroes who milled about in clusters ; across the street there were white people only , young girls dressed in bonnets and hoops . Out in the middle of the street at the crossing of the four corners stood a wooden platform about three feet high and big enough for not more than four or five men to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street : far away , probably , as far as South Street near Hunting Creek we saw the head of the column with two indistinguishable flags in the lead . It seemed a half hour before I could make out the features of the white , serious face of the leading colorbearer , a young man I had never seen ; then the band struck up an air , the new tune of " The Bonny Blue Flag , " and a loud hand-clapping preceded the wild cheer that I was to hear later in the dusty fields of war . The first color-bearer carried the flag of Virginia ; a few paces ' behind him came one of the older Herbert boys , a cousin of Hank 's , carrying a small replica of the flag that had been flying since Friday over the Marshall House  --  two horizontal bands , red and white , with , in the upper lefthandcorner , a blue field containing a single white star . The first company was the Rifles , perfectly uniformed in dark blue , white shoulder belts crossed over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like pictures of soldiers in the Mexican War . After them came the Mt . Vernon Guards , similarly dressed but with different insignia . The Rifles marched across the square and formed in line facing towards the platform . The Guards turned left into Prince Street , and about-faced . The next companyhad only a sprinkling of uniforms , few of them matching , and the arms were muskets , shotguns , sabers , pistols , and pikes . As it came opposite us I stared at a familiar face , an officer , sword at shoulder , dressed in the new , beautiful bluish gray of the South . It was Winston Broadacre . When he came near enough to the curb for me almost to touch him , I said in a low voice that penetratedthe shouts : " Hello , Wink . " He turned an impassive , grim-looking young face un- 59seeingly in my direction . Then his eyes narrowed into a smile . " Howdy , Lacy , " he said without change of expression . As his company turned the corner to the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I turned away to keep my companions from seeing until I had fought them back . I said , " Say , I 'd sho like to enlist . " " So would I , " said Hank . " I reckon I will pretty soon , " Jack said . We looked at ( Ile next company . About half of the men were uniformed and I suddenly recognized them ; they were the National Rifles from Georgetown . I felt a little tense . The first lace my eyes fixed was the solemn features of Brother Semmes ; he wore the uniform of a private in the National Rifles ; and except that when he turned his head in our direction his eyelids drooped , I should not have known that he saw me . Then I noticed a difference between this company and the one that had preceded it : although half of the men were without uniforms , every man had a new shining rifle , with bayonet fixed  --  the muskets that Brother George had so patriotically supplied ! I was looking down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's that man there ? " He pointed towards a man of middle height , powerfully built and of swarthy complexion , who marched with drawn sword outside the column and near its head . Before I really saw him I realized that he was the aptain . I kept staring at the tinge of gray in the long hair over his ears . It astonished me ; then I knew why : it had delayed my recognition of a man I had known from infancy . " He 's Mister John , " I said ; then , " I mean Mr. John Langton , he 's our neighbor in the country . " " He 's cap'n , " Hank said.  |p160I  pretended not to hear , turning to look at the file closers who brought up the rear of a column that seemed to me a great army . It was about five hundred men , but that was more than twice as many as the Rifles and Guards could have mustered a week ago . Captain Langton 's companyhalted in front of us . The four streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing at order-arms . The cheering subsided , and I heard the rapid clatter of hooves from the direction of Duke Street . A body of horsemen was turning into Washington ; they came at a quick trot past the halted company . At the head rode Major Corse , dressed like Wink Broadacre in gray , followed by five or six dignitaries rigged out in odds and ends of military regalia . They dismounted at the platform : one man I gazed at narrowly and recognized as Cousin John : the only military touch about him was a tightly buttoned , double-breasted coat of dark blue ; the buttons were silver ; and he wore a soft gray hat . Cousin John and Major Corse talked in a low tone , looking from the bunched horses to the crowd , and then at the men in the ranks . Cousin John shook his head : No , I was sure he was saying , we ca n't ask gentlemen to hold our horses . They had forgotten to appoint an orderly . I stepped down from the curb into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " Go on , " he said . I caught Cousin John 's eye ; he nodded and I ran forward as if I were beingpursued . The gentlemen handed me their bridles : as Cousin John handed me his I looked at his horse  --  it was the bay mare , Queen Susie . I drew the horses together into a half circle , looking over my shoulder towards Captain Langton 's company . The captain slouched with his left hand at his hip , the point of his sword resting upon the toe of his right boot , which was slightly advanced . He looked insolent , humorless , and bored . Queen Susie tossedp161her head , giving the bridle a stiff yank , and I knew that Brother George should have been standing in John Langton'splace , and then I realized , after the diverting excitement , that in all that vast host of men  --  I still considered t hem a host  --  I had not seen George Posey , and that John Langton , his enemy , had marched at the head of his  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind on the ceremoniesfor wondering how George 's mare had got there ; as Cousin John mounted the platform with professional dignity . I could not understand why he , also in his way George 's enemy , should have ridden his horse . But I did know this : that George Posey was in town , and I imaginedhim somewhere in the crowd , a stranger here as everywhere , looking down on the ceremonies from his great height , his eyes half closed in his backward tilted head . " Citizens of Alexandria ! "  --  Cousin John was standing a little apart from the other men , holding his hat across his chest . " Fellow Citizens , I have the pleasure of announcingto you , under authority received by telegraph from Governor Letcher , the formation of the Seventeenth Regiment of Virginia Infantry . This regiment is at presentcomposed of the gallant men and patriots assembled upon this occasion . Their ranks "  --  he paused  --  " their ranks , should the emergency require , will be doubled overnight ! " The shouts of at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last Cousin John raised his hand for silence . " It is the devout and burning wish of every patriot that this cruel emergency may pass . " IIe paused and surveyed the crowd amid whose silence a hoof on the cobblestones could have been heard a block away . His mouth widened almost into a smile , and he nodded his head slowly and repeatedly . At last , under the spell of the expert demagogue , there was laughter in thep162ranks which was taken up by the crowd who suddenly broke into cheers . Again Cousin John gestured , half bowing , for silence . " Now , my friends , I come to the greatest pleasure of all . I have the signal honor to presentto you your neighbor , kinsman , and friend : he will be known henceforth , until the honor of further promotion , as Colonel Montgomery Corse , commander of the Seventeenth Virginia ! " There was more cheering as Cousin John stepped back and Colonel Corse moved forward with a long sheet of paper in his hand . He stood calm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , firmly on his head . He raised the paper and began to read . I turned my back on the platformthe better to manage the horses ; looking between them I saw in the crowd , back against the wall of the corner house , the impassive face of Brother George surveying the scene. " ... that our first allegiance is due to Virginia ; that we will obey her commands and abide by her fortunes ; that in her defense against all assailants whatsoever we are ready to risk life and all that renders life desirable . To this we pledge the faith of soldiers and the sacred affectionof sons . " The silence in which the crowd had received the Colonel 's speech continued : when it broke I was brought sharply out of the superior reality that George 's face had created for me . I had heard again his anguish in the shadowyback-parlor  --  " they think of nothing but marriage and death and the honor of Virginia . " You will understand , of course , that the honor of Virginia meant something to me ; yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; words that would ordinarily have moved me as it had moved the crowd , to shouts and tears , had been far away , and I knew what it was to be apart from thep163emotions that all men shared ; I suppose I came nearer , there in the street holding his mare , to seeing the world through George Posey 's eyes than I had ever come before . Before the cheering began I fancied I had caught his eye , and a gleam of this communion flashed to me . Before I knew it the officers were taking their horses from me . Cousin John , flushed with his exertion , said : " Lead her down to the Marshall House . George 'll get her there . " When I turned round to start , the fierce yells struck me : the crowd and the soldiers had melted as I slowly made way for the big mare in the direction of King Street . When I came to the Marshall House the crowd was thinning away . I tied Queen Susie at the hitching-rack around on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I expected to find Brother George . He was nowhere to be seen . I hesitated before I could decide to enter : I had been forbidden to go into taverns , but I remembered it was Sunday , the bar would be closed , and I had a definite mission . ( Gadsby 's I think was considered a more genteel place , but one of the early Gadsbys had been a " speculator , " that is , a Negro trader , and papa was deadwtagainst the very name . Mr. Jackson , the proprietor of the Marshall House , was an excellent man . ) I walked through the front door into the dim little " office . " There were some strange men leaning upon the desk , behind which , on the wall , was a rack upon which a few keys hung from wooden pegs . Against the opposite wall stood a row of big unpainted chairs flanked at each end by large hr ass cuspidors . Most of the chairs were occupied by men silently smoking cigars . I walked up to the desk. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Mr. Jackson gave me a polite glance followed by recognition . " Lacy , what can I do for you ? " I waited for the rest of what he would surely say , but got instead only an urbane stare . " I am looking for Mr. Posey , sir . " " I expect he 'll be in here in a minute . " He turned away , but he too had felt his omission , and he looked at me again . He had a strong , shrewd face , partly concealed by a wide black mustache . " Son , " he said , " I hope that your father is well . " He paused . " I have n't seen him all this past week . I feel that people are entitled to differencesof opinion . " He said it coldly and turned again to the men . " By God , " he said in a loud voice , " if Yankee soldiers enter this town they 'll be greeted by two fourpoundersfrom my back yard . I 've got ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one of the chairs quickly folded his newspaper , and walked out of the hotel . All eyes followed him . " Too hot for him , " one of the strange men said . I heard footsteps descending the stairs in the back of the room . It was George . He smiled at me , without speaking , walked to the desk and laid a key upon it . " Five dollars , sir , " said Mr. Jackson . George took five silver dollars out of his trousers ' pocket and stacked them neatly upon the desk . He had evidently been in Alexandriafor nearly a week but he had not come near us : what had he been doing ? He came to me at the end of the desk . " Semmes wants you to go over and visit us in Georgetown , Lacy , " he said . I said nothing . " Your pa sent him a message . " I was bewildered . " School ai n't over yet , Brother George , " I said.  | 65The front door opened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John entered . There was no greeting except that George nodded to them , and Mr. Jackson moved quickly to the back of the office and opened a door into a private dining room . He waited until we had disappeared through the door , then closed it , remainingon the outside . The three men sat down round the bare table . " Be seated , son , " Cousin John said . I sat down in a chair near the door , against the wall . He looked from me to the stranger , and back at me . He said to the stranger : " The boy is my kinsman . We may proceed . " George took out of a long wallet a sheaf of papers and laid them before him . The stranger produced what seemed to me an identical sheaf , handing it to Cousin John , who put on his spectacles and with pencil poised in the air looked at George . George began reading in a brisk modulatedvoice . " Two thousand pair of shoes . " Cousin John made a mark on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cousin John checked again . " Two thousandstand of new Springfield muskets . " Cousin John made his mark , and the same proceedings went on for another half hour . There was a pause at the end . George looked at the stranger . " Mr.  --  , " he began , then glanced at me . " Well , sir , " he said , " I have furnished eighty-two Enfield rifles to Company D of the new Seventeenth Virginia . " The stranger looked at Cousin John , who said : " Mr. Posey equipped these men while they were still in the National Rifles of Georgetown . " " I understand , " the stranger said , " that the company was mustered in equipped . If Mr. Posey wishes to be reimbursedhe will have to get the captain of that company to make requisition for a voucher . " " I 'm damned if I 'll do that , sir , " George said . The strange man looked taken aback ; he lowered his eyes . " Mr. Posey , I can do nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it . " He rose , and placing the handbag on the table , said : " Here are sixty-one thousand dollars in gold and gold certificates of the Federal Government . Do you wish to count it ? " George got up . Cousin John struggled to his feet and produced a small flask of whiskey . He reached for three whiskey glasses on a side table , set them in a row , and poured drinks . George raised his glass . " No , sir , it wo n't be necessary to count it . " He put the glass down . Cousin John and the stranger tossed off their drinks . " How much longer can you do this business ? " asked the stranger . George 's cold eyes shone . " I can do it as long as the fords ai n't guarded . The goods are consigned to me at Frederick , and the teams have no trouble crossing White 's Ford . " The stranger said nothing . He backed away from the table , bowed , and left the room . George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , ignoring Cousin John and me , till at last he said : " If I had n't told the boys to do it they would n't have acceptedLangton as cap'n . Now , Mr. Semmes , " he said lookingstraight at Cousin John , " do you think it right and just that I should arm John Langton 's company ? " " Well , George , I reckon it ai n't precisely just , sir . " Cousin John sat down and fingered the rim of his empty glass . George turned toward the door . He came back to pick up the satchel . " Lacy , I have business tonight . I may not get home till tomorrow some time . You ride Queen Susie over in the morning . Your pa will give his consent . " Satchel in hand , he addressed Cousin John . " Mr. Semmes , your people are about to fight a war . They remind me ofp167a passel of young ' uns playing prisoners ' base . Good evening , sir . " And he opened the door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved towards the table . Cousin John stared at the empty glass . " Well , Lacy , you better do as George says . It would kill your pa if you enlisted . " " Why wa' n't Brother George made cap'n , Cousin John ? " " Maybe it ai n't just , but he ought to be willing to be a private , damn it ! " Cousin John hit the table with his fat list . " Lacy , George Posey ai n't from Alexandria . The Seventeenthis the Alexandria regiment . " " Mister John ai n't from Alexandria either , " I said . Cousin John gave me a shrewd glance . " But he 's a Virginian . That 's the difference  --  he 's a Virginian . " He pinched his dewlap meditatively . " Do n't expect George to come to see your pa . Your pa 's Union sentiments are embarrassing to him in this ticklish business he 's doing . Lacy , George is serving the cause as much as if he had a musket . And it 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He got up . " Come on , let 's see how your pa is . " When we came to the door , I said in a low voice : " Cousin John , ai n't Brother George one of our people ? " " Good God , boy , what a question ! Go and get the mare . II George got caught , the next place you 'd see him would be the Old Capitol Prison where his friend Schaeffer is . Now let 's go . " I went round to the hitching-rack , untied the bridle , mounted Queen Susie , and started at a trot towards FairlaxStreet . I turned down Fairfax , and in a couple of minutes I dismounted in front of our house . I looked up and down the melancholy red brick and at the windows where the blinds were closely drawn . I decided to wait outside and to go in with Cousin John when he came.  |p168I  came to the head of the Long Bridge next evening at sundown , and I got by the sentries without trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgetown , " I said , and the sergeant of the picket said , " Search him , " which the men did very carelessly ; and I walked the mare over the bridge . By the time I had gone the length of Virginia Avenue to the Water Street Bridge into Georgetown , it was nearly dark , and , to keep from getting lost in the maze of narrow streets , I continued along Water Street and followed it into town , until I came to the end of Frederick Street , where it suddenly pitches from the heights above down to Water Street and the canal . I dismounted at the foot of Frederick lest Queen Susie slip in ascending the steep , cobbled grade . At the top I mounted her again , and in two minutes I came to Vista Avenue and drew rein at the carriage gate of the Posey house . I sat in the saddle to listen for I know not what . I looked down the river where a few yellow lights were slowly moving . On the Maryland side I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house before me was dark . I heard footsteps behind the gate , then a low voice : " Is that you , Marse Lacy ? " " Vas , " I said . " This yere 's Joe , " the voice said . The gate opened towards me , I dismounted , and Blind Joe took the bridle , and led the mare towards the stables in the rear , and disappeared . I stood on the brick driveway trying to hear something . Low , indistinguishable voices came from the servants ' quarters beyond the stable at the rear of the garden . I knew that the garden ran all the way round the other side of the house and fronted on the 69street where a high stone wall shut it in . I looked up at the rear windows ; they were dark . I walked quietly over to the garden and found myself at the entrance to a narrowpath which was blocked by dense , unpruned shrubs . The voices ceased . I had better go to the side door . I turned to the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to the little door that the Poseys called the " wicket . " There was no knocker . I pushed on the handle , but the door was locked . Before I knew what I was doing I was knocking hard upon the door . There was no response . I cried , " Sister , sister ! Here I am . " I waited about a minute . " Sister ! " I cried again . It seemed an hour but it was only a few minutes before I heard slow footsteps inside , and the key turned in the lock . In the silence that followed the door did not open . I said quickly , " It 's Lacy Buchan . " The door opened with a squeak , and an old Negro woman said peevishly , " Why n't you come to de front door ? " She held in her gnarled fingers a battered tin candlestick in which the candle had almost burned down to the socket . She turned abruptly , I entered and closed the door . " Do n't make no noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ole Miss was of course Aunt Jane Anne . I followed the old woman up the short flight of steps into the main hall . She disappeared in the rear of the house where I heard her muffled feet ascending the back stairs . I moved into the front hall where a candle was burning weakly in a wall bracket at the foot of the main staircase . Now where shall I go , I thought , how shall I find sister if I ca n't make any noise ? I was trying to think it out . Staring at the face of old Jeremaiah Gibson in the portrait hanging over the candle , I took in his features one by one  --  the harsh , ascetic eyes , the small mouth , the bulging forehead . Well , I said to myself with serious irrelevance , thep170old man will never help me . I had better go right up to her room . I could see that the upper hall was dark , so I seized a candlestick on the small table near the front door , and lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of the stairs , which wound round the back of the hall , the lower hall spread before me in its mellow amplitude : the ceilingwas so high that from where I stood I might have been peering into a deep , torch-lit cavern , a bright place surrounded by darkness . It was only the fancy of a boy that for an instant peopled the hall with gay young figures , bright faces and laughter at the end of a soiree , saying Good-bye , good-bye , and then I almost heard it like a voice : Good-bye . I started towards the front rooms : the upper hall was heavily carpeted and I made no sound . When I had got about halfway down the hall I heard a door open behind me ; I halted and waited for somebody to speak . There was no voice but I knew that the door was still open . I turned quickly and saw peeping from a door which was open about six inches , a dim face that seemed to have no support below it , being wedged tightly between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face , and the improprietyof my situation grew upon me , but the even greater impropriety of speech kept me silent ; I waited for the face to utter a word or to disappear . It stared ; then it suddenlywithdrew and the door closed with a soft click . The front room on the right was Aunt Jane Anne 's ; the room on the left , sister 's . I knocked gently upon her door . I heard regular but quiet footsteps , broken by regular short pauses . When there was no cessation of the steps I knocked again . They ceased abruptly . The door opened , and sister stood before me . Without a word she backed away ; I enteredand closed the door . She kissed me upon the cheekp171and , though I was inches taller than she , she put her arms about my shoulders as if I were a child , and walked me over to a chair by the slow fire . She remained standing . I thought she was handsomer than I had ever seen her : she had evidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waist over the folds and ruffles of a white negligee . I ler face was marble-white and her eyes were calm . " How is papa ? " she said . My hands were not cold , but I held them to the fire . " Sister , " I said , " who peeped at me out in the hall , I mean from the back bedroom ? " " That was Aunt Milly , " she said , but she did not smile . " Papa is well . " I hoped she would say something . She sat down in a small rocker . " Papa , " I said , " is well . " I looked at her . " I wa' n't going to enlist , sister . " She gazed at me but said nothing . She turned her eyes towards the fire , then rose and walked to the narrow door into the adjoining room , which was the nursery . Presently she came back , and I followed her steps over the worn track in the carpet that ran from the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes traced out another worn place running from the dismal tester bed to the prie-dieu that stood behind me near the mantelpiece against the wall : sister , not being a Catholic , had profanely dropped her sewing upon the lectern . I was waiting for her to sit down , hut she remained standing , her hands clasped before her ; it was the first time I had not been able to say to sister whatever came into my mind , the first time I had no chatter , nothing being in my mind to say . She looked tired . I kept my eyes on the floor ; directly I found myself tracing out still another of those confounded tracks on the carpet , this time it was over by the far front window , a short lath of five or six feet , and it looked different from the others , as if the nap had just been taken off , leaving thep172fiber clean where the fiber of the older tracks looked faded and aged . " How is little Jane ? " I said . Her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her father . " She sat down in the rocker . " Sister , " I said , " you look tired . " " I do n't sleep well . Not since George went into the army . " I hardly knew what to make of that . Sister asked : " Did n't papa send any messages ? " Of course he had sent messages , but I could not remember how he had worded them ; so I said bluntly : " Papa said for me to protect you . " Sister put her face into her hands . When she looked up and spoke her voice was difficult . " I need no protection , Lacy ; it 's papa who needs it . Poor papa  --  what will become of him ? " After a few months I remembered her words and knew that I had not understood them , that I had not even known there was anything to understand . " Sister , " I said suddenly , " why did Miss Milly peep out at me ? " " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocked back and forth a little . And then she said , calmly as if she were merely explaining why the Washington Monument had not been finished : " It is no wonder he is the way he is  --  I mean my husband , Lacy , he 's so fine , but he 's so violent . " She pressed her eyelids with thumb and forefinger , then placed her hands in her lap . " People have got to get life where they can , that 's all there is to it . That 's why Aunt Milly peeps  --  it makes her live . " She seemed to be thinking about it , but I could n't ask her to go on . " Lacy , had n't you better go to bed , you know upstairs in the south bedroom ; I know you 're tired . " Ip173tired ? I had never been tired in my life . I did not move . " Sister , Brother George ai n't in the army . Mr. John Langton 's cap'n of the company with the Georgetown boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it , but some instinct told . me that she had better know . She rose and walked to the nearer window , putting a hand against the casement : a posture that she must often have taken , only now she looked at the blank , closed blinds ; yet she was obliviousof them , and of her purpose in standing there . " Then I do n't know where my husband has been for a week . " She had turned to face me , but now she went over to the bed and sat against it , running both hands under her smooth , loose hair . I looked again at the fire , and there was a long silence . When she spoke again I was startled : I heard her voice like a harsh echo a few seconds after she had spoken . " When I was a girl at Pleasant Hill I could n't have known about this . " As I was taking in all that it meant , the stillness of the house was broken by the big clock in the lower back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to myself after the last one : nine . " I thought they were just two peculiar old ladies , " she said in a low , excited tone . " I was so young I could n't know that they were n't really old . And George was so handsome and independent . He still is , " she said . " But he 's always living somewhere else . He never talks to me . Ile comes upstairs and talks to little Jane and smiles . " She came over to the fire and started to sit down . She stood by the chair . " Well , Lacy , good night . " I got up and started for the door . " Come kiss me good night , Lacy . " I went back to her , then stopped to face her . " Sister , why did you send for me ? I know papa did n't think of it . Why did you send for me ? "  | " Yes , Lacy , I sent for you , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her . " They do n't know  --  they think nothing is happening . Why , Mr. Jarman 's on , y been out of the house once  --  last Sunday  --  in a year . He walks the floor reciting his compositions . " She smiled . " I walk the floor too . I suppose we all get that way ! " She came forward and held me by the shoulders . She kissed me . " Good night , Lacy . " There was a knock at the door , and I felt as if I had been surprised or menaced in some way wholly unforeseen . Sister gazed steadily into my eyes , and without movingher gaze , she said in a slightly raised tone : " Come in , Jane . " She kept looking at me as the doorknob moved timidly , and I said in a flash to myself ; she has n't mentioned Semmes ! Had she thought about him ? And I had n't mentionedJane , but that was because for some reason I had not thought of her . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , came into the room with short , modest steps . She saw me without surprise , then looked inquiringly at sister . " Jane , here 's Lacy , " sister said , and it would have sounded foolish anywhere else . " Hello , " Jane said to me . I said , " Hello , Jane . " I glanced furtively and saw that her eyes were on the floor . " Have you done your French ? " asked sister . " Yes 'm , " Jane said . Her eyes were still downcast , but there was something grown-up in her face that I had not seen there before ; it was as if her features had settled into the mold of maturity round the chin and eyes , leaving the mouth to be attended to later on : the mouth still had the submissive droop , or was it the mouth ? Or is it ever any feature that means anything ? I tried to think whatp175I meant by the submissiveness of her mouth , but I could n't ; I suppose there was something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I knew only that I wanted to see her alone : perhaps sister would let me walk with her to the convent next day when she went up for her music lesson . Sister was looking from me to Jane . She was taller than sister ; it was only pretense that kept her a moment longer a child . " Jane has come for her prayers , " sister said , smiling at ane . I went to the door and turned around , ready in my embarrassment to make a bow to Jane ; but she had not changed her position ; so I said , " Good night , " and as sister smiled at me I opened the door and went upstairs . At the door into the south bedroom , where I had stayed before , I remembered again that Susan had not mentionedSemmes . Why had I not thought of Jane ? Well , I should have to get used to her in this house where people were either in rooms or about , irrevocably , to go into them . I could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room and the satin slipper lying on its side on the floor . Two days later I received a letter from papa saying that he was getting along well , but that old Lucy Lewis had been found dead in her bed , and Coriolanus and Henry had driven the body to Pleasant Hill for burial ; but that lie had not gone himself " which I much regret , as the respectin which Aunt Lucy was held by our family was such as to warrant the tenderest devotion to the memory of her conspicuous , if humble virtues ; but the weather suddenly becoming inclement , I had to forego the duty . Your Aunt Myra leaves today for Falls Church : I alludep176to her depature chiefly for dear Susan 's eye , since our dear daughter may wish to drive to her Uncle Armistead in what may be his last illness . I am pained , my dear son , to deepen further the melancholy of this epistle with the recital of another misfortune . Your Cousin John Semmes , according to advices just received in Alexandria , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Major Stone : while I can not condone the unlawful arrest , which was executed in contempt of a writ of habeas corpus , yet his pronounced secessionist activities have made him subject to this action . It appears that he must languish , in the company of other disunionists , in Fort Delaware . He was charged with smuggling materials of war from Pennsylvania into Virginia . I can not conceive why I had not heard about this activity ... " Well , papa , I said to myself , I can ! Poor papa , who still thought that his neighbors alone were perversely opposing the Federal Government ! I glanced again at what I had read : had Brother George been arrested too ? No , I decided ; we should have heard it .. " I come now to a piece of news that has been received by our friends here with wild demonstrationsof delight . Even my friend Daingerfield at his age was seen to jump up and down with excitement . I was dumfounded . Robert Lee has accepted the post of generalin-chiefof the Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States Army to be a gesture of neutrality , a position with which I feel a considerable sympathy ; although I felt and do still feel that in so far as one must be swayed by faction , one ought to support the authority of the Federal Government . Alas , my son , there are every day fewer and fewer of our people in Alexandria . Now in closing this tedious communication I must advert briefly to your present situation . I did not feel that you would enlist without my consent , yet it is myp177desire to remove you from the sphere of excitement and temptation , and the influence of your Brother . Last night I had a painful interview with that young man . Semmes came in a few minutes after supper . I commanded him to resign from his company , saying that I would send in to John Langton a request that his name be dropped from the rolls on the ground that membership in an organizationsworn to uphold disunion was inconsistent with the views of his family . Semmes stubbornly held that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and without passion , that he was no longer a son of mine . I can not but feel that my other son George Posey 's influence has placed Semmes in this position , although George himselfseems to have reconsidered and returned to his family , where I presume he is conducting his business as usual . That is a mode of conduct that all men should pursue  --  business as usual ; our present troubles for sheer lack of attention would subside . Give to Susan and infant my dearest love and convey to the Posey ladies my respects . Yrs . my son till Death do us part , L. Buchan . " I had by this time come to my own idea of George 's " influence " on Semmes ; it was not an influence but an exchangein which each got from the other what he could not supply for himself . I can see George Posey from his boyhood in the dark halls of the Posey house , then emerginginto the bright light of day ; you must try to imagine him after he got outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Rozier Posey , had died while he was still a small boy : I never knew much about him but the tales of his secrecy of action and brutality of character have done a good deal in later years to explain the extreme refinement of sensibility of which Aunt Jane Anne and I suppose Jane also were the victims , and George too in his curious way . The family did not live the normal life of their times  --  that , I suppose , is what it all comes down to . Old Mr. Posey had left the plantation , but he was a rich man , and , in town , the family could not merge into the small middle class of folks who were beginning to rise . The women particularly had nothing to do . And Mr. Jarman  --  many years younger than his brother  --  who had wanted to be a man of letters , could not find anybody else who wanted him to be one ; so be became a recluse , a kind of Roderick Usher , whose nerves could bear whatever reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , which looked out upon the river . There is much less fantasy in Poe 's creation than most people think : Usher was just like Mr. Jarman  --  Poe had a prophetic insight  --  forMr . Jarman , like Usher , had had so long an assuredliving that he no longer knew that it had a natural source in human activity ; and I suppose he began from his early manhood to retire upon himself . I doubt if heredity had anything to do with it . Aunt Jane Anne was not a Posey , but a Gibson : she was a gentlewoman who became in the common sense more and more " gentle " as she got older , and ended up by not being able to entertain longer than a minute any thought that did not concern her health and her feelings . There was a wonderful story about her that I picked up somewhere as a boy : how , as a young woman , perhaps as a bride , she had been high-spirited ; how , when once late at night " Mr. Posey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him : she had got the Negro girls to sew two sheets together ; she had spread the sheets out at the top of the stairs ; when " Mr. Posey " with great effort achieved the flight , she with her own hand tripped him with a poker , and as he lay there in a stupor , she sewed him up in the sheets and then horse-whipped him into sobriety . How could she have done it ? Her handsp179were small and waxen , her feet like birds ' feet , and her voice so gentle it was a marvel that she spoke at all . I should say that the Poseys were more refined than the Buchans , but less civilized . I never saw a letter written by George Posey ; he must have written letters , but I can not imagine them . In the sense of today nobody wrote personalletters in our time : letters conveyed the sensibility in society , the ordered life of families and neighborhoods . George Posey was a man without people or place ; he had strong relationships , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all personal ; even his affection for his mother was personal and disordered , and it was curious to see them together : the big powerful man of action remainedthe mother 's boy . What else could he have been ? What life was there for him in the caverns of the Posey house ? What life was there for him outside it ? That was what , as I see it , he was trying to find out . If he had been poor , he would have gone out West ; well off as he was , he might have gone West anyhow if it had not been for the " ailing mother . " I never heard of his considering the West , and I am sure that he never did . He had great energy and imagination and , as Cousin John said , he had to keep moving ; but where ? I always come back to the horsemanriding off over a precipice . It is as good a figure as any other . And that is what he gave to Semmes  --  mystery and imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no bounds . What Semmes gave to him was what he most needed but never could take : Semmes gave him first of all Susan , and then  --  papa being absolutely wrong about this  --  he tried to give him what the Poseys had lost : an idea , a cause , an action in which his personalitycould be extinguished , and it seemed as if George had succeeded in becoming a part of something greaterp18o than he : the Confederate cause . That afternoon in the back-parlor in Alexandria Semmes had hesitated out of consideration for papa , not in irresolution ; he could wait a few days because he knew where he stood in a belief that was to him , as to thousands of young men , a religion . But George Posey had to act at once if he was to be certain of acting at all outside his own feelings ; there could be no delay or he would lose hold of his purpose and be temporarilydiverted , as he actually was , by the appearance of John Langton as captain of his company  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . In a world in which all men were like him , George would not have suffered  --  and he did suffer  --  the shock of communion with a world that he could not recover ; while that world existed , its piety , its order , its elaborate rigamarole  --  his own forfeitedheritage  --  teased him like a nightmare in which the dreamer dreams a dream within a dream within another dream of something that he can not name . All violent people secretly desire to be curbed by something that they respect , so that they may become known to themselves . If I had been old enough or had had the occasion to think of it , I should have known the meaning of George Posey 's refusal to attend my mother 's corpse to its grave ; I should have seen into his terrific joke , there at the end of that day , about Semmes ' cutting up cadavers , when he wrested Susan away from her father so that he might escort his ailingmother home ; I should have been less embarrassed and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the behavior of the little Durham bull . It was the only letter I ever received from papa , so I put it away in a bureau drawer , where years later , after they were all dead but Brother George , old Aunt Milly ,  |p181and  myself , and I was living in the Posey house while I finished my studies at the Columbian Medical College , I found it again : a curious spark of life still glowing with the public and private passions of its time ! Old Uncle Armistead , dead at eighty-two , saved from the new world for which he would have had only a curse and a watering eye : the gallant John Semmes  --  dead , his cynicism , his urbanity , and his kindness having rotted away in the damp casemates of Fort Delaware : Mr. Jarman , before the war was over , dead of a slow consumption that ( who knows ? ) may have hastened to its end under influences of which we should not have credited Mr. Jarman with being aware  --  the subtle pressure of near and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the unacknowledgedinfluence of the sun-spots on the tone of a letter or on the feelings that one communicates in the clasp of a hand . Well , I did go walking with Jane : one morning early in May  --  it was not the first time  --  sister asked me to walk up to the convent and carry Jane 's music roll , and if I eared to , she added , I might wait in the college grounds until the lesson was over and accompany her home . You will remember that ladies did not then go out on the street without escort or a female companion , though it was permissible for a lady to go abroad alone in a vehicle driven by a servant . Why Blind Joe , who usually drove bane the three squares to the convent , began to have other duties in the morning , I did not know ; yet I soon saw that Susan for a reason of her own let me see Jane two or three times a day , and even told me to keep Jane company itt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harpsicord . It had been a pleasant room and I suppose it still was , because every morning one of the house-girls came in and opened the blinds and dusted and swept to make it bright for the callers that never came , but this routine attested to a more social era in the past , before the unused Victorian parlor , with its what-not loaded with bric-a-brac , had r -- placed the eighteenth century withdrawing room in which the ladies of the family played backgammon , whist , or cribbage all day . But that time was gone ; one stepped into the parlor and was cut off from the Posey world of closed upstairs rooms , a world where people communicated only through their infirmities , in hushed voices , a world in which the social acts became privacies : the family never dined together , and while I was there that spring in the lull before the violence , Susan , Jane , and I sat at great distances from one another at the long walnut table and were waited on by two sullen Negro women who could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not since Brother George had sold Yellow Jim , the butler , had there been any dining service ; the other Negroes had not been taught , and Susan took food grimly from the Negro women without ever correcting them . " They are not my servants , " she once said to me . Nor was Jane her daughter , yet imperceptibly all the care and education of the girl had fallen upon Susan , who , I must say , had assumed the duty with a little more than her usual intensity , saying that Aunt Jane Anne 's invalidismhad made her own course clear to her . But was that the reason ? I doubted it . Everything I had heard or seen dated the beginning of her care from the day of my mother 's funeral , when it had been obvious that at almost any momentJane would cease to be a child : if one cared to see , as if it were a picture , the beginning of Susan 's responsibility one could bring before the mind that particular moment in the old parlor at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coffin of my mother , and Susan had come in to catch Semmes at the very instant he hadp183become for the first time aware of the whole person of Jane  --  the lovely insipidity of her docile eyes , the constantly parted lips , and the languid posture that was yet instinct with a vitality that men paused to observe , with the remark : " What a pretty girl ! " when she was not pretty at all . It was doubtless this vitality in the innocence of a sixteenyear-oldgirl that made her attractive to men ; if indeed she was attractive to more men than Semmes and myself ; for I never saw the girl except at Pleasant Hill and in Georgetown ; and I confess that in the past year I had thought to myself more than once : " How nice it would be to be married to Brother George 's sister ! " Do not people fall in love in order to share with the loved one a secret of life that they imagine she possesses ? I say " she " because women seldom feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questionbut that Susan had been fascinated by George 's mysteriouspower , by his secrecy and his violence ; but she wanted not power , nor secrecy , nor violence , except in so far as she could employ them to subdue those qualities in George Posey . She could not have known that George was outside life , or had a secret of life that no one had heard of at Pleasant Hill . To Susan the life around her in childhoodhad been final ; there could be no other , there never had been any other way of life  --  which is , I suppose , a way of saying that people living in formal societies , lacking the historical imagination , can imagine for themselves only a timeless existence : they themselves never had any origin anywhere and they can have no end , but will go on forever . When I was a small boy I used to watch my mother wash what she called the " good china " after dinner : Coriolanus brought to the dining-room two enameledbasins and set them before her , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time , all the china on the table . She washed each piece in the suds of the one basin , and 84 rinsed it in the clear water of the other , then wiped it dry with a little napkin . If this little ritual of utility  --  not very old to be sure but to my mother immemorial  --  had beer discredited or even questioned , she would have felt that the purity of womanhood was in danger , that religion and morality were jeopardized , and that infidels had wickedly asserted that the State of Virginia ( by which she meant her friends and kin ) was not the direct legatee of the civilization of Greece and Rome . In Susan too there was a great deal of this : she could not have imagined a family that did not live by rigid order wherein everything meant something , whose meaning had been long agreed upon . The Posey ladies were not eccentric , not " two peculiar old ladies , " but rather excessively refined sensibilities that had let their social tradition lapse in personal self-indulgence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sifting through the blinds , the remote threat of rain  --  into which , of course , they would not have ventured  --  became the overwhelming concerns of life . Aunt Jane Anne drank coffee all night , and nobody had ever seen Miss Milly eat anything but overripe bananas . On the rare occasions when they came downstairs to chatterwith some of the old ladies of the town , Miss Milly would vaguely sniff if money , childbirth , or poverty were mentioned , and Aunt Jane Anne could not admit that common people were real  --  " It is just too painful that they should exist . " Once when I was a small boy a neighbor 's bull had been brought to Pleasant Hill , and some young girls asked mother what he was doing there . " He 's here on business , " my mother said , and looking back to that remarkI know that she was a person for whom her small world held life in its entirety , and for whom , through that knowledge , she knew all that was necessary of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Poseys , one morning , I believe , when I was with sister and we thought we heard Brother George coming up the stairs ( it was only Blind Joe ) , she said to me : " Lacy , I might have done better to marry some plain man . Like Jim Higgins . He would have been so grateful , and I should have known every minute where he was . " She smiled . " Of course when we had company he would have come in and squatted in the parlor . How droll it would have been ! " Droll indeed ; but I still wonder whether she was not right . For it was impossible to communicate with the Posey family : like children playing a game , they had their lingers perpetually crossed  --  which permitted them to do what they pleased . I have never been able to understand how any man can be a lawyer , for the law , assuming that people act upon motives , is rational ; but people never act for a reason , even a bad reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew . Did he seem reasonable to George ? George thought him willful and arbitrary because he , George , did not recognize the assumptions of the game . Papa 's feeling about Negroes seemed to George foolishand sentimental . But then George was a man who receivedthe shock of the world at the end of his nerves . As to all unprotected persons , death was horrible to him ; therefore he faced it in its aspect of greatest horror  --  the corrupt body . And it is likely that he hated money too ; therefore he spent all his time making it . There is no doubt that he loved Susan too much ; by that I mean he was too personal , and with his exacerbated nerves he was constantly receiving impressions out of the chasm that yawns beneath lovers ; therefore he must have had a secret brutality for her when they were alone .

In the square I saw a company of soldiers dressed it i Scotch kilts : they were lolling about in the worn grass , smoking and chewing , a few in close huddles playing cards , their muskets stacked along the sidewalk in a bristling row . I gazed stupidly at the gaudy tartans above the knobby legs and before I knew it I was angry . These men ai n't Scotchmen , I said ; I 'm a Scot and they 're my enemies . I paused at the corner of Congress Street by a group of card players and saw on their collars in gold embroidery , 79th New York . The cheap Glengarry bonnets set off the hard , foreign faces . One man looked me over as I passed , and I thought : I am a foreigner to him . But here are " our people , " I said , thinking of poor papa who had , I was sure , made a stern ceremony of disowning his son . I hurried along to High Street and turned to the right past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vista , from which the Posey house was only about five blocks ; but instead of going out Vista I kept to High Street , looking leftwards at the sun , which was still high , and I said : it could n't be more than three o'clock . In ten minutes I had reached the Seventh Street Road , where I turned west and after two blocks I had open ground and woods on both sides , rough land fenced into small fields . The road was rising all the time ; the ground to the north was still higher . I came over a little hill . A middle-aged Negro man sat on a rail fence smoking a pipe ; behind him his mule , still hitched to the plow , was tied to a rail . The darky uncrossed his legs and stood before me . " Good evening , " I said . I looked around but there was not a house in sight . " Whose land is this ? " I said . " It ai n't nobody 's . " He spat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture . He glared at me . " It ai n't nobody 's . It 's mine , that 's whose . I 's free . I 's freeborn . " He waved his pipe in the air , and gave me a sly look . " Is you seecesh ? " he said . " You talks lak it . " I turned my back on him , and crossed the road , and as I put a leg over the fence I called back , " Yes , I 'm seecesh . " I jumped to the ground and started up the hill to the woods . I do n't know why , but I found myself turningp189round to look at the Negro again . I shouted , " Yes , God damn you , I am . " At the top of the hill I came to a rocky ledge upon which grew a few stunted cedars . Down the slope ahead of me I saw tall sycamores , and in the quiet air I heard running water : the creek emptying into the canal above the college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to a clearing that revealed a little to the east the white dots of Holyrood Cemetery . To the north and west I got a long view over rolling fields that led to a brick mansion on a still higher hill : it was about a half-mile away and I suddenly recognized it  --  the house of Mr. James Kengla , " Cousin James " to the Poseys , who had been thrown into the Old Capitol Prison a few weeks ago . I broke into a dogtrot and I arrivedwinded at the last fence which I took at a vault ; then I leaned against it to rest . I got my bearings : if I had stayed on High Street until it became the Tennallytownroad I should have reached the entrance to the Kengla place that way . As I began the last ascent to the house I saw flying back of it the Union flag , and a little below it on a big flat rock a group of blue men looking eastward through field-glasses and waving red-and-white flags . Fifty yards from the house ran a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the signal station . I thought I had better go to the house and see who was there and tell them who I was . I went through a gate iii the hedge and had gone only a few steps when a harsh voice said : " Hey , boy , where you think you 're goin ' ? " A soldier scrambled to his feet and raised his musket , with fixed bayonet ; he was dressed in rusty blue and on his cap were the simple letters US . The Regulars , I thought , looking him over , not those foreigners from New York ;  |p190then  looking down the barrel of his musket , I knew that he was an enemy too . I kept looking at him , backing away towards the house . " Did n't I say halt ? " He cocked the musket . " No , " I said . " You said where 'm I goin ' . " He set his lips , uncocked his musket , and seized me by the sleeve of my jacket , pushing me ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're goin ' to see the colonel , " he said . When we came to the side of the enormous flat rock the top of which stood about twenty feet above us , the soldier prodded me in the butt with his bayonet . " Shinny up there , " he said . I turned on him . " Yes , God damn it , I am , " I said . He was startled . " What you say ? " I shinnied up the rock , he followed me , and we stood before a handsome officer in blue who held his fieldglassesin his hand . A sergeant was still waving the signal flags though the sun was rapidly setting , and I wondered how the other station , wherever it was , could read the messages . The colonel had not looked at me . He spoke to the sentry . " What do you want ? " The sentry stood at attention . " This boy was prowling around . Here he is , sir . " The colonel eyed me . " Well , son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , sir , " I said . " Where do you live ? " he asked . I was suddenly scared . " Langton 's Cross Roads , sir . " He laughed . " My man , " he began to the sentry , but broke off and looked at me again . " Langton 's Cross Roads . Is that across the river ? " I nodded . " What 's your name ? " he said . " Lacy Buchan , sir . "  | " My God , boy ! " He laughed again . " I thought I knew about Langton 's Cross Roads . " He hesitated , then spoke in a quiet voice . " Your brother , Captain Buchan , he 's  --  " he hesitated again : " He was a friend of mine . " He raised his glasses and said , " Here , take them . Your brother may be over there . " He pointed to the south across the river . I raised the glasses and looked . I saw first the white columns of Arlington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trees above the house . ' ( ' hen I felt a shiver , and my hand shook . The glasses were so powerful that I could see the scarred places on a tall evergreen by the house , scars where the branches had been cut off making the trunk a slender pole : at the top , flappingagainst the pole , hung the same flag that flew from the roof of the Marshall House , red and white with the big star in the field of blue . " Your brother may be there , " the colonel said . He took the glasses . " That flag went up an hour ago . That 's what we 're signaling . " He studied the flag again , then spoke to inc . " If they 've got five thousand men they can walk across that bridge  --  and who 's to stop them ? " I looked at the bridge , the Long Bridge that I had crossed so many times : I saw a long line of gray soldiers on it moving rapidly into the city ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with the naked eye I saw a lone army wagon parked , without its team , in the middle of the bridge . I turned to the colonel . " I better be going , " I said . " Young man , I suppose you are all right . " He pursed his lips . " What are you doing on this side ? " " I 'm staying with my married sister in Georgetown , sir . " He came forward and took off his gauntlet . We shook hands . " Keep on staying there , my boy , till this "  --  he made sweeping gesture  --  " is over . "  |p192I  followed the gesture : from the Long Bridge it seemed but a step to the housetops of Alexandria . The Washingtonmonument , only half done , rose in the foreground out of a sea of tents , I had almost said tombstones , they were so like the distant dots that I had glimpsed in Holyrood . Farther to the left Pennsylvania Avenue ran like a ribbon to the remote Capitol , towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My eyes drifted off into a scene of terror soon to be taken by the twilight . I would have stood there , rapt , forever . From below , from out of the white sea of the Federal army , came the weak , lingering notes of a bugle . The whine was taken up by another , then another , till the air was rent with brass : not a hundred yards away , under the brow of the hill , the sharp cry of a bugle brought me to myself . I turned to the colonel . " It 's supper time , " he said . I moved to the place where I had ascended the rock . The sentry had gone . I slid down on the seat of my trousers , ran round the back of the house into the lane , and by the time I had gone the half-mile to the Tenallytown Road , it was dark . Yes , God damn it , I am , I said , and I mumbled it over again . But first I 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . Christmas day in the morning , I said to myself as my heavy bootsoles clumped upon the hard turnpike . It was ten o'clock in the morning of May 7th : I know that because it was the day after the Confederate flag went up at Arlington , and the books agree that it went up on the 6th . I came out of the parlor to wait for Jane , and when she too came into the hall I started to open the front door but she said , " Wait a minute , I 'll be rightp193hack , " and tripped up the stairs . I said , " I 'll wait for you n outside . " The sunlight blinded me as I shuffled down the stone steps and went to the edge of the walk to lean against the big elm . The facade of the house was in the shade . I scanned the stonework of the first storey ; as my eyes came back to the door I wondered why the house had been begunwith stone and finished with brick from the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Posey had done it . But it did n't make any difference and I found myself adding , what they did  --  it does n't make any difference . The door opened , and Jane came out on the stone landing , shading here eyes . As she stood there I tried to guess which steps she would come down  --  the steps on the lower side pointing towards Fayette Street and the convent , or the upper steps near the elm tree . She came down the steps towards me , her white fingers showing through the , mitts and touching the curved iron balustrade . I stiffened as she reached the sidewalk . She stood before me as if she did n't know what to do next , with the helpless and already womanly reliance upon the nearest man , to whose will she had yielded her own . I took from her hand the music roll , and my hand tingled . She did not move . I said , as if somebody else were saying it : " Let 's go the long way "  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised her eyes , blue and shining , to my eyes . Her color deepened . I touched her elbow with the tips of my lingers , and gave her a gentle push , but as we began walkingI could n't keep her step : her little red boots moved inches at a time , like a bird . We came to the corner of Lingans Street by the schoolhouseand were about to cross over when she stopped , one loot on the curb , and turned with a glow in her face towards the river . I looked too : the wooded Virginia hills lay green before us and the great river stretched for miles to the west . I could see the flag over Arlington . The air was quiet ; there was no motion in the leaves above us ; there was nobody in sight . I was standing in the gutter ; she took a step backward up to the sidewalk and her eyes were higher than mine as she looked placidly but with the glow still in her face out upon the river and the Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazed at something in the distant blue . " I love it , " she said . I turned my head and pretended to follow her gaze . I said : " I love it too . " I do not know how long we stood there but it seemed very long because I knew what was coming . I stepped up to her side but kept looking into the distance . I said , " Jane , I love you . " I thought that she had not heard me and I felt a little relieved , but she at last dropped her eyes and touched my arm . " Lacy , " she said and that was all . She stepped off the curb and I fell in with her and almost instantly we had turned the next corner and were walking rapidly up the street . The high , damp wall of the college ran with us the three blocks to the convent wall , where we turned again , to the right , and came up before the dark , cool entrance to the convent . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped back again . A Negro maid opened the door . I handed Jane the music roll and she walked up the steps , but before she went in she turned her face to me and gave me , her lips parted and her eyes bright , a long and wondering stare . She went in and the maid closed the door . Too late , I continued to return her gaze , but there was satisfaction in it because now , alone , I could linger uponp195it and see in it all that I myself felt . I wanted to lie down upon the place at the door where Jane had stood . I heard footsteps nearby and I knew that they had been sounding all the time . I adjusted my cap to my head , and faced the walker who paced in a blue uniform with a musket on his shoulder , across the street . He was just a boy , hardly older than I , with a long bony face and small eyes . " Howdoo , " he said , pleasantly . I glared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't no war . I ai n't even seen no rebels . " He chopped the butt of his musket to the ground , and took out of his blouse some stringy tobacco . " I promised ma I would n't smoke but I did n't say nothin ' about chawin ' . " Ile sucked the tobacco into a quid in the corner of his mouth . " I seen you with your girl , " he said . " I got a girl at Parker 's Four Corners . That 's in Connettycut . " I advanced a couple of paces . " The hell you say , " I shouted at him . Then I said in a low voice : " You 're looking at one right now  --  you 're looking at a rebel . " " Well , well , " he said , pleased . " Well , well , " I mocked him . " Why n't you go back to that gal , you meddling Yankee ! " He looked bewildered , and shouldering his musket started down the street , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plaintive , " I ai n't doing nobody any harm . " I hated the way he said har-r-r-m , and then I thought of papa who was too noble to hate anybody for the way he talked or the place he lived , but I considered how being papa 's son made me what I was and that made me hate that boy . In a fury I ran along the convent wall until I i aine to the college gate where I sat down on a bench to wait until the college clock struck eleven . There is n't anyp196hope , I said to myself , and I saw in the mind 's eye the hordes swarming over mountain and field like ants on a soft ant-hill . An aged priest , in cassock and a flat-crowned black hat with an immense brim , came through the gate and seeing me , paused . I rose and bowed , taking off my cap ; he raised his hat and said , " God bless you , my son . " His face was contorted with age and pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearer to me to make way for somebody I could not see . A squad of eight boys in blue uniform , two abreast , marched through the gate flyinga small Union flag . The old gentleman watched them impassively until I saw him recoil and throw his hand up before his face . At the same instant a piece of rock hit me in the chest , and I saw several heads peering over the collegewall  --  young faces like the faces of the soldiers  --  and a harsh yell , more like a jeer , followed . The boys in uniform marched down Second Street . The old priest nodded his head sorrowfully and went back into the grounds . I suddenly said , " It 's coming . " In a few seconds the clock began to strike and I counted eleven . I ran fast to Third Street , turned the corner , and ran two blocks to the convent . The street was deserted . The sentry had gone . I fixed my eyes upon the door , and waited , and then I counted first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over again up to five hundred , but Jane did not appear . The tall , heavy oaken doors might never open again : was I sure they had ever opened ? I thought of the nuns whose vows forbade them to speak again , other nuns whose takingof the veil sealed their lips forever from conversation with men . But these must have been fallen women , I thought , in Protestant ignorance of the mysterious Church that never changed for peace or war . I said simply : Jane is late . The door opened but no one came out , only the spread/ing wimple of a nun appearing dimly in the hall . At last bane 's back appeared in the door , and over her head I saw the nun 's face , pretty and smiling . Jane backed away with a curtsy , turned and came down the steps , the nun smilingbenignly until Jane handed me her music and we started down Fayette Street , the nearer way home . I turned awkwardly and raised the bill of my cap . The nun closed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane . I tried to adjust my steps to hers but gave it up . I looked at her slyly . Her face and eyes were suffused with a marvelouslight . She tapped her feet or I should have thought she was not touching the sidewalk . She laughed and becameshy again . She stopped and faced me . " Lacy , will you write to me ? Sister will let me write to you , I know she will . " I said , " Yes , Jane , I will write , but we do n't need to write . I am here . " " Yes . You 're here . " She began walking again , the shy look in her face . " We 're both here , " I said . We came to the corner of Vista : it was only half a block to the house . We lingered at the corner . " Here we are , " I said . " Yes , here we both are . " The sun was hot , so I moved under a Sycamore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come in under the shade ? " Her voice was sweet and absent . She was looking again out over the river , and I wanted to touch the curl that hung from under the white poke-bonnet . " Under the shade , here ? " Then she looked at me and moved to my side . " What is the flag over there ? " And she raised her face towards the Virginia shore . " That 's the  --  well , it 's just the flag . "  | " Lacy , what is the war ? " A little frown appeared under her bonnet . " Are you going to be in it ? " " I do n't know , " I said . Then I looked at her : " Yes  --  maybe . " " Has it begun ? Tell me about it . " " It 's begun but there 's nobody been killed . " I could n't believe she knew so little . I said , " Not yet . " " Uncle Jarman said they wo n't fight . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it 's mentioned . Sister wo n't talk about it . And Aunt Milly just says , Thank you , honey , ' when I take her bananas up to her , and closes her door . " She frowned again . " Lacy , tell me about dead people . " I put my hands into my pockets and looked at the ground . In a flash I was standing in the parlor at Pleasant Hill by a little girl with violets in her hand , but I could not see her . A green leaf fluttered from the high tree and brushed Jane 's shoulder , then curved to the sidewalk . She clapped her hands , bent over and picked up the leaf and gave it to me . " Lacy , " she said gaily , " let 's not go in . Let 's stay out here . " " Let 's not go in , " I said . We started walking towards the house , silent , and we went by it and had to turn back . We went up the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we went into the hall , the door swung to , and we were in the dark . I took her hand and drew her to me and kissed her . When it was over I could see because my eyes had got used to the dark . I dropped the music roll upon the table and watched Jane as she fled up the stairs  |p201I  lay in the dark trying to decide what time it was and what had wakened me and how long I had been asleep before . There 's not a doubt in the world , I know what I am talking about , there is no way to get around it , I said ; Sister never mentions Semmes but she gets letters from him and she does n't want him to see Jane and she lets me see her even beyond propriety because she thinks it 's puppy love and anyhow I ca n't marry her because I am only a boy . Well , it was only Mr. Jarman upstairs who had wakened me , walking up and down , he may be thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reciting his compositions . But as I listened I heard no steps . The college clock struck three . There were voices below , in the garden or maybe back in the stable court . I got up and went to the back window and leaned over the sill . There were no voices now but I saw two men come from the stable towards the house . They stopped almost directly under my window . " Who 's that ? " I said in a low voice . One of the men moved swiftly against the wall of the house where I could no longer see him . The other raised his head . " That you , Marse Lacy ? " he whispered . " Is you awake ? " It was Blind Joe . He moved uneasily on his bare feet . " Could you please sir come down hyar , sir ? " he whined.  | I made no reply but turned from the window and drew on my trousers and stuffed my nightshirt into them . I picked up my boots and went noiselessly out into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then down the short flight to the wicket and out into the garden . When I reached the corner of the house the two men were flat against the back wall in the deep black . I stooped to pull on my boots . As I rose the moon came from behind a cloud in her third quarter . Blind Joe stepped out into the light . He drew his open lips tight over his teeth in an evil grin . " Well ? " I said . The other man came forward and drew himself to his full height , placing his hands on his hips . His back was to the moon , and at first I could n't see his face . " You knows me all right , young marster , " he said . The voice startled me and I advanced to examine his face : his head was thrown back and he looked down at me . The voice still echoed in my ears , and I crazily thought of Brother George and how he threw his head back in that arrogant tilt . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth fell open . " Yellow Jim ! " I said . I fell back a step and stared at him . " I come home , " he said in a whisper . I was bewildered and I said nothing , staring at Yellow Jim impotently , until it seemed that the moonlight washed all the Negro out of his face and he was a white man , and a white man too who had a right to be where he was . " I 'm glad to see you , Yellow Jim , " I said aimlessly . He did n't move . " Maybe de young marster will come to de stable , " he said . He nodded his head and seemed to stand aside for me to lead the way , but I was still rooted in amazement . He moved back into the shadow of the house ,  |p203followed  by Blind Joe , and I walked as quietly as I could to the stable door , and went in . The Negro men came in after me . At the far end of the stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beam in the low ceiling . The carriagehorses were still , but near us Queen Susie was nudgingagainst her manger ; she whinnied and gave the , back of her stall a vicious kick . That mare needs exercise , I said . She suddenly put her head out over the gate of the stall , and looked us over . Yellow Jim , who in the lantern light looked Negro again , stared back at her : in his excited face there was both recognition and fear . He took a step and put his hand on Queen Susie 's nose . It quieted her . " Hit 's been three years since me and this mar ' swapped places . " Of course I had n't known Yellow Jim before , had seen him once the day of the tournament , but there was a note of self-pity in his voice that embarrassed me . " Jim , " I ' said severely , " why did you run off ? " He looked at me humbly , but from his open mouth no words came . " Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you back . " He straightened up and looked over at Blind Joe who was shifting from one foot to another and giving forth low cackling sounds of delight . I said , " Shut up , Joe , " and he retreated a few steps into the background . Yellow Jim now looked at me and in the compressed lips and in the eyes that glared intensely I thought I saw something like menace . Instantly it passed , and he was his humble self again . " Jim , " I said , " why did you run off ? " He took a step forward and held his hand vaguely before him , as he had done by the roadside that day . " Young marster , " he said , " they ai n't no way for a man to change hisself into a field hand at my age . " He waited for me to speak but there was nothing that I could say . " De colonel , he go off to be in de war in Richmond , and de overseer  --  you remembers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he do n't lak me nohow , so he put me in de field and I say , What fer you put me in de field when I been in de house ? ' and he give me nine lashes . " He began tugging at his shirt-tail as if he were about to show me the lashes . I turned to Blind Joe . " You fix Jim a bed somewhere . " I walked towards the door and , pausing , spoke over my shoulder . " It 's late . I 'll see about you tomorrow , Jim . " I started across the paved court . With a swift glide Yellow Jim was at my side . " Please , young marster , you ai n't goin ' to send me back , is you ? " He spoke in a low wheedling tone . But I could not be severe with him . " Yellow Jim , you know I have n't anything to do with it . " I spoke kindly . " Good night , Yellow Jim . " " Good night , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now the moon had gone undera cloud and I had to hold my hand before me when I came to the corner of the house , and feel along the wall for the wicket . I took off my shoes , and opening the wicket went swiftly up the stairs . Susan said to let him stay for the time being , but I went next day up to the town hall to see the marshal , who said he was perfectly willing to take charge of Jim until he could deliver him to his master , but he did n't know when that would be , in the present state of the country . So YellowJim settled down " at home . " He went upstairs on the second day to pay his respects to Ole Miss , and before he had left her presence , Aunt Jane Anne had forgotten that he had ever been away , giving him petty orders and cau/tioning him to be careful with her " good glassware "  --  which , of course , had long ago been broken by the trifling Negro girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ran at all : they had their own way because nobody but Susan gave enough attention to the practical affairs of living to think them through . Old Atha , Aunt Jane Anne 's maid who had let me in the first night I was there , also did the cooking , what little there was , and supervised the two house-girls . If I asked for anything , or even if Susan did , old Atha would say : " Naw 'm , we ca n't do that , I ai n't heard of doin ' no sich thing since I 's born . " But with Yellow Jim it was different : he put on a white summer coat and moved around the house an eager specter looking for things to do . He cleaned my boots and brushed my clothes and toted upstairs the warm water for my bath . Except for old Coriolanus I think he was the best Negro I ever saw ; he was the most refined Negro , a gentleman in every instinct . But he was a Negro , and I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was if his white blood , which everybody knew about , had not been good . But since there is difference of opinion on this question , I had better say that white blood may have ruined poor Yellow Jim in the end . He knew what his blood was and he had many of the feelings of a white man that he could never express . He had conscience and pride , and no man , whateverhis hue may be , can have more . He had never , so far as I had been able to learn , committed a single breach of conduct . I will never forget to my dying day what he said to Coriolanus . " I say , Marster , what I done ? ' He say , You ai n't done nothin , ' you liquid capital , I got to have money . ' " Ninety-nine out of a hundred Negro men would have taken it as a matter of course , and gone their way to the new master . But Yellow Jim was humiliated ; worse than that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I should have felt : suppose papa were dead , and Brother Semmes had acted towards me in some grievous way , as if I were not a brother or even a member of the family ? YellowJim had been in the full sense a member of the Posey family , and the peculiarity of his situation as a slave had in no wise diminished his loyalty or even his complete participation in the family life : it had rather intensified it . I suppose Yellow Jim was with us a little more than a week . All that time Blind Joe tormented him . " Free Nigger now , ai n't you ? " Every day he would say to him , " Marster come home tonight , " and the evil grin spread over his face . I had been making Blind Joe take the mare out for exercise at least once a day and late one afternoon I heard an altercation between Yellow Jim and Blind Joe down in the stable court . I had only to look out of my window to see and hear it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe kept hollering out that the girth was too tight  --  " That mar ' 11 th'ow me shore . " Yellow Jim stepped up to loosen the girth , and Queen Susie threw her head around and bit him savagely on the forearm . Jim recoiled and held the place with his hand , backing swiftly towards the stable ; he emerged with a heavy buggy whip and gave the mare a merciless beating . He quit only when he was out of breath . He tossed the whip to one side and stood , his hands on his hips , glaring at her . Blind Joe mounted her and rode out through the carriage gate . Yellow Jim had broken a " rule , " but it was n't that that made me uneasy . When Blind Joe disappeared , Jim looked about him stealthily , moving at last with a sidelong gait towards the house ; I heard the door into the winter kitchen , which was in the cellar , slam after him . The mouth , thin and sensitive , was tortured , the shouldersp207humped : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had received the beating . That ought to have been ominous but was not : omens are those signals of futurity that we recognize when the future has already slid into the past . I have not described the special veneration in which Yellow Jim held the character of " Miss Jane . " Jane 's nurse , who had also been Brother George 's nurse , had died when Jane was only eight or nine years old . Yellow Jim practically became the child 's nurse . He was her groom when she rode abroad on her pony ; he rode with her , a half day 's journey , down to the Posey farm in Charles ; he was her escort to school , early Mass , and confession . When Jane received from the Sisters a medal for progress in French , music , or drawing , although the " medal " was only a small pewter image of Our Lord or Our Lady , Yellow Jim talked about it for days . " Ai n't nobody lak our Jane , " he would say . " Smartest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was back and Jane in the interval had become Miss Jane , he was as zealous as ever in his devoted service . I suppose in the desperation of his uncertaintyhe was compelled to assume the old security of affection in Jane : he needed it . But it was not there . The three years of absence had marked , as it would mark in the life of any child , the sudden change from childhood to maturity . Unless the objects of childish affection are present at that time and , lingering into the new life , are transformed , they are lost , or become strange , as if they had belonged to another world . Yellow Jim had become a stranger to Jane . I do not think that he quite understood this : how could he ? We were now in the third week of May : Jim , as I say , had been with us nearly a week : Jane and I had come backp208from our morning walk to the convent . Before I could open the front door Yellow Jim pulled it open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his " Good mornin ' , Miss Jane " a self-consciousness that I had not seen before . The specter-like ease of his movements had an intensity that I have never detected in any other Negro . Jane had answered his good-morning pleasantly enough , but she drew back when he reached out to take the music roll , her light cloak , and her bonnet . She handed them to me instead , and I , embarrassed , handed them to Yellow Jim , whose eye met mine on its return from a swift glance at Jane . He lowered his eyes and backed away as we went into the parlor . There was a chill in the room remarkable at that season , but there was no fire . Jane walked to the window . I was about to sit down but I took a step towards her . " Are you cold ? " I said . She came away from the window and sat down at the harpsicord , then turned to me . I could see her hands trembling . I knew better than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had dropped back into the shyness of youth , a ritual of prudence , I had almost said decency , that very young people cling to with greater fastidiousness than the old . At least that was the way I saw it , the way I acted upon Jane 's reticent withdrawal which to me seemed to say : the time has not yet come . . . . Her hand shook and her lip quivered , as she spoke . " I 'm not cold . " I thought she would weep . She looked into my eyes . " I am afraid of that man , " she said . I was at first bewildered , then scared . It was almost as if she had feared something that did not exist , a ghost , or perhaps a presence in the room that I could not feel . " What man ? " I whispered . " Why , " she said with amazement , " why , Yellow Jim . " At my back I heard a tinkle of glass , and was about top209turn my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigid on the edge of the small , scrolled chair , her eyes wideopenand opaque with horror . I turned to look over my shoulder . Yellow Jim advanced into the room with a waiter upon which stood two tall glasses . He kept his eyes fixed upon the waiter which he set down with a remark made in a thin voice . " Hit 's most too cold for sangaree but hyar ' t is . " Without removing his eyes from the waiter that now rested upon the table near the front window , he backed out of the room . I did n't see him again for more than a day  --  thirty-six hours exactly : he stayed away in the quartersand I did n't send for him because nobody could have sent for him . Nobody sent for a Negro under such circumstances . It is futile for me to wish that I had : it could no more have occurred to me than it could have occurredto me to wish that I were a Yankee . When Yellow Jim 's retreating steps no longer sounded iii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had not moved : the same horrible opacity filmed the liquid blue eyes . " Jane ! " I said , and it brought her to . Still frightened , she said , " I 'm afraid of him , I do n't know why I am afraid of him . " She contracted her brows . " He 's always handing me things ! " She rose abruptly to her feet and ran out of the room and up the front stairs . The next day it rained and I stayed indoors all day , not seeing Jane the whole time and not yet thinking it remarkablethat Yellow Jim had not appeared . Once I got out my mackintosh and actually put it on to start for thep210city to see what was going on in the camps of the Union soldiers , who were daily increasing by thousands till like a flight of locusts they had covered all the lower end of town ; but it was too wet , and I gave it up for one of the tales of Captain Marryat that had drifted downstairs from Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English midshipman who received a memorable lesson in manners from his grandfather the earl . It was like Hamlet 's rebuke of Polonius for his discourtesy to the players : " Use them after your own honor and dignity . " It was hard to understand , at my age , for it seemed plain that a great many people had to be treated , not as you felt about yourself , but as they deserved . How could you decide what peopledeserved ? That was the trouble  --  you could n't decide . So you came to believe in honor and dignity for their own sake since all proper men knew what honor was and could recognize dignity ; but nobody knew what human nature was or could presume to mete out justice to others . I thought of papa down in the old house in Alexandria thinking of his honor , which he would if necessarymention , and acting upon his dignity which he did not know he had because he had it so perfectly . Men of honor and dignity  --  where are they now ? I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know that I am not one . The classical proverb should be revised : Non viri fortes post Agamemnon multi . Men of honor and dignity ! They did a great deal of injustice , but they alwaysknew where they stood because they thought more of their code than they did of themselves . Papa thought more of his honor than of any of us , but he did not know that he did , and not even Semmes , who had suffered from the logic of honor , would have seen it so . There was nothing personal about it , and it was adamant , but there was no personal resentment in Semmes , and no anger ; only a feel/ing like anguish , and uneasiness for papa 's own situation . That was what it came to , for Semmes , to be disowned . At four o'clock that day , May the twenty-first , I heard people talking below me . I went out into the hall and down to the second floor which I reached in time to see Semmes ' back at the threshold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the room , and the door was about to swing to . " Brother Semmes ! " I said in a voice too loud for that quiet hall . A door opened behind me but after so many times I no longer turned to see Miss Milly 's peeping face . Semmes waited with his hand on the tarnished brass knob , the light at his back keeping his face in shadow ; he wore a short , gray dressing-gown that I recognized as Brother George 's . When I came to him he took my hand and then pushed me into the room by the shoulders . He had not spoken . I was about to say , Why did you come and how ( lid you get here , when I saw sister standing over by the far front window gazing intensely down into the shady street . Semmes closed the door and we stood there , but Susan did not move ; the flicker of an eyelash acknowledged our presence but that was all . The sun came over the trees outside , it being afternoon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a streak of gold . A glance would have noted a woman in thought ; a second look discerned the lines of muscle in her cheek , and the rapid heave of her bosom revealed agitation . I looked at Semmes : his face , since I had last seen him , had grown lean , he was white about the mouth , and his drooping eyes stared in bewilderment . He walked over to the mantel , stood a second , and sat down in a chair . Sister turned . " How long have you been here ? " she said.  | " An hour , " he said , surprised . She gazed into his eyes as if she were trying to read them , then turned again to the window . " Are n't you glad to see me , sister ? " he said . She came away from the window and stood before him . " No ! " she said in a harsh tone . She walked back to the window , and a softer expression came into her eyes as she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I have n't heard from you in over a week , " he said . " Well , then , " she said . She thought about it a moment . " I told you not to come here . " She moved rapidly across the room to the door , seemed to listen , then came back to Semmes and sat down opposite him . Her pale face was flushed . " I wo n't have it  --  I will not have it , Semmes ! " She sat back in her chair and studied his face . I could not decidejust what it was that she would not have , but Semmes seemed to know ; he rose and paced the floor , his finger at the side of his nose , his humorous , humorless face twitching . At last Susan said , in a calm , almost indifferent tone , " Well , have you seen her ? " Semmes halted abruptly , looked at her , and began again his measured strides . " I 'm on my way to the Valley . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia , Jackson'sbrigade , at Harper 's Ferry . Doctors are scarce . " He looked slyly at sister . " John Langton was damned glad to get rid of me . He put up my name before I could volunteer . " He stopped and stared hard at sister . " He sent his regyards to George . " The stare turned into a hard smile that I had not seen in my brother 's face before . " Our George , " he said ; then , " Your George . " Susan dropped her hands into her lap . " Semmes ! " she said . " Semmes ! " he mocked her . He stood over her . " Semmes !  |p213Yes  , I 've seen her . That 's what I 've been doing for the last hour . I 've been with her . And she says yes  --  she says yes she will marry me . Tomorrow . " He became more matter-offact . " I will take her to Cousin Bruce Washburn 's in Charlestown . I can see her nearly every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression of triumph in his long face . The flush of a moment ago had subsided from Susan 's lace : her gaze into Semmes ' eyes was fascinated , almost charmed . " It 's indecent , " she said in a low , remote voice . " It 's indecent , " he repeated in his mocking tone . " It 's indecent , " he went on in a rising voice , " it 's indecent to take Jane away from this mad-house . You 're as mad as they are but you do n't know it . " He seemed suddenly to hear his own words . He came over to sister . " Forgive me , sister , " he said . If she had heard him , she gave no sign . " Why , she 's only a child . " She smiled weakly but there was a gleam of purpose in her eyes . " She 's as much in love with Lacy as she is with you . " She looked at me , and Semmes followed her glance . I had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood up , with the door in the corner of my eye ; but I moved to the foot of the bed and held to the tall post . Semmes ' eyes drooped , and I knew that the tension had left him . " Are you in love with Jane , Lacy ? " His tone was both inquiring and incredulous . I must have blushed , for my lace was hot and my hands cold . I kept listening , as if for another voice ; I suppose I was trying to hear what my answer would be . I did not intend to lie , but when I spoke , t he words were a lie that I see now may have hastened the enveloping destiny of all these people . I should have said , ties , I love Jane and I think she loves me ; and Semmes 14 would have hesitated , he might have delayed his purpose , and sister would then have withheld hers . I clung to the bedpost as sister , with parted lips , looked me eagerly in the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brother , " I said , " I ai n't in love with Jane . " I left the foot of the bed and went back and leaned against the counterpane . Susan lowered her face into her hands . Semmes addressed her . " Is it indecent ? I have everybody 's consent but yours . I have George 's , in this letter "  --  he took a folded sheet from his pocket and waved it vaguely , but Susan taking no notice of it , he thrust it back into his pocket  --  " and I 've got Aunt Jane Anne 's consent too . I went from Jane to her . Old Atha said to git away from hyar ' when I knocked at her door , but I put my foot on the threshold and spoke directly to Aunt Jane Anne . She let me come in . It took me ten minutes to get the talk away from her condition . ' I made the unavoidable mistake of asking after her health . Well , she said she 'd been poorly ever since ma 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He paused and moved a step towards her . " Is it indecent to take Jane away from such a mother ? She 'll indulge herself the rest of her life because just once she did something for somebody else , for somebody who was dead . And now after all this time , when we 've forgotten all about it , she kept harping on George 's grief over mama 's death  --  because it seemed he might have to think for a few hours about somebody else 's mother . " He paused with his mouth open ready to go on ; but he suddenly shut his mouth and sat down with a sigh . " Sister , I do n't understand you , " he said . " You said she gave her consent ? " sister asked . " Why , yes , she did . She said , Of course , my dear boy , ' and then she asked , When ? ' but before I could answer her she had forgotten all about it , and was asking Athap215when the priest , Father Monahan , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new lace cap , Atha , ' she said . And I excused myself . " He put his hands on his knees and leaned forward . " Sister , I am going to marry Jane . " She got up and went to the wardrobe between the win- ( low and the head of the bed . She opened the door and took out a black knitted shawl , throwing it round her shoulders . As she turned back to the room she stopped at t he window and looked out . She glanced at us and nodded her head towards the street . " There 's Jane now , " she said . " I wonder where she 's been . " She pursed her lips reprovingly , as she might have clone had Jane been present . Semmes was watching her intently , but she was oblivious of him , and I felt that I knew what Semmes was going to say . " That 's one reason why I 'm taking Jane away . " Still sister looked out of the window as if she were alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " Jane has been to special confession and to get Father 's special blessing and a waiver of the banns in this bad time . That 's why , " he said almost gaily , " Father Monahan 's late for pinochle ! " He got up and went towards the door but I beat him there , and stood at the open door with the knob in my hand . I felt that I could not get out of that room quickly enough . Susan apparently had not heard anything . But as Semmes came to the door he glanced towards Susan 's rigid figure , a frown contracting his brow in perplexity . Then Susan turned round suddenly and sat upon the bed , her feet thrown under her in the manner of a child . There was a smile on her face , secret and certain , and I thought she looked like a woman who had drawn a good hand at whist and waited impatiently to play the cards.  | 1 6 " Semmes , " she said in a tense but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever marry into the Posey family . " Although the tone was kind , there was a note in it that I had not heard from her , ever , and the astonished expression that gradually spread over Semmes ' face told me that he had never heard it . I backed into the hall . From downstairs I heard the rapid , soft cadences of the harpsicordin a familiar strain  --  Flee as a Bird  --  and the colorless , sweet voice of Jane rising above the mellow bass . Semmes heard it too , with a glance into the hall . He seized the doorknob , took a stride into the hall , and closed the door with a bang . " I did n't mean to do that , " he said to himself . " No , " I said listlessly . He went down the hall to the last door , Brother George 's dressing-room , and disappeared . I walked softly past Aunt Jane Anne 's and Miss Milly 's doors to the head of the stairs . Jane had come to a bravura passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I stood at the parlordoor waiting for the end . When it came she turned on the seat and gave me a happy smile . Her eyes were large , liquid , and blue , and she said , " Hello , Lacy . " " Hello , " I said . I went into the room and sat on the edge of a rickety gilt chair , and stared at my boots . " Are you going to marry Brother Semmes ? " I said , still fixing my boots . " Yes , " she said . " You wo n't mind , will you , Lacy ? I 'll still love you too  --  I love both of you . " She smiled . " I thought maybe you 'd marry me some time , " I said , and although I had not felt much of anything , the words made me pity myself , and I felt tears coming , but I suppressedthem . " Oh , but you did n't ask me . Semmes did  --  weeks ago , when he got into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low register , as if she feared being overheard . " Lacy , I ca n't stand it . I 'm afraid . I 'm afraid of everybody . Sister too . She gives me such strange looks ! " I could hardly believe what I heard : was this Jane , the child Jane , who in body only was a woman ? She was far beyond me now . I said , " I see , Jane . " Then there were footsteps in the hall . I rose in order to retreat  --  why , I do n't know ; but retreat was cut off by Susan who stood in the door . " Jane , " she said in a harsh tone . " Jane ! " She waited . Jane clasped her hands together . " Yes 'm , " she said . " Jane , you know you do n't practice your music in the evening . " She looked around . " Where 's your embroidery ? " Jane , her hands still clasped and her eyes meekly cast down , rose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her back was turned to me as she began to push the long needle through the cloth . I went by Susan into the hall , and ran up the stairs . At the top I leaned over the banister . Susan looked up at me with a smile of satisfaction . That smile frightened me . I turned away and ran to the backstairs , and up to my room where , throwing myself upon the bed , I waited for it to get dark . Whether Jane saw her mother later that day I am not sure , but I suppose she did see her , because one of the things that Jane kept repeating time and again , all night , was : " Mama did n't listen to me . Mama did n't listen to me , " but what it all meant was one of those mysteries that never come into the light . Perhaps Aunt Jane Anne ought to be blamed , but it would be like blaming a what-not or a piece of bric-a-brac . Doubtless we can not help judgingp218everybody a little , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge all the others and to fix nicely the degree of personalwithin the common frailty , until in the end the judgments add up to a pharisaical jumble of ifs and buts . But this story is not an effort to fix blame , any more than it is a record of triumphing virtues . It is not only possible , it is necessary to say : that man is dishonest , or this other man is an honest man , for in so saying we are not judging an action or blaming or praising him for it ; we are only distinguishing a quality of character . But if two honorable men kill each other  --  and it is possible for men of honor to kill without dishonor  --  and bring upon their families untoldsorrows and troubles , what have we then ? Who is to blame ? I believe that here towards the end of my story all that one can say justly is that some of us behaved a little better than the others ; but not much better . If Aunt Jane Anne had listened to Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; and I doubt if it would have done us any good to think better of Aunt Jane Anne . I have already said that I went upstairs to wait for it to get dark . Why I wanted the dark no one could remember after all this time . There are days when we consciously guide the flow of being towards the night , and our suspense is a kind of listening , as if the absence of light , when it comes , will be audible just because sight and touch are frustrated . Of course this is what we all know . But how many of us know that there are times when we passionately desire to hear the night ? And I think we do hear it : we hear it because our senses , not being mechanisms , actually perform the miracles of imagination that they themselves create : from our senses come the metaphors through which we know the world , and in turn our senses get knowledge of the world by means of figures of their own making . Nobodytoday , fifty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear it . To hear the night , and to crave its coming , one must have deep inside one 's secret being a vast metaphor controlling all the rest : a belief in the innate evil of man 's nature , and the need to face that evil , of which the symbol is the darkness , of which again the living image is man alone . Now that men can not be alone , they can not bear the dark , and they see themselves as innately good but betrayed by circumstances that render them pathetic . Perhaps some of the people in this story are to be pitied , but I can not pity them ; none of them was innately good . They were all , I think , capable of great good , but that is not the same thing as being good . I suppose I wanted the night to come so that I could face a new emotion , that no doubt meant that I was no longer a boy . Children never hate ; they only feel anger . Hate is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no conscious purpose . I knew as night came on that I hated my brother Semmes . There may be many ways of killing time  --  how accurate is the common phrase !  --  but I knew two of them : minute activity either monotonousor surprising , but if it be the latter you will have to be borne up by some powerful excitement ; or just lying on the bed and floating away into the stream of timeless images , and then suddenly you are aware of the secret feelingthat all the set concentration in the world would not have let you face . It must have been about eight o'clock when without a knock the door opened a narrow crack . There was enough light , on that south side of the house , for me to distinguish my brother 's face : he stepped barely over the threshold and leaned , unspeaking , against the jamb . How do I know what I should have felt had it been full daylight ? He was dim , and only the configuration of person would have let me at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it was he , and I knew he was a stranger whom I hated for the sacrificial lie that I had told . Is not a noble liar God 's own scourge ? He is alwaysbelieved , and his genuine disinterestedness , his repudiation of self , seems to render him exempt from all responsibility : was not his intention good ? I knew that I hated Semmes , and if I had known as much as I knew a day later I should have known that my hatred was a kind of fear . My lie committed Semmes to full participation in the events directly to come . We are like children playing drop-the-handkerchief ; the conventions make the emotions that we are willing to die for , as children eagerly run themselves to exhaustion round a ring . He stood more than a minute in the door , then closed it behind him and came , softly in carpet slippers , over to the bureau where , striking a match on his slipper and watching the oily purple flame change to yellow , he lit a candle and gazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked as if he had been working problems in trigonometry . Without changing his posture he turned his face to me . " You 'll get like Mr. Jarman if you keep on staying in the dark , " he said . I did not move or speak . I felt that if I ever addressed my brother again I should have to tell him that I had lied ; but no noble liar is noble enough to obviate the evil of his lie . He waits to confess it vindictively . He straightened up , and said in a formal tone , " The ceremony is set for four o'clock tomorrow . " There was not a breath of air in the room . The candle burnt with a straight , unwavering flame . Seconds passed . I did not answer . He backed towards the door . " It will be here , of course . " I wanted to ask him a question , and he knew that I did , for just as he reached the door he paused and raised his ( head inquiringly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Lacy , " he said . I raised myself on my elbows but did not turn my head . " Lacy , I ca n't be here tonight . " Yes , I thought , he ca n't be here tonight . He grasped the doorknoband said , " Yes , what about George ? He ca n't be here . He ca n't get here in time . " As he was about to close the door after him he said , " Lacy , Cousin John is right about George Posey . I see it now . Why is he away all the time ? I 've got to take Jane away from this . " I still said nothing , and then Semmes must have heard the thunder of his own soliloquy echoing in his ears . With a swift awkward motion he jerked the door to after him , and I heard the first two or three steps as he went down the stairs . I heard somebody talking downstairs ; I supposed it was Semmes and Susan ; and then silence , which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the night I could not guess , and I never knew . What difference does it make ? He was running a risk coming to Georgetown at all where he knew everybody and everybody knew that he was a rebel ; yet at that early stage of the conflict men passed to and fro between the lines with ease if they were cautious . But where was Brother George ? Where , indeed , was he ? Did sister know ? I was sure that Semmes Buchan knew perfectly well where he was , and his rhetorical question : Why is he away all the time ? made me feel , as I turned it over , hollow inside , and not a little glad that the candle still burned on the bureau . Semmes ' moral desertion , and there is no other word for it , of his friend and brother , somewhat thickened the darkness around me , and I fixed my eyes upon the candlelight in a mesmeric stare.  | I was not sleepy and I said , " I ca n't lie here forever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downstairswere persistent and unabashed and I recalled the long procession of silent evenings in that house . There would be talking for five or ten minutes , then doors would close , and silence for a while ; the voices rose again . I had nothing to do with anything in that house but I saw no way of getting out of it . It must have been midnight or later when at last the talking ceased , or rather I thought it had ceased , since the rhythm of its lapse and renewal had been followed by a long silence ; and going to the side window overlooking the garden I saw the blackness where had shone on the foliage a ray of light from a window in Jane 's room . It was so quiet I thought I heard water running over rocks , and I said , I must be getting sleepy after all . I pulled my jeans off over my boots , and started to unlace my boots but for some reason left them on . I walked on my toes to the bureau and taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on the floor , and dropped a few matches by it on the bare floor . Then I lay down on the counterpane , still hearing the running water after I closed my eyesSometimes when you think you are sleepy and are not , time races through you , and years that have never happenedperform a whole cycle of events more complete and satisfying than a lifetime of our beginnings that have no end . The water kept running and at last I saw it through the scrub pines down back of the farm where the lane from old Mr. Woodyard 's blacksmith shop drops sheer to the ford . Wolf Run ! Now that I could see the water I saw myself gazing at the riffle in late evening , as I squatted on a rock with my gun across my knees . It was one of those scenes without purpose that come to you complete : you dop223not know how you got there on the rock or where you are going , and then it is dark . Doubtless there is a little consciousdirection in these reveries because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be doing something , but I doubt if you ever want to hear anything . But that is what I did  --  I heard something , sitting there on the big rock , my gun , loaded , across my knees , and the clear , black water swirling round a log and falling on a shelf of rock a foot below . This , I said , with that double awareness that we sustain in reverie , is only a way of hearing the night , far off , a cry that the darkness makes , and I thought for an instant that it was only the water getting louder , or the water changing its tone , as if a flute had altered its timbre from lucid trickle to the whine of the hautboy . I saw myself looking up the opposite bank through the trees for the panther whose scream now came with the rhythm of breath , low on the intake but rising to a high wail with the heave of the expulsion . I touched my face and I was lying on the bed : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gunshot as I slid from the bed to the floor , fumbling for the matches that I could not find . I grabbed my jeans from the footboard , drew them on , and getting from the top bureau drawer a navy revolver , I went out into the hall to the head of the stairs . It was dark and silent . I was about to go back to my room when there was a step in the hall below , and I said , " What 's that ? " There was no answer . I listened . I could just distinguish the susurration of hard breathing , and I went rapidly down the dark , familiar stairs with the revolver held before me . In the hall , between the doors into Aunt Jane Anne 's and Aunt Milly 's rooms , I bumped against the small table . Reaching with my left hand for a match I lit the candle , and as the pale light filled the hall I saw crouching , at the head of the stairs , a man , his head lowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an expected blow . " Get up , " I said pointing the revolver at him . The man , his arms still over his face , pushed his back against the wall and slowly gained his feet . He dropped his hands to his sides and with a startled expression stared , not at me or at the pistol , but at the burning candle . I dropped the pistol to my side and took a step forward . " Yellow Jim ! " It was a whisper . His muddy eyes bulged and with effort he moved them to my face , but it was only a glance ; his head drooped and he began rubbing his leg nervously . " Put your face against the wall , " I said . " Hold your hands over your head . " He did it , and I looked up and down the hall . In the back hall the door into Jane 's room was ajar ; all the others were closed ; the silence was perfectfor even Yellow Jim was no longer breathing hard . " Stay where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Jane 's door and decided that she must be with sister ; so I turned to look up the front hall , and turning again to keep my eye on Yellow Jim I backed towards sister 's door , and still facingYellow Jim I tapped on her door , and waited . Yellow Jim had not moved : he might have been a dead man propped against the wall . As I waited , hearing no sound in sister 's room , I gazed at the Negro , thinking perhaps he had been sent for . But why had I found him crouching ? Why had he not answered me ? Then I shivered a little . Where had sister been , where was she when whoever it was screamed ? And where were they all now ? I began to shake all over and I tapped again on the door but before I finished it Aunt Jane Anne 's door opened acid sister came out into the hall . She stopped short , and frowning looked at the candlep225burning on the table . Then she saw Yellow Jim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only looked at him curiously as if the anomaly of his presence lay solely in his being propped to the wall . " Sister ! " I said . She was startled : she almost dropped her candlestick . As she recovered it midway to the floor , the candle went out , and the other candle threw her profile into silhouette ; her mouth was compressed into a hard line . Then she turned towards me . " She 's dead , " she said in a flat tone . " Well , " I said , as if I had been asked to fetch a glass of water . Then it came over me . " Dead ? " I echoed her . " I said she was dead . " Sister 's voice sounded almost legal , it was so controlled . " She died of fright . There 's not a bruise on her . " Her hair flowed down her back , gathered at her neck with a ribbon ; her white wadded silk gown was neatly folded about her waist . My God , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I said , " Who screamed ? " I advancedtowards her and the pistol caught her eye . " I suppose you 'll kill him , " she said . She looked at Jim . Then she fixed me with a purposive stare . " It was n't Aunt Milly , " she said . " She 's still asleep  --  took her sleepingdraught after the excitement of Jane 's betrothal . " She looked down the hall at Jane 's open door . " It would le Jane who screamed , " she said deductively . I walked past her towards Jane 's door . She followed and I looked at her over my shoulder . When she came to YellowJim she walked round him as far as she could , holding to the banister . She 's at least still human , I thought , as we stood at the door . She held her unlit candle . I searched my pockets and found a match and lit the candle . She made a gesture with her free hand ; I stepped back ;  | she walked steadily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the light discovered the room I discerned a white body lying on the floor about three feet from the foot of the bed . Jane lay on her back as if she had been stretched out , as if , too , some one had carefully drawn her white nightgown down over her limbs . Sister knelt by her , placingthe candle on the floor . The light suffused Jane 's face . The mouth was open . Her skin was tight and chalky , like pressed muslin . I thought it a shame that any girl should be lying there humiliated , so young . Sister looked up at me . " Jane is alive , " she said . She began to rub her cheeks and then to chafe her hands . She rose and went to the washstand and finding only a toothbrushholder of some pink flowered pattern ; she filled it from the pitcher and dashed the water into Jane 's face . The prone girl did not move . " Come here , Lacy , " sister said . I glanced up the hall at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went in and together we lifted Jane onto the bed . She was limp as a willow and light as cork . Sister looked her over , and at the same instant we saw that the left sleeve of her nightgown was torn . Sister bent over her and turned the sleeve back , disclosing four shallow scratches about an inch apart and an inch long . She had been clawed as she had drawn away . I gazed at them with infatuated eyes , until I felt my stomach heave and I knew that I was sick . Sister had stood back and now stared at the wounds with wide eyes , her lips closed so tight that the blood had left them . Jane 's head moved and as if in weakness fell over towards me , away from sister . She opened her eyes but I knew she saw nothing . " Mama would n't listen to me , " shep227said in a normal voice that brought me to . " Mama would n't listen , " she said . That was all I ever knew but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to know any more . Did n't I know what had happened ? I thought I did , and I still think what I then thought , which was what any man would have thought . I suppose Susan 's continued stare ought to have started a little doubt in my mind , had I been able to take it in , but nobody at that time could have seen in sister more than agitation and horror , emotions that certainly dominated me out of all observation . As we continued to look at the poor girl I knew that here at last was the night that followed the brilliant day in May when the gay party rode away from Pleasant Hill for the gentlemen'stilt in the west meadow of Henry Broadacre , Esq. , that rolled away into the distance green as the sea . I saw Brother George charging down the course , his lance perfectlybalanced ; only I saw him sadly astride , not Queen Susie , but the man Yellow Jim whose face was as white as his master 's . And they ran over a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was all over in a minute , and the tournament had been won . Suddenly I was holding the bedpost and puking on the carpet , but before it was done with I had recovered and was looking at Susan . It was too late for astonishment ; so I just watched her run her hands over the now consciousbut still immobile body of Jane . She ran her hand from the girl 's ankles up her legs to her thighs , and examinedcuriously the folds of the nightgown , till perplexitydulled her eyes , and she stood away . Then her face tightened , and she shifted her eyes in their sockets till they fixed me with a decisive glare . " Take him up the river , " she said . " But , sister , " I said , then stopped . She was looking atp228me . " Yes , sister , " I said . But as I backed towards the door where a few steps would bring me to Yellow Jim I was afraid , and the fear heightened my awareness of myself untilI felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought ; so I paused . I said in a low tone , " I 've got to get ready . " I advanced to the bed , and spoke across Jane . " I 'll just lock him up for a while . " Then the adventure seemed too bold . " Sister , " I pleaded , " ca n't I get help ? " " Help ? " she said , and she actually smiled briefly before she set her lips . It was the smile she had sent me from the lower hall . I could not even think of Yellow Jim at that instant . The smile had turned the world upside down . All that had happened up to that moment , even the old lady down the hall lying in death alone , could somehow come out of the life we lived ; but not that smile . There was no way to take it in , no sense in it ; it was like a herd of kangaroos asking to be taken as commonplace at PleasantHill farm . But looking at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sudden , remarkable purpose in Susan Posey who had undoubtedly felt for YellowJim something like pity as she had passed him in the hall . I suppose you 'll kill him  --  and it had been a little contemptuous of the usual violence of men . Now she commandedit . " It 'll have to be done tonight , " she said . I turned again , and I wondered if this time I should get out of that room . I did , and it was with relief that I saw Yellow Jim still standing as I had left him . " Come on , Jim , " I said . He turned around and tried to lower his arms but his face went taut with pain . An inch at a time he brought his arms down till his hands reached his shoulders , and I motioned him to the stairs . He looked bewildered , and then scared as he faced what he had to do . Still he hesitated.  | " Go on , " I said . He appealed to me with his eyes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scuse me , marster , " for even at that , for him , terrible moment , the ultimate fear of any Negro , he was aware that he was about to precede a white man . I took the candle from the hall table . He picked his way down the stairs as if each step might be different . We rance to the main hall and he knew which way to go  --  down the hall to the short flight of steps leading to the wicket . When he came to the steps he turned and gave me a look of mild surprise . I was not following him . I said , " Wait . " There were footsteps upstairs . Susan appeared at the upper banister and said in an ordinary tone , " Send Atha up . " I nodded . I went to Yellow Jim . He led the way out through the wicket into the garden , then round the corner of the house to the door into the winter kitchen . From there through pantries and storerooms we came to the little cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into which the only access was a massive oaken door all studded over with spikes . In the center of the door was a small , stoutly ironed grating . It was only a little old calaboose that Mr. Rozier Posey had built to put his had Negroes in . I held the candle to the door and turned the brass key . The door came open and Yellow Jim stepped over the threshold with a sort of briskness as he said , " Please , young marster , do n't leave Jim in de dark . " I handed him the candle . " Jim , " I said , " what made wit do it ? " He made a motion in front of him with his hand as if he were asking for silence . " Young marster , hit just come to me . Hit come to me and ' fore I knowed it I was up them stairs and openin' ' de door . I did n't mean to open de old mistis 's door . " He ran his hand through his coarse ,  |p230straight  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I just looked in de door , then shet it . Now de old mistis daid . " " It 's going to be bad for you , " I said . He looked at me humbly , then his eyes were wide with terror . " I did n't do nothin ' , I did n't mean to tech Miss Jane either . Hit was when she hollered . That 's when I done it . Hit come over me . " He gestured again , his palms extended as I had seen them by the roadside at the Court House . " I could n't do nothin ' lak that now , naw sir , young marster , ' fore God I could n't . Hit 's gone clean outen me . " He touched his face to see , I am certain , if it was he and he was there . " Seem lak I could n't do no good after I hearn Miss Jane say she 's afeared of me . " His tone had becomemanly and his posture erect . I gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell door , turning the key and putting it in my pocket , and found my way back to the kitchen in the dark . Fumbling at a shelf that I remembered in a corner , I found the stump of a candle , lit it , and went to a door leading to the other side of the basement . A narrow , smelly hall led a few steps to a door . I knocked . " Atha ! " I said . There was no sound , but presently I heard a bed creak and then low mutterings . " Who that ? " she said . " Miss Susie wants you , " I said . There was more mumbling , then : " Miss Susie ai n't never sent fer me , she ai n't sent fer me sence I 's born . " The door opened a crack . " G'long , " she said . " I reckon your mistis will be needing you , Atha  --  old mistis . " She rolled her ochreous eyeballs and said , " Yassir , " but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out through the door into the court . At the corner of the housep231the dark figure of a man blocked my way . I stepped back and raised the pistol . The candle went out . " Hit 's me , " a voice said . It was Blind Joe . But he still stood in my path . " Get out of my way , " I said in a low tone . He moved , and then there was a leer in his voice . " Youdone put him in de lockup , ai n't you , Marse Lacy ? " I was angry . " Go on where you belong , you blackbastard . " He said nothing for a minute but I heard a whining chuckle . " I belongs to go fer de doctor . I belongs to go fer de priest . Miss Susie said so . " " How 'd you know she wanted you ? " " Ai n't ole Marse Rozier say , Joe ai n't wuth a continental but lak de buzzards and de flies he 's everywhar ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where 's Marse George ? " It was pitch dark but I saw his mouth stretch before I heard again his low chuckle . " Marse Lacy , now you talkin ' , you shore talkie ' now . " He moved so near he could have touched me . " I git de marster  --  I git him before sun tomorrow . " " Get him , " I said . " Joe , you get him . " There was no answer . He disappeared on noiseless feet in the direction of the carriage entrance . I went round to the wicket and into the house . In the lower hall I stopped to light the stump , and in the light I said to myself , I 've got to have help . When I reached the foot of the stairs I paused to consider the darkness of the upper hall , and the silence that I thought should not have been there . The pistol was getting heavy in my right hand . I started to lay it on the table under old Jeremiah Gibson 's portrait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeans , andp232went up the stairs . Out of Jane 's room appeared old Atha , a candle in one hand and a basin of water in the other ; I knew she saw me but she kept her head averted . Her face looked like wet ashes and there was drool on her lips . That Negro , I thought , will never be insolent again . Then , as if I had always assumed that Madagascar lies off the coast of South America , but now realized that it lies off west Africa , I remembered that Yellow Jim was Atha 's son . She went into the back hall and down the back stairs . I got to get away from here , I said , or I 'll be seeing sister again . I went up the next flight but when I came to the door of my room I went on past it to the end of the hall where a steep flight of steps , inclosed in a narrow well , led to the fourth storey , and Mr. Jarman 's apartment . The steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to go up sideways , led abruptly to a door , without a landing . I knocked gently , but getting no response , lifted the latch and entered a low , narrow , dark hall , the ceiling of which sloped away on my right . On my left were two doors . I knocked at the nearest one , and prepared for a long wait . Almost instantly the door opened ; I was so astonishedthat I lost my tongue . " How do you do , sir , " said Mr. Jarman in the most beautiful human voice I had ever heard . He had greeted me as he would have saluted a friend at a horse race . I stared at him rudely . He backed away , opening the door for me to enter . A bright lamp was burning across the room , at his back ; I could not see his face . I continued to stare at him . " To what unusual amenity , " said he , " am I indebted for the honor of this visit ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I walked in and turned to look at him as he closed the door . " Mr. Jarman , " I said hoarsely but the old gentleman 's air , I suppose his innocence and urbanity , forbade anotherp233word . He came by me and paused a little uncertainly in the middle of the room . I glanced around . The lamp stood on a rough , unpainted table against the far wall . Under the lamp were heaped odds and ends of papers , big sheets of foolscap scribbled over , and dirty quill pens . At the far end of the table I saw a battered silver waiter piled high with eggshells , and over in the corner of the room stood , in a row , five large slopjars , the lid of each being covered with a network of intricate tatting . He looked about him apologetically . " This , " he said , " is my dormitory and my graphaecium . The lamp burns diurnally and nocturnally so that the progress of my labors will not be interrupted by the succession of days . Time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked at me through his steel-rimmed spectacles . " Have you read Triumph of Time by Shelley ? " Why had he got the title wrong ? I suppose he simply could n't let Life triumph ! " No , sir , " I said . " I have n't read it . " He looked disappointed . " Well , " he said amiably , " shall we go into the atelier ? " With studied politeness he walked before me to the door into the other room , which he opened , then stood aside for me to enter . An identical lamp burned on a large square table which was littered like the other table , only there were piles of books . The walls were lined with bookcases . There were four straight chairs , each placed at a corner of the room . With a wave of his hand he pointed to a chair . I sat down as he sat diagonally across from me . " Atelier , " he said with the French pronunciation : he had said ateleer before . " Alas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my contemporaries to whom I can speak FTench . His death , sir , is a loss that I feel more keenly with each passing year . " He leaned back meditatively in his chair . I observed the pallid face , the high bulging 34 forehead under the metallic white hair , the pale blue eyes that did not focus on anything , the thin , sensual mouth , the small determined chin and the lobeless ears : the nose was small and slightly turned up  --  which gave him an expression of perpetual surprise . He had a look of selfish intelligence that was distinctly heightened by his attire , which was absurdly elegant : frock coat , choker collar , and black satin cravat . " My late brother was not a scholarly man . But an able man , sir , a man of large interests . It was his munificence that to a great extent has made possible the leisure of my studies , although , of course , " he added , " our patrimony was comfortable . " He pursed his lips , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am now engagedupon a most interesting and illuminating work , the most ambitious work of the imagination , I do dare aver , of the nineteenth century . It is nothing less than a history of the struggle of man to build civilization upon the sterile wastes of the earth after the ice age . " He rose with the spring of a child , went to the table , and seized a huge scrinium from which he drew a rolled manuscript . He pulled his chair to the light , sat down , adjusted his spectacles , coughed slightly for the attention of his audience , and looked at me . " I shall read from the first chapter . My model has been Gibbon . " He scanned his manuscript with deliberation . I moved forward to the edge of my chair . " I ask you , sir , " he said , " to consider critically the opening sentence . It has , I have no doubt , what Dr. Johnson called the grandeur of generality . " He coughed again . " The skin-clad remnants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew to its tedious close . ' " He laid the manuscript in his lap . " Ah , how Custis would have liked it ! " He looked off into space , smiling his perfectsatisfaction with himself . " Death is indeed the sunderer , " he sighed  |p235I  almost fell out of the chair . I regained my seat , and looked at him . Death could n't be an old lady , his sisterin-law , downstairs ; death was the sunderer , or time , or our enemy . I gripped the arms of the chair . " Mr. Jarman ! " I shouted . " Ah , " he said , and glanced at me slyly . Then he gave me , over the rims of his spectacles , a long stare . He closed his mouth like a fish , hastily placed the manuscript upon the table , and settled back in his chair . " I see that it is young Mr. Buchan to whom I owe this pleasure . " I shouted again . " She 's dead ! " " Dead ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead  --  been dead these many years . As I say , a man of business . But we are of noble lineage and , I think it could be proved , of royal descent . You will understand that while my means ( f entertainment are limited by the habits of a man of letters , I wish to make your call as pleasant as possible . " l le smiled hospitably . " Your little niece , my grandniece , is descended from the Vyvyans of Shropshire , and through them from the Plantagenets . We count among our ancestorsPhilip the Third of France , Edward the Confessor , and the grandfather of George Washington . " He leaned forward in his chair . " I thought that this information would give you greater relish in our society . " I rose and stood uncertainly looking at the door . He was gazing at me with surprise . " I see that you are armed , " he said . " No doubt a necessary precaution in these times . The war . I assume that measures of pacification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good night , Mr. Jarman . " " Night ? " he said . He pulled out a big silver watch . " It is , indeed . Half-past-three . " He took up his manuscript , and was instantly alone . I left the door open as I wentp236out , and found my way down the difficult stairs . I had left my candle . When I reached the second floor there was a candle burning on the table , and there were voices soundingfrom Aunt Jane Anne 's room . I could not hear a word , but presently the door opened and Father Monahan followed by two nuns came out into the hall . He saw me and stopped , looking sharply at the pistol handle protruding from my jeans . As the nuns recededa few steps and began to whisper , he advanced and spoke in a low tone . " I know all about it , " he said . His sharp black eyes looked into my eyes . " I 've seen the Nigger Joe . You 've done the right thing . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He turned his head and gave the nuns a nod . They came forward and at the head of the stairs waited for the priest to lead the way . " That is the Mother Superior , " he said to me . One of the nuns turned and looked me fullthe face ; she looked at Father Monahan , who said , " The Mother Superior will come for the young lady at eleven o'clock . There 's no other way . The girl can never be the bride of any man . " I looked at the floor , saying to myself , Liar ! But I knew that Father Monahan was not the liar . As he passed me I saw heavy beads of sweat on his forehead . He looked at me , it was man to man . " I know you are not one of us , young man , " he said . " We 've got to keep life simple . That is a practical reason for saving the human soul . " He put his hand on my shoulder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed himself , and the nuns crossed themselves as they followed him down the stairs . How long Susan had been standing in the hall I do not know . There she was , at the end of the front hall , just out/mile her own door . To go up to my room I had to get to the stairs in the front hall , not more than ten feet from het . I pretended that I had not seen her . " Come here , Lacy , " she said in a dead voice . As I approached her she went to the threshold of her or , then turned to face me . " Where have you been ? " She was appealing to me under the harsh tone . I could not answer her . " Did you take tin up the river ? " she said . " No , sister . " I hung my head . With one step she backed into the room , seized the doorknob , and slammed the door in my face . I grabbed the butt of the pistol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the stairs . There was old Athain the hall outside her dead mistress ' door . The door wasStanding open . I could see at the foot of the bed a tall bundle burning , and a heap of white dresses hanging over e back of a chair . On a table opposite the door there as a pile of small pasteboard boxes , each tied with a ring from which dangled a small card : the knicknacks at the old lady for many years had put away in boxes and beled , so that she knew the contents of the boxes by tart , though once classified the beads and gloves andhandkerchiefs never appeared again . The walls of the were lined with chests and trunks , and unopened ekages covered the mantel-shelf . That room would never ange : nothing would happen in it , nobody was dead , nobody had ever lived . It must have taken all the life outof her to beat her husband when she had tripped him atthe top of the stairs . Old Atha put out her hand and touched me on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " There was a squint in one of her eyes . Her lip trembled . " In the cellar , " I said . I started up the stairs  | " Gawd bless you , marster , " she whined . As I went into my dark room I felt that I had been blessed too much , that I was a liar and a coward , and now , God knows , falling upon the bed without even putting the pistol down , I knew that I had achieved my full measure of darkness . When I closed my eyes I was sitting on a big rock listening to the water in the run , and again I heard the panther scream . I have n't slept a wink , I said , as aching in every bone I put my booted feet upon the floor and rose from the bed . I stared dully at the revolver lying on the floor . I tried to think how it had got there but gave it up and decided that I had slept a little because there were things I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light of sunrise . The first sun in the last week had struck the top middle pane of the east window ; now it came through the top panes of the lower sash and flooded the room . May the twentythird , eighteen-sixty-one , I said , and at least eleven o'clock in the morning . I went over to the washstand and cupping my hands reached into the pitcher ; I dashed the water over my face . Eleven o'clock in the morning , at eleven o'clock said the priest . I went to the window and looked diagonally across the court to the stable : the carriage door was closed . It is not eleven yet , I said , hearing a voice , Blind Joe 's , rasping in the light morning air . " Mistis , I did n't do no sich thing . " His tone became wheedling . " No-o-o , ma 'm , I ai n't seen him a-tall . " The voice was under my window , so I put my head out and looked down . There was Blind Joe facing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to me , talking to him in an undertone . There was something remark/able about her . I thought perhaps I had not seen her below , yet she wore no hat : a strange bare-headed woman , ht. ' hair almost white , was talking to a servant of that house , in the back yard . Then I understood it , but what I understood first I do not know ; whether I identified her and in that way underStoodthat Joe had been saying he had not seen his master , r %v Nether what he said could have been said to one pertitonly , to Sister Susan alone of all people under all the cicrumstances of that bright morning that had risen upon M- dark a night . Like the causal priority of the chicken or the egg , it could tease me into speculation forever . But there it was : Blind Joe and sister talking in the back yard. presently he went off towards the stable and sister came round the house . I heard the light tap of her feet on the brick walk leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image of her graying hair . I wiped my face , picked up the pistol and put it back into the bureau drawer , drew on my jacket , and went to the poor . I stood for a while holding the doorknob . I betterarc Yellow Jim , I said . In this house nobody will give him a drink of water . But what did I care about Yellow Jim ? I had to think of something to get myself down the stairs , and after you 've told one lie it makes little difference if you tell others , even to yourself ; and I went out into the hall and down the stairs . On the second floor the nuns were standing in the hall by the table , and I could hear people moving about in Jane 's room . I went quickly past the nuns , who gave no nigh of recognition , and was starting down the next flight of %lairs when I saw sister already halfway up . I retraced my tarps and stood just at the head of the stairs , waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I had been a lamp post , and looking straight ahead went into Jane 's room , leaving theP240door ajar , where I could hear her talking to Atha ; but if Jane was in there she was not talking . I went on down the stairs and back into the diningroom . It was a strange place : the long bare table , the black chairs lining the walls , the futile elegance of the ivory wainscoting . The intended brightness of the blue walls could never get enough light from the remote side windows . Nobody had ever eaten in that room . Yet there , across the table , was Jane 's place , and I heard myself saying : Will you have some gooseberry jam ? The narrow stairs down into the winter kitchen were by the dumb-waiter . I went down , and in the kitchen it was nearly as dark as night . On the table was Atha 's old candlestick with a good candle in it . I lit the candle and stood listening for a sound from the stable court , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the calaboose . It was dead-quiet : Jim is asleep , I thought . I took the key out of my jeans and unlocked the door , holding the candle before me . Jim was sitting on a three-legged stool , his back against the brick wall . He rose to his feet . " Sit down , " I said . He sat , trying to hold himself erect . " Marster , do n't let that Nigger Joe come here no more . " His eyes were half closed and he seemed to be talking to himself . " Do n't let him come no more . " He suddenly raised his head . " Is de marster comin ' ? " " I do n't know , " I said . " Jim , " I said in as kind a tone as I could , " it wo n't be Marse George . It 'll be Mister Semmes . " He seemed to hear me from a distance . " Marse Semmes , " he said . " Marse Semmes . " He looked up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do owe it to hisself . " Then apologetically : " Hit 's the Nigger in me . " The stump of candle , burnt to the wick end , lay on theP241floor . 1 handed him Atha 's candle . " Here , Jim , " I said . I gave him a few matches . If he had said it was the whiteplan in him I should have been able to take it in : I was dumbfounded . But I 've got to kill him , I said , without en giving him a chance ; I 've got to kill him to keep hones from killing him . My face was hot , and I was a litlequeasy in the stomach , but I felt pleased with myself . " Look here , Jim , " I said in a hollow voice , " it ai n't tits ' to be Mister Semmes . It 's got to be me . It 's my fault . " Ile dropped his hands to his sides and turned a dazed How face to me . His mouth fell open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sank back against the wall . I rued to go . I saw him from the corner of my eye sitting placidly with the candle in his hand . " You better lock de door , young marster , " he said . I stopped dead , turned awkwardly and seized the door , d without looking at Jim closed it with a thud , and turned the key . I put the key back into my pocket . ( : cling back to the kitchen I could see the dim light frome kitchen window , so I began to run , and it is well that ( lid , for I heard the trot of the horses in the court , and second later the slam of the carriage gate after the horses ad reached the street . I ran up the stairs into the diningroomand out into the hall , which was empty , but I slowedto a walk , and went tiptoe to the foot of the main stairway . The front door was open . The carriage was alreadydrawn up in front of the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top , not in his livery , but in a torn alpacacoat and felt hat which was crazily adorned with peacockfeathers . I went to the door . Blind Joe saw me instantly . He jumped off the box , and standing on thesidewalk put his face through the bars of the iron banister . " Marster , " he whispered . " Miss Jane take de veil . " HeP242showed his teeth like the cur that he was , and grinned . " Shut up , God damn you , " I said . " Get back on the box . " He did n't move . I moved nearer to him . " Why did you lie to Miss Susie this morning ? Why 'd you say you had n't seen Marse George ? " He tried to look solemn . " Marse Lacy . I ai n't told no lie to Miss Susie . I ai n't seen de marster . I sont him word . " As he turned away he said , " He be here tonight . " I went back into the hall in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs . The black crepe that she had on was the same that she had worn as mourningafter mother 's death : it just touched the edge of my mind that it was absurd to see anybody in black when the dead person had not been alive , and only the living were dead . At that instant she was a black object which acquiredhumanity only through the vehemence with which she moved that terrible white hair . Her face was bluewhitewithout any light in it , like the dining-room ceiling , and her eyes looked like scratched agates . She stood at the foot of the stairs with her hands clasped before her , looking out into the street . Without lowering her eyes she said in a casual tone , " In a few minutes I want you to let Jim out . Tell him to run away . " If I had not been able to see her I should have thought that she was a woman giving directions to a servant while her mind was on something else . " After the vows are taken she may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her out . Do you understand , Lacy ? " she said in a sweet tone . " After the final vows she ca n't get out at all . " She turned her hardened eyes upon me . " Do you understand ? " Then she said fiercely , as color came into her cheeks , " The moment she 's gone you let Jim go ! " There were steps in the upper hall as the nuns appearedP243at the head of the stairs . Susan gave them a glance , then with a swift motion she was at my side . " George will be with his mother . You take charge of Semmes . " Her face was pale again . She put out her hand . " Please ! " There was just time for me to say it . " Jim wo n't leave . " I lien I whispered . " You ca n't get out of it . " Eke nuns were halfway down the stairs when Jane , leaning on Atha , came to the head of the stairs and started clown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fixed my eye upon the hem of her gray dress but when she cane to the foot of the stairs and stopped , still on Atha 's arm , I let my eye travel up to her face : it was covered with a white veil which was tied scarf-like about her neck . She pushed Atha away . " Mama would n't listen to me , " she said in a little voice . She moved her head around as if she were trying to see . " Where 's mama ? " She took a few steps towards the door . " Where 's mama ? Mama would n't listen to me , " she said . The Mother Superior came to her and took her hand , and the other nun falling in with them , they went out of the door and , turning to the right , disappeared . I stood listening . The carriage door closed , and I waited . Blind hoc said , " Giddap , " and the horses moved down the street . At ha closed the door . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from the knob . She raised her expressionless face . " I ai n't white folks , praise be de Lawd , " she said . She disappeared into the back hall . I looked around for sister . The hall was quiet , bright , and empty . I was alone . Until after dinner , I mean dinner-time , for there was no dinner , only some ham and cold biscuits that I called to Blind Joe in the back yard to bring up to me : until , IP244suppose , about two o'clock , I saw nobody , and heard only the vague bustle that meant that they had laid out the old lady in one of the white dresses and were taking her body down to the parlor where it would lie in the coffin until the funeral the next day . Then in her white dress hidden in the ground she would still be white  --  a white dot in Holyrood back of town on the hill . But as time passed I could not stand nor lie nor sit , yet was so tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor sister , with her hair and eyes , and how she must at last be getting a little rest , when there was a knock at the door . I was about to say come in , but I had a presentiment that , after all , it might not be Semmes . I walked to the door and opened it . " Miss Susie say give her de key to de calaboose , " said Blind Joe . I took out the key . " Here , " I said . He rubbed it with his thumb and squinted at me . " ' Tai n't no use . That yaller Nigger he just ai n't got it in him to run away . " " No , " I said , " it 's no use . " Blind Joe was still rubbing the key . I closed the door in his face . Well , she was not getting any rest , and the more I thought of it , I could not see how she had it coming to her . How clearly at that moment I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw it well enough to perceive that Yellow Jim had been used by us all : by Brother George , to get a bay mare and to cut a big dash among strangers ; by sister , to prevent a marriage that out of some deep and , to me , barely discernible level of her being , she hated ; by me even , who had lacked the imaginationto take Jim the night before up the river and , instead of shooting him , to turn him loose and make him run away ; and I had used him again today , boasting of my fault before him as if I expected , as I no doubt did secretlyP245expect , him to applaud the confession ; and then by Jane herself , in some obscure but still culpable motive of shallow hysteria that had impelled her to dramatize her fear of sister into the perpetual fear of women  --  Negro men . Where did it all end ? From the bed of violets at Pleasantfill it seemed a long road to the convent , but I think it no exaggeration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's coffin sister had been leading Jane there . When I denied to Semmes that I loved her , it was as good as telling sister to hasten Jane upon her way . Was she not well out of it ? I looked back to her departure : her small fret , her gray dress , her heavy white veil , but that was all that I could see . I loved her and I could not remember the color of her hair . What had we done to Yellow Jim more than we were , minute by minute , doing to ourselves ? After the carriage drove away , sister , like one possessed , tried every expedient to get Jim to run away . She sent Atha down ; she went down herself ; she offered him money ; she even threatened to add to the story of the assault the lie that Jim had deliberatelyentered old mistis ' room intending to kill her . At intervals Blind Joe came up to report . Sister sent me Word to take Jim to the town marshal as a runaway : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim had assaulted her , and yet sister was willing to let it be known that she had let the criminal go . There was no way around it : Jim could not go . But why did n't he go ? In mid-afternoon- Joe came up again . He stood at the threshold . " He just ai n't got it in him , " he said . He moved into the room and lowered his voice . " And he do n't need to ave it in him . " I went to the window to look down into the court . There as Semmes , dismounting from Queen Susie and looking about him for Joe to take her to the stable . He was dressed all in black  --  black tight trousers over short boots , black sack coat , black soft hat : he looked like a respectable merchant , or his getup , I thought , would do for a wedding or a funeral or even for a man to be laid out in . " Blood thicker'n water , " Joe said . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away to the stable . I turned to look at Joe 's evil face . His yellow buck teeth touched his lower lip . " Blood thicker'n water , " he said . I took a step towards him . " You ought to be whipped for that . Get out of here ! " He sidled away towards the door . " That what Jim say . I ai n't said it . " He grinned . " Jim say blood thicker'n water and he keep on sayin ' it . I ai n't said nothin ' . " He was out in the hall . " Jim say de marster save him when he hear de truf . " He laughed like a Negro at a dice game , and disappeared . I went to the door and closed it : why in the hell , I said , could n't Jane have been afraid of him . At the washstand I dipped the washcloth into the pitcher and held it to my hot eyes . I left my face wet . The stable court was deserted . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was but I could not say come in ; I walked as slowly as I could to the door , yet when I got there I stopped . Why did n't Jim go away ? That was nothing . Why had n't I gone away ? Only because I had wanted to stay to make all the trouble I could out of my lie . There it was , plain as day , but it was too late to do anything about it . I opened the door . Semmes was standing back in the hall with his hat held over his arm , formally , as if he were going in to a reception . The posture was so distinctive that it was only by looking at him again that I avoided saying how-do-you-do . He came into the room , the hat on his arm and the blackP247ring tie dangling rakishly from the low collar . He did not even look queer . As he sat down on the bed still holding the hat , he might  --  but for the bulge of muscle in his clamped jaws  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ? " he said . In the cellar . " I thought if he did n't put the hat down I would take it from him . I kept my eyes on it . I walked up to him , took the hat , and laid it on the bureau . His arm was still raised ; Ire looked at it and dropped it to his leg . Then he began to stare at me . He followed me around the room with his eyes , which I felt on my back as I seized the hairbrush and brushed vigorously at one spot on my head . When I turned lie was looking through me . " Look at something else , brother , " I said . Ile relaxed his jaws . " Why did n't you prevent it ? " I went over to the south window , beyond the foot of the bed , and sat on a low chair . " Who told you ? " I said . " Sister . " He got up and paced twice the length of the room . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor too . " lc turned his gaze upon me again : it was a speculative stare . " Her hair is white . " " Would n't yours be ? " I said . After a long silence I rose and going between the bed and the wall lay down on the bed , facing the wall . I felt the bed move . Semmes too had lain down . The sun had just left the south window , and time was getting on . " Hers should n't be , " he said reasonably . I turned over on my back . He took my hand and gave it a squeeze . " You were in love with her too . " He let go my hand . " And I thought you were just a boy . " " I do n't know , " I said . I sat up and looked down at him over my shoulder . " Look here , " I said . " Sister wanted meP248to take him up the river last night . Today she was willing for him to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I considered the rest of it but I could not make myself say more . I felt that I had said all that I was entitled to say : it was what I had heard and seen , and it was really all that I had known : from it Semmes ought to be able to know as much as I did . He had seen the white hair . But he had a logical mind . He sat up and straightened his tie , and stood in the middle of the floor . I marveled that I had ever hated this man . " Where 's that pistol ? " he said . " There . " I pointed to the bureau . He opened the top drawer and took it out , holding it by the heavy barrel as he spun the cylinder to see that the chambers were loaded . He put it inside his coat and buttonedup the coat , and sat on the edge of the bed . He glanced out of the east window . " It 'll be dark in an hour , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a little while the sky became black , and out of the south window I could see only a little light in the top leaves of the juniper tree that rose to the level of the sill . We were two brothers waiting in a bedroom for it to get dark . The house was so quiet I heard the front door close . Semmes looked at me . We waited . After about a quarter of an hour I decided that Father Monahan or another priest had come in , or perhaps two nuns to take the place of those already there , for the night vigil . Somebody was knocking at the door . I had not heard footsteps . " It 's Blind Joe , " I said ; then , " Come in . " He opened the door but in the dusk I could not see his face . " Marster say come down to de dressin ' room . " And he was gone . P249I leaped to the closet and got my hat and with a bound I was standing in the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let me pass , Lacy , " he said . I stood there . " Stay here ! " He advanced and raised his hand as if he would push me aside . " Make me , " I said . He hesitated , then lowered his arm . I let him pass , and followed him down the stairs . The second floor was deserted and all the doors were c losed . We went into the back hall past Jane 's room to the last room in the hall , and standing before the door Semmes knocked . Immediately the door came open . The bright lamp on the small table in the middle of the room blinded me as I followed Semmes in . Brother George was standing in his shirt sleeves by the washstand behind the door . He pushed the door to , and looked at us . His black trousers were dusty and he held a towel in his hand . " Sit down , gentlemen , " he said . His cold blue eyes burned in a swarthy face , narrower than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Semmes looked at a chair and remained standing . I stood behind him . Brother George tossed the towel upon the rack , took his coat from a chair , put it on , and sat down . " Be seated , gentlemen ! " He said it sharply , and as we backed off to the chairs , he smiled at us . We took seats , and there was a pause . Semmes put his hands upon his knees , and said , " Where 'd you come from , ( ; eorge ? " " Lancaster , Pennsylvania , " he said promptly . He rose and went to a dingy wardrobe by the washstand . Opening one of the doors , he took out a black metal box about twoP250feet long and a foot wide ; he held it a moment , put it back , and closed the door . " Eighty thousand dollars , " he said . " God damn the money . " And he sat down , He contracted his brows as he stared full at the bright lamp . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself again . He looked at Semmes , still frowning . " Otherwise I 'd be in jail , " he said . He got up and threw his head back , looking down at us . " I had to cheat old Cameron on the contracts to cover up the stuff I sent to Richmond . I let Governor Letcher have it at a loss . " He sat down again . He looked at Semmes , then at me . " Howdy , Lacy , " he said . I looked at Semmes , who returned the look and cleared his throat . I glanced covertly at Brother George 's preoccupiedface : the astonishing greeting had come out of no change of expression whatever : a man who could take both views of anything . " But , George , " said Semmes , then stopped in his amazement . George looked at him , and as he looked an expression of intense concentration spread over his face . " We have something to attend to , have n't we , Semmes ? " He looked inquiringly . Semmes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . I got up too . Brother George went to the wardrobe again , and took out two army pistols in holsters . He held one of them out to Semmes . " I have one , " said Semmes . Before George could move I took it by the barrel and pulled it out of his hand . " What 's he got to do with it ? " said George . " I reckon he knows , " Semmes said . He looked at me , and I nodded , and he nodded back . I was astonished and 1I kept hearing You were in love with her too , as George and Semmes waited by the open door . Out in the hall Semmes said , " I suppose there could be a reasonable doubt . " George said nothing , but he turned round and waited . " Of course , " said Semmes , " you 've got it from Susan . You 've seen her hair . " " Hair ? " he said . " I did n't notice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . There was no hesitation in his tread as he walked past George up the hall to the stairs . When we came to him , he did hesitate ; then instead of descending the stairs he went on towards sister 's room where without pause he tapped lightly upon the door . He turned and said in an ordinary tone , " Come here , George , please . " George went , and I followed ; we went up to Semmes as the door opened and old Atha put her head out . Semmes pushed the door back and walked past Atha ; again George and I followed . A candle was burning at each end of the mantelpiece . Sister was sitting bolt upright in a small chair , still in the black crepe , her hands folded in her lap . Her face was in the shadow . We stood like erect mummies looking at the child Jane who was playing with a china doll at her mother 's feet . She banged the head of the doll against the bare floor . " Papa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a voice like a stage direction , " go outside and close the door . " Atha closed the door softly after her . " Papa ? " the child said , looking up at George , who gazed hack at her gravely . " Susan , " George said , " send the child away too . " Little Jane held the doll at arm 's length and dropped i t . It broke evenly in two and lay there . " Papa make money , papa make money , papa make money , " she chanted.  | " Send little Jane away , " George said . He lifted her from the floor , took her to the door , put her outside with , " Here , Atha , " and closed the door . He came back to the center of the room . Susan turned her eyes upon him , throwing her face into the candlelight . There was no expression in the face at all . Her lips were closed and her chin hung a little low , as if she had a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . She looked at us in turn . " Armed to the teeth . " She leaned forward . " Do you need the help of a woman ? " " I think we may have had all the help from you that we need . " It was Semmes . Susan jerked her head towards him and leaned back in her chair . Her lips parted , and into the dry blue of her cheeks came a little flush . " We are here , " he said , " because we thought it might not be as bad as it seemed at first . " Susan looked now as she had when we came in : her hands lay in her lap , her face was white , and if she breathed it would have taken a mirror to show it . Semmes stood over her . " Is there a reasonable doubt ? " he said . She lowered her head and studied a crack in the floor : Semmes all the time was looking at her intently , and now he backed away as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from . Suddenly she lifted her hands , turned the palms up , and examined them . " Well ! " she said , and sighing leaned back in her chair . George came to her and touched her forehead with the tips of his fingers . " Susan ? " he said , and I thought there was a little tendernessin it . He was gazing seriously at her hair . But he might have been putting his hand on a hitch/mg-post : she clenched her fingers and sat like a stone , havingturned her face from him into the light , which put into it the chalky blue of a cold wall . George , clenching his own fists , raised himself to his full height , and turned on his heel . " Come on , " he said to us . He was at the door with his hand on the knob when Susan 's voice came like an unknown , moving object to a little boy in the night . " Mr. Posey , " she said . I jumped as if I had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still facing the door . George let go the doorknob . " Mr. Posey , you know what a fool my brother is . " She looked at Semmes . " He would have shot any man for Mrs. Stacy and now he wants to shoot a Negro for Jane Posey . Because he is a fool who happens to be a gentleman . " She was a blazing fury as she rose to her feet . But her voice was low . " George Posey , if you allow my brother to shoot your brother for you , I will never see you again . " She gazed into his wavering eyes . He looked at the floor , then straightened up , and took the doorknob . He was nodding his head , and it occurred to me absurdly that he was trying to make her a bow . His head stopped moving and a small fixed smile came over his lips as he glanced from Susan to Semmes : it said , Yes , lie 's a fool . Susan was still looking at George . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yellow Jim ? Then I looked at her more closely . She had not moved her eyes from her husband , and in her gaze there was nothing but hate . George was still looking contemptuously at Semmes who looked , not like a fool , but an idiot boy ; his lips were workingand his eyes , wide with wonder , were fixed upon Susan .   " How 'd you know  --  Mrs. Stacy  --  how 'd you know ? " he stammered . She sat down and clasped her hands . I had the impression that she had been in that posture all the time , that we had just entered the room . " I know everything ! " she said . George took Semmes by the arm and led him out of the room . I followed , not glancing back , and closed the door . Atha and the child were gone . Who is to blame now , who is to blame ? I said it to the tramp of our feet as we went downstairs . But it does n't make any difference . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother , Susan had said , when that was where she had wanted him to be , but now she wanted him to go up the river , and I had no doubt , as we went downstairs , that she would still have her way , though the way had been reversed . But it had not been reversed , really , for not being at any rate a monster until George had returned and it was too late to let Jim go , she had been only a Buchan , and to be a Buchan was to be possessedby only one idea at a time . I suppose it was not so simple as that when you came down to it except in the case of papa , whose politics had closed his eyes and whose honor accepted the results of his politics and drove him to the formal repudiation of his son . If papa had not been a Buchan there is hardly a doubt that Semmes would have been with him in Alexandria until the Seventeenth Virginiamoved off to war : he would have written letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have kept them in a little packet until the war was over . There was nobody in the hall when George reached the foot of the stairs and waited for us to come to him . TheP255parlor door was open : I walked round behind George and looked in , seeing two nuns seated impassively one on each side of the coffin and a tall candle burning at head and foot . Miss Milly sat by a lamp near the embroidery frame in a small rocker , looking down through her spectacles , which were pushed forward to the end of her nose , at her tatting : I had a quick vision of the lids of Mr. Jarman 's slopjars when , moving a little nearer to the door , I saw the scholar himself . He sat on the far side of the room midway between the corpse and the light , holding up to the level of his eyes a large paper-back book . But I was looking at Miss Milly . She raised her eyes but still looking over the rims of her glasses  --  although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me , and then spoke as if I had been with her all day : of course , I had not seen her to speak to for a couple of weeks . " And to think I slept through it all . " She looked down at her tatting . " Is George out there ? " she said as if she were asking if her bananas had come . " Yes 'm , " I said , and as I turned round to look at George I regretted it . He looked at me or rather through , over , and around me as if I did n't exist , and he turned upon Semmes  --  whose mouth was still open  --  a malevolent glare ; then he turned his eyes back to me , right at me this time , and walked to the parlor door . He put out his foot to step over the threshold , but withdrew it , and seemed to 1w studying the situation . Miss Milly looked up at him , then at her tatting , then at him again , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Jarman rose , and putting his finger in his place between the leaves of the book , held it under his arm , and advanced upon George . I Ic bowed and held out his hand . " Nephew , " he said , " it pains me to greet you in theseP256melancholy circumstances . " He cleared his throat . " Your mother  --  " " She 's dead , ai n't she ? " said George , looking at him as if he were a child . Mr. Jarman 's hand was still in the air when George abruptly turned away and started for the dining-room . I believe what George had said brought Semmes to himself , for he fell into step with George and we all entered the dining-room together . What a house ! And what people ! I did not quite mean it that way . They were excellent people , but unfortunately for Mr. Jarman 's genealogical researchesI felt , by this time , only a necessary relish in their society . As Brother George threw back the door to the steps down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that I could have put my finger through him . When death could be like this , nobody was living . If they had not been of their Church , they would have thrown one another at death into the river . She 's dead , ai n't she . At least George Posey had spoken it in the English of a gentleman , not in Mr. Jarman 's parrot English , and I did not feel tired as I shuffled sideways down the narrow stairs . George led us in the dark to the lock-up . " Strike a match , somebody , " he said . I got out a match and struck it on my jeans . Atha was sitting on the floor directly in front of the door . She looked up at George . " You come to git him , marster ? " " Move over , Atha , " he said . As she struggled to get up he put out his hand , taking her by the arm , and helped her to her feet . The key was in the lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yellow Jim came out the match burnt my thumb ; I dropped it . In the dark George said , " Go first , Jim . " Jim leading the way , we went out through the kitchenP257to the stable court , then round through the carriage gate into the street , and without stopping and Jim still leading the way walked at the usual pace over to Frederick Street where we turned to the right for the bridge over the canal . In two minutes we passed over the canal and got on the tow-path which brought us quickly to the aqueduct , and from there on the tow-path might have been in deep country : on our left rose tall willows and sycamores , and in the dim light of the quarter-moon I could just discern the top of the stone wall on the land side of the canal , then suddenly round a little bend I saw on the canal 's edge , belowthe wall , a large rock house . George tapped Jim on the shoulder , and went ahead of him . " Step light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on for a mile and a half we were shadows , the more so for the noise of the river that now ran in a narrow channel through huge boulders : it was , I knew , in some places eighty feet deep . We came to a thicket that I knew by the odor of the blossoms to be locust , and George halted . He turned off the tow-path into the bushes , down the steep bank towards the river . We came to a ledge of rock , big enough to build a cabin on , jutting over the water which I could hear swirling , about ten feet below . George , at the far end of the rock , turned and said : " We might as well stop here . " Semmes , next to the river , was facing George at about six paces ; I stood a little away from Semmes near the overhanginglocust leaves and Jim was between me and George standing erect and motionless , but I could not see his face . George 's face received all the moonlight there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his right hand into his coat and took out his pistol . He touched the priming with his left thumb andP258light . His hands were extended a little and his head lifted . " Is you goin ' to kill me , marster ? " His voice rose to a querulous scream of surprise . " George , I thought we understood each other , " Semmes said . He took out the navy revolver . Jim turned his head and looked at Semmes , and the expression I had first seen , wide eyes and open mouth , was frozen . He bent over a little and muttered , and crossed himself very slowly . I think we must have all been staring at him . A pistol shot to my left was from Semmes ' revolver . Jim dropped iii a heap like a rope . He did not move . " You God damn fool , " said George . But I was looking at Semmes . Suddenly he looked startled , fell upon his left knee and swaying slightly pitched like a sack of corn over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saw , delayed , the streak of fire from George 's pistol . He was saying , " I never had any idea of killing that Nigger . " He bent over Jim and felt him , rose and lifted the body with one arm ; he dragged it to the edge of the rock and let it fall into the water . He turned round slowly and looked at me . As he came towards me I backed off , step for step . But he stopped . He moved his foot quickly and kicked into the river the pistol that had fallen from my hand . He took no further notice of me . He walked deliberatelyup the bank through the bushes and disappeared . I went over and looked at the black water and then I was running and my shins burned from the scratches as I passed the rock house . I was running lightly , not out of breath , along the tow-path . I came to the aqueduct and to Frederick Street and crossed the canal . I could see the windowpanes and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm back , " I said , and gazed stupidly towards the east and the rising sun . I looked down the river , and kept look-P259jug . Then I knew what it was . The Confederate flag over Arlington was gone . I had no trouble getting across the Long Bridge : the Virginia side was in the Union lines . I took the back roads along Arlington ridge , and at about seven o'clock that Morning I literally found myself on Montgomery Street in Alexandria , so tired I could taste it , having come out of he trance . It was ten miles in three hours over cart-road and through the brush . Down Montgomery Street I could see the river but I turned down Washington getting some good for the first time out of the fresh morning air . Far clown the street , at the corner of Queen or Cameron , I saw a group of men , but between them and me there was nobody nor was there any sound in the air . The air was clean and livid , and ponderable , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , letting the slanting sun strike the side of my face . When I came up to the men they were silent : I suppose a crowd of about twenty . They did not look at one another . There was nobody I knew . I went round them and looked towards the river , but my eyes did not get that far . In front of the Marshall House , facing it , stood a squad ui Union soldiers at order arms . I left the crowd at the corner , feeling that I was being followed ; taking the inside of the walk and trying to move casually , I hurried ; across the street from the inn I stood behind a lamp post , foolishly , and waited to see what the soldiers would do . ' I hey did nothing . One of them stared at me unseeingly . I looked at the facade of the house . The windows were blank , and as my eyes ran up to the roof I saw the bare flagpole , with the ropes hanging fromp26othe top . They began to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the breeze . The soldiers raised their heads . One boy took off his cap and cheered feebly ; then looked self-consciously at the ground . I glanced over my shoulder towards Washington Street . The crowd at the corner had disappeared . The door of the inn stood open and a sergeant came out . " One and two of the front rank come forward , " he said in a clear voice . The men left the ranks . I ran across the street and along the side of the building to the gate into the back yard . It was open . In the middle of the yard was a small brass cannon , newly furbished . Under the gallery an old Negro man was sitting on a box . As I went past him into the hall he did not look at me . I went through the private diningroom where I saw , on the small table , the row of whisky glasses that the three men had drunk out of , now a hundredyears ago . I opened the door and took one step over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just inside the front door gazing woodenly at the stairs which were concealed from me on my left . The sergeant addressed me . " They got the blind staggers , " he said , tossing his head at them . Then he shouted : " What the Goddamn hell ! " The soldiers moved carefully to a rocking-chair and leaned against it their muskets . I came out into the room , and looked towards the stairs . A pair of legs in brown pantaloons on the third step led to a body on the floor . The face was turned towards me : Mr. Jackson . In the forehead was a hole big as a biscuit cutter ; from it oozed a trickle of blood down the nose to the black mustache , from which it was dripping to a wide pool on the boards . Not two feet from Mr. Jackson 's head lay another : the body was stretched full length , face up  --  the handsomest face IP261had ever seen , large delicate nose , wide thin mouth , high cheekbones . I thought instantly of Brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a colonel 's ; and on the belt-buckle , spelt out in full : MASSACHUSETTS . He might have been asleep , so flushed was his face , had it not been for the blood running from both ears and mingling with Mr. Jackson 's blood upon the crumpled Confederate flag that lay under him . I looked at the sergeant and the sergeant looked at me . " Colonel Ellsworth , " he said . " The first to be killed by a rebel . " He looked at the bodies . " I killed the rebel . " The soldiers came forward and as they stooped over the colonel 's body , I ran out through the dining-room . I heard the sergeant 's voice . " Hey , you , wait a minute . " And as I reached the back hall : " What the hell ! " But there were no footsteps as I stood listening by the old Negro man under the back porch . " Where 're the Confederates ? " I said . " The gloomy expression under the grizzled wool did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' em . Yestiddy . " He rose and hobbled towards a shed at the far end of the yard . " It ai n't no skin off my belly , " he said over his shoulder . Free Nigger , I said , running out of the gate into the street , which was still deserted . But I better not run , I said . I tried to walk but I walked a little and ran a little till I came to Fairfax Street and turned right , and I ran all the way to Duke ; but at the corner I paused . Maybe I can get upstairs without being seen , maybe papa is eating his breakfast . I 'll see Coriolanus first . Then I remembered when I had last stood on that corner : where were Hank I lerbert and Jack Armistead now ? I walked with natural steps to the front door . I turned the knob cautiously and pushed against the door . It was locked . The garden gate , I said . But on the sidewalk I looked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my eyes . The blinds in the second and third storey windows were closed . The garden gate was half open . I went in . The side door was locked , and on the porch floor lay a rotting potato . I went out of the gate , and round the corner up Duke Street , but I had to walk now , my feet were so heavy , and I do not know how long it took me to get to the edge of town and out into the country . I cut southwards through the fields to Cameron Run and not finding a bridge or a ford I swam it in my clothes , and clambered up the bank shocked and cool , and made my way a mile through the fields again , to the Telegraph Road that runs southwards , and came over a hill to a big tobacco barn by the roadside . A quarter of a mile away on the other side of the hill was a Negro plowing a field . I stepped over the rail fence and went into the barn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled the door to after me . It 's a good place , I said . I went to a pile of tobacco stems , smoothed them flat , and lay down . I sank lower and lower , almost to the level of the floor where Mr. Jackson and the Yankee colonel lay . That was n't anything , I said . They did n't even know each other . That was n't anything at all . I sank lower and lower into the dark , getting heavier all the time ; then I was light and smothered as I sank into the suck of black water and did n't feel anything more . When I awoke it was pitch dark . There was no struggle to come out of it ; my mind was clear . Had Blind Joe really gone for Brother George ? I better go down and see if Yellow Jim 's had any water . Water , I said . I openedP263my mouth but my tongue was too big for it and stuck to my teeth . Both hands prickled . I rose on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I tried to move them they were stiff . I sneezed and thought it would break every bone in my body . I put my hand to the ground and felt the tobacco stems . The acrid dust filled my nostrils and I sneezed again . I tried to see around me . The long slits of light that I had seen when I came in were gone . There was a gray rectangle and I went towards it . Outside the stars on one side of the heavens were bright but towards the southeast they were dim , with none at all on the horizon , which was pallid . I got over the rail fence , slowly , into the road and went away from the rising light . I came to a clear , sluggish branch , took off my clothes , and lay a long time under the water . My head towards the current , I let the crawfishy water run into my mouth , swallowing a little of it at a time . When I had dressed , a copper sun came up out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the railrooad , and then eight more . When I came to the Lick Road forking to the right , I cut below it through the brush and across Long Branch to the railroad tracks , which I followed southwards for a mile to the Pohick crossing , then turned northwest along the Pohick Road and after about two miles came to a crossroadand paused to look at a big cabin on a little knoll to my right , about fifty yards from the road . There was an old man sitting on the front porch , leaning on a long stick which he held between his knees . A lively smoke rose Isom one of the chimneys . In the front yard there was a well . I turned into the lane . When I came to the well I stopped . " Good morning , sir , " I said to the old man . He put his head forward and a stream of ambeer shot out of his mouth . " Good morning , " he said . He looked me over . " Better come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He glanced at the sky . " Could I get a drink , please ? " I said . He spat again . " I reckon you mought , " he said . He rose and leaned on his stick . " You ai n't no Yankee , air ye ? I ai n't goin ' to have no Yankees a-drinkin ' of my water . I 'll ' spectorate in hit fust . " He wrinkled his nose and spat out another stream . " No , sir , I ai n't a Yankee . " I advanced a few steps . " I 'm Major Buchan 's son , " I said . He nodded his head . " I 'm glad to see you , son . " He waved his hand . " Ever'thing I got is yours . " He hobbled down off the porch and came slowly to the well . He turned back the lid , put the bucket inside , and held the rope . " Now ai n't that a coinci-dence . Hit wa' n't a week ago I seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says he , The Major 's in fer a big surprise when he comes back from Alexandry . The Niggers wo n't work and that young Higgins is a-beatin ' ' em . ' That 's what he said , son . Ai n't nothin ' to Higgins , ai n't a thing to none of ' em . I knowed ' em all for yares . " He rested the bucket against the lid . " Ai n't no business of mine but I say what can you expect when you sign all your prop'ty away . Like the Major done . That 's what I say . " He was about to lower the bucket when a common water snake of the harmless sort crawled up on the lid and , gliding off , disappeared into the well . He arrested the descent of the bucket again . " I put that snake in thar . Snakes eat frogs . When I come out o ' nights to get a drink , I ai n't as apt to swaller a snake as I am a frog . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you put a hog in the well ? Hogs eat snakes . You ai n't so aptP265to swaller a hog as you air a snake . I ai n't never seen nobody swaller a hog as you might say , whole . " The speaker was a tall sallow young man with a wry face . He looked at me , then at the old man . " Good morning , Mr. Regan , " he said cheerfully . I looked at the old man again . It was indeed Mr. Regan . saw him again leaning on his sassafras stick in the court ( ) Ilse yard . The stick now was hickory . He looked at me , nodding his head towards the young man . " Dick Dogan 's a case , " he said . " He 's a case . " He let the rope , and faced Mr. Dogan . " Dick , how 's your issus ? " " Dead , " said Mr. Dogan . " Dead as a herring . " Mr. Regan looked a little taken aback . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He paused . I 'll just tell Mrs. Regan to step over to see what she can do . " Mr. Dogan was looking extremely solemn . " I 'm obleeged to you , Mr. Regan , but I thought you folks mought mind the chillen . " He turned and called , " Come hyar . " I had n't seen them : five little children in a row , about twenty paces away , lined up like stair-steps in the order of age and staring at us woodenly . Mr. Regan turned towards the house , followed by Mr. Dogan . I seized the rope and dropped the bucket into the well , and drew it up full . The snake was not in it . I tipped the bucket and drank till I could hold no more . As I set it down I called out , " I 'm much obliged to you , M r . Regan . " He turned around and opened his mouth . " Well , now  --  " but I did n't wait to hear it . I ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I started with a steady pace on the last stretch towards home.
