txt Detroit is pondering over the rather unusual anomaly of extreme inactivity in the Ford camp with persistent rumors of another close-down in contrast with the renewed activities at Chevrolet , Pontiac , Essex and Plymouth . Some veteran sales executives are shaking their beads and saying : " If the times were right Ford , past master at judging his market , would be doing something . " On the other hand , an equally sophisticated body of opinion holds that declining production with most of the industry for almost a year warrants resumption of manufacturing now for a come-back after the turn of the year . It is pointed out in sales circles that the amount of shifting by retail purchasers from a car of one make to another is not as great as generally supposed . Packard has made an exhaustive research in that respect and has found that for several years a definite percentage of repeat business always has been available . Packard 's findings show that if business conditions prevent a full quota of repeat orders in any one year , the deficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . In other words , individual conditions in each company 's established trade have dictated resumption of operations quite as well as general business conditions . Ford V-Eight Announcement in 1831 Possible The bringing out of new models by Chevrolet and Hudson prior to the usual time was due in each case to the fact that stocks of cars , both new and used , had been worked down to a low point . The Ford Motor Co. , on the other hand , operated on a high schedule into the summer months and is now holding output in check , apparently believing conditions do not favor an early increase in sales . In fact , Detroit would not be surprised if the Ford plants were shut down the last two weeks of December and possibly the first ten days of January to permit the absorption of accumulated stocks . Ford has stimulated sales to some extent by introducing the new Victoria , a live-passenger coupe listing at $625 , and by building sport and deluxe models . No present indication is seen of a change in the line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , little is being heard of that . The trade looks for the announcement of the long-discussed Ford V-type eight sometime in 1931 , but reports do not agree as to the probable price , some placing it as low as $800 and others as high as $1,400 . Detroit is agreed that a new and radically different Ford is in existence , but does not look for it to be offered soon . In fact , if Ford invades a price field between that of the Model A and the Lincoln , it will amount to an unprecedented change of policy . Industry Continues to Reduce Car Stocks Banking interests here that have followed the rising star of the Ford fortunes declare that one of the biggest items in Ford goodwill has been the universal acceptance of the doctrine that Ford is not an octopus seeking to gobble up the whole motor business , but is content to do a good job dominating the lowest price field . Thus , conjecture runs in this city concerning its largest single industrial member , whatever finally emerges from the Ford camp probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same as emerged out of the welter of conjecture and speculation about the Model A in 1927 , rather than something that would upset established trade domains . In the meantime , the industry continues to get its house in order , clearing out car stocks , cutting costs in every direction and making ready for the eventual trade revival .
