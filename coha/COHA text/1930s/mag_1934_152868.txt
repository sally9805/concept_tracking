Last week on more than 125 college fields , more than 250 football teams got their new uniforms dirty for the first time in the 1934 season . <P> At Palo Alto . Calif. , where the temperature was almost 90 , the biggest crowd of the week ( 45,000 ) saw Santa Clara tie Stanford , 7-to-7 , in the last quarter . <P> At Los Angeles , Southern California barely nosed out College of the Pacific , coached by Amos Alonzo Stagg , 6-to-0 . <P> At West Point , Army gave its young Coach Gar Davidson the jitters for three periods , finally managed to beat Washburn , 19-to-0 . <P> Northwestern 's first appearance , against Marquette , was featured by forward passes by a tall senior named George Potter which enabled his team to win 21-to-12 . <P> On a rain-drenched field at Nashville , Vanderbilt nosed out Mississippi State , 7-to-0 . <P> Rules . New football regulations this year are based on the premise that crowds want to watch an open game . Forward passing is favored with a ball an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass across the goal line ( except on fourth down ) no longer causes loss of the ball . The 5-yd. set-back for two incomplete passes in one series of downs has been removed . Because coaches last year decided that the defense had too many advantages , another rule , designed to popularize quick kicks , permits a punter to have a teammate hold the ball in position for a kick . <P> Schedules . In 1926 , the Harvard Lampoon published a cartoon which implied that Princeton men were pigs . The result of this appalling insult was one of the most profound and bitter academic breaks in the history of sport . For four years , no Princeton teams played Harvard at any sport . After four years , contests in everything but football were arranged . Last winter , officials of both universities held an epochal meeting . The result was an agreement whereby Princeton will play Harvard at football for the first time in eight years at Cambridge , Nov. 3 . Since Army and Navy settled their historic differences and resumed their annual games two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in intercollegiate football . <P> Other novelties on the season 's schedule : 1 ) this week 's game , the first in 29 years between Yale and Columbia . Rose Bowl Champions , instead of the " setup " with which the Yale season normally starts ; 2 ) an Eastern Big Four , composed of Princeton , Yale , Harvard and Dartmouth ; 3 ) ten teams in the Pacific Coast Conference which will travel a total of 71,000 miles during the season . <P> Material , the uncomplimentary word with which at the start of the season college football coaches describe undergraduates who play the game , was one main subject of discussion last week . At Princeton. 30 members of the squad were ill from food poisoning . At the University of Missouri . Coach Frank Carideo , one-time Notre Dame quarterback , ordered his players to attend classes in corduroy trousers , wear no ties or vests . Reason : " When a player begins to worry about his clothes , he becomes less of a football player and more of a loafer . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk down the street people will recognize them as football players . "
