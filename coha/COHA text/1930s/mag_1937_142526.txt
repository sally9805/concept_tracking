<P> When British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden signed the Anglo-Egyptian treaty in the magnificent " Locarno Room " of the British Foreign Office ( TIME , Sept. 7 ) he intimated that Britain was no longer Egypt 's boss but her " partner . " As an earnest of good will the British Government promised to urge at Geneva admission of Egypt to the League of Nations , promised to ask eleven other States , which like Britain have long enjoyed extraterritorial rights ( " capitulations " ) for their citizens in Egypt , to surrender them . <P> Last week Egypt was still not a member of the League of Nations but , mindful of Britain 's promise about " capitulations , " gathered together representatives of the twelve capitulatory powers , including the U. S. , in the hotel at Montreux , Switzerland where last July the Powers agreed to restore the Dardanelles to Turkey ( TIME , July 27 ) . Master of ceremonies was Egypt 's ambitious Premier Mustafa El Nahas Pasha . <P> Capitulations , the sharpest thorn in Egypt 's flesh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not forced to pay taxes to the Egyptian Government ; foreigners involved in criminal cases go before their own consular courts , while civil cases go before mixed courts on which foreign representatives sit . Specially oppressive to Egypt are the fiscal capitulations because more than $12,000,000,000 of foreign money is invested in that country , and owing to tax immunities the Egyptian Government is deprived of what it considered a large legitimate income . The U. S. has nearly $15,000,000 invested there , represented by the American University of Cairo , a hospital , mission schools and such companies as General Motors and Socony-Vacuum Oil . <P> Because delegates from Italy , Portugal and Spain were present when the Conference opened , each eyeing the others with a smoldering eye , Premier Nahas tactfully suggested that the usual exchange of cards should be cut out . The " family atmosphere , " created by the hotel , he declared , made formality unnecessary . <P> Cool and self-confident was Premier Nahas for he knew he had the whip hand . Egypt off her own bat can legally renounce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Russia 's case . The Premier preferred not to resort to highhandedness , yet it was crystal-clear to the delegates that he had won his battle before he started . The nub of the discussion was whether or not Egypt would be willing to abolish capitulations by slow degrees . <P> Bluntly Premier Nahas told the delegates what he wanted-immediate abolition of fiscal privileges for foreigners . If the Conference met him on that he would agree to a gradual assumption of Egyptian court control . <P> Next day U. S. Minister Bert Fish , one of northeastern Florida 's wealthiest men , handsomely backed the Egyptians with many a mention of President Roosevelt 's " good-neighbor policy . " Declared Minister Fish : " The U. S. will pursue no exclusively national interest . . . . We warmly compliment Egypt on beginning her international career by choosing the way of friendly negotiation . "
