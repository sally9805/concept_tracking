txt President Hoover favors the selection of Dwight W. Morrow as the Republican nominee for United State Senator in New Jersey , David Baird Jr. , the present Senator , asserted yesterday during a tour of southern counties with the Ambassador to Mexico . Invading anew the dry territory below Camden with Mr. Morrpw , Senator Baird , the outstanding political , figure of the area , avowed that reports of administration backing of Franklin W. Fort , one of Mr. Morrow 's rivals , were groundless and that the President was " intensely interested " in having Mr. Morrow named at the primary election on Tuesday . Senator Baird motored through Gloucester and Salem Counties with the Ambassador and made several appearances in various cities and villages . He chose Pitman for his declaration of Presidential support and said : " There is a big job to be done in the Senate , and we need a , big man to do it . One of the other candidates for this nomination has ten colleagues in Congress , and all ten of them are for Mr. Morrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only man standing out for the Republican nomination who can win in November is Dwight Morrow . If he is defeated , Alexander Simpson . the Demo , re ' candidate  --  a wringing wet  --  will be elected , and after that will come open Sundays for New Jersey . " Cheers greeted Mr. Baird 's statement and he continued : " We hear much in this campaign of the friendship of President Hoover for Franklin W. Fort , Mr. Morrow 's opponent , but I am able to assure you that President Hoover himself is intensely interested in seeing New Jersey send Dwight Morrow to the Senate . " Morrow Silent on Assertion . Mr. Morrow remained silent despite this utterance of Presidential favor in his own presence , and Senator Baird himself did not enlarge upon it . With numerous reports of White House backing spreading through the State ever since Mr. Fort entered the three-cornered race as a dry , Mr. Baird 's outspoken assertion was viewed as carrying considerable significance . While Mr. Morrow was swinging through the State , Dr. John Grier Hibben , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a radio appeal for his nomination , to which be joined praise of the Ambassador 's stand for repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment . At the same time he disavowed suggestions that Mr. Morrow should be considered as a Presidential rival of Mr. Hoover in 1932 . Joseph S. Frelinghuysen spent an active day at Asbury Park and in Essex County . In a public prediction of his own victory , he again assailed his opponents on the ground that they had avoided what he said were the real issues of the campaign  --  public utility regulation , the Hudson county " ripper bills " the World Court and " bossism . " He also attacked the participation of churches i the party battle , and , referring to the effort to organize the church vote for Representative Franklin W. Fort , the dry candidate , avowed that this was an improper " invasion " of // the churches into a sphere alien to their correct work . Ford Predicts Own ' Victory . Mr. Fort was prevented from campaigning during the afternoon by the necessity of going to Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While there he also issued a prediction of his success on Tuesday and declared that while at the outset he had been extremely doubtful about his chances he was now certain of victory . All three candidates will remain on the stump through tomorrow . Mr. Morrow will be in Asbury Park , Mr. Fort in Hunterdon . Warren and Sussex counties and Mr. Frelinghuysen in Newark . Mr. Morrow will be busy today at his Englewood home , where he will be visited by a delegation of gold star mothers and World War veterans . Charles G. Dawes , Ambassador to the Court of St. James 's , is a week-end guest at the Morro* home . Dr. Hibben in Radio Appeal . Dr. Hibben , speaking over WOR , referred in his diavowal of Presidential rivalry between Mr. Morrow and Mr. Hoover , to a recent rally in Trenton , where former Governor Stokes first put the Ambassador forward as " Presidential timber , " and then Dr. Hibben agreed that a conception of Mr. Morrow as President was not a " wild stretch of the imagination . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct a misapprehension which seems to have been lodged in the minds of some of the voters of the party in the State . I ' resent the false inference drawn from any words of mine on a recent occasion that I had suggested directly or indirectly Mr. Morrow as a Presidential candidate . I am an ardent and loyal supporter of President Hoover and his administration and would wish no one in the State to misinterpret my position . " Again , there are some who have been falsely led to believe that Mr. Morrow 's frank and courageous statement concerning the Eighteenth Amendment aligns him with the bootleggers , the rum runners and all engaged illicitly today in the manufacture , transportation and distribution of liquor . I have no doubt that it is because he hates them and the disastrous results of their nefarious traffic that he has made the statement publicly that this present condition of affairs should be recognized and changed . For ten years before the Eighteenth Amendment became constitutional law he worked and fought against the dominance of the saloon , as a social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known . He will oppose with equal vehemence the return of the saloon in any form . " When suggested as a candidate for the office of United States Senator , he could have shrewdly played the part of a practical politician and have kept silent on the subject of prohibition . But it was not in his nature to do so . This pressing problem of the nation was on his mind and conscience , and being the man that he is , he had to speak out . This courageous utterance , whether you agree with him or not , must command your respect , for it indicates that such a man will not and can not say or do anything in order to secure any political advantage to himself . " Attacks Professor Fisher . Dr. Hibben went on to attack Professor Irving Fisher of Yale , who came into the campaign in behalf of Representative Fort , and said : " In a recent speech in New Jersey Professor Fisher has pilloried me with Mr. Morrow in his denunciation of the Ambassador and his position on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in favor of the Eighteenth Amendment , had high hopes and expectations that it might be effectively enforced . I have come gradually to the recognition of the breaking down of the Federal enforcement . For ten years Dean Gauss and I have been endeavoring to close a number of roadhouses where liquor is sold , within a radius of ten miles of Princeton . It has been a very difficult and losing fight . If in this small area the police power of the Federal Government has proved ineffective , what can we hope for the future in the Federal policing of the tremendous area of our country ? " I recognize an essentially moral issue in this whole question and that is the reason I have taken the stand which I have done . There are too many people who are willing to have the Eighteenth Amendment nominally retained as a law for political purposes rather than having any interest or desire to prevent drunkenness itself . " Professor Fisher evidently takes the position that if the law is obeyed he does not care to what extent it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hideously immoral suggestion in his recent book on the Eighteenth Amendment , when he says ' I have long thought that the Eighteenth Amendment should have more explicitly exempted the home . It would enormously simplify the problem of enforcement . ' " The best blood in America is being polluted by the present flood of illicit liquor , distributed and sold by as criminal a group as ever appeared in a civilized land . Contempt for law has been fostered among young and old , rich and poor alike , and the whole traffic has in its wake bribery on an extensive scale such as : ? never been known in our country before . " The only man in public life at present who recognizes this intolerable situation and has the courage state his views frankly and to offer constructive leadership in a reform imperatively needed is Dwight W. Morrow . " Emerson Backs Morrow . Mr. Morrow gained a new sup-. porter when State Senator Emerson L. Richards of Atlantic City , hitherto considered a backer of Mr. Frelinghuysen , proclaimed hirnself for the Ambassador . The Frelinghuysen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Frelinghuysen , predicting victory , said : " I have made my fight in this campaign in the interests of all thpeople of New Jersey . They now understand the powerful influences , political and otherwise , that are ar-I. rayed against me and it is from th-. people that I confidently expect my . support on primary day . " They will look the facts squarely in the face and will not be misled by manufactured sentiment or by a press whose clamor is equaled only , by the silence of its candidate . They . will judge the future by the pest ! and will place the proper value not only upon experience but upon frankness and integrity of purpose . ' " With this the fact , there can be no doubt of Tuesday 's outcome . It will be my nomination for United ' States Senator . " Mrs. Morrow will re-enter the calm . ' paign tomorrow night to issue a last ; minute appeal for her husband at meeting at the high school in Ridgewood . While an " expected important event " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been . anticipated , would keep the candidate 's wife away , it was announced , at the Ambassador 's Newark head-11 quarters , that she would fulfill this engagement .
