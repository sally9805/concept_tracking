THE SONG OF THE WORLD - Jean Giono - Viking ( $2.50 ) . <P> " The present time disgusts me , even to describe . It is sufficient merely to endure it . " Thus spake , not James Branch Cabell nor Herbert Hoover , but one Jean Giono . Up to last week French Author Giono was practically unknown to U. S. readers . With the publication of The Song of the World he became a writer who should , and probably will , be known much better . A robust romantic who has been compared to Homer , Walt Whitman and D. H. Lawrence , Jean Giono writes with an earthly smack and tang that urban readers will find especially appetizing . Obviously not a great book , The Song of the World is just as obviously a work of great talent . A modern anomaly , it is French but romantic , sensual but serious . <P> Laid in an unspecified time ( there are shotguns and gendarmes but no mention of railroads , automobiles or telephones ) , in an unspecified place ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the foothills of the French Alps ) , the story tells of peasants whom time has never modernized , whose mountains , forest and farmland are as wide as the world . Antonio , a fisherman , lives by himself on an island in the river . In the forest nearby live old Sailor , his wife and his son 's widow . Sailor 's only remaining son , called the Twin , has gone far up the river to cut logs , float them down on a raft . When months pass and the Twin does not return , Sailor comes to Antonio for help . Together they set off to look for the lost son . <P> In the unknown country beyond the river 's gorges they find a blind woman in the throes of childbirth . At the house to which they carry her they pick up the first trace of the Twin 's trail ; as they travel on , luck and sharp ears bring them all the answers they are looking for . The Twin is still alive , but the whole country side is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Maudru , breeder of bulls , a proud , autocratic man . The Twin has not only fallen in love with Maudru 's only daughter but quarreled with Maudru 's nephew over her , shot the nephew and carried off the girl . Antonio and Sailor finally discover the runaway couple hidden away in the house of a healer . Winter shuts in and holds them all there . Maudru has kept the police out of the affair by swearing that his nephew 's death was an accident ; he means to take vengeance into his own hands . <P> News of the Twin 's hideaway leaks out to Maudru 's men , but because the refugees keep careful watch , never go out alone , nothing happens . Both sides wait for spring . Then one night old Sailor , out with Antonio for a long-deferred spree , is caught alone , stabbed to death . The Twin sets out singlehanded to avenge himself on Maudru , with Antonio 's help raids the great Maudru farm , sets fire to every stable , the house itself , gets away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their getaway down river , Maudru 's daughter included .
