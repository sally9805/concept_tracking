( See front cover ) Ten minutes before the short Saturday session officially closed on the New York Cotton Exchange last week , a gong brought trading on the world 's biggest cotton futures market to a silent halt . The U. S. Crop Reporting Board , having been locked in secret session in Washington since dawn , was about to release its first estimate of the U. S. cotton crop for the new crop year which opened Aug. 1 . Trading also stopped on the country 's other two cotton futures markets , in Chicago and New Orleans . On the spot markets scattered throughout the cotton belt the morning 's desultory dickering petered out . In Britain the Liverpool Cotton Market had closed for the day , but traders would get the U. S. cotton news after the races and the cricket matches . In Bombay , Shanghai , Osaka the Orient 's cotton men roused themselves from bed or stirred impatiently in club chairs . In Egypt , where the world 's finest cotton is grown on the banks of the Nile , the cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Eastern Daylight Saving Time , the figures flashed to the waiting cotton world . It was the Government 's guess , the best to be had , that this season 's crop in the biggest cotton land in the world would be 12,481,000 bales of about 500 Ib. each. * Last year the crop was 10,638,000 bales . The estimate was a little higher than expected , although Clinton T. Revere , famed cotton expert for the Manhattan firm of Munds , Winslow &; Potter , scored a bull's-eye with a private estimate of 12,498,000 bales , only 17,000 above the Government figure . A month ago the Crop Board estimated that this year 's cotton acreage was up less than 10% from the 1935-36 season , and cotton prices jumped to 12 per Ib . Last week , as favorable news of crop conditions accumulated in advance of the Government 's estimate , the price slipped below 12 . After the figures were out cotton dropped still further , opening this week around 11 ? . <P> As the cotton season progresses , less &; less interest is taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumption throughout the world in the season just ended set a new high , exceeding even the 1928-29 peak when the world used 25,778,000 bales . Meantime world carry-over has been reduced from a staggering total of 17,600,000 bales in 1932 to about 12,500,000 bales which is not far above normal . In the dark of Depression the U. S. carry-over accounted for no less than 13,000,000 of the world 's 17,600,000 bales . Today this U. S. surplus is down to about 7,100,000 which is also not far above normal , even though the Government owns one-half of it . <P> Lint Land . Before the Crop Board could be locked up for its secret ciphering last week , before field estimators and picked farmers could furnish the figures with which it arrived at its estimate , some 30,000,000 acres of farm land had to be plowed , harrowed and seeded in that area of the continental U. S. where the growing season from frost to frost is at least seven months . Planting started , as it does each season , in Southern Texas in late winter .
