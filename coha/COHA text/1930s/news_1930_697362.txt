txt Our Economic System . ' To the Editor of The New York Times : In THE TIMES of Aug. 19 is a letter from Edmund C. Evans , who says that Mr. and Mr. Hoover " made the mistake of asserting beforehand that they knew how to cure 1 all the people 's ills . " Mr. Hoover never made such a statement and I doubt if Mr. did , as he is far too shrewd to indulge in that sort of thing . Mr. Evans says our system violates ! justice and natural law . He does not I tell us how . He speaks of the " economic system of privilege " sustained ! by the modern State based on land monopoly , tariff harriers and trade restrictions . The is plenty of land unoccupied which can be had for the taking , but the people who object to what they call " land monopoly " really want to divide up not the land in its natural state but those things that other people , by their labor and savings , have put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their labor and savings have made more valuable . In other words , they want to divide up the results of other people 's labors and savings without compensation . This was the plan of the Soviet Government of Russia . He says that " since the closing of the frontier in the United States similar conditions confront us here . " The similar conditions are apparently unemployment , and it takes but a small amount of logic and common sense to see that if we admitted more people at the present time there would be more unemployment , FRANCIS RALSTON WELSH .
