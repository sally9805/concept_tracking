Among the departments in Cornell University 's College of Home Economics , one is concerned exclusively with family life . A professor in this department is tiny , motherly Mrs. Ethel B. Waring . Last week Professor Waring gave U. S. mothers a formula , in nine neat points , to solve a baffling problem : how to get Junior to drink his orange juice ( or eat his spinach ) . It took Mrs. Waring 15 years to develop her formula . In the college 's laboratory nursery school , she one day decided to take sound movies ( unobserved ) of her tots ' behavior . She found the movies illuminating . Eventually she made a reel showing the right and the wrong way to approach her central problem-orange juice . First scene , picturing a young mother 's desperate attempt , ends with her youngster screaming , the orange juice untouched . Second scene shows a teacher whose timing is expert , ends with smiling Junior drinking it all up . In the third scene the mother , now better informed , also succeeds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not work if their order is changed ) : <P> 1 ) Watch and wait ; Junior may drink by himself .

( Mother sat at table with Junior . ) <P> 4 ) Approve what he does well .

( Mother helped Junior lift cup . ) <P> 6 ) Prepare for success and direct the child confidently . ( Junior seemed about to drink . ) <P> 7 ) Let him alone if he needs no more help . ( Junior pondered , put cup down again , appeared to forget it . ) <P> 8 ) Give increasing help , more specific directions . ( Mother firmly showed Junior how to pick up cup , put it to his lips . ) <P> 9 ) Withdraw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . ( Mother soft-pedaled her urgings , beamed confidently . At length , in his own good time , Junior laughed , seized the cup , drained it. )
