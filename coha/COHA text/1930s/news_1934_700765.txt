txt American Woolen Co. is understood to have paid off this week the last of its floating debt and is now completely " out of the banks . " At the opening of the second half year bank loans totaled $2,100,000 and six months earlier $5,850.000 . While gratifying to management and directors . the achievement would be more satisfactory did it reflect liquidation of goods and accounts through the healthy processes of active and prosperous business . As it is , it reflects the rapid subsidence Of manufacturing activities and the even speedier reduction of forward orders , which would require the accumulation of inventories , involving possibly some bank accommodation . The extension of the customary Labor Day shutdown into a probable suspension of most mill operations at Lawrence for an additional fortnight tells its own story of the paucity of orders that has prevailed through the late spring and summer in the woolen and worsted industry . There is no hard and fast program of shutdown , manufacturing being suspended only in units that have no orders on which to run . The intense depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third quarter , naturally jeopardizes the $5 preferred dividend in view of the $585,000 loss in the first six months and the deficit of $1,584,000 after dividends for that period . Directors are scheduled to meet early in September , the date depending upon the arrival of certain members now abroad . Unless conditions suddenly improve it would seem as though the chances of continuance of the $5 rate inaugurated early in the year were , on the face of things , slender .
