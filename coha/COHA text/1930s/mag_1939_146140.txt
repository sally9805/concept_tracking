Last week New York City 's Board of Education prepared to dismiss 6,819 teachers , shut night schools , pare many another expense . Reason : Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia had cut the board 's budget $3,000,000 , and the State Legislature had cut another $5,300,000 . As parents and teachers indignantly protested against " wrecking " of their school system , Manhattan 's Borough President Stanley M. Isaacs dramatically demanded that the city 's top school officials take a voluntary salary reduction of 5% to 10% , as had other city officials , including Mayor LaGuardia ( $22,500 ) , Park Commissioner Robert Moses ( $12,150 ) , Police Commissioner Lewis Valentine ( $11,250 ) . The school officials as dramatically rejected his demand . Thereupon Mr. Isaacs ticked off some pedagogical salaries , to the surprise of not a few New York City taxpayers and the envy of many and many a pennyscraping U. S. pedagogue : <P> Superintendent of Schools Harold George Campbell-$25,000. * <P> Nine associate superintendents-$12,500 each . <P> Seven examiners ( of teachers ) - $11,000 each . <P> Thirty assistant superintendents and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. educator 's salary , which is believed to be University of Pittsburgh 's Chancellor John Gabbert Bowman 's $35,000.
