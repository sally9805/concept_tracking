Title 1 , Section 2 of the late Reorganization Bill of 1938 would have empowered the President to regroup , coordinate , consolidate , reorganize , or segregate any Government agency in the interest of efficiency . Last week Secretary of Agriculture Henry Agard Wallace , on the night before his Soth birthday , announced without to-do a reorganization of his department as drastic as any Franklin Roosevelt might have made . His reason : efficiency . <P> Under the New Deal , Agriculture , besides being a research and service department like Commerce , has also been through Agricultural Adjustment Administration a vast agency for distributing Government funds , like WPA . Which the cart and which the horse has been hard for any one to say . <P> Last week 's major Wallace maneuver amounted to dismantling AAA and moving it behind the lines . Although the name and a skeleton organization remain , AAA 's major functions were parcelled out among four new Department divisions : 1 ) Plan-ning-headed by present AAAdministrator Howard R. Tolley , who will become head of the Bureau of Agricultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albert G. Black of the Bureau of Agricultural economics ; 3 ) Physical Land Use-headed by Chief H. H. Bennett of the Soil Conservation Service ; 4 ) Research &; Technology- headed by Chief Henry G. Knight of the Bureau of Chemistry &; Soils . <P> To these policy-making divisions and executives go AAA 's long-range soil and planning programs . AAA itself will be a strictly administrative unit , with Secretary Wallace 's Special Assistant Rudolph M. Evans as its new administrator . <P> " The changes . . . " said Mr. Wallace , " bring the full range of the Department 's resources to bear on ... major problems . " Significant in the reshuffling of Agriculture 's personnel was the upping of Economists Tolley and Black to executive positions second only to Henry Wallace 's . <P> Key man in the shift , however , was Assistant AAAdministrator Jesse W. Tapp , chosen to run Federal Surplus Commodities Corp . and marketing agreements as Mr. Black 's right-hand man . <P> A Kentuckian of 38 who worked in Agriculture when Henry Wallace 's father was Secretary in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which favors subsidizing home instead of foreign consumption of U. S. farm surpluses . Since August , FSCC has dumped 11,500,000 bushels of wheat abroad at an average loss of 12.6 a bushel . The tip from Tapp is that FSCC may soon shift its dumping ground to the U. S. , specifically to the 20,400,000 users of farm products now on Relief . <P> Cheerless was the Department when its Crop Reporting Board , which month ago forecast an uncomfortably large 1938 cotton crop of 11,825,000 bales , had to revise its estimate upward to 12,212,000 bales , based on a per-acre yield higher than any save 1937 's . Cheering was news from Macon , Ga . that a three-judge Federal court had upheld the constitutionality of AAA 's tobacco-marketing agreements , ruled that AAA could collect penalty taxes from a group of South Georgia growers who had marketed tobacco in excess of their quotas .
