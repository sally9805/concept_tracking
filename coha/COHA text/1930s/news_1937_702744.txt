txt The French Government is launching a determined campaign to halt the spreading financial demoralization , which has followed the recent abandonment of a gold peg for the franc , and which was reflected last week in daily new lows for the franc and for leading securities here . Finance Minister Bonnet is expected to take immediate steps to make credit easy and to sustain and gradually raise the price of government bonds through the use of public funds . This would be accompanied by stimulation of the market for short term Treasury bills , which has long been stagnant and , if revived , would greatly assist financial operations of the Government . It is thought that this policy , backed by decree laws to be published immediately , may succeed if cleverly conducted and continuously supported by Socialist as well as Radical ministers . French Rentes Strong Reflecting this sentiment , the Government Rentes were very strong throughout the Bourse session yesterday . The Perpetual Zie and the 41/2a of 1932 gained around three francs and with other governments finished at the day 's highs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Internationals , on the other hand , were irregular in spite of a rise in Sterling . In certain cases they closed below Friday 's levels and In no case reflected fully the higher price of the British currency . This was held to be due to doubts whether Sterling would be able to maintain itself for long above 130 francs . Yesterday it fluctuated violently in an extreme range of 130.50 francs to 132.80 . There were similar fluctuations in the dollar rate . ' These rapid changes , in which the French Stabilization Fund that a hand , provided a strong indication that under Finance Minister Bonnet the Fund is to ' May a much more active part than under his predecessor . This , as well as the expectation that he would embark on an open market policy embracing the capital and money markets , were given substance by M. Bonnet himself in an announcement he planned to exert special supervision over the market for Rentes . They also were accompanied by substantial rumors of a forthcoming change in the governorship of the Bank of France which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Bennett has publicly pledged the Cabinet not only to balance the ordinary budget but to cut extraordinary expenditures within limits required by non-recurring national defense outlays . Simultaneous declaration by Leon Blum , leader of the Socialist Party and former premier , that the Socialist Party is behind the neat government plainly indicates that if , as reported , there was acute dissension within the cabinet last week over Bonnet 's program , be has finally carried the day . Apart from the risks which the international situation always offers to the best laid financial plans in France , the main obstacle which the present experiment must surmount is discontent of Labor over sacrifices now demanded and the activity of Communist and other agitators whose interest lies in keeping that discontent alive . Labor Federation 's Demands Labor Leader Jouhaux has published the Labor Federation 's latest program which embraces temporary suspension of all statutory sinking fund repayments on long term public debt and utilization of the proceeds for consolidation of the floating debt . The Federation also demands an open market policy . reorganization of credit , control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and coal and important and vast public works scheme . The Federation admits , however , that the ordinary budget must first be balanced . Apparently the leaders of both Socialists and the workers are convinced of the necessity of fiscal sacrifices but there is some doubt whether they can carry their troops with them unless the sacrices are combined with skillful financial technique which will speedily produce improvement in the capital and money markets . It is this at which Bonnet 19 aiming  --  a rapid rise in Rentes , rapid revival of the money market and doubtless a fairly stable franc with a tendency to appreciate and thus to induce refugee funds to come home . French Franc Dips To Lowest Since 1926 Sterling hit a new high for the year , and French francs a new low since 1926 yesterday , as fresh capital flight from France and short selling in the franc testified to continued nervousness over the French outlookDhe wass  --  cdiscouraged by the failure of francs to'recover after week-end developments in Paris where political leaders joined in an effort to bring about a social truce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempted to halt the decline in francs in Paris early in the day , but withdrew when offerings became heavy . Withdrawal was followed by a technical rally but recovery was unable to hold and by the time New York opened the decline had started again and persisted throughout the session . Early morning cables showed a swing in Paris between a low of 3.73 ' . and 3.79 cents . The local market dropped to a new low at 3.7514 , cents for a loss of 1% points . It was suggested that there was official control in the local market at that level but this could not be vertified . With Paris buying sterling steadily , the rate was steady and firm here , scoring a new high for the year at $4.97% , for a gain of %-cent . Interest in the local market was centered about the franc but actual volume of business done in New York was stated to be small with the market extremely nervous . Wide fluctuations between sales were reported in Paris cables where there was a good volume of business done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
