txt The Loss of a Vote . To Me Editor of The New York Times Having lived and voted in Manhattan for more than twenty-five years , my wife and I find ourselves doprived of our votes , as we moved recently into Queens County . I consider the rule of thirty days ' residence in the election district a proper one , but why require four months ' residence in the county or a year in the State ? I did not leave New York City at all . I am still within its borders , but the fact that New York City is divided into so many counties deprives me of my vote . Years ago the moving time was mostly around May 1 , so a citizen moving at that time was qualified at election time , but since most people now move around Oct. 1 , the laws should be revised .
