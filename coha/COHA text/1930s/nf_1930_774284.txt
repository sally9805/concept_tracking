txt  | The same set of estimates and calculations is appropriate in judging the value of a property to its present owner . Generally speaking , a property is worth to its owner at least the net amount for which he can sell it ( i.e. , the amount to be received from the sale minus the disbursements incident to the sale ) . In other words , market value in the sense of the net price for which a property could actually be sold tends to place a lower limit on the value of a property to its owner . If the sole service of a property to its owner is to produce future net money receipts , an upper limit on the value of a property to its owner is generally placed by the excess of present worth of prospective receipts over prospective disbursements . If this present worth is less than the net price for which the property can be sold , it will ordinarily pay to sell the property . Other factors entering into the estimate of the value of a property to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the cost of replacement with an equally desirable substitute . The remainder of this chapter gives examples of the calculation of net present worth for three different types of income-producing property , as follows : 1 . A series of uniform annual payments for a limited number of years 2 . A perpetual series of uniform annual payments 3 . A government bond The general subject of the present worth aspects of valuation is explored further by a number of problems and examples throughout the remainder of this book . Valuation of Uniform Annual Series . It was shown in Plan III of Table 3 ? 1 that the present worth of $1,358.68 a year for 10 years was $10,000 with interest at 6% . The influence of interest rate on value may be observed if we consider the question of how much an investor would be willing to pay for the prospect of these payments if he required a 7% return on his investment . Here P = $1,358.68(P/A,7%,10) =$1,358.68-(7.024) = $9,543 . If he were satisfied with a 5% return , he would pay $1,358.68 ( P/A , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annual Series . As has already been pointed out in Chapter 5 , the present worth of a perpetual uniform annual series is the annual payment divided by the interest rate ; this stretches the definition of present worth to mean the investment that will provide ? as interest on it ? a desired annual payment forever . Whenever an investment is made where the termination of the income series at a definite time is not contemplated , valuation calculations are likely to be made on this basis . Thus , a stock paying an annual dividend  | of $6 would be valued at $120 on a 5% basis . The implications of such valuations should be recognized by those who make them ; it is unlikely that the corporation will continue its existence forever ? or that dividends will always be paid at exactly the present rate ? or that a given investor 's ownership of the stock will continue indefinitely . Consideration should be given to the question of whether or not the assumption of perpetuity is a fairly close approximation to what is anticipated , before using calculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with respect to comparisons of economy on the basis of capitalized cost , such as are described in this chapter . This limitation particularly applies to the determination of the investment that may be justified by a prospective annual saving . EXAMPLE 7-3 . VALUATION OF A BOND Expected Cash Flow . Most corporation bonds and many bonds issued by governments are promises to pay interest , usually semiannually , at a given rate , and to pay the principal of the bond at a definite future date . Consider a 3.5% , $10,000 government bond due after 25 years . This calls for a payment of $175 every six months during the 25-year period and a payment of $10,000 at the end of the 25 years . Assume that this bond is to be valued to yield a nominal 5% compounded semiannually . Calculation of Present Worth . Because this is a nominal rate and the interest period is half a year , present worths should be computed using an i of 2.5% , i.e. , half of 5% . The value of the bond is the sum of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as follows : figure This 5% is , of course , the before-tax yield to a buyer at this price ; we have not considered the effect of the bond ownership on his payments of income taxes . There are published bond value tables that give the relation between price and yield to the investor for bonds with various coupon rates and years to maturity . In the common case where such tables are available , calculations of the type illustrated in this example are unnecessary . Compound Amount Comparisons in Economy Studies . Money time series may be compared by converting them to equivalent single payments at some specified date ; the present usually is the most convenient date . With respect to economy studies regarding proposed investments , the " present " is usually the beginning of the period of time under consideration . An alternative possible date is the end of this period ; this  | requires compound amount conversions rather than present worth conversions . Although such compound amount comparisons are occasionally used in economy studies , the use of compound amount would seem to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , small changes in the interest rate have a deceptively large effect on the differences in compound amount . Hence the chances of misinterpretation of a compound amount study would seem much greater than the chances of misinterpretation of a study based on present worth . Summary . Valuation of prospective future series of net money receipts is a problem in present worth . In economy studies the comparison of estimated disbursements for alternative plans may be done by present worth conversions . If such comparisons are for a limited number of years of service , the present worth of the cost of the same number of years of service should be calculated for each alternative . When such comparisons are of the present worth of the cost of perpetual service , they are termed capitalized cost comparisons . The interest rate used in conversions for economy studies should be the rate of return required to justify an investment ; this applies to present worth conversions as well as to annual cost conversions . For various reasons , present worth comparisons in economy studies seem more difficult to interpret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which present worth comparisons seem particularly adapted , it is recommended that annual cost comparisons be preferred . PROBLEMS 7-1 . For a given pumping service for a regulated public utility , it is proposed to use either a 10-in. or a 12-in. pipe . The 10-in. pipe has a first cost of $4,500 and the annual pumping cost is estimated as $900 . The 12-in. pipe has a first cost of $6,000 and the annual pumping cost is estimated as $550 . The service will be required for 15 years ; no salvage value is expected for either pipe at the end of this period . Annual property taxes are estimated as 2% of first cost and annual income taxes as 3% of first cost . Compare the present worths of the cost of 15 years ' service , using an interest rate of 6% .

Annual property taxes are 2.5% of first cost and annual income taxes are 4.5% of first cost . Plan II requires an immediate investment of $20,000 which has a life of 20 years , a $2,000 salvage value at the end of the life , and annual maintenance cost of $1,600 . Tax rates are the same as in Plan I. This will be supplemented by an additional investment of $12,000 in 10 years .

A one-half capacity tunnel will be adequate for 20 years . A two-thirds capacity tunnel will be adequate for 35 years . Estimated construction costs are as follows : figure Extra pumping costs for the smaller size tunnels above costs for the full capacity tunnel are estimated as follows : One-third capacity tunnel , running full , $11,000 a year . Thus for an ultimate development of 3 such tunnels the extra pumping costs would be $33,000 a year . One-half capacity tunnel , running full , $10,000 a year . Thus for an ultimate development of 2 such tunnels the extra pumping costs would be $20,000 a year . Two-thirds capacity tunnel , running full , $8,000 a year . Thus for an ultimate development of 1 two-thirds and 1 one-third capacity the extra pumping costs would be $19,000 a year . Set up the four plans of development suggested by these estimates .

In certain types of projects , outright grants have been made to local governmental units for a portion of the construction cost of approved projects , with the remainder of the cost to be repaid by the local units with interest over a period of years . For example , a grant of 30% might be made , with the remaining 70% to be paid at interest over a 20-year period .

The XYZ Tile Co. secures its tile clay from property owned by John Doe , adjacent to the tile plant . Some years ago the company made a royalty contract with Doe on which it pays royalties of 50 cents per ton for all clay removed from his property . This contract has 5 years to run . It is estimated that Doe 's holdings will supply the company 's needs of 20,000 tons per year for the next 15 years before the clay is exhausted .

Costs of removing the clay would be substantially the same as from Doe 's holdings ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant would be greatly increased . Doe is aware of this fact ; it is believed that a new royalty contract ( 5 years hence ) for the final 10 years would need to provide a royalty rate of $1 per ton . At this royalty rate , it will continue to be advantageous to use Doe 's clay rather than the company 's more distant holdings . The president of the XYZ ' file Co. has just learned that Doe would consider an outright sale of his land to the company . By purchasing this land , the  | company would no longer have to pay royalty for the clay removed . It is believed that at the end of 15 years , when the clay is exhausted , the land can be sold for $10,000 . At what price for this property would the XYZ Co. have an investment that would yield 12% before income taxes as compared to the alternative of continuing to pay royalties ? 7 ? 20 .

A major overhaul will be required every 5 years at an estimated cost of $3,000 for each machine . Estimated costs of labor and labor extras are $8,000 a year for each machine . The automatic tape controlled machine consists of the basic machine and the tape control unit . The basic machine will cost $90,000 , have an estimated life of 20 years with a salvage value of $6,000 . Estimated annual maintenance and energy costs are $3,500 .

It is evident that the omission of interest by the government is , in effect , a subsidy to the farmer .

JoEL DEAN 1 Our examples in Chapters 6 and 7 started with the assumption of an interest rate or minimum attractive rate of return . Calculations were then made to provide a basis for judgment as to whether proposed investments would meet this standard . Often it is a good idea to compute the prospective rate of return on an investment rather than merely to find out whether the investment meets a given standard of attractiveness . Usually this calculation is carried out to best advantage by a trial-and-error method . Two or more interest rates are assumed , present worths or equivalent uniform annual cash flows are calculated , and the rate of return is found by interpolation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrowed , the circumstances are such that the cost of borrowed money ( expressed as an interest rate ) can not be found without similar trial-and-error calculations .

Our first example is of this type . It is followed by a number of examples dealing with prospective investments and prospective borrowings .

However , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Examples 8 ? 1 , 8 ? 2 , and 8 ? 4 ) , the analysis is for rate of return before income taxes . The reasons for the complications in such cases are discussed in Chapter 16 . All examples and problems involving the cost of borrowed money expressed as an interest rate deal with this cost before income taxes . EXAMPLE 8 ? 1 . RATE OF RETURN ON A PAST INVESTMENT Facts of the Case . This example relates to a completed 7-year period . Our assumed zero date is January of the first year when an investor purchased a residential rental property for $9,950 . As the investor immediately spent $950 for various improvements to the property , his total initial outlay was $10,900 . In late December at the end of the seventh year , the property was sold for a gross sales price of $22,000 . From this was deducted a 5% broker 's commission of $1,100 , leaving a net receipt from the sale of $20,900 . The second column of Table 8 ? 1 shows the receipts that occurred during the period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than income taxes ) , including maintenance costs , property taxes , and insurance . The fourth column combines these figures to give the year-by-year net cash flow before income taxes . Two lines are devoted to the final year ( year 7 ) , one showing the receipts and disbursements in connection with rentals and the other showing receipts and disbursements in connection with the sale of the property .  | Calculation of Rate of Return . The rate of return is the interest rate at which the present worth of the net cash flow is zero . Here this is the interest rate at which the present worth of the net receipts that occurred in years 1 to 7 is just equal to the $10,900 disbursement that was made at zero date . In the present worth calculations in Table 8 ? 2 , the end-of-year convention has been used . ( It will be recalled that this convention has been used throughout Chapters 6 and 7 . ) The cash flow figures for each year have been multiplied by the respective present worth factors for interest rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worths is +$2,145 at 15% and ? $605 at 20% . The following linear interpolation between these values indicates that this investment yielded a return of a little less than 19% before income taxes . Rate of return = 15% + $2,145 ( 20% ? 15% ) = 18.9% $2,750 EXAMPLE 8-2 . RATE OF RETURN ON A PROSPECTIVE INVESTMENT IN A RENTAL MACHINE Estimates Relative to a Proposed Investment . John Smith has received an inheritance of $12,000 . A friend engaged in the business of rental of construction machinery suggests that Smith invest this $12,000 in a tractor of a certain type . The friend will serve as Smith 's agent in the rental of this asset on a commission basis and will remit to Smith the net receipts from each year 's rentals at the end of the year . He estimates that for rental purposes the machine will have a useful life of 8 years , with a 10% final salvage value .

Table 8 ? 4 indicates that if the friend 's estimates of cash flow turn out to be correct , Smith 's return before income taxes will be 12% . In Table 8 ? 4 and in subsequent tables of this type , the present  | worth factors are omitted . In Table 8 ? 2 these factors were shown for each year and for each interest rate . In deciding whether or not to undertake this particular investment , Smith should compare the prospective return of 12% before income taxes with the prospective return before income taxes obtainable from alternative investments that he believes are of comparable risk . He must also decide whether he is willing to undertake the risks associated with this type of investment .  | EXAMPLE 8 ? 3 .

Of the $1,500,000 estimated investment in plant and equipment , $800,000 will have been spent one year before the plant starts to operate , and the remaining $700,000 in the year just preceding the start of operations . For purpose of analysis , the date of starting operations will be adopted as zero date on the time scale . It is estimated that the life of the plant will be 15 years from the date of the start of operation . ( It is believed the life will be terminated by product obsolescence . ) Throughout the period of operation , it is estimated that $200,000 will be invested in working capital , chiefly in the inventories of raw materials , work in process , and finished product , and in the excess of accounts receivable over accounts payable .

It is expected that there will be an initial 3-year period involving start-up costs and development of markets before the full earning power of the project is developed , and that there will be a period of declining earning power in the final 4 years .

( Although this might loosely be described as a present worth calculation at zero date , it will be noted that compound amount calculations are required for the conversions from years minus 1 and minus 2 . ) Interpolation between the sums of the equivalent amounts at zero date indicates a prospective after-tax return of slightly over 9.1% . This 9.1% interpolated figure is independent of the choice of reference date . That is , if present worths had been calculated at year minus 2 , or if compound amounts had been calculated at year 15 , the interpolated rate of return would still have turned out to be 9.1% . However , in systematic evaluation of a number of projects of this type , it seems reasonable that zero date should always be chosen as the date of start of operations . Chapter 21 illustrates industrial capital budgeting forms that are based on this assumption . The $300,0(R) land investment at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at ( late 0 have no effect on prospective taxable income or  | on income taxes because it is assumed that they will be recovered at date 15 without either increase or decrease . The tabulated cash flow at date 15 , both before and after taxes , includes the recovery of this total of $500,000 . If we had specified a minimum attractive after-tax rate of return of , say , 7% , this new-product proposal would clearly be acceptable . If we had specified , say , 15% , it would clearly be unacceptable . However , a common state of affairs in industry is for the available capital funds and other resources to be insufficient to permit accepting all the major investment proposals that seem likely to have fairly high rates of return . For this reason , decision making about such proposals is rarely quite as simple as reaching either a " Yes " or " No " decision by comparing a figure such as our 9.1% with a stipulated P. Chapters 11 , 13 , 14 , 18 , and 21 include comments on various aspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to the common need for capital rationing . Some Comments on Examples 8 ? 1 , 8 ? 2 , and 8 ? 3 . Example 8 ? 1 is an actual case with receipts and disbursements rounded off to multiples of $10 . Examples 8 ? 2 and 8-3 make use of assumed data with figures that were chosen to be useful in illustrating several different facets of engi-  | neering economy . From time to time throughout this book we shall refer to the data of these three examples to illustrate a number of matters . It will be noted that the method used for finding rate of return is the same in all examples , even though one deals with a past investment and the others with proposed investments . One aspect of these examples is that a single project constitutes a separate activity for which all receipts and disbursements are assumed to be identifiable . It is rarely true of the capital goods of modern industry that specific receipts can be identified with individual machines or structures . For example , the receipts from the sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , the factory building , or with a specific machine used in a sequence of operations , or with a specific item of materials handling equipment . In this particular respect these three examples are not typical of the usual rate-of-return analysis for purposes of decision making in industry . Subsequent examples throughout this book will continue to emphasize the point brought out in earlier chapters that it is the prospective differences in cash flow between alternatives that need to be forecast and analyzed as a basis for choosing between any given alternatives . Different Names Applied to the Computation of Rate of Return by the Methods Illustrated in This Chapter . Rate of return calculations of the type illustrated in Examples 8-1 , 8-2 , and 8 ? 3 are as old as writings on the mathematics of finance . Since the early 1950 's , however , the use of such calculations by industrial companies in the United States has greatly increased . Various names have been applied to this method of calculation . One name is the discounted cash flow method ; another is the Investor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been called the Profitability Index ( sometimes abbreviated to PI ) , interest rate of return , solving rate of return , and internal rate of return .2 Of the six phrases mentioned , " discounted cash flow " seems to be the one most widely used in industry . It describes the data required and the method of calculation illustrated in Tables 8-2 , 8-4 , and 8-5 . Cash flow refers to the fact that the required data must be given as the amounts and dates of receipts and disbursements . Discounted applies to the calculation of present worth . But the phrase " discounted cash flow " is properly applied to any calculation to find the present worth of cash flow whether or not the footnote 2 The phrase " discounted cash flow " is associated with the writings of Joel Dean . The phrase " Investor 's Method " ( usually capitalized ) is associated with the writings of Horace G. Hill , Jr. , and John C. Gregory . The phrase " Profitability Index " ( also usually capitalized ) is associated with the writings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return " is associated with the writings of J. B. Weaver and R. J. Reilly .  | calculation is to be used in computing a rate of return . Thus the phrase is applicable generally to present worth comparisons for economy studies ; it also applies to annual cost comparisons for which a finding of present worth has been an intermediate computational step . Moreover , the calculation of rates of return by correct methods often may be done without employing present worths ; frequently the use of equivalent uniform annual figures is equally satisfactory . Therefore it is misleading either to assume that a discounted cash flow calculation yields a rate of return or that a correct calculation of rate of return necessarily requires an analyst to discount cash flow . In general , the phrase " rate of return " used in this book means a rate found by applying appropriate compound interest analysis to past or prospective cash flow . There are a number of methods in common use in industry that give figures purporting to be rates of return . The most common of these methods are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give figures that differ widely from one another as well as from the rate that would be computed by correct compound interest techniques , the rates computed by these methods are referred to in Chapter 10 as " socalled rates of return . " Calculations such as were illustrated in Tables 8 ? 2 , 8 ? 4 , and 8 ? 5 require a fair amount of arithmetic ; it is necessary to multiply each year 's cash flow by the single payment present worth factor for two or more interest rates . Where uniform annual cash flows are involved , the arithmetic is somewhat simpler ; capital recovery factors or series present worth factors may be used . In some problems , calculations may be simplified by the use of gradient factors or gradient present worth factors . Where frequent trial-and-error calculations must be made to find unknown interest rates , and where a digital computer is available , it is a common practice to program the computer to make the trial-and-error solutions . The examples in the remainder of this chapter illustrate methods of computing unknown interest rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 , 8-2 , and 8 ? 3 . EXAMPLE 8 ? 4 . DETERMINING THE PROSPECTIVE RATE OF RETURN ON A BOND INVESTMENT Facts of the Case . A $10,000 3.5% government bond due in 25 years was described in Example 7-3 . This bond can be purchased for $8,140 . On the assumption that a buyer at this price will hold the bond to maturity , it is desired to find his before-tax rate of return . In acccordance with the usual practice in stating bond yields , this rate is to be expressed as a nominal interest rate assuming semiannual compounding .  | Calculation of Bond Yield . In Example 7 ? 3 , it was found that with a semiannual i of 2.5% , the present worth of the payments was $7,872 . A similar calculation using a semiannual i of 2% gives a present worth of $9,214 . Linear interpolation between these figures gives an i of 2.4% . The nominal rate per annum compounded semiannually is therefore 2(2.4%) = 4.8% . As explained in Example 7 ? 3 , the foregoing type of approximate calculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bond yields are available . EXAMPLE 8 ? 5 . DETERMINING THE PROSPECTIVE RATE OF RETURN FROM A UNIFORM ANNUAL SERIES OF NET RECEIPTS Data from Example 6-1 . The final column of Table 6 ? 1 ( page 71 ) showed that the differences in cash flow between Plans B and A consisted of a negative cash flow of $15,000 at zero date and positive after-tax cash flow of $2,800 a year for 10 years . Calculation of Rate of Return . The present worth of the net cash flow may be computed for various interest rates using the series present worth factors for 10 years . figure Interpolation indicates a rate of return of about 13.4% . In the special case where the prospective positive cash flow from an investment , P , constitutes a uniform annual series , A , an alternate solution is to compute P/A or A/P and to interpolate between the appropriate factors in the interest tables : In this instance , P/A = $15,000/$2,800 = 5.357 . Interpolation between 5.650 and 5.019 , the respective series present worth factors for 12% and 15% , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A comment on the use of the capital recovery factor in this type of calculation is made later in this chapter in connection with the discussion of the errors introduced by linear interpolation . EXAMPLE 8 ? 6 . PROSPECTIVE RATE OF RETURN // Data from Example 6 ? 2 . Plan B in Example 6 ? 2 had a first cost of $15,000 , annual disbursements of $6,400 , a 10-year life , and zero salvage value . Plan C had a first cost of $25,000 , annual disbursements of $5,750 , a 10-year life , and a $5,000 salvage value . ( The foregoing disbursements included extra income taxes as compared to Plan A. ) The difference in cash flow between C and B ( shown in the final column of Table 6-2 , page 76 ) was ? $10,000 initially , +$650 a year for 10 years , and +$5,000 at the end of 10 years . Calculation of Rate of Return . A calculation of present worth of the net difference in cash flow using 1%% and 2% interest indicates that the extra $10,000 investment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return of about 1.9%. figure  | In Example 8 ? 5 and in the foregoing calculation , we dealt only with the differences in cash flow between the two alternatives that were being compared . Of course the same conclusion is reached when present worths of all disbursements are computed for both alternatives . The following tabulation shows that the two alternatives have the same present worth at about 1.9%. figure The rate of return on extra investment must also be the interest rate at which the alternatives have the same equivalent uniform annual cost . The following tabulation shows that this occurs at about 1.9%. figure It will be noted that although the elements of cash flow common to Plans B and C have been included in the foregoing present worth and annual cost figures , it is only the differences in cash flow that have any influence on the conclusion regarding rate of return . The common elements of cash flow will contribute equally to the present worths ( or to the annual costs ) of both alternatives regardless of the interest rate assumed . A Possible Misinterpretation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Compared . It will be recalled that in Examples 6 ? 1 and 6-2 , Plan A was to continue the present method of carrying out a certain materials handling operation . Plan B required a $15,000 investment in equipment intended to reduce labor costs ; Plan C required a $25,000 investment in such equipment . The minimum attractive rate of return after income taxes was 8% . Plan B was favored by the annual cost comparison in Chapter 6 and by the present worth comparison in Chapter 7 . Our calculations of rate of return should also lead us to the conclusion that Plan B is the best of the three plans . The $15,000 investment in Plan B promises a 13.4% rate of return after income taxes as compared to the present method , Plan A. Because 13.4% is higher than our 8% standard , B is superior to A. On the other hand , the extra $10,000 investment required for Plan C will yield only 1.9% after income taxes as compared to B. Since 1.9% is less than our 8% standard , the $10,000 investment is not justified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i ? is selected for the comparison of alternatives , a correct analysis of relevant rates of return will invariably lead to the same conclusion that will be obtained from a correct annual cost comparison or a correct present worth comparison . Nevertheless , incorrect conclusions are sometimes reached by coni-  | puting rates of return from the wrong pairs of alternatives . For example , if Plan C is compared with Plan A , the prospective rate of return on the $25,000 investment is 8.4% after income taxes . Someone favoring Plan C might argue that because it promises 8.4% as compared to the present method of doing things and because 8.4% exceeds the stipulated i ? of 8% , the full $25,000 investment is justified . If Plan B were not available , it is true that the 8.4% rate of return would indicate the justification of Plan C. But because of the availability of B , C is unattractive . The $10,000 increment of investment in C over B will not pay its way , yielding only 1.9% after income taxes . In general , each separable increment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its justification . Unsound proposals often appear to be justified because they are improperly combined with sound ones from which they may be separated . The prospective return on Plan C as compared to Plan A has no useful meaning as a guide to decision making in this case . The viewpoint presented here is expanded in Chapter 12 which deals with comparisons of multiple alternatives . Demonstrating the Validity of a Rate of Return Computed by Compound Interest Methods . In our introductory discussion of compound interest in Chapter 3 , Table 3-1 illustrated four cases where an investment of $10,000 was recovered in 10 years with a return of 6% . The four cases involved four quite different series of year-end cash receipts by the investor of the original $10,000 . The figures in Table 3-1 showed the year-by-year unrecovered balances in each case and demonstrated that the four cases were alike in providing complete capital recovery of the original $10,000 with interest at 6% . Whenever correct compound interest methods are used to compute an unknown interest rate , a similar tabulation may be used to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be recalled that in Example 8-2 our discounted cash flow calculations indicated capital recovery with a return of 12% . Table 8-6 demonstrates the correctness of this 12% figure by year-by-year calculations of unrecovered balances assuming an interest rate of 12% . All but 59 cents of the initial $12,000 investment turns out to be recovered with 12% interest . Where someone questions the meaning of a computed rate of return , a tabulation such as Table 8-6 will sometimes help to clarify matters . Where persons are suspicious of compound interest methods and prefer some other " approximate " method of computing rate of return ( such as one of those discussed later in Chapter 10 ) , such a tabulation may be useful in demonstrating the correctness of the compound interest method and the incorrectness of the other methods .  | Rate of Return Calculations Assume the Termination of the Consequences of an Investment Decision . Example 8 ? 1 viewed an investment in retrospect : that is , it considered a past investment in incomeproducing property from the date of acquisition of the property until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money receipts and disbursements that were associated with this investment , it was possible to compute the rate of return obtained . Although Examples.8 ? 2 to 8 ? 6 dealt with prospective investments rather than with past ones , the viewpoint was really the same as in Example 8 ? 1 ; the transactions were viewed from the date of prospective acquisition to the prospective date of termination of ownership . Although an economy study regarding the desirability of a proposed investment may properly take the point of view of a terminated transaction , this viewpoint is hardly possible with regard to a past investment not yet terminated . For this reason , all judgments regarding profits or losses in business enterprises not yet terminated should really be thought of as preliminary estimates that in the long run may turn out to be either too favorable or not favorable enough . For example , the relatively high return of 18.9% in Example 8 ? 1 was caused by the sale of the rental property for approximately twice its cost ; if there had been accounts for this enterprise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the property was sold would have indicated a return of much less than 18.9% . Conclusions regarding the profitability of investments not yet terini-  | nated are usually drawn from the accounts of business enterprises . Some aspects of the difference in viewpoint between an economy study to determine whether or not to make a proposed investment and the accounting procedures relating to the same investment once it is actually made are explored in Chapter 10 . Chapters 6 and 7 explained that when alternatives deal with assets having different estimated lives , a convenient simple assumption is that replacement assets will repeat the cycle of disbursements and receipts that have been forecast for the initial asset . Example 8 ? 7 illustrates the use of this assumption in computing rate of return . EXAMPLE 8-7 . RATE OF RETURN CALCULATIONS WHEN ALTERNATIVES HAVE DIFFERENT LIVES Data from Example 6 ? 3 . It will be recalled that Plan D in Example 6 ? 3 had a first cost of $50,000 , a life of 20 years , a $10,000 terminal salvage value , and annual 0 &; M disbursements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a life of 40 years , a $20,000 terminal salvage value , annual 0 &; M disbursements of $6,000 , and extra annual income tax disbursements of $1,250 . These plans were compared in Chapters 6 and 7 by annual costs , present worths , and capitalized costs using an after-tax i ? of 8% . Calculation of Rate of Return . To compute a prospective rate of return on the $70,000 extra investment in Plan E , it is necessary that the two plans apply to service for the same number of years . Assume that the first 20 years ' estimated disbursements for Plan D will be repeated in the second 20 years as shown in the cash flow tabulation , Table 6 ? 3 ( page 79 ) . One way to find the rate of return on extra investment is to compute the present worths of the net disbursements for 40 years assuming different interest rates . Interpolation between the following differences in present worth shows that the two plans have the same present worth at about 2.7%. figure The same 2.7% rate of return is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net cash flow using different interest rates . Plan D Plan E Difference ( D ? E ) Equivalent annual cost at 2.5% $11,816 $11,734 +$82 Equivalent annual cost at 3% $11,989 $12,126 ? $137 Still another method , not illustrated here , would be to compute the capitalized costs of perpetual service using interest rates of 2.5% and 3% and to interpolate between the differences . Although any of the foregoing methods of solution will give the correct answer , the point that 2.7% is really the prospective rate of return on extra investment may be somewhat clearer if the problem is approached using only the differences in cash flow between the two plans . These differences were tabulated in the final column of Table 6 ? 3 ( page 79 ) . Plan E requires an extra disbursement of $70,000 at zero date , offset by reduced after-tax dis-  | bursements of $1,750 a year for 40 years and $40,000 at the end of the 20th year , and by an increased receipt of $10,000 from the larger salvage value at the end of the 40th year . Present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : figure Again interpolation gives us the 2.7% figure . If a year-by-year calculation should be made similar to Table 8 ? 6 , it would show that if a person invested $70,000 and as a result of this investment received $1,750 a year for 40 years plus single payments of $40,000 and $10,000 at the end of 20 and 40 years respectively he would recover his $70,000 with interest at approximately 2.7% . Guessing the Rate of Return Before a Trial-and-Error Calculation . In computing unknown rates of return by compound interest methods , it usually is necessary to compute present worths ( or equivalent uniform annual costs ) at two or more interest rates . The time needed for calculation will be minimized if the first interest rate tried is fairly close to the correct rate . Frequently a simple inspection of the cash flow series will tell whether to start by guessing a fairly low rate or a fairly high one . Where the cash flow series is irregular , it sometimes saves time to make a preliminary calculation before deciding on the first guessed rate . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be changed in a way that makes it possible to find the interest rate quickly with the help of interest tables . The following paragraphs illustrate how such preliminary calculations might have been made for the cash flow series of Examples 8 ? 1 and 8-2 . In Example 8 ? 1 most of the positive net cash flow is concentrated in the 7th or final year . A first guess might assume the entire amount , +$29,830 , in the 7th year . In effect , the cash flow series is changed so that a P of $10,900 leads to an F of $29,830 at the end of 7 years . The corresponding single payment present worth factor is then P F $10,900 - $29,830 = 0.365 . For n = 7 , P/F at 15% is 0.376 and P/F at 20% is 0.279 . If all the net positive cash flow had actually been concentrated in the 7th year , it is evident that the return would have been slightly over 15% . Because some of the net positive cash flow occurred in years 1 to 6 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tactics in this case would be to make the first trial at 20% ; the second trial could then be at either 15% or 25% , depending on the result of the first trial .  | In Example 8 ? 2 the net positive cash flow is not concentrated at the end of the period ; it is well distributed throughout the 8 years . Substitute a cash flow series with the same net positive cash flow spread uniformly over the 8 years . In such a series , A is $18,050 - 8 = $2,256 . The corresponding series present worth factor is then P = A = $12,000 = $2,256 = 5.32 . For n = 8 , P/A at 10% is 5.33 and P/A at 12% is 4.97 . With uniform cash flow the return would have been about 10% . Because there is more positive cash flow in the early years than in the later years , the return must be more than 10% . Good tactics in this case would be to make the first trial at 12% ; the second trial could then be at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first trial . Minor Errors Introduced by Linear Interpolation in Computing Rates of Return . Suppose that in Example 8 ? 2 we had computed the present worth of net cash flow only at 10% and 15% . The respective present worths at these rates , as shown in Table 8 4 , are +$746 and ? $985 . A linear interpolation between these figures is as follows : Estimated rate of return = 10% + 1,7 746 31 ( 15% ? 10% ) = 12.2% We already know from Example 8 ? 2 that the return is 12% . It is evident that the foregoing interpolated value is a little too high . It is obvious that all such relationships between interest rate and present worth must be curvilinear . Where present worths have been computed for interest rates separated by 0.5% ( such as the 2.5% and 3% rates in Example 8-7 ) , the possible error from linear interpolation is relatively small . This error naturally can be larger where present worths are computed for rates separated by 5% ( such as the 15% and 20% rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from linear interpolation is greatest when the rate of return is midway between the two interest rates used in the calculation . Some analysts use graphical methods in finding unknown rates of return . In order to show the curvature of the present worth curve , graphical methods usually require calculation of present worths assuming three or more interest rates . In this book the practice is to use linear interpolation and to state the interpolated rates of return to the nearest tenth of a per cent . Advantages of linear interpolation are that the calculation can be made quickly by slide rule and that present worths need be calculated at only two interest rates . Analysts should recognize that linear interpolation sometimes causes an error in the rate of return of one or two tenths of a per cent .  | In general , the calculations of rates of return in economy studies are made to influence decisions among alternatives . The errors introduced by a linear interpolation in any compound interest method are usually so small as to have no appreciable influence on the decision making . The errors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present worth methods usually tend to give computed rates of return a little above the true rate . In contrast , the errors , if any , introduced by linear interpolation in annual cost methods usually tend to give computed rates of return slightly below the true rate . This point is illustrated by the following simple example . Consider a $10,000 investment that is expected to result in an end-of-year net positive cash flow of $1,259 a year for 12 years . P is $10,000 ; A is $1,259 . Therefore the series present worth factor is P ? A = 7.943 , and the capital recovery factor is A - P = 0.12590 . It can be seen from the 7% table that the return is exactly 7% . But assume that no 7% table is available and that it is necessary to interpolate between figures from 6% and 8% tables . In these tables the series present worth factors are 8.384 and 7.536 respectively ; a linear interpolation to hundredths of a per cent indicates a return of 7.04% . The capital recovery factors are 0.11928 and 0.13270 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , if interpolated values had been stated only to the nearest tenth of a per cent , both methods would have given 7.0% , the correct figure . Use of Interest Tables Based on Continuous Compounding in Computing Unknown Rates of Return . The end-of-year convention in economy studies was explained in Chapter 6 . This convention has been employed in the calculations of rates of return in the present chapter and is used in such calculations throughout the main body of this book . In some economy studies in industry , a different convention is used ; it is assumed that all prospective receipts and disbursements during each year will occur uniformly throughout that year . To use this alternate convention , it is necessary to assume continuous compounding of interest ( explained in Chapter 4 ) and to have interest tables based on continuous compounding and on the uniform flow of funds throughout each year . Tables E ? 28 and E ? 29 ( in Appendix E ) are such tables . Their use in connection with rate of return calculations is explained in Appendix A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convention may be preferable to the end-of-year convention . Rate of Return from a Combination of Two Separable Proposed Investments That Have Different Prospective Rates of Return . A certain mining property is for sale for $1,500,000 . The engineer for the prospective purchaser estimates the remaining life of the mine as 8 years .  | For each of these years he estimates that the excess of receipts over disbursements will be $391,000 . He desires to compute the prospective rate of return . In mining enterprises there is a traditional method of determining rate of return known as Hoskold 's method . In this method it is assumed that uniform annual deposits will be made into a conservatively invested sinking fund that will earn interest at a relatively low rate . The annual deposits are to be just sufficient to replace the original investment at the end of the life of the property . The rate of return is computed by dividing the investment into the annual amount remaining after setting aside the sinking fund deposit . To illustrate Hoskold 's method , assume 4% interest on the sinking fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of 8 years is $1,500,000 ( A/F , 4%,8 ) = $1,500,000 ( 0.10853 ) = $162,800 . The annual cash remaining for the owners of the property after they have made the sinking fund deposit will be $391,000 ? $162,800 = $228,200 . As $228,200 = $1,500,000 = 0.152 , this project is viewed as one promising a 15.2% return . If the same proposal is analyzed by correct compound interest methods , the computed rate of return is 20% ; $391,000 ( P/A , 20%,8 ) = $391,000 ( 3.837 ) = $1,500,000 . The difference between the viewpoints underlying these 15.2% and 20.0% figures deserves some comment here , particularly because the viewpoint leading to the 15.2% figure is by no means restricted to the mineral industries . If the purchaser of the mining property actually makes the two investments contemplated in the 15.2% calculation and if receipts and disbursements turn out as forecast , it is true that his combined rate of return will be 15.2% . From the combination of the two investments he will have a cash flow of ? $1,500,000 at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and +$1,500,000 at the end of the 8th year . The important point to recognize here is that this 15.2% return is the result of two separate investments , one yielding 20% and the other yielding only 4% . Presumably the decision to make the investment with the 20% yield does not require that there also be a decision to make the 4% investment . If not , the 4% investment has no relevance in making the decision about the proposed investment with the 20% yield . It is the 20% figure , not the 15.2% one , that should be used as the index of attractiveness of the proposed investment in the mining property . This Hoskold-type viewpoint on computing rate of return is rarely , if ever , appropriate as a basis for decision making on proposed investments . It seems particularly indefensible in the common case where it is used when no actual sinking fund is contemplated . Further comment on this topic is made in Appendix C.  | Determining the True Cost of Borrowed Money . In finding the true interest rate paid by a corporation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are similar to those indicated for computing rate of return on a bond investment . However , it is necessary to recognize that borrowing causes the corporation to make certain disbursements that are not receipts to the bond investor . For instance , a $10,000,000 bond issue of 4.5% , 20-year bonds that was sold by investment bankers to the ultimate investor at 95 ( i.e. , $950 per $1,000 bond ) might have been sold by the issuing corporation to an investment banking syndicate at 91% . Thus the corporation would receive $9,150,000 for its promise to pay $450,000 a year for 20 years and $10,000,000 at the end of that time . These payments would repay the amount received with interest at about 5.2% . If the initial expenses to the corporation in connection with the bond issue were $200,000 ( for such items as engraving bonds , preparing a registration statement for the Securities and Exchange Commission , accounting and legal expenses in connection with the issue ) , and if the annual disbursements involved in fees for registrar and trustee , costs of making interest payments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this borrowed money would be even greater . The corporation is really receiving a net sum of $8,950,000 now in exchange for an obligation to pay $480,000 a year for 20 years and $10,000,000 2 years hence . Present worth calculations and interpolation indicate that the true cost of this borrowed money is about 5.7% . Thus a given loan may appear to have different interest rates , depending on the point of view . In this illustration the coupon rate on the bonds was 4.5% ; the yield to the bond investors was 4.9% ; the bonds were sold by the corporation to the investment bankers at a price giving a yield of 5.2% ; considering the cost incidental to the borrowing of money , the actual cost of money to the corporation was 5.7% . The foregoing analysis disregards income tax considerations . The usual result of income taxation in the United States is ? in effect ? to reduce the cost of borrowing money to private borrowers below a figure obtained from the foregoing type of calculation . Certain aspects of the relationship between income taxes and borrowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Always What They Seem . There are many situations in which a superficial examination of the facts may lead to an underestimate of the interest rate being paid by a borrower . One such situation has just been described . Another was described in Chapter 5 in which a " Seven Per Cent Plan " turned out to involve an interest rate of nearly 14% per annum . Another such situation exists whenever , in a purchase of a property  | " on terms , " there is a difference between the selling price to a cash buyer and one to a buyer who agrees to pay the purchase price in periodic installments with interest . For instance , a residential property is for sale for $24,000 under the following arrangements : $4,000 cash and the balance of $20,000 to be repaid with interest at 7% in uniform installments for 15 years . Investigation discloses that a buyer on these terms must also pay $600 immediately for various expenses incidental to securing the loan . It also appears that the same property can be purchased for $21,000 cash . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform annual payments rather than monthly payments as would customarily be required . The uniform payment , A , to repay a P of $20,000 , with i = 0.07 and n = 15 , is $20,000(0.10979) $2,196 . It is evident that a buyer for cash will pay $21,000 at once and thus conclude the transaction . A buyer on borrowed money will pay out $4,600 at once and $2,196 a year for 15 years . This $2,196 a year is clearly an alternative to a $16,400 immediate cash payment ; if the buyer had the $16,400 he could substitute it for the promise to pay $2,196 a year for 15 years . To find the real cost of borrowed money to him , it is necessary to find the interest rate at which his annual payments for 15 years would repay $16,400 . As A/P = $2,196/$16,400 = 0.1339 , interpolation between the capital recovery factors for 10% and 12% shows this interest rate to be approximately 10.3% . The difference between the apparent 7% interest and the actual 10.3% interest paid by the buyer on credit was concealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the initial charges incident to the loan . Certain Cases in Which Two or More Solutions Are Possible in Computing an Unknown Interest Rate . Some proposals involving estimated prospective cash flows combine one or more periods of time that are , in effect , investment periods with one or more periods of time that are , in effect , borrowing or financing periods . Proposals of this type occur from time to time in the production operations of the petroleum industry and occasionally in other industries . They may be identified by the fact that the series of estimated cash flows has two or more reversals of sign . This chapter has illustrated conventional types of trial-and-error calculations to find an unknown interest rate . Such calculations are appropriate for the common types of proposals that are solely investment or solely borrowing/financing . In an investment-type proposal , an initial negative cash flow is succeeded by one or more prospective positive cash flows . In a borrowing/financing-type proposal , an initial positive cash  | flow is succeeded by one or more prospective negative cash flows . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more reversals of sign , such conventional calculations may give two or more values for the " solving " interest rate or , sometimes , no values at all . In such mixed proposals , misleading conclusions often will be reached from any conventional type of compound interest analysis , whether the analysis is based on net present worth , equivalent uniform annual cash flow , or the calculation of an unknown interest rate or rate of return . This subject is explored in Appendix B. In that appendix it is explained that the key to an analysis of a mixed proposal that is primarily an investment proposal is the use of an auxiliary interest rate during the borrowing or financing period . For a proposal that is primarily a borrowing or financing proposal , the key is using an auxiliary interest rate during the investment period . It also is explained that in many cases , the conclusions of an analysis are relatively insensitive to large changes in the value of the assumed auxiliary interest rate ; in such cases it usually is good enough for practical purposes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow series being analyzed has two or more reversals of sign . Another Meaning for " Rate of Return on Investment . " Throughout this book , the phrase " rate of return on investment " is used in the meaning illustrated in this chapter , as the rate of " interest " at which an investment is repaid by an increase in net cash receipts . However , it should be pointed out that another meaning is sometimes given to this phrase . In this other use , " rate of return " is taken to mean the excess of the return over the current interest rate on borrowed capital , or the excess of the return over the going interest rate on conservative investments . A return described in this book as 9% would be described as a 3% return in a case where the going rate of interest was assumed to be 6% . This other meaning for " rate of return " corresponds somewhat to the economic theorist 's concept of " profit , " just as the meaning adopted in this book corresponds more closely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a possible one , but it is obvious that both can not be used without confusion . The meaning used here has been chosen because it seems better adapted to practical business situations . Thus , wherever " rate of return " is used throughout these pages , it means a figure to be compared with the interest obtainable on investments elsewhere , rather than a figure in excess of such interest . Summary . A comparison between alternatives involving money payments and receipts of different amounts at different dates may be expressed by an interest rate , the rate that makes the two alternatives  | equivalent . When one alternative involves a higher present investment and higher future net receipts ( possibly as a result of lower future disbursements ) , this interest rate may be called the prospective rate of return on the extra investment . Its calculation provides one of the several methods of determining in an economy study whether a proposed investment will be recovered with a return commensurate with the risk ? in other words , one of the methods of considering the time value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized by an investor from an investment can not be determined until his association with the investment has terminated ; it may differ substantially from the apparent rate of return at some intermediate period . The viewpoint of an engineering economy study for a proposed investment , involving , as it does , estimates for the full expected economic life of a machine or structure , implies calculations of rate of return of the same type as would be required to judge the actual return realized from terminated investments . In a loan transaction the true cost of money to the borrower , which should be obtained by viewing the transaction as the difference between the net present cash provided by the borrowing and the future money outlays that the borrowing necessitates , will often be much greater than the apparent or contract rate of interest .

" " Why now ? " " Why this way ? " These questions are just as relevant in government as in private enterprise . The basic procedures in decision making about proposed governmental outlays for fixed assets ought to be the same as in proposed outlays in private business , namely : 1 . Define alternatives clearly and try to determine the differences in consequences of various alternatives . 2 . Insofar as practicable , make these differences commensurable by expressing them in terms of money . 3 . Apply some criterion to the monetary figures to provide a basis for judgment whether proposed investments are justified . The time value of money should be recognized in establishing this criterion . 4 . Choose among alternatives applying the foregoing criterion but also giving consideration to the differences among alternatives that were not reduced to money terms . 1 United States Code , 1940 ed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , p. 2964. 135  | Economic Evaluation of Proposed Public Works in Terms of " Benefits " and " Costs . " In the famous passage quoted at the start of this chapter , the United States Flood Control Act of 1936 stipulated that " benefits to whomsoever they may accrue " should exceed " estimated costs . " Although this phrasing of a primary criterion for project evaluation applied officially only to flood control projects in the United States that were to be financed entirely or partially by the federal government , the phrasing gradually was adopted in the economic evaluation of various other types of federal public works projects . Then , as time went on , it was also applied to the evaluation of many proposed local public works projects within the United States . During the 1950 's and 1960 's , the same type of formulation of project evaluation standards was introduced in many other countries throughout the world . Some Difficulties in Identifying and Measuring Relevant Consequences in Economy Studies for Proposed Government Projects . Conceptually , matters are more complicated in evaluating proposed public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also , the application of concepts is more difficult where governmental activity is involved . Certain differences between economy studies for private enterprise and economy studies for governments may be illustrated by contrasting the evaluation of a proposed relocation of a portion of a privately owned railway with the evaluation of a proposed relocation of a section of highway . In both cases an economic evaluation calls for consideration of the required investment and of the influence of the project on roadway maintenance costs and on the costs associated with the movement of traffic . But there is an important point of difference . The railway company makes the investment and expects itself to recover the investment plus an adequate return through savings in costs of moving traffic and , in some cases , also through increased revenues and/or reduced maintenance costs . In contrast , although governmental agencies make the investment and pay highway maintenance costs , the savings in costs of moving traffic are made by the general public , not by any government agency . Therefore , the answer to the question " Whose viewpoint should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are similar . Clearly , the difficulty in estimating and valuing consequences is much less for the railway project than for the highway project . Moreover , in looking at the railway decision from the viewpoint of the company 's owners , an economy study can be based on cash flow , i.e. , on receipts and disbursements by the railway company . In contrast , when one looks at the highway decision from the viewpoint of consequences " to whomsoever they may accrue , " it is not practicable to look  | at all cash flows . If one considers the entire population , every positive cash flow ( receipt ) by someone is a negative cash flow ( disbursement ) by someone else . Therefore , the algebraic sum of the cash flows would be zero and there would be no basis for an economic evaluation . For example , if a project is expected to reduce highway accidents , there will be reduced disbursements by highway users for automobile repairs , medical and hospital services , and legal services . But the reduction in these outlays by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receipts by the automobile repair shops , physicians , hospitals , and lawyers . The foregoing illustration brings out the point that it becomes necessary in the economic analysis of a public works project to make a judgment as to which consequences are to be counted and which are to be disregarded . In the case of a proposed reduction in highway accidents , this judgment is not a difficult one . From the public viewpoint , highway accidents are deemed to be undesirable ; one of the purposes of a proposed highway improvement may be to reduce them . When we take a more critical look at the subject in Chapter 19 , we shall see that it is difficult to get a fully satisfactory monetary evaluation of all their adverse consequences . Nevertheless , a way to start such an evaluation is to estimate the reduction in monetary outlays by accident victims associated with a prospective reduction in the number and severity of highway accidents . Such a monetary saving is reasonably counted as a project benefit . The prospective reduction in receipts by repair shops , physicians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; such consequences should not be included as " negative benefits " or " disbenefits " or " costs " of a proposed highway project . Purpose of This Chapter . Although most persons would doubtless agree that the foregoing reasoning is acceptable in the evaluation of highway accident reduction , decisions separating consequences considered to be relevant in an economy study from consequences considered to be irrelevant are not always so clear and noncontroversial . Chapter 19 deals with economy studies for governmental activities . We shall put off until that chapter our discussion of a number of conceptual issues and practical difficulties involved in identifying relevant benefits and costs and placing money values on them . In examples and problems before Chapter 19 we shall assume that suitable year-by-year money figures have been obtained to measure the relevant benefits and costs . The objective of the present chapter is to show the relationship between the various benefit-cost techniques and the methods of analysis that have already been explained . We shall see that with the same input data ( including of course a stipulated minimum attractive rate of  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs is the same decision that will be reached by the methods explained in Chapters 6 , 7 , and 8 . However , we shall also see that the same proposed project may have several different values of the benefit-cost ratio depending on whether certain adverse items are subtracted from benefits or added to costs . Both of the examples in this chapter involve three alternatives , one of which is a continuation of a present condition . Examples and problems involving more than three alternatives are introduced in Chapter 12 . Importance of the Interest Rate Selected in Economy Studies for Governments . Various names have been applied to the value of i ? used in the economic analysis of proposed public works . Whether this is called an imputed interest rate , a discount rate , a vestcharge , or given some other name , it is , in effect , the chosen minimum attractive rate of return . Moreover , even though the primary criterion for decision making may be phrased in terms of benefits and costs , it is the chosen value of i ? that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion of the issues involved in selecting i ? in governmental economy studies is deferred until Chapter 19 . The two examples in this chapter assume values of 7% and 6% , respectively . EXAMPLE 9-1 . APPLICATION OF SEVERAL METHODS OF ANALYSIS TO A SIMPLE HIGHWAY ECONOMY STUDY Facts and Estimates . A certain stretch of rural highway is in such bad condition that its resurfacing or relocation is required . The present location is designated as H ; two possible new locations that will shorten the distance between the terminal points are designated as J and K. Location K is somewhat shorter than J but involves a considerably higher investment for grading and structures . An economy study comparing the proposals for the three locations is to use a study period of 20 years and an i ? of 7% . The estimated initial investment to be made by government highway agencies would be $110,000 at location H , $700,000 at J , and $1,300,000 at K. If location H is abandoned now , it will have no net salvage value ; also it is assumed to have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location is kept in service . However , because the estimated useful lives of the works that would be constructed at J or K are longer than the 20-year analysis period , residual values are estimated at the end of 20 years . These are $300,000 for J and $550,000 for K. Estimated annual maintenance costs , also to be paid by the government , are $35,000 for location H , $21,000 for J , and $17,000 for K. It is forecast that the traffic on this section of highway will increase by a uniform amount each year until year 10 and will then continue at a constant level until year 20 . It is not expected that the volume of traffic will be influenced by this decision on the location of the highway . For location 11 , annual road user costs deemed to be relevant in the economic analysis are estimated as $210,000 in year 1 , $220,000 in year 2 , and increasing by $10,000  | each year until they reach $300,000 in the 10th year ; thereafter they will continue at $300,000 . For location J , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 1 , an increase of $7,500 a year until year 10 , and a constant annual figure of $225,000 thereafter . For the even shorter location K , the corresponding figures are $136,500 , $6,500 , and $195,000 . There are no differences in nonuser consequences that need to be considered . Comparison of Present Worths of Relevant Costs . A tabulation of the present worths of the foregoing costs using an i ? of 7% is given in Table 9-1 . This tabulation does not separate the capital and maintenance costs paid by the government from the road user costs paid by the general public . It is evident that location J has the lowest total present worth . // figure Table 9 ? 2 shows a comparison of the equivalent uniform annual figures using an i ? of 7% . Of course the three totals are in the same proportions to one another as the present worths totals in Table 9 ? 1 ; in fact , each total annual cost figure is the product of total present worth and 0.09439 , the of for 7% and 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Extra Investments . Trial and error calculations of the type illustrated in Chapter 8 will show that , as compared to location H , the extra investment in location J will yield a prospective rate of return of approximately 12.8% . That is , the prospective savings in maintenance costs and road user costs plus the greater residual value are just sufficient to recover the extra $590,000 initial outlay with an interest rate of 12.8% . Because 12.8% exceeds the stipulated i ? of 7% , location J is economically superior to location H. Similar calculations comparing K with J will show that the extra investment in K over J has a prospective rate of return of approximately 3% . Because 3% is less than the stipulated i ? of 7% , the extra investment of $600,000 needed for K is not economically justified . Of course , the rate-of-return analysis  | reaches the same conclusion as the present worth analysis and the annual cost analysis ; it favors J as compared to H or K. Calculation of the Excess of Benefits over Costs . In the solutions given in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving in road user costs ( a favorable consequence to road users ) is classified as a " benefit " and that the initial investment and the annual outlay for maintenance ( both paid by the government ) are classified as " costs . " An analysis comparing benefits with costs can be made using either present worths or equivalent uniform annual figures . Using present worths and designating benefits by B and costs by C : figure The foregoing differences of course are the same differences in total present worths that could have been calculated from Table 9-1 . Naturally , the conclusion is favorable to location J just as in Table 9-1 . Using equivalent annual figures : figure Here we have the same differences that could have been computed from the three totals in Table 9-2 . Calculation of Benefit-Cost Ratios . The reader will recall that the 1936 flood control act quoted at the start of this chapter merely stated that benefits should exceed costs . Nevertheless , analysts who compare benefits with costs nearly always compute a ratio of benefits to costs . The stipulation B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The B/C ratios in this example will of course be the same whether they are computed from present worths or from equivalent uniform annual figures . To compare J with H , figure  | To compare K with J , figure Like all the other types of analysis that have been illustrated , the analysis using the B/C ratios favors location J. However , later in this chapter we shall see that the same input data can give different values of the B/C ratio depending on whether certain items are viewed as affecting the numerator or the denominator of the B/C fraction . EXAMPLE 9 ? 2 . BENEFIT-COST ANALYSIS OF FLOOD CONTROL ALTERNATIVES Facts and Estimates . Just before Willow Creek has its outlet into a salt water bay , it goes through an urban area . Because there have been occasional floods that have caused damage to property in this area , a flood control project has been proposed . Estimates have been made for two alternative designs , one involving channel improvement ( CI ) and the other involving a dam and reservoir ( D &; R @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated 50-year project life assuming zero terminal salvage value and using an i ? of 6% . The " expected value " of the annual cost due to flood damages is $480,000 with a continuation of the present condition of no flood control ( NFC ) . The alternative CI will reduce this figure to $105,000 ; the alternative D &; R will reduce it to $55,000 . ( Obviously , some years will have no flood damage ; other years may have considerable damage . It is not possible to predict the specific dates of the years that will have the severe floods ; the best that can be done is to predict the long-run relative frequencies of flood magnitudes and their related damages . The " expected value " is obtained from such estimates by the use of the mathematics of probability ; methods of computation are illustrated in Chapter 14 . In that chapter we shall see why it is reasonable in this type of economic analysis to treat the respective figures of $480,000 , $105,000 , and $55,000 as if they were uniform annual figures . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and estimated annual maintenance costs of $35,000 . Both of these require disbursements by the government . The D &; R alternative has an estimated first cost of $5,300,000 , and estimated annual operation and maintenance costs of $40,000 , both requiring disbursements by the government . This alternative also has two types of adverse consequences related to the conservation of natural resources . These are to be treated in the economic analysis as disbenefits ( sometimes called " negative benefits " or " malefits " ) . The dam will cause a damage to anadromous fisheries ; this is priced at $28,000 a year . The reservoir will cause a loss of land for agricultural purposes including grazing and crop raising ; this is priced at $10,000 a year . Benefit-Cost Analysis . Example 9 ? 1 made the point that it was possible to use equivalent uniform annual figures in a benefit-cost analysis . Because most of the estimates in the present example consist of annual figures , our analysis will he based on annual benefits and annual costs . In comparing the alternative of channel improvement ( CI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flood control ( NFC ) , the annual bene-  | fits are due to the reduction in the expected value of flood damages . The annual costs are the annual capital recovery costs and maintenance costs of CI . figure In comparing the dam and reservoir ( D &; R ) with channel improvement , the extra annual benefit is the further reduction in the expected value of flood damages minus the disbenefits associated with the loss of fisheries and agricultural resources . The extra annual cost is the extra capital recovery cost due to the greater investment plus the extra annual operation and maintenance cost . figure With the given input data associated with a criterion stated either as B ? C 0 or B/C 1 , it is evident that channel improvement is economically justified whereas the proposed dam and reservoir are not economically justified . The Fallacy of Merely Comparing All Proposals for Change with a Continuation of a Present Condition . In both of the foregoing examples , one alternative was to continue a present condition ( location H in 9 ? 1 and no flood control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Location j was economically superior to both locations H and K. Similarly in Example 9 ? 2 , channel improvement was economically superior both to no flood control and to the proposed darn and reservoir . Nevertheless , the higher investments required for location K and for the dam and reservoir would have appeared to be justified if comparison had been made only with a continuation of the present condition . If K should be compared to H , the B/C ratio would be 1.15 . If D &; R should be compared with NFC , the B/C ratio would be 1.03 . It should be clear to the reader that where there are more than two alternatives , it is never sufficient to compare a proposed alternative only with the least attractive of the remaining alternatives . This is elaborated in Chapter 12 and discussed further in some of the later chapters . The Arbitrary Aspects of the Classification of Certain Items in a Benefit-Cost Analysis . The present-worth and annual-cost solutions in Example 9 ? 1 treated all input data as affecting costs ; road user costs  | were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs . Subsequently , in the solutions using benefits and costs , reductions in road user costs were classified as benefits . The capital recovery cost of the highway investment and the highway maintenance cost were classified as costs . In the D &; R alternative in Example 9 ? 2 , the adverse consequences associated with the loss of certain natural resources were classified as disbenefits . Our practice in the benefit-cost analyses in these two examples was consistent with a rule that relevant consequences to the general public should be classified as benefits or disbenefits and that consequences involving disbursements by governmental units should be classified as costs . However , such a rule of classification is entirely arbitrary ; different rules are used by different analysts . For example , annual maintenance costs are sometimes deducted from benefits rather than added to costs . Certain adverse consequences to the general public ( such as the loss of natural resources in Example 9 ? 2 ) are sometimes added to costs rather than treated as disbenefits . The Influence on the Benefit-Cost Ratio of the Decision on Whether Certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a deficiency of the benefit-cost ratio as a scheme of project evaluation that legislators , administrative officials , and concerned members of the general public often have the view that the higher the ratio the better the project and vice versa . Actually , although ( B ? C ) is unaffected by the decision as to whether an item is classified as a cost or as a disbenefit , the ratio B/C can be considerably influenced by this arbitrary decision . For example , consider a project that has $300,000 of benefits , $100,000 of costs , and a $90,000 adverse item that some analysts would classify as a cost and others would classify as a disbenefit . If this $90,000 item should be classified as a cost : figure With either classification , ( B ? C ) = $110,000 . The real merits of the project are unrelated to the classification of the $90,000 adverse item . However , to an uncritical observer the apparent merits of the project tnay be greatly influenced by this classification .  | Some General Comments on the Subject Matter of This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise , valid economy studies can be made without using the word " benefits . " In fact , we illustrated such studies in Chapters 6 and 7 ( Examples 6 ? 4 and 7 ? 2 ) . Moreover , even in Example 9 ? 1 we noted that present worth , annual cost and rate of return analyses gave the same conclusion yielded by the benefit-cost analysis . It is not necessary or desirable to phrase decision criteria in terms of benefits and costs in the economic evaluation of all proposed governmental investments . The authors of this book have observed that the attempt sometimes made to formulate the economic analysis of all government projects in terms of so-called benefits and costs has occasionally been an obstacle to sound thinking . In cases where all the relevant differences expressed in monetary terms can be described as estimated cash flows by a governmental body , as was the case in Examples 6 ? 4 and 7 ? 2 , there is no good reason for a benefit-cost type of formulation . The special useful concept emphasized by a formulation using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospective consequences " to whomsoever they may accrue . " It was pointed out near the start of this chapter that we are putting off until Chapter 19 our discussion of certain troublesome and controversial matters that often arise in the evaluation of public works proposals . Among these matters are the choice of a minimum attractive rate of return , the selection of a method for placing a money valuation on consequences to the general public , and the decision as to which prospective consequences to the public are deemed to be relevant in any given economic evaluation . In that chapter , also , we shall take a brief look at certain institutional factors that sometimes create obstacles to sound decision making in the public sector of the economy . PROBLEMS 9 ? 1 . Example 9 ? 1 followed the practice , which has been fairly common in highway economy studies , of classifying highway maintenance expenditures as " costs " in computing B/C ratios . The respective B/C ratios for locations J over H , K over J , and K over H , were 1.94 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlays for maintenance ought to be classed as disbenefits . Compute the three B/C ratios making this change in classification . ( Ans. = 1.67 ; 0.61 ; 1.13. ) 9 ? 2 . In Example 9 ? 2 , the $38,000 a year figure for the prospective loss of natural resources that would be caused by the D &; R project was classed as a disbenefit . The respective B/C ratios for D &; R as compared to CI and NFC were 0.08 and 1.03 . What would these B/C ratios have been if the loss of natural resources had been classified as a cost rather than as a dis benefit ? ( Ans. ? 0.26 ; 1.03. )  | 9 ? 3 . Make the necessary calculations to check the present worth figures given in Table 9-1. 9 ? 4 . Make the necessary calculations to check the annual cost figures given in Table 9-2 . ( Do not use the present worth figures from Table 9-1. ) 9 ? 5 . Example 9 ? 1 states that location J shows a prospective rate of return of approximately 12.8% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prospective rate of return of approximately 3% as compared to location J. Make the necessary calculations to check these stated rates of return . 9 ? 6 . In Example 9 ? 2 , what is the prospective rate of return on the extra investment in CI as compared to NFC ? What is the prospective rate of return on the extra investment in D &; R as compared to CI ? 9 ? 7 . A study is made to determine the most economical traffic control method for an isolated intersection of two city streets , Doe Street and Roe Avenue . Three types of control are considered for analysis : R. A continuation of the present condition in which stop signs require all traffic from Roe Avenue to stop before entering Doe Street S. The installation of stop signs on Doe Street to convert the intersection into a 4-way stop T. The installation of 2-phase fixed time signals The new investment required by the city would be $100 for S and $9,450 for T. All investments are considered to have a 10-year life with negligible net salvage value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city are estimated as $25 for R , $50 for S , and $1,270 for T. There is no evidence that there will be any difference in police department costs or other municipal disbursements . Differences in costs of road user consequences that the analyst deems to be relevant in an economic analysis are : 1 . Extra costs of motor vehicle operation due to required motor vehicle stops at the intersection 2 . Extra costs of the time of commercial vehicle traffic due to vehicles stopping or slowing down at the intersection 3 . Costs associated with accidents For the expected volume of traffic at this intersection and for actual vehicle speeds , and considering the hourly traffic distribution throughout the day , the division of the traffic among passenger vehicles , single-unit trucks , and combination trucks , the division of traffic between commercial and noncommercial vehicles , the division of traffic between Doe Street and Roe Avenue and the proportion of the various types of turning movements , the following estimates are made : 1 . Average daily extra motor vehicle operating costs due to stops will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for T. 2 . Average daily costs of time delays will be $37.20 for R , $61.90 for S , and $34.30 for T. These estimates consider only time delays for commercial vehicles and disregard time delays for noncommercial vehicles . 3 . Average daily accident costs will be $7.20 for R , $3.80 for S , and $6.60 for T. These figures are based on the average accident records for the past 5 years at approximately 100 similar installations of these three types in this city and neighboring cities . Assuming a 365-day year and a 10-year study period , and using an i ? of 7% , make an economic analysis of the benefits and costs of the three types of  | traffic control . What is the B/C ratio of S as compared to R ? Of T as compared to R ? Of T as compared to S ? If a B/C ratio greater than unity is sufficient to justify a proposed investment , which alternative would you recommend ? 9-8 . In Problem 9-7 , matters treated as irreducible data included the time loss to users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the differences in the contributions to regional air pollution due to the differences in the numbers of stops and starts of motor vehicles , and the adverse consequences of accidents that were not reflected by the monetary evaluation . Discuss these irreducibles in relation to the problem of choice among R , S , and T. 9-9 . For a certain proposed government project , annual capital costs to the government are $200,000 and annual operation and maintenance costs to the government are $100,000 . Annual favorable consequences to the general public of $1,000,004 are offset by certain annual adverse consequences of $400,000 to a portion of the general public . What is the B/C ratio if all consequences to any of the general public are counted in the numerator of the ratio and all consequences to the government are counted in the denominator ? What will it be if the classification of the $400,000 adverse consequences to the general public is changed from a disbenefit to a cost ? If the $100,000 operation and maintenance cost to the government is changed from a cost to a disbenefit ? If both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items , what is the excess of benefits over costs ? 9-10 . For a certain proposed government project , annual capital costs to the government are $300,000 and annual operation and maintenance costs to the government are $700,000 . Annual favorable consequences to the general public of $1,000,000 are partially offset by certain annual adverse consequences of $200,000 to a portion of the general public . What is the B/C ratio if all consequences to any of the general public are counted in the numerator of the ratio and all consequences to the government are counted in the denominator ? What will it be if the classification of the $200,000 adverse consequences to the general public is changed from a disbenefit to a cost ? If the $700,000 operation and maintenance cost to the government is changed from a cost to a disbenefit ? If both changes are made ? Regardless of the classification of these two items , the benefits are $200,000 less than the costs . However , this is a project that will be of great advantage to certain persons in the general public who are promoting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the project are so important that the project should be undertaken even though the estimated benefits are somewhat less than the estimated costs .

The " expected value " of the annual cost of flood damages is $310,000 with a continuation of the present condition of no flood control , $145,000 with LD , and $60,000 with IID .

JUSTICE OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES 1 The examples of economy studies in Chapters 6 , 7 , and 8 started with estimates of the effect on cash flow of proposed decisions between alternatives . No mention was made of the effect on the accounts of an enterprise . The topic of the relationship between accounting and economy studies is introduced in the present chapter . This chapter deals primarily with one facet of accounting , namely , accounting for depreciable fixed assets ( such as buildings , structures , machinery , and equipment ) . Why Should Students of Engineering Economy Learn About De predation Accounting ? Persons responsible for decisions on the acquisition and retirement of fixed assets need a general understanding of depreciation accounting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are developed in the present chapter : 1 . Often it is necessary to reconcile economy studies with the accounts of an enterprise . This need arises in various ways . Some data for economy studies come from the accounts and must be modified by conversion to cash flow before they are suitable for use in the economy studies . Frequently it is necessary that economy studies be related to the accounts for presentation to colleagues , to management personnel , or to the general public . The follow-up ( if any ) of decisions based on economy studies must be based in part on figures from the accounts . footnotes 1 In a 1918 United States Supreme Court decision , Towne v. Eisner , 245 U.S. 41 H , 1 AI  | 2 . Economy studies for private enterprise require estimates of the amounts and dates of the outlays for income taxes that will be affected by a choice among proposed alternatives . In most cases , such estimates involve consideration of the depreciation methods that will be used for tax purposes . Although depreciation deductions from taxable income in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from accounting income , it is necessary to understand depreciation accounting if one is to understand the income tax treatment of depreciation . In fact , the authors believe that this relationship between depreciation accounting and income taxes makes it essential that persons responsible for economy studies have some understanding of depreciation accounting . 3 . Several approximate methods used by some analysts for computing the annual cost of capital recovery are related to two methods of depreciation accounting , namely , the straight-line method and the sinking-fund method . 4 . There are in common use several methods of making so-called rate of return studies that depend on the depreciation accounts . The student of engineering economy needs to understand these methods in order to be aware of their deficiencies . This book deals with depreciation accounting primarily in relation to engineering economy ; there are many aspects of the subject that are not presented at all or that are discussed only briefly and superficially . Some other aspects of depreciation accounting referred to later in the book are as follows : 1 . Chapters 15 and 17 point out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replacements ? errors that are related in part to a misunderstanding of depreciation accounting . 2 . Chapter 18 shows the relationship between depreciation accounting and one source of funds for investment in fixed assets . It also discusses the relationship between depreciation accounting and the provision of funds for the replacement of assets . 3 . Chapter 21 discusses a common misuse of depreciation accounting in computing so-called payoff periods . A Classification of Reasons for Retirement . Property units are generally retired for one or more of the following reasons : 1 . The availability of improved machines or structures for performing the same service . Research and development work by scientists and engineers is continually leading to new and more economical ways of doing existing jobs . If the prospective economies from new methods are sufficient , it will pay to replace old assets with new ones or to relegate the old assets to stand-by purposes or other inferior uses .  | 2 . Changes in the amount and type of service requirements . This includes such changes as increase or decrease in the amount of service required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decrease in the demand for its product or service . It also includes changes in the product or service required . These changes frequently arise from competitive situations , either from competition among producers in a single industry or from competition with substitute products or services . They may also be caused by acts of public authority . 3 . Changes in the existing machines or structures themselves . Machines and structures wear out , corrode , and decay as the result of age and use . Often this increases maintenance costs and decreases the quality and reliability of performance to the extent that it pays to replace assets that are still capable of continuing to render service . In some circumstances wearing out , corrosion , and decay may make retirement imperative rather than merely economical . 4 . Changes in public requirements regarding the machine or structure . 5 . Casualties . These reasons for retirement are not mutually exclusive , but in most cases operate in combination with one another . Thus an old machine might be replaced by a new one that ( 1 ) incorporated new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) provided increased capacity to meet an increased demand for the product , and ( 3 ) had the prospect of initial maintenance costs considerably lower than the current high maintenance costs of the old machine . Obsolescence ( 1 ) , inadequacy ( 2 ) , wearing out ( 3 ) , etc. , also are responsible for reductions in value of old assets long before the assets reach the point where immediate retirement is economical . Mortality Dispersion for Physical Property Units . Not all human beings die at the same age . Some die young and others live to a ripe old age . Nevertheless , it is possible to analyze human mortality experience to determine curves and tables that give satisfactory estimates of average life and of the percentage of survivors at any age . Thus a life insurance company can predict with confidence what percentage of 100,000 healthy white native males 20 years old will survive to the ages of 27 or 49 or 65 , even though it is not possible to say with respect to any individual whether he will survive any given number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in having a mortality dispersion . Of a number of property units that seem identical , some will be retired at an early age and others will serve many years before retirement . This fact of mortality dispersion is illustrated in Figure 10-1.  | This figure shows two curves that have been derived in the analysis of the retirement experience of telephone exchange underground cable . The reversed curve starting in the upper left-hand corner of the diagram is called a survivor curve . It shows the percentage of this type of plant that , in the particular group of cable studied , may be expected to be in service at any given number of years after its installation . For instance , 70% will be in service after 15 years of life . The lower stepped curve is a retirement frequency curve . It shows the annual retirements expressed as a percentage of the original amount installed . Although the maximum number of retirements is at age 20 , retirements are taking place from the 1st year of life to the 44th year . These curves are mathematically fitted ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several million dollars ' worth of  | exchange underground cable . Curves of this type have been developed in connection with the requirements of depreciation accounting . Such curves may be developed from statistical analysis that uses data involving exposures to the risk of retirement and actual retirements of units of various ages . The curves therefore reflect retirements for all causes ; they give weight to the results of technological progress and environmental changes as well as to the tendency of industrial assets to deteriorate as they get older . As might be expected , a series of such statistical analyses made over a period of years often indicates that average service lives are shortening for some classes of assets and lengthening for other classes . Statistical analysis of the type used in obtaining curves such as Figure 10 ? 1 can only reflect the ages at which retirements actually have been made . For various reasons mentioned in Chapter 17 , it often happens that assets are kept in service beyond the date at which it would have paid to retire them . It follows that economic service lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be determined from a statistical analysis of retirements . ' The statistical approach to industrial property mortality obviously requires that there have been a fair number of retirements of the type of assets being studied . For this reason , difficulties arise in applying the statistical approach to new types of assets or to very long-lived types of assets . The Various Meanings of " Depreciation . " The meanings of words develop out of their use . Many words are used in a number of different meanings . Depreciation is such a word . In any use of the word , there needs to be a clear differentiation among these various meanings . In his outstanding book , Valuation of Property , Professor J. C. Bonbright 3 points out that substantially all the different technical meanings attached to the word depreciation are variants of four basic concepts . These are : 1 . DECREASE IN VALUE . This concept implies that the value of one asset is in some way computed at two different dates . The value at the later date subtracted from the value at the earlier date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been responsible for the value change . When depreciation is used in everyday speech , this footnote 2 For a concise explanation of the various statistical methods of finding average service life , see E. L. Grant and P. T. Norton , Jr. , Depreciation ( New York : The Ronald Press Co. , 1955 ) , chap . v. See also Robley Winfrey , Statistical Analysis of Industrial Property Retirements , ( Ames , Iowa : Bulletin 125 , Iowa Engineering Experiment Station , 1935 ) . 3 J. C. Bonbright , Valuation of Property ( New York : McGraw-Ilill Book Co. , Inc. , 1937 ) , chap . x.  | is the meaning generally implied ; it is also implied by most dictionary definitions . Like depreciation , value is a word with many meanings . As pointed out by Professor Bonbright , the two most important and useful of these meanings in the economic sense of the word are market value and value to the owner . Depreciation in the sense of decrease in value may apply to either of these two concepts of value . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appraisal , or in any other appropriate way . 2 . AMORTIZED COST . This is the accounting concept of depreciation , which is being discussed in the present chapter . From the viewpoint of accounting , the cost of an asset is a prepaid operating expense to be apportioned among the years of its life by some more or less systematic procedure . It should be emphasized that it is cost , not value , that is apportioned in orthodox accounting . The accounting concept of depreciation is well described in a report of the Committe on Terminology of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants as follows : 4 Depreciation accounting is a system of accounting which aims to distribute the cost or other basic value of tangible capital assets , less salvage ( if any ) , over the estimated useful life of the unit ( which may be a group of assets ) in a systematic and rational manner . It is a process of allocation , not of valuation . Depreciation for the year is the portion of the total charge under such a system that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly take into account occurrences during the year , it is not intended to be a measurement of the effect of all such occurrences . Although we shall use the common phrase book value to describe the difference between the cost of an asset and the total of the depreciation charges made to date against the asset , this difference is more accurately described as unamortized cost . 3 . DIFFERENCE IN VALUE BETWEEN AN EXISTING OLD ASSET AND A HYPOTHETICAL NEW ASSET TAKEN AS A STANDARD OF COMPARISON . This is the appraisal concept of depreciation . Many appraisals of old assets are based on replacement cost . A replacement cost appraisal should answer the question " What could one afford to pay for this asset in comparison with the most economical new one ? " An upper limit on the value to its owner of an old asset may be determined by considering the cost of reproducing its service with the most economical new asset available for performing the same service . This most economical new substitute asset may have many advantages over an existing old asset , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Accounting Terminology Bulletin No. 1 : Review and Resume ( para . 56 ) , American Institute of Certified Public Accountants , 1953.  | bursements for operation and maintenance , increased receipts from sale of product or service . The deduction from the cost of the hypothetical new substitute asset should be a measure in money terms of all of these disadvantages of the existing old asset . In the language of appraisal , this deduction is called depreciation . Appraisal depreciation , therefore , should mean the value inferiority at some particular date ( the date of the appraisal ) of one asset , the existing old one being appraised , to another asset , a hypothetical new one used as the basis of valuation . This concept implies two assets and the measurement of their values at one date . 4 . IMPAIRED SERVICEABLENESS . As machines become older they are often unable to hold as close tolerances as when they were new . Similarly , the strength of structures may be impaired by the decay of timber members or the corrosion of metal members . Engineers have sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency . It should be emphasized that this is not a value concept at all . Impaired serviceableness may result in decrease in value , but there are many other common reasons for decrease in value . Assets that are physically as good as new are not necessarily as valuable as when they were new . They may have higher operation and maintenance costs ; they will nearly always have shorter life expectancy ; service conditions may have changed ; more economical alternative methods may have become available . As the use of depreciation in the sense of impaired serviceableness has generally led to confusion in valuation matters , the word is not used in this sense elsewhere in this book . Concepts of Value.5 As previously stated , the most useful economic concepts of value are market value and value to the owner . Market value properly refers to the price at which a property could actually be sold . For certain types of valuation this is not an appropriate concept to use . Often only one owner is in a position to make effective use of a given item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be of great monetary importance to its owner , the property might bring only a negligible price if sold to someone else . Hence the concept of value to a specific owner is of great importance in the valuation of property . Value to the owner may be defined as the money amount that would be just sufficient to compensate the owner if he were to be deprived of the property . Generally speaking , this value will not be greater than the money amount for which the owner could soon replace the property with the best available substitute , with due allowance for the superiority or inferiority of that substitute . And , gen5 For an authoritative and thorough discussion of value concepts , see Bonbright , op. cit. , chaps . 3 , 4 , and 5.  | erally speaking , value to the owner will not be less than the market price for which the property could be sold . The concept of value to the owner may properly be applied to a prospective owner as well as to a present owner . The word value is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as any money amount that is associated with specific items of property for some given purpose . An example of this is the use of the phrase book value to describe the unamortized cost of property as shown by the books of account . The Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss Statement . Any presentation of the elements of accounting must focus attention on two important types of statements obtained from the accounts . One of these , the balance sheet , describes the condition of an enterprise at a particular moment , for example , at the close of business on the final day of a fiscal year . The balance sheet shows what the enterprise owns ( its assets ) , what it owes ( its liabilities ) , and shows the " value " of the owners ' equity in the enterprise as the excess of assets over liabilities . All balance sheet valuations are arrived at using the formal and systematic rules of accounting and sometimes differ greatly from market value of the same properties . The other statement , the profit and loss statement , also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an enterprise as shown by the books of account for a period of time and states whether the enterprise has made a profit or loss and how much . The longest period of time covered by the usual profit and loss statement is a fiscal year . ( A business fiscal year does not always coincide with the calendar year , as it may start on some date other than January 1 . ) The figures in the profit and loss statement , like those in the balance sheet , are determined using the formal and systematic rules of accounting . Example 10-1 illustrates the relationship between depreciation accounting and the balance sheet and profit and loss statement in an extremely simple case . This example describes an actual investment from which certain complicating factors have been omitted . Example 10-2 deals with another actual case that is relatively simple , illustrating a common method of estimating year-by-year return on investment from the accounts . Both examples deal with terminated business enterprises . It will be noted that in Example 10-1 the enterprise finally turned out to he unsuccessful even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise was extremely profitable . In contrast , Example 10-2 deals with an enterprise that finally turned out to be much more profitable than it first seemed to be from an analysis of the accounts .  | EXAMPLE 10-1 . DEPRECIATION IN THE ACCOUNTS OF A MINIATURE GOLF COURSE Facts of the Case . During the early days of so-called miniature golf courses during the depression years in the United States , an individual whom we shall call George Spelvin built the first such course in his home city . He rented a vacant lot in a strategic central location and spent $4,500 to construct his golf course . When he shut down for the winter at the end of his first year , he had taken in $5,000 in admission fees and had paid out $1,500 for various operating expenses . At this time he refused an offer of $8,500 from an amusement syndicate for his golf course and lease . When he commenced operations again in the spring of his second year , the local interest in miniature golf had declined to the point where his receipts barely covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months on this unsatisfactory basis and then abandoned his venture . Financial Statements for the First Year and Their Relationship to Depreciation Accounting . At the time of completion of the construction of the golf course , the balance sheet for this enterprise ( if one had been prepared ) would have been as follows : figure At the close of his first season , if Spelvin had not recognized that part of the service life of his golf course had expired , he would have believed that his profit was $3,500 , the excess of his receipts over his disbursements . Under this unrealistic assumption , his balance sheet before his withdrawal of any of this " profit " would have been : figure Actually he estimated a 5-year life for his golf course and decided to allocate $900 , one-fifth of his $4,500 outlay , as the depreciation expense of the first year 's operations . ( We shall see that this is the straight-line method of depreciation accounting . ) The book value of his golf course was reduced by $900 as a result of his accounting entry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his accounts was $900 less than it would have been if no depreciation had been recognized . His year-end balance sheet after giving recognition to this depreciation write-off was : figure  | His profit and loss statement for the year was : figure This profit shown by the books was 58% of Spelvin 's original $4,500 investment . Comment on the Foregoing Financial Statements . This simple example illustrates several important points regarding depreciation accounting , as follows : 1 . The operation of making the $900 depreciation charge on the books of account involved no cash flow . In effect , the $900 depreciation entry was an allocation to the first year of operation of a portion of a previous $4,500 cash flow that the accounts had viewed as causing the acquisition of an asset rather than as the incurring of an expense . ( Later in this chapter , we shall see that even though the act of making a depreciation entry on the books does not in itself change the cash on hand , a depreciation entry in an income tax return influences the cash flow for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the depreciation figure in his tax return had been based on his books of account , his tax payments would have been influenced by the depreciation charge entered in his books. ) 2 . The profit as shown by the books of account depends on the depreciation charge and therefore is influenced by the estimated life and salvage value and by the depreciation accounting method selected . Thus Spelvin 's use of straight-line depreciation accounting and his assumption of a 5-year life and no salvage value gave him a profit figure of $2,600 . If he had assumed a 2-year life and charged half of the $4,500 cost of the golf course as depreciation , his profit figure would have been only $1,250 . If he had assumed that the golf course would always have 100% salvage value , his profit figure would have been $3,500 . Although , as the quoted definition said , depreciation accounting requires the writing off of cost " in a systematic and rational manner , " there are many different systematic and rational ways to write off cost , and these different ways give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets on the balance sheet is similarly influenced by the depreciation charge . The so-called book value of an asset is nicrely that portion of the cost of the asset that has not yet been charged off as depreciation expense . The book value of the golf course was  | $3,600 at the end of the first year because $900 of depreciation had been charged against the year 's operations and deducted from the $4,500 cost of the course . If the depreciation charge had been less than $900 , the book value would have been higher ; if the depreciation charge had been more than $900 , the book value would have been lower . The quoted definition of depreciation accounting pointed out that " it is a process of allocation and not of valuation . " The valuation shown for a depreciable asset on the books of account is not influenced by unpredicted fluctuations in market value . Thus the $3,600 book value for the golf course was not influenced by the fact that the syndicate 's offer , turned down by Spelvin , indicated that the course had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the balance sheet was prepared . EXAMPLE 10 ? 2 . YEAR-BY-YEAR ESTIMATES OF RATES OF RETURN FROM AN INVESTMENT IN RENTAL PROPERTY Facts of the Case . Example 8 ? 1 ( page 110 ) described an investment in rental property . The cash flow series from this investment was shown in Table 8 ? 1 . The rate of return on the investment was 18.9% before income taxes , as computed in Table 8 ? 2 by appropriate compound interest methods . Because a property costing $10,900 was sold for a net $20,900 after 7 years of ownership , the actual rate of return from the terminated investment was considerably higher than the rate of return had appeared to be during the period of ownership . Table 10 ? 1 shows the figures for annual profits as shown by the accounts of this enterprise for its first 6 years of operation . For purposes of accounting , the $10,900 investment was broken down as follows :  | In accordance with the conventions of accounting , no prospective decrease ( or increase ) in the value of land was considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buildings were assumed to have a 40-year life with no salvage value , and the furniture was assumed to have a 10-year life with no salvage value . Straight-line depreciation was charged in the accounts at $200 a year for the buildings and at $140 a year for furniture , a total of $340 a year . The profit figures for each year shown in the next-to-last column of Table 10 ? 1 are the years ' positive cash flows diminished by the $340 depreciation charge . The table also shows the book value of the property at the start of each year . In the first year this was the investment of $10,900 ; each year it was diminished by the $340 depreciation charge made in the books of account . The final column of the table shows the profit for each year expressed as a percentage of the start-of-year book value . This latter figure may be thought of as a current estimate of rate of return on investment computed by a method that often is used in relation to the accounts of an enterprises Tentative Character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An incidental aspect of Examples 10 ? 1 and 10 ? 2 is that both examples illustrate the point that intermediate judgments about profitability and about rates of return may be considerably in error . In fact , the two actual cases used in these examples are extreme cases deliberately selected to emphasize this point . In Example 10 ? 1 the rate of return appeared to be 58% at the end of the first year even though when the investment was terminated it turned out that there was not even a 0% return . In Example 10 ? 2 , the rates of return for the first three years appeared to be less than 9% even though the over-all rate of return on the terminated investment turned out to be approximately 19% . Of course the true over-all rate of return obtained over the life of an investment can not be known until ownership has been terminated . Nevertheless , year-by-year figures for profit are essential in the conduct of a business ( and in the collection of income taxes ) ; it is not practicable to wait until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profitability . It is natural to compute year-by-year rates of return by relating the profit figures taken from the accounts to some investment figure also taken from the accounts . At this point in our discussion a clear distinction needs to be made between the problem of computing a single figure for rate of return on an investment based on the full period of consequences of the investment and the problem of estimating year-by-year figures for rate of return . As explained in Chapter 8 ( and demonstrated in Table 8-6 ) , compound interest methods are required to find the correct figure for rate of return footnote 0 An alternate method , also frequently used , is to express the year 's profit as a percentage of the average of the hook values at the start and the finish of the year . For example , the 5th year 's profit , $1,100 , would he divided by $9,370 ( the average of $9,540 and $9,200 ) to obtain an apparent return of 11.7%.  | over the life of an investment . The foregoing statement applies both to the calculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the calculation of estimated rate of return from estimates of cash flow for the entire period of service of a proposed investment . It is rarely , if ever , of much importance to find the rate of return on a terminated past investment ( such as the one in Example 10 ? 2 ) . Although the rate of return may be of historical interest , nothing can be done about terminated investments . In contrast , the estimation of rate of return on a proposed investment is a matter of great practical importance . An important criterion of attractiveness of a proposed investment is the single figure that expresses the prospective rate of return over the life of the investment . It needs to be emphasized that it is this over-all rate of return that is significant for proposed investments , not year-by-year estimates of rates of return of the type illustrated in Table 10 ? 1 . In the opinion of the authors of this book , there is seldom any valid reason for not using correct compound interest methods in analyzing proposed investments . A great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of estimates for economy studies relative to proposed investments . Only a few minutes more time are needed to apply methods of computing rate of return that are correct in principle than are needed to apply any of the various competing incorrect methods . However , several incorrect methods of computing prospective rates of return on proposed investments are in common use in industry . Although these methods all have their origins in the type of calculations of rate of return on past investment illustrated in Examples 10 ? 1 and 10 ? 2 , we shall see that the methods give results that differ greatly from one another . Sometimes these methods are used in the belief that they are good approximations to correct compound interest methods ; sometimes they are used under the illusion that they are correct in principle . Some of the weaknesses of these methods are illustrated and discussed at the end of this chapter . Before we can describe and evaluate these " approximate " methods , we must first examine the most common methods of depreciation accounting . General Comment on All Methods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of depreciation accounting , it is the cost of tangible assets , less prospective salvage value , that is written off on the books of account . In effect , the cost of capital assets is viewed as a prepaid expense to be apportioned among the years of service of the assets " in a systematic and rational manner . " There are many different methods of writing off cost that obviously  | are " systematic . " " Moreover , methods that differ greatly from one another have been advocated as being " rational . " In the United States the methods in common use have been influenced by changes in income tax laws and regulations , particularly by changes in 1934 , 1954 , and 1962 that will be mentioned in the following discussion . One way to classify depreciation accounting methods is as follows : 1 . Methods that aim to give a greater write-off in the early years of life than in the final years of life 2 . Methods that aim to give a uniform write-off throughout the entire service life 3 . Methods that aim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life than in the final years In class ( 1 ) we shall discuss the declining-balance method , the sumof-the-years-digits method , and certain multiple-straight-line methods . In class ( 2 ) we shall discuss the straight-line method . In class ( 3 ) we shall discuss the sinking-fund method . Because of its historical importance , the straight-line method is discussed first . Straight-Line Depreciation Accounting . In the straight-line method , the full service life of the asset is estimated . The prospective net salvage value at the end of the life is also estimated and expressed as a percentage of first cost . The annual depreciation rate to be applied to the first cost of the asset being written off is computed as follows : figure The same $1,575 may be computed without the use of the 4.5% figure , as follows : figure  | Prior to 1934 , it was common in the manufacturing industries of the United States for cost to be written off in a much shorter period than full service life . For example , the cost of machinery often was written off by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its life . At the expiration of this period the machinery was carried on the books of account as " fully depreciated . " It was not uncommon for the full service lives of machines so written off to be 20 or 25 years or even longer . Although in pre-1934 days , this method of write-off was described as " straight-line , " we shall see that the method is more accurately described as a special case of multiple-straight-line depreciation accounting . A change in policy of the U. S. Treasury Department in 1934 and thereafter was intended to force the writing off of cost for tax purposes over the full service life . With the straight-line method applied over full service life , the final years of life receive exactly the same depreciation charges as the initial years of life . Declining-Balance Depreciation Accounting . It is common for assets " to be used for stand-by or other inferior uses during the final years of their lives . The contribution of assets to income often is much greater in the early years of life than in the final years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Chapter 16 , it usually is sensible to write off the cost of assets more rapidly in the early years of life than in the later years . Several ways of making this more rapid write-off in the early years were authorized for income tax purposes in the United States in 1954 . The use of these liberalized methods for tax purposes was restricted to assets having lives of three years or more that were acquired new by the taxpayers in 1954 or thereafter . One of these methods was the so-called double-rate declining-balance method . In any declining-balance depreciation accounting , a given depreciation rate is applied each year to the remaining book value , that is , to that portion of the cost of an asset ( or assets ) that has not already been written off in a previous year . For example , if a 10% rate is applied to an asset that cost $35,000 , the depreciation charge in the first year is 0.10 ( $35,000 ) = $3,500 . In the second year the charge is 0.10 ( $35,000 ? $3,500 ) = 0.10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is 0.10 ( $31,500 ? $3,150 ) = 0.10 ( $28,350 ) = $2,835 . And so on . In the double-rate declining-balance method authorized for income tax purposes in the United States in 1954 , the depreciation rate is computed as 200% - ( estimated life in years ) . This rate is double the straight-line rate that would be allowed for an asset that has an estimated zero salvage value and the given estimated life . In computing the permissible declin-  | ing-balance rate , any prospective terminal salvage value is disregarded . Consider , for example , the $35,000 machine tool for which we computed the 4.5% straight-line rate . This had a 20-year estimated life and a $3,500 estimated salvage value . The permissible declining-balance rate for this asset is 200% ? 20 = 10% . The application of a 10% rate for 20 years will lead to a book value of $4,255 at the end of the 20th year . If P represents the first cost of an asset and f represents the decliningbalance rate expressed as a decimal , the book value at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? f Y. At this point in our discussion , the so-called textbook method of computing a declining-balance rate requires a brief mention . Assume that a rate f is desired that will make the book value at the end of an n-year life exactly equal to an estimated terminal salvage value , L. Then figure However , this method of setting a declining-balance rate is rarely if ever used . It can not be used with zero salvage value . Small differences in estimated salvage value make a great difference in the computed rate . For example , consider two $1,000 assets each with a 20-year estimated life , both with small prospective salvage values . Asset X has an estimated salvage value of $50 ; asset Y has an estimated salvage value of $1 . The declining-balance percentage computed for X is 13.91% and for Y is 29.20% . In the actual use of the declining-balance method , it is better to select a depreciation rate that seems appropriate , all things considered , than to compute a rate from the textbook formula . The declining-balance rates permitted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are intended to permit a write-off of about two-thirds of the cost of an asset in the first half of the estimated life . Sum-of-the-Years-Digits Depreciation Accounting . This method , authorized in the United States by the 1954 tax law , apparently was never used in actual accounting practice before that date . The digits corresponding to the number of years of estimated life are added together . For example , consider our $35,000 machine tool with its estimated life of 20 years . The sum of the digits from 1 to 20 is 210 . The depreciation charge for the first year is 20/210 of the depreciable cost ( i.e. , of the first cost minus the estimated salvage value ) . This is 20/210 ( $35,000 ? $3,500 ) = 20/210 ( $31,500 ) = $3,000 . In the second year the charge is 19/210 ( $31,500 ) = $2,850 . In the third year it is 18/210 ( $31,500 ) =  | $2,700 . And so on . The charge decreases by $150 ( i.e. , by 1/210 of $31,500 ) each year until it is $150 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-fourths of the depreciable cost in the first half of the estimated life . Sinking-Fund Depreciation Accounting . This method visualizes an imaginary sinking fund established by uniform end-of-year annual deposits throughout the life of an asset . These deposits are assumed to draw interest at some stated rate , such as 6% , 4% , or 3% , and are just sufficient so that the fund will equal the cost of the asset minus its estimated salvage value at the end of its estimated life . The amount charged as depreciation expense in any year consists of the sinking-fund deposit plus the interest on the imaginary accumulated fund . The book value at any time is the first cost of the asset minus the amount accumulated in the imaginary fund up to date . The sinking-fund method is also known as the present-worth method ; the book value at any time is equal to the present worth of the uniform annual cost of capital recovery for the remaining years of life plus the present worth of the prospective salvage value . For example , assume that our $35,000 machine tool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The annual sinking-fund deposit is ( $35,000 ? $3,500 ) ( A/F , 6%,20 ) = ( $31,500 ) ( 0.02718 ) = $856.2 . This will also be the depreciation charge in the first year . In the second year the depreciation charge will be $856.2 + $856.2(0.06) = $907.6 . In the third year it will be $856.2 + ( $856.2 + $907.6 ) ( 0.06 ) = $962.0 . And so on . The book value at any age can be computed without year-by-year calculations by finding the amount in the imaginary sinking fund and subtracting this amount from the first cost . For instance , the sinking fund at the end of 12 years will amount to $856.2(F/A,6%,12) = $856.2-(16.870) = $14,444 . The book value at this time is therefore $35,000 ? $14,444 = $20,556 . This book value may be checked by computing the present worth at date 12 of the annual cost of capital recovery for the remaining 8 years plus the present worth of the terminal salvage value . The annual capital recovery-cost is ( $35,000 ? $3,500 ) ( A/P , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ( 0.08718 ) + $3,500 ( 0.06 ) $2,746.2 + $210.0 = $2,956.2 . The sum of the present worths of remaining capital recovery and terminal salvage value is $2,956.2(P/A,6%,8) + $3,500-(P/F,6%,8) = $2,956.2(6.210) + $3,500(0.6274) = $18,358 + $2,196 = $20,554 . ( The interest tables in this book are riot carried to enough significant figures for this calculation to check to the nearest dollar . ) Book values with the sinking-fund method are always greater than they would be with the straight-line method . The difference is greater  | for long-lived assets than for short-lived ones , and is greater with high interest rates than with low ones . The straight-line method has sometimes been described as the limiting case of the sinking-fund method in which the interest rate has been assumed to be 0% . Although the sinking-fund method was used in certain industries a few decades ago , it has ceased to be of much importance in actual accounting practice . It is explained here primarily because of the use of so-called sinking-fund depreciation in certain engineering economy studies in a manner explained later in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Various Methods . Table 10 ? 2 shows the year-by-year write-offs that would be made for our $35,000 machine tool by the four methods that have been explained . The table also shows end-of-year book values . In the de-  | clining-balance and the 6% sinking-fund methods , the book values have been rounded off to the nearest dollar for listing in the table ; the figures shown in the table for yearly depreciation charges have been made consistent with the figures shown for book value . It is evident that " systematic " ways of writing off cost can differ greatly from one another . Comment on the rational basis of a choice among the different methods is deferred until later in the chapter . Some Other Methods of Depreciation Accounting . Some types of capital assets can be identified with the production of specific units of output . For such assets , depreciation can be charged in proportion to units of production provided it is reasonable to estimate life in production units . The method has been used for assets associated with exhaustible natural resources where the factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natural resource in question . Thus the cost of a sawmill might be depreciated at so much per thousand board feet sawed , or the cost of a coal mine tipple might be depreciated at so much per ton of coal mined . Frequently the unit-of-production method is used for motor vehicles with depreciation charged in proportion to miles of operation . The method is rarely used in diversified manufacturing because of the difficulty of finding any suitable production unit . It is possible to use depreciation accounting methods where two or more straight lines are needed to show the decline in book value from first cost to estimated salvage value . Such a scheme may be described as a multiple-straight-line method . Under the United States 1954 tax law , multiple-straight-line methods may be used for tax purposes subject to the restriction that the amount written off at any time during the first two-thirds of life is not more than would have been permitted under the declining-balance method . For example , our $35,000 machine tool might be written off at $2,250 a year for the first 10 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A special case of the multiple-straight-line method is the one in which the entire first cost ( less estimated salvage value , if any ) is written off on a straight-line basis in some period shorter than the life . As previously stated , this was the common situation in the United States before 1934 . When an asset with a 25-year life was written off at 10% a year for 10 years and 0% for the remaining 15 years , this was really a multiplestraight-line method with one of the straight-line rates as 0% . Under the 1954 tax law in the United States , it is permissible to switch from the declining-balance method to the straight-line method at any time before an asset is retired . For example , Table 10 ? 2 shows the book value of our machine tool by the declining-balance method to be $8,897 at the end of 13 years . If the estimated remaining life on this date is still  | 7 years and the estimated salvage value is still $3,500 , a straight-line write-off of $8897 ? $3,500 = $771 a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Estimates of Service Life and Salvage Value for Tax Returns , for Business Accounting , and for Economy Studies . Certain types of assets , such as automobiles , may have several owners before reaching the scrap heap . For each owner , the " life " for accounting purposes ordinarily is the expected period of service to the owner himself . In general , service life for accounting purposes is viewed as the number of years elapsing from an asset 's acquisition to its final disposal , regardless of the different uses to which the asset may have been put during these years . Since 1934 , the foregoing view of service life has governed the administration of income tax laws in the United States . Estimates of terminal salvage value used for accounting and tax purposes should be consistent with estimated lives . For example , if automobiles are regularly purchased new and disposed of at the end of 3 years , the salvage percentage used in connection with the estimated 3-year life should be an estimated salvage percentage for 3-year-old automobiles . Where sufficient data are available , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average service lives . In many cases such studies lead to survivor curves of the type illustrated in Figure 10-1 . Statistical studies made year after year for a particular class of assets often indicate that the average realized life has been changing . In 1962 the United States Treasury Department made available " guideline lives " for many broad classes of business assets . ' The use of these lives for income tax purposes in the United States was subject to certain restrictions . Some aspects of the use of the guideline lives for tax purposes are discussed in Chapter 16 . In many cases , taxpayers who elected to use these relatively short lives for tax purposes were using considerably longer estimated lives for the same assets in their business accounting . An economy study relative to acquiring a proposed asset involves a somewhat different viewpoint from the keeping of the depreciation accounts for the asset once it is acquired . It may be reasonable to assume a shorter life in the economy study than the one that will be used for accounting or tax purposes . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the estimated full service life , which 7 Internal Revenue Service Publication No. 456 , Depreciation ? Guidelines and Rules , Government Printing Office , Washington , D.C. , 1962 . This publication contains Revenue Procedure 62 ? 21 , the formal authorization for the use of the guideline lives .  | often is the life deemed relevant for accounting and tax purposes , may be considerably longer than the economic life . Moreover , an economy study usually relates to the primary or initial type of service of an asset ; it is rarely appropriate in an economy study to consider possible stand-by or other inferior services very much during the final years of an asset 's life . In some cases an economy study may relate to a shorter period than the expected economic lives of the various proposed assets ; if so , it is necessary to estimate residual values at the end of the study period rather than terminal salvage values at the end of the economic lives . The use of such residual values in economy studies was illustrated in Example 9 ? 1 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Multiple-Asset Depreciation Accounting.8 Assume a group of assets that have the mortality distribution shown in Figure 10-1 . Although the average service life of these assets is 20 years , retirements occur all the way from the first to the 45th year . For the sake of simplicity in the following illustration , assume that the expected salvage value is zero and that each asset , when retired , actually has a zero salvage value . Assume that straight-line depreciation is to be used ; the 20-year average service life and zero salvage value requires a 5% depreciation rate . Now assume that each asset has its own account and that the depreciation on each asset is computed separately . ( This is referred to as single-asset or item depreciation accounting . ) Approximately half of the assets will be retired before they are 20 years old . Every such asset will have some book value when retired ; with no realized salvage value , the books of account will show a " loss " for each retirement . The half of the assets that survive for more than 20 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further depreciation charges will be made against them during their period of service from years 20 to 45 . In contrast , assume that one account is used to include the investment in all of these assets ; each year the depreciation charge is made against the group of assets rather than against the individual asset and the book value at any time applies to the group with no identifiable separate figure applicable to each asset . With the assets considered in a group and with the fact of mortality dispersion recognized , it will he evident that the retirements at ages short of 20 years are not " premature " in the sense that they are inconsistent with the estimate of a 20-year average service life . If a set of unequal numbers are averaged , some of the numbers must be less than the average and others must be greater . The recognition of this point in multiple-asset depreciation accounting 8 For a more complete discussion of this topic , see Grant and Norton , op. cit. , particularly chaps . 6 , 7 , 8 , 10 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entry under normal circumstances . However , in multiple-asset accounting , depreciation charges continue beyond the average service life . In the language used in publications of the U. S. Internal Revenue Service , a distinction is made among three general types of multipleasset accounts , as follows : 1 . Group accounts . Examples of such accounts would be passenger automobiles , punch presses , office desks. 2 . Classified acounts . Some examples are transportation equipment , machinery , furniture and fixtures . 3 . Composite accounts . As an example , transportation equipment , machinery , and furniture and fixtures might be included in a single account . Particularly in the manufacturing industries , the most common practice is to use classified accounts for income tax purposes . Often , the use of item accounts is limited to such assets as buildings and structures . In this book the most important use of depreciation accounting is in connection with the calculation of cash flow for income taxes . In most of our examples and problems illustrating such calculations , our computations of the tax aspects of depreciation are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This assumption of single-asset accounting is made chiefly for reasons of simplicity ? to avoid the heed to devote space to an explanation of the numerous technical details of multiple-asset accounting . In many studies , particularly those relative to proposed new assets , it makes no difference whether single-asset or multiple-asset accounting is assumed . An economy study for a proposed retirement is one type of study in which the timing of cash flow for income taxes with single-asset accounting may differ greatly from the timing with multiple-asset accounting . Often the critical point in this type of study is whether a " loss on disposal " will be allowable for tax purposes . This topic is discussed in Chapter 17 . Certain Types of Assets Not Subject to Depreciation Charges in the Accounts . It is a convention of accounting that land is carried on the books at its original cost regardless of changes in its market value . No depreciation or appreciation on land is shown in the books of account . Of course , if land is finally sold at a price above or below its original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigned to the year of the sale is shown on the books . But for accounting purposes , it is not necessary to make an rrsti-nate of the future sale price of land . In the absence of any basis for a different forecast , some economy studies may follow the lead of orthodox accounting and assume ? in effect  | ? that investments in land will have 100% salvage values . But cases occur where this is not an appropriate assumption . Sometimes there is good reason to forecast that at the end of a study period land will be sold for much more or much less than its original cost .. If so , this forecast is relevant in any analysis to guide the decision on whether or not to invest in the land ; the estimated future sale price of the land is one element of cash flow to include in the economy study . Many economy studies relate to the investment in plant to permit the sale of a new product or expanded sale of an existing product . In addition to the investment in physical plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds . The working fund investment will usually include inventories of materials , work in process , and finished goods . It will also include the excess of accounts receivable associated with the project over accounts payable similarly associated . For certain types of product there may also be an inventory of returnable containers to be considered . The working fund investment is not subject to depreciation on the books of account . For purposes of an economy study an outlay for working funds should ordinarily be treated as if it were an investment that had a prospective 100% salvage value at the end of the study period . That is , it usually is reasonable to expect that when a product is discontinued the accounts receivable will be collected and the inventories will be liquidated . This treatment was illustrated in Example 8-3 . Comments on certain aspects of the estimation of working fund requirements are made in Chapter 15 . Economy-Study Estimates of Cash Flow for Income Taxes Based on Certain Simplified Assumptions . Many of the examples and problems in Chapters 6 , 7 , and 8 included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would be caused by a choice among stated alternatives . In those studies applicable to competitive industry , these estimates were made under the following simplified assumptions : 1 . The same estimated lives and salvage values used in the economy study will also be used for tax purposes and will be acceptable to the taxing authorities . 2 . Straight-line item depreciation accounting will be used for tax purposes . 3 . Throughout the period of the economy study , the effective tax rate on an increment of taxable income will be 50%. 4 . Except for capital items , receipts and disbursements before taxes in any year apply to the calculation of the taxable income for that year . ( Capital items include first costs and salvage values of depreciable  | plant . They also include assets such as land and working capital that are not subject to depreciation charges in computing taxable income. ) 5 . Recovery of investments in nondepreciable assets such as land and working capital does not give rise to any tax consequences . Both the absolute total amount and the timing of prospective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investments . A reasonable question about the foregoing simple assumptions is whether they give results that are good enough for practical purposes in investment evaluation . The answer is that sometimes these assumptions are fairly good ones in competitive industry in the United States and sometimes they are not good at all . In Chapter 16 we take a critical look at various matters that influence the amount and timing of the income tax consequences of decisions in competitive industry . In the intervening chapters , the simplified assumptions permit us to make a number of examples and problems more realistic by including differences in estimated cash disbursements for income taxes . The treatment of prospective income taxes in economy studies for regulated public utilities in the United States is a specialized topic that is related to the way in which public utility rates are regulated . This topic is not discussed until Chapter 20 . Verification of Income Tax Differences Given in Examples 6 ? 1 and 6-2 . Consider the application of the foregoing assumptions to the data of Examples 6 ? 1 and 6 ? 2 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these two examples : figure These were alternatives with reference to production methods ; the receipts from the sale of the product or service would not be influenced by the choice among the three plans . Therefore , the difference in estimated income taxes depends only on the differences in estimated tax deductions . The deductions from taxable income each year are as follows : figure  | 50% of $2,600 . This $1,300 was the income tax figure given in the statement of Example 6 ? 1 . Because Plan C has $2,900 less deductions from taxable income than Plan A , it will involve higher annual income tax disbursements of $1,450 , 50% of $2,900 . This $1,450 was the income tax figure given in the statement of Example 6 ? 2 . Explanation of the Method of Estimating Each Year 's Income Taxes Given in Example 8 ? 3 . The third paragraph of Example 8 ? 3 ended as follows : The specific estimates of net positive before-tax cash flow from operations year by year are : 1 , $100,000 ; 2 , $300,000 ; 3 , $400,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , $400,000 ; 14 , $300,000 ; and 15 , $200,000 . These positive cash flows will be diminished by yearly disbursements for income taxes estimated to be 50% of the amount that each year 's figure exceeds $100,000 . The depreciable investment in plant and equipment in this example was $1,500,000 made over a period of two years . The depreciation charge for accounting and tax purposes would not start until date 0 when the construction would be completed and the plant put in service . Because the estimated life was 15 years with no terminal salvage value , the annual straight-line depreciation is $1,500,000 = 15 = $100,000 . It is this $100,000 deduction from taxable income that was referred to in the second sentence quoted from the statement of Example 8 ? 3 . The reader will note that Example 8 ? 3 differs from Examples 6 ? 1 and 6 ? 2 in that the choice between the alternatives ( accepting the project or rejecting it ) involves differences in annual receipts . Moreover , because the estimated before-tax positive cash flow varies from year to year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year to year . According to the conventions of accounting and income taxation , the $300,000 outlay for land and the $200,000 outlay for working capital are nondepreciable and therefore have no influence on estimated disbursements for income taxes during the 15-year operating period of the project . Because it is assumed that these investments will be recovered without increase or decrease at the end of the 15-year operating period , the cash flow incident to their recovery at date 15 has no influence on income taxes in the 15th year , the terminal date of the project . Some Economy-Study Methods That Appear to Tie Annual Capital Recovery Costs to the Depreciation Accounts . One of the topics presented in Chapter 6 was the conversion of a first cost , P , into an equivalent uniform annual figure over a life or study period . To make this conversion , it is necessary to have a stipulated minimum attractive rate of  | return or interest rate , is , an estimated life or study period , n , and an estimated salvage value , L , at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we use the following equation to compute this annual cost of capital recovery with a return : CR = ( P ? L ) ( A/P , i ? , n ) + Li* This equation , which involves the use of the capital recovery factor , obviously is independent of the depreciation accounts . In some economy studies that use the method of annual costs , various combinations of depreciation figures and interest figures are used . The total of depreciation plus interest is intended to serve the same purpose as our annual cost of capital recovery with a return . Three methods that sometimes are used are as follows : 1 . Sinking-fund depreciation plus interest on first cost 2 . Straight-line depreciation plus interest on first cost 3 . Straight-line depreciation plus average interest These methods give satisfactory results in some cases and misleading results in others . Sinking-Fund Depreciation Plus Interest on First Cost . This is a correct compound interest method that gives the same annual cost of capital recovery as our conventional method provided the assumed interest rate on the sinking fund is equal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method is referred to as interest plus amortization . As explained in Chapter 4 , the capital recovery factor is always equal to the sinking fund factor plus the interest rate . An alternate way of writing our basic equation for capital recovery at interest rate i is there-fore : figure In effect , the method of sinking-fund depreciation plus interest on first cost is based on this latter formula . A numerical example will help to show the relationship between this method and the conventional method . Let us assume an asset with a first cost of $22,000 , an estimated life of 10 years , and an estimated salvage value of $2,000 . We shall use a minimum attractive rate of return of 10% . By the conventional method that is used throughout this hook : figure  | Assuming the use of a 10% interest rate in computing sinking-fund depreciation , the calculation by the method of sinking-fund depreciation plus interest on first cost reaches an identical result , as follows : figure It should be noted that the figure for so-called sinking-fund depreciation in the foregoing calculation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be made in the books if the sinking-fund method should be used ; it is merely the annuity portion of the depreciation charge . If we should calculate year-by-year depreciation charges in the manner illustrated in Table 10-2 , we would see that the sinking-fund depreciation charge for our $22,000 asset would vary from $1,255 in the first year to $2,959 in the 10th year ; in our calculation of sinking-fund depreciation plus interest on first cost , only the $1,255 figure was used . This annuity portion of the sinking-fund depreciation charge is sometimes referred to as amortization.9 ( The verb amortize comes from the same root as mortal and literally means " to make dead or destroy . " It is applied to the provision for extinguishment of a debt or other obligation , particularly through periodic payments into a sinking fund . ) If the interest rate used on the amortization fund differs from the interest rate on first cost , the capital recovery cost obtained by this method obviously will differ from the one obtained by a conventional calculation using only one interest rate . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compute interest on first cost and a 3% rate is used in the sinking fund calculation . The capital recovery cost for our $22,000 asset will then appear to be : figure Some Pros and Cons on the Method of Sinking-Fund Depreciation Plus Interest on First Cost . Although this method has not been common in economy studies in competitive industry , it has been widely used in economy studies for regulated public utilities and for governments . In such studies it is usual to assume the same interest rate on first cost and on the sinking fund . Where used in this manner with a single interest rate , the method gives exactly the same annual cost figure as the method employing the 9 For some reason this word is often mispronounced . The correct division into syllables is a-mor-ti-za-tion , with the second and fourth syllables accented . Tho common mispronunciation assumes the first syllable is am and accents the am.  | capital recovery factor , which is used throughout this book . The choice between these two methods of computing annual cost must therefore be based on other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two methods . If sinking-fund depreciation accounting were actually to be used in the accounts , the use in economy studies of sinking-fund depreciation plus interest on first cost would serve the purpose of helping to reconcile economy studies with the accounts of the enterprise . But this method of depreciation accounting , once used by a few regulated public utilities , has largely been abandoned . This method is subject to the objection that it gives an unrealistically high proportion of the total write off in the final years of the life of an asset . Or sinking-fund depreciation plus interest on first cost might tie an economy study to the financial policies of an enterprise if an actual sinking fund were to be established to recover an investment ( less salvage , if any ) in a fixed asset at the end of its life . But such sinking funds are rarely used . In most cases , therefore , this method should be viewed as a compound interest conversion unrelated to the accounts or to the establishment of any actual fund . Viewed in this way , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seem to the authors to have any advantage over the conventional method of computing the annual cost of capital recovery with a return illustrated throughout this book . Often the method using sinking-fund depreciation is harder to explain than the conventional method because critics may make such comments as " There will be no actual sinking fund " or " We are not actually using this method of depreciation accounting . " It is hard to give a satisfactory answer to these comments . Valid objections may be raised to this method where two interest rates are used . A discussion of these objections follows the explanation of the method of straight-line depreciation plus interest on first cost because this latter method is really a special case of the analysis using two interest rates . Straight-Line Depreciation Plus Interest on First Cost . If this method were used , the annual capital recovery cost of our $22,000 asset would be computed as follows : figure  | Except in the special case of a salvage value of 100% ( or more ) , this method invariably gives too high a figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the method indicates is needed to recover our proposed $22,000 investment with a 10% return is in fact sufficient to permit recovery with a return of about 14.5% . It has been pointed out that the straight-line method of depreciation accounting may be thought of as a limiting case of the sinking-fund method in which the interest rate on the sinking fund has been assumed to be 0% . Similarly , straight-line depreciation plus interest on first cost may be viewed as a special case of sinking-fund depreciation plus interest on first cost in which the sinking-fund interest rate is 0% . Objection to Annual Cost Calculations Using Two Interest Rates . We have computed three different figures for the annual cost of capital recovery with a 10% return for our proposed $22,000 investment in equipment . The conventional method using the capital recovery factor gave us a figure of $3,455 ; this same figure was obtained with 10% sinking-fund depreciation plus 10% interest on first cost . But 3% sinking-fund depreciation plus 10% interest on first cost gave us an annual capital recovery cost of $3,945 . And straight-line depreciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual objective of comparing equivalent annual costs in an economy study is to judge whether or not certain proposed investments will yield at least a minimum attractive rate of return . Assume that our proposed $22,000 asset is expected to be responsible for increased receipts ( or reduced disbursements ) of $3,800 a year for 10 years . This annual $3,800 plus the final $2,000 salvage value will in fact be sufficient to recover the $22,000 investment with interest at 12.1% . If we should compare this annual figure of $3,800 with our computed annual capital recovery cost of $3,455 , we would obtain the correct conclusion that the asset would yield more than a 10% return . But if we should compare the $3,800 with $3,945 or with $4,200 , we would obtain the incorrect conclusion that the proposed investment was not justified because it would not yield 10% . The reader may recall our discussion in Chapter 8 of the misleading conclusions obtainable from the calculation of an unknown rate of return by the Hoskold method , where reinvestment was assumed in an imaginary sinking fund bearing a low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using two interest rates ( i.e. , 3% and 10% , or 0% and 10% ) is the same one that we examined in Chapter 8 in our discussion of the Iloskuld method . Consider the following possible interpretation of a comparison of the $3,800 annual receipts with the $3,945 figure obtained by the method  | of 3% depreciation and 10% interest on first cost : " To judge whether our proposed $22,000 investment will give us a 10% return , the positive cash flow that it will cause is divided into two parts . One part , $2,200 , is 10% on our investment . The other part must be enough so that we can invest it at 3% and ( with the prospective terminal salvage value ) have $22,000 back at the end of the 10 years . As the $3,800 will not be enough to permit us to do this , we should view this proposed investment as yielding less than 10% . " The error here is that the merits of one investment , the proposed $22,000 asset , are to be judged on the basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 3% sinking fund . It is true that the asset , yielding 12.1% , and the sinking fund , yielding 3% , will not combine to give an over-all rate of return of 10% . A total of $3,945 a year will be needed for the combined rate of return to be 10% ; $3,800 is not enough . But , unless there is to be an actual 3% sinking fund investment that must be made if the asset is acquired , this deficiency of the combined rate of return below 10% has no bearing on the merits of the proposed investment in the asset . The foregoing two paragraphs may be altered so that they become a comment on the method of straight-line depreciation plus interest on first cost if 0% is substituted for 3% and $4,200 for $3,945 . Straight-Line Depreciation Plus Average Interest . This method of computing the annual cost of capital recovery with a return was widely used in economy studies in the United States in the 1930 's and 1940 's . Its use was illustrated in many examples and problems in the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this book . Where straight-line depreciation was actually to be used in the accounts and where the assumed life and salvage value in the economy study were the same as used in the accounts , the method had the advantage of helping to reconcile economy studies with the accounts of an enterprise . The method is a close approximation to true equivalent annual cost in certain cases but a poor approximation in others . With the decline in the application of straight-line depreciation accounting to new assets that started in 1954 in the United States , the use of this method no longer is justified on the basis of reconciling economy studies with the accounts except in a minority of cases . A good way for the reader to compare this method with the conventional method is to look back at Table 3 ? 1 ( page 26 ) which compares different schemes of repaying ( or recovering ) $10,000 in 10 years with interest at 6% . Plan III in this table corresponds to the conventional viewpoint on computing the annual cost of capital recovery with a return . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years will exactly repay $10,000 with 6% interest . Plan II is representative of another approach to the annual cost of capital recovery with interest . In this plan the annual payment on principal is uniform but the interest paid each year diminishes . With $10,000 paid in 10 equal installments , each installment is $1,000 . Interest the first year is $600 , which is 6% of the full $10,000 , but diminishes by $60 each year as the principal is repaid until in the tenth year it is only $60 . The average interest is $330 . These interest payments form an arithmetic progression the first term of which is Pi and the final term of which is ( P/n ) i . The average interest is the average of the first and last terms or 22 ( n + 1 The method of straight-line depreciation plus average interest always computes an average ( rather than an equivalent ) annual figure for a repayment plan devised along the lines of Plan II in Table 3-1 . In the general case with a first cost , P , an estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n years , and an interest rate , i , straight-line depreciation is P n L and average interest is ( P ? L ) ( 2 ) 1 n n 1 ) + Li . As applied to our $22,000 asset , the calculation is : figure This is somewhat less than the exact equivalent uniform annual cost , which we computed to be $3,455 . Limitations of Methods of Straight-Line Depreciation Plus Average Interest . Wherever the prospective terminal salvage is less than 100% of first cost , this method yields a figure for capital recovery cost that is too low . The method is an approximate one because it assumes the simple average of a diminishing series of payments to be the equivalent uniform annual payment . The error involved in its use increases with the length of the period of time considered and also increases with an increase in the interest rate . This variation is illustrated in Table 10-3 . Where annual cost methods are used to compare assets having approximately the same lives , where the lives are not too long , and where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often gives satisfactory results . The greater the disparity in the lives of assets being  | compared and the higher the minimum attractive rate of return , the more likely it is that economy studies using this method will yield misleading conclusions . Three Common Methods of Computing So-Called Rates of Return on Proposed Investments . There are many different ways in which prospective figures from the accounts are used to compute ratios that are alleged to be prospective rates of return . George Terborgh in the chapter entitled " Popular Rule-of-Thumb Tests of Investment Merit , " in Business Investment Policy 10 reports attending a conference where 14 companies reported 14 different methods of this type of calculation . The numerous schemes that the authors of this book have observed all seem to be variants of the following three methods : 1 . The ratio of prospective average annual profit after depreciation to original investment is alleged to be the prospective rate of return 10 George Terborgh , Business Investment Policy ( Washington , D.C. : Machinery and Allied Products Institute , 1958 ) , p. 33.  | on investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book " method . 2 . The ratio of prospective average annual profit after depreciation to the average book value is alleged to be the prospective rate of return on investment . Often this is referred to as the " average book " method . In many instances it gives a figure for rate of return that is double the figure given by the original book method , 3 . The figeres for prospective profit after depreciation for each year are divided by the prospective book value figures for the start of the respective year in the way that was illustrated in Table 10-1 . This division gives a series of ratios that are alleged to be year-byyear prospective rates of return . Conceivably , these rates might be averaged to give an over-all figure for rate of return . All these methods may be used to compute so-called rates of return either before or after income taxes . To simplify matters a bit , our present illustrations deal with the computation of rates of return before income taxes . The same objections that will be raised to the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are equally applicable to their use for after-tax calculations . Two Competing Investment Proposals . To illustrate these three methods and to demonstrate that all of them are inferior to correct compound interest methods , it is helpful to use some numerical examples . The following is adapted with some modifications from an illustration used by Horace G. Hill , Jr. , " for many years Budget Director of The Atlantic Refining Company . Two investment proposals , a vacuum still and a product terminal , are competing for limited funds in an oil company . Each requires an immediate disbursement of $110,000 , all of which will be capitalized on the books of account . In both cases the expected life is 10 years with zero salvage value . Straight-line depreciation will be used in the accounts . The estimated positive cash flow resulting from the vacuum still will be $38,000 the first year , $34,000 the second , and will diminish by $4,000 a year until it is $2,000 in the tenth year . The estimated positive cash flow resulting from the product terminal will be $5,000 in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase by $4,000 a year until it is $41,000 in the tenth year . With a trial-and-error present worth solution and with the aid of Table E-27 , the respective rates of return are coinputed as follows : it Horace G. Hill , Jr. , A New Method of Computing Rate of Return on Capital Expenditures , a pamphlet published privately by the author ( Berwyn , I'a. , 1953 ) .  | figure Interpolation indicates a rate of return of slightly over 19% . Product Terminal figure Interpolation indicates a rate of return of slightly less than 12% . The vacuum still therefore has a much higher prospective rate of return than the product terminal . The straight-line depreciation for each project will be $11,000 a year for 10 years , 10% of the original $110,000 investment . Let us assume that all cash flow except the original investment will affect the profit or loss figure on the books of accounts in the year when the cash flow occurs . Then the influence of each project on the prospective enterprise profit each year will be the positive cash flow minus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year-by-year influences of the two projects on the profit to be shown by the accounts is as follows : figure Rate of Return ( So-Called ) by Original Book Mefhod . In this method the average annual estimated profit is divided by the estimated original investment . The calculations for the two projects are : figure  | It is evident that this method of calculation ranks the rates of return from our two projects in the wrong order . This error is due to the failure of the method to give any weight whatsoever to the timing of the consequences of a project . The figure for " average profit , " the numerator of the fraction , fails to reflect the difference between a dollar in the near future and one in the distant future . It also is evident that the method has given us figures for rates of return that are less than the rates that we computed by correct compound interest methods . In most cases the original book method will understate the true rate of return . The difficulty here is that the denominator of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since it fails to reflect the concept that the year-by-year positive cash flow should be viewed in part as a recovery of the money originally disbursed . Rate of Return ( So-Called ) by Average Book Method . In this method the average annual estimated profit is divided by the average book value over the life of the project ( or possibly over the period of the economy study ) . As the book value in both of our projects declines uniformly from $110,000 to $0 over the 10-year period , the average book value in each is $55,000 . The calculations for the two projects are : figure This method also ranks the rates of return from our projects in the wrong order . Just as in the original book method , the numerator of the fraction gives no weight to the timing of the consequences of a project . The difference between the average book and original book methods is entirely in the denominator of the fraction that gives the computed rate of return . The use of an average figure in the denominator recognizes the viewpoint that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than on the date the project terminates . In our example , the denominators in the average book method are half those in the original book and the computed rates of return are double those of the original book . However , this two-to-one relationship between the two methods does not always exist . For example , it will not exist for a project that does not have zero salvage value . In the special case where the salvage value is 100% , the two methods give the same figure for rate of return . Rates of Return ( So-Called ) from Year-by-Year Estimated Profits and Book Values . In this method the estimated profit to be shown by the books for each year is divided by the computed book value for the  | start of the year in question ( or in some cases by the average of the start-of-year and end-of-year book values ) . Both the profit figures and the book values depend on the method of depreciation accounting to be used . This point is illustrated in Tables 10-4 and 10-5 , which show the application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two competing projects . The tables show calculations using straight-line depreciation and also using years-digits depreciation . Several aspects of this method of computing prospective rates of return make its use undesirable for economy studies . Some objections to this method , illustrated by Tables 10-4 and 10-5 , are as follows : 1 . Even if the year-by-year computed rates of return had any validity as a guide to decision making on proposed investments , the rates would be difficult to interpret . The many different rates computed for a single project are confusing ; it is much better to have a single figure indicating an over-all rate of return . It is evident from Tables 10-4 and 10-5 that this difficulty can not be resolved in a satisfactory manner by taking an average of the year-by-year rates . The vacuum still project , shown by correct methods to have a 19% return , has an average return of less than 2% when straight-line depreciation is assumed ; the product terminal  | project , shown by correct methods to have a 12% return , has an average return of nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method of computing rate of return before income taxes should not be influenced by the arbitrary time-allocation of the investment among accounting periods . Both Tables 10-4 and 10-5 bring out the point that the foregoing principle is violated by this method of computing rate of return . Both of our projects seem to look much better with the years-digits method than with the straight-line method of depreciation accounting . ( In Chapter 16 we shall see that when years-digits or decliningbalance depreciation is used for income tax purposes , the rate of return after income taxes usually will be a little higher than when straight-line depreciation is used for tax purposes . This after-tax difference in rate of return results from the influence of the depreciation accounting method on the timing of cash flow for income taxes . However , the effect of a depreciation accounting method on the timing of tax payments is an entirely different topic from the analysis of various methods of computing so-called rates of return. ) 3 . Like the original book and average book methods , the method of computing year-by-year rates of return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their merit . All three methods make the low-return project , the product terminal , seem to have a greater return than the high-return project , the vacuum still . General Comment on the Foregoing Three Methods of Computing Rate of Return . Our calculations of rates of return for our two projects have demonstrated that these methods , sometimes described as " approximate , " may give figures that actually are very poor approximations to the rate of return that would be computed by correct compound interest methods . We have also seen that the various methods give quite different answers . Although the correct figure for the vacuum still project was about 19% , our different calculations gave us answers of 8.2% , 16.4% , 1.7% , and 22.2% . Although the correct figure for the product terminal project was about 12% , our answers here were 10.9% , 21.8% , 54.2% , and 287.9% . We also noted that all of the methods ranked our two projects in the wrong order ; the low-return project seemed to be better than the highreturn one . Of course it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorrect ranking of proposed investments . Ordinarily the chief cause of an incorrect ranking is the failure of the methods to give proper weight to the timing of cash flow . Our example comparing the vacuum still with the product terminal was chosen to stress this particular weakness of these common methods of computing rates of return ; the vacuum still had most of its positive cash flow in the early years of its life whereas the product terminal had the largest part of its positive cash flow in the final years of its life . However , our example comparing the vacuum still and the product terminal did not illustrate a quite different weakness of these three methods . In a correct calculation of rate of return before income taxes by compound interest methods , it is immaterial whether a cash disburseinent is to be capitalized on the books of account or whether it is to be charged as an expense in the year when it occurs . But the three methods that we have discussed all use book value ( original or average or the current year 's ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of return . " Book value " ordinarily refers only to items that are capitalized on the books of account . Thus two projects having identical cash flows might appear to have quite different rates of return if the two projects are to be treated differently in the accounts . This type of error may lead to incorrect ranking of projects and may also increase the inherent errors in the rates of return computed by these three methods . Why Are Incorrect Methods of Computing Rates of Return in Common Use ? A reader of this book who is not already employed in an organization using one of these methods may well ask why methods  | of analysis that are so erratic and unreliable are so widely used . This is a good question to which the authors are unable to give a fully satisfactory answer . George Terborgh 12 refers to these and similar methods of analysis as " really industrial folklore , handed down from one generation of management to the next . They have no scientific rationale , no legitimate intellectual parentage . " In some instances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people who use them are not aware that any better methods are available . But there are many cases where analysts consciously reject compound interest methods of computing rates of return in favor of the original book or average book method . The choice of book methods usually is defended by the following arguments : 1 . Book methods are alleged to be easier to apply . 2 . Book methods are alleged to be easier to explain to others . The greater ease of application of book methods is not a valid argument for their use . There are many economy studies in which compound interest methods can be applied as easily as book methods , once the compound interest methods are understood by the analyst . Moreover , even where compound interest methods require , say , an extra half-hour of an analyst 's time , this extra time usually is trivial in relation to the many hours of time that have been spent on the gathering of data to be used in the economy study . In many organizations it is true that the book methods are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding of compound interest , methods that seem to be tied to the books of account can be explained more readily than methods that use the mathematics of compound interest . The answer to this argument is that , as we have pointed out , book methods lead to erratic and unreliable answers that can not be trusted as a basis for action ; compound interest methods should be used in spite of the greater difficulty of explaining them . A pertinent comment on this subject is made by Ray I. Reul as follows : 13 Another obstacle to the acceptance of an objective method ( of computing rate of return ) is the desire of nearly all business executives to find a method of evaluation that will be directly comparable to accounting evaluations of current operations . I would like to , too ! But I know it can not be done . It is time the inevitable was faced . The search for such a method is like looking for a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow ? foredoomed to failure . It is an impossibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of the same footnote 12 Terborgh , op. cit. , p. 28. 13 Ray I. Reul , " Profitability Index for Investments , " Harvard Business Review , XXXV , No. 4 ( July ? August , 1957 ) , 116 ? 32.  | words , " rate of return on investment , " to describe entirely different concepts . What Meaning Shall Be Attached to the Phrase " Rate of Return " as Applied to Proposed Investments ? In our initial discussion of equivalence in Chapter . 3 , we examined a loan transaction in which an investor exchanged an initial cash disbursement of $10,000 for the prospect of end-of-year cash receipts of $1,358.68 a year for 10 years . It was shown ( in the tabulation for Plan III , Table 3 ? 1 ) that this series of receipts enables the investor to recover his investment with exactly 6% interest per annum . It might also be stated that he is scheduled to recover his investment with a 6% rate of return . This is the only sense of rate of return that is a sound and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the only sense in which the phrase is used in this book . Where one of the methods based on the depreciation accounts is employed , we use the phrase " socalled rate of return . " ( It may be of interest to apply the various methods based on the books of account to our simple case of the $10,000 investment recovered at 6% interest by $1,358.68 a year for 10 years . By the original book method , the rate of return appears to be 3.59% . By the average book method , it appears to be 7.17% . The year-by-year method depends on the scheme used for a time allotment of the investment among the 10 years ; if a straight-line allotment is used , the return appears to vary from 3.59% the first year to 35.87% the 10th year . ) Arguments on the silly and unanswerable question " What does rate of return really mean ? " have been so heated in some industries that certain industrial writers have tried to avoid the question by coining other phrases for rate of return obtained by correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Profitability Index " or " PI " in this meaning . Weaver and Reilly have suggested the phrase " interest rate of return " to be used in this same sense.14 Some Aspects of Depreciation Accounting Not Developed in This Book . We have already mentioned that the various types of statistical analysis of physical property mortality are not explained here , and that most of the technicalities of multiple-asset accounting have been avoided . Some other topics that we have omitted are as follows : figure footnote 14 J. B. Weaver and R. J. Reilly , " Interest Rate of Return for Capital Expenditure Evaluation , " Chemical Engineering Progress , LII , No. 10 ( October , 1956 ) , 405-12.  | fiscal year . The question arises regarding the depreciation charge to be made for the remainder of the year . Because 9 months of the year remain , it might seem reasonable to charge 9/12 of the depreciation computed for the first full year of life under the depreciation accounting method selected . However , such a practice would require the application of a different fraction to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A more common practice is to use some type of averaging convention . The so-called half-year convention is a common one ; all assets are given a half-year 's depreciation charge during their acquisition year regardless of the time of the year when they were acquired . Another convention is to charge a full year 's depreciation for the acquisition year for the assets acquired during the first half of the year and no depreciation for those acquired during the second half . In our examples we have , in effect , assumed that all assets are acquired at the start of a fiscal ( and tax ) year and that a full year 's depreciation is charged during the year of acquisition . 2 . There are various possible accounting treatments of gross amounts realized from salvage values and of costs of removing assets when retired . The way these matters are to be treated may influence the depreciation rate to be used and will determine the type of entry to be made on retirement . 3 . There are differences between depreciation accounting where each year 's acquisitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate account and where all year 's acquisitions of the class of asset are merged together in a so-called open-end account . 4 . It will rarely be true that average lives and salvage values will turn out exactly as estimated . Various problems arise associated with re-estimates of remaining lives and salvage values for existing assets . These problems differ with different depreciation accounting methods . One purpose of mentioning the foregoing topics is to make it plain to our readers that our approach to depreciation accounting here is necessarily a simplified one ? that there are many facets to the subject that we do not have space to explore . Another purpose is to suggest depreciation accounting and the tax aspects of depreciation as appropriate subjects for study by persons who are responsible for making or reviewing economy studies . Although an introduction to engineering economy can be made with simplified assumptions about depreciation accounting , a more sophisticated understanding of the subject will be helpful in certain types of economy studies . The authors ' views regarding the selection of a method of depreciation accounting are briefly stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax aspects of depreciation .  | 10-1 .

" " A slow sort of country ! " said the Queen . " Now , here , you see , it takes all the running you can do , to keep in the same place . If you want to get somewhere else , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? LEWIs CARROLL 1 In many examples and problems up to this point , we have stipulated a figure for i ? , the minimum attractive rate of return , without any discussion of why the particular value of i ? was selected . In this chapter we examine some of the troublesome issues that arise in selecting a minimum attractive rate of return . We start with two examples that will help to emphasize that decision criteria often are related to a limitation on the funds available for capital investment . EXAMPLE 11-1 . CRITERIA FOR INVESTMENT EVALUATION IN A CERTAIN CLOSELY HELD CORPORATION Facts of the Case . Three members of a family held slightly more than half of the stock of a successful small company which we shall call the ABC Manufacturing Company . This company had no long-term debt . These controlling stockholders were active officers of the corporation . As the company made capital goods , its profits fluctuated considerably ; although its over-all profit record had been excellent , there had been occasional loss years . The proposal was made to expand by manufacturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was a good prospective rate of return . However , all the moneys for plant investment that became available each year from retained earnings and depreciation charges were being absorbed by replacements and plant modernization in connection with the present product line . A substantial investment in plant and equipment was needed to undertake the new product line . Therefore , it was necessary to raise new capital if this proposal for business expansion were to be accepted . Investigation disclosed that this capital could be raised either by the sale 1 Lewis Carroll , Through the Looking Glass , chap . 2. inn  | of new stock to certain persons interested in the company or by a 10-year loan from an individual investor . The proposal to make the new products was finally rejected by the three controlling stockholders on the grounds that neither type of financing was acceptable to them . The objection to the sale of stock was that the three stockholders would no longer have a majority stock interest that made it certain they could control the company 's affairs . The 10-year loan also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one limiting dividend payments while the loan was outstanding ) . However , their chief objection to the loan was that the required annual payments of principal and interest made them much more vulnerable to any business recession that might cause one or more loss years . In effect , this decision , based on considerations related to financing , caused the rejection of an investment proposal ( plant expansion ) yielding a high prospective rate of return even though other investment proposals ( replacements and modernization ) were being accepted yielding lower rates of return . EXAMPLE 11 ? 2 . CRITERIA FOR INVESTMENT DECISIONS IN AN UNDERFINANCED MANUFACTURING BUSINESS Facts of the Case . Two partners purchased a small manufacturing enterprise . They used their entire personal savings for a payment to the former proprietor of half the purchase price . The remainder of the purchase price was to be paid from a stipulated percentage of the profits . During its initial years , the partnership was always short of cash . The partners saw many chances to reduce production costs by moderate outlays for new equipment or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortage and because it was impracticable to bring new money into the business , every proposal had to be judged primarily with relation to its effect on the short-term cash position of the business . During the first year , it was not possible to adopt any proposal that ? in terms of cash flow ? would not " pay for itself " in three months . The Concept of Capital Rationing in Relation to the Minimum Attractive Rate of Return . Resources available for new investment in capital assets during any given period of time usually are limited even though the constraints may not be as severe as those in Examples 11 ? 1 and 11 ? 2 . Also , technological progress and an expanding economy make it common for the total of the proposals for investment in new assets to be considerably greater than the total of available funds . For example , assume that the manufacturing company of Example 11 ? 1 had $90,000 of funds for its capital budget for a given year and that there were investment proposals for plant modernization and expansion totaling $207,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple example it is evident that the $90,000 of available funds would have been exhausted by Projects U , Y , Z , and S. It follows that the minimum rate of return that was attractive was 15% , the prospective rate on Project S. If an investment had been made in any project yielding less than 15% ( X , T , V , W , or some other project not tabulated ) ,  | the effect would have been to eliminate the possibility of investing in some project that was expected to yield 15% or more . Validity of the Capital Rationing Concept . Matters are rarely as simple as implied by the foregoing discussion . For example , the alternative of securing new outside capital often is available . Moreover , it may be impracticable to array all the proposals for capital expenditures during the coming year and to be sure that no other good proposals ? now unforeseen ? will develop during the year . Even without outside financing , the total funds that can be made available for capital expenditures may not be fixed absolutely but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In choosing among available projects , it often is desirable to apply supplementary criteria in addition to prospective rate of return . The differences in the duration of the consequences of the various proposals may be deemed to be an important consideration . There may be no group of projects that will exactly absorb the available funds . Various aspects of these topics are discussed throughout the remainder of this book and the whole subject is considered more critically in Chapter 21 . Nevertheless , the principle is entirely sound that the minimum attractive rate of return ought to be chosen with the objective of making the best possible use of a limited resource . This resource is , of course , the money that can be made available for investment in capital assets and closely related items . If the consequence of making an investment  | yielding 10% is to forego some other investment that would yield 20% , it is not sensible to make the 10% investment . The high figures for i ? that so often are used in competitive industry are based in part on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is prospective differences among alternatives that are relevant in their comparison . The prospective rate of return from a proposed investment should be based on the difference between making the investment and not making it . The " With or Without " Viewpoint with Reference to Prospective Rates of Return on Investments in Competitive Industry . The president of a large manufacturing company in a highly competitive industry was discussing various matters with the engineer responsible for review and analysis of investment proposals . The president made comments along the following line : In our company , we approve many proposals for investments aimed at cost reduction . Generally speaking , the proposals approved show prospective rates of return of 16% or more after income taxes . When we post-audit the results of these investments , we conclude that the cost reductions realized have been , on the average , somewhat greater than we forecast in computing the prospective rates of return . Nevertheless , our average overall rate of return on investment is only about 8% after taxes and does not seem to be improved by these numerous cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The president was , in fact , describing a condition that reasonably may be expected to be the normal state of affairs in competitive industry . The difference between making the investments in cost reduction equipment and not making these investments was measured by the 16% rate of return . However , under the stress of competition , the favorable consequences of these good investments were shared among the owners of the enterprise , its employees , and its customers . Wage and salary rates to the company 's employees were increased from year to year ; prices of the industry 's product were reduced ( if measured in monetary units of constant purchasing power ) and the quality of the product was improved . In spite of the fact that the owners of the enterprise did not keep all the return yielded by the cost reduction equipment , the 16% rate was a valid measure of the productivity of this equipment from their point of view . If their company had not installed the modern equipment but its competitors had done so , competition would still have made it necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also have been necessary to raise wage and salary rates because such rates are responsive to industry-wide conditions , not merely to conditions in one particular company . Under conditions of competition the over-all rate
