An odd little insect is the botfly . It irritates cattle and has no bristles . Odder still is a nameless fly , distant cousin to the housefly , whose larvae live by crawling into other insects , such as Japanese beetles and gypsy moths , and eating them from the inside . Between these two flies science recognized no kinship , but the Smithsonian Institution 's Raymond C. Shannon guessed better . He went to southwestern Argentina , climbed high , searched long . He found a fly . Back to the Smithsonian in Washington he hastened . There Entomologist Charles Henry Tyler Townsend examined the Shannon fly , pronounced it the missing link between botfly and parasitic fly , a hitherto unknown phenomenon , a botfly with bristles . Entomologist Shannon 's find , enthused Entomologist Townsend , is " the most important oestromuscoid discovery of the 20th Century . "
