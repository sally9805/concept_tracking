txt After fighting for five hours over items totaling less than $57,447,397 of a total carried in the independent office bill of $1,003,192,195 , the House late this afternoon completed consideration of the bill and was ready to pass it when Representative Patman of Texas demanded a record vote on an amendment which added $301,000 to the Federal Trade Commission item . There was virtually no debate on the $966,838,634 appropriation to finance the veterans ' administration in the next fiscal year . Every appropriation in the bill save the huge veterans ' item was debated in the name of " economy , " but no amendments were introduced to cut the total for the ex-soldiers . The bill will pass tomorrow morning immediately following the disposition of Mr. Patman 's demand . Mr. Patman , who is the leader of the forces demanding the payment of the bonus to the soldiers , wants the amendment rejected as a measure of economy . Fight Is Non-Partisan . The fight to cut in half the appropriation for the Federal Trade Commission was non-partisan , the two sides of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action of the committee in recommending $510,000 , or a little less than half the total submitted by the bureau of the budget . Two amendments were proposed , both from the Democratic side . One was by Representative Cochran of Missouri , increasing the appropriation to $1,000,000 , and the other by Representative Bankhead of Alabama , increasing it to $811,416 . Mr. Bankhead explained that his amendment omitted the $250,000 carried in the original estimate to finance new investigations by the committee , one of them the financial practices of corporations . These investigations should be left , he said , to the decision of the Roosevelt administration . Representative Wood of Indiana , ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations , was in favor of abolishing the commission , as were also Representative Blanton of Texas and Representative Patman . Mr. Wood declared the commission " has a habit of sticking its nose Into every conceivable business , " adding that " if there ever was a time in the history of the country when we should give business a rest , that time is now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not on record a single prosecution as a result of investigations made by the commission . On the other hand , Representatives La Guardia of New York , Summers of Washington , Woodrum of Virginia and Cochran of Mis- souri defended the commission . Mr. La Guardia predicted that President-elect Roosevelt.would put new life into the body and by so doing " prevent a repetition of the wholesale larcenies of which the American people have been the victims . " After defeating Mr. Cochran 's $1,000,000 amendment by a vote of 90 to 70 , the House adopted the Bankhead $811,000 amendment by 111 to 85 . With the Federal Trade Commission disposed of , Representative Schafer of Wisconsin took advantage of a lull to talk for economy . His target was Representative of Kansas , who in a speech had urged " more and better economy . " The Democrats , Mr. Schafer charged , were running wild so far as money spending was concerned and he declared that among those who were not over-exerting themselves to stop them was Mr. . Galleries Roar at Show . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted his predictions of the dire times to follow the inauguration of Mr Roosevelt . Both sides of the chamber egged him on as he moved up and down in front of the Speaker 's chair , while the galleries roared their appreciation . But as far as economy was concerned , the outburst bore no fruit . When quiet was restored , the House proceeded to approve one by one the various appropriations carried in the bill . There was a motion to strike out the $7,137,639 appropriation for the Interstate Commerce Commission , which was rejected by a storm of noes , and a short but lively debate over the Shipping Board item . One objection was that it was against " economy as practiced in Congress " to put a caretaker on government-owned ships which are laid up in various ports and out of commission .
