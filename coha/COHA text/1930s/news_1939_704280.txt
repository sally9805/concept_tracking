txt Status of Armed Vessels Definite Ruling on Merchantmen With Guns Viewed as Necessary To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The confusion in regard to armed merchantmen is astonishing . Few problems contributed so much toward our entry into the World War and yet that problem has been allowed to remain unresolved . It is extraordinary , also , that the two utterly opposed views in regard to these ships both claim to derive their justification from the opinion of Chief Justice Marshall in the Nereide case ( 9 Cranch 389 ) , while in fact that opinion gives no warrant for either view . One school considers armed merchantmen to be outright warships . It observes simply that they are combatant vessels and fails to consider that they are not commissioned cruisers , that they are not armed for offense and therefore can not convert a neutral port into a naval base , which is the primary reason for the rigid restrictions on commissioned warships . The State Department , on the other hand , observes that these vessels are armed for defense only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It admits further that they may legally use their guns and that , if captured , members of the crew have the status of prisoners of war . Anomaly Observed So far the department is on firm ground . But then it proceeds to deny that these ships may be sunk on sight . The department is therefore in the position of insisting that these vessels are lawful combatants when they are firing , but innocent noncombatants when they are being fired upon , Such a dual character is absurd and unknown to martial law . It is impossible for any person to be both a combatant and a noncombatant , impossible to shift from one role to the other instantaneously , whether the change is to be at its own whim or at the whim of the enemy . In the case of an armed merchant ship we do not have a vessel of dual character . The vessel is a combatant . Whether she is armed for offense or defense affects her position toward a neutral but not toward her enemy . Being defensively armed means merely that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It does not make her a noncombatant . She carries on commerce , to be sure , but she carries on that commerce by force . The neutral can give her cargo , but the enemy can take account of her guns . Because she is a lawful combatant vessel , an armed merchantman has , of course , the right to sink a submarine on sight , but equally a submarine has a right to sink her on sight . In war no one can be permitted to use arms , whether in offense ordefense , and still be immune from attack by arms . Particulars of weapons or consequence of a shot are immaterial . No question of who can fire first , or the different caliber or type of arms can be admitted . One can not promulgate a theory that artillery must not fire on infantry , that ten men must not shoot at three . These things may appeal to humane sentiments ; but the more humane sentiments are allowed to cloud the cold principles of martial law , the more bloody and less humane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgings of some very learned men , there is no reason for us to close our ports to these vessels , but there is every reason to recognize them for what at times we admit them to he , combatants . We should consider them , like tankers and carriers of explosives , too dangerous for passengers of any nationality to use . We should , in recognizing their combatant character , also recognize that as a consequence any American citizen in their crews is enlisted in fact in a belligerent naval service and subject to all the hazard of such enlistment . If we do not , one of these days an armed British or French liner is going to be torpedoed without warning and we are going to be forced to decide in the passion of the moment whether we like to have passengers sail out of New York to sudden death at sea . We may then find it more difficult to detect the principles involved . We should not again get ourselves in the dangerous position of insisting as a formal diplomatic position that these vessels are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being fired upon . LAWRENCE BRowN . New York , Oct. 31 , 1939 . Self-Frightened Belligerents To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Paradoxical as it may seem , I hold that the halting pace at which the war progresses is due to the overequipment of fiendish weapons . None of the combatants quite dares to turn loose a fleet of bombing planes upon the other . Imagine the world-wide emotional outburst at the wanton destruction of precious art and literary treasures , these being in a spiritual or social sense the common property of all mankind . And all this on top of wholesale slaughter of civilians engaged in their daily tasks . Moreover , destruction can not win a war , unless the victims are made to surrender , which I can not conceive the British or the French people are apt to do . The warring nations would therefore be well advised to get together to discuss terms of peace . I know there is a well-founded reluctance to negotiate with the Hitler type . But , then , there is a difference between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to win the war . The one in the middle , public opinion , will be the victor . Thus , there is a good chance for civilization to survive . GABRIEL WELLS . New York , Oct. 31 , 1939 . Misconceptions of Propaganda To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The tendency to brand as harmful propaganda addresses or articles by men such as Lord Lothian and Alfred Duff Cooper , outstanding representatives of a nation with which we have a great kinship , politically , spiritually and otherwise , indicates a popular misconception of the much discussed dangers of propaganda . I might go farther and say that it betrays the unripeness of some people for the much heralded free speech . The dangers of propaganda do not lie in open and clear statements by responsible men who have been contributing for years to the discussions of current questions . On the contrary , let them all talk it out , so long as we know the authors or lecturers and how to evaluate them . The danger of propaganda is to be feared when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ostensibly by citizens of the United/States who wish to " sell us " nazism , communism or fascism under the cloak of politico-economic doctrines . It is even more dangerous when a large number of these " American " propagandists are known to take their orders from abroad . I suppose there is nothing to do but to tolerate them under our Bill of Rights until they shall have committed some overt acts , as they generally do when " der Tag " arrives . JACOB FISHMAN , New York , Oct. 31 , 1939 . American Objectives Cited Former Governor Pinchot Would Re . peal Embargo , Keep Us Out of War I To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : There are , as I see it , two things practically all Americans are for in this war : We want to stay out of it and we want Hitler stopped . We can , I am convinced , get both of these things by repealing the embargo and enacting cash and carry . The best way for us to keep out of the war is to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to win the war , first because it is right and also because that is the best thing for the United States . This war will decide whether we shall continue to live in peace and security or whether we must be armed and ready to keep the unbearable Hitler system . ? tyranny , paganism , persecution , bloodpurges , faith-breaking and conquest by force  --  out of this hemisphere . The Nazis have already given unmistakable notice of their desire to dominate certain South American countries . Allied victory will bring no threat to peace in the Americas . But would it he good for our peace if a despotism whose law is the law of the wolf pack , which hates freedom , despises religion , looks on small nations as mere loot , and keeps no faith , should try to extend its military rule to Canada and the French and British colonies in America ? One may not like England or France ? because of imperialism , past wars , war debts , or whatever . But suppose burglars were breaking into the houses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always led a model life and was personally objectionable , would that make one side with the burglars ? This is a free country . We keep our word . We want to live with and trade with free peoples who keep their word also . We are neutral and we must stay neutral . But it is no more unneutral to repeal the embargo , which will help the Allies , than to maintain the embargo , which is helping Hitler right now . I am for America first , last and all the time . I am for staying out of the war . Cash and carry and no embargo is the answer . GIFFORD PINCHOZ . Milford , Pa. , Oct. 31 , 1939 . Acrobatic Communists TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : A small item that appeared in THR TIMES fifteen years ago seems to he very appropriate now . It tells of a Hollander named Takkenberg who had wagered that he would somersault from Holland to Marseilles within fifteen months . At the time of the dispatch he had somersaulted front Holland to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Communist party both here and abroad , then Takkenberg 's extraordinary journey is bound to be recalled . Certainly Takkenberg could not possibly have turned as many somersaults as the Communists . It seems that Takkenberg had padding on both his head and back for protection . In this respect the Communists are unprepared . JOHN L. STRYKER . Madison , N. J. , Oct. 28 , 1939 . Not All Evil To THE EDITOR OF THE Nsw YORK TIMES : Representative Dies said recently : ' " We were living in a critical period in which democracy was being seriously challenged by the forces of atheism and materialism . " Is anybody doubting the fine character and the great patriotism of men like Robert Ingersoll , Thomas Edison , Clarence Darrow and thousands of other Americans who have been vital forces of atheism and materialism ? The real danger to American democracy seems to be the hypocrisy of the professional politicians . FRED GEORGE Iwo . New York , Oct. 29 , 1939 . Counterfeit Consideration To THE EDITOR OF THE Nsw YORK TIMES : Makers of thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bail because they only " sold " counterfeit bills to others who actually " passed " them . The law says that it is a crime to pass counterfeit money , but if you sell it you get off nearly scot-free . Does this Increase our respect for law ? R. W. G. W. New York , Oct. 30 , 1939.
