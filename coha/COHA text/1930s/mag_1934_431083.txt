 | The Inhumanity of Children Condensed from " Of Human Bondage " Somerset Maugham " I 'LL PUT YOU in the small dormitory for the present . You 'll like that , wo n't you ? You wo n't feel so strange . Come along now , I 'll show you the playground . " The headmaster was an enormous man with a great red beard ; to nine-year-old Philip Carey he seemed gigantic . He swept out of the room with giant strides , and Philip hurriedly limped behind him . Outside in the playground one small boy was wandering about , kicking up the gravel as he walked . " Hullo , Venning , " bellowed the headmaster in the roaring voice that struck terror in Philip 's heart , " here 's a new boy . He 's older than you , so do n't you bully him . " He glared amicably at the two children and left them . The small boy came forward . " What 's your name ? " " Carey . " " What 's your father ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mother wash ? " " My mother 's dead , too . I live with my uncle . " " Well , did she wash ? " " Yes , " said Philip , indignantly . " She was a washerwoman , then ? " " No , she was n't . " " Then she did n't wash . " The little boy crowed with delight at his success . Then he caught sight of Philip 's feet . " What 's the matter with your foot ? " Philip instinctively tried to withdraw it from sight ; he hid it behind the one which was whole .  | " I 've got a club-foot , " he answered . " How did you get it ? " " I 've always had it . " " Let 's have a look . " " No . " " Do n't then . " The boy accompanied the words with a sharp kick on Philip 's shin , which Philip did not expect nor guard against . The pain made him gasp , but greater than the pain was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . While Philip was nursing his shin a third boy appeared , and they left him . In a little while he noticed that the pair were talking about him , looking at his feet . He grew hot and uncomfortable . But others arrived , and they began to talk about their doings during the holidays . A few new boys appeared , and with these presently Philip found himself talking . He was shy and nervous , anxious to make himself pleasant , but he could not think of anything to say . One boy asked hull whether he could play cricket . " No , " answered Philip . " I 've got a club-foot . " The boy looked down quickly and reddened . He was too shy to apologize and looked at Philip awkwardly . Next morning when the clanging of the bell awoke Philip he looked round his cubicle in astonishment . Then he remembered where he was . He got up and knelt to say his prayers . It was cold , and he shivered a little ; but his uncle , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to God if he said them in his nightshirt than if he waited till he was dressed . He was beginning to realize that he was the creature of a God who appreciated the discomfort of his worshipers . After breakfast and classes , the whole school rushed noisily onto the playground . The boys stationed themselves along opposite walls to play Pig in the Middle . The old boys ran from wall to wall while the new boys tried to catch them . When one was seized he became a prisoner and , turning sides , helped to catch those still free . Philip saw a boy running past and tried to catch him , but his limp gave him no chance ; the runners , taking their opportunity , made straight for the ground he covered . Then one of them had the brilliant idea of imitating Philip 's clumsy run . Others saw it and began to laugh ; then they all copied ; and they ran round Philip , limping grotesquely , screaming in their treble voices with shrill laughter . They choked with merriment . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always fell . They laughed all the louder . Philip was completely scared . He could not make out why they were laughing at him . He stood stupidly while the boys ran round him , mimicking and laughing ; they shouted to him to try and catch them ; but he did not move . He did not want them to see him run any more . He was using all his strength to keep from crying . That night when they were undressing , a boy called Singer put his head in Philip 's cubicle . " I say , let 's look at your foot , " he said . " No , " answered Philip . He jumped into bed quickly . " Do n't say no to me , " said Singer . " Come on , Mason . " Another boy slipped in . They made for Philip and tried to tear the bed-clothes off him , but he held them tightly . " Why ca n't you leave me alone ? " he cried . " Why do n't you show us your foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperation Philip clenched his fist and hit , but the boy seized his arm and began to turn it . " Do n't , do n't , " said Philip , " you 'll break my arm . " " Stop still then and put out your foot . " The boy gave the arm another wrench . " All right . I 'll do it , " said Philip . He put out his foot . Singer looked  | curiously at the deformity . " Is n't it beastly ? " Another came in and looked too . " Ugh , " he said in disgust . " Is it hard ? " He touched it with his forefinger , cautiously . Suddenly they heard the headmaster 's tread on the stairs . They threw the clothes back on Philip and dashed like rabbits into their cubicles . Mr. Watson came into the dormitory , and looked into two or three of the rooms . The little boys were safely in bed . Mr. Watson put out the light and went out . Singer called out to Philip but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillow so that his sobbing should be inaudible . He was not crying for the pain , nor for the humiliation , but with rage at himself because , unable to stand the torture , he had put out his foot of his own accord . And then he felt the misery of his life . It seemed to his childish mind that this unhappiness must go on forever .
