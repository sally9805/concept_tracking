txt It is easy to understand the motives of the leaders of last year 's Fusion party in New York in announcing that they propose to run candidates of their own this Fall in every Senate and Assembly district of this city . They point to the rebuffs which the Legislature at Albany gave them during the recent session . Bill after bill urged by the municipal authorities , in the interest of economy and better government , was either rejected or mutilated . The argument is , therefore , that the Fusion administration of the city can not hope for a legislative fair deal unless it is able to elect its own representatives in the State Senate and Assembly . Naturally , this political logic seems to gain strength from the necessity of choosing a new Controller in consequence of the untimely and lamented death of Mr. CUNNINGHAM . The courts will very likely be called upon to decide whether it is necessary to fill that vacancy by an election next November . If a new Controller must be elected then , there certainly ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exigency would quickly restore the spirit and the organization of last year 's municipal campaign . The fear would be that Tammany might seize the opportunity to " come back " to the extent of electing a Controller who would be a thorn in the side of Mr. LAGUARDIA , and upset the present full control of the Board of Estimate by the Mayor and the Fusionists . But any joint campaign to keep the Controllership away from the paw of the Tiger would have to be nonpartisan , entirely disentangled from the election of State officers . Such a revival of Fusion would obviously revise the most delicate and tactful handling , and would appear to be made more difficult if , at the same time , a complete Fusion ticket for members of the Legislature from this city were in the field . Before a decision to place it there is made , there ought to be a careful survey of the political possibilities and dangers . The regular party lines are certain to be drawn taut this year . The Republicans will make a dead set to defeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight hard to retain control of the State Senate and to make gains in the Assembly , calling upon the voters in this way to uphold the hands of President RoOsEVELT . Thus the conditions of an effective Fusion in this city will not be so favorable as they were in 1933 . The Republicans of New York , whether in or out of their party organization , could not be expected loyally to give their votes in such strength to Fusion as they did last year . It is thus clearly a case for prudence , for estimating tendencies and weighing consequences before raising the Fusion banner all over the city as is now proposed . Unless Mayor LAGUARDIA should change his resolve and pledge to keep his administration entirely out of politics , and to have nothing to do himself even with the Fusion party , its success in a campaign going it alone would obviously be , for this reason and for the others mentioned , highly doubtful .                    @
