txt For the first time in its existence the Association to Promote Proper Housing for Girls is making an appeal for funds for its clubs . The present emergency has cut its income from every source , and many more girls than usual are asking for cheap rooms and other aid . The purpose has been to give girls homes which they enjoy and to prove that such homes can be fully self-supporting . Now the difficulty lies in the lack of employment for the girls . When they become self-supporting again the clubs will not have to call for outside help . All they need is a fund to tide them over , and because the girls and the club leaders work together with such intelligence and cordial feeling , they deserve the lift they are asking for . No social organization in the city reveals quicker , more gracious adaptability to the changing needs of the group it is designed to benefit . Striking evidence of its capacity for suiting itself to altered conditions is presented in the annual report . It does not share the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the old , benevolent " lines .

Now she has her choice of living in a clubhouse where she can do her own cooking or go to meals served in the dining room . She does not have to sit on the high stoop all night if she gets home later than 10 , but has her own latch-key .

It is remarkable that one group , Club , has been able to remain fully self-supporting even through the depression by drawing on its own reserve funds . An innovation which may startle some conventional persons but which is working admirably has been instituted at Club Marshall . One of its group of houses has been turned over to men . It was done partly because many of the girls ' callers had requested such a move after pleasant evenings spent at the club . " A " solution of the loneliness they had " previously experienced has come " about through the new social con " teak from which girls all Mil ea " men reap the benefits . " The association believes that this experiment has been so successful that " to meet " the housing problem of the young " by the segregation of the sexes in " large houses is no longer wise , but " a growing mistake .
