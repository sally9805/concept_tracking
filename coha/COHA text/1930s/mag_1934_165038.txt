The agonized wail of police sirens called Manhattan 's attention to one of the most important art events of the season last week . Nearly 4,000 persons jammed their way into the Museum of Modern Art with a popping of flashlights and a grinding of sound cameras that made it look like a Hollywood opening . Totally unable to see what the museum had to show , the guests milled slowly up &; down stairs and looked at one another . Besides Soviet Ambassador Alexander Antonovich Troyanovsky , they included : Mary Pickford , Otto H. Kahn , Dolores Del Rio , Leopold Stokowski , Henry Seidel Canby , Lord Duveen , Frank Sullivan , Katharine Hepburn , the young ladies of the Ballet Russe , Charles A. Lindbergh and most of the Rockefellers . Most critics went back next morning for a quieter look at the best exhibition of stage decor and costume ever held in the U. S. : 700 costume plates , plans , drawings and illuminated stage models , tracing the development of theatre art from 16th Century Venice to Broadway 1933 . Assembler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vary as to whether Norman Bel Geddes , " Lee Simonson , Robert Edmond Jones or Jo Mielziner is the ablest scene designer in the U. S. But all critics agree that swarthy Artist Simonson is the most rationally articulate . A. B. Magna cum Laude at Harvard ( 1908 ) , he loves a well-chosen word as well as a shrewdly-drawn line . Onetime editor of Creative Art , he has written innumerable essays , delivered hundreds of lectures . His latest book . The Stage is Set , * is not only a beautifully written history of the art of stage decoration but a Ph . D. thesis full of assorted bits of original research ranging from the itemized cost of production of a 15th Century mystery play ( $1,000 to $3,000 ; to the bulk of a Sunday edition of the New York Times ( 459 sq . feet , 2 lb. 6 oz . ) . To carry scholasticism still farther , the elaborate catalog of the present exhibition which Assembler Simonson and the Museum of Modern Art have published contains no less than six learned introductions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a history of the development of stage design , not a history of the drama . The work of all the best known U. S. designers was represented but , more often than not , settings for their best known plays were lacking . People looked in vain for Robert Edmond Jones 's The Man Who Married a Dumb Wife , The Jest , Mourning Becomes Electra ; for Bel Geddes ' Miracle or Lysistrata ; for Jo Mielziner 's Street Scene .
