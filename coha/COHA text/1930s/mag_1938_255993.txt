Much as they love and respect other Christians , Baptists love more the saving grace of baptism , the freedom of worship without the ministrations of a priesthood . Baptists may well be the most sizable group of Christians who will not march toward world church unity with the World Council of Churches ( see col. 2 ) . Last week in Richmond . Va. , 5,000 " messengers " ( delegates ) to the Southern Baptist Convention representing 5,000,000 Baptists in 18 States , applauded two frank statements of the Baptist position on unity . A committee thumbed down " any federation , council or what not that would hinder us in the full and free preaching of the whole counsel of God . " In the opening sermon , to which Baptists annually look forward as representing the very best tradition of Southern preaching , Dr. John Richard Sampey , retiring president , said : " An intelligent and convinced Baptist , with the New Testament in his hand , finds little to draw him toward a church which denies the competence of the individual soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sole mediator . We can not get the consent of our minds to surrender the freedom with which Jesus Christ has set us free , in order to unite with Catholics or even evangelical pedobaptists those practicing infant baptism .
