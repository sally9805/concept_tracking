EDUCATION <P> In the Gothic shadow cast across Philadelphia by the ancient and excellent University of Pennsylvania , Temple University has spent ten years clamoring for public recognition . Cheap ( tuition : $200 ) and teeming ( enrollment : 10,106 ) , Temple is comparable to City College of New York . <P> Temple began as a theological class in the study of the Rev. Russell Herman Conwell . Later it was a workers ' night school in the basement of Dr. Conwell 's Grace Baptist Church . Finally it began expanding all over Philadelphia . Fiercely democratic , it kept its fees low , welcomed students regardless of their preparation or occupation . Among the creations of Founder Conwell , Temple never attained the fame of the inspirational lecture " Acres of Diamonds " which Dr. Conwell delivered more than 6,000 times before his death in 1925 . <P> Putting Temple on the educational map has been the work of Dr. Conwell 's successor , tall , bronzed Charles Ezra Beury ( pronounced " Beery " ) . Like his neighbor . Dr. Thomas Sovereign Gates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banker before he became a college president . A son of the rich , coal-operating Beurys for whom Beury , W. Va. , is named , Charles Ezra Beury graduated from Princeton in 1903 . When he received a law degree from Harvard three years later it was in absentia because that day he was marrying the Lutheran pastor 's daughter in his native Shamokin , Pa . His stock joke : " I became a bachelor and a benedict on the same day . " <P> A career as lawyer and banker brought him to Temple 's board of trustees where Dr. Conwell spotted him as a likely successor . After his election Dr. Beury tried for a while to be both president of Temple University and board chairman of Bank of Philadelphia &; Trust Co . In 1930 the bank was merged with Bankers Trust Co. of Philadelphia and Dr. Beury stepped out of the chairmanship . Few months later , Bankers Trust went down with a resounding crash . <P> With Temple , President Beury had done better . Raising $6,000,000 , he built a twelve-story classroom building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school of medicine . He acquired a school of chiropody . In 1932 he signed up Glen Scobey ( " Pop " ) Warner to coach football in a new stadium whose 40,000 seats have since been faithfully filled . <P> Temple 's benefactors have included Publisher Cyrus H. K. Curtis , his son-in-law Edward Bok , and Mr. &; Mrs. George F. Tyler , who gave the $1,000,000 School of Fine Arts now headed by Sculptor Boris Blai . In 1929 Thomas D. Sullivan , president of Philadelphia 's Terminal Warehouse Co. and brother of Pundit Mark Sullivan , left $278,000 towards a library . In 1934 , with private benefactions dried up , President Beury turned to the PWA for $550,000 to complete the building .
