txt " I should be very much obliged if you would let me have a resume of the Australian exchange situation . " I am afraid that I have not kept as closely in touch with Australian affairs as I should have done . I am familiar with the Government 's tariff policy , repudiation conversations , etc. , but I do not understand whether the inflation of about 30% is natural or artificial . It does not appear to have been induced by printing a disproportionate number of notes on a limited gold reserve . Have not gold convertibility restrictions been infringed ? " There is little that is mysterious in the elements of Australia 's situation so far as the exchange market is concerned . There is a working analogy between the exchange market and a bank clearing house . Each day every bank sends to the clearing house its drafts on the other banks and receives at the clearing house the drafts on itself presented by the other banks . The difference between the totals of " receivables " and " payables " is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cash . Similarly , in the escr4m- , : re markets of the world each country has " receivables " to collect representing its exports of commodities ( and services ) , its interest and dividends receivable , etc. , sales of securities and its borrowings in other countries ; it has " payables " to meet representing its imports of commodities ( and services ) , its interest and dividends payable , its purchases of securities and its loans to other countries . The difference between the totals of these receivables and payables is met by payments in gold  --  i.e. , gold exports . Per Capita Debt Close to $900 Australia 's present trouble is , simply , that as a. result of the commerce of her citizens in the past two years there has accumulated a large total of " payables " which she can not conveniently liquidate in gold . Consequently there is a large unsatisfied demand for payment from those to whom her citizens are indebted and some of those creditors are so desirous of payment that they are willing to discount their " receivables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash payment . Hence the " discount 's on Australia 's " pound " in the exchange market . This state of things has come about partly by reason of a recent sharp decline in the world price for Australia 's principal commodities of export  --  wheat and wool constitute about 60% of her normal exports  --  but mainly by reason of other and more permanent factors operating in the same direction . The states comprising the Commonwealth of Australia and the Commonwealth itself have , in a word , borrowed themselves to a standstill . About 6,000,000 inhabitants of the Australian . Continent ( including Tasmania ) owe in public debt . internal and external , well over $5,000,000,000 ; the indebtedness per capita , in fact , is at this moment probably close to $900 It is true that a considerable proportion of this debt represents governmental undertakings which , in theory at least , should be self-supporting , as for instance railways , but are in fact not productive of revenue . The railways , of which there are about 26,000 mites , governmentally owned and operated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 000,000 , exclusive of interest on capital . These railways represent an investment of more than $1.500,000,000 ? an over-capitalization , in the opinion of the Commonwealth Transport Committee-and several gauges are in use , each state having its own gauge and some twol The accumulated net deficit of state railways after payment of interest now stands at about $173 , - 000,000 . In addition to railways the states have gone extensively into various enterprises such as irrigation . Now Must Pay the Piper A year ago the report of the British Economic Mission , which grew out of a request by the Commonwealth at the Imperial Conference of 1926 , had this to say about Governmental activities in Australia : " Generally , we are so much impressed with the financial and economic risks surrounding Government borrowing for purposes of development that we are moved to suggest that Governments should restrict the sphere of their activities in this direction and in that of business undertakings and should leave the field more widely open than in the past to private enterprise . . . . Progress indeed might be slower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be more sure and the risks of loss and failure , which entail not progress but regression , would be greatly diminished . . . . We realize that a curtailment of loan expenditure by the Australia governments must involve the inevitable concomitants of deflation . Deflation , nevertheless , remains a course of wisdom , if it be true , as we think it is , that free expenditure on schemes very doubtfully remunerative'has contributed to produce an inflated position . The temporary apparent prosperity which such a position creates can not in any case be lasting . If it is sought to prolong it , it brings its own nemesis . " United States Consular reports ( according to National City Bank circular for February , 1931 ) indicate that about one-half the wage-earners in Australia are employes of the states and Commonwealth . The British Economic Mission points out that the combined operation of the tariff and the Arbitration acts -- the latter govern wage-scales and labor conditions " has raised costs " ( of production ) " to a level which has laid an excessive and possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell in the world 's markets can not pass on the burden to other sections of the Australian community . " The result has been to widen the gap between costs in Australia and costs in the outside world , and what the Economic Mission calls a *vicious circle of ever-ascending costs and prices " is crippling Australia 's progress and her power of supporting increased population . " In plain English , Australia has been living beyond her means , relying upon borrowing to fill the gap and the day of reckoning is here . And that is really all there is in her situation . Those who , viewing the failings of private business , are disposed to fall back upon " social control " would do well to study carefully the position of the states and Commonwealth at the present time . for Australia has gone a long way in experimenting with " social control . " Whatever may have been the advantage of this in spheres other than the material sphere it can not be credited with much success in the latter , so far , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
