SUGAR BE SWEET ! A STORY BY GEORGE MILBUtN S PRING was a soft green cloud hovering over the willow tree in the corner of Whalen 's front yard the day that Marion died . Mrs. Whalen wheeled her out on the front porch in her invalid 's chair after the noon meal so that she could take in the sunlight . She had been in high spirits all morning , excited about spring 's coming back . She talked cheerfully and she even suggested to her mother that she might be getting up soon . She wanted to go into the woods to pick violets . It was the first fine day of the season . And yet , beneath the warmth of the breeze , there was a reminiscent chill . Mrs. Whalen was careful to tuck the blankets snugly about her daughter . There were still to be rain and bitter days , it is true , but the motes of renascence were in the air . All about there was a quickening stir , and it was inconsistent that a body should die at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . Charlie Whalen was the one who heard the last words his daughter ever spoke . He reenacted the scene many times , in his own mind and for other people , with as many tears and hiccups as a sober strong man is permitted , all up until the funeral . But after the funeral he never thought of his distinction again , or if he did , he never said anything to anyone about it . The way it was , he recollected , he had finished his noon meal , a hearty dinner , and had got up and gone out into the hall to get his bat . He was about to leave the house when he felt in his vest pocket and found that he did n't have any toothpicks . So he went back into the dining room to get a few . The ruby glass toothpick-holder stood on the sideboard empty . Now where emptiness was there Charlie Whalen found a pinch of chaos . Later he was glad that he had not made a scene on finding the toothpicks all out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in itself . lie would never have got through blaming himself , he thought , if he had raised a commotion in that last hour of his daughter 's life . So he was pleased to recall that there had been more of reproach than of irritation in his voice when he spoke to his wife that noon . " Clara , " he said loudly , " what have you done with all the toothpicks ? " Mrs. Whalen was at that moment tucking the blankets about Marion against the faint chill of the April wind . She gave the covering a hurried final pat and hastened back into the house . " Just a minute , papa , and 11.1 get some toothpicks for you , " she said in her mild , faded voice . And she apologized as she disappeared into the kitchen , " I should have filled the glass this morning but I did n't notice that it was getting low . " She took the box of toothpicks down from the kitchen cabinet and put a handful of them into the little ruby glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greetings from the St. Louis World 's Fair , 1904 , Charles II . Whalen , " etched in ornate script around the red barrel . She hurried back into the dining room and placed the refilled holder on the sideboard . " There 's the toothpicks , papa , " she said , turning back to the kitchen . Charlie Whalen came into the dining room . " Where are they at ? " he said , still surly . " Right there on the sideboard , Charlie , " Mrs. Whalen said patiently . The sight of the fresh , complete little bundle placated him . He took out a dozen , rolling the smooth white slivers between his thumb and forefinger , enjoying the feel . He put one in the corner of his mouth and stuck the others in a vest pocket . " You want to watch that toothpick holder , Clara , " he said , not unkindly , going out . He appeared through his front door , making little chirps between his teeth while he prodded them , smoothing down his vest with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the porch . Mrs. Whalen , chastened , stayed in the kitchen . That was how it came about that the father was the only one to hear the girl 's last words . The Buick sedan stood in the driveway , its nickeled radiator throwing off little lances of sunlight . Charlie Whalen glanced at his only child . She lay back in the wheel chair , so fair , so bloodless , and beautiful . There were shadowy blue veins in her neck and a faint lacework of them at her temples where the breeze lifted a wisp of her golden hair . Against her face 's cool , transparent whiteness laythe soft crimson braces of her lips . Her eyes were closed , as she lay there in the sunlight , and Charlie thought she was asleep . He stood on the porch steps and tossed his frayed toothpick into the sear honeysuckle vines along the balustrade . He took out a cigar and cut the end with his small knife . A belch rose from his well-stuffed stomach and he suppressed it , causing the elk-tooth fob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigar and started down the walk . " Are n't you going to take the Buick , papa ? " Marion called , fluttering her eyelids . She had a dainty voice . Charlie Whalen halted and half turned . " Oh , I thought you was asleep , " he said in embarrassment . Marion said , " No , I 've been awake all the time . But are you walking to town ? Are n't you going to take the car ? " " No , I guess I wo n't take the car this afternoon , " Charlie Whalen said . " I kind of thought I would walk to town this afternoon . It 's too pretty a day not to walk . A day like this makes you feel like walking . " " Is n't it a perfectly gorgeous day , though , papa ! " Marion said , lilting . " Yes , it 's a fine day , all right . I guess spring is here , sure enough . I mean I do n't think we 'll have much more winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person want to get out in the open . " " Oh , does n't it , though , " Marion said ecstatically . " It just makes one feel closer to God ! " Two hours later Charlie Whalen found significance and solace in these words , which he chose to remember as the last his daughter ever uttered . At the moment , however , he was abashed by her demonstrative sentiment . It made him feel ludicrous to hear people say things like that . He was miserable with an eagerness to get away . He said , in brief agreement , " Yes , it 's mighty fine weather to-day , " and turned abruptly to go on down the walk . Then Marion called tenderly , " Good-by , daddy ! " and those were her last words . Those were really the portentous words . " Good-by , " Charlie called brightly , waving his arm . Charlie Whalen , the hearty , the well-filled , the munificent , dealer in automobiles , a car for every pocketbook , walked to town in the sunlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two , inhaling jerkily , taking an extra sniff each time to insure capacity and exhaling with a suddenness that left him slightly disconcerted . He tried to time his breathing to his footsteps , but the effort wearied him . Before he had gone far he felt that he had had enough of it for one day . He realized though that it was time he was beginning to think about getting back into condition . Every spring his thoughts turned to the danger of his growing flabby . " No use talking , " he murmured to himself . " I 've got to take off some of this belly . Must begin to get out and take more exercise . " But he contented himself with bringing his rubber heels sharply down on the concrete sidewalk , feeling a satisfying resilience . He was a large man , large in body , large in spirit too , any person in town would tell you . Charlie Whalen was no man 's debtor . He paid as he went and he was as substantial as he looked . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a magnificent cataract of flesh , was there to buttress the breadth of his shoulders . His hair was beginning to gray , but it was the iron-filings gray of stalwart middle-age and not the yellowed gray of infirmity . Charlie was proud of it , but the prospect of baldness gave himanxiety . He doused and massaged and trained tendrils of side hair against the shining pink encroachments of his forehead . He was beginning to study about age more often lately . That was why the promise of spring plagued him a bit . But it reassured him just as much . He felt his inner juices expanding in the mellow warmth of the early spring sunshine and he was ebullient with a great affection for all the redundant world . The forty-eight years of his life dwindled to short yesterdays . He felt very youthful . Two thin squirrels were racing in the Presbyterian churchyard . Charlie paused to watch them until they scrabbled up a big oak , still leafless , and disappeared down a sprawling crotch . He smiled on them benignly and winked to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fleeting meditation of lustful joys . Charlie Whalen walked on . The fusty smell of turned earth came to him , cool as a cave , and all along his passage he called cheerful howdies to towel-turbaned housewives digging in flowerbeds , beating rugs , and sweeping off front porches . They replied to his genial bellows with smiles and pleasant comments on the weather and the new season . He strode on toward town and an afternoon 's confinement in his automobile sales and service office with every assurance that the world was a fine place to he living in . He continued to exchange brief comments on the weather with everyone he met : " Scrumptious weather we 're having , eh , Ed ? " for " Yes , sir-ee , Charlie , fine day . " Once or twice , to be sure , there were faint disturbances in his stomach , weighted with its heavy noon meal . He drew in his chin with little jerks to suppress the gases that rose in his throat and he threw away his cigar . When he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , he stopped short in his tracks and regarded that thoroughfare with amazement . Broadway was a fluttering mass of color . Hitched to the castiron electric-light standards , segments in the White Way , that symbol of the progressive community , were ropes stretched from side to side bearing a carnival array of colored pennants . Many store windows along the street were decorated with bright paper crescents . The vision puzzled Charlie . Broadway , when he had left his office for dinner a short while before twelve o'clock , had been neat and drab and almost without activity of any kind . There seemed at first no logical way in which this sudden transformation could be explained . He looked at the gay pennants more closely and saw that each of them was lettered . " Lucky Moon Auction Sales , " Charlie muttered . " What in the name of goodness have the boys got up now ? " He walked on a few doors up the street to where Virgil Clay ( You-furnish-the-girl - and - let - Clay - furnish - the-home ) stood leaning against a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's all this , Virge ? " said Charlie . " How come all the decorations ? " He noticed that the furniture store windows also were plastered with the crescent posters . Virgil Clay 's smooth round face wimpled and broke . " Why , ai n't you heard , Charlie ? " he said . " It 's a trade stimulator scheme that they 've got pret ' near ever ' leading merchant in town signed up on . I allowed you 'd be the first one to get in on it . " Charlie frowned . " Well , now that you mention it , it does seem to me like there was a man come in to my place last week talking about it . But these birds have always got something going , and I did n't pay much attention to him . You can just figure that the main thing they 're interested in is making some money out of you , instead of having any idea that would help you make money . A thing like this , " Charlie gestured heavily toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my business . " " Whoa now , Charlie , whoa now , " Virgil exclaimed . " You do n't even know how this Lucky Moon proposition works . We got to have something like this to stir things up ever ' once in a while . The farmers like it , and it does draw trade . That 's an absolute proved fact . And this here Lucky Moon proposition is a new wrinkle that beats anything of the kind I ever heard of . Better than one of them automobile drawings anyhow . " He chuckled and nudged Charlie . " Oh , now , I do n't know , Virge , " Charlie Whalen said with only the flicker of a grin . " Last fall when the merchants had that big trades-day drawing and give away that Chivy touring from my place , this street was just packed solid . You know that . And I bet that 's the biggest Saturday crowd this town ever did have . I let the Chamber of Commerce have that Chivy at cost . From all I ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , but you know how it is , Charlie . Having one big prize like that only one person can draw it . The country people all gets suspicious , and then somebody living right here in town generally always gets the prize  --  you know , somebody that do n't need it at all  --  and then all the farmers claims that it 's just a frame-up . You ca n't argue them out of it , neither . I never seen an automobile drawing like that yet that it did n't cause a lot of hard talk and ill feeling among the country people . " " So you figure that this Lucky Moon Auction Sale proposition is a better one than a trades-day automobile drawing , do you , Virge ? " " Yes , sir , Charlie , I do . I was sold on it right off . The way it 's worked out , I look to see it cause a right smart pick-up in business around here . And , Lord knows , this town certainly needs it . Just here last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Well , how 's business , Mr. Clay ? ' And I looks at him and says , ' Weil , sir , the best I can remember , the last business I had was pretty darn ' good . ' " He laughed at his own witticism , his face as ruddy as a tomato . " Yes , but tell me one thing , Virge . How does this proposition work ? You speak so high of it , I might of made a mistake not to get in on it . " " You sure did make a mistake , Charlie . It 's only offered to one line of business in a town , and I see they already got the Ford Garage signed up on it . We 're going to have circulars out some time to-day , giving all the details , but it do n't take but a minute to tell how the plan works . " " Well , let 's hear then . The fellow that come in to sell me last week tried to high-pressure me , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virge . Not on Charlie Whalen . So 1 did n't pay much attention to his line . Just told him that I could n't be interested and sent him on his way . Then the first thing I know the whole street blooms out with these colored flags . They did n't have none of them up before 1 went to dinner . " " No , none of them was up before noon . They put them all up during the noon hour , " Virgil Clay explained . " They come in by express on the 10:45 . But the way this Lucky Moon Auction Sale works : fourteen of us is signed up on it , Epstein 's Clothing Store , and the O.K. Butcher Shop , and Ira Cunliff 's grocery , and the Luxor Barber Shop , and , now let 's see . Luxor , O.K. Butcher Shop , Epstein 's . And Milady 's Style Shop-pe and the Record-Deniocrat . And my place . How many is that ? Anyway , there 's fourteen of us signed up on it . I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole list will he on these circulars we 're getting out to-day . " Now , the idea is ever ' time a customer makes a cash purchase , we give him a coupon with the amount he spent on it . Coupons just issued for cash purchases , or for payment on account . Double coupons issued whenever merchant so desires . Then we have a bunch of premiums put up on display somewheres , a big variety of premiums , just like prizes . Each merchant furnishes a premium for each and every auction sale . All kinds of things from radio sets to groceries . Sensible things that people would have to spend real money for . No gimcracks . " Now then , ever ' two weeks we have an auction sale , and these coupons we put out count just like real money at these auctions . The customer , of course , is supposed to take and save up these coupons until he gets enough on hand to do some bidding . He uses his coupons to bid on any of the articles he wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coupons was cash money , see ? " So you see , ever'body has a chance at something . It works a whole lot better than a drawing , because it 's all out in the open . Anybody can see that there ai n't no monkey business to it . All premiums are on display ahead of time . And all that it costs the merchant is for the coupons , which we have to buy from this concern that got up the idea . And we all have to chip in with some article from our place of business worth at least five dollars in value  --  some little piece of merchandise that would make a good premium . In that way all premiums is purchased at wholesale , right here from home-town merchants , keeping home money at home . And lots of times a merchant might be able to work off a slow-moving piece of goods for a premium . This company that puts out the proposition loans us all these decorations free of charge . The only cost to us is the coupons . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , I see , I see ! " said Charlie , looking very grave . " And of course some of these farmers around here will take to killing off their families just so they can come in and pay you cash for coffins so as to get Lucky Moon Auction Sale coupons ! " Virgil Clay , unsmiling and serious , said , " Well , Charlie , I sure hope that nothing like that do n't happen . But I tell you the truth , I do believe that this is going to stir up a lot of interest after it gets good and started . And if anybody was to come in here and pay me cash for mortician 's work , or a coffin , or anything , I 'd issue them coupons , just like I would if they had bought a bedstead , or a rug , or a refrigerator . I sure would ! " Charlie chuckled . " That 's the spirit , Virge ! All I 've got to say is , I hope this proposition will stimulate business as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He pulled out his watch and glanced at it . " My God ! " he exclaimed , snapping the case sharply . " Here I stand gassing with yon , and it 's darn ' near two o'clock . I 'll be seeing you , Virge ! " " Sure thing , Charlie ! " The furniture man turned his gaze hack to the fluttering , bright-hued ' Lucky Moon Auction Sale pennants . Clara Whalen finished washing and drying the dishes from the noon meal . She tidied the kitchen methodically and then she went over the parlor with the vacuum sweeper . She hurried about her household routine , a noiseless , mousy woman who had not had an independent thought in twenty years . Her blue eyes had lost color and expression , her golden hair had turned ashen , and yearly she had grown more dun and shy . Sometimes it would occur to people to remark , as if they had suddenly made a startling discovery , " You know , anyone can tell by looking at Charlie Whalen 's wife that she must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There was a relationship between Clara Whalen and her daughter , however , that sometimes made Charlie Whalen feel as if he were an awkward stranger in his own house . He was undisputed master there , but Marion and her mother kept an understanding that transcended filial affection . They would sit for long hours in the same room , sewing perhaps , or , when the work was all done in the afternoon , gazing vacantly , silent and content to be with each other . A long period would pass without either of them speaking . Then , when one of them said something in a low , soft voice , almost cooing , neither would be surprised to find that the one who had spoken had added a word to what the other had been thinking . They seldom made any outward sign of their affection , no embraces , no tender kisses . They did not use terms of endearment : Marion was " Sister " and Clara Whalen was " Mamma . " But from the time Marion was a baby until she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , when Marion was near death that last winter of her life , Mrs. Whalen sat by her bedside wan and immobile until one had the uncanny feeling that as Marion sank life was ebbing away from Clara Whalen too . The doctor said that the mother 's constancy had probably brought Marion through the winter . So Mrs. Whalen , too , felt a buoyancy that spring day . Not even her hus-band 's displeasure could dispel it for long . She knew that she had been at fault in letting the toothpick holder get empty , and she had gone back to the kitchen in humiliation . But by the time she had finished straightening up the sitting room she caught herself humming a happy , if tuneless , song . She left off quickly , pursing her lips with chagrin . Then she took off her kitchen apron and came out on the front porch , tucking at her hair . She noticed that Marion 's eyes were open , so she said , " Does that sunlight feel good on you , Sister ? " Marion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and she saw the cold glaze on Marion 's beautiful eyes and she saw Marion 's sweet lips parted in the gape of death . So it was all very seemly when the neighbors came in answer to Clara Whalen 's cries . The incongruousness of a girl 's death on a day when all the earth was stirring with new life was not mentioned by them . " So sweet , " murmured the misty-eyed ones who refrained from sobbing loudly . - So sweet . So peaceful and all . Just like she had went to sleep . She did n't suffer at all , Mrs. Whalen , or else she would n't be laying back so sweet and gentle there . Such a beautiful way to die , Mrs. Whalen . " They buried Marion on a Saturday . The church was crowded . She had a fine funeral , and no one was disappointed . Charlie Whalen was never a man to stint on anything . Two Saturdays later Charlie Whalen stood in his automobile showroom , gazing out through the plate-glass window at the preparations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vacant lot opposite . Already the farmers and their families had started gathering . They stood about , staring hungrily at theproceedings . Many of them held wads of coupons in their hands and they would re-count their hoards from time to time , thumbing the colored paper slips and peering with covetous side glances at the savings held by their neighbors . At 2:30 a truck drove up , hauling the premiums that had been on display for two weeks in the south show window of Epstein 's Model Clothing Store . That was a large array of desirable merchandise . None of your cheap , shoddy premiums , but articles contributed by local merchants sponsoring the plan usable , substantial articles all , things for which one ordinarily would have to pay real money . Ladies ' rayon hose from Milady 's Style Shoppe , a red-lacquered end table from Clay 's Furniture Store , a boy 's roller coaster from the Green Front Hardware Company , a set of inner tubes from the Ford Garage , a hundred-pound sack of sugar from Ira Cunliff 's grocery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen other items equally indispensable , including some intangible ones represented by show-cards such as five dollars ' worth of printing at the Record-Democrat 's job shop and twenty shaves at the Luxor Barber Shop . Ready hands began unloading the premiums from the truck . It was about time . Charlie Whalen strolled across the street and joined the throng . A loose plank platform had been erected in the center of the lot . The goods were stacked on it . Major Cummings , the town auctioneer , had been retained for the occasion . It took the jocose major to make an auction sale a gala event . He was already warming up , prancing up and down the rickety platform , his broad black Stetson pushed back on his head , his black windsor tie flapping when a stray breeze caught it . " Ah , yes ! Ah , yes ! " he bellowed as he paced the unsteady , rattling planks . " Draw right on up close , folks . Come right on up near so as you wo n't miss no bargains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bang pretty quick now . Do n't be bashful , neighbors . They 's plenty of room down in front here . " He caressed his broad belly complacently . Two hundred successful farm auctions had convinced Major Cummings that he was a master of men . He coaxed the gaping farmers and their timid wives in a loud , generous voice , but when some of the small boys down in front got pressed against the platform and began scuffling and jostling , he put by his sugary tone to say to them in a low , mean aside , " Watch out there ! Stand back away from that there sawhorse ! You 'll have the whole blamed works down on the ground the first thing you know . " Then , looking out over the adult throng again , he resumed his louder , wheedling , mellifluous tone . The corner lot was a squirming block of people . Farmers and their wives had come from miles around . They were still skeptical about whether the Lucky Moon coupons were worth anything , but they clutched their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some shady dealing . Major Cummings started the auction by holding up a box of rayon hose , " Hey , look'ye , look'ye ! Five pair of gen-u-wine rayon silk hose in five diff'runt shades . Now what am I bid ? These here stockings will give any women 's limbs that come-hither look . Gals , when you stick your Limbs into a pair of these here hose , you wo n't have to worry no more about how your face looks . " This risque quip caused an outburst of raucous , embarrassed laughter , and a hundred elbows moved in nudges . The Major went on , " What do I hear for this ass-sort-ment of gen-u-winerayon silk hose ? Five pair , five , and no two shades alike . Who 'll say twenty ? Twenty-twenty-twenty ! And the young feller with the front teeth in his mouth over there says uh ten ! I betcha he 's got his eye on the gal he 's going to give ' em to already . " Rowdy laughter greeted this remark , but the Major paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucky Moon coupons counts just like U. S. A. cash money at this sale . Only you could n't use cash money here if you was wanting to . Everything here goes for the Lucky Moon coupons and the Lucky Moon coupons only . They come to you free ; now let 's let ' em go free . You did n't have to strike a lick of work to get ' em . Come to you just like they had been willed to you . So let 's hear a good bid now ! I 'm bid ten . Let me hear uh twenty ! Twenty-twenty-twenty ! And uh twenty from the young lady over there with the black hat on . Who 'll bid me thirty ? Do I hear uh thirty ? " So the sale progressed . As soon as the rayon hose had been knocked down to a young farm hand for thirty-two-fifty , the Major , giving out exaggerated grunts , hoisted aloft a cured ham . " Now , ladies and them that run after you , here is something that you can sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up in the old smoke house and put it by for winter . A few slabs of this would go mighty good to lay up against your ribs on a frosty mornin ' . All smoked and preserved and she 'll tip the beam at twenty pounds easy . So do n't let me hear any of them measly little bids on this here great big fine cured ham ! Let me hear uh hundurd . Uh hundurd ! Am I bid uh hundurd ? " As the people grew accustomed to the large denominations of their imitation money , which had been issued generously in a hundred side-deals and which had been carefully collected from less provident neighbors , the bidding grew high and reckless . The farm auction was always an event with its social as well as its business aspects , and the Lucky Moon Sale resembled a farm auction closely enough to be an enjoyable occasion . Farmers and townspeople alike took vast pleasure in dealing with the large , imaginary sums printed on their coupons . That evening at the supper table Mrs. Whalen said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a hundred-pound sack of sugar on the truck a little while before you came . I 'm glad you thought to get it , because we were almost out of sugar . To-morrow is Sunday , and I would have had to run over to Mrs. Fitz to borrow a cupful , or we would n't have had a grain of sugar in the house . " " Well , that hundurd-pound sack ought to last us a while , " Charlie said , helping himself to the gravy . " Yes , it 'll soon be canning season , and it wo n't be a bit too much . " " I sort of figured we could use it , " Charlie said . " Did you get it at a bargain ? " " Did I get it at a bargain ? I 'll say I got it at a bargain , " he said proudly . " And I would of got it at a whole lot better bargain if a bull-headed German farmer from out here east of town had n't been bidding against me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got it at that Lucky Moon Auction Sale they 're putting on . " " Oh , Mrs. Fitz was over here yesterday asking me whether I was saving those Lucky Moon coupons . But I did n't get it straight in my head how the auction part worked . " " Well , it 's just like a drawing , only they issue you these coupons , and you use them to bid just like money . They 're supposed to issue them , a dollar coupon for a dollar spent , butsome of the merchants in on the deal have been issuing double coupons . Before long they 'll be issuing triple coupons ; I would n't be surprised . I would of got that sack of sugar for half of what I did , because I had ever ' one else bluffed right on the start . But this farmer ( it was old August Schaeffer from out here east , that 's who it was ) , he kept running the bid up on me . Somebody told me that he had bought him an incubator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued him double coupons on the deal . He had a bunch of coupons there big enough to choke a yearling heifer . I had to bid eight hundred dollars , all the coupons I had , before I could get him stopped . " " Eight hundred dollars ' worth ? My goodness ! Where did we get eight hundred dollars ' worth of coupons ? " " Where do you suppose ? " Charlie said , sharply , his head turned down toward his plate . He readied out for the sugar bowl to sweeten his coffee . His spoon grated against the bowl 's crusted inside . " Charlie , you do n't mean from ? " He flung down his spoon and interrupted her loudly , " Clara , you 've let the sugar bowl get empty again ! " She sat very still , staring at him . He addressed her with pursed lips , in mincing , mock-politeness , " Madam , would you be so kind as to get up and fill that sugar bowl like you ought to of done before supper ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move . Charlie Whalen pushed back his chair angrily . " All right ! " he shouted , his face gorged with blood . " All right , then ! " he shouted , making for the kitchen with the empty sugar bowl in his hand . " If you 're going to be a goddamn ' fool about this , I 'll go fill the sugar bowl myself . " Clara Whalen sat very still , her eyes hard with loathing .
