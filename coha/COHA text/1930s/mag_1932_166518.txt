STATES &; CITIES <P> Mr. Mayor , would you be good enough to take the stand ? <P> Responding to this long-awaited invitation in the New York County Court House last week , the slick incumbent of " the third biggest job in the U. S. " glanced alertly about him to orient friend &; foe , shot his broad , lopsided campaign smile , sat down jauntily to defend himself against gravest suspicions of his official conduct . As he looked around him in the packed , hot chamber , Mayor James John ( " Jimmy " ) Walker could see friends aplenty : Lawyer Dudley Field Malone , Police Commissioner Edward P. Mulrooney 's wife , a host of rowdy Tammanyites and the hard-headed Democratic minority of the Legislative investigation committee which was about to wave at him . His friends proved a loyal group , wildly cheering his cheapest sallies , hissing &; booing his inquisitor . Outside was an admiring multitude who really would not care if it were proved that " Jimmy " had stolen the Brooklyn Bridge . <P> Mayor Walker did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Leaning casually against the rail of the Press box was the committee 's counsel , grey-haired Samuel Seabury , pontifical , bland , courteous , smiling , maddening . For this moment Inquisitor Seabury had patiently labored for 14 months , relentlessly cutting his way through the city 's political jungle , confident that he would come at last to its heart-the Mayor 's office in City Hall . At stake were not only His Honor 's honor , but His Honor 's job and perhaps his liberty as well . <P> Inquisitor Seabury , following up testimony he had previously wrung from the Mayor 's associates , conducted his inquiry along four major channels : <P> Buses . Why did the Mayor in 1926-27 sponsor a franchise for Equitable Coach Co. , later declared " a financial paralytic " by the State Transit Commission in ordering the franchise inoperative , when a company competing for the franchise had promised to operate more buses at a lower fare and posted a substantial guarantee ? Why did the Mayor buy securities in Interstate Trust Co. , later used in an abortive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one J. Allan Smith , Eqidtable 's New York agent , bought Mayor Walker a $10,000 letter of credit ( later extended by $3,000 ) when the Mayor went abroad in 1927 , having just signed the franchise ? <P> His Honor evaded any direct answer to the first question , jocularly wisecracking that the best offer the city ever had for a bus line came from a Long Island hay &; feed firm ( Laughter ) . <P> To the second question the Mayor said : " I never owned a share , I never sold one , I never profited one penny off any share of that stock , I never saw a copy , or even a photostatic copy , before in all my life of any share in that company . ... I never knew who owned it . " Mr. Seabury knew that in Wall Street one of the chief selling points urged by vendors of Interstate and <P> Equitable securities was that blocks of them had been " put aside for the City Hall boys . " After the Mayor left the stand , Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares of Interstate stock on the Mayor 's behalf . <P> Inquisitor-Did the Mayor pay for his stock , the 300 shares ? <P> Park Commissioner-The money came to me from City Hall , Judge .
