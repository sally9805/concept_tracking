txt For several weeks it has been quite obvious that Uncle Sam would have to step into the oil business under some " partnership in planning ' arrangement . Now , with a control bill in Congress , it seems as though it might be only a matter of days before this takes place . ttepresentative raariane , of C-71.21.1.10///11. , time head of Marland Oil Co. ( now known as Continental Oil Co. ) introduced the measure . Press reports from ' Washington quoted Mr. Marland as saying no dictator was provided for in the proposed law . Dictator or no dictator , the Secretary of the Interior would be given authority to fix minimum and maximum prices , to determine how much oil the market requires , to license imports , to allocate to the various states their share of production and to do various other unprecedented things . He would even be able to administer proration within any particular state if local authorities did n't take care of it themselves . In addition to that , he would have the power to set minimum wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be better to say that the bill would make the Secretary a " c --  " of the oil trade . Even a word as strot ? - as that wo n't sound bad to some investors in a field that has been characterized by nothing less than economic anarchy . In few other fields has competition held more complete and destructive sway . The petroleum industry itself has n't been able to do anything about it on account of anti-trust laws . State governments have n't been able to handle it effectively because of political conditions , legal entanglements and the simple fact that oil fields exist in too many different parts of the country . There has been incessant wrangling about how production should be divided and how big the market deli/and really is . Storm center of the industry has been the northern corner of East Texas where the world 's greatest oil pool , now tapped by nearly ten thousand wells , was discovered just at a time when a need for cutting output rather than increasing it was more important than ever . Largely as a result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States is now running at the highest levels in history , and , as the International Economic Research Bureau recently pointed out , oil is the one basic world commodity that is now selling at lower prices than a month ago . What Is the " Transfer Problem " I When Oscar Brown of Des Moines owes his neighbor John Smith $1,000 he can take that much United States currency across the street with him and pay the debt . When Frank Jones of San Francisco owes Smith $1,000 he can draw a check on , say , the Bank of America , send it to his creditor and the obligation is discharged . But when Manual Gonzales , somewhere in South America , or Wilhelm Mueller , somewhere in Germany , owes the equivalent of $1,000 to Mr. Smith of Des Moines , then a more or less misunderstood factor called " the transfer problem " is likely to enter the situation . What about this " transfer problem " anyway ? It is simply due to the fact that the Smiths and the Gonzaleses and the Muellers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . Smith , to consider himself really " paid , " wants dollars that he can spend in Des Moines . But Senor Gonzales probably has pesos of some kind or other and Herr Mueller has marks . So paying Smith not only requires that his foreign creditors have the necessary funds in their own countries but that they are also able to exchange them for Smith 's kind of money ? dollars . This business of exchanging one kind of money for another is responsible , in these days when the international gpld standard is out of commission , for the " transfer problem . " Gonzales may be the richest man in his community and Mueller may have a credit rating in the Fatherland that is A-1 , but unless they can buy dollars they ca n't pay Smith . How can they buy dollars ? Only by finding someone who is willing to sell dollars and take pesos or marks , as the case may be , in exchange . And who wants pesos or marks ? Ordinarily only someone who wants to buy something or pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Talk It Over So this so-called transfer problem is closely tied up with the flow of funds from one nation to another as the result of international buying and selling and international debt payments in I both directions . If the movement in one direction tends to overbalance the movement in the other , there have to be shipments of gold or ? if gold is not available  --  there have to be such things as defaults , moratoriums , exchange control and " standstill agreements . " Creditors of Germany are going to meet in Berlin in a few days to consider this very problem Germany has little gold and can not afford to let go of any . Germany owes much more money to the rest of the world than the rest of the world owes Germany . The supply of foreign money that German debtors , public and private , can get to pay interest and principal to their creditors abroad is just about limited to ' the value of Germany 's excess of exports over imports . This supply  --  this quantity of dollars . francs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't using to buy goods and services i abroad -- has to be divided up among the creditors whoarc clamoring for It is n't a question of how many marks the Germans have in their safes or in their banks . It is a question of how many of those marks can be traded for currency and bank balances that the lenders to Germany are willing to accept , and how such available means of payment are to tie distributed . ? Engineer-Educator Herds Shoals Board Dr. Arthur Morgan , president of Antioch College . will head the powerful Tennessee Valley Authority that has just been created by the Muscle Shoals Act By some this may be interpreted as one more step toward government by college professors and index numbers , but Dr Morgan v ? as a civil engineer before he became an educator and is credited with having planned and supervised some 75 water control projects in a number of states Utility managers all over the country will watch developments at Muscle Shoals with considerable interest but none more intently than Wendel L.

His latest statement , however , seems to indicate that the effect of the new measure depends largely on whether the Tennessee Valley Authority decides to build its own transmission lines or whether it does n't . It is free to do as it pleases about the matter . Advocates of " government operation " and bigger and better " yardsticks " to measure pri vate utility rate structures are figuratively throwing their hats in the air because one of their fondest dreams has apparently come true . Interests on the other side of the fence are wondering just how much of the " cheapness " of Tennessee Valley power is going to be due to making electricity a byproduct , as it were , of national defense , flood control and other things that are included in the new project .                 @ @ @ @
