txt Both houses of the Legislature passed unanimously today three bills paving the way for a $30,000,000 bond issue for unemployment relief and continuing machinery for relief purposes . The action is designed to extend State aid through this year and next , should the depression last all of that period . The bond issue , initiated in one bill , is contingent upon a referendum . The question will be submitted to the voters in the Fall . The second measure extends the life of the temporary emergency relief administration , of which Jesse I. Straus is the head , beyond the next election . The third bill provides for an appropriation of $5,000,000 from the general fund to carry the relief ad- , ministration through the months1 which must elapse before bonds for the purpose of unemployment relief can be issued . This measure , which was sponsored by Senator Wicks of Ulster , also makes provision for Shifting from work relief to home relief of $575,000 of the funds , appropriated last year . Red Tape Cut for Action . The action on the relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assembly of a message from Governor Roosevelt in which he submitted his alternative plans for a bond issue for highway purposes or an issue of bonds that would go before the voters for approval at the election in November , tagged as unemployment relief bonds . The first proposal was an expedient to " save the face " of the State , since its recognized policy is not to issue bonds except for more or less permanent improvements . Both Republicans and Democrats jumped at the opportunity of voting for the relief bills , which were passed under emergency messages to cut red tape that would have required the measures to remain on the desks of Senators and Assemblymen for th , ree legislative days before being taken up for final action . The leaders of both parties In the Legislature were immensely relieved through the acquiescence of Governor Roosevelt in a proposal which has saved the Republican Legislature from the necessity of imposing a new tax to raise funds for relief purposes . The Governor , too , undoubtedly shares in this feeling , although he feels somewhat put out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creation of bonded indebtedness for a transitory need , since the Republicans , as had been predicted , rejected his proposal to have the issue called highway bonds and decided to call them frankly relief bonds for the appeal that this tag would make to the voters . Governor 's Message . The Governor , in his message , said in part : " I believe that we were all of one mind at our conferences that in normal times the only proper way to provide fuds for this purpose would be by a ta.koof some kind . This form of expenditure clearly comes under the head of current expenses and should be borne from current funds . " We can not , however , blink the fact that the people of our State are already heavily burdened by taxation . The burden is now made even heavier by the present business depression , which , of course , reduces ability to pay . It is further expected . of course , that additional burdens of taxation will be laid by the Federal Government to make up the huge deficit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic thought of the country is unable to predict with any certainty any early return to normal conditions which would warrant the hope that by next year the condition of business would make more easy the levy of additional taxes needed for these purposes . " In such extraordinary times , I believe that extraordinary measures , otherwise not to be considered , are justified . " It has been suggested in our conferences that the sum of five million dollars be appropriated from current revenues without a new tax , so as to carry the work of the temporary emergency relief administration up to next election day , and that on election day a referendum . be submitted to the people for a bond issue to meet the balance of the requirements up to Jan. 1 , 1934 . I approve of that suggestion . Holds Crisis Justifies Step . " I am fully aware of the fact that this would be a departure from the pay-as-you-go policy ; I am also aware of the fact , however , that conditions which now face us , in their gravity akin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If the people approve this proposal , the necessary money for the coming Winter and part of the succeeding Winter would be made available from this issue and the burden of taking care of distress relief would thus be spread over a period of years . " While in theory issuing of highway bonds is preferable because it funds a public improvement which lasts many years , and the funding of unemployment relief does not do this , nevertheless from the practical rather than the theoretical standpoint either method brings a substantially equal amount of cash into the treasury and on this ground either may be justified . " It should be borne in mind that even if the proposition be approved on a referendum , the money need not all be appropriated next year unless the Legislature deems it necessary . Only so much as conditions then make necessary would then be spent . " I believe that the legislative and executive branches of the government are in strict accord on the soundness of the pay-as-you-go ? principle in State finance for anything other than permanent improvements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State , which is the strongest in the world , and we should- adhere to it under all ordinary conditions . The present crisis , however , can not be met except with great hardship in any way other than as above indicated , and I recommend it to your honorable bodies for approval . " -
