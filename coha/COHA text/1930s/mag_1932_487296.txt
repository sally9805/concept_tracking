SERIOUS RESERVATIONS must be made to many of the views expressed in President Hoover 's special message on war debts . He hints , for example , that we can not revise these debts without " definite compensations . " What are these compensations to be ? Shall they be lower tariffs abroad on American goods ? And will this be any contribution to world stability so long as our tariff remains at its present extravagant levels , and is even jacked up from time to time , as it was on December 16 by President Hoover 's own order raising rates on eight items ? Yet when all reservations are made , the essence of the President 's message on war debts is statesmanlike , and one can only regret that Mr. Hoover had not the courage to take such a stand before we had driven seven nations to default . The heart of the President 's new proposal is in this paragraph : A year ago I requested that Congress should authorize creation of a debt commission to deal with situations which were bound to arise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation as it has developed , it appears necessary for the Executive to proceed . Obviously , any conclusions would be subject to approval by the Congress . On the other hand , should the Congress prefer to authorize creation of a debt commission set up along the lines above indicated , it would meet my hearty approval . What President Hoover now says , in other words , is that he hopes for a revival by Congress of something like the World War Foreign Debt Commission , ' because the complex questions involved call for special knowledge and can not be adequately handled by ordinary diplomatic exchanges , but that if he does not get cooperation from Congress he will go ahead anyway . And his reason is the obvious one that we can not afford to wait until March 4 next to get such vital negotiations under way . Obviously , this program can not be successful without the immediate and whole-hearted cooperation , which Mr. Hoover invites , of the President-elect . Mr , Roosevelt 's duty is clear . No merely technical quibbles should any longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what will undoubtedly be one of the most important questions with which he will be called upon to deal in his whole term . O WEN D. YOUNG 'S TESTIMONY in the ' mull case will profoundly shock his friends and admirers . It will be recalled that in January , 1929 , Mr. Insull let Mr. Young in for a good thing by permitting him to have a fourthousand-share interest in Insull Utility Investments at an insider 's price of $12 a share , while the public was allowed to purchase at $30 or above ; it went to $149 . Mr. Young testified that he thoroughly approved of the capital set-up of this company , which was the one that brought the whole Insull structure crashing to earth . Mr. Young was the ideal stockholder . He testified on December 16 that he " paid no attention to the investment and did not even read the annual reports " of the company , not because " I deal carelessly with investments , but because it would have made no difference with this particular investment . I could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a profit or take a loss without incurring Mr. Insull 's displeasure . " He did not even dare to ask about the status of the company when Mr. Instill came to him and demanded , in December , 1930 , a $2,000,000 loan from the General Electric Company . He promptly got the money because , as Mr. Young put it , ' he was one of our best customers , " and despite the fact that all banks had refused him further loans . When Mr. Young was asked if he inquired what Mr. Insull was going to use the money for , he replied : " I , as Chairman of the Board of the General Electric Company , would not have asked Mr. Insull what he was going to do with the money . " So the General Electric went into the banking business and lent its stockholders ' $2,000 , - , 000 to an already bankrupt concern . Within two months Samuel Insull was back asking Mr. Young to help him stave off his bank creditors , which Mr. Young was able to do for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps the least damaging , of Mr. Young 's testimony , to which we shall refer at length in a later issue .
