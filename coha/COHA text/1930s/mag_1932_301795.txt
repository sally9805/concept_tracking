The Wet Parade ( Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ) is an honest and clever adaptation of Upton Sinclair 's sloppy tract on Prohibition ( TIME , Sept. 28 ) . Without the radicalism of its original , it delineates the evils of drink and shows , without partiality Wet or Dry , that guzzling to excess brings misery . The heroine ( Dorothy Jordan ) is the daughter of a charming but besotted Southern gentleman ( Lewis Stone ) . His suicide and the inherited alcoholism of her brother are enough to make her drink shy . She has an even better reason . In Manhattan , where she finds her brother drunk in a hotel , she meets a youth ( Robert Young ) , whose father , like her own , is inebriate . Because of Prohibition , the father ( Walter Huston ) drinks raw alcohol in large quantities . It drives him so wild that he beats his wife to death . Dorothy Jordan and Robert Young are drawn together by their mutual hate of alcohol . When they marry , Young joins the Federal Prohibition force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seasoned agent of the law ( Jimmy Durante ) . Gangsters try to kill him . He is saved by Durante at the lamentable expense of Durante 's own life . But this is only a minim of catastrophe . The heroine 's brother goes blind from poison booze . The hero 's father gets life imprisonment for murder . <P> The Wet Parade is thus a horrid but exciting reprobate 's progression , replete with all the disasters that can befall a drunkard as he lurches toward the grave . It is brilliantly acted by a fine cast , coherently constructed and , unlike D. W. Griffith 's miserable picture The Struggle , manufactured in the present tense . Good shot : a ' legger 's plant in full operation , showing the printing presses for fake labels , the process of dousing whiskey bottles in brine to make them look as though they had come off a boat . <P> <P> Hotel Continental ( Tiffany ) . Having stumbled upon unity-of-place in Vicki Baum 's Grand Hotel , cinema producers have been fascinated by it , presumably because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Continental varies the unity-of-place idea by nearly personifying it . This time the hotel is an old one about to be torn down and the denizens who scamper through its antique corridors are bent on the forlorn gaiety of a farewell party . Mingling with the other guests is a cosmopolitan thief ( Theodore Von Eltz ) who hopes to retrieve some money which he cached in a fireplace long before . He experiences some trouble getting it because there is a party in the suite where it is hidden and because his accomplice turns out to be a lady member of a rival gang of thieves . She betrays him but regrets it , in time to persuade him to risk a reformation . Produced by a small company with an inexpensive cast , cheap sets and a trick story , the film is fair entertainment and should be even fairer as an investment for its makers . Good shot : a fat person ( Bert Roach ) softly crying " Help ! " as he tries , with two straws , to extricate a cherry from a drink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
