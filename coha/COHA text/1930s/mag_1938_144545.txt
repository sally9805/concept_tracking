Oldest university in the Americas is not Harvard ( founded 1636 ) but the University of San Marcos , in Lima , Peru . San Marcos was established in 1551 . Today , housed in a 16th-Century Spanish colonial building , it is made up of a group of professional schools which train Peruvian Government officials . Last week University of San Marcos began to teach a language so ancient it was new even to old San Marcos . The tongue was Quechua , the dialect of the ancient Inca tribes . From it have come such English words as quinine , cocaine . Quechua is still the language of most of the Peruvian Indians . Although it has no literature , it is written down in a few hieroglyphics on prehistoric buildings , will be taught to scholars as a means of exploring the unknown history of ancient Peru .
