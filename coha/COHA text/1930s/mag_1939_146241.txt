There are some 17,000 Certified Public Accountants in the U. S. To win the coveted initials C.P.A. they had to pass rigorous examinations in accounting . Beyond that , their functions are virtually unregulated by law . Their methods of auditing and analyzing a corporation 's balance sheet are their own , the developments of over 400 years of practice . The U. S. public first realized that these methods were not always perfect when the McKesson &; Robbins scandal broke last December . How was it possible , the average investor asked , for $18,000,000 in fictitious inventories to deceive seasoned accountants ? <P> SEC set out to answer the point with an investigation which is not yet completed . The American Institute of Accountants , chief C.P.A. professional association , also launched an investigation . Last week it issued its report , tantamount to an order to all Institute Accountants from now on . Its chief decision : that good auditing procedure calls for actual corroboration of inventories by physical tests , heretofore usually done only on specific request by the company . <P> Also published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many a day-Truth in Accounting* by C.P.A. Kenneth MacNeal , treasurer of Alden Park Corp. , Philadelphia real-estate concern . His thesis : " The great majority of contemporary certified financial statements must necessarily be untrue and misleading due to the unsound principles upon which modern accounting methods are based . " Some of his examples : A man invests $30,000 in 1,000 shares of General Motors at 30 . The stock rises , he sells it at 60 , and reinvests in 1,000 shares of International Harvester at 60 . His twin puts $30,000 into International Harvester at 30 , it rises to 60 , and he keeps it . Each started with the same amount in cash , each ended with 1,000 shares of International Harvester , but according to accounting practice , one had $30,000 profit and the other none . <P> A group of financiers forms two identical investment trusts , each with identical portfolios . After a market rise , Trust X realizes its profits by selling its securities , but Trust Y does not . Accountants therefore certify that X had a large profit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rises on the news and Y 's falls . The financiers then sell their X stock at a profit , reinvest it in the depressed Y stock . Then they order Y to realize its profits by selling its portfolio . When the accountants certify this profit , Y 's stock rises , giving the unscrupulous financiers a profit at other stockholders ' expense . <P> <P> * University of Pennsylvania Press ( $3.50 ) .
