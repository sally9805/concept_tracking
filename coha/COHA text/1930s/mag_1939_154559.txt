For many a sentimental reader , the books of Novelist Harold Bell Wright ( The winning of Barbara Worth , The calling of Dan Matthews ) made many a dream seem to get up and walk . Last week the aged author 's solemn son Gilbert went his father one better : he made real people talk like waterfalls , braying donkeys , barking dogs , slamming doors , locomotive whistles . The appropriate place : Hollywood . <P> Six months ago , while Gilbert Hunger Wright was meditatively scratching the bristly whiskers on his Adam 's apple , he noticed that queer sounds came out of his mouth . When he silently mouthed words , the sounds caused by scratching his whiskers were formed into words . Fascinated , Gilbert Wright , who was once an engineer and radio operator , began to experiment further . Finally he came up with a device which his father , who by that time was also interested , christened " Sonovox . " <P> In the Sonovox , a sound recording of a waterfall , a vociferating animal , rattling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biscuit-shaped gadgets which are placed on each side of the throat against the larynx . These gadgets transmit the sound vibrations to the larynx , so that the sound comes out of the throat as if produced there . The sound is shaped into speech by mouthing the desired words . Thus a grunting pig , relayed through the human voice-box , can be made to observe : " It 's a wise pig who knows his own fodder . " <P> Walt Disney , as might have been expected , immediately offered to buy the exclusive Sonovox rights for cinema cartoons . Perhaps in the future Donald Duck will utter his irate comments in a real quacking duck 's voice . <P> Gilbert Wright , now a writer , used to be a cowpuncher , a lifeguard , a utility technician , a tutor . Born 38 years ago in Kansas , he graduated ( 1925 ) from the University of California , where he studied physics and mathematics . He taught math at a military academy for a year , took to writing short stories . Unwilling to capitalize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " John Le Bar . " Liberty found out who he was some years ago ; since then he has signed his own name to his fiction . <P> He has had cinema jobs off &; on , worked on the original screen play of Thanks for Everything . Twice married , he has two children by his first wife . <P> Proud of the Sonovox , he does not regard it as a main-line achievement . Said he : " I 'm a writer by trade . If I have n't got a writing job , fine-I 'll fool around with this thing . But it 's writing I want to do . "
