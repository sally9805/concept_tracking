THE WOMAN OF ANDROS-Thornton Wilder-Boni ( $2.50 ) . <P> When Thornton Wilder wrote The Bridge of San Luis Rey it was read by more than 250,000 people . Most of them could not even pronounce the title correctly . Many are still arguing about what the story meant . Author Wilder 's books are polished , scholarly , classical . Nevertheless , the U. S. acclaims him . The secret of Author Wilder 's success is his style-one of the most readable styles ever produced by a U. S. writer . Highbrows call it limpid . Plain people call it pretty smooth . <P> The Story . The first part of The Woman of Andros , says Author Wilder , is based on the Andria , comedy of Latin Playwright Terence ( circa 185-159 B. c. ) which in turn was based on two lost plays by Greek Playwright Menander ( 342-291 B. c . ) . On Brynos , one of the lesser islands of the Greek Archipelago , lives Chrysis the courtesan , the woman from Andros . She is the scandal of the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is both dignified and circumspect , but by her " airs and graces . " She gives weekly banquets , to which she invites all the most attractive young men : they discuss high matters of philosophy . " She cited often the saying of Plato that the true philosophers are the young men of their age . ' Not , ' she would add , ' because they do it very well ; but because they rush upon ideas with their whole soul . Later one philosophizes for praise , or for apology , or because it is a complicated intellectual game . ' " Chrysis recites Greek tragedies , of which she knows many by heart . Occasionally one of the young men is allowed to stay for the night . Many of them are in love with her ; none dreams of marrying her , for in spite of her superior education and her charm , her social position is not much better than that of a slave . <P> Her household is a queer one : marriage and children not being allowed her , she has adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but jealous abuse , but on whom she can spend-her affection . She knew that " life had no wonderful surprises after all and that its most difficult burden was the incommunicability of love . " Chrysis thinks she has grown beyond passion , but in spite of herself falls in love with Pamphilus , most silent of her guests , the son of the principal man on the island . But one day Pamphilus meets Chrysis ' younger sister , Glycerium , who has been kept hidden in the house , and who has stolen out for a walk . They become lovers ; when Glycerium is pregnant she tells her sister , who is ill , and the shock hastens Chrysis ' death . Glycerium dies too , in childbirth ; the queer household is sold into slavery ; and nothing is left of Chrysis but the memory of a few young men , and the epitaph she once spoke for herself with no one to hear it but the sea : " Stranger , near this spot lies Chrysis , daughter of Arches of Andros : the ewe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day and dies at a great age when the sun sets .
