Published letters and diaries , even if scandalous , create scandal for only a few years . Burned ( like Byron 's letters to his sister , Richard Burton 's diaries ) , they scandalize a writer 's name for good . Expurgated ( like Pepys 's diaries , Horace Walpole 's letters ) , they start gossip which endures as long as the suppressed letters and diaries remain locked in bank vaults . After 50 , 100 , 150 years their outmoded revelations seem singularly innocent . <P> A good case in point is the recently published , unexpurgated , eight-volume edition of The Greville Memoirs : 1814-1860 , edited by Lytton Strachey &; Roger Fulford ( Macmillan , $80 ) . First published in an expurgated edition in 1874 , nine years after hooknosed , cynical-lipped , elegant Charles Cavendish Fulke Greville 's death , they seemed to Queen Victoria in " DISGRACEFULLY bad taste . " Lord Winchilsea compared them to a life of the Apostles written by Judas Iscariot . Historians and biographers have long since ranked them among the greatest English political diaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red-covered notebooks were suppressed and because they were written in simple code the general impression remained that Greville 's Memoirs were filled with indecent gossip . <P> Far from confirming this impression , the unexpurgated diary shows Greville as extremely scrupulous-too scrupulous-in omitting just this kind of Pepysian gossip . His diary deals almost entirely with serious political events-Cabinet crises , diplomatic juggling , Queen Victoria 's shrewish squabbles with her ministers . Its value : that Greville , a shrewd and accurate reporter , wrote from the inside , that most of the leading political and literary figures of the day-the Duke of Wellington , Palmerston , Peel , the Princess de Lieven , Macaulay-were his friends . His scandals - such as the lustful Duke of Cumberland 's attack on Lady Lyndhurst-are those with direct political repercussions . <P> On the personal side , Greville 's diary is interesting chiefly for the light it throws on his curious motive for writing it . Despite His aristocratic connections , his wealth , his membership in the Privy Council , his welcome to the most exclusive social , political and intellectual circles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His sober diary was a means to improve his mind , a penance for his sins . <P> His bitterest self-reproaches , occurring every few months , centre on his love of horse-racing . After winning 4,000 at Newmarket he broods : " I herd with the vilest and stupidest and most degraded of beings . ... " After an evening with encyclopedic Thomas Babington Macaulay , Greville ranks himself with the worms , compares his mind to " a hurdy-gurdy in the Street " and Macaulay 's to " the great Organ at Haarlem.
