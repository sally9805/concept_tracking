The career of Walt Disney has given many artists something new to think about . They like to think that movie animation is in its infancy , that Silly Symphonies are preludes to Serious Symphonies which will employ all the resources of painting wedded to music and cinemaction . The obstacle that many of them bleat about : no film company will back anything but popular entertainment . Last week in London an original artist named Len Lye , working on a shoestring , crashed through with an animated movie called Color Flight which previewers hailed as art , as entertainment , and as the freshest stuff of its kind since Disney arrived . <P> Color Flight is a four-minute visual and musical experience that resembles a roller coaster ride through a kaleidoscope to the accompaniment of a swing band . Actually , it is a 400-foot ( half a reel ) short , translating into the terms of color and movement a rumba played by the Lecuona Cuban Boys and Honolulu Blues , a swing classic played by Red Nichols and his Five Pennies . Very unobtrusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain 's General Post Office Film Unit- to advertise Imperial Airways . About ten years of experimenting and five previous color productions+ helped make Color Flight an intensely exhilarating work of cinemart . It was made entirely by Len Lye himself , took nine weeks of work , cost $2,500 . <P> The stunt on which Color Flight is based - making visual equivalents of sounds- is familiar to art students , who often take sketch pads to concerts and try to " draw " the music . Hollywood has lately caught on , and An Optical Poem by Artist Oskar Fischinger , a visual translation of Liszt 's Second Hungarian Rhapsody , was released last spring by MGM . In Len Lye 's new and slicker film , the hot music not only is heard but appears as a complex , fast-changing pattern of brightly or subtly colored shapes . Simultaneous with the trumpet notes of Red Nichols ' solo a vertical ribbon of cold green light vibrates on the screen , sways against a violet background . Drum beats appear as expanding dark blobs and are wiped away . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The Disney Silly Symphonies are the product of a big corporation employing 75 animators , 150 copyists and a gang of gagmen , musicians and technicians . They are first drawn on large celluloid sheets , superimposed and then photographed one by one . Len Lye , however , paints or stencils his designs by hand , slowly and methodically , on the thin ribbon of film stock itself . Some of the names Len Lye gave to musical effects : " a splurged woomph " ( drum beat ) , " a **25;2057;TOOLONG " ( violin ) , " flutter " ( clarinet ) .
