In 1932 the U. S. people made a decision of far greater historical import than the choice of a new Chief Executive . For better or for worse , the U. S. people decided that it would not put up with deflation-the price that capitalism has always had to pay for its periodic excesses . What the U. S. wanted was a President who would " do something . " And doing something meant preventing the country from going through the wringer . <P> Herbert Hoover tried to ease the pain of liquidation but the voters wanted complete relief . So they elected the other candidate . Franklin Roosevelt ditched his economy platform and did what any other man would have had to do in the same position : he gave the U. S. what U. S. wanted-a heroic economic shot in the arm . <P> Last week President Roosevelt finally and officially admitted that the U. S. was in another Depression . Recognition of its existence took the form of a special message to Congress in which he proposed to end the Depression . His proposition : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons and rationalizations given to Congress in the message were repeated in the President 's subsequent fireside chat ( see p. 10 ) . But the nub of the message was simply : " Viewed from every angle today 's purchasing power-the citizen 's income of today-is not sufficient to drive the economic system at higher speed . " Thus the program itself was founded on the old pump-priming theory with five billions in cash and credit to do the trick . By various bits of legal and financial legerdemain the net cost to the taxpayer was described hopefully as a mere billion and a half . According to the President this would provide him with the " three rounds " of ammunition needed to down Depression . <P> Round No. 1 was straight Relief . The President asked for an additional appropriation of $1,250,000,000 for WPA for the first seven months of the next fiscal year starting next July . He also asked for an extra $300,000,000 for CCC , National Youth Administration and the Farm Security Administration . The total of $1,550,000,000 would enable the Government to maintain relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month . <P> Round No. 2 amounted to an about face in the Treasury 's recent credit policies , which helped bring on the Depression . A year ago when Government 's prime concern was not Depression but a runaway boom , the Federal Reserve Board boosted bank reserve requirements . This cut down the total of potential credit in the form of excess bank reserves and made money a little more expensive to borrow . Last week the President told Congress it was now time to lower reserve requirements-which the Reserve Board did forthwith . Net effect of lowering reserve requirements was to increase excess reserves from $1,700,000,000 to $2,400,000,000 . That is enough to support a credit expansion of perhaps $15,000,000,000-if businessmen would borrow .
