In an atmosphere of optimism and harmony , the leaders of both labor and employer groups prepared last night for the hearings on the dress industry code which are to begin in Washington Tuesday . Agreement to Be Put Into Code . The agreement reached is binding in itself , however , it was explained last night by both union and employers ' association officials . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union . Under the present plans it will be embodied in the permanent code for the industry and thus the authority of the United States Government will be behind its'enforcement. - The settlement as framed by the board of governors of the National Dress Manufacturers Association and a committee of the garment workers union and approved by the manufacturers ' association yesterday Included the highly controversial points at issue . Minimum wage scales for New York City , one of two points to be worked out , were finally decided upon early this morning after a conference , lasting four or five hours , between representatives pt the unions , manufacturers , jobbers ' and contractors in the local offices of the NRA . In announcing the i settlement of the dispute on wages , Grover A. Whalen , head of the local NRA movement , hailed it as the biggest victory for his group thus far . The minimum wage scales , effective as soon as work is resumed , are as follows : Cutters , $45 per week . The union had demanded $50 and the employers had offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimum of approximately $31.50 per week . They had demanded $44 and had been offered $24.50 . Examiners , $21 per week . They had asked $26 and had been offered 515.75 . Pressers , $1 per hour or a minimum of $35 per week . They had demanded $50 . Drapers , $27 per week .

Sample makers , ' $30 per week . They asked $35 and were offered $22.75 . The agreement stipulated that where workers were receiving wages above these scales . their wages would not be reduced . After reaching this agreement , the conferees began discussing wage scales for workers outside of New York City . The other point that was to be settled involved the question of responsibility of jobbers and manufacturers employing contractors for wages and working conditions in contractors ' shops . The principle of responsibility was accepiled but it was evident that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be worked out to insure this . This point had not been decided early this morning but it was explained that this did not affect the-plans to end the strike . Now the three associations which are cortcerned with the National Dress Manufacturers Association will send representatives to the local headquarters of the National Recovery Administration to ratify the agreement . No doubt has been expressed that they will accept the settlement . These associations are the Affiliated Dress Manufacturers , Inc. ; Wholesale Dress Manufacturers Association and the United Dress Manufacturers Association . Settlement Praised . The strike settlement was hailed on all sides  --  the employers , the workers and the National Recovery Administration , as represented by Grover A. Whalen , its New York chairman  --  as a great step forward . " You have done a fine , patriotic job , and I congratulate you , " Mr. Whalen told the manufacturers yesterday after they had voted about 9 to 1 to accept the agreement firoposals . David Dubinsky , president of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union and chief of the union 's negotiators , declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yestablished collective bargaining for the entire dress industry . The thirty-five-hour week should provide employment for thousands of unemployed dressmakers . The agreement reached spells the end of the sweatshop system . These achievements were due largely to the splendid ' efforts of Commissioner Whalen , and we also appreciate the helpful spirit displayed by the employers during these conferences . " Curb on Unscrupulous . In a lull in the night 's parleys on the wage scale , Alfred W. Lasher. president of the National Dress Manufacturers Association , issued a statement stressing the importance of providing protection for the ethical manufacturer against the unscrupulous competitor . " A point being stressed by the national association in our discussions with the union , " he said , " is the need for thoroughly adequate protection for the fair-minded , high standard employer against substandard competition . The members of the national association , in entering into a collective agreement with the union , would be at a serious disadvantage if the many firms not affiliated with our organization were to be . permitted to operate without some thoroughly defined control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intention of the national association to enlist the aid of the union in having the major features of the collective agreement included in the forthcoming code for the dress trade . " The schedules of wages and hours agreed upon by the conferees will be made part of the code and , in that manner , the collective contract will become binding upon the trade as a whole . There is precedent fox this in the coat and suit code wfiich was signed by President Roosevelt on Aug. 5 . " This provides that the terms of the collective agreement in that trade shall have the same force and effect of the contract itself . " Realignment of Associatioaas . Mr. Lasher also referred to the three other associations in the industry and remarked that they are under contractual relations with the union , their contracts expiring on Feb. 1 next . He said that they had been affected by the strike , however , and that a realignment of employers ' associations was likely . Earlier in the day he had intimated that ' , the industry might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of workers . " It is the desire of the manufacturers , " said Mr. Lasher , " to make the dress industry the first to walk down the line arm in arm with labor to NRA headquarters in Washington . " Mr. Lasher expressed resentment at what he termed misrepresentation of the National Dress Manufacturers Association as comprising proponents of sub-standard . or sweatshop conditions . " The truth is , " he said , " that our group consists of those employers in the industry , organized and unorganized , who have felt the absolute need for uniform labor conditions . " Mr. Lasher said that it was a mistake to call the- endorsement of the collective bargaining a victory for any side . What had been done in the past two days , he said , was , in reality , " a victory for economic reconstruction under the NRA . " Message to Roosevelt . agreement worked out at the allnight session in the Hotel Pennsylvania was presented to the members . Its terms provided for collective bargaining , the thirty-fivehour week , the elimination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the assumption of responsibility by jobbers and manufacturers for wages and conditions in the shops of contractors whom they employ . Mr. Whalen recommended recognition of the Association of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union , saying that it represented the majority of the strikers , and that it was better to negotiate labor agreements through one large organization rather than through a host of small ones , each in a different group of shops . He emphasized that such recognition would be a strong weapon against Communist workers who have been active during this strike . Many manufacturers asked Mr. Whalen questions from the floor , their chief interest being in the collective bargaining provision . When at last a vote was taken , nine-tenths of the 400 members present rose to their feet in the affirmative and cheered and applauded the decision . Mr. Whalen presided at last night 's conference tat NRA headquarters . Just as it opened he received a medal from Percy S. Straus , president of R. H. Macy &; Co. , in honor of his settling the strike . - It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-being of man is forged on the anvil of industry and made available through the channels of trade . " In a letter accompanying the medal , Mr. Straus wrote : " I told you that if you settled the needle trades ' strike I would give you a medal " The New Jersey Dress Manufacturers and Contractors Association issued a statement yesterday , its president , Harry J. Rubinstein , denying that the association desired to continue open shops . The association includes manufacturers in New Jersey and Connecticut . He asserted that dress contractors in New Jersey and Connecticut did not maintain sweatshops , as has been charged , but that " on the basis of the productivity of labor " in those States , " the contractors in those two States pay as high , if not higher rates than are being paid for similar work in the dress industry in New York City . " Yesterday passed with no disorder whatever in/ the strike .

Fifteen hundred strikers affiliated with the Needle Trade Workers Industrial Union , a left-wing organization , met in Union Square and were urged by their leaders to , stay aiiirly from work until their wage demands were satisfied .

Magistrate Guy Van Arnringe admonished them to picket in an orderly manner and they would not be disturbod . In behalf of the association , Mr. Lasher telegraphed the result of the conferences to President Roosevelt , saying in part : " Our sole purpose was to prepare a recovery plan for this trade in collaboration with the government . If this aim can be more effectually achieved through a collective labor agreement , we readily accept that procedure . " The action of the manufacturers in accepting the terms was taken at a mass meeting yesterday noon at the Hotel New Yorker . It was closed to non-members of the association . Mr. Lasher presided .
