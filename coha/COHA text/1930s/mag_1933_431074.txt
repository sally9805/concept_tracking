 | THE Devil must either be asleep or having trouble with his mother-in-law , or we should never have got through so quickly ! " This is what one of my father 's Eskimos remarked after they had made a particularly successful but dangerous crossing of an icechoked strait . The same thing held good for last summer , because , in spite of all kinds of unforeseen obstacles , the work we went to Greenland to accomplish was finished two weeks ahead of schedule time . Neither Captain Bartlett nor I drew a free breath until we saw the memorial to my father standing completed on the windswept summit of Cape York , but being a woman I derived an added feeling of gratification from the fact that every one at home had told us that it was absolutely impossible to build a sixty-foot stone monument in the short time allotted to us by the Arctic climate . I do n't have to say " I told you so ! " That splendid monument says it for me . We left New York the morning of June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I confess to having had numerous qualms at the idea of being the only woman among twenty-seven men , but with my two boys for company , and Captain Bob , Dad 's former skipper , to turn to in time of trouble , I was sure everything would be all right . The boys , of course , had no qualms of any kind . The state of excitement under which they had been laboring for months was firmly recorded on their school reports , and I was worried only for fear the trip would fall short of their great expectations . Edward , aged fourteen , was equipped with a regular arsenal , including a .22 , a shot gun , and a Winchester .44. while Peary , twelve years old , was looking forward to his first trip on a small sailing vessel . Undoubtedly the Morrissey was small . I knew that she was a twomasted schooner , only one hundred feet long , - but somehow figures do n't visualize themselves for me . It was only when I heard a man on the dock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rowboat as to go to sea in the Morrissey that I paused to look her over . Nor was I greatly comforted by another remark from the crowd to the effect that the ship was surely loaded for the bottom ! But we were off at last , and we certainly looked more like a seagoing barnyard than a seriousminded Arctic expedition ! Every conceivable place on deck was full to overflowing , and as a crowning touch we had two dozen chickens , two pigs , and a blueblooded jersey cow , all gifts for the Captain 's mother in Brigus , Newfoundland , our next port of call . Next morning I was awakened by the crowing of roosters , surely a strange sound when you know yourself to be miles out at sea ! We were running at slow speed through a thick fog , and every time a distant vessel blew its fog horn , our cow obligingly moo-ed an answer ! I soon discovered that there was still more livestock on ' board . The second night out we were aroused by a  | shout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughter ! One of the young naturalists on board had brought along an assortment of toads , turtles , and snakes in order to make movies of the reactions of the Eskimos when they saw them , for there are no reptiles in the Arctic . To the embarrassment of their owner , these creatures had a disconcerting habit of escaping and wandering around the ship . At this particular time the skipper , who was ignorant of the presence of such things on board his vessel , had been awakened from a sound sleep by a toad , which had come and nestled in his armpit . I was told afterward that if only the skipper 's reactions . could have been filmed , the picture would have been unique ! My quarters on board were tiny , one room ten feet long and six feet wide at the widest , although it quickly narrowed down to a three-foot alleyway . There was no porthole or window , just a companionway leading , by means of a flight of stairs , to the deck above . The companionway scuttle could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stormy weather , when it had to be shut , I had neither , except what came in through my doorway leading into the mess room . In this little cubby hole I ' not only lived for three and a @#  | half months , sharing it with my youngest boy and keeping in it the clothing , equipment , books , guns , cameras , etc. , for the three of us , but I considered myself quite comfortable ! I was the only one on board who had sheets , a privilege which entailed washing them myself , but it was worth it , for I could not bear the thought of sleeping between blankets which would have to go unwashed throughout the trip ! Our stay at Brigus was short , only long enough to set the cow safely ashore and take on a few additional supplies . Headed north again , we ran into a real storm . Fortunately the wind was in our favor , and we simply scudded along toward Greenland , but such waves as there were ! The Morrissey must surely be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time , and she aired her accomplishment for five days and nights ! Great waves towered over her stern and , breaking across her decks , swept forward . Or , for variety , curled their green crests over the sides or the bow . One husky sailor was washed the length of the ship , and we almost lost him . No one was allowed on deck who was not necessary to the handling of the ship , and as a final touch strips of canvas were nailed over the mess-room skylight and the entrance to my companionway in an effort to keep out the water . It gave me a horrible feeling of being trapped , especially when the ship rolled over on her side , down , down , down , until it seemed as if she could never right herself again , and I tried to figure the best way to get the boys out of their bunks and on deck before she capsized completely ! In spite of the protecting canvas sea water came down my stairs as if poured by the pailful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my time on my bed , partly because it was the dryest spot and partly to keep from being knocked about . I had to wedge myself in with pillows in order to remain in place , and when I went in to meals , I pulled on my rubber boots ! Fortunately none of us was seasick ! Our food during the storm was of the sketchiest , because the galley was being flooded constantly , and the motion of the ship was so violent that in spite of complicated arrangements with wires and strings it was next to impossible for Billy , the cook , to keep anything on his stove . So we lived on lukewarm canned soup and pilot crackers and yearned for better weather . It came at last , and just a month from the day we left New York we were in sight of our destination , Cape York , North Greenland . It was here that my father always made his first stop on the way north , to collect his native hunters and their indispensable dog teams . It was here that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his own letters , already months old . And it was here that we  | hoped to build the sixty-foot stone monument to his memory , here on the fifteen-hundredfoot cliff which is Cape York . We arrived at the Cape a little before nine in the morning of a beautiful day , and to our delighted surprise we were able , under skillful guidance from the crow 's nest , to pick our way between floes and drifting icebergs and to moor the ship to the face of the glacier , exactly as if she were alongside a wharf . We started at once for the summit to reconnoiter the site for the monument . It was one of the most tiring climbs I have ever undertaken . We had been sitting around on the ship , unable even to walk the decks because of their crowded condition , and we were all pretty soft , but it would have been a tough climb under any circumstances . The glacier was covered with deep snow that was beginning to melt , so that at every step we sank down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to take the next step . As fast as we reached the top of one slope , another arose in front of us ! Hidden crevasses made the climb dangerous as well as difficult , and several times a tragedy was narrowly averted . After several hours of climbing we finally reached the top . For the last hour I had been so tired that the only way I could keep going was to watch the feet of the man ahead of me and try not to look forward and see how much farther we had to go ! How glad I was the boys had remained on the ship ? Our weariness was quickly forgotten , however , when we saw what an ideal site for a monument we had found . Not only was it the highest point of the entire promontory , but it was covered with loose rock and stones of all shapes and sizes , ideal for building purposes . There was one thing at least which would not have to be carried up those fifteen hundred feet ! Back on the ship once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution of our problem of how to transport fifteen tons of cement , the metal cap , the tools and equipment et cetera , et cetera from the ship to the site , was Eskimos and dog teams . So we wasted no time , but had the anchor hoisted and were off to Thule to ask permission of Governor Nielsen to employ native assistance . GOVERNOR NIELSEN not only welcomed us cordially and placed every facility at our disposal , but generously loaned us one of the Thule Eskimos to act as our interpreter . This Eskimo turned out to be no less a person than Inughito , who as a boy had been mess boy for two winters on my father 's ship , the Roosevelt . Later he had distinguished himself as one of Knud Rasmussen 's companions on his stirring trip along the north coast of Greenland . The meeting between Inughito and the Captain was a touching one , and we were all glad to welcome Inughito as an old friend . However , I was scarcely prepared to find , when we were hack on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inughito sleep on a cot in the mess room ! Now , Inughito undoubtedly had a heart of gold , but just as undoubtedly , he was incredibly dirty , and I had the evidence of my own eyes that he himself was not the only living creature in his fur clothing . But when I told my tale of woe to Billy , the cook , he rose to the emergency and installed our new friend in the warm and comfortable engine room ! We left at once for Salvo Island , where we were to pick up our Eskimo helpers , but the ice was packed so thickly along the shore that we were unable to get near . But it was only a question of time before the natives would see us and come out to the ship with their teams . We were all so absorbed watching for the first glimpse of the natives that it was not until a grinding crash warned us that we realized that a huge iceberg had drifted down upon us and was slowly squeezing us between itself and the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lose , and every one sprang into action . Already the ice mass had splintered off the end of the main boom . There was something sinister in the silent , resistless way that the berg bore down upon us . Each man seized one of the stout hickory poles hanging ready in the rigging , and some from the deck and some from the ice fields beside us began to push with their united strength against the berg . At the same time the engines were signaled " Full speed ahead ! " The Morrissey , however , could not go ahead easily , as there was a companion berg , not quite so large as the first one , already swinging in toward our bow . A few more seconds and we would have been blocked completely , but Captain Bob worked the ship back and forth , in and out , with all the skill and dexterity of an expert driver parking his car in a small place . Gradually it could be seen that we were gaining room , and at last we were free , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boom . It was a close call , and never again did we forget to keep a sharp lookout , for if you relax your vigilance for so much as a single second , the " friendly Arctic " is liable to trap you ! Finally a shout announced the approach of the long-awaited dog teams . It was a stirring sight to see them skimming over the ice toward us . Each sled was drawn by eight or ten dogs hitched fan shape , and with their eager , pointed muzzles and their tightly curled tails they were lovely to watch . Their drivers came swarming up over the side , and to my great delight I discovered that one of them was Ootah , my father 's favorite hunter and the last living one of the four Eskimos who had accompanied my father to the North Pole . When Ootah recognized me , he was too moved to speak , and at the sight of my boys , grandsons of his well-loved commander , he could only murmur over and over " Now I Oh ! Now I Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we were going to build a WE monument to " Pearyoksoah , " their name for Dad , and that we wanted to take them and their families and dogs over to Cape York to help us . They said they would go ashore at once and get their families and hurry right back , and in less time than you would believe possible they were back again , bag and baggage , even including an infant that had been born only an hour before ! I might add that the mother walked to the ship beside her husband 's sled ! Men , women , and children were helped on board , and the sleds hauled up after them , as well as the struggling , yelping dogs . These last were deposited in a pen that had been hastily built to accommodate them , and I watched proceedings with some misgivings , the pen being on deck directly over my bunk ! My worst fears were realized , for all night long those dogs snarled and yelped and fought ! One in particular seemed to have either chronic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest had quieted down he kept up a sort of subterranean gargle that ended by getting on the nerves of the other dogs ( just as it did on mine ) and brought forth a chorus of yaps and barks and every so often precipitated a fight . The thud , thud of their feet seemed tight in my cars , and when occasionally one of the Eskimos entered the pen and tried to make peace , his efforts only increased the uproar . It was a wild night ! But next morning I forgot it all when I found that it was a perfect day and we were anchored in the harbor of Cape York , ready to begin the landing of equipment and supplies . The first boatload , containing the men who were to live on to ' the mountain and build the monument , was soon off , quickly followed by their camping gear , for the first and most important thing was to see the workmen adequately housed . Then the whaleboats were lashed together , a flooring of lumber laid across them , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone by , we could see the - trail-breaking sled start up the face of the glacier . From then on , everything went along in jig @#  | time , and every one worked with a will . The Eskimo women were busy meantime , making a settlement on the beach above high water . Here they would live for six weeks at least , and it was remarkable to see the competent way in which they went about their work , even finding time occasionally to lend a hand with the unloading of the whaleboats and the carrying of lighter articles . Eskimos are wanderers by nature , never having any permanent home , but living each season where the hunting is best . Therefore the women are adept at making themselves at home wherever they find themselves . By ten in the evening the job was finished , and we all went to bed contented with our first day 's work . But in the morning we woke to the horrible fact that it was snowing and blowing a gale . For five days the storm lasted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind blowing steadily all the time . It was heartbreaking . I did not dare to think about the men on the mountain top , for although they were safe enough , they could not help being miserably uncomfortable . The only cheerful thing was the way the Eskimos kept doggedly at their task of sledging supplies up to the monument site . Three round trips a day they made over the most terrible going imaginable . Each trip meant soaked footgear , and our engine room was always full of Eskimo women drying sealskin boots and rabbitskin stockings at the warmth of our cheerful oil burner . It was a time of great anxiety to me , because our working plan for the building of the monument allowed for no delays and would utilize every moment of the time at our disposal before the freezing of the sea should make our return home imperative . At the end of the week the weather finally cleared , but a note from the camp said the men were entertaining grave doubts as to the possibility of building a stone monument laid in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sample of what we were likely to have . Temperatures at the monument site had been below freezing most of the time , and even I knew that cement which froze before it set was useless . But my only reason for being with the expedition was to assume responsibility at a time of uncertainty , and so , with a bold front but with my heart in my mouth , I told the Captain that I would assume full responsibility for possible failure if the men would go ahead with the building and do the best they could under the circumstances . This seemed to be satisfactory to all concerned , although i was terrified at my own temerity , and the work was begun . ONE of the stimulating things about life in the Arctic is that no sooner do you solve one problem than another presents itself . Captain Bob said that we could not possibly feed the dog teams for any length of time with the provisions on hand and that the only thing to do was to go walrus hunting . So , making sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week or so , we took four of the best hunters on board and went after walrus . We were all more or less excited at the prospect , especially Junior , who would now have a chance to try his beloved .44 carbine . We sailed northward for several days , until finally one morning we came upon great herds of the walrus sleeping on the ice floes . The Captain offered to take the boys with him in his boat , and although I was scared to death at the idea , I thought I better go along , too . It would be much simpler for the folks at home if we were all three wiped out at the same time ! Besides , I would be so uneasy about the boys every moment that they were away that going with them was the lesser of the two evils ! Slowly and quietly our boat crept nearer and nearer to a floe on which about twenty of the huge beasts were sleeping . The Eskimo harpooners stood tense and ready in the bow . We  | came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten to give the signal ! When we were right under the sides of the ice , the Eskimos flung their harpoons , and immediately every animal plunged into the water with a tremendous splash and commotion . Two had been harpooned , and now they must be shot . But when the opportunity presented itself , the Captain 's expensive sporting rifle , the gift of some admiring friend , jammed , and he turned to Junior , saying , " Well , lad , it 's up to you ! " And to my huge surprise and delight , Junior killed the walrus ! A happier boy you have never seen ! To kill a walrus was a thrill , of course , but to kill the very first one of the hunt ! Junior 's eyes fairly snapped . On the way back to the ship , towing the " dead walrus which weighed over a ton easily , Junior said to me , " Wo n't Dahmama be pleased when she sees my walrus ? " With an inward groan I realized that Junior was probably planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trophy of his bow and spear . I was still trying to visualize myself picking my way around the bulk of a walrus in my beloved living room , when the Captain solved the difficulty by telling Junior just how far back to have the Eskimos cut off the head in order to have it look well when it was mounted . Of course , even a walrus head is not an objet d'art , but it is easier to live with than the entire beast ! ALL day the hunt went on , and when we had secured thirty walrus , the Captain decided that we had enough . The ship then cruised about among the ice floes , picking up the dead animals and hoisting them on board . As we were returning at once to the settlement at Cape York , the bodies , still steaming with animal heat , were just piled , one on top of the other , on the decks . Because of bad weather and head winds , we were five days making the return trip , and each day those walrus became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship where you could escape from what our radio operator humorously called the " aroma borealis . " How I wished that some of my friends who had envied me this " fascinating " trip could have been there ! The Eskimos were as pleased as children by the walrus meat , and day after day you could see them and the dogs expand under the influence of plenty of rich , sustaining food . Walrus has become so difficult to obtain that it is tasted by the Eskimos only at rare intervals , and to have thirty carcasses from which they could cut a slice whenever they wished seemed too good to be true . And that was not all . Their minds were definitely relieved of any anxiety regarding food for the winter . We had been particular to see that we had enough walrus to last the Eskimos until spring sealing . In this we were following a precedent established by Dad , who always saw that the men who worked for him during the summer , which is the best hunting season , were well supplied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Eskimos lay up their meat supply for the cold , dark season ahead , and if you utilize them for your own purposes at that time , it is only right and fair that you should make good to them their loss . The fact that the meat would gradually decay more and more did not detract a whit from their enjoyment . Before you shudder at this , think of some of the cheeses which are greatly prized by gourmets the world over ! It is only a question of local custom . Once back at Cape York , there began for me the happiest time of the whole summer . Every other day I climbed the fif teen-hundredfoot cliff to the site of the monument in order to see for myself the progress of the building . The men were really wonderful . They were uncomfortable , a lot of them were afraid of the approach of the dreaded Arctic night and the possibility of not getting home , and weather conditions were unfavorable most of the time , @#  | yet little by little they pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountain , I spent at the Eskimo settlement , watching the women at work , talking with them and playing with the children . I made it a point , whenever I went ashore , to take some little presents to them . They love surprises and cherish the most unexpected things . Sometimes I took them chocolate or chewing gum for which they are extremely eager . Sometimes I would have pipes for them and tobacco and matches , for they all smoke , even the tiniest children , and the Danes have given up all attempts to prevent it . Bright-colored scarves to wind about their necks or tie on their heads were popular , and they loved any kind of tin box with a tight cover . But my greatest success was with alarm clocks . The first one I gave to old hlayoo , one of the best seamstresses in the tribe . She had just made Bud a pair of sealskin pants which were the joy of his heart , and I wanted to do something extra for her . Her delight in the clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and snatched it up with -a shriek of joy , cradling it in her arms as if it were a baby . Then she turned on the alarm and rushed from tent to tent , thrusting the clock inside for the inmates to admire ! I never saw such genuine pride and pleasure ! I was surprised to find how quickly a working knowledge of the Eskimo language came hack to me . As a child , playing with the native children , I had been fluent in it , but I thought I had forgotten it all . Its return made my acquaintance with these people both interesting and profitable . A number of them remembered Mother and Dad well . Several had seen me as a baby , and they all loved to tell me about the old days . As for my boys , the Eskimos took them right to their hearts . Finding that Bud 's name was really " Peary , " they immediately called him " Peary mikky shoop a doo " meaning " tiny Peary , " to distinguish him from his grandi father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " great Peary . " Junior 's name gave them more trouble , and for a while they simply called him " the one that goes bang ! bang ! " for you seldom saw junior without his gun . Later they * decided that " Junior " sounded very like the Eskimo name " Oo too ny ah , " and this they called him all the time he was among them . The boys immediately chummed with the Eskimo children and spent long hours on the bird cliffs , catching little auks for our ship 's larder . Junior used his shot gun to the awe and admiration of the native boys , while they used long-handled bird nets and taught Bud to do so also . WHEN Ootah was not busy , he would take the boys on his sled , showing them how to direct the dogs with the tremendously long whip which is the Eskimo substitute for reins . He seemed to look upon the boys as his own particular responsibility and was always on hand to see that we were well looked-out-for . He told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English , and gestures , stories of the trips he had made with their grandfather , and he described in all its detail the last famous trip to the North Pole , and the day spent there , taking observations , making pictures , and sledging over the surrounding ice . He had a real gift of pantomime , so that even when adequate words were lacking , his meaning was never obscure . His son , Egingwah , was the special pal of both boys , and they never went anywhere without him . The days slipped by , and the work on the monument went forward until at last we were ready to put the waterproof cylinder into the cornerstone . This was to contain a permanent record of the expedition , its purpose and its history , as well as some personal relics pertaining to Dad 's life . Among these were a stone from our home in Maine , where he had the only peace and quiet that he knew ; a needle book from the work basket of his mother , who @#  | had wielded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a replica of the flag which he carried to the Pole . Both original flag and replica were the work of my own mother , of whom Dad wrote , " She has been my constant aid and inspiration and has borne the brunt of it all . " While I was preparing the contents of the cylinder , Ootah stood watching me , and I carefully explained the significance of what I was doing , knowing that he would pass along the information . He listened intently , fingering the different objects , and then seemed to come to a sudden decision . Timidly , but with great dignity , he asked that his copper match box , which I knew was his greatest treasure , might be sealed in the cylinder also , as his tribute to his commander and friend . Only a few days later the metal cap was hoisted into place on the top of the monument , the scaffolding removed , and the memorial was completed . There remained now only the dedication ceremonies , and our seemingly impossible task would be finished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait four days for good weather in which to dedicate the monument . No wonder the Eskimos think the Storm Demon has his permanent abode at Cape York ! But Sunday , the twenty-first of August , dawned clear and bright , and immediately after breakfast the sleds started carrying passengers up the mountain . The Captain and I were among the first to go , because we wished to arrange the flags which had been given to us to fly on this special occasion . There were eight of them besides the flag of the United States , and over the memorial tablet , veiling it until the proper moment arrived for its removal , was my father 's personal flag . There were nearly fifty of us who assembled there that morning , fifty people who for over a month had had only one thought uppermost in their minds , the successful completion of the work in hand . The ceremonies were brief , but dignified and impressive . On the steps at the base of the monument were grouped Captain Bartlett ; Ralph Belknap , the engineer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his interest in Arctic work in general and my father 's work in particular ; Ootah , my boys , and I. The Captain made a brief speech in which he spoke of his love and admiration for Peary , the man , as well as the leader . At the end , as representative of the Peary family , I told how Peary had been the first to recognize the possibilities of the Eskimos ; he gained a working knowledge of their language and adopted their methods of dressing , hunting , and traveling , and to that he attributed his success . Knud Rasmussen says : " In return , Peary took the Eskimos from the stone age to the present time in their technical development . It is Peary who had given them their present effective equipment for winning a livelihood . " The flag was then drawn aside , disclosing the memorial tablet beneath , which reads : " Robert Edwin Peary , the first to lead a party of his fellow men to a Pole of the Earth , April 6 , moo . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he also determined the insularity of Greenland and discovered the Cape York meteorites . This monument to his memory is here erected in 1932 by his wife and children in grateful recognition of the devoted services of the Eskimo people . " It was an impressive moment for me , and I felt more strongly than ever that Mother should have been there , Mother who had been at Dad 's side through thick and thin , and , when she was unable actually to accompany him on an expedition , had sent him off full of confidence and the determination to win to his goal if it was humanly possible . Mother played such an important part in the discovery of the Pole that she should certainly have been there that day of all days . But it could not be , and @#  | so I tried to make the best of it and comfort myself by thinking of the pleasure it would be to tell her how well everything had been carried through . As the ceremonies were concluded , a fresh snow-storm burst over us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ship . The camp had already been broken up , and lumber , tools , and camping supplies divided among the Eskimos who had worked so faithfully . Now our work was done , and we were going to have a little fling before starting south . It had been my hope from the beginning that we would have time , after the monument was built , to go farther north and visit the native villages in Inglefield Gulf . I was particularly anxious to show the boys the site of the house where I was born , and 1 also wanted to see my old friend and comrade , Koodlooktoo . With Ootah and his wife and his son Egingwah , and Klayoo and her husband , and of course the indispensable Inughito , we said a temporary farewell to the rest of the natives and turned our ship north . EACH hour of each day now was a new excitement , as we went from village to village , for I never knew which one of my old friends I would see . Once on shore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious to see " Ahnighito " and her two sons , the grandsons of " Pearyoksoah . " I always had plenty of gifts to distribute , and I explained that these were given them in memory of Peary . Our visit on shore ended , I next invited the entire population of the village to come aboard the ship for coffee and biscuits . Invariably they accepted in a body and , once on board , behaved like happy children , peering into the engine room and investigating my quarters and clustering , laughing and chattering , around the huge coffee pot when Billy brought it from the galley . Nearly all of them had little presents for the boys and me , and when it came time to leave , we sent them ashore laden with biscuits and tea and sugar and as happy as larks . All of this , amusing as it was , was only a prelude for me to the real event to which I had been looking forward so long , seeing Koodlooktoo once more . As we came in sight of his village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had a wrist watch for him , and I could hardly wait to see his face when he received it . But the ship had actually dropped anchor before there was any sign of life on shore . Then two skin kayaks put off , but when they reached the ship they proved to be paddled by mere children . An epidemic of flu , the most fatal of all diseases to the Eskimos , had swept the village , and only that morning Koodlooktoo and his wife and youngest child had died . One of the boys in the kayak told us that even up to the last , Koodlooktoo had spoken with eagerness of the time when Ahnighito would come to see him . This robbed my remaining visits to the settlements of all pleasure , until we came to anniversary Lodge , in Bowdoin Bay , where I was born . There was no settlement , but Ootah went ashore with the boys and me and proved a splendid guide . The house had burned long ago , but it was easy to make out the site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melted glass from the big skylight which had gone the length of the house , and we found other souvenirs of the days when Dad and Mother had lived there . Ootah showed us where stone igloos had been built to accommodate Eskimos who came to visit ; he showed me the gravel bank where Mother gave me my daily sun bath , the spring after I was born . We even went up a little valley to the small pond which supplied the party with fresh water and had been named Baby Lake in my honor . The whole thing gave me a tremendous thrill , and even the boys , young as they are , seemed deeply interested . @#  | This was our last stop before turning south . We spent a day at Thule while the Danes there wrote letters home , for we would carry out the last mail it would be possible for them to send . While waiting , the boys and I wandered over to the Eskimo village where one woman shoved her daughter forward , saying proudly that the daughter could speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her beyond " Okay with me , big boy ! " and when we left , and I said " Good-bye , " she called after us , " Happy New Year ! " Thule was left behind us regretfully , and then came the still more difficult task of saying goodbye to our Eskimo friends . Klayoo and Ootah and their families were put ashore at our last stop , a peaceful , friendly valley where I like to think of them spending their last days as happily as the difficult struggle for life in the Arctic permits . At the very last I asked Klayoo if there was still something that she would like to have before I left her . At first she was reluctant to ask , but after much urging she admitted that there was something she would like , but she did n't know the name of it . She finally made me understand by going through the pantomime of shuffling and dealing cards ! Where she had ever seen a pack of cards in use I do not know , but when I gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ootah took me aside and showed me how plainly the monument could be seen from his igloo . He said he would think of Dad whenever he saw it , and that always , always he would hope to see Mother and me again . He added thoughtfully that he had known Peary and Peary 's wife and Peary 's daughter and grandsons ; perhaps in the future , the children of these grandchildren would come north and meet and know the children of his own son , Egingwah . As a farewell present he gave me his whip , the same one he had used twenty-three years before on his sledge journey to the Pole . I hated to say good-bye to him and was glad when the partings were over and we sailed away .
