. T HE Chicago World 's Fair . that greatest of these expositions , took place during my second American tour , and I was invited to appear there with Theodore Thomas ' orchestra , in a concert hall built especially for musical productions at the fair . This was in May , 1893 , toward the end of my tour . Chicago already had impressed me more than any other city in America . Although many persons , foreigners especially , imagine New York to have built the first . skyscrapers , it really was Chicago . There was already a perfectly tremendous building  --  I think , the Masonic Temple  --  twenty or more stories high . It was extremely impressive after the low sky line of New York . There was also a huge hotel called the Auditorium , which contained the concert hall in which I made my first Chicago appearance , then the largest hall in America . At that time , there were in my mind three objects of colossal dimensions in America which impressed me as being objects of condensed immensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Niagara Falls , the city of Chicago and the Grand Canyon . Yes , what a collection . But while Niagara Falls and the Grand Canyon were the results of brutal forces of Nature . Chicago appealed to me as being the result of all the tremendous , but intelligent , forces of mankind . The grounds of the World 's Fair were like a huge camp . It was a strange sight . All those leaders who were directing the exposition were practically living  --  really camping  --  there on the spot . We spent there , before the official opening of the fair and the concerts , about a fortnight , living in rooms which were not yet even finished . It was most uncomfortable . The plaster covering the walls was not yet dry . Everything had been put up in a burry . There was humidity everywhere , coming not only from the neighboring lake but from the dampness of the buildings . The Great Piano Controversy T HE committee had invited me to stay there , and it was a unique experience . I was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful , impressive address in the presence of at least half a million people . I never saw him again , though I saw Mrs. Cleveland many times  --  a very beautiful woman and distinguished First Lady . There was a man of real genius , Daniel Burnham , among the leading figures in the Chicago Fair . He was virtually the creator of all that was beautiful in Chicago then , a truly great architect and landscape engineer , and , above all , a man thinking of the good of his fellow citizens , and devoting to it all his energy . The Chicago concerts were most successful , but not without certain unpleasant surprises . The house of Steinway , for some reason known to themselves , did not exhibit at the fair . Their competitors , therefore , sought to prevent me from playing at the exposition on an instrument not exhibited there . It took all the skill and tact of Theodore Thomas and his friends to get the committee 's agreement . Finally I played the Steinway , without , however , having been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and continued for months in the newspapers , because every one of those competitors had some supporters , and they were fighting on legal grounds . There was no accident or mutilation to the piano during this quarrel , as sometimes happens . The strings of my piano were never cut in America as in other countries , where I have had dreadful experiences . For instance , in St .. Petersburg , I had been accustomed to playing the grard piano . I asked my good friend , M. Blondel , to send two concert Brands for the Russian tour in 1889 . He did so . When I came to the concert ball in St. Petersburg , half an hour before the arrival of the orchestra , I found , to my horror , that one of the pedals of the instrument was completely destroyed : and when about to try the piano , / found , between many of the keys , sharp pins standing up . I saw them , fCentinowd Aare 301 ( Coneinood from Pogo 28 ) thank God , before touching the piano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me on that tour , was wise enough to come with the piano into the hall , and remain there for the whole day and night , never leaving it . The reason for all this persecution was that I did not apply to the local piano agency in St. Petersburg , but brought my own piano . I was an intruder . The pedal had been ripped off with violence . Whoever did it was probably greatly disappointed when I came out and played . It was my debut there . After my successful second tour in . America , I returned as usual to Europe . In the summer of that year , 1S93 , I was living with my friends and my boy , in a little place in Normandy . For the first time in my arduous career , I could invite some people dear to my heart to spend a few weeks with me . My sister came to stay with me , and I was glad to see also my dear old friend , Kerntupf . I felt very happy then . This little reunion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a life of constant travel and work . My son was a child of ten or twelve then , and although he was very delicate I had a firm belief that he would outgrow his illness . After ten years of constant labor , this little breathing space was an oasis in a desert of work . I had time for many things now . I began then to compose again . I started a composition , a Polish Fantasia , for piano and orchestra , which I finished within five weeks . That Fantasia was performed by myself for the first time at the Festival of Norwich , England , under the conductorship of Mr. Randegger , a fine teacher of singing and an excellent conductor . A Venture in Operatic Music T HIS tour in England was the largest tour I had had so far . I played in all the provincial cities , and in Dublin , Belfast and Cork , besides recitals in London . At the end of the season , I made a decision that was of tremendous importance to me . I decided not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin the writing of my opera , Manru . IL happened in this way : A Polish writer and poet , Alfred Nossig by name , had approached me repeatedly with a proposition for writing a book for an opera . So , out of the several outlines suggested , I selected one . That book , though not then in its definite form , was sent me toward the end of 1893 , and became the libretto for my opera Alanru . And so I shut myself completely away from the world . I went to Italy for the first time , took the book with me and began to write the music . My stay in Italy was short , for I was suddenly called to Paris on account of my son 's illness . I remained then in Paris , living , not in my apartment but in a little house which I rented in one of the most-secluded quarters , where I lived quite alone . Only my servant came every day toward one o'clock and prepared my luncheon . This little house was in Pussy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there . This was necessary , as I was so well known by then that . my Paris apartment was a constant rendezvous for friends and musicians . My dinner I usually took in a little restaurant for coachmen . The food was excellent , and it was not unpleasant to see all these good people enjoying themselves after their work . I found a certain relaxation in it  --  and peace . Well , the opera proceeded satisfactorily , because within six months I finished two acts and began the third . Although I was not playing , I still suffered very much from my arm and fourth finger , and , upon the advice of a physician , I then went to Aix-lesSains for treatment . I rented a little chateau on the Lake of Bourget and made qui to a long stay . took the cure faithfully , and repeated that for several seasons , but without any good results . Nobody , not even the best physicians , seemed to know exactly what the trouble was with my fourth finger . It was a charming place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the many causes of my amusement , I must admit , was my friendship with a little dog that attached himself unexpectedly to me . Now , I have had two animals during my life that have shown a certain interest in music . One superficially , because music was , perhaps , only an attribute of my own personality , but the other one was really fond of music . The first was this dog . I took my daily bath and treatment at the thermal establishment . I always went in a carriage especially ordered , and I always had the same coachman , who was somewhat of a philosopher . One morning , as I was entering the bath , a little dog followed me for a few steps . Two hours later , when I came out of the bath , the same dog seemed to be waiting for me , for he wagged his tail delightedly . He was a dug of no particular breed , and certainly no particular beauty , but he seemed intelligent and very affectionate . I was exhausted after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one thought  --  to get home . To my surprise the dog followed the carriage , he came to the chateau with me . He refused to leave , and there he remained for three months , my constant and devoted companion . He used to sleep in my room , eat his meals at my feet and was close beside me day after day as I wrote . In fact , during the whole summer that dog was always at my side . I named him Brisefer. 11'ell , he won my heart completely . I have never known a dog like him . My sister , my poor boy and everyone got to lie very fond of him , but a fortnight before our departure the dog changed completely . He became so sad , melancholy and desperate . He sensed our departure , we all felt . Whenever he came to my little tower , he would it and look up at me just like a human being . He would moan and cry . It was heartbreaking to listen to him . I said to myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog . I must take him to Paris . It . would he cruel to leave him behind . He will die if he is separated from me . There is no other way ; he must go with me . " And so it was arranged . The day of departure arrived and the dog went with us to the station . I had already bought a ticket for him , and I said to Marcel , my dear old valet , " Be sure and put him in the carriage with us . He must not be separated from us on the journey . " Marcel hurried off with the dog and tried to put him in our carriage , but he became suddenly very ugly . He not only barked furiously but attacked Marcel . We were all dumfounded . I called hiM by all his pet names , but he only glared at me , showed his teeth and turned away . I called again , " Come , come , Brisefer . " I wont toward him , but he became more and more ferocious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and actually ran away from us . It was " all off , " as you say in America . What an ending to our friendship ! And what a mystery I The next year I went again to the Chateau de Bon Port and began the baths once more . " Perhaps , " 1 said , " I shall see our friend , Brisefer , again . " I confess I wanted to see him . He was still a mystery to me . Well , I did see him , the day after my arrival , and I was delighted at the sight . of him . I called to him , but he did not even turn his head . He took absolutely no notice of me . Again my old coachman was driving . He watched the proceedings and seemed much amused by my efforts . " Oh , do n't bother with him , " he said finally . " Why , what is the matter with him ? " " Oh , " the coachman answered , " he is just . a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not care for you any more . He does that to everybody . That 's his way . Every year a new master  --  that is his habit . He 's no good . " The coachman laughed and said , " You ca n't get him back . Do n't try . He 's a fraud , I tell you . He has no gratitude or affection . He does n't care about you any more . " But I was not at all convinced . I still felt I could win him back . Such was my vanity , I offered him some attraction ; I stopped at the butcher 's , much to the disgust of the coachman , and bought a large piece of meat for him , but he snarled and ran away . He knew perfectly well that he was not acting correctly , so he let it appear that he had never known me . A very human trait .. I had not expected to find it in a dog , I must say . But after our last encounter , I realized the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a fraud ! Return to Concert Work I SPITE of this disappointment , that season at Aix- 1 les-Baits was one of accomplishments . I finished my sketch for the third act of the opera . It was in this year that my poor father died . I had not seen him for several years . I was extremely busy all the time , building my career , and , moreover , I could not get a passport. , because at that time I was a Russian subject and , being a Pole , 1 had tremendous difficulty in obtaining a foreign passport . The last passport 1 was able to obtain before going to Lesehetizky in Vienna took me more than four months to secure . I had to go to every authority  --  to the county , to the district , to the province and even to the governor . It was purposely made very difficult for Polish people to get passports  --  practically impossible . My father had lived long enough to know of my success . lie was an old man then , and had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had been accomplished . But he did know , thank God , that I had made a big reputation . When he became ill , I bought a house for him in the little city of Gitomir . He loved that place and ended his days in that little house . As I began to prosper in life , I was able to provide peace and comfort for him to the end of his days . His death closed forever a chapter , as the death of a parent always does . He was a very noble man . and even physically he was always a strong , beautiful man . That is my abiding memory of him . I began to play again in 1895 . I was obliged to . I played , then , several times in Germany . I had a short tour in England and France too . By then , 1 was established brilliantly throughout Europe , with the exception of Spain , which came a few years later . That . tour , of course , put an end to my work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed money . My ten fingers were my fortune . The year before , I had been obliged to accept anew manager  --  a man very highly recommended by various friends . The man who had been with me previously and organized my concerts through France  --  Charles Cbevrier  --  had died . It was unfortunate that I had to make a change at this time . The new manager proved not to be as brilliant as all my friends had assured me . There were constant demands for money for the enterprises which he launched and which were not prosperous  --  quite the reverse . Now , a lifelong desire of mine was to have it little ? state of my own , a place with a beautiful forest and a stream of water . Instead of one estate , I practically got three , and there was never a forest on any of them . I just wanted to own a little property that I could enjoy , and so , with this in view , my new manager bought for me three properties tvilhoui Forests that I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I saw first and did want , and which proved to be an excellent affair and splendid investment , alas , slipped out of my hands . It . was a lovely place with a large forest and the little river running through it  --  a beautiful river  --  hut ah , my manager delayed ; he let it go and then bought me the others . The first estate was in Russian Poland . It was worthless to me because , first of all , there were no trees there . It was a good piece of land near a railway station and with a nice little stream , but the Forest had been absolutely cut down a few years before . The second was also in Russian Poland , but near the Austrian frontier . It was , I think , eighty miles From the railway . With my occupation , I could not go there to reside , so it , too , was impossible . Another mistake . The third one was bought in Austrian Poland . There were some nice features about that property , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I learned that I could buy afterward a little forest near by , which I did . For me , a forest is the greatest pleasure  --  to walk among the trees , because I love trees , to hear birds singing in them . That is an incomparable joy to me . Well , I got that little Forest , but after a few years I found that even my lucrative American tours would not be enough to keep it up and preserve it . and me . And so I parted with that third property at another big loss . Added to all this disappointment , this manager , when he received all the money that I entrusted to him , invested that money , alas , not for me alone , but for me and himself as a partner , and the investments proved to be disastrous . I lost a great deal and had no satisfaction in any way from them . ' I realized then that I could not earn one single penny except by my playing . lily ten fingers were my only fortune , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made for me , was always a loss . It was evidently my destiny . Whenever there was a possibility for me to make a brilliant investment , even a fortune , I had not the time to do it , because I was an artist and not a businessman . When I asked others to do it for me , my orders were not carried out and everything that was done proved to he ruinous . This fate has pursued me through life . Third American Tour T HAT summer of 1895 I prepared for the third American tour . That was a tremendous tour , covering the whole of the United States from " Maine to the Pacific , " as you say . It was u very great financial success . It was then that I visited California for the first time , and my experience in San Francisco during that tour was complete and perfect enjoyment . The beauty of the country , that transparency of the air , the kindness and hospitality of the people , made me Feel happy and content . I met there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory , preserve a warm affection . Incidentally , I had the opportunity of meeting Mr. Herbert Hoover , then a student at Stanford University . I spent in Han Francisco , after these concerts , one week more in order to be able to play in a concert given by the Belgian violinist , Marsick . The weather was gorgeous all the time . It was perfectly enchanting . When I first played in Los Angeles , it was a small town . Now it has about two million population . played in San Diego during that same season . It . was a tiny place , little more than a village , From the station to I he theater , or opera house , as it was called , perhaps half a mile , there was only one house , and that a gambling house . My audience was not From San Diego at all , for San Diego had no audience . They came from the Coronado Beach Hotel , which Wn.s in full swing then . in many respects America seemed a fairy tale to me from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which at the beginning of my career were rather small , were very attentive . They came From the small surrounding places and the majority of them came with their music in hand , with the notes to follow me . They were either students or teachers of music , the first , to have a kind of lesson , shall we say , and the second , to renew their memories . They followed me reverently with their music . It was all very touching . They were a musical congregation , I always felt . It interested me enormously because music was not yet , as it is now , a part of general education . But I am sorry to say that a great change is now taking place . The radio and the records , and especially something that has nothing to do with music and everything to do with speed  --  the automobile  --  are injuring music frightfully , in my opinion . I remember particularly two concerts in Kansas City . Several hundreds of people arrived from Texas by special train , all armed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and touching sight . They crowded the hotels ; they gathered in ( lusters at the street corners and they stood in line in front of the box office  --  all with their music in hand . A great friend of mine from Dallas , Texas , a Mr. White , a music teacher and a splendid fellow , himself brought fifty pupils to that concert . During that season , I had in my audience in Los Angeles people who came from Phoenix , Arizona , and it was at Salt Lake City that a train full of music lovers , young students from towns many miles away , came to hear me . It was not until 1897 that I made my debut in Italy , at Rome , I could tell you much of that pleasant experience , but I find it diffieult to keep that happy balance between void , dry statements of eoneert after concert , and the great desire to talk on indefinitely of people . Everywhere there are interesting and charming people . The Warsaw Teachers Change Their Opinions E XCEPT for Italy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to complete the sketch of my opera and begin its orchestration . I had been in Dresden , and there , after having played some charity concerts , again under the auspices of the good old Queen of Saxony , I had a talk with the director of the Opera , Ernst Schuvh . He was a conductor of genius , especially in the opera . He insisted upon hearing some parts of my opera on the piano , and asked me to give him the first performance of it in the Royal Opera House there . So I was bound to get that opera finished quickly . On the whole , about two and a half years were spent working on it . I could not write continuously and there were intervals in which I was entirely out of the mood of the composition , but I finally did succeed in scoring the first act . Everything stopped then because I had already made engagements for my tour in Russia . That was my first tour since the youthful disaster twenty years before . I gave three concerts in Warsaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first appearance as an artist of reputation in the city where I had studied as a boy . These concerts were memorable For me , because I was received with exceptional honors and was offered many proofs of esteem and recognition on the part of my compatriots . Banquets were given , many addresses made , and so 011 . But it was rather pathetic to see some of my old teachers  --  those who had predicted that I would never be a pianist . Several of them were still there . The man who said I would be a trombone player was no more , but the two piano teachers who always assured me I had better become a cobbler than a pianist were present , and looked extremely proud , as though they had said quite the contrary . It was at a banquet that I saw again my former beloved teacher or vounterpuint and composition , Roguski , to whom I shall never cease to be profoundly grateful all the years of my life . It was an occasion for us both . The dear old Kerntopfs were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pianos . That did not help me very much in producing a good impression . Although they were not bad pianos , exactly . it really was a great sacrifice ; but I did it gladly out of Friendship . For all concerts in Poland , I played their pianos , and . even in Kiev and Odessa . It was a simple acknowledgment of thanks for a great friendship . But oh , it was hard musically . I was greatly attached to the whole family , but to Edward Kerntopf went my whole gratitude . He was the axis of the whole wheel . He was proud , and rejoiced that I had justified his faith in me and that I had arrived where he expected me to be some day . After that short tour in Poland , I went to St. Petersburg . The first concert was with the orchestra , and then I gave three recitals . Those concerts were not only very well attended , but artistically , too , were extremely successful , though the conservatory , which at that time was the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great artist , Anton Rubinstein , was absolutely hostile to me . I played for the benefit of the students , but they would have none of it . ( Continued on Pogo 1021 I do not know whether it was because I was a Pole , but certainly they wanted to show that no other pianist could expect to be appreciated to such a degree in Rubinstein 's land and by his devoted followers . He was dead , but still that cult for his personality was so strong and so faithful that it took the form of a positive hostility to any other artist . These expressions in the press , especially that I was the successor of Rubinstein in public favor and really to be compared to him , hurt the feelings of his devotees . For them . I was simply an intruder . It was really unpleasant for me , because whenever I went where there were musicians , they immediately began talking about Rubinstein , as if they desired to tell me that I was not recognized by them and wanted to show me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to compare with Rubinstein in the world . The press , however , was excellent . One critic said that people who wished to make comparisons should remember that a great personality in art was not to be compared with anybody else but himself , and he added : " Some writers compare Mr. Paderewski with our glorious , never-to-be-forgotten Rubinstein , saying that he is a second Rubinstein . That is wrong , because he is the first Paderewski . " The Orchestra Colony The Trumpeter Prince The corridor was in the principal building , which was a musical museum with a collection of old instruments . There was something also particularly interesting to me in that museum . In one of the rooms there was a collection of paintings of famous Russian musicians , and I suddenly found , to my amazement , that my own likeness was among them , made by an artist in Paris . I found several reproductions of myself , the name underneath , but nothing added to it . Later , Baron von Stackelberg said . " These bas-reliefs are the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and accidentally saw them and liked them so much that he ordered several to be bought and put in this museum . " Baron von Stackelberg was pleased to tell me this . But ho bitterly deplored the fact that with all their spending of the tremendous sums of money needed for the upkeep of the orchestra , there was never a penny to build a proper hall for them to play in . There was ( Continued en Page 105 ) ( Cong.Inuod from Page 102 ) nothing he could do about it . The or chestra , which contained some eighty players , was a very costly affair . It was the orchestra for the private use of the Emperor . What luxury I The philharmonic concerts , on the contrary , where I played with the regular symphonic orchestra , were given in a large , comfortable half , and it was in the same hall that I afterward gave my recitals . But the orchestra of the Czar bad no place of its own . It was fantastic . I never had any audience with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the conservatory at Warsaw , when I was a member of that famous orchestra that brought so much trouble into my student days , we were ordered to play before the Czar . After we had played several pieces , 1 saw , to my horror , the crown prince , who later became Alexander III , walking directly toward me . I was playing the trumpet . It seemed that he played the trumpet himself . I was a boy then of fourteen or fifteen , and shy . He came straight to me and said , very eagerly , " Tell me . What kind of a trumpet do you play , my boy ? " For answer , I showed him my trumpet . " Oh , " he said , looking at it closely . " My trumpet is quite different . This is not like mine . " He then tapped me on the shoulder and went away without another word . Our first and last meeting . The first concert I played in St. Petersburg was for the benefit of poor students of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those students , because they made very hostile manifestations against me . They wanted none of me . A wasted effort . The last concert was chamber music , and I played two numbers with Auer , the renowned violinist , who was still very fine player himself , and Wierzbilowetch , who was a wonderful ' cellist . That concert was for the widows and orphans of former professors of the conservatory . Swing Music a la Russe From St. Petersburg I went on to Moscow . The director of those concerts was the director of the Moscow Conservatory , Safonoff , whom you may remember , as he conducted for several years in New York . He was a remarkable musician , a very good conductor and a very pleasant man . But he was afflicted with a thirst which apparently was unquenchable . Immediately after the rehearsal , he invited me to luncheon , and there I had the first opportunity of seeing to what extent he was thirsty and how difficult it was to try to equal him in his effort to quench that thirst . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NMI plainly aware of his contempt for my inability in that respect . He was a real Russian , and , therefore , anyone who could not equal him in drinking was a contemptible person , a weakling . He conducted very well ae the concert , but evidently he had dined just beforehand , and I thought that one of his guests must have been the horn blower of the orchestra , because during the performance that horn blower did incredible things ! He lifted his instrument high in the air . held it as though he were drinking from it , and:behaved altogether like a drunken or crazy man . This performance of his continued throughout the number , and he completely spoiled my own Fantasia , which I was Playing . But , to continue our story , Safonoff was a terrible fellow because he could drink without respite . In London I once invited him to dinner . He insisted upon being quite alone with me , as he had important things to say , he assured me. lie said he would come to dinner , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no corn panyabsolutely none . I want to talk with you alone to my heart 's content . " So I agreed . Well , he presented himself in the best of spirits , but did not seem at all eager to begin that long and intimate conversation with me . In fact , his whole attention was centered on the drinks . First of all , ho started with cognac , and drank three or four glasses before dinner ; he just tossed them off . Then came two bottles of white wine and one bottle of claret , two bottles of champagne  --  yes , I assure you I  --  followed by four more cognacs after his coffee . Then , to my amazement , lie asked for beer , and by actual count , drank six large glasses with the greatest . gusto . He was built . like an athlete . At that time , nothing affected him ; he was just like a rock . What a fellow he was ! And so lovable too . Recitals Under Handicaps But to return to the concert . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the antics of the drunken horn blower . After my Polish Fantasia , however , in which he made such a disturbance , there was some slight hostile movement in the audience , and that movement was toward me . I do not know whether it was caused by the behavior of the born blower or by the fact that the composition I was playing was a Polish Fantasia . Already , in Russia , there was a decided movement of particular hatred toward the Poles . The poor horn blower is dead , and I have forgiven him long ago . Safonoff , too , is dead . I have nothing to forgive him for . On the contrary , I have appreciation of his conducting and the most happy and jovial recollections of him . Only once did . he fail me very badly during the Russian tour , and what happened then showed me that , in spite of his friendliness , he did not really want me to make a success in Moscow . I do not know why . Perhaps we must say that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human nature . My first recital there was well attended , but not so full as the St. Petersburg recitals , which were absolutely crowded . I looked for Safonoff especially that night , and , to my surprise , I did not see him . After the recital , he appeared . a strange figure , as he was in his morning suit. , while everyone else was in full dress . He had on a shabby little waistcoatand was very , u n tidy , " Well , " he said casually as he greeted me , " I could net attend your recital tonight because my class was so late . I could not get there . " I knew that was not true . There was no class at . nine o'clock in the evening , and , besides , my concert was in the hall next to the conservatory where he taught . I thought he was just out of sorts and not in the mood to hear my recital . But he repeated the same thing at my second recital , and , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened a little incident : that explained the attitude of both Safonoff and the audience . One evening a lady came to see me in the artists ' room . As she approached , I recognized her , and she said , in Polish , before I could speak , " Ah , Mr. Puderewski , I never , never expected to see you again . What a joy for me ! What a happiness ! " and she cried and cried , talking excitedly all the time in Polish . She was one of my companions and fellow students at the conservatory in Warsaw , studying the violin when I was there as a boy , and I played once , in a concert for students , a sonata , with her . I had not seen her for more than twenty years , and she was then married to a judge very far away from Moscow . She had made a hard three days ' journey just to hear me play again . Safonoff and another gentleman , a trustee of the conservatory , were standing next to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Oh , look at those Poles ! Hear them chattering together ! It is always like that ! " he went on contemptuously . " Always . Wherever they are , they insist upon jabbering that awful Polish language ! What a nuisance ! " He said all this with an expression of great hatred . Instantly , I turned and faced him , and after a long look I said , in perfect Russian , " You would , perhaps , sir , prefer to listen to us speaking in Yiddish ? " The Russian tour was full of such disagreeable moments , and several of them involved Safonoff . But the most characteristic thing happened at my last appearance , when I had again to play for the benefit of the widows and orphans of professors of the conservatory . It was in the small hall of the conservatory , holding , perhaps , a thousand people . It was full , and we appeared on the platform  --  myself , the violinist and the ' cellist . The moment I appeared , the hissing began , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " What does it mean ? " The violinist answered , " I have never seen or heard anything like it in my life , and I can not understand it . It is an outrage . " Well , the hissing increased , and then I said , " What shall I do now ? This is outrageous . It must he stopped . " .11 Call for the Police At that moment Safonoff appeared as usual in his shabby little coat , and I began speaking in Russian . I presume they did not even believe I could speak Russian . But I instantly addressed them in good Russian , and I said in a loud voice , still standing on the platform , " Mr. Safonoff , I can not play in this hail . It is quite impossible . " " But why ? Why not ? " " Did you not hear that hissing ? " " Oh , " he said , " do not pay any attention to that . " " But I have to pay attention to what the public does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play unless you send for police officers and put order into your house . " " What ? " he cried . " You do not mean that , surely . Y ou re not serious , " Yes , I do mean it , and if you do not do it , I shall do it and stay hero and wait for the policemen . If they do not appear , I shall put my coat on and go to the hotel , and if any newspaper correspondents ask me why , I shall tell them the truth : ' Because at your conservatory 1 have been hissed for the first time in my life . While attempting to play for the benefit of the widows and orphans of former professors of this same conservatory , have been hissed off the stage . ' " " You wo n't do that ! " he shouted . " It would disgrace me ! Kill me I Kill me ! " THE SRTURDAY EVENING POST " No , it would not kill you , but it would be very unpleasant for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , back and forth , and it ended by his finally sending for the police . Well , the policemen came  --  several of them . Then I went back again , quite alone , to the platform . The policemen saluted when I appeared , and said , " We are here , sir . " They stood for a few moments at attention and the house became perfectly quiet . Then I played . The audience was wonderful , I must say . You see , it was not the whole audience that had made this demonstration ; it was the usual minority  --  the several cowardly men who did not dare show their hostility against use except in a crowd . It is always so . Rowdyism at a Price Then Safonoff , just as though nothing had happened , invited me most affectionately to supper , and , of course , I went . There was no way out of it . Poor Safonoff got drunk , as usual . Our other companion , the ' cellist , was also in a pitiable condition . We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not remember how many bottles the ' cellist drank ; so many that I completely lost count . I only remember that the last bottle was half champagne and hall ' cognac , and he wanted me  --  in fact , implored me  --  to drink that poison . In his condition , of course , I accepted , but threw it over my shouder , and he was never the wiser  --  poor chap . In all this revel , Safonoff led . In fact , it was he who had the great idea of mia.Mg champagne with cognac . What a fellow he was , It was all very merry , and he never oven mentioned the incidents of the evening . Never . Everything was completely forgotten  --  and all was well . We remained there in that restaurant until six o'clock in the morning , doing nothing but talking nonsense and drinking . I , of course , was as sober as I am now . I only took what was convenient to me . The rest I threw away , but no one noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long story about Safonoff ; and , amusing as it is in spots , it has a deeply tragic side . There is still one thing that I must add , a little tribute , a few words more about Safonoff as a conductor and a man . In spite of long nights of drinking , he was at the first hour of the morning always at his desk as director of the conservatory . He was always there on the spot the first of all . He never failed . Extraordinary fidelity , energy and a great sense of duty and responsibility were his . But he killed himself . This man of iron with nerves of steel brought about his own destruction . Poor Safonoff I During my stay in Moscow I stopped at the Hotel Metropole . It was very full , of course  --  all in the full swing of the carnival celebration , day and night . I inquired if I might have a private room . The proprietor said , " Why , certainly , Mr. Paderewski . We will let you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very graciously , " a room with a piano in it too . " " Oh , " I cried in horror , " my dear sir , I have just run away from the piano ! I do not want a room with a piano in it  --  certainly not ! " " Well , " he laughed jovially , " you need not mind this piano . My piano will not disturb you . " So he then led me to the private room . It was a beautiful room with a fine upright piano . March bs. ' 9.37 I said , " What kind of piano is it ? I must see . " So I opened it and tried a note . No response . Then another note , No response . Then still another two or three notes . Not a sound . The piano was absolutely dumb , useless . A few minutes later he returned to take my order , and I said , " Please tell me your reason for having this piano here . I am curious . " " Piano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Paderewski , that is not a piano . That is a gold mine ! " " Why , what do you mean ? " I asked . " I will tell you , " be answered , lowering his voice and speaking in the greatest . confidence . " Perhaps you do not know our Moscow merchants , and their young sons in particular . They are very wild , and they are tremendously rich , too , these people , and do not know what to do with their money . When they get drunk , they become very violent ; they will do anything . First of all , they try to break everything that is breakable  --  plates , glasses , bottles , chairs , tables , mirrors  --  everything in the room is broken . Then when they can not break anything more , they order champagne in great quantities and pour that champagne into the piano . Yes , Mr. Paderewski , they pour practically all the champagne into the piano . Then , of course , they ask for the bill and , naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then I make an extra charge  --  a very large charge , sir -- for the destruction of my beautiful piano . So , you see , I am quite right in saying my piano is a gold mine . " Life was very extravagant in Russia , and everything was very complex , but interesting . But the people seemed to me like deaf-and-dumb people . They were afraid . You never heard them talking in the streets as in other countries ; they were in constant fear of the police . Such was the whole aspect of the country . Everyone was afraid of his own shadow , even in carnival time . After the Russian tour , I went to England , where I was to give a few concerts , and then home , for I had now a place to go after these great concert seasons  --  a place of repose , my own house . Two years before , in 1897 , I had bought this place , Riond-Bosson , at Morges , in Switzerland , and it filled and satisfied a deep and long-felt want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own that 1 could keep . The other properties , as you will remember , were sold almost as quickly as they were bought . But this was different ; this house became a home at once , and so it has remained . A Manager of Little Faith My poor son was very happy here . It appealed to him from the first .. As he was an invalid , unable to walk , his life here was easily managed , and this great room , opening out onto the terrace as it does , with its view of Lake Geneva and Mt . Blanc , flooded with sunshine and beauty , was a favorite spot with him . It was'in the spring of 1899 that a great change began in my life . I was married for the second time . I married Mme. Helena . Oorska , a highly accomplished lady and a devoted friend . We were married in Warsaw in May and returned to Riond-Bosson , my beloved home at Mamas . Late that same year I went again to America  --  and this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not , only covering the whole of the United States , but even going as far as Mexico . It was ( continued on Peg . 108 ) ( Continued from P.se 1013. just a regular and successful tour , Like so many , many others that I have to be thankful for . The only unusual thing that happened was in San Francisco . My concerts were booked by a local manager who was a very nice man , but rather peculiar . When I arrived in San Francisco from Mexico , I found my concerts advertised so modestly , so humbly , as to give the impression that either the tickets were all sold , and the manager did not want to make the newspapers richer through advertising , or that be had no faith in my success . On reading more closely , I noticed that , indeed , his faith in my possibility of achieving a success was absolutely nil , because he had reduced the tickets to half my usual price . I immediately asked the manager to come and see me . He preceded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife . When he appeared , upon my question as to why he did such a thing , he said , " Well , I did it in order to protect you and to safeguard my own interests as well . " " How do you mean , to protect my interests and to safeguard your own , when you reduce all the prices one-half ? Why ? " " Because , " he explained ? " because this is your second visit to San Francisco , remember , and in my entire theatrical experience I have never yet seen anyone able to repeat a success . " Well , I was speechless in the face of such stupidity . You know what an impression it makes on the public when they see that an artist , whom , a few years before , they paid four or five dollars to hear , can now he heard for two dollars . It was not so much the question of my material interests , but it was the question of my dignity . I protested decidedly , but it was too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold and we could not then raise the price . The house was ? inly half full , naturally . - After the concert , the manager hurried back to the dressing room , " You see , " he cried , " you did not fill the I hall ! It . was just as I said ! If we had asked your former prices , you would probably have had only a quarter of the hall filled . I told you so  --  I warned you ! ? Strangely enough , he seemed quite happy about it , even though it was his loss as well as mine . I saw that he was hopeless , no use arguing , and so I let it all pass . I will only add that upon my return to San Francisco several years afterward , under a different manager , I played to sold-out houses . Piano Concert-50 Per Cent Off In this connection , I must tell you another amusing experience . The only time I canceled a concert  --  two , in fact  --  when not forced to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willfully canceled these particular concerts . It was in England , in Torquay and in Plymouth , which are near each other . I had played there before , and several times after , but on that particular occasion the management of both concerts was given to a local agent , who applied for it . My representative in London then was Mr. Adlington , who was a good friend of mine . He was a musician himself and a good piano teacher , After retiring , he wanted something to do and had bought the rights of representing me from Daniel Mayer . He was not then experienced in tho managerial business and he trusted the local man who applied for the privilege Marsh 13,19W Of handling these two recitals . He did not know that in those email places there are competitions , rivalries and all kinds of little conflicts between the local people . When I arrived at the hotel in Torquay , I looked at the announcement as to the hour , and  --  well , I could hardly believe my eyes . The announcement read , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so on . And then went on in still larger letters : &IR.; MOON 'S PRICES FOR THIS CELEBRATED PIANIST ARE BUT 77 . ? ILF MS FORMER PRICES I was simply aghast . I sent my secretary at once to Mr. Moon and said that I could not at all understand the advertisement , and that I would not , under any circumstances , appear . I was canceling the concert .. And I did . Two piano makers on whose instruments I had never played , and would never play , used this as an excuse to launch a terrible campaign against me in the London newspapers , and the local manager threatened a lawsuit , but nothing came of either . The public understood . Dangerous Moments Oh , yes , there have been several conspiracies against me , several attacks on me , but they belong in my political life much later on . As an artist , though , I once had a dangerous moment while playing in the little town of Santa Cruz , California . The local opera house was full and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd and not the concert , climbed to the roof of the theater , where there were some heavy iron bars , . . . I do not know how it happened . It was not done intentionally , I am sure , but an iron bar crashed through an open skylight and hit the edge of the piano with tremendous force . Just a few inches nearer and it would have killed me at once . The audience jumped to its feet. , but seeing that I went on playing , they thought all was well . They did not realize how close death had come . Another accident , which proved to be not an accident at all but simply a fear on my part , is such a characteristic story of the West that it is worth telling . It happened in Dallas , Texas , where there was a great gathering of Confederate veterans  --  an enormous meeting , many thousands of them . The city of Dallas built a special hall for that occasion . It was an enormous wooden hall and held about 7000 people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a concert there . I had to take a special train from Chicago to reach the place in time , and , to my amazement , I found the hall was not yet finished . Everything was in a state of wild confusion . Wood , shavings and sawdust covered everything , and everywhere the workmen were carelessly dropping cigar and pipe ashes into the shavings . I was terrified at the sight . Fire seemed inevitable . " How can I play here , " I thought , " under such conditions ? " I was really convinced that there would be a terrific fire . I was so convinced of disaster that I gave my faithful Marcel , who was with mo , directions just what to do . My wife , who was also there , was to be his first thought . I would manage for myself . There was a kind of veranda on bath sides of the hall , where the old soldiers walked about and where beds were prepared for them to sleep in at night . The veterans , smoking constantly , roamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other days , who had fallen asleep in the aisles . My crashing Chopin chords had awakened them , apparently , and they mistook me for a military band . Still half asleep , memories of the old days came back to them , and they sprang to their feet and began shouting their battle cries . It lasted only a minute or two , but it was an eternity to me , although I kept on playing . So I finished the recital , and with great satisfaction , for that was an extremely enthusiastic audience , and remained for a long time after the concert , asking for more . An interesting and vivid experience that could only happen in the America of many years ago .
