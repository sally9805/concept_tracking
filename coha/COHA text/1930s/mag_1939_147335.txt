A mighty man of God was the Reverend Samuel Moody. * From 1698 until his death in 1747 , his warnings of hell fire kept the fireless meeting house at York Village , Maine , warm on even the coldest Sundays . Generous to a fault , he once gave away his wife 's only pair of shoes . Sturdy , he declined a salary , lived on " faith in his Divine Master " supplemented by the voluntary gifts of his flock . Paternal , he was called Father Moody , an appellation rare among Congregationalists . Intolerant as his era , he took along an ax when at 70 he sailed as chaplain of the 1745 expedition against Louisbourg , smashed the altars and images in that French fortress . <P> Garbed in flowing gown , full-fashioned wig , black skullcap and white neckerchief , " Father Moody " will appear this Sunday at the meeting house built the year he died . As of yore , his congregation will be drummed to meeting , the tithing man will tickle the drowsy with a rod tipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the psalms and lead the singing with a pitch pipe . The sermon will be " The Doleful State of the Damned , " which Samuel Moody first preached on August 21 , 1710 . He will pray that Queen Anne 's reign continue happy and glorious , " that this place and all other places be not bothered by Indians during the coming week . " <P> Impersonator of Father Moody will be York Village 's present Congregational pastor , the Rev. Walter H. Millinger . Earnest , antiquarian Parson Millinger held his first Father Moody Sunday in 1936 after running across his predecessor 's fiery sermon . The idea has spread ; now all Maine is digging up old sermons , redelivering them with period fixings . But even Pastor Millinger has yet to re-enact one custom of Father Moody 's time : those who did not spend Sunday in church spent Monday in the stocks . <P> <P> * Ancestor of the famed 19th-Century evangelist and hymn-writer , Dwight Moody .                  @ @ @
