Etymologists have long recognized the difference between U. S. and British English , but it was a layman , Henry Louis Mencken ( The American Language ) , who first popularized the idea that U. S. citizens speak a tongue of their own . Eleven years ago the University of Chicago asked slight , bearded Professor Sir William Alexander Craigie , since 1901 co-editor of the Oxford English Dictionary , to collect in definitive form the words that have meanings and currency peculiar to the U. S. Last week in Chicago appeared the first section , A-to-Baggage , of his long-awaited Dictionary of American English on Historical Principles* When complete the Dictionary will be as bulky as a Webster 's Unabridged , will sell for $80 . <P> Sir William decided that to be admitted a word must have originated in the U. S. , or disappeared in England since it arrived in the U. S. , or changed its meaning since immigration from England . A candidate must have been in use before 1900 . This ruled out slang+ since Sir William found : " Slang and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulness only in separate dictionaries . " <P> Although A-to-Baggage , as the editors point out , is composed chiefly of abstract words , it contains many U. S. technical coinages like airbrake , airline , automobile , autobus , autocar , autotruck . Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes thought up the word anaesthetic in 1846 . Appendicitis was introduced by another U. S. physician , Reginald Heber Fitz , 40 years later . Alumnus was taken directly from Latin about 1696 , and in 1882 Doglover Albert Payson Terhune 's mother , Essayist " Marion Harland , " first used alumnae . Politics produced Abolitionist , anti-liquor , anti-saloon , anti-imperialist . From the Southwestern border filtered Spanish words like adobe , alfalfa , arroyo . Also listed as Spanish in origin , on H. L. Mencken 's authority , is the U. S. poker term ante . <P> " American inventiveness , coupled with the strange and rich conditions which faced pioneers on the frontier , " explains Lexicographer Craigie , accounts for the U. S. habit of twisting familiar English words into new meanings . Inventive John Adams first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Washington introduced administration in its U. S. political sense in his 1796 Farewell Address , first used average as a verb , first used the term back country . Since then back has been firmly imbedded as an adjective in such U. S. phrases as back taxes , back pay , back number , back talk , backhouse . Likewise inventive was Mark Twain who introduced far along and well along , meaning advanced . The phrase get along appeared in 1830 , awful in the sense of " unpleasant " in 1828 . <P> For most of their source material the editors relied on second-rate writers , extinct magazines like the Southern Literary Messenger , the Lowell Magazine , the early Atlantic Monthly , Harper 's , Scribner 's , The Congressional Record . Writers like Hawthorne . Emerson , and Thoreau , Sir William observes , were " too English " to contribute much to his compendium .
