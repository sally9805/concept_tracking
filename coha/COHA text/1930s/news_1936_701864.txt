txt When the New Jersey Legislature convenes tomorrow night to take up the problem of relief taxation it will be greeted by hundreds , perhaps thousands , of the unemployed . Word received here by the leaders of the Worke.s Alliance , which for six days has been conducting a mock Assembly in the State House , indicate that perhaps 5,000 are coming from Camden and South Jersey points alone . William Arbridge , secretary-treasurer of the State organization of the unemployed , said tonight that merchants , worried over the failure of State relief , truck owners on WPA projects and many individuals had promised automobiles for the use of this mass lobby . Other contingents have been promised from Newark and other cities in Essex County , Paterson , Passaic and North Jersey points . To meet this influx the State House authorities have arranged to have a large contingent a State police on hand to keep order . Immediate Action Unlikely No one knows how many will arrive or how long they will remain , but every precaution is being taken to maintain order . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will vote new taxation tomorrow night . It was said at the State House today that the Republican majority in both houses planned to recess after meeting tomorrow night and to hold a conference on Tuesday morning . John C. Barbour , President of the Senate , intimated last Friday after a similar conference in Trenton that the municipalities would have to look after the needy until the Legislature had time to study thoroughly the problem , not only of relief for the needy , but for the already overburdened realty taxpayers . The " March to Trenton " is expected to include not only members of the Workers Alliance but employed workers as well , among them a group from the State teachers ' organization from towns where it has been proposed to close the schools to divert funds for the needy . A small group of Princeton students also is expected . Look for No Disorder The present occupants of the State Assembly Chamber did not appear to be disturbed over the prospects facing them . They look for no disturbance ; they are prepared to " recess " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their seats to them and then either go into the galleries or ask for " the I privilege of the floor . " " That would be according to timehonored precedent in this State , " John Spain Jr. , " Speaker " of the group , said . " Like any other lobbyist who wants to get something done , we expect to be honored with a place on the floor , where we can lobby for this relief legislation . " To aid in handling the crowd , Spain and his associates expect to send out their own speakers to make addresses . " We will allow no others to come in if we can help it , " he said . " We want no political speeches , Socialist , Communist or anything else . " Religious services beginning with a prayer for strength to carry on during the hard days ahead marked the opening of the Sunday morning session of this " assembly of the unemployed . " Standing silently and reverently this group of worn and weary men and women heard the Rev. R. D. Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time may be hastened when the unemployed shall find security again . It was not a very imposing audience that faced the tall young rector , an active leader in Trenton 's social service affairs , when he stepped to the rostrum this morning . They had made some preparations to receive him . Papers and cigarette stubs still littered the floor , but the men had shaved , their womenfolk had brought them clean shirts from home and the few children had their faces scrubbed until they shone . " Assembly " Called to Order " Speaker " Spain called the " assembly " to order , asked the sergeant-at-arms to gather in " mem13ers " from the corridor and then turned the meeting over to the ree1 tor . " I will ask that there be no smoking and that you rise for the prayers , " he said . " Let us pray . " A sleeping Negro on a window sill was nudged into wakefulness . Mothers put restraining hands on wriggling youngsters and the congregation rose . " Almighty God , who sent Thy Son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice among men , we remember before Thee this morning the deprivations and sufferings of the unemployed everywhere , " he said , " but especially are we mindful today of the critical need of those in this State . " Awaken , 0 Lord , the hearts and consciences of those we have chosen to govern us to a full sense of their responsibility and to make public service and human needs their first consideration . " Awaken their minds to a full understanding of the problem . Inspire them with the vision to see the just and adequate solutions and grant them the courage and the strength to effect it . " Awaken the hearts of those of us who are secure and comfortable to be fully alive to the critical situation of the millions of their brothers and sisters . " Break down all smugness and self-complacency and lead all men to be more indignant of injustice , more indignant of oppression and deprivation . " Build up , 0 Lord , in the hearts of Thy people an unshakable determination to build a world of brotherhood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , where no man goes without the necessities of life , where no man wanting to work and support his family is unable to do so . " Mr. Smith then read from the Gospel of St. Luke the story of the good Samaritan . " I read you this story as a parable of the unemployment situation , " he said . " Twelve or fifteen million travelers have been robbed , beaten and left on the Jericho Road by a social system unable to give them jobs . We have the picture of those who passed by on the other side ? many thousands of our citizens . Many , I am ashamed to say of our rulers , unwilling to see the man who had fallen among robbers . And we have the Samaritans  --  you  --  and the others who are fighting for each other struck down by a system unable to give men the opportunities of the abundant life . " Some people , he said , criticized the church for becoming involved in labor 's struggle for security . He added : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed the trade of carpenter for years , and who always stood on the side of the working man . " New Economic System Urged Relief , Mr. Smith said , was not the final solution of the problem . " That is a social order and an economic and business order built on the principle of production for use and not for profit and greed , " he continued . " Wealth must be distributed among all who produce it , not concentrated in the hands of the few . " He then congratulated his listeners on " the courage , the orderlines , the maturity , tact and intelligence you have shown . " Church bells were ringing for the more conventional services in the city as the young rector hurried from the State House . After he left the body went into " session again " and quickly passed a number of bills , among them one calling for a $3,000,000 appropriation for " soap and water to cleanse the State government " and another appropriation for the unemployed the daylight saved by daylight saving . Tonight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembly settled down early to rest . The leaders feel nothing more can be accomplished and are concerned now only with ways and means of exerting pressure on the real Legislature to grant immediate relief . Seventy-five , churches , members of the Trenton Council of Churches , announced late today that their congregation had adopted a resolution condemning the Legislature for its lack of action in making adequate provisions for relief .
