Mrs. Sadlier 's Champions <P> With his thumbs in his shiny belt last week Constable Arthur Jex of Worthing , Sussex stomached up to a suspicious looking character who gave the name of Leonard Rowland Hill . <P> " Now hold on , now , hold on . " said Constable Jex . " There are a few things you and I ought to have a little talk about . " <P> Within the past week two serious burglaries had taken place in the neighborhood and things seemed to point to Leonard Rowland Hill . But shifty Leonard was in no mood for even a little talk . Suddenly he pulled a pistol from his pocket , shot and wounded Constable Arthur Jex . <P> All Britain was as shocked as the constable . Did Sussex nurture another Dillinger ? Was Worthing to be the Chicago of the Downs ? The County armed . Huge Webley &; Scott revolvers were issued to the local police , a fact that produced eight column headlines in the London Press .

Unasked , Sir Oswald Mosley 's Black Shirts joined the man hunt . <P> One midnight somebody remembered that Mrs. Sadlier , over across the Downs , kept bloodhounds . Mrs. Sadlier is the wife of Author-Publisher Michael Sadlier ( Constable &; Co. ) whose writings range from a commentary and bibliography of Anthony Trollope to a monograph on the history of publishers ' bindings . He changed his name from Sadler to Sadlier to avoid confusion with his equally distinguished father , Sir Michael Ernest Sadler , Master of University College , Oxford . <P> Mrs. Sadlier not only breeds bloodhounds but champion ones which she herself trains . Because of her husband 's interest in Trollope her kennel name is Barchester . At 3 a. m. police rolled up to the door and routed her out of bed . Mrs. Sadlier is a sportswoman born ; her father , Canon Albert Darell Tupper-Carey , has the sporting post of Chaplain at Monte Carlo . Shaking the sleep from her eyes she called : <P> " A man hunt ?

Champion Sarah suddenly threw up her head and howled . Almost instantly both hounds were scrambling on the trail . Red-faced , hot and excited . Mrs. Sadlier pounded along , her champions nearly pulling her arms out . Up a hill they raced , through copses and hedges and across fields . Dawn was just breaking . <P> Two miles from Myrtle Grove Champion Huntsman ceased baying and threw back his head , trembling . Champion Sarah pulled away to the left . <P> " I say !
