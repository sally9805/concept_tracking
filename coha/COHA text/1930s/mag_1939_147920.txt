Home Secretary Sir John Anderson , a tight-lipped disciplinarian with a hard but twinkling eye , perfectly appreciates that the moderate whoopee requirements of Tommy Atkins on leave are all but irrepressible . Last week Sir John continued to maintain a firm laissez-faire stand toward London night life despite a great twittering of complaint from the shires that today night club " harpies and hussies " are again preying on the morals and emptying the purses of apple-cheeked subalterns as in 1914-18 . <P> In flats deserted by wartime vacus from London , new clubs open almost every night . Sir John keeps an eye on them by means of occasional Scotland Yard " raids . " The polite British inspectors merely take down the names of patrons in little notebooks , but do not close the joint . In the House of Commons there is mildly derisive laughter whenever His Majesty 's Government is questioned about " blackout morals " and " harpy clubs " by such anxious moralists as Manchester Conservative E. L. Fleming , M. P. " I am worried about wicked women , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men should be fit , not unfit . " <P> Scenting news . Fleet Street has sent reporters to interview London harpies , some of whom seem to have been upset by the twittering from the shires . At the Cabaret Club , the London Daily Express found " a great big , graceful , healthy girl , " Miss Eunice Allman , who explained that her work consists in " soothing bruised egos , " begged , " If you 're writing about us , do n't make us out to be the scum of the earth . We 're not so bad . " In general the press survey went far toward confirming Sir John Anderson 's evident feeling that there can be nothing very awful about even such ostentatiously " lowlife " dives as the Nut Club in Greek Street so long as its regular patrons continue to include such people as Mrs. Anthony Eden . <P> Because of Britain 's liquor-curbing early closing laws , extra-late London night life has for years been an affair of " bottle parties " - i.e. , the guests either bring their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or they leave advance orders at the club to have it sent in from wholesalers and " stored " until the guest arrives . The cheapest wine comes to $4 per bottle by this system , the cheapest whiskey $5 . In the World War II bottle party boom , Mayfair clubs are now offering elaborate and sexy floor shows ( see cuts ) , causing some wonder at London 's Picture Post 's observation that " the atmosphere is rather like that of a family party where the younger girls are in tearing spirits and occasionally do the splits or snatch a cigar from uncle 's mouth . Everyone is out to be as naughty as possible , but it is a very schoolboyish kind of naughtiness without much sign of the sinister or the vicious . "
