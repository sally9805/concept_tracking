 | " Gentlemen , you have seen the body of Bond Grayson and had it identified by several reputable witnesses . I will , with your permission , vary the usual method of conducting an inquiry into the cause of death by not producing the body in this court , out of respect for the feelings of the many persons here present who knew and admired him . It lies , however , in an adjoining room , and can be seen again if necessary . " Then he studied the papers in his hand . " I will begin the inquiry by telling of my own knowledge of the case . . . . I was called night before last , which was Wednesday , July the nineteenth , to come at once to the Grayson Building , located at the southeast corner of Hayward and Cresson Streets . I arrived there at eleven-twenty and found the deceased lying dead in his office . The time of death I placed approximately an hour to an hour and a half previously , as well as I could judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulletwound on the head , which you will hear described later . This revolver " ? he held up a blue-steel pistol ? " lay on the floor of the office . You have seen the office , gentlemen , and will therefore recognize this picture . " Here he unrolled an enlarged photograph of room 719 , showing the view from the corridor door , and hung it from a nail in the wall . " There is the desk , gentlemen , on which the body of the deceased lay . " Then he consulted his papers and said : " I now call Dr. Trueman Appleby to the stand . " A tall man near me , with a neat bandage on one of his hands , rose and made his way forward . He was of  | less than middle age , dark with sunburn and quite goodlooking . He pushed through the closely-spaced chairs with the ease of an athlete and sat facing the jury with calm self-assurance . " Dr. Appleby , " said the coroner , " you were the personal physician of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's closely-cropped and wellshaped head nodded once in affirmation . " You made an examination of his body shortly after his death ? " " I did . " " Will you tell us of your findings , please ? " Appleby nodded again . " I was called that night at my home and left immediately , after making excuses to a guest who had been with me throughout the evening . I arrived to find Mr. Grayson shot dead at his desk . There was a bullet-wound at the top of the head , about an inch and a half to the left of the center . The bullet had not entered the skull , but had torn the scalp severely , caused a complete fracture , and had then glanced off . It was found later , I think , embedded in the window-sill behind him . " " In your opinion , Doctor , was the wound a fatal one ? " " In my opinion , considering the circumstances , it was . Ordinarily such a wound would not necessarily be fatal , but in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it was  --  I have no doubt in saying that death was instantaneous after the shot . " Will you explain that , please ? " asked the coroner .  | " The only explanation required is to say that Mr. Grayson was , and had been for some time , in a critical stage of heart disease , and was out of bed only under my protest . " " If he was so ill , Doctor , how could he work as he seemed to have been doing just before his death ? " Appleby smiled and waved an expressive , competent hand . " I have often wondered about just that , " he said . " The only answer seems to be that Mr. Grayson would never permit himself to realize how dangerously ill he was . Men who are used to enjoying good health are often that way . " The coroner paused to study his memoranda . " Is there anything else you would like to add , Doctor ? " he said at last . " Yes , " was the reply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my last examination of Mr. Grayson took place about half-past three in the afternoon of the day he died . I found him no better than usual and ordered him to bed , at once . As usual , he did not obey me , and I left him at quarter to four . That was the last I saw of him . " He meant to give out the idea , I think , that if he had been obeyed in his instructions , my uncle would still be alive . But what was the good of such hind-sight ? Dr. Appleby then was excused and returned quietly , and yet impressively , to his seat . 3 . Hollis Fenby fussed with his papers and paused be-  | fore calling the next witness . In the interval I glanced curiously about the room , and then suddenly held my eyes still on a vision . She was crying softly , holding a tiny handkerchief first to one eye and then to the other , and yet she was a vision in spite of that . She sat a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tantalizing glimpse of tilted nose and firm mouth hidden behind the wealth of brown wavy hair that her small hat did not pretend to confine . She sat erect , watching the proceedings with grave interest . Beside her , sometimes speaking to her in an undertone , was an elderly and white-haired man whose main purpose seemed to be in making a complete record of the testimony in shorthand . I could see his thick stenographer 's notebook and the scrawls upon it . I whispered to Marsh : " Do you know the girl over there ? Who is she ? " Marsh followed my glance . " That 's Harry  --  Harriett Fleming , " he said . " Your uncle 's secretary . Splendid girl . " I agreed with him . " And the man beside her ? " " Sam Peterson . Your uncle 's right hand man in the office . Knows more about his affairs than he did himself , I think . He 's a shrewd old bird . Probably worth three times the salary he gets , and perfectly content as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thorough as he wants . " The coroner here called John Blann to the stand . A large and slouchy man rose from a front-row chair and  | walked forward . He was intensely ill at ease , and continually twisted the old felt hat in his hands into all manner of shapes . He blinked dully as he awaited the coroner 's first question , which was a request to tell fully of his discovery of the body . " Well , " he said , " it was like this . I come on duty at seven o'clock , like I always do , and I was makin ' my second round right after eleven . I got down to the seventh floor , see , and punched my clock right on time . Then " " Just a minute , please , " said Fenby . " Will you tell the jury what you mean by punching the clock ' ? " Blann blinked as if astounded that anyone should not know this . " It 's  --  it 's , well , that 's just what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a clock on every floor and you 've got a key to turn it with . You do it every hour , startin ' with ten o'clock , and workin ' down from the top o ' the house . And if you 're more than fifteen minutes late a man comes from th ' A. D. T. to see what 's wrong . But I was n't late that night , no , sir . I ai n't been late since New Year 's eve . You ask Mr. Peterson if that ai n't " Never mind , " interposed the coroner . " Just go ahead with your story , please . " " Well , I punched the clock  --  that 's on the east end o ' the building  --  and then walked back to the stairs . I saw Mr. Grayson 's light was on and the door open , so I looked in , just like I 'm supposed t ' do , and I seen him lyin ' there on his desk with the safe open behind him . I went in but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t ' the  | inside door and took a good look and come on out and used Miss Harriett 's telephone there t ' phone for the cops . And then I waited in the hall until they come . " " Did you see anything on the floor when you went in ? " Blann nodded emphatically . " There was a gun on the floor . " " Where on the floor ? " The witness seemed at a loss as to how to describe the location . Then he simplified his problem by putting his finger on the large photograph . He pointed to about the center of the outer office . " Right there , " he said . Fenby asked : " What was the precise time of your discovery ? " " You mean , when did I find the boss ? " " Yes . " " ' Bout eight minutes after eleven . Th ' A. D. T. man ' 1l tell you that 's when I punched in . " " Can you tell us , Mr. Blann , just who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or shortly before ? " The watchman had evidently rehearsed the answer to this question , because it came out in a rush : " There was three people in the place after ten o'clock . Mr. Barton on the tenth floor , Mr. Spurrier on the ninth and Mr. Flick on the fourth . The others all left ahead o ' ten o'clock . The night slips 'll show all that . " " Who has charge of making out the night slips ? " " Bill Johnson , the elevator man . "  | " As far as you know , Mr. Blann , was the entrance to the building left unguarded at any time after you came on duty ? " Blann lied terrifically with only a slight blink . " No , sir , " he said . " The door was covered the whole time . " " How was it covered when you went upstairs to make your round ? " " By lockin ' the door from the inside and keepin ' Bill Johnson there . " " And suppose Bill Johnson was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the key with him while he went , and anybody wantin ' to get in or out would have t ' wait until either him or me come along . " Fenby looked down at his notes . " On your first round , at ten o'clock , did you look into Mr. Grayson 's office ? " " Yes , sir . " " Will you tell us about that ? " " Well , I start my first round , see , at ten o'clock , and I 'm supposed t ' try all the doors t ' see if they 're locked after the charwomen leave . Bet you 'd be surprised if I told you how dumb them Polacks are , " he sniffed . " Leavin ' doors unlocked ai n't nothin ' t ' what they do sometimes . . . . Well , I always start at the top an ' work down , see ? And all the doors is O. K. except Mr. Barton 's and Mr. Spurrier 's , which I told you about . But when " " Wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? "  | " Well , Mr. Barton was , I know . I looked in . I did n't look in Mr. Spurrier 's room , so I do n't know about him . " " All right . Go ahead . " " Well , when I come down t ' the seventh I see a light on in the boss 's office . The door was open , so I looked in an ' see the light 's comin ' from the inside room . The inside door was closed , but I could hear two people talkin ' . One was the boss an ' the other was I do n't know who . I did n't go in , but I left the door like it was and went on through the rest o ' the buildin ' . " " Was Mr. Flick in his office on the fourth floor when you got there ? " " I do n't know . The light was on but the door was locked , so I did n't look in . " The coroner asked : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blann considered , and then said , " No , sir . " " As far as you know , did anything unusual happen in the building before ten-thirty ? Did you hear or see anyone about who did n't belong there ? " The man swallowed hard at this second certain lie . " No , sir , " he said . " All right . Step down . " A juror cleared his throat and asked a question : " Mr. Coroner , may I ask the witness something ? " " Certainly . What is it ? " " I 'd like the witness to tell us how long he 's been working there at the building , and if he knows all the people who work there . "  | " A good question . Well , Blann ? " " Sure , I know everybody that stays late . Not the clerks and typewriter girls . Do n't know them because I never see them . " " And how long have you been there ? " " Eight years . " " Thank you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILLIAM JOHNSON , please , " said the coroner . I recognized the witness . He was the heavy , grayhaired man I had seen as I waited hidden on the stairs . He answered the routine questions nervously , emphasizing each reply with a quick jerk of the head . He had been on duty since seven o'clock ; had kept complete records of everyone who entered or left after that hour ; the facts given by the watchman were correct , as far as he knew ; the door was not unguarded at any time . At quarter after eleven he had heard a car pull up outside and saw some men come into the building ? three " dicks " and two policemen . One of the policemen stayed at the door and he took the others to the seventh floor and showed them where 719 was . That was the first he knew of anything wrong . Where were the night slips now ? The police had them . How long have you worked at the building ? Twelve or thirteen years . Anything else to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed that the coroner conferred frequently with a red-haired man who slouched in a near-by chair , and who never stopped chewing on gum or whatever it may have been . It seemed to me that the inquiry was more in this man 's  | hands than in the coroner 's ; although he never spoke aloud , never asked a question , I noticed that a snap of his fingers was a signal for the coroner to come to be whispered to , and to receive suggestions . At each such conference the coroner would nod as if in acquiescence . I asked Marsh if he knew the red-haired man . " Mattingly , from Headquarters , " said Marsh , tersely . " Good man . " " In charge of the investigation ? " " Complete charge , reporting direct to Commissioner Gaither by special orders . And he has the whole Detective Bureau to help him , if he wants it . This is a big case and Gaither means to get to the bottom of it as soon as possible . " " Mary Janowski ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plump , robust and frightened almost out of her skin , took the stand . She was eager to tell what she knew , but nothing of interest came forth . She gave an account of her activities very much as Marsh had told it to me . She had been unable to recognize the voice of the mysterious visitor in the inner office . She went downstairs at quarter to ten , leaving the door to 719 as she had found it . It was a hot night and she thought maybe Mr. Grayson wanted the door open for that reason . She reported to the head janitor that the cleaning of Mr. Grayson 's office had not been completed , and then went home . That was all she knew . She sighed audibly in relief as she was excused . " Samuel Peterson ! "  | The elderly man put aside his notebook and walked forward gravely . As he took the stand he nodded approvingly to the coroner , as if to say that he was entirely ready to do what he could to help . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection with Mr. Grayson ? " " I am  --  was  --  his bookkeeper . I have been in his employ for a great many years . " " You are familiar with his affairs ? " " With most of them , fully . With some of them , not at all . " " Why not with all ? Was there any reason for Mr. Grayson to keep some of his dealings to himself ? " The old fellow allowed Hollis Fenby to see clearly that his question was clumsily put by frowning in annoyance before replying . " Mr. Grayson , " he said slowly , " was a most unusual man , and if he chose to do unusual things I am sure I had no right to ask him why . " Fenby coughed and changed his approach : " Have you any opinion as to the reason behind Mr. Grayson 's death ? " " None whatever . " " Have you any knowledge that might lead the jury to an opinion ? " " No . " " When did you last see Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at which time I bade him good-bye and left the office for my home . "  | " As far as you know , did he seem nervous or apprehensive ? " " No . He was his usual self , except for the physical weakness he has suffered increasingly for several months . " " Why did he remain in his office that night ? " " I do n't know . He did not explain his reason to me . " " Was he in the habit of staying late ? " " Not at all . Generally he was gone by five-thirty or six . " " Was any correspondence received that day , or before , which might have caused him to stay ? Any request for a late appointment ? " " I know of nothing . " " Do you open all mail that comes to the office ? " " Yes , unless it is marked Personal . ' " " Did any personal mail come that day ? " " No . " " Do all telephone calls come to you first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Grayson 's secretary . No calls were ever put through to him unless the caller was known . " " Are you aware of any call that day which might have caused him to stay late ? " " No . " " Can you remember who called him that day ? " " There were only two incoming calls which went to him , as far as I know . One was from a tenant regarding renewal of a lease in the Grayson Building , and the other was from his physician . "  | The coroner paused for a glimpse at his notes and then went off on another tack : " Can you tell the jury if anything was missed from the office after Mr. Grayson 's death ? Anything stolen ? " Peterson looked at the jury and nodded . " I am not certain , " he said , " but I think it is quite possible that fifty thousand dollars in cash was taken from the safe . " 2 . This was something new to me . I asked Marsh , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised his eyebrows . " Do n't know a thing about it . Sam told us yesterday he thought nothing had been taken from the safe . " Sam Peterson proceeded to explain . " Last Monday , " he said , " Mr. Grayson asked me to get him fifty one-thousand dollar notes and fifty one-dollar notes . He wanted all new ones , if I could get them , and the larger bills were to be of consecutive numbers . He wrote out his personal check for the whole amount . I did as he asked , and when I handed him the money he glanced at it and put it in a desk-drawer . He did not say what it was to be used for . " " Did you ask him ? " pressed the coroner . The old man smiled . " I never asked questions of Mr. Grayson . If he had wanted me to know what the money was for he would have told me . " " Why do you think it was stolen from the safe ? " " I 'm really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the money or not before he died , but if he  | did n't , he would have kept it in the safe . And it was n't there Wednesday night . " " Did you make a notation of the serial numbers ? " " Oh , yes . I gave a copy of the numbers to Lieutenant Mattingly . " The coroner then conferred with the lieutenant briefly and turned back . " Is there anything else you would like to add , Mr. Peterson ? " " No . " " Excused . Thank you . . . . Miss Harriett Fleming , please . " My brown-haired vision made her way to the stand quietly and gracefully , despite her evident agitation . I then saw her face clearly for the first time ; saw her smile doubtfully at the coroner and the jury . She was charming . For the most part her story was simply to reiterate what Sam Peterson had said concerning office procedure , and to indicate that she was completely at sea as to any rhyme or reason behind the crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forthcoming . The coroner had asked , almost as a matter of form , if there was anything more she wished to say . " Yes , " she replied firmly , " there is . " " Will you tell the jury , please ? " She turned to look toward the dozen men behind the rail , and then became a shade doubtful . " I 'm not sure , " she said , " that it means anything , but when I went back at five-thirty , I  | The coroner interrupted quickly : " But you 've said nothing about going back to the office , Miss Fleming . " " I know , " she said with spirit . " I 'm telling you now . " " Why have n't you said something about it before ? " " If you mean before the inquest , I suppose it was because I  --  I was n't sure I ought to . If you mean here at the inquest , it was because I have n't had a chance . " " Very well , Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can . " " I will . . . When I left the office a little after five o'clock , Mr. Grayson was sitting in his room staring out of the window . It was so unusual to see him idle that I asked him if he felt well . He smiled and said he was all right , and waved his hand then as I said goodbye . I went downstairs and started to walk home , but for some reason I kept thinking of him , and wondering if he really was well enough to be left alone . You see , Dr. Appleby had told me about Mr. Grayson 's heart condition . " I suppose I am rather impulsive , because after I had walked three or four squares I stopped , turned and walked back again . On my return to the building I bought a cold bottle of ginger-ale for him . I knew he liked it . " He was in exactly the same position when I went in , sitting at his desk half-turned to the window and staring out . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private office . Then he became aware of me and jumped suddenly a$ if he had been startled , and quickly  | put his hand over something that lay on his desk-blotter . Then he recognized me and smiled a little . " What are you doing back in this hot office , young lady ? ' he asked me . " Worrying about you , ' I said , and bringing you a cold drink . ' " I appreciate the drink , ' he said , but not the worry . Why do you worry ? ' " You should n't be here , ' I said . You should be in bed , as Dr. Appleby says . ' " He laughed . Oh , him , ' he said . I believe he 's just as well pleased if I do n't do as he says . I think he 'd like to be rid of me . ' " Rubbish ! ' I said . What gave you that idea ? ' " He continued speaking as if he had n't heard me . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the way . I have n't accumulated a fortune without making enemies . I guess there are as many enemies , almost , as there are dollars . ' He sighed then and sipped his ginger-ale , and then looked up at me . Do you know , Miss Fleming , I often wonder if I really have a single friend . If I were to die tonight , ' he kept on , who would be sorry , except George Clark and Sam Peterson and yourself ? ' " I said nothing . I could n't . I felt too much like crying , all at once . He seemed to be so  --  so helpless . Then he sighed again heavily and finished the ginger-ale , all the time keeping one hand on the desk , covering something as if he did n't want me to see it . He said nothing more .  | " I did my best to cheer him up , but I do n't think I succeeded very well . After a while , about quarter to six , I left for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was the last I saw of him . " The room was oddly hushed as she finished ; there was not even the usual buzz of whispering as she prepared to leave the stand . The coroner seemed somewhat puzzled . He leaned over toward the red-haired man for instructions . Then he straightened up and asked one question : " Miss Fleming , did you see the object on his desk before he covered it with his hand ? " " Yes , I did . I forgot to tell you . It was a tiny pair of opera-glasses. "  | CHAPTER VII 1 . " WHY should he hide them from you ? " asked the coroner . " I 'm sure I do n't know , " said the girl . " Had you ever seen the opera-glasses before ? " " Never . " " Have you any opinion as to the possible use he might have had for them ? " " None at all . " " Do you think , " insisted Fenby , " that they might be connected with his death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and twisted her handkerchief in indecision . " I  --  I do n't think so . I ca n't imagine how . " Fenby looked toward the red-haired man and got a shake of the head for instructions . " That 's all , Miss Fleming , unless you have something more you 'd like to tell the jury . " She rose quickly and made her way hack to the side of Sam Peterson . I saw him pat her hand consolingly . Then he looked up as his name was called again . " Mr. Peterson , will you take the stand once more , please ? " " Certainly . "  | " Mr. Peterson , do you recall seeing the gold operaglasses mentioned by Miss Fleming ? " " No , never . " " That 's all , thank you . " There followed a lengthy conference between the coroner and his red-haired commanding officer . It was ended by Fenby 's call for Marsh to step up . He left me promptly and went forward with his brief-case in hand . " Mr. Marsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For some of his affairs , yes . " " Principally his personal business ? " " That 's right . " " Did you prepare his will ? " " No , I did not . Mr. Grayson himself made his last will , unknown to me , although I had prepared his previous one some months before . " " Are you familiar with the terms of his latest will ? " " Yes . I have a digest , of it here . It was found in his safe . " " Will you tell the jury about it , please ? " Marsh fumbled a bit with the straps of his brief-case , finally extracting a single sheet of paper . " The will , " he said , " was very simply drawn and is legally complete in every respect . It is not very long . There are moderate sums given outright , in appreciation of their services , to Mr. Peterson , Miss Fleming , George Clark , his house-servant , to the employees at the Grayson Building and to myself . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Community Fund , and a fund for the  | endowment of a scholarship in the School of Business and Economics at Johns Hopkins University . The remainder is left unconditionally to his nephew , Oliver Grayson , who is named co-executor with myself . " I could see the crowd turning to look at each other , wondering if this or that man were Oliver Grayson . I was glad to be unknown . I hate to be stared at . " Will you give the jury some idea of the size of the estate , Mr. Marsh ? " The lawyer hesitated as if he resented the question , but at last he said he had been led to believe by Mr. Grayson that the total was not far from seven million dollars . " And what is the total of the specific bequests ? " " Approximately one million . " " The nephew , then , will receive about six million dollars ? " Fenby seemed to roll the sum about his tongue succulently . " Yes . " " Is the nephew in this court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further outbreak of headturning , and a chorus of sibilant whispers . The coroner was compelled to pound on his table for order . " When was this will executed , Mr. Marsh ? " Marsh did not need to refer to his paper . " On July eighteenth last , " he said . " The day before he died . " 2 . Here the red-haired man snapped his fingers and spoke briefly to the coroner , who nodded obediently.  | " Was there any mention of Dr. Appleby in the will ? " None at all . " " Do you know why he should have been omitted , when it seems that all others who were in regular contact with Mr. Grayson were remembered ? " " No . As I said , Mr. Grayson did not consult me at all in preparing this will . " " Have you any knowledge that would lead you to think Mr. Grayson was expecting to be attacked ? " " Not the slightest . " " Thank you , Mr. Marsh . Step down . . . . Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There was no change whatever in the doctor 's assurance . He took the chair calmly and gazed complacently about the room while waiting for the further interrogation . " Dr. Appleby , is there any reason that you can think of for Mr. Grayson 's omission of your name in his will ? " Appleby smiled cheerily . " Yes , there is . He probably thought the fees I charged him were sufficient to cover all obligations . " " Were they high ? " " Not too high , for a man of his wealth . And you must remember , too , that about a third of my time was devoted solely to him . " " Do you mind telling the jury approximately what your fees amounted to ? " " I do mind . But I 'll tell them anyway . In the year  | and a half I 've been attending Mr. Grayson he has paid me eight or nine thousand dollars altogether . " " I see . . . . Thank you , Doctor . " But Appleby was not ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You will note that I said he paid me that amount , but that was not the total of my bills to him . Mr. Grayson was of the opinion that he knew better what my services were worth than I , and invariably discounted my bills by ten to twenty per cent. , depending on the mood he was in . He said that since he was n't able to pick his doctor by competitive bidding , he might just as well knock off a little of my excess profit . I did not dispute the point . One never disputes with heart cases . " I enjoyed that . It was so like my uncle to do such a thing ; business was business , even where his own health was concerned . The coroner then had an afterthought : " In your visits to Mr. Grayson 's office , did you ever see the gold opera-glasses mentioned by Miss Flem-ing ? " " No , never . " " Thank you . That 's all . " But one of the jurors  --  the same one , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He rose and held Appleby with a question : " Will you tell us , Doctor , why Mr. Grayson told that girl he thought you 'd like to he rid of him ? " Appleby flushed and did not reply immediately , though he kept his poise admirably . Then he shrugged  | his shoulders in utter perplexity and waved one hand expressively . " I 'm sure I have n't the faintest idea , " he said at last , " but I 'd be inclined , offhand , to put it down to his state of mind at the time . He had been depressed and nervous for weeks , and imagined , I think , that no one cared whether he lived or died . He was simply including me in with everyone else . . . . As a matter of fact , I had a great deal to lose by his death . Six thousand dollars a year means a lot to me . . . . In hearing Miss Fleming repeat what he said about me , I 'm completely mystified , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the result of too much brooding and loneliness . Mr. Grayson was a very lonely man , for all his wealth . " I think Appleby realized his explanation was weak , despite the ease and composure with which he had given it , for he stood watching the juror as if he expected further interrogation . It came at once , while the coroner stood by doubtfully : " Just for the sake of the record , Doctor , will you tell us where you were at the time Mr. Grayson died ? " Appleby flushed again and swallowed hard . I felt sorry for him , and I think everyone else did also , except the persistent juror . But the reply came quickly . " I was at home all evening , " he said , " with my wife and a guest . The guest was Dr. Raymond Milholland , who is here now if you wish to question him . I went home with Dr. Milholland somewhere about four o'clock in the afternoon , and stayed there until the po-  | lice called me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . Does that answer your question satisfactorily ? " It seemed it did , for the juror sat down disappointedly . And the doctor , slightly ruffled but still composed , stepped down and went back to his seat in the audience . 3 . There was a short interval in which the coroner conferred again with the red-haired detective . Marsh took advantage of the pause to whisper to me . " Do n't be surprised if the inquest should end very soon , " he said . " Mattingly hinted to me yesterday that he would get it over with as quickly as possible , calling only enough witnesses to give the bare outline . All he wants is an unknown ' verdict . He was n't in favor of having an inquest at all  --  thinks it 's a waste of time . But Fenby took advantage of his authority and ordered it . Mattingly 's holding him down , though . You can see that . He 's itching to get to some real work . " " Think they 'll go into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know Mattingly would like to keep it off the record and out of the papers for a while . And the three tenants probably wo n't be called either . . . . Looks like Fenby is preparing to sum up now . " Marsh was right . The coroner seemed quite disappointed in having his show end so soon , but took his orders like a man and gave a short summation of the few facts that had been made public . He stressed the  | possibility of someone being in the building unknown to the watchman , despite his apparent vigilance , and pointed out that if one were desperate enough , it would not be difficult to leave the building by climbing down the outside stonework from the second story , or by jumping the fifteen feet to the sidewalk . He pointed out that there was no evidence whatsoever to indicate the guilt of any particular person , and ended by hinting rather broadly that there was but one verdict to be rendered . I dare say that if the persistent juror had not been squelched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a more complete proceeding , for he seemed thoroughly dissatisfied with the whole business . He rose meekly enough , however , with the other eleven , followed them through the door at the side of the room , and returned with them in a few minutes to glare about in disgust while the foreman said the expected words : " Murder by person or persons unknown . " That was all . We rose in a body , glad to stretch our legs , and moved in a body to the main door . I spoke to Marsh : " What now ? " " What would you suggest ? " " I 'd like to meet Mattingly if I could , and Sam Peterson and  --  Miss Fleming . " I believe that for a time I had completely forgotten the dangerous position I was in . I felt eager to assist in the investigation , if Mattingly would allow me.  | Marsh tugged at my arm , pulling me against the tide of the crowd . The lieutenant was replenishing his wad of gum thoughtfully , ignoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marsh as we approached . " Ask Miss Fleming to stick around , will you please ? " he said to the lawyer . Marsh caught her eye and beckoned meaningly . She stayed , and Sam Peterson stayed with her . " This is Oliver Grayson , Lieutenant , " said Marsh , turning back . " He 'd like to meet you . " " I 'd like to meet him , too . " He stared at me for an embarrassingly long moment before consenting to take my hand . Now that I saw him well he seemed totally unsuited to the job he had . His face was round and pudgy , with a complexion any girl would envy , and his light blue eyes were wide and innocent . His body was short , and his movements  --  except for the unceasing gum-chewing  --  were slow and methodical . I could not help but think of an undertaker 's assistant I had once known . If he reads this , I hope he realizes that I soon found out his appearance was no indication of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked me slowly . " Not a thing , " I lied . " Then why do you want to meet me ? " " For two reasons , " I said . " One is to get you to let me help if I can . The other is to find out from you how big a reward I should offer for information . "  | He chewed silently and studied my necktie . For some reason I became intensely conscious of my right hand , and put it in my trousers pocket . " That 's an idea , " he said at last . " Make it ten thousand . We might get some results . Who knows ? " " And do I help ? " " Well , stick around if you want . We might be able v to use an architect . " I knew then that he had already been told about me , and somehow I felt relieved . Mattingly turned to Miss Fleming : " Why did n't you tell me yesterday about going back there after hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed penitence . " I did n't want to show Dr. Appleby in a bad light , " she said . " Why not ? It would have been better to tell me than to spill it in public , would n't it ? " " I 'm  --  I 'm sorry , " she faltered , flushing beautifully . " Do n't let it worry you . . . . Now , about those opera-glasses . What was he doing with them ? " " Nothing , as far as I could tell . They were lying on his desk when I went in , just as I said . I 'm sure he did n't know I saw them . " Mattingly nodded and tugged at his watch . " Nearly twelve , " he said . " Suppose we meet at the building at one-thirty . All of us  --  Marsh , Miss Fleming , Peterson , and you , Grayson . " Whereupon he rose and left us . Marsh presented me to the others .  | " Your new boss , Harry . Mr. Grayson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little . Sam studied me while he bowed stiffly , pleasantly . " It 's a pity , " I said , " that we must meet under these circumstances , but we might try to make up for it by going to lunch together and getting better acquainted . Shall we ? " We did . At the door a pair of reporters stopped us . Behind them a photographer readied his camera . I think Harriett heard me sigh , for she turned and smiled . " Might as well give them a good picture , Mr. Grayson , " she said . " They 'll get one anyway . " They got one , but I would not pose . I merely slowed down a bit . Then the reporters asked for a statement . " I have nothing to say , " I replied , " except to tell you that there is a reward of ten thousand dollars offered for information leading to the person who murdered my uncle . Will you print that ? " " Try to stop us . How old are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , really , now " Married ? " " No . Listen , you two " Tell us how it feels to get six million " The four of us fled from the barrage and sought cover .  | CHAPTER VIII 1 . BY the time we finished an unhurried , quiet lunch and reached the building for our appointment with Mattingly I had the doubtful pleasure of seeing my name and picture on page one for the first time . It was not to be the last , by a good deal , but I could not know that , then . I wonder , now , what I would have done if I had known . " The picture is n't bad , " said Harriett . " It 's terrible , " I said . " Let 's get upstairs . " Mattingly was waiting for us . He sat in my uncle 's chair staring out the window to the south , with his back to us . He did not bother to greet us . Instead he spoke briefly to Harriett : " How was he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Turned half-way around , " she said , pointing . " Facing westward . " " Like this ? " He swung about , transferring his stare to the windows of the office building across Cresson Street . He chewed his gum intently and then shook his head in disgust . " Probably means nothing at all . . . . But before we drop it , I wish you 'd pretend you 're Mr. Grayson , Miss Fleming , while I come in the door . Use this pack  | of gum in place of the glasses . . . . All right , then . I 'm carrying a bottle of ginger-ale . Here I come . " Harriett 's demonstration was fetching , but quite meaningless to me . She sat staring moodily toward the west . Mattingly was well inside the inner office before she moved nervously , threw her hand quickly on the gum and looked up . " Rats ! " said Mattingly . " The old gent was jittery , that 's all . . . . ' Was the safe open or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It was closed and very probably locked . Ask Mr. Peterson about that . " Sam did not need to be asked . " Mr. Grayson , " he said , " had a horror of an open safe . He used to say there was no sense in having one if it was left unlocked . I have never seen this safe open except when he was actually getting something from it or putting something in , and if it was closed , it was locked . " " Yet , " mused Mattingly , " it was open when his body was found . There are no marks on it  --  no signs to show it had been tampered with . Does n't that seem to indicate that he was killed just after he had opened it ? " " Maybe , " I broke in , " he was forced to open it at pistol-point and then was shot . " " Yes , maybe , " agreed Mattingly , as he chewed his cud briskly , " but will you tell me why he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been forced to open the safe by someone holding a gun on him , do you think he 'd have taken his eyes off the man ? He would have  | to do that to account for the way he was shot . He must have had his head down when the shot was fired , which means that whoever did it was someone he was well acquainted with  --  someone he had no reason to distrust . " There was no reply to this . We were silent , thoughtful . And I was suddenly struck with the realization of how heavy this point would be against me if my visit of that night should ever become known . I had not very long to wait before I heard State 's Attorney Colgate elaborate on this very theory and thereby tighten the noose around my neck . Just then the telephone rang . Sam Peterson answered it and called to me . " For you , Mr. Grayson . " I picked up the instrument , wondering . A voice I thought familiar began to speak : " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' a reward for information . If I give you some , will I get the money ? " " That depends , " I said as slowly as I could , while waving frantically for Mattingly to cut in on the extension . " That depends on whether the information is of any value to the police . Who is this ? " Mattingly was by this time on the other ' phone , listening intently . " Well , " said the voice , ignoring my question , " I know somethin ' I ai n't told about yet , but I got ta be protected . Suppose a man did n't tell what he knew because he might get locked up ? Would you forget about that and still give him the reward ? "  | " I 'm sure the police would let a little fish go to get a big one . What is it you want to tell me ? " I saw Mattingly nod approvingly . The voice went on huskily , hesitantly : " Well , that night at the buildin ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if the speaker could not get his breath . I waited . There were some heavy dull clicks , but the line remained open . " Hello , " I said , jiggling the hook . No answer . Then the line went dead altogether , as if the other receiver had been replaced on its hook . I looked over at Mattingly . " Did you recognize the voice ? " I asked . " Of course . Blann , the watchman . . . . That 's funny . " " He had something to tell us , and then lost his nerve . " The lieutenant grunted . " He 'll talk when I get him here . Sam , give me his address , quick ! " Then he picked up the ' phone and got through to Headquarters . He issued a terse order to have the man brought in at once . But Blann was not to be found . He has not been seen or heard from since that time . Wherever he may have gone , he left in a terrific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his belongings . His clothes , even to his hat , his watch and a small amount of money , were found in his room . The house he lived in had but one other tenant , who had seen nothing , heard nothing . No one had seen him leave the house , and yet he was not  | there . And the telephone call has been proved to have come from that house . I can not help but feel that Blann had something more to tell than simply of a man who ran past him that night , or of the shot he fired . He could have told that much without endangering himself in the slightest , as he had hinted . But there must be more than that . He was involved  --  according to his own words  --  in some wrongdoing and wanted immunity . Immunity from what , no one seems to know . I took him to be a man who reads very little , yet if by some chance he should read this in his hiding-place , I beg him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suffer what slight consequences there may be , but to save my life if he can . 2 . Whoever the murderer of my uncle may be , he does not seem to have been greatly imperiled by the work done by Mattingly during the rest of that afternoon . I am afraid Marsh and I were not too subtle in taking chairs in the inner office , so that we could hear everything that went on . Mattingly did not object . I think he was glad to have us there , for some reason . Possibly he felt that our presence there would put the interviewed ones more at their ease than if he were alone . The three tenants  --  Spurrier , Barton and Flick ? came first , and in that order . Spurrier was an investment broker who had a small office on the ninth floor , Marsh told me . He was a large man , courteous , affable  | and , to me , quite convincing . He limped slightly as he walked , and carried a cane awkwardly , as if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've called you again , Mr. Spurrier , " he said , " to see if there are any details we 've missed . Hope you do n't mind . . . . The building records show that you were in your office from some time before seven until ten thirty-five . I wish you 'd go over that period again , in detail . " Spurrier was patient with the lieutenant . " As I said yesterday , I was in my office for two reasons . One was that I wanted to work up a bond list for one of my clients . I finished it about eight o'clock . The other was that I wanted to kill time in order to meet my wife as she came from the movies . I stayed in my office until ten-thirty , reading a magazine and smoking , and left shortly after I heard ten-thirty strike on the Hearst Tower clock . I went down in the elevator with Johnson , walked to the Century Theater , met my wife at tenforty and went home . That 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a while ago , but which does n't mean much , I guess . " Mattingly stroked his jaw and grunted . " What is it ? " Spurrier smiled dubiously . " It 's so small I feel silly telling you about it , but as Johnson and I were coming down in the elevator , about ten thirty-five , we heard a noise which might have been a shot , but which probably was a blow-out . I remember saying something to John-  | son about it . I think I said : Hot night to fix a tire . ' You might ask Johnson about it . " " I will . Are you sure it was outside the building ? " " Quite sure . " " Did you see anyone fixing a tire when you got to the street ? " " No . " " Did you see any parked car at all ? " " None that I can remember . " Spurrier then left the office . He will , I am sure , be surprised to learn here what that sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the corner during his interview could have told him quite definitely that it was not a blow-out . During the short talk Spurrier had sat with his ailing leg stretched out before him , with the heel taking the weight . I could not help wondering about that leg . I knew the thought I had was ridiculous , but nevertheless I spoke to Mattingly about it : " What 's wrong with his leg ? Has he told you ? " " Knocked his shin on the cellar-steps , he told me , " explained Mattingly . " When was that ? " " Day before yesterday  --  the day your uncle was killed . . . . Why ? " I shrugged . " I was thinking that if anyone had jumped from the second floor , he 'd probably be needing a cane , too . " Mattingly dismissed the idea . " Forget it , " he said . " All the windows on that floor were locked from the  | inside when we got here that night . And Spurrier left the building openly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spurrier had left openly , from personal observation , and promptly dropped the subject . Alexander Barton , the tenth-floor tenant , was slow in answering the summons sent by Mattingly , for a reason that was apparent when he finally appeared . He was drunk . Mattingly did not seem surprised . " Still hitting it up , Barton ? " he asked . The man chose to be offended . 1 le held himself upright with a hand on the door-frame and looked down at the red-haired lieutenant with as much dignity and condescension as his bleary-eyed face could assume . He was a tall man , and must have been a handsome one in better years . " I beg your pardon , sir , " he said . " Are you  --  hic-insinuating ? " Never mind , never mind , " soothed Mattingly . " Have a chair and take it easy . . . . Have you thought over what I asked you yesterday ? " " If  --  his  --  if you mean about Mr. Grayson 's death , " said Barton , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to add to  --  his  --  my former statement . " " You might tell me if anything disturbed your sleep that night . " A pained expression crossed Barton 's face . " My dear sir , " he protested , " I have assured you that I know nothing . I admit I had , ah , taken some medicine that evening , and  --  his  --  nodded until one of your men woke me. "  | Mattingly must have become impatient then . " You mean , " he said flatly , " that you had drunk yourself into insensibility and were lying half-dressed on your office floor when the detective woke you . Is that right ? " " If you must be crude , my good man , I sup-pose " And furthermore , you have a habit of sleeping off your liquor in your office . You do it frequently . What I want to know is whether you also have the habit of roaming through the building late at night . " " What  --  hic  --  makes you say that ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the building somewhere near ten-thirty Wednesday night ? " " I  --  I ? hic  --  was not ! " " Then how do you account for your necktie being found on the stairs near the sixth floor ? The charwoman says it was n't there at quarter to ten , and it was found by my men at eleven-thirty . Well ? " " How do you know it was  --  hic  --  mine ? " " Because I asked your wife about it yesterday afternoon . " Barton blinked dully several times and sat with his mouth agape . " Come on , man ! Let 's have it ! " " Well , maybe I  --  hic  --  did go downstairs about that time . I guess I went to get some more  --  medicine . " " You guess you did ? Do n't you know ? " " I 'm  --  I 'm not quite certain . " Mattingly looked at me in disgust and shook his head .  | " So you went downstairs to get more medicine . Where did you get it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money to the watchman and  --  hic  --  asked him to get it for me . And he  --  hicdid , I think . " " Why did n't you use the elevators ? " " It aggravates my  --  hic  --  illness . " " When did you go back to your office ? " " I do n't know . I believe 1 stayed on the  --  his  --  first floor , somewhere , until my hot  --  my medicine was empty . " The wreck of a man was now all penitence and remorse . " That 's all you know ? " " That 's all I  --  hic  --  know . " Mattingly dismissed him with a curt wave and he reeled out of the room . 3 . After Barton 's story I was a little clearer on one point . This had been the reason I had seen no one as I entered the building , that night . With Johnson away somewhere , Blann either had depended upon Barton to watch the door or had simply not considered that the door would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and since nothing had happened on previous short absences , he expected nothing to happen on this one . This , of course , is purely my own theory concerning that wide-open , deserted door . Flick , the third tenant , was not in his office . Mattingly left a message for him to come up when he got in ,  | and helped to fill the interval by studying his notes and chewing his gum . Richard Marsh , who had been silently observant throughout the interviews , talked to me : " The entire tenant list is being gone over , of course , but so far only these three have been connected in any way with the case . " " What else is being done ? " I asked . I think my desire to know can be understood . Marsh shrugged . " Ca n't say . After all , I 'm only an onlooker . " Flick came in within a few minutes . He had been out on a call , he said . Was there anything more he could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man about thirty , with the blackest shoe-button eyes I have ever seen . He sat down nonchalantly and lit a cigarette . " I wanted to ask you , " said Mattingly , " if you can recall hearing any unusual sound inside or outside of the building Wednesday night . You left just after eleven , according to the night slip . Can you add anything to your testimony of yesterday ? " Flick flicked his cigarette and shook his head . " Not a thing , " he said . " You were in your office the whole evening ? " " Did n't leave it once . We 're very busy . I was trying to get some work done for the next day . " " The real estate business must be picking up . " " Well , we have n't been in business very long , you see , and I 'm trying hard to work up some deals to get started . "  | " You work in your office a good deal , I understand . At night , I mean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get going it 'll be easier . " " How long have you been a tenant in the building ? " " About two months . " " When you left that night , did you happen to see a car near the building anywhere ? " " You mean a parked car ? " " Yes . " " No . " " Or hear a blow-out near by ? " " Sorry . Did n't notice any noise at any time , anywhere . " Mattingly drummed on the desk with his fingers and leaned back and stared through the window . Then he shrugged . " I 'm sorry I troubled you , Mr. Flick . If anything that happened that night should occur to you , even the smallest thing , please let me know . " Flick rose alertly and half-saluted with a casual hand . " I sure will , Lieutenant , " he said , and disappeared . Mattingly transferred his stare to the door through which Flick had gone . " He 's far , far too sharp , that fellow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of broken glass  --  smooth as the devil until you get to the edge . See what I mean ? " I saw what he meant clearly enough , but I could not see the answer to a question that suddenly came to my mind : Which of these three tenants  --  Spurrier , Barton  | and Flick  --  was my " heavy-footed man , " the man who had come upon me as I hid on the stairs ? Flick , who had just left us , was too cat-footed to be considered ; Spurrier had a bad leg and walked with a cane ; Barton 's step would have been too unsteady , unsure , if he was as far gone in liquor as I had been led to believe . But the question was : was he ?  | CHAPTER IX 1 . DR . APPLEBY breezed in shortly after Flick had gone . He greeted Mattingly cheerfully and explained that he was on his way to see a patient and could n't stay long . " But I stopped in hoping you would be here , Lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you if I could have my other medicine-kit now . Are you through with it ? " I was quite at a loss as to what he meant , but Mattingly seemed to know . He considered briefly and then turned to the safe behind him , opened it and drew forth a small black case of the type physicians carry . Before handing it over he unbuckled the straps , glanced within , and refastened it . " Here you are , Doctor , " he said , holding it out . " Thanks . " Appleby reached for it and took it negligently . " Is that the only one you have ? " Mattingly wanted to know . " Oh , no , " said Appleby . " This is my spare . I have another one just like it , but I used to make so many trips here from my office that I hit upon the plan of keeping a case here with all the drugs and instruments I needed for Mr. Grayson . Pure laziness on my part . I hate to carry things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the safe ? Seems like a queer place . Not very valuable , is it ? " " It was my idea originally to keep the case here in the office , and Mr. Grayson 's idea to lock it up . He was afraid it might be upset , I think , and make a mess , if it was left out in the office somewhere . " " Did you get it out of the safe each time you came ? " Appleby shook his head amusedly . " Hardly , " he said . " Mr. Grayson was rather particular about who went into his safe . " " That 's what I thought , " nodded Mattingly . " He took the trouble of getting it for you every time you came to examine him ? " " It was almost like a ritual in church , Lieutenant . As soon as I came in he would swing around and unlock the safe , making sure every time to hide the combination with his body so I could n't possibly see it . Then he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me to go ahead . When I was through using it , I 'd put it back in the usual place and shut the doors , and he 'd immediately twirl the dial himself . There was never any variation to it . " " Thank you , Doctor . That explains it very well . . . . Now , what about those opera-glasses ? You said you had never seen them , but do you have any idea what he may have been looking at ? I hardly think he was interested in watching pretty women in the building across the street . What 's your idea on that ? " Appleby shrugged eloquently . " Your guess is as  | good as mine . Maybe he just wanted to watch the boats in the harbor . They 're very interesting , you know . " " Yeah , maybe . . . . Before you go , Doctor , shake hands with the heir to the Grayson millions , even though he looks too healthy to need a doctor yet a while . " Appleby grinned at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of a burn yesterday and ca n't shake hands , " he said , " but consider it clone . . . . I 'm terribly sorry about all this . It must have been a shock to you . " " It was , " I replied . " If there is any way I can he of service ? " I do n't know of a thing you can do , Doctor , thank you , " I said . As I spoke to him I was wondering about the description my uncle had given of him in his letter . He had said " pretty much of a damned fool . " All through Appleby 's testimony at the inquest and during his presence in the office with us I had tried to discover what it was that had led my uncle to say that . And I was unsuccessful . The doctor seemed possibly a bit conscious of his good looks . But this slight fault , if my diagnosis was correct , would certainly not justify my uncle 's term for him . Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at the world and found it all askew ? This line of thought led me naturally to a question : " My uncle was not a very easy patient for you , was he ? " Appleby smiled . " Not very . He had a tremendous  | will-power , and God help the man who tried to change his mind , or tried to make him do something he did n't want to do . I think that 's all he had against me . I was always telling him to do things . " " Speaking of will , " broke in Mattingly , " reminds me of something I wanted to ask you , Doctor . Why did n't Mr. Grayson make some provision in his will for the Children 's Hospital ? You are on the staff there , are n't you ? " The doctor pursed his lips and shrugged . " He probably thought he had done enough , " he said . " He gave the hospital several large donations in the past year , principally at my suggestion . " " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or four gifts , I believe , totaling some thirty or thirty-five thousand dollars . " " Which , after all , was n't a great deal , was it ? " " It was a tremendous help to the hospital , but I suppose it was very small when you consider Mr. Grayson 's means . Since there was nothing more that Mattingly desired to know , at the moment , and nothing more that the doctor seemed to want to say , he then excused himself , nodded to me good-naturedly and departed , bag in hand . 2 . The doctor was our last visitor of the afternoon . I think Mattingly had meant to call some others to the office  --  Johnson , the elevator man , probably , and Mary  | Janowski , the charwoman  --  but he had barely said good-bye to Appleby , stuffed a stick of gum into his mouth and glanced again at his notes when the telephone rang . The not been found . " Has he skipped ? " I asked , as the receiver went down . " Looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? or something else . Very odd that a man should call you up the way he did , hang up in the middle of his talk and then disappear . " " Did he hang up ? " I asked . " Meaning what ? " " Meaning  --  did n't it seem as though the line was open for some little time after he stopped talking ? Remember the noise he made when he stopped ? Just like a hand had been put over his mouth . Then shortly afterward  --  about ten seconds  --  the line clicked and went dead . Somebody put back that receiver , but was it Blann ? " Mattingly stared at me for a moment with widened eyes , and then , without bothering to answer me , reached for his hat . " Good God ! " he said . " What 's that address ? " He riffled through the papers before him , found what he wanted and ran out . We saw him no more that day . I have said before , I think , that Blann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone as he spoke to me , and what followed , no one knows . I have  | often wondered if John Blann is still alive  --  if he may yet return to tell what it was he knew about my uncle 's death . And I have wondered , too , if it might not he that the gasp I had heard was John Blann 's last earthly utterance . Possibly my memory has played tricks with me , over the months that have passed since then , but I can very easily make myself believe that John Blann 's gasp was not from a hand placed over his mouth but from two hands placed about his throat in a murderous and desperate grip . Did my uncle 's murderer also kill John Blann ?  | CHAPTER X 1 . I FEEL that I have given a great deal of unnecessary detail so far in my story , but it has been done purposely . I may have touched upon some slight fact that will bear fruit with further study , or said something that might be used to convince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am nearly done , however , with detail . The events that followed in the next few days have little value in being related . A description of the horror of my uncle 's funeral , for example , and of the loneliness and gloom of his house , has no place here . Nor is this the place to tell of the minuteness  --  and absolute futility  --  of Mattingly 's further study of the case . I was not with him during the whole of his ensuing investigation , but I saw and heard enough to tell me that there was not one more material fact uncovered . And Mattingly , in his disappointment and frustration , gradually descended from the reasonably pleasant man I have described to a bleary-eyed , sharp-tongued hellcat . No doubt the Commissioner was pressing him for results , and the results were not forthcoming . I could see dejection and fury in the lieutenant 's very walk .  | I will make one exception when I say that nothing further of importance happened . Something did happen ; something that turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in this cell and give me the unhappy prospect of being hung . It concerned George Clark , who , it will be remembered , was my uncle 's bald-headed servant . All through the evening of my arrival and the day of the inquest we had not met . It was not until the following day  --  Saturday  --  that we came face to face . This was to prove a disastrous meeting for me . I should have foreseen the danger , but I did not . It was through George Clark that the whole affair fell down upon me , yet despite that fact , I do not blame him in the slightest degree . I blame only myself . On that Saturday morning my uncle 's body was brought home , and George Clark came home with it , like a faithful dog . He saw me as he entered , but we did not speak until the casket was properly placed and the living-room curtains drawn . Then he backed out of the room and started , I think , for his usual place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . At the moment I spoke his back was toward me . I could not see his face . He stopped dead in his tracks , as if he had bumped into a stone wall , and then stood still as a statue . " George , " I said again , " do you remember me ? " At this he turned slowly about . I could see him begin to tremble , suddenly , and then I saw his face . It was  | ashy-pale and his eyes were wide with horror . He stared at me as if I were a ghost  --  or a murderer . " George ! " I said . " Are you ill ? What 's the mat-ter ? " He has not yet answered me . He continued his stare for what seemed to be minutes and then gasped , turned quickly and scurried away as if he were running for his life . The reason for his terror  --  simple as it later proved to be  --  escaped me completely . I was mystified , and I remained mystified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck the following week . From that moment on he avoided me as though I had leprosy . All through the funeral I could see him across the room or across the grave , staring , staring , staring at me . When the ceremony was completed and the limousines returned us to my uncle 's home I could feel his eyes  --  from the car behind  --  boring into me . Once in the house I thought I could speak to him and set at rest whatever fear he might have had of me , but he would not answer my call . I went to search for him . I found him in a corner of the kitchen , huddled down in a crouch and staring at me like a bird before a snake . " What is it , George ? " I asked . " Have I hurt you in some way ? Why are you afraid of me ? " There was no reply . There was only a shrinking movement of his shoulders and an increased distrust and alarm in those eyes . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I done to make you look like that ? "  | His only answer was to shudder violently , close his eyes and fall to the floor in a dead faint . 2 . That was the beginning of a desperate illness that lasted nearly a week . I assumed that the long strain of watching over my uncle 's body , combined with the shock of meeting me and hearing my voice , had been too much for his frail body and mind . He lay for days in a complete stupor . Dr. Appleby told me that the poor man nearly died . I am sincerely glad he did not , even though I am fully aware that if he had , I would today be free . Free ! However , on the following Friday  --  why does it seem that most ill luck comes on Friday ? ? he rallied . He opened his eyes , looked about without seeing me , and asked the nurse for some water . She got it quickly and held the glass to his lips . Then , while he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started violently and spilled the water over the bedclothes . " Nurse ! " he cried . " Nurse ! Do n't leave me ! " The woman spoke soothingly to him . " Of course not , Mr. Clark . I 'll stay right here . " He then motioned to her . He wanted her to bend down to him . She did so , as she would have done with a child , and let him whisper to her and nodded . Then she straightened up and turned to me . " If you do n't mind , Mr. Grayson , " she said , " would you leave the room a while ? Mr. Clark would like to be alone . " She shrugged indulgently.  | I went downstairs to the living-room and occupied myself by watching the first large drops of an oncoming summer storm . As I think back , now , it was a prophetic and ill-omened squall that then came upon the city . There were sudden , startling flashes of lightning and the thunder rolled in deep , vibrant echoes . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that as I watched I felt an unreasonable foreboding . I must have stayed at the window for a quarter-hour or more , conscious of a vague uneasiness and of a growing terror . Terror , maybe , from the violence of the storm , or terror from something far more malevolent . And when the door-bell rang I jumped and felt my knees go weak . It was Mattingly . Behind him were two of his men . " What 's all this about , Mr. Grayson ? " he asked sharply as he led the way inside . " All what ? " I managed to splutter in reply . " Some woman just ' phoned me . Said George Clark wanted to see me about the murder . Where is he ? " I could not utter a sound , but pointed mutely to the stairs and followed his quick ascent . The nurse was standing at the head of the staircase , waiting for him . She beckoned to Mattingly and led him to the sick man 's room . I allowed the others to enter first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of the plainclothes men . Just why I did n't want George Clark to see me I ca n't tell , but I did n't . Mattingly went straight to the point : " The nurse  | said you had something you wanted to tell me about Mr. Grayson 's death . What is it ? " The shining bald head on the pillow nodded violently , and the feverishly-bright eyes blinked in the effort he made to speak . The sick man 's cheeks were flushed and as shiny-dry as his glistening head . " I wanted to tell you , " he whispered at last , " about something that happened . . . just before Mr. Grayson . . . was murdered . " He paused to regain his breath . I felt a tremendous pity for the faithful old fellow , and yet when the meaning of his words sank into my consciousness , I lost all feeling but terror and desperation . Mattingly waited . Then George went on : " I talked . . . with the man who . . . killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torturing sensation of pressure made itself apparent , suddenly , in my chest , as if tight iron chains had been thrown about me . Memory of an incident flooded in upon me appallingly . The ' phone call from the station ! " I talked on the telephone with the . . . man who killed him , I say . . . at ten o'clock that night . . . He called to find out where Mr. . . . Grayson was . . . and I told him . " " Who was it , man ? Who was it ? " " I did n't know . . . then . I did n't even remember the telephone call . . . until . . . I heard the same voice . . . again . " " Of course , " I said , and left the room immediately .  | " And that voice was ? " " It was . . . him ! " With this hoarsely shouted word the old man looked straight at me and pointed a shaking , damning finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I simply stood there , stunned , while Mattingly stared at me and smiled in grim astonishment . Then he made a motion . One of the men stepped beside me . " What about it , Mr. Grayson ? " asked Mattingly . My drooping head , I think , was sufficient answer .  | CHAPTER XI 1 . As I sit here on a hard stool in Cell 19 , with the reality of harsh prison clothing against my skin and bare stone walls and steel bars all about me , I wonder how it can be that the few people I call my friends believe me ? really , deep down in their hearts , believe me  --  to beinnocent of my uncle 's murder . I am thinking , now , of the mass of evidence that has been proven against me , opposing which there is only my own word . My own weak , useless word as I gave it at the trial and as I have given it here in this account of the whole affair . The cumulative weight of that evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimony concerning my presence in Baltimore on the night of the murder led immediately , of course , to what Mattingly thought , and still thinks , was a complete solution of the case . My fingerprints matched the smears left on the desk , revolver and doorknob . I was quickly identified by the attendant at the magazine-stand at Pennsylvania Station as the man who had made a telephone call from that location , and Pat Geare , although he did what he could to help me , was forced to admit that he had taken me to the building at ten-fifteen that night . Mrs. Carmody , my landlady , could do nothing else but tell of my absence from Holly Point . A little digging by Mattingly  | soon brought out the story of my dispute with my uncle five years before . George Clark , I must admit , was not an eager witness in spite of his previous action toward me , but the facts  --  as he had seen them  --  concerning the checkbook and concerning my uncle 's instructions about me , were easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelming , and Ross Colgate made the most of it . The jury , confronted with the entire one-sided mass of facts , did their duty properly according to their best judgment , even though I must assure them and Ross Colgate that they were wrong . I am still clear-minded enough to know that they could not have done otherwise , but let me make this one Hat statement about all that evidence : Not one hit of actual , direct proof has been made to show that I aimed that pistol , pulled that trigger , and sent a bullet into my uncle 's head . Lawyers will say , correctly , I suppose , that direct proof of any misdeed is a rare thing , and is , besides , seldom required for just verdicts . They will say , too , that circumstantial evidence , when properly weighted . and evaluated , is not the erroneous thing that the word seems to imply . " Circumstantial evidence , " they like to say , " is not so much evidence as it is a method of reasoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of facts is entire and complete , and admits of no other result , the result can not be wrong . " They usually cap this argument by using the analogy of the dead sheep . When a throat-torn sheep is found ,  | they say , and near it stands a dog with blood and wool on its muzzle , the evidence is entirely circumstantial but the clog gets shot just the same . But is n't it possible that the poor hound may have come upon the sheep long after it was dead , and incriminated itself by a mere curious nosing about ? Is n't it ? No dog was ever caught with a bloodier , woolier snout than mine  --  and no newborn puppy ever deserved to be destroyed less . 2 . What can be done about it ? Several things might be done , but I greatly fear they will not . First , the letter might be found . The letter my uncle sent me , and which lies somewhere south of Harrisburg . That alone should outweigh all the blood and wool that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear on the scene . Since it seems that he will not come forth of his own volition , find him . Make him tell whatever it is he knows . Make him understand that a man 's life depends on the words he can but will not speak . Find him and learn what it was he began to say ! Third , and of supreme importance , find the man who murdered Bond Grayson . Someone did it . That much we all agree upon . Someone . The State of Maryland says it was I , and , unfortunately , has a remarkably complete basis for saying so . I say it was not , and I have no facts at all outside this tale of mine to prove my innocence . And since the State is stronger than I am , the  | State wins the argument by dangling me at the end of a rope . On February nineteenth next . The State is not cruel , vindictive , heartless . It is simply just  --  or tries to be . The State wants to hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection to the People of the State . But instead they are hanging me . It is all a grim , horrifying joke . Maryland justice is swift . It is now but two months since the murder and everything is over but the last final , short act . The trial , which I do not intend to enlarge upon , was begun less than a month after I was first apprehended , and lasted only two days . There was no reason why it should have taken longer , for the evidence , the sentiment and the oratory were almost wholly one-sided , and the result was never in doubt . I have filled the time since then by setting down this tale , and Harriett , bless her heart , is typing it for me . I shall be through in a few more words , and I dread to think of the long , vacant days ahead , with nothing to fill them as this work has . There is nothing I can do except  --  wait . Harriett , dear girl , is full of hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who might be able to help me , if he will ; a man who can discover the truth behind this affair if anyone can . He is an instructor at Johns Hopkins University , and his name is Clifford Wells . He is a scientist . He has been abroad all summer and presumably will know nothing whatever of the case until he reads this story of mine . Harriett insists that this will be an advantage , for  | he will therefore have an open and unbiased mind , she says , and will not have been affected by the half-truths and luridness which have accompanied this affair from the day of the murder . God knows I hope she is right .  | CHAPTER I 1 . IN a sun-filled room in Maryland Hall two figures sat quietly . One , tall and lean and browned from a summer out of doors , was hunched over a battered desk , reading . The other , slender , comely , anxious , studied the floor , the walls , the lean hunched reader , with the patience of despair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they turned . Through the windows the restful campus of Johns Hopkins University stretched green and smooth , and beyond it rose the comfortable Colonial grace of Gilman Hall , wide and pleasing to the eye . On such an afternoon , and in such surroundings , murder and hanging and despair might well have been mere terms in the abstract , difficult of conception ; yet the two figures seated so silently were thinking of such things , and not as abstracts but as realities . The reader was Clifford Wells , Ph . D. , instructor in physics , dabbler in the realm of scientific logic , student in the arts of microphotography and criminal deduction , and a famous name in police records as a breaker of alibis . The slender , comely one was Harriett Fleming , and the pages being read had come from Cell 19.  | The afternoon wore on , accompanied by an increased brilliance in the room from the lowering sun and a slowly decreased height in the pile of unread manuscript . At length , and with a sigh from Harriett Fleming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page had been read  --  and read as slowly and carefully as the first  --  Wells placed it face down on the ninety-nine typewritten sheets which had preceded it and relaxed his body by the simple expedient of swinging back in his swivel-chair and ensconcing both feet on his desk . The girl , watching him eagerly , waited for him to speak . Wells did not look at her  --  made no sign to show he knew she was in the room . He reached over with a grunt for a crusted , polished briar pipe , filled it by sense of touch , lit a match , and then forgot he had done so . With the pipe in one hand and the burning match in the other , he let his thoughts beguile him , all the while staring at the Manuscript From Cell 19 . The match burned lower , lower . " Professor Wells ! " " Eh ? " said he , turning to Harriett with a blink . " The match ! You 'll burn " Ouch ! " The offending flame was thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protesting thumb was sucked . " An example , " decided Wells , as if speaking to a class in Physics II , " of the power of matter over mind . . . . Anyway , I 'm not a professor . You compliment me. "  | " But everyone calls you that  --  even the newspapers . " Wells grinned boyishly , shrugged his shoulders and went back to his thoughts . He put the pipe , still unlit , between his teeth and puffed great irnaginary clouds of smoke as he rose and strode back and forth the length of the littered bright room . Harriett 's eyes followed him protestingly . She was loath to break into his concentration , and yet she could n't help asking the question : " Do you think Oliver Grayson is ? " Innocent ? " He picked up the sentence smoothly , without hesitating in his stride . " It 's just a bit early for me to decide that , is n't it ? " And the pacing continued . The " professor 's " leanness was not emaciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early thirties and in the best of condition . His shoulders were wide and flat , making his coat hang upon him shapelessly , and his trousers flapped like sails about his long legs as he walked , yet the ease and grace of his movements refused to be hidden by clothing . His sun-bronzed face was pleasant , alert , composed , and seemed , if anything , younger than his thirty-two years should have allowed . Taken as a whole , he presented no exceptional picture of a young man in any particular  --  except one . His height and build and general conformation were not unusually unusual ; his face not handsome and not too plain ; his health not excessively apparent . But then there were his hands . Anyone with half an eye could not fail to notice them .  | They were larger hands than seemed to be called for by the rest of his body and dominated his whole appearance . The fingers were long and strong and blunt , and the palms wide . Powerful , energetic hands , yes , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about spiritedly as he strode along . He stopped once at his desk , riffled through the manuscript quickly , found the page he wanted , read it again gravely , and returned to his pacing . The long legs took him the length of the room in four steps . One , two , three , four , turn . One , two , three , four , turn . At last he halted , knocked the cold bowl of his pipe against the waste-basket  --  sending good brown tobacco to the floor  --  and turned to look at Harriett as if he were seeing her for the first time . " Well ? " she asked eagerly . He replied with a question : " Is it hokum , or is it fact ? Do you believe everything he says here ? " " I do , without the slightest question . You see , Mr. Wells , I know him  --  I know the kind of man he is . " " You 're in love with him , I think . " The professor put this as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not deny it . " Which means , of course , " he went on , " that your personal opinion is valueless . You 'd nod your head if he said the moon was made of green cheese . " " Do n't you believe him , Mr. Wells ? Ca n't you feel that he 's telling the truth ? " The professor shrugged . " I 'm not a clairvoyant , " he said . " I know no more about it than what I 've read  | here . " He pointed to the pile of loose sheets . " And as far as feeling that he 's telling the truth , no , I do n't . Here is a condemned man writing to save his life . He 'd naturally be expected to write as passionately as he could , and create as much sympathetic feeling as he could . . . . I do n't feel things . I either know them or I do n't . " " Then , " said Harriett , hopelessly , " you wo n't take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up at her with amazement . " Women always jump at conclusions , " he said . " What makes you think I wo n't take it ? " " Well , " ? defensively ? " you said you did n't be-lieve " Not at all . I said I did n't know . And that means , by the same token , that I certainly do n't disbelieve him . . . . If you 've come to me to find some way to prove his innocence and nothing more I 'm afraid I ca n't take the case . But , on the other hand , if you want me to find out what really happened that night , if I can , I 'll be glad to tackle it . " Harriett 's eyes glowed with her thankfulness , and a quick smile beautified her face . " But you know what might happen , of course , " he warned , holding out an explanatory , expressive hand . " You mean , " said Harriett , " that you may make the case against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of setting him free ? " " Precisely . " " Then please begin at once , " she said firmly .  | " You 'll find nothing that can harm him any more than he has already been harmed . The story is true ! " Wells walked to the window and stood watching the campus with his hands clasped behind his broad , straight back . Harriett saw the fingers of one hand moving  --  saw a bright silver coin being twirled dexterously , now in view , now gone . It seemed to be weaving about almost of its own accord . " I 'd be willing to wager a good deal , " said Wells , without turning , " that the story is n't true , in every respect . Oh , do n't misunderstand inc . I only mean that it would n't be quite possible for him to fail to stress those things in his favor or tone down the small items he 's not very proud of  --  what I 'm trying to say is that I do n't believe he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make himself in his story , even if he did n't kill his uncle . " He swung about and grinned at Harriett . " So , on that basis , I 'll take the case and do my best to find out what really happened . " " Agreed , " she said , gravely . " It 's all I could possibly ask for . " The professor spun the coin into the air carelessly , caught it as it descended and opened his hand . It was nowhere to be seen . " I suppose you realize , " he said , " how poor the chances are of doing anything for him ? This is the middle of September . Mr. Grayson was shot in July . The trail is colder than a cake of dry ice . Witnesses may not be available , or if they are available their memories might not be depended upon after two months and more . "  | " But the court records will tell you anything you want to know , wo n't they ? " Wells shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " I mean the people who really know something , assuming there are such people to be found . " Harriett nodded slowly . " Oh , " she said . " Therefore , " summarized the professor , " you must not expect too much . I 'll do what I can , but if there should be nothing to be done , nothing to be found out " He shrugged meaningly . " Is the point clear ? " " Yes , " said Harriett . " No false hopes ? " " No  --  false hopes . " " No regrets if we fail ? " " No regrets , " said Harriett , " if we fail . " " Then we 'll begin , " said Wells , reaching for a battered gray felt hat , " by visiting our mutual friend the lieutenant . I 'd like to ask him some questions . " And the bright coin , which had come back into his hand from nowhere , was flipped once more into the air and landed expertly in his vest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lieutenant , it seemed , was free . Would he see them ? Yes , indeed he would . Send ' em right up . How do you do , Miss Fleming . And hello , Professor ! So you 're in this thing now ? " Yes , Matt . I 'm in it . Do n't know why , though . "  | " Modest , are n't you ? Expect to get anywhere ? " " Hard to tell , yet . You think you 've done pretty well , eh ? " " Never did a neater , tighter job in my life , if I say so myself . And never hope to . " Harriett said : " Have you read Mr. Grayson 's story , Lieutenant ? I sent a copy to you . " " That I have , Miss Fleming . And so have Mr. Colgate and the Commissioner . I 'm sorry for your sake , but it 's just  --  just a good story to them and to me . It 'll make fine reading when the newspaper starts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her dejection . " Then you 're not even trying to believe him , are you ? " " Now do n't be too hard on us , Miss Fleming . There 's not a single thing in it we did n't already know , except that business of running out of the building and being shot at by John Blann . And that certainly does n't help him . " Wells , seated negligently on a corner of the lieutenant 's desk , leaned forward . " Listen , Matt , " he said , " I 've helped you and the Department a good deal in the past , have n't I ? " The red head nodded in friendly fashion . " That 's right , Professor . You 've helped us a lot . " " And what payment have I received ? " " Why , nothing , I guess . But that 's only because you 've never asked for anything . " " Right . I 've never asked for anything . . . . But I 'm asking for something now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense , you know , " said Mattingly . Wells smiled and balanced his bright coin on the tip of a finger . " I do n't want any money , Matt . All I want you to give me is a copy of every report on the Grayson case you made to the Commissioner . " " You want  --  what ? " " Is that very much to ask for ? " " Well , no , I suppose not , " said Mattingly , not too cheerfully . Then he grumbled : " What do you want those for ? " The coin ran down Wells ' finger and into his flexed palm . " To study up a bit on the case , of course , " he said . " What else ? " " Why not go to Ross Colgate and get the trial records ? They 'll give you the whole thing . " " Oh , no . They would n't give me the whole thing . I want your reports , Matt . " " Then stop doing tricks with that quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd do . What d' you expect to find in them ? " The professor grinned pleasantly . " This is just between the three of us , Matt , " he said , " and need n't go any farther unless you want it to . Tell me , now , if you did n't come across certain facts in your investigation that have n't yet been explained . Were n't there some small things  --  oh , I do n't mean anything that would really clear young Grayson  --  but were n't there some small things that you still do n't know the reason for ? Things which were naturally reported to the Commis-  | sioner , but which were not touched on at all during the trial ? Honestly , now , were n't there ? " Mattingly stuffed a stick of gum into his mouth and sniffed . " You 're guessing right wild there , are n't you , Professor ? " " You have n't said I 'm wrong . " " Have n't said anything . " " Which means , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there are such things as I speak of . . . . How about it , Matt ? Do I get the reports ? " " I guess you will , Professor , but not from me . We have rules around here , you know . I 'll ask the Commissioner about it , if you want me to , and see what he says about it . " Wells cogitated . " Thanks , Matt , but I think I 'll see him about it myself , if you do n't mind . Is he in now ? " " Yes , he 's in . Go on up . " " See you later . Come along , Miss Fleming . " He led Harriett into the corridor and toward the elevators . " Mr. Wells , how did you know that ? How were you so certain that there would be some evidence which did n't come up at the trial ? " A shrug and the expressive flourish of a hand . " I did n't know , and I was n't certain at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems almost impossible that every bit of evidence that was found should point toward young Grayson and none away from him . The case is simply too perfect . I despise perfection . It 's not natural . . . . Therefore , when I intimated to the lieutenant that there might be some unexplained points , I  | was n't taking much of a chance . And when he did n't deny it I knew I was right . Simple , is n't it ? " " Now that you explain it , yes . " " Here we are , Miss Fleming . In you go . " Harriett found herself in a large anteroom , and sat down while Wells spoke to the man on duty at the Commissioner 's door . In a moment that door was opened to him and he disappeared within . Minutes passed . Presently Lieutenant Mattingly , bearing a large brown manila envelope and an exceedingly thoughtful countenance , strode through the anteroom hurriedly , pausing only to give his flaming hair a bit of smoothing with his hand before entering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thirty . Harriett , buoyed up by a new-found and strengthening hope , did not mind the wait . She sat patiently . At last the oaken door opened to emit the two : Wells with one genial hand on Mattingly 's shoulder and with the other grasping the thick brown envelope victoriously . He winked delightedly at Harriett from behind Mattingly 's back . " Now , " he said , " we 'll be on our way . So long , Matt , and thanks a lot . " " So long , Professor , " said the detective . " Be sure to let me know when  --  and if  --  you find your man . " " Of course , " said Wells . " When  --  and if . "  | CHAPTER II 1 . IN the elevator on the way to the first floor , Wells grinned boyishly and tapped the envelope . " Progress , Miss Fleming , progress . " " What did you find out ? " He wagged a finger . " No details now . First a bite to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 's nearly dinnertime . We 'll eat first and talk afterward . " " So be it . " Harriett hopped along nobly to match his absently normal pace , and fought down her curiosity with a sigh . " Not even a hint , " she asked , " to make a sauce for my sandwich ? " " Not even a hint , except to say that the story your young man wrote has not been entirely wasted . I fear the Commissioner has been greatly touched , and worried to boot . He has visions of hanging the wrong man . " " For which praise be . . . . That means he 'll help us  --  I mean help you  --  as much as he can ? " " Oh , undoubtedly . Mattingly has orders to give us anything in the Department we want , including his own services if we care to use them . " " How does the lieutenant feel about that ? " " Oh , Matt 's willing enough . He 's a bit ruffled , of  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a mistake has been made , which he wo n't admit , he 'd be foolish to persist in it . . . . But he 's so proud of his work on that case . " " Yes , " said Harriett , sadly , " I suppose he is . . Shall we get our bite here ? " " Any food looks good to a hungry man . " Harriett was wise enough to let him dull the edge of his appetite before pressing for the new facts . Then , with cigarettes alight and a second cup of coffee at a lanky elbow , she leaned forward . " Now , " she begged , " let 's have it . And do n't leave out a thing . " Wells shook his head . " Oh , no , " he said . " Not yet . Not until we go to the Grayson Building . There 's something there I want to see . " Harriett sighed resignedly , then , and was politely patient until Wells ' coffee was finished . During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pace , and the professor who kept up with her . He smiled at her eagerness . The afternoon was now nearly done . The streets were crowded with home-bound office-workers , and the lobby of the Grayson Building was a flurry of outward traffic which Harriett and Wells threaded dexterously . They rose quickly to the seventh floor and entered suite 719 with Harriett 's pass-key . Sam Peterson had gone , leaving the office neatly shut down for the night . Everything was in its place , orderly and clear . Wells ' first act was to glance quickly into the private  | room that had witnessed the death of Bond Grayson . He turned to Harriett : " Will you get someone up here with a crowbar or whatever they use to move a safe ? " " Safe ? What safe ? " " Women always want to know so much . The safe over there behind the desk . " Harriett spread her hands obediently and lifted the receiver from the telephone . Presently two colored porters came in , hearing a heavy iron bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " signalled Wells , leading them to the inner room . " I want this safe turned half-way around . Just move one end of it toward the desk . " The porters looked for confirmation from Harriett . Quite evidently they did n't intend to be moving safes for a stranger . But they saw her nod and began . They used the block of wood as a fulcrum for the bar , lifting one side of the safe slightly , turning it a bit and lowering it . A dozen times or more they did this before the safe had been half-swung about . " Could either of you two do that alone ? " asked Wells , during the slow swing . " Naw , sir , boss . Dat safe 's heavy , " answered one . " But with the two of you it 's easy enough , is n't it ? " The porter grinned widely . " Would n't want to do it all day long , boss . " " All right , then . . . that 's far enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone he leaned over to examine the back of the safe closely . Harriett , completely  | mystified , watched him and waited for an explanation . She saw him run his fingers inquiringly over the smooth surface . Then he straightened up and made a motion to her . " Get over there , " he said . " Get the reflection from the light on the back of the safe . . . . Now , what do you see ? " Harriett peered closely . " I see a string of round marks , " she said , " which look like holes that have been filled up . And down at the bottom one of the holes has been dug out and left open . " " You see correctly , young lady . What you are looking at is the work of a safe-cracker who took plenty of time on his job . That job took days and days , or maybe I should say nights and nights , and it 's only half-finished . . . . The empty hole is the one Mattingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it mean ? " The professor shrugged eloquently . " As far as it might be concerned with the murder of Mr. Grayson , I 'm sure I do n't know what it means . But someone wanted to get into that safe and did n't care how long it took , just so he got in . And he wanted to do it without leaving any marks , so he worked only on the back and filled the holes with blackened putty as he drilled them . Odd , is n't it ? " " Odd , yes . . . . It does n't make sense . " " It might make a good deal of sense , later . . . . This is one of the little things that our red-haired friend found , in his thoroughgoing way , and said nothing  | about  --  for publication . " Wells waved Harriett to a chair and took one himself . " Another thing that Mattingly turned up and kept between himself and his reports was that Dr. Appleby , despite his perfectly good explanation of his activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to be . " " Dr. Appleby ? " " Yes . That gentleman and scholar . That handsome brute . He 's head over heels in debt to various people , and he could have used the missing fifty thousand dollars very well . " " But being in debt is no crime . " " Of course it is n't . I simply give the fact for what it is worth , as an example of what our enterprising detective found out . It may mean nothing at all to us , and then again it may mean  --  a good deal . " " How could it ? " " Do n't ask me that . Give me an easier one . . . . All I 'm doing at present is gathering together in one lump all the variables in this long equation that we have to solve . Mattingly has made his calculations , using the evidence he wanted and throwing out the rest . He got a certain answer . The answer was that Oliver Grayson killed his uncle . What we must do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculations and show that he figured wrong . And to do that we must use more factors in our equation than he used . Otherwise we 'd get the same result . " " You think , then , that these holes in the safe and Dr. Appleby enter into the case somehow ? "  | " I have n't said that . All I say is , let 's get the data first and do our figuring afterward . . . . Now , point number three in Mattingly 's unrevealed documents is that your revered Mr. Richard Lee Marsh has not the slenderest , slightest alibi for that fatal Wednesday evening in July . " Harriett was genuinely astonished . " Mr. Marsh ? Why should anyone think of connecting him with this ? He was Mr. Grayson 's friend  --  his closest friend . It 's utterly " There , now , " soothed the professor . " You women always let your hearts rule your heads . Stop emotionalizing for a moment and think . " He grinned away any feeling in his words . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three points I 've mentioned during the week between Mr. Grayson 's death and your adored one 's unlucky day . He had all three points under active investigation , so he says , but dropped them after George Clark spilled the beans on young Grayson . After that , everything became so simple  --  to Mattingly  --  that no real work was done on anything . If any one of these three points means anything at all , we must dig up the facts ourselves . Officially speaking , neither Mattingly nor the Commissioner is interested . Their books are closed . . . . Now , " mused Wells , " of the three points , which shall we take up first ? " " Does n't the safe seem most important ? " " I hardly think so , my dear . " " Dr. Appleby ? "  | " Oh , no . After all , an alibi is an alibi . He really was at home that evening , you know . " " Surely you do n't mean ? " " Of course I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only logical . " " But  --  why ? " " Mainly , I suppose , because two of the one-thousand-dollar notes that seemed to be concerned in this case were found in Mr. Marsh 's pocket . " 2 . Harriett stared unbelievingly at Wells , who was absent-mindedly shooting his quarter up his sleeve . " Oh , yes , " he said . " It 's true enough . Two of the one-grand notes . Came from Marsh 's pocket . He had an explanation for them , of course , but there they were . " " How did he account for them ? " asked the bewildered girl . " His story was very simple  --  and very hard to prove or disprove . He says he received them in the mail . He showed Mattingly the envelope they came in . Marsh 's name and address were typewritten . He got the letter ? or claims he did  --  on the Friday after the murder . There was no message . Only the two notes wrapped in a plain piece of paper . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the first and last in the bundle Sam Peterson had gotten from the bank . The lowest number and the highest on the list . . . . Interesting , is it not ? "  | Harriett frowned in perplexity . " What did Lieutenant Mattingly make of it ? " she asked . " Was he able to find out who had sent the money to Mr. Marsh ? " " Our titian-haired bloodhound knows no more about it than those gulls in the harbor . There 's nothing he could work on , he says . The paper was cheap and untraceable . There were no marks  --  no clear fingerprints except Marsh 's own . The typing failed to match samples taken from every machine in this building and in . Marsh 's own office . And there it stands . I have the envelope and paper here " ? he tapped the manila folder ? " and I 'll have a go at it myself when I get to the laboratory . " " Will you tell me , please , " said Harriett thoughtfully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't we have known of this sooner ? It might have been followed up then , but what chance is there now ? " " The only chance is as good now , I think , as it ever was . And I think I 'd just as soon know why it was sent as who sent it . . . . Mattingly says , with some reason , that it could have been sent by Oliver Grayson in an attempt to bewilder the investigation by throwing suspicion on Marsh . " " Impossible , " said Harriett . Wells wagged an admonishing finger . " Logic , my dear , not emotion . . . . It is possible , even if unlikely . Matt freely admits that he would n't have been able to prove a thing regarding that money against young Grayson , but it would have made a spectacular and damaging point in court in the hands of Ross Colgate.  | . . . Anyway , it was n't used . Matt is probably right in saying the letter is untraceable , so let 's assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuck down in our equation this riddle : Why did the first and last notes in the sequence appear and not the others ? " While propounding this question the professor 's eyes closed in a veritable cloud of concentration . Harriett said something ; he gave no sign that he heard . He sat on a corner of the murdered man 's desk and let his bright coin lay still for the moment . Then he held up a questioning finger . " Tell me something . How much money did Peterson get for Mr. Grayson that day ? It was mentioned in your young man 's story . " " Fifty thousand and fifty dollars , " said Harriett promptly . " That 's it ! find fifty dollars ! In ones , were they not , and new bills , with consecutive numbers ? " " They were . " " Yes , of course . " Wells rose with an abrupt gesture . " We have progressed , my dear , " he said . " Have we , Mr. Wells ? " Harriett was plaintive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you do n't mind , we 'll take a little ride , " said the professor . " We 're going to call on a gentleman by the name of Pokarny . Joe Pokarny . We should find him home about this time of day . " " Who might he be , Mr. Wells ? "  | Clifford Wells could be quite deaf when his thinkingcap was on . He did not reply . Instead he picked up his hat and led off . Harriett followed meekly , after locking the office door . The name meant nothing to her until she heard Wells give the address to the taxi driver . Scott Street . Then a vague remembrance came . " Is n't our Mr. Pokarny the man with whom John Blann lived ? " she asked . Wells nodded and puffed on his pipe . " That 's the man , " he answered , staring absently ahead . " Then you think John Blann is tied up in this thing some way ? " " I have n't the slightest doubt of it . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was he started to tell your young man on the telephone that day . I think it would prove interesting . " " I  --  I have a theory about that , Mr. Wells , " said Harriett . " Theory ? " he said , turning toward her . " Good . Let 's hear it . After all , you 've had several months to think about all this , to my several hours . " " Well , how about this ? John Blann took that fifty thousand dollars  --  or rather , fifty thousand and fifty ? from Mr. Grayson 's safe before he called the police that night , and then later on he learned about the reward that was being offered and tried to confess in order to earn it . " " You mean he tried to earn an honest ten thousand by giving up a dishonest fifty thousand ? "  | " Well , yes . That 's what I mean . " A frown , a dozen puffs at the pipe and a shake of the head . " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why not ? Why wo n't it do ? " Harriett was quite bravely defensive , in spite of knowing very well that if Wells said so , it probably would n't do . " For a number of reasons . . . . First , the mere confession of having taken the money would have done nothing toward clearing up the murder , provided Blann himself had n't killed Mr. Grayson . Therefore Blann would not have been earning an honest ten thousand at all . . . . Next , Blann might easily have taken the money from the safe , I suppose , but why should he then give it up ? He had some information to give that he thought would give him the reward . He said that on the ' phone , and Mattingly heard him . Whatever he had to tell was more than confessing he had stolen the money . It was  --  it must have been  --  about something he heard or saw or knew that night . He could tell what he had to tell , collect the reward if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original fifty thousand if he had it . . . . If he had it . See ? " , Harriett saw . " Furthermore , " continued Wells , warming to his subject , " the mysterious appearance of those two bills that Marsh claims to have received in the mail seems to wrap your theory up and throw it in the sewer . " Harriett would have asked " Why ? " but an expressively gestured hand prevented her . " The fact , my dear , that  | those two bills were the lowest and highest on the list of serial numbers is no mere coincidence , take it from your Uncle Cliff . No . There was a reason for that . And I think  --  I think  --  if we knew that reason , your young man would go free . " " Oh , " breathed Harriett at the thought . " Oh . " " However , " said Wells , opening the door of the cab , " here we are . Chez Pokarny . Will you alight ? "  | CHAPTER III @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It sagged . The decrepit front gate in the decrepit low fence led to a weathered , paintless frame building with roof , shutters , porch and steps all sagging together in dismal agreement . About the house there was an air of resigned submission to repeated blows which beat it slowly to earth , as if knowing that before long it would crumble down completely . It stood alone . The nearest structure , barely discernible in the half-light of evening , was one of a series of huge , brilliantly white gasoline storage tanks several hundred feet away . Beyond them the tall , hideous mechanisms of an oil refinery stood like sentinels . A pungent , unpleasant odor of petroleum and its derivatives pervaded the neighborhood . It was , most definitely , not a dainty place . " A beautiful spot for a murder , " said the professor , as he yanked the old-fashioned bell-pull . Oddly enough , the bell rang . It seemed strange that in this decay of a house anything at all should perform its function so capably . Slow shuffling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened creakily and showed a ca-  | daverous , unshaven face of uncertain but advanced age . Two questioning eyes peered out . " Well , what is it ? " " My name is Wells , and this is Miss Fleming . May I we come in for a moment ? " " What for ? " Pokarny was suspiciously alert . " It 's about John Blann . " " Oh , they found him , did they ? Now mebbe I 'll git the week 's rent he owes me . " " No , they have n't found him . " Pokarny was visibly disappointed . " We want to try to find him , and we need your help . " " What can I do ? " " Show us around the house , and answer a question or two . " " What about my rent ? Will you pay that ? " Wells looked at Harriett and saw her nod . " Yes , " he said . " We 'll pay it . " At that the door was thrown wide open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sudden and complete satisfaction . " Well , " he said . " Co-o-o-me on in . . . . Now , what d'ye want t ' see first ? " " The telephone , " said Wells promptly . " Got none . " " Got none ? Did n't I see a telephone line coming into this house from a pole on the road ? " " Yep , guess you did . But ne'theless , got none . Been taken out since Blann skipped out on me . The comp'ny he worked for used t ' pay for it , on account they might  | have to call him if the other watchman did n't show up . But the outside line 's still there . " " I see . . . . Well , show us where the ' phone was before it was taken out . " " Sure . " Pokarny led them through a bleak hall to what was meant to be a kitchen . He pointed to a dirty wall , which was quite innocent of any decoration except its grime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor gave a cursory glance about the room and turned to its owner . " Where were you , " he asked , " on the day John Blann disappeared ? " " Right here . " " All day ? " " All day . But I was sleepin ' most o ' th ' time . I got a night job , too . Watchin ' . " " So you 're a watchman , too ? Birds of a feather , is that it ? " Pokarny looked blank . " Did you see Blann at all that day ? " " Yep . Saw him when he come from th ' inquest , and got out o ' my bed t ' talk to him about it . " " Was he in good spirits ? " " Not much . He was in damn poor spirits , if you ask me  --  beggin ' your pardon , miss . He acted like he did n't want t ' talk t ' me . I thought mebbe he was worried about losin ' his job . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good guess , mister . I did . "  | " And left him alone downstairs , reading his newspaper . " Pokarny 's eyes grew big . " How did you know that ? " " Still guessing . After that , what happened ? " " Nothin ' happened . I went back t ' bed an ' slep ' till four o'clock . Then I got up an ' put on my clothes an ' went downstairs . Blann was gone an ' I ai n't seen him since . An ' I 'd only been up a little while when th ' cops come an ' started askin ' questions . That 's all I know . " " Except - that you heard someone come in to see Blann while you were in bed , " suggested Wells . " If I did , this is th ' first I know about it . When I sleep , mister , I sleep , unless I 'm listenin ' for somethin ' . Noise do n't bother me none . Even them guys diggin ' a ditch right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ditch ? What ditch ? " " Th ' refinery was puttin ' in a new pipe line right across my land . They was n't workin ' that day , though , or I might ' a ' woke up . . . . What 'd you like t ' see now ? " " Might as well go through the rest of the house , I suppose , " said Wells . " Show us Blann 's room first . " The room  --  like the entire house  --  was barely and poorly furnished , and showed nothing that made Wells delay for more than two seconds in his tour . He sighed and shrugged at Harriett . " Want t ' go outside ? " Pokarny evidently desired to give service for his rent money . " I suppose so , just to be thorough . "  | The outside was no more interesting than the inside . Weeds grew high and thick and rank except for a single wide streak running diagonally across the lot , which was nearly bare of undergrowth . Pokarny pointed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ditch he had mentioned . " They paid me a hundred dollars fer that , " he said , " just so I 'd let ' em cross my land . Easiest money I ever made . " The subject seemed to please him , and he proceeded to elaborate upon it . " Did n't have t ' do nothin ' at all . They sent a gang o ' men t ' do th ' diggin ' an ' all I did was take th ' money . Needed it , too , with Blann pullin ' out an ' owin ' me a week 's rent . " That , thought Wells , was a rather broad hint , but he pulled his billfold from his pocket cheerfully . " How much was it ? " " Three  --  I mean five dollars . " " Here you are . Three for the rent and two for luck . That right ? " " Thanks , mister . Thanks very much . " Pokarny tucked the money away gleefully and waved Harriett and the professor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wells did not answer her directly . He toyed with the change in his vest pocket  --  as though tempted to do a bit of coin-tossing  --  and said : " Are you at all superstitious ? " " A little . Why ? " " I 'm not , generally . But I gave friend Pokarny an extra two dollars and said it was for luck . And now I 've  | had the wildest , weirdest kind of a hunch . If I were a betting man . . . " His voice trailed off musingly . " If you were a betting man , what ? " He pondered . " If I were a betting man , " he said , slowly , " I 'd almost be tempted to play my hunch through , on the strength of those two bucks . " " I have n't the faintest idea what you 're talking about , " said Harriett , " but whatever it is , why do n't you do it ? " Wells snapped his fingers decisively . " I will . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " I 'll do it if it makes Matt 's men dig for a week . " " Dig ? " Dig ? " Yes , dig . " 2 . Blann 's strangled body was found the next morning . It lay five feet below the surface of the ground , buried close to the house in the fill about the pipe line . The professor , intent on other things at Bond Grayson 's desk , did not seem to be greatly surprised when Mattingly ' phoned in the news . " That 's great , Matt , " he had said . " Might as well hold the details until you get here and spill the whole thing then . " And he had hung up politely on an excited splutter and then called Harriett in from the outer office . " Lieutenant Mattingly will soon be here , Miss Fleming , with some good news . Meanwhile " Meanwhile , nothing ! What is it ? " " Blann 's body was found this morning . In the ditch , "  | " Body ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , " said Harriett , sadly . " I 'm so sorry . " " You should n't be , my dear , " said Wells , stuffing tobacco into his pipe . " You should be glad . " " You mean ? " I mean that this is the first definite knowledge we have that someone besides Oliver Grayson must be involved in this mess . I 'm assuming , of course , that Blann was killed when we think he was . If he was murdered while talking to young Grayson on the telephone , it 's clear enough . On the other hand , if we are mistaken , and Blann was killed some time later " " Never mind about that , " said Harriett firmly . " Oliver Grayson did n't kill John Blann any more than he killed his uncle . " Wells shrugged and lit his pipe . " We ca n't shut our eyes to possibilities , " he said . " No , but we can distinguish between possibilities and impossibilities . " Wells shrugged again and reached for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain page . " Meanwhile , " he said , " tell me , if you can , who this description might fit : In the list of people who were in the building the night of the murder , who would be wearing dirty white shoes and a crumpled linen suit ? " Harriett became thoughtful . " That list , " she said , " would include whom , precisely ? " " To our knowledge , there were six people here :  | John Blann , Johnson , the elevator operator , Spurrier from the ninth floor , Barton from the tenth , Flick from the fourth , and your beloved Oliver Grayson . The man I want would be a large man , I think , and not particularly active . Now , who would it be ? " " Mr. Barton , " said Harriett , promptly . " It could be no one else . Blann and Johnson would be in gray uniforms , and wearing black shoes . Mr. Spurrier is far too neat in his dress to be considered , and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could walk on eggs without cracking them . " " And Oliver Grayson ? " " How could it be ? You want to find out who it was that came down the stairs while Oliver was watching for a chance to get out unseen , do n't you ? Could anyone come down upon himself ? " " You 're far too brilliant this morning , my dear . Anyway , you must be wrong . " " I 'm not wrong , if your list is complete . " " That , of course , is the question . But taking it for granted that our list is complete , your deduction about Barton is entirely wrong . " " Why ? " " Because Barton was on the first floor at the time . He was probably off in a corner somewhere , out of sight , snoozing drunkenly . He told Mattingly , according to Oliver Grayson 's story , that he came downstairs , sent Blann out for more liquor , and stayed downstairs while he finished it . Mattingly told me in the Commissioner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor in the morning . It would take even a drinker like Barton some little time to add a pint to his waterlogged system , so I think we can safely say that it was not Alexander Barton who made Oliver Grayson run past Blann that night . " " Then who was it ? " Wells looked at her and puffed hard on his pipe , with his fingers tapping a rhythmic tattoo on the bowl . Then he said : " I 'm not very good at riddles this morning . You know who it was about as well as I do , which is not at all . " And he scowled engagingly at her . A short time later Mattingly strode in , looking somewhat disheveled and more than a little crestfallen . He sighed and sat down . " Well , " he said , " looks like you were right , after all , Professor . Get hunches like that often ? " " Not often enough , Matt . . . . Too bad you did n't figure it out for yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrong man . " Mattingly lit a cigarette and inhaled deeply , thoughtfully . " I do n't see how , " he said . " Maybe you do , but I do n't . I admit I should have thought of digging into that ditch before . . . but now that we 've found Blann , what does it mean ? " Wells flipped a quarter resoundingly against the ceiling . " Another riddle . Everyone is making riddles this morning . First the young lady and now the lieutenant . And you 're worse than she is , Matt . You ask riddles without giving facts . What did you find , my red-haired friend ? "  | Mattingly reached triumphantly into an inside pocket . " Only this , " he said , and threw a twinewrapped paper package to the broad desk . He stood waiting for the professor to open it , which the professor did not do . Instead , he grunted : " That 's the rest of the money , I suppose . " Mattingly 's jaw fell . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I expected it . And I 'd have been very much disappointed if you had n't found it . . . . Was there anything else ? " " No , damn it . " " Tut , tut . What did you expect ? A picture of the murderer ? " Mattingly threw his cigarette into the waste-basketfortunately empty  --  and leaned forward . " This is n't a riddle , now , " he said , " but do you think that whoever bumped off Blann might have killed Mr. Grayson , too ? " Wells looked up sharply at the question , and then smiled at Harriett . " We have made progress this morning . Here is our lieutenant practically admitting that he 's not so sure who killed your boss . Yesterday he was sure . Today he 's not . Progress . " Harriett nodded tremulously . " But , " continued the professor , " to answer your question , Matt , I 'm not at all certain myself , but I think I soon shall be . " " How ? " asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work first . . . . Harriett , will you get for me , please , all the night admission slips for two months or so before the murder , and a list of the nights that John Blann was on duty during the same period ? " Harriett hurried away at once , returning shortly with a pile of small forms and a pay-roll book . " Blann worked every night except Tuesdays , " she said , glancing into the book , " and was off sick on June the tenth . His last missed day before that was back in January . " " Fine , " said Wells , making appropriate notes . " Now , we 'll take our night slips and sort out from them all those involving the people we know were in the building that night , which means Spurrier , Barton and Flick . We 'll each take a pile . " The chore , divided into three , was quickly done . Wells gathered the selected slips together and went through them rapidly and with intense absorption . After several minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mattingly with a little grin of satisfaction . " The puzzle , " he said , " begins to fit  --  in one little corner . " " What 's doing ? " Mattingly wanted to know . " Quite a bit , my lad . . . . Do you happen to have any handcuffs with you ? " 3 . " Not me , " said Mattingly . " I never carry handcuffs . " He spoke as if to imply that such crudities were  | beneath him . " But what do you want cuffs for ? Who 's your man ? " " Listen to the story first , " directed Wells , settling back . " When that money was found in Blann 's pocket " The whole forty-eight thousand ? " broke in Harriett . " Yes , Miss Fleming , " said Mattingly . " Then he did steal it from the safe ! " " Very likely , " said Wells . " But he did n't mail the other two thousand to Marsh . That 's certain , and I want you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his dissertation : " By finding the money in Blann 's pocket we know that whoever killed him must have been either entirely unaware of the money or in such an extreme hurry that he could n't take a second or two to go through his pockets . Now it hardly seems reasonable that if the money were the thing behind Blann 's murder it would have been overlooked when it was so easy to find , or that the two seconds could not have been taken to get the money after the half-minute or more necessary to strangle Blann . " Therefore I think Blann was killed for an entirely different reason , and his body disposed of in the simplest and most efficient way possible  --  by tumbling it into the open ditch outside the kitchen door and throwing a few spadefuls of dirt on top of it . You 'll remember , Miss Fleming , that friend Pokarny said the ditch-diggers were not working that day . . . . It was so simple and efficient that it even fooled Lieutenant  | Mattingly . " Mattingly reddened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette hanging forgotten between his fingers . " Then , " continued Wells , " it follows logically that since the bundle of money was not the root of this particular evil , it must have been something else altogether which led to Blann 's death . Blann had called young Grayson that day to tell him about it , whatever it was ; to tell him of something that he thought was connected with the murder of Mr. Grayson . Blann fully expected to earn the reward that was being offered . . . . And as he began to give his information , he was strangled . " The strangler , whoever he might be , has plenty of nerve , but that seems to be the only thing we know about him , actually . I reasoned , however , that from what Blann said on the telephone before he was killed , there was something he wanted to confess and be forgiven for . What else could that be except the work being done on the back of this safe ? Blann could not have done it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took two strong negro porters to move it for me . But , he could have helped someone else move it , and I think he did . " Blann was in on this safe-cracking job , and had reason to think his confederate had killed Bond Grayson . That 's what he had to tell . That 's how he expected to get the reward . . . . Or am I talking in riddles , too ? " " No . Please go on , " breathed Harriett .  | " Who is this guy ? " Mattingly asked , half rising from his chair . But Clifford Wells was not to be hurried . " You made an inventory of the contents of the safe , Matt , " he said . " Suppose you tell us , first , what he wanted to get at . " " Why , do n't you know ? " Mattingly seemed astonished . " I thought sure you had that figured out , too . " " Have n't the faintest idea . You tell me . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the will in one of the drawers " That 's a thought , " mused Wells . " ? and a lot of odd papers and stock certificates and account-books that did n't seem to mean much , and  --  oh , now I know ! " " Let 's have it , Matt . " " Open up the safe , Professor , " said Mattingly excitedly . " I 'll show you . " " You open it . I 'm rusty at safe-cracking . " " I 'll call Mr. Peterson , " said Harriett , rising . " He knows the combination . " She went to the outer office . " So Mr. Peterson knows the combination , " said the professor , gazing out over the harbor . It was child 's play to the old man 's fingers . He obligingly swung the door wide and retreated a step respectfully . " Now , Matt , " said Wells , " do your stuff . " Mattingly reached quickly to a narrow open shelf and extracted a folded , letter-sized sheet . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of combina-  | tions to the building safes . We supply all our tenants with safes , you see , and set the combinations ourselves . " " That 's my job , " said Sam Peterson . " No one else does it . " " Suppose you 're not here . Who does it then ? " asked the professor " A man from the safe company . But he charges three dollars . " " So to save three dollars , Mr. Grayson took this responsibility on himself and on you ? " Sam Peterson shrugged " Mr Grayson was a good manager . He did n't like to pay out money when it could be avoided . " Wells took the list and tapped the desk with it . " Who would know this list was here ? " he asked . " Probably everyone in the building , " replied the old man . " Tenants come in every once in a while to have their safes unlocked . They forget the combination . They see me get the list out to check up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been no secret , but it was a bad habit . " " Then , " said Mattingly , " you think I 'm right for a change ? You think that 's what our man was after ? " " Yes , Matt , I do . I think you 're right . . . . There 's no wonder our safe-cracker was so careful and so patient . By opening this one safe he was getting the keys to fifty others . One grand haul over some weekend and he and Blann were fixed . . . . Too bad , in a way , he was interrupted . All his work for nothing . "  | " And where does it lead us ? " insisted Mattingly . " Who is this other man ? " Wells picked up the night slips and riffled through them . " This chap , " he mused leisurely , " would probably be someone known to Johnson , the elevator operator , because it would have been dangerous to try to sneak in and out night after night . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this thing too . . . . Therefore , the night slips would show this man 's name . More than that , they would show his name only on those nights that Blann was working and was here to help him move the safe . Consequently it would have to be someone  --  probably a tenant in the building  --  who came here night after night and yet never came when Blann was off duty . Simple , is n't it ? " " Good God ! " exploded Mattingly . " Name the man , will you ? " The professor was tantalizingly slow . He glanced over the slips once more and studied his penciled notes . Then he said : " See what the tenant in room 410 has to say in his own defense . Henry Flick . Bring him up , Matt . " But Sam Peterson provided an anticlimax that Wells had not expected . " You wo n't find him there , Lieutenant , " he said . " He 's gone . " " Gone ? Gone where ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shrugged .  | CHAPTER IV I. THE professor did not show his disappointment . He simply looked questioningly at Mattingly . " We 'll get him , " said the lieutenant . " We 'll get him all right . We 've got a good description and a full set of his fingerprints . Sooner or later " Oh , no , " said Harriett , with a gasp . " It must be soon ! Do n't you see ? " Mattingly nodded and rose . " I 'll do my best . Anything more , Professor ? If not , I 'll get started on this . " Wells waved good-bye and reached disconsolately for his pipe . Sam Peterson went out , too , to give Mattingly what information he could . " I can see , " the professor said , " a good deal of similarity in trying to find friend Flick and trying to find that letter young Grayson lost . One is about as likely as the other . " Harriett said : " About that letter  --  do n't you think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go over the whole section inch by inch ? " " Who 'd pay the bill ? Oliver Grayson ca n't . He is n't permitted to touch a penny of his uncle 's money . It 's held up by the Orphans ' Court . . . . How about Marsh ? Is he wealthy ? "  | " Moderately so , I think . And he was left something ny Mr. Grayson too , you know . " " Right you are . " Wells sat up straight and looked at Harriett queerly . " Let 's have him in . There are some things I want to ask him , anyway . " Harriett made the telephone call from where she sat . " He 'll be right over . " " Good . . . . Now , let 's see how the morning light is . " The professor stared out each window , in turn , observantly . " Morning light ? " " Yes , my dear . Oh , by the way , do you mind if I call you Harry ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you had been born twenty years earlier you would probably have been called Hatty , which just goes to prove that the world is improving , after all . " " Will you stop gabbling and tell me what you 're doing ? " " I 'm preparing to take some photographs . This is a tripod . That is a camera . These are film-plates . I set the tripod thus . . . and put the camera . . . on . . . thus , and " Photographs of what ? " The professor waved airily . " Oh , " he said , " the scenery . But about that name I ) " Of course , if you want to . But " I do want to . Want to very much . . . . Are you going to marry Oliver Grayson , if  --  that is , if ? " If you prove he 's innocent , and set him free ? Is that what you mean ? "  | " Well , yes . Are you ? " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " " Suppose he did ask you . Would you ? " " I  --  I think so . Only " " Only what ? " " Only the money makes things so queer , so  --  mixed up . It would be much better if he did n't have it . " " Better ? " Harriett straightened up and heaved a sigh . " How did we get on this subject , anyway ? Tell me about these pictures . Will they be of boats in the harbor or interesting shots of city roofs ? " " Both , Harry . And I hope one of the two will indude whatever it was that Mr. Grayson was watching with his opera-glasses that night . " it " Oh , " said Harriett . " Oh , I see . You  --  you do n't leave anything undone , do you ? " She spoke with more than a trace of appreciative admiration . " No . Not if I can help it . I 'm doing all I can to send the gal into the arms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after . " The professor , bending down over the lens , had his face hidden from Harriett , but she knew all at once that there was less jest in his voice than in his words . " Oh , " she said again , and suddenly wanted to do something  --  anything  --  to make him look at her . But he would n't . He continued his preparations with careful , polite aloofness . He shifted the tripod and camera into position behind the big desk , after sliding the chair out of  | the way , and studied the image of western and southern views on the ground-glass . Then , satisfied , he inserted his plates and made the exposures . " There 's an odd thing , too , " he said , as though there had been nothing in his mind for hours except consideration of the case at hand , " the glasses have never been found . You 're certain that 's what he had on his desk , are n't you , Harry ? " " Quite certain , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were so small that when he put his hand down to hide them  --  I 'm sure that 's what he wanted to do  --  I could n't tell he had anything there at all . " " But he had very large hands . " " Yes , Mr. Literal . He had very large hands . " " So " Whatever Wells had intended to say could not have mattered , for he permitted the entrance of Mr. Richard Lee Marsh to interrupt him . " Good morning , Harriett . " " Good morning , Mr. Marsh . This is Professor Wells , of Johns Hopkins . He is going to do what he can to help Oliver . " " I 've heard of you , sir , " said Marsh , beaming . " It 's very reassuring to have someone like you to help the boy , if he can be helped . " Wells sucked his pipe and looked up lazily . " Do n't you think he can be helped ? " Marsh was instantly apologetic . " I did n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most crudely . What I meant was that so far we 've been entirely unable to turn  | up anything to give us a start in the right direction . The police , of course , have n't been willing to do much for us beyond standing aside and allowing us to try to get somewhere . But it has been most disheartening . " " But Mr. Wells , " said Harriett , " has already done more  --  in eighteen hours  --  than you and I did in two months . " " Splendid ! " cried Marsh , looking from one to the other . " What 's been done ? What have you found out ? " " Well , " said Harriett , and then she stopped . Wells , busily engaged in making his coin jump from finger to finger , had glanced up and told her , with a slight shake of the head , to hold her tongue . " What we 've found out so far , " he said , taking charge of things calmly , " is only a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object this morning is to increase that part if we can . Therefore " ? Wells was quite bland ? " would you mind , Mr. Marsh , telling us whatever you can of your own part in the case ? Tell us , if you will , about the making of that will on the day before the murder , and about the very valuable letter you received , and  --  well , everything you know . " " So , " said Marsh , flushing slightly . " That 's the way the wind blows , eh ? " Wells nodded . " No offense , I trust ? " " Oh , no . No offense . I can appreciate your position , Mr. Wells . You are somewhat of a fresh student on a problem that seems old to us , and you 're taking nothing for granted . Am I right ? "  | " You are , " said the professor . " Will you proceed ? " Marsh straightened up . " Gladly , " he said . " But there 's really very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office the night before he was murdered and asked me to witness his signature on a paper . He did n't say what the paper was , but I knew at once , after seeing the form in which the last line or two was written , that it was his will . That 's all I know about it . He had it all ready , written in longhand and copied for the most part  --  as I found out later  --  from the previous will I had prepared for him . " " What difference was there between the last will and the one before it ? " " There was only one important change . He had previously set aside a half-million dollars to be used for a children 's hospital , with Dr. Appleby in charge . That was for a permanent endowment . There was also to be , I think , a building fund of two hundred thousand dollars . That was cut out , too , and added to the share his nephew was to get . " " When was all this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening . " " And who was the other witness ? There are usually two , I believe . " " Yes , there were two . The other witness , strange as it may seem , was Trueman Appleby . " 2 . Harriett Fleming was oddly amused , beneath her  | complete bewilderment , at the aptness of the situation . Nothing could have illustrated the workings of Bond Grayson 's mind in its bitter humor than that the unsuspecting doctor should have put his own name to the document which would blast a sizeable fortune from his control . But why ? What was back of it ? The professor presumably was asking himself the same questions : " Did you know of the changes that night ? Did Mr. Grayson let you read over the will ? " " No , to both questions . I read the will for the first time when Lieutenant Mattingly handed it to me after I got to the building . " " Do you think Appleby knew what he was sign-ing ? " " I have no way of telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was asked to wait until Appleby came in , I know that Mr. Grayson did n't say anything to him about it then , at least . " " Let 's get on , " said Wells . " Tell us about the money . " " What is there to tell ? " asked Marsh . " Mr. Grayson was shot on Wednesday night . On the following Saturday I got a letter in the first morning delivery at my office . In it were two thousand-dollar bills . Judging by the postmark , it had been mailed on Friday , from somewhere in Baltimore . I was very much surprised , of course , and puzzled , and I kept it for a half-hour or more before I realized that in some way it was connected with the murder , Then I called Lieutenant Mat-  | tingly . That 's all I can tell you of my part  --  as you put it  --  in the case . " " Except ? " hinted Wells . " Except what , sir ? " " Except  --  you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the night of July nineteenth . You said yourself I was taking nothing for granted . " " Yes , it seems I did . " Marsh was human enough to gulp and hesitate . " I 'm very much in the same fix as Oliver when it comes to that night , because I ca n't prove a single thing I say . Nevertheless the fact is that I was walking myself tired from nine o'clock to about ten-thirty . You see , I have the bad luck of not being able to sleep very well . The only time I can be certain of a good night 's rest is when I 'm so fatigued that I ca n't stay awake . . . . That day had been so warm that I had n't been very active , and I was afraid I 'd lie awake all night if I did n't do something . Therefore I set out , about nine , and walked my legs off . Sounds silly , does n't it ? " " Silly enough to be true , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you stop to say a word to the policeman on the street-corner , or something like that ? " " I 'm not so lucky . I did n't . I kept going , got back home about ten-thirty or a little later , and tumbled into bed . And no sooner had I gotten into a beautiful , beautiful slumber than the telephone rang . A gentleman named Mattingly was requesting my presence down here . I ask you , now , is that irony or is n't it ? " " It would have been less so if you had chosen some  | other direction for your walk than the one you did . Why did you come down here that night ? " " Oh , but I did n't ! I was n't in the building until nearly midnight ! " " No , " soothed Wells . " I do n't mean in the building . I mean near it . I understand from Lieutenant Mattingly that your walk took you all around the downtown district . Is that correct ? " " Yes , damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever you want , but I had to walk right here near the thick of things  --  right into the middle of the murder while it was going on  --  and then out again . Just near enough to make you and Mattingly wonder about me , but not near enough that I could have seen or heard anything of what went on . . . . That 's my story , Mr. Wells , and I stick to it . " Then , as an afterthought , he added : " Look at it this way , too . I could very easily have said that I walked northward from my home that night , and no one would have been the wiser . So give inc credit for telling the truth even if it hurts . " " Of course , " said Wells , nodding . " The point is quite clear . Thank you so much for calling my attention to it . " Harriett thought that he might have been a bit less derisive . " And now , " went on Wells , " one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office ? " " In the Bannen Building . " " Will you point it out to me , please ? " asked the professor , waving toward the window . " You ca n't see it from here , " replied Marsh . " It 's  | behind the Fenway Building across the street . " He pointed westward to the red brick facade . Wells followed his direction and grunted . " Thanks , " he said . " That 's all I can think of . . . . I believe Harry  --  Miss Fleming  --  wants to talk to you about searching for that letter young Grayson says blew out of his train window . I 'm going out to the lab . " " But , " protested Harriett , " have n't you any suggestions about it ? You do n't seem to think it 's very important . " " Matter of fact , " said Wells , " I do n't . But look for it if you want . And I hope you find it . " With that he picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was gone . Gone for that day and the next .  | CHAPTER V 1 . THROUGHOUT the remainder of that day and the day following Harriett had no word from Clifford Wells . He may have gone to the laboratory but he did not remain there , for the most cultivated and polite voice of the university telephone operator informed Harriett patiently , a half-dozen or more times , that he was out . No , he had left no message . She would be glad to take a message for him . Call Miss Fleming ? Certainly . As soon as he returned . He was not at his dormitory room . Harriett could hear the buzz of the ringing ' phone . He was not at the Police Building . Lieutenant Mattingly was sorry . He 'd keep an eye open for him and have him get in touch with her . Was there anything he could do ? The lieutenant must have detected the urgency in her tone . Harriett had said , " No , there 's nothing you can do , " but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was handling the case now , not Mattingly . Harriett had said " No " and hung up . And she waited and waited , revolving the facts she had learned on the morning after Wells had gone , and becoming impatient to the point of desperation . That morning Harriett had had visitors . Two of them . Sam Peterson had gone out for an hour or more  | on business and left her alone in room 719 . She had glanced at the mail , saw nothing requiring immediate attention , and sat down to read the second installment of Oliver Grayson 's story in the Baltimore Sun . In the midst of it her visitors entered . They were Todd Spurrier and his wife . It was a strange-looking Todd Spurrier , for his clothes  --  always so neat  --  were disheveled , and he was red-eyed and unshaven . He came in apologetically , almost sheepishly , and stood twisting his hat about while his wife withered him with a downward look . She was taller than her tall husband , and broad and heavy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Do n't stand there with your mouth shut . " He obeyed . " Is  --  that is , Miss Fleming , I believe there 's a Professor Wells investigating Mr. Grayson 's murder ? " " Yes , Mr. Spurrier , there is . " " Could I see him ? " " He 's not here . I do n't know when he 'll be in . " " Well , there 's something I want to tell him . " " Oh , " said Harriett , " please , what is it ? Tell me ! " Spurrier looked up at his wife doubtfully . " Shall I , Daisy ? " Daisy snorted . " You better had . I do n't know what to make of you , Todd Spurrier . You see , Miss Flem-ing " This is my wife , Miss Fleming . " " How d' you do , Mrs. Spurrier. " " ? for two months I 've known something was wrong  | with my husband . He could n't eat , could n't sleep , could n't act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing was the matter with him . Snapped at the children like an old bear . I just told him flat he 'd have to see a doctor or I 'd carry him to see one . But he would n't and I did n't . My bark 's worse than my bite , I guess . " Anyway , up to yesterday morning I thought he was improving a little , but yesterday he was worse than ever . First thing that happened was , I caught him getting up at five o'clock in the morning and waiting on the front porch for the paper-boy to come along . He did n't know I was watching . What does he do but grab the paper out of the boy 's hand  --  I guess the kid thought he was crazy  --  and read the story that he knew was going to start that morning ? The story poor young Mr. Grayson wrote in the Penitentiary . And then he groans and walks back and forth in the parlor like he was losing his mind . " I did n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went back to bed without letting him see me . Then this morning the same thing happened , only this time he sat still and broke out in a sweat . And I walked right up to him . " You 're mixed up in that murder , are n't you ? ' I asked him . " He jumped like he was shot and tried to hide the paper . " Who , me ? ' he said . " Yes , you , ' I said . That 's what 's been eating you  | all this time . ' And after a while he had to admit it . And here he is . . . . Now it 's your turn to talk , Todd . Stop acting like a baby and go ahead . " " Please , " begged Harriett . Spurrier coughed and passed a nervous hand over his stubbly chin . " I did n't want to do that young fellow any harm , Miss Fleming , " he said , not meeting her eye , " but I 've got a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in this murder . Anyway , " he interposed , defensively , " it looked to me like they  --  they got the right man . I was at the trial every day and I did n't think what I had to say would help him at all . It did sort of worry me , and I guess I acted funny and could n't eat from thinking about it . But then when this story started to come out in the paper , it sounded so darned true that I  --  I was sorry I had n't told the police what I knew . " " But what was it ? " Harriett was nearly in tears with eagerness . Spurrier licked his lips and looked pleadingly at his wife , but she was merciless . " Go ahead , " she said firmly . " All right , Daisy . . . . I 'm the man Mr. Grayson was talking to that night , Miss Fleming . Just before he was killed . " Once he had started , Spurrier 's words came in a rush , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did n't have a thing to do with that murder , and I do n't know who did , exactly , but I admit I was in this room , talking to the old man from about nine-  | thirty to ten o'clock or a little after . Then I left him and went back to my office . You see , " he added quickly , " everything I told Lieutenant Mattingly was true  --  except I did n't mention being here . I went back to my office , cleared up my desk , and then went to meet Daisy at the movies . That 's all . " " That 's not all , Todd Spurrier , " said his wife , " and you know it ! Go on and tell the whole story , just like you told it to me this morning . If you do n't , I will . " " Yes , Daisy , " he said , abjectly . " I just meant that was all I actually did . But I was going " You 're stalling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Ambers , and the rest of it . " Harriett 's wonder mounted at that name . Mr. Ambers , she thought , would be Jordan Ambers , owner of a shipping firm with offices on the floor below . Here was an entirely new name in the case . She listened intently . " I do n't know whether you know it or not , " Spurrier said , " but Mr. Grayson was buying up the Ambers Line . " " I did n't know it , " said Harriett . " Did n't know he was even interested in it . " " I should n't think you did . About the only people who did know it were Mr. Grayson and myself  --  and maybe Mr. Ambers . Since April I 'd been buying up all the stock that was offered on the market , little by little , a few shares at a time . And by the first of July  --  a few weeks before the murder  --  all Mr. Grayson needed was another few hundred shares for complete control of the company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ambers Line ? " Spurrier shrugged . " He did n't say . All I knew was that he wanted it and meant to have it . You know how he was . " " Yes , I know . " " Well , we found those last shares hard to get . The stock had disappeared from the market . By Mr. Grayson 's instructions I put in a bid price of thirty dollars a share , where the last sale had been at twenty . That brought out another hundred shares or so but before I could get them they had been snapped up by another broker at thirty-five . I reported this to Mr. Grayson . " That , ' he said , would be Jordan Ambers , waking up at last . What 's to be done ? ' " I told him Ambers ' son had five hundred shares . I knew that , because I 'd bought it for him myself . " Will five hundred do it ? ' he asked me . " It will give you about eighty shares over fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then get it , ' he told me . I do n't care how , but get it . Pay anything up to fifty thousand dollars . ' So , " said Spurrier , waving his hands , " I got it . " " Fifty thousand , " breathed Harriett , thinking of a pile of money from John Blann 's pocket , and two mysterious bills in an envelope . " I got it , " went on Spurrier , " because I knew young Ambers for what he was  --  a thoroughly spoilt young man . The five hundred shares had been a Christmas present from his father . The boy showed his apprecia-  | tion by quarreling with him not long afterward and leaving home . I found out where he was  --  by asking some of his friends  --  and sent him a telegram . I offered him the full fifty thousand for his stock . I did n't take any chances . " I got an answer back right away . Sold . What 's it all about ? Will deliver in person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got a letter saying that the stock certificate was at his home and that he would arrive on July nineteenth to get it and deliver it to me . " " July nineteenth ! " cried Harriett . " The night of the murder . Yes . . . . He was careful to explain in his letter that he would n't want to take a chance of meeting his father , so he 'd prefer to meet me in my office late that evening , hand over the certificate , get the money and have it all over with . He wanted no delay . " I told the whole thing to Mr. Grayson , and he said he 'd stay here too , to finish up the deal himself . He said when I brought the certificate in he 'd hand over the cash . He was n't taking any chances either , you see . " " No , " said Harriett , " he would n't . But what happened ? " " Nothing happened . Ambers Junior was to come to my office . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watchman  --  the one who 's missing  --  that I was expecting a caller , and it would be all right to let him come up . But about nine-thirty my telephone rang . It was the boy . He said he would n't be able to make delivery that night . Would the next day be satisfactory ? I told him it ti  | would n't  --  that I was expecting the stock right away . I asked him what the difficulty was . He said , Oh , I 'll tell you tomorrow . ' Then he hung up on me . " The only thing I could do was to go down and tell Mr. Grayson about it . I was n't very eager to tell him , because the old man was a terror if things did n't go the way he wanted . " It was n't as bad as I expected . He just sat there and listened to what I said and then grunted . " Looks like a hold-up , ' he said . " How so ? ' I asked him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the crazy young fool has let his father find out what he was up to , and got himself in a jam . And Ambers would be smart enough to keep the stock in the family  --  one way or another  --  or try to make me pay so much for the stock I would n't want it . ' " But the stock 's already yours , ' I said . The boy accepted your offer , in writing . ' " It 's not mine until I get it , ' he said . If I have to sue for it , and let everybody know what I 'm doing , I do n't want it . It 'll be no good to me then . Not worth a nickel a share . ' " I do n't know what he meant by that , but he would n't explain . We talked for some little time after that . I think I remember hearing ten o'clock strike . Anyway , it was between ten and ten-fifteen when I left him  --  the last time I was ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did n't take the elevator . I only had two floors to go . And then , when I had started up the  | stairs , I heard someone walking up from the floor below . From the sixth floor. ? Spurrier paused , frowning , as if picturing the event in his mind , and then continued : " I think whoever it was must have heard me , too , for just as I stopped to listen , he stopped also . I leaned over the rail to see who it was but I could n't . I could only see his right side and arm . The man was standing like a statue , with one foot half-raised as if he had stopped it in mid-air when he heard me . " Harriett asked quickly : " Could you tell what sort of man he was ? Was he tall or short ; heavy or slender ? " Spurrier shook his head . " You 've got to remember , Miss Fleming , that I had no particular reason to expect what happened so soon after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people walking about the building that night . All I know is that he had on an old linen suit and had something shiny in his hand , wrapped in a handkerchief . " " Something shiny ? " " Something I had n't remembered at all until the other day . That 's what makes me feel so bad . I could only see the tiniest glimpse of something bright sticking out of the cloth , but I think now it was a revolver ! "  | CHAPTER VI I. HARRIETT , after the first frenzy of her impatience was over , found she could be patient , after all . There was no sense in losing her head , she decided . If Mr. Wells could not be reached , it was too bad . She would wait until he came . In the meantime she not only kept her head but she used it . She typed , as fully and literally as she could , Todd Spurrier 's story  --  minus the frills occasioned by his wife . And after that had been done and proofread by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solve the mystery of Bond Grayson 's death . By mid-afternoon she made a guess and thought she knew the answer . By bedtime she was certain . By morning of the next day she had a splitting headache from sleeplessness brought on by convincing herself , through half the night , that she could n't be wrong . And by nine o'clock of that morning , if Wells had not been in the office to stop her , she would have called Lieutenant Mattingly and gotten him all excited . But Wells was seated at Bond Grayson 's desk when she arrived for work . In one hand were the sheets she had typed and addressed to him in an envelope , and in the other was a coin which moved about disconcertingly in expert , careless fingers .  | " Good morning , Harry , " he said . " And how 's the detecting business this morning ? " " So , " she said , " you 're back . Was the fishing good ? " He smiled and shook his head . " Bad guess . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought I was sleuthing , but I see you 've run rings around me . " He tapped Harriett 's sheets admiringly . " This , " he said , " is a good job , even though it tells us only a few of the things we want to know . " Harriett , becoming very patient with him , said : " Have you read it all ? " " Oh , yes . I 've been here an hour or more . " " Then you must have realized the same thing it took me all day yesterday to see . " Wells frowned . " You mean that from this story Todd Spurrier told you 've decided who killed Mr. Grayson ? " " Yes , that 's what I mean . " " But " It 's all very clear , " said Harriett . " Mr. Alexander Barton did it , and I can prove it ! " " Well , now , " said the professor , " that 's very interesting . I 'd like to hear your proof . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and arrest Barton ? " Yes . " " No , I think not . Not yet , anyway . I 'd rather hear your proof first . " " Then you do n't think I 'm right ? "  | " Oh , I 'm quite certain you 're not . " Harriett stared . She knew that beneath his grin he was completely serious . She had learned , in three days of knowing him , that he was rarely otherwise . " Please do n't be offended , Harry , " he said . " You asked me and I told you . But I 'd still like to hear your reasons . " " Then if I tell you , will you play ball ? " " Meaning will I tell you why you 're wrong ? Of course I will , if I can . " " Well , then , here goes . . . . Alexander Barton is known to have been in the building that night . That 's item number one . Number two , he admits having traveled up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity in the world to fire the shot that killed Mr. Grayson . Number three , he was angry at Mr. Grayson because he had told Mr. Barton that unless he stopped his habit of roaming around the building drunkenly , and sometimes half-dressed , he would cancel his lease and throw him out . That would mean , of course , that Mr. Barton 's company would fire him immediately . " " Now there , " said Wells , sighing , " is a new one . Why does everyone hold back on information like that ? It never seems to come out willingly . It 's like drawing teeth to get the facts behind all this . . . . But do n't stop , Harry . Go right ahead . " " Item number four is about the dirty linen suit . Day before yesterday you asked me who would be wearing something like that . I told you Mr. Barton . You tried  | to prove some way that it had to be someone else . I do n't agree with you . I say it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Mr. Barton who was seen on the stairs by Mr. Spurrier . I say it was Mr. Barton carrying the revolver in a handkerchief . And I say he shot Mr. Grayson ! " " You 're saying a lot , " said Wells , grinning amiably , " but you 're proving darned little . That all you have ? " " Yes , except to say that regardless of the way he drinks at times , Alexander Barton is n't the mental wreck you might think . When he 's sober  --  oh , yes , he is , frequently  --  he can sell big machinery  --  steam-shovels and things  --  and he does it well . He would n't hold his job at all if he did n't produce . . So there you are . Unlimited opportunity , a motive that to his inflamed mind could easily be enough to make him commit murder , and on top of that , proof that he was there at the time , carrying a weapon . What more could you possibly ask for ? " " A good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I could ask for a great deal more . " The professor leaned back and placed the finger tips of his right hand , firmly and precisely , on the finger prints of his left , and then he talked with just as much firmness and precision : " You 're trying to make it far too simple , my dear . You leave too many things unanswered . I grant you that this tale of Spurrier 's is most interesting , and sheds light in some dark corners , but it does n't give us a bit of  | proof on the identity of the murderer . Spurrier might have seen a dozen men with everything from automatics to sawed-off blunderbusses in their hands , but it would n't mean that there was n't a thirteenth man around somewhere who did the dirty work . . . . Let 's assume for a minute that it was Barton on the stairs with a gun in his right hand , which I do n't believe to be true . Then according to your theory he would have waited a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor before proceeding . That right ? " " I suppose so , " said Harriett . " Then what ? " " Then Barton would have continued on to the seventh floor , entered this office , shot Mr. Grayson , dropped the gun to the floor , walked out and gone about his affairs . Is that what you want me to believe ? " " Yes . What about it ? What makes it so hard to swallow ? " " It just wo n't do , that 's all . " " Well , then , let 's have your version . " " My dear girl , I have no version . All I say is that Alexander Barton is no more of a murderer than he is a prohibitionist . . . . Barton was thoroughly tight that night . Matt said his men were almost knocked down by his breath when they found him later , in his office . Now , drunken men do n't stand with one foot in the air , as Spurrier said he saw . They do n't stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no man alive , whether drunk or sober , ever holds a gun ready for action in his right hand if he 's left-handed . Spurrier seemed to be rather definite that it was the right hand .  | . .. And Alexander Barton is left-handed . Or had n't you noticed ? " " How do you know he 's left-handed ? " demanded Harriett . She was not going to forsake her brain-child without a struggle . " I 'll give you three guesses , Harry . How would I know it ? How , for instance , can I tell that you are very pretty and brown-haired and just tall enough to come up to the bottom of my ear ? " " Which means , I suppose , " said she , " that you have talked with Barton . If so , why beat around the bush so , and especially , why get so personal ? " Wells shrugged and waved his hands expressively . " I like getting personal with you . I hope you do n't mind . It does things to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . But seriously , yes , I have talked with Barton  --  at his home . I thought he 'd be more at ease there than here . As a matter of fact , I 've talked with a good many people . George Clark , for instance . And Mary Janowski , the charwoman , and the policeman who was on duty around here that night and any number of others . I 've pried and peered into the most intimate souls of various good citizens . And what have I to show for it ? Nothing . Not even one decent Grade B , slightly shopworn clue . Tough , is n't it , for a whole day 's work ? " " Then , " said Harriett , suddenly repentant , " you did n't desert the cause yesterday after all , did you ? " " No , Harry , I did n't . Did you think I had ? " " I  --  I did n't know what to think , Mr. Wells . "  | " The front name , in case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortened to Cliff by impertinent people . Do you think you could remember it , or should I write it down for you ? " " Do you have these attacks often ? " " Only about once in a lifetime . Let 's hear you say it . " " We 're getting too far from the reservation , " said Harriett , briskly . " Let 's turn back . . . . You said I was trying to make this case too simple . Why do you say that ? " " Because it is n't simple at all , Harry . Consider these points : Why should Mr. Grayson be killed so soon after changing his will ? Is it a mere coincidence , or is it ? something else ? What was he watching for the night he was killed ? It must have been something outside the building , or he would n't have needed the opera-glasses ; but it must also have been something fairly close or he would have needed stronger glasses . Who killed John Blann ? Was the murder of John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or was it another coincidence ? Maybe , of course , it was neither . It may have been a necessity brought about by whatever Blann happened to discover that night . But , then , what did Blann discover ? You see , I 'm asking a good many questions . Do you think Alexander Barton could answer any of them ? Do you still think he 's a murderer as well as a drunkard ? " Harriett considered . Then : " No . I do n't . He  --  he 's not the man . "  | 3 . " Now you 're being reasonable , Harry , " said Wells , filling and lighting his pipe thoughtfully . Then he said : " But I have another question for you . This is one that worries me a good deal . You will remember from Grayson 's manuscript that it worried Mattingly for a while , too , but then he seems to have forgotten it . The question is : Why was Bond Grayson shot in the top of the head ? Answer that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Why , " asked Harriett , " should you put so much importance in that ? Is n't it quite possible that Mr. Grayson was sitting at his desk working with his head down when the shot was fired ? Possibly he did n't hear anyone enter the outer office , and simply fell forward when the bullet hit him . " Wells reached for the manila envelope which held Mattingly 's reports . " It wo n't do , " he said , selecting a closely-typed sheet and some photographs from the mass , " and here 's the reason . When I said Mattingly forgot the point , I did n't do him credit . He did let it drop after catching your young man , but before that he did an amazingly beautiful piece of deductive work , which , instead of helping him , merely puzzled him . And I 'll admit it puzzles me , too . " Before Mr. Grayson 's body was so much as touched , Mattingly had him photographed from several angles , and made very careful notes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  show very clearly the line taken by the bullet . It struck his head on the left  | side and glanced off , imbedding itself in the wall . Now Mattingly noticed that the bullet-wound was somewhat elongated and the upper edge was straight and clear of blood . He deduced , therefore , that an extension of the line of the wound out into the front office would show the exact flight of the bullet . Am I clear ? " " As crystal , " said Harriett quickly . " Go on . " " Then he allowed the body to be moved and went on to other things . But several days later , after the case showed no signs of opening up , he came back to this point and did some further experimenting . He wanted to find out just how far away the murderer was when the shot was fired . He found it out by building a rack on which the gun could be slid back and forth precisely on this line of flight he had sighted and marked . Now , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the door-casing . He marked off several square inches of area in these marks and had them counted under a lens , very carefully . Then he fired the gun , while it was fixed on this rack , shifting it about on this rack at each shot , and studied the powder-marks after each shot by tacking up cardboard squares on the door-frame . All this was on a Sunday afternoon when no one would be bothered by the shooting . By " But the bullets ? " asked Harriett . " Went into a basket packed with cotton waste . . . . By means of again counting the number of tiny powdermarks on the cards and comparing them with the density of the marks found on the door-frame , and having used identical cartridges in the same pistol , Mat-  | tingly says he knows within a foot or two the spot where the murderer stood when he fired the shot . Beautiful , is n't it ? " " Beautiful ? Well , maybe , " said Harriett in perplexity . " But  --  what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good does it do ? " Wells put a match to his cold pipe and puffed several times before continuing : " Here 's the answer : If we know the line and the distance , we put the two together and get the actual height from which the gun was fired . That 's what Mattingly was after . He knows that except in the movies , where they always shoot from the hip , revolvers are aimed by lining them up between the eye and the object aimed at . He wanted to get the height of the murderer . " " And what , " asked Harriett , " was his answer ? " Wells waved a hand airily . " Matt says five foot seven or eight , but I 'm not so sure . He may have been crouching a little when the shot was fired . At any rate , Flick is the only man mixed up in this who is that short , so there you are . " " Oh , " said Harriett , " but wait a minute , now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know just how high or how low Mr. Grayson 's head was above the desk ? A very small variation there would make a great deal of difference in the height of the pistol out beyond that door . " " Right , Harry ! " Wells beamed at her proudly . " Right you are ! But Mattingly did n't lose sight of that point , either . There was one thing he had noticed that  | made him go ahead with all that tedious business . When he first began to look into the question of the line of the bullet , he saw very readily that if Mr. Grayson had had his nose so much as six inches clear of the desk , the line of flight would have gone about eight feet above the point where the pistol was found on the floor . This struck him as being very queer . Something had to be wrong somewhere . Either the murderer was on a ladder , or the shot had been fired much closer than where the gun was found , or  --  or Mr. Grayson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk when he was shot . . . . Do you follow me , Harry ? " Harriett nodded without reply . " Therefore , " summed up the professor in his very best Q. E. D. manner , " since the murderer hardly climbed a ladder to bump the old fellow off , and since the powder-marks on the door show that the shot was fired from at least several feet beyond the doorway , it follows as surely as night follows day that Mr. Grayson 's head was down on his desk before the bullet struck him . . . . And what do you make of that ? " " Maybe he was sleeping , " Harriett suggested . " Do you think he went to sleep with that safe standing wide open ? " " Well , no , I do n't , exactly . . . . Maybe he had a heart attack . " " Yes . . . maybe . And maybe he was already dead . "  | CHAPTER VII 1 . " ANYWAY , " said Wells , rising , " be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a visit . " " Where ? " " To the Ambers Line on the floor below . " He rose briskly . " You want to see Mr. Ambers ? " " Precisely . I want to see Mr. Ambers . I 've seen everyone else in this case . Why should he be neglected ? " But they were not to go at once . The telephone shrilled . Harriett , answering , nodded to the professor . " It 's Lieutenant Mattingly , " she said . Wells took the instrument . " Yes , Matt , what is it ? . . . So ? . . . Give me the dope . . . . Yes . . . . Yes . Well , keep it quiet for a while , will you ? . . . Oh , you have ? Not so good , Matt . Wish you had n't done that . " Down went the receiver . " A break for us , " he said to Harriett . " Flick 's been caught . Will you tell me why all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even leave the State , and gets caught ? of all places  --  in Annapolis , cracking a safe . " " Has he admitted anything ? " " He says he knows something about the Grayson case , but he wo n't talk until he sees Mattingly . He 's un-  | doubtedly going to try to trade his information  --  whatever it is  --  for dropping the charges against him . Mattingly 's sending a man down for him . He 'll be here about three o'clock . Coming up on the W. B. and A. " " What was that you said about keeping it quiet ? " " I asked Matt to keep it out of the papers for a while until we knew what it was all about , but he says the newspaper boys already have it . They were in his office when the call came in . " " Why should you keep it out of the papers ? " Wells grinned and shrugged his wide shoulders . " Does n't make much difference , I suppose , except that if , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murderer killed Blann to close his mouth , why should n't he try to kill Flick for the same reason ? " " That 's a bit remote , is n't it ? " " Oh , quite . You might say extremely remote . Nevertheless , I wish Matt had held his tongue instead of wagging it like a dog 's tail . " " And I thought , " went on Harriett , " that you might have had an idea that Flick himself had murdered John Blann . Or did n't you ? " " I had n't made up my mind , " said Wells , moving toward the door . " Let 's go . " But they were still not to leave . Richard Lee Marsh , entering as they were at the door , took off his hat disconsolately and sat down with a sigh . " I 'm tired , " he said . " Then , " smiled Clifford Wells , " you wo n't have to walk yourself to sleep tonight . "  | " Me ? Hardly . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep for a month . And all for nothing . " " You mean you 've been looking for that letter ? " " That 's what I mean . I 've handed out money like a drunken sailor , getting men by the dozens to travel up and down that track . So far all they 've found has been junk . The stuff they 've brought me has n't been worth a plugged nickel . Their ideas of a small letter on white paper are amazing . " " Just to cheer you up , " said the professor , " I doubt if you 'd be able to read the letter if they should , by some remote chance , find it . " " You 're just a little Pollyanna this morning , eh ? .. . Well , what shall I do ? Keep on looking or quit ? " " You tell him , Harry , " said Wells . Harriett considered for some moments . Then she said : " Give it two more days , if you can afford it , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll know it ca n't be . " Marsh sighed again and reached for his hat . " I 'll get back up there in the morning , " he said . " But I refuse to take another step along that blasted railroad . I 've had enough walking to last me a long time . " And out he went , sighing once more , heavily , as he disappeared . 2 . On their third start Harriett and the professor succeeded in leaving the office without interruption . Har-  | riett locked the door behind them . This brought a thought to Wells : " What 's happened to Sam Peterson ? I have n't seen him this morning . " " He 's not well , Mr. W  --  Cliff , " said Harriett . " He has n't been in for two days . " " What 's his trouble ? " " Sciatica , I think . I talked to him on the ' phone yesterday and he said he felt pretty bad . I 'll try to see him today , if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you do . . . He 's wrapped up in his work here , is n't he ? " " It 's his whole life . I do n't know what Mr. Grayson would have done without him . He depended on Sam for a great many things . " " They got along well together ? " " Oh , yes . Anyone would get along with Sam . He 's ? he 's sweet . " " I see I have more competition . " " Do n't start that again . . . . Here we are . " " Will you lead the way , Harry ? " The main office of the Ambers Line was a large one and a busy one . There was a hum of smooth and efficient activity in the place , and an air that here no lost motion and wasted energy would be permitted . Wells felt that the man who ruled this office would be a man who dealt firmly , rigidly . The reception-clerk knew Harriett . " You want to see Mr. Ambers ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | The girl announced them and got a short reply . " Go right in , " she said . Jordan Ambers , meeting them at the door of his private office , seemed puzzled . " What 's the matter , Miss Fleming ? Has n't the rent been paid this month ? " Harriett smiled . " This is n't the sheriff , " she said . " I 'd like you to know Professor Wells , of Johns Hopkins . He 's doing some work concerning the  --  the death of Mr. Grayson . " " Oh , I see . . . . Well , come in , please . " The professor was quick to note the hesitancy and doubt that had come into the man 's voice and manner . It was as if Ambers , short and broad and forceful , had suddenly become wary . Wary of what ? " I 'm honored , indeed , " said Ambers , " but I fail to see your reason for coming to me . Is there anything I can do to help you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he and Harriett took proffered chairs . " You see , " he went on , " there are a good many details concerning Mr. Grayson 's affairs which may or may not have had a bearing on his death . You are , I think , familiar with some of those details , and I 'd like to hear what you know about them . " Ambers chose to pretend ignorance , Wells thought . He looked at his visitors in a rather good imitation of wonder . " I do n't understand , Mr. Wells , " he said . " What do you mean ? "  | " Come , now , " said Wells , blandly . " Let 's be frank about all this . " " Frank ? I know nothing at all to tell you . I have n't the faintest idea what you 're driving at . " " So ? . . Then tell me this : On the night of last July nineteenth , where were you and what were you doing ? " " July nineteenth ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to know what I was doing ? Why should you ask me that ? You think I had something to do with  --  with killing him ? " Wells shrugged . " Those who wo n't answer questions must take the consequences of having the answers guessed at . " Jordan Ambers licked his lips and stared . " And what have you guessed ? Tell me that ! " " I 've guessed , " said the professor calmly , " that you had a particularly good reason for wanting Bond Grayson 's death . It happened at a most opportune time for you . I 've guessed that you knew he would be at his desk that night . I 've guessed that it would be the simplest thing in the world for you to have shot him . I 've guessed that you , as a former sailor and ship-captainoh , I know a good deal about you  --  have had occasion to fight and fight hard in the past . You would n't be at all squeamish about turning under a man who stood squarely in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , and I 've told you . Now , what about it ? " Ambers , throughout this unruffled speech , had gripped the arms of his chair and leaned forward ,  | breathing noisily . His face suffused to a deep , choleric crimson , and his tongue passed continually over his dry lips . Then , when Wells had stopped , he slowly gained control of himself and relaxed slightly before he replied . " Tell me , " he said huskily . " Am I talking to  --  to the police , or to just a private snooper ? " " Consider me whatever you wish , " countered Wells , " but I 'd advise you , if my guesses are anywhere near correct , to say nothing and see a lawyer . If they 're not , go ahead and talk . You 'll have nothing to fear . " Ambers took a full minute to think it out . Then he straightened up . " All right , " he said , " I 'll talk . You 've guessed pretty well . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  buzzard , and I 'll admit I heaved a big sigh of relief when I heard he was dead . And I suppose I would n't have been squeamish about rubbing him out if I 'd wanted to bad enough . But the fact remains that I did n't shoot him . That 's one thing you 've guessed wrong . " " I 'd like to have something besides your bare statement , of course , " said Wells smoothly . " You want an alibi ? I 'd like to have a good one all ready , but  --  I have n't , I 'm sorry to say . " 3 . " Tell me , Mr. Ambers , why Bond Grayson wanted control of your company , " suggested Wells . " That 's simple . He knew a good thing when he saw  | it . He knew we were in line for a tie-up with the Blue Diamond Line , which will give us a much better South American service , and he knew , or guessed , that I had sold most of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back when it was low . How he ever got on to it I 'll never tell you . He had ways of finding out such things , I suppose . Anyway , when I started to buy my stock back I found he had a lot of it and was in a fair way to taking the company away from me . . . . It would n't have been so bad if he had n't used my own son against me to finish the deal . You can imagine how I felt when I found that out . " " Yes , " said the professor . " I can imagine . . . . You caught your runaway son trying to get his stock certificates from your desk at home  --  or wherever it was kept  --  and discovered what was going on . You learned that the stock was already sold by agreement , and only needed delivery to finish the transaction . You knew that if Grayson sued for the stock he 'd get it , even if you did prevent your son from handing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it " No , I did n't ! My son said the broker was waiting to get the stock . Spurrier . " " But you knew that your son had demanded cash , and you knew that with fifty thousand dollars changing hands Bond Grayson would n't be far away ! " Ambers swallowed hard and said nothing . " And you knew , " pressed Wells , " that the only way to save your company  --  which means to save yourself ? was to kill Bond Grayson ! "  | " Suppose I did know that ? What does it prove ? If you were going to be fired from Hopkins would you shoot the dean ? " " Probably , " said Wells , " and I 'd try to do as good a job as this one . Then I 'd never get caught . . . . Well , think it over , Mr. Ambers . If you happen to remember anything about that night  --  anything at all  - -  I 'll be in 719 . So long . Come on , Harry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the corridor he turned about . " Make a bet , " he said . " Money or marbles ? " " Bet that inside of , say , half an hour , he comes upstairs to see us . " " About what ? " " To clear himself , somehow . To provide us with a nice , home-grown alibi . Bet ? " " No . Not with you . . . . You have something on him ? " " Not a thing . But he 's a worried man , if I ever saw one . You noticed , I guess , that I did n't push him as hard as I might have done ? " " I noticed . Thought you were getting soft in your old age . " " Trick of the trade . Here 's the point : Whenever one of the high spots of this business of living happens , such as a bad accident or a wedding or a sudden illness or  --  or a murder  --  anything , I mean , that sticks up like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it  | never sticks up all by itself . It carries along with it the circumstances surrounding it . For instance , if you were getting married " Which I 'm not , " said Harriett , as she inserted her pass-key and led into room 719. " ? you 'd remember , later on , not only the business of the ceremony , but a lot of the little , meaningless details that happened . You 'd recall the dog that snapped at my heels as we left the church . You 'd " Whose heels ? " " Mine , I said . Just for illustration . Or you 'd remember just what it was you said to your girl friend as you stepped out in the way of a street-car . Or you 'd remember that you had a tuna-fish salad two hours before the fire broke out . See ? " " Which leads to what ? " asked Harriett . " Which leads to the fact that Jordan Ambers knows precisely where he was and what he was doing the night Bond Grayson was killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He admits it . It meant the difference between being president of the Ambers Line and running things his own way , or being a minority stockholder and taking orders . So  --  I give him a half-hour to make up his mind to come up and give us a watertight alibi . " " If he has a watertight alibi , why should n't he give it to us right away ? " Wells shook his head . " No , " he said , " that would be too blunt , too raw , for him . He thinks he 's cunning . He wants us to believe that he 's innocent as a baby .  | Being innocent , therefore , he naturally would n't have a defense all ready . He naturally would n't be able to say where he had been on a night two months ago . Only criminals have alibis all ready , ' says he to himself . " The telephone rang . Harriett , answering , almost popped her eyes out . She handed the receiver to Wells , speechlessly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Ambers ! Fancy hearing from you so soon . . . . What 's that ? . . . You say you attended a shipper 's conference that night ? . . . Just found the memo in your files ? . . . Well , is n't that just dandy ? " The receiver went down ever so gently . " So , " said Wells , fishing a quarter from his vest pocket and spinning it on the desk , " he 's running true to form . . . . Wonder just how much he knows about this mess . " And there the matter stood . Through an hour of thrashing about in the tantalizing , evanescent complexities of the facts they had , through a hurried lunch and a return to further thrashing , the case advanced not one single inch . And up to three o'clock in the afternoon the facts simply revolved about in maddening abstractness and laughed in the faces of the two who would put them in order . And at three o'clock Henry Flick was murdered .  | CHAPTER VIII @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour he lingered on in the thick folds of the descending curtain . He lay on an operating-table at Mercy Hospital , and was still as the table itself . Harriett was there , ready with notebook and pencil for the words that seemed never to come . Clifford Wells was there , and Mattingly , and a house physician and a nurse . The room was quiet to the point of making every breath audible . Harriett found herself unwilling to breathe for the uproar it made in the stillness . As she watched the pitiful slight form , ghastly in its deathlike rigidity , Harriett remembered that the professor had known this was to be ; had said so . What were his words ? " Flick knew what Blann knew . The murderer closed Blann 's mouth . Why not Flick 's , too ? " It was done . That thin-lipped , wryly grinning mouth was closed . True , there was still the slightest speck of life within his body , but by how slender a thread did it hang ? Before it faded out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind this deviltry ? The surgeon  --  young and quite callous  --  picked up one sagging wrist and felt for its faint pulse .  | " Picked up a bit , " he said , " but it 's probably only temporary , " " Will he live ? " asked Mattingly . There was an authoritative shake of the head . " Not a chance . " " Could you bring him to consciousness , then ? For a minute , maybe ? " A shade of annoyance crossed the young man 's face , as if to say that when he pronounced a man dying there would be no foolishness about consciousness . He shrugged . " I 'll try , " he said . " Suppose you wait in the hall . The nurse will call you if the adrenalin takes hold . " Harriett was glad to be in the cheerfulness of the corridor , but she moved not an arm 's length from the door . And Mattingly and Wells , sober and thoughtful , stayed with her . " How did it happen , Matt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's about all I know . We were coming out of the W. B. and A. station  --  Flick handcuffed to one of my men and two others and myself near by to take him to Headquarters  --  and as we got out on the pavement in front of the station there was a shot from somewhere and Flick fell down with a bullet in his chest . And there you are . " " But , man , it does n't make sense ! Do n't you know what direction the shot came from ? Did n't you see anyone running ? Was n't there something ? " No , Cliff , " said Mattingly with a heavy sigh . " No , to all your questions . No one saw anything or anybody .  | No one heard anything , even . The only thing we know is that Flick was shot in the chest as he was facing the curb . After we realized what had happened , I stayed with Flick , thinking maybe he 'd say something important , and sent the boys up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up right away and got a couple of radio cars on the job , but it was n't any use . I got Flick to the hospital and called you . You know the rest . " " Has the doctor found the bullet ? " " No . It 's still in him . Too deep to be probed for . He ca n't be touched , yet . " Wells reached instinctively for his pipe ; was ready to light it when he remembered where he was . He returned it to his pocket disappointedly and clasped his hands behind his back . " This is the third one , " he said gloomily . " Bond Grayson and John Blann and now Flick . " He was speaking as though entirely to himself : thinking aloud . " Will there be a fourth ? Not , I suppose , unless we begin to solve this business and the murderer finds it out . When that happens , we 'll have to be very careful . Very , very careful . Our man , whoever he is , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make trouble for him . Quite dangerous . . . . And what makes me laugh , " he said , looking up suddenly at Mattingly , " is how you can keep on deluding yourself about young Grayson . He sits in the Penitentiary waiting for the hangman while a killer like this roams the streets ! " Mattingly reddened and twitched his shoulders un-  | comfortably . " Do n't blame me too much , Cliff , " he said . " The boy got a fair trial , and if it turned out to be a raw deal for him at least we 're trying to straighten it up . . . . You know damned well I only did what I thought was right ! " ' Wells heaved a sigh . " Yes , I suppose so , Matt . Forget it , will you ? This case is getting on my nerves . " " Getting on your nerves ? Ha ! What about me ? How do you think I feel , with men getting shot right under my nose and no traces left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suddenly , became aware of the torture that lay within them . With Clifford Wells it was the torture of a mathematician faced by an equation beyond his rationalization ; with Mattingly it was the ignominy of a perfect job coming down upon his head . And she was filled , then , with an insight into both of them that made her want to speak comfortingly , forgivingly . A slight sound made the three of them whirl about . The operating-room door was open . The nurse beckoned . " He may be able to speak in a moment , " she said . " Be quiet . " 2 . " You 're dying , Flick , " said the professor , firmly and distinctly . " You 're dying . Do you understand me ? " There was a feeble flutter of the eyelids ; a momentary glimpse of the shoe-button eyes that had been so bright . The lips moved .  | " Yes , " he said , barely audibly . " Who shot you ? Do you know ? " Flick shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , " it said . " Who would want to shoot you , Flick ? Someone had to get rid of you to save himself . Who were you blackmailing ? " Harriett wrinkled her brow at this question , as if it had shed light on her suddenly , after darkness . But Flick seemed utterly bewildered . There came into his face a look of incomprehension and great puzzlement which overcame , for a moment , the anguish of his body . " Nobody , " said the lips . " I  --  I do n't know whatyou  --  mean . " The professor attacked quickly from another angle . He knew there would not be much time remaining . " You and Blann were working together on that safe job , were n't you ? " This time the head gave a slow nod . " Yes . " " And you killed Blann to keep him from telling about it ? " " No ! " Flick opened his black eyes wide and gasped out the word convulsively . The surgeon , holding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who did it , then ? " " I  --  I do n't  --  know . " Wells veered again : " You were in the building when Mr. Grayson was killed . Did you see anything ? " A long pause . Then , " Yes . "  | " What did you see ? " Another pause . Flick moved his lips ineffectually several times , and at last words came : " I went up  --  the fire-escape  --  and  --  in the  --  window to  --  see if he was ? still in  --  his office . He  --  was opening  --  his safe . I  --  I watched him from the  --  hallway . When  --  when he got it  --  open he  --  fell down  --  on his desk  --  funny thing , was n't  --  it ? " " Yes , it was , " said Wells tersely . " Then what ? " " Then I  --  beat it upstairs . Man  --  coming up  --  had gun in  --  his hand . I  --  I got back on  --  the  --  fire-escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  again  --  when I ? passed the floor  --  coming down . " " Who was it , Flick ? " " Do n't know  --  his name . Looked like a  --  bum . " Then the professor barked out a series of names , pausing after each to watch for the effect on the dying man 's face : " Marsh ? Spurrier ? Alexander Barton ? " Here the thin face drew into a slight , painful frown . " Jordan Ambers ? Johnson , the elevator operator ? " " Maybe , " gasped Flick , after another long pause , " it was ? that fellow ? always tight ? looked ? like " The sentence was never finished , for the black eyes closed under the descending curtain and the body heaved once and no more . And the doctor looked up and nodded meaningly. 3 . The bullet that killed Henry Flick was in Wells ' hand not long afterward.  | " A rifle bullet , I think , " he said . " What was the line ? " " It entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the surgeon , " and slanted downward . " He demonstrated on his own body . " Downward . " Wells tapped his chin for a moment and then swung about to Mattingly exultantly . " There 's the answer ! Downward ! Have your men take a look at the roofs of the buildings in front of the station ! " The red-haired lieutenant swore blasphemously at himself for a consummate dunce and fairly ran to the telephone . Wells looked at Harriett . " Did you catch everything Flick said , Harry ? " " I think it 's all here . " She flourished the notebook . " Does it mean anything to you ? Did you draw any conclusions ? " " Of course , Cliff . Everything points to Alexander Barton . He always looks like a bum , just as poor Mr. Flick said . He " Has n't it occurred to you that a man like Barton , Harry , would he the easiest type in the world to  --  to imitate ? He looks like a bum . He dresses carelessly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seeing him without paying much attention to him . Do you see what I mean ? " " Oh , " murmured Harriett , " then you think ? " " I do n't know for sure , yet , but I expect to find out very soon . Let 's get busy . " Wells hurried off in Mattingly 's footsteps , with Harriett hopping to keep pace  | with him . " You see the difference , " he asked , " between a murder two months old and one an hour old ? Where one is all dried up and hard to get hold of , the other gives you something to bite on . It gives you a chance to get a step ahead of the killer if you move fast . " " Which , " asked Harriett , " is what you 're going to do ? " " Which is what I 'm going to do  --  maybe , " replied the professor . Mattingly 's brisk orders had been given when they reached him . He was hanging up the receiver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " or did you send them all out ? " " Got plenty left . What 's to do ? " " Round up the whole shebang and put ' em in room 719 , Grayson Building . " " Who ? Who d' you want ? " " You heard the names I reeled off to Flick , did n't you ? Round ' em up and put a guard over them  --  or watch ' em yourself . I 'll he there " ? the professor pulled out his watch ? " within three-quarters of an hour . And have Sam and the doctor there , too . " " But  --  what about warrants ? " " Warrants ! Good God ! " Wells dismissed the objection with a wave . " Do n't bother me with details . Get ' em . . . . Here 's my key to the office . Come on , Harry . " He strode off quickly , ungallantly , but Harriett , running to catch up , did not mind . Things were moving too quickly  --  and interestingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cab , when they had reached the street , and helped her in . " Maryland Hall , Johns Hopkins University , " he snapped . " And do n't let any cobwebs grow on your accelerator . " Then he leaned back and reached thankfully for his pipe . " At last , " he said , " we 're on the offensive . With just a little break or two we might get somewhere . " He rested comfortably on the small of his back and puffed great aromatic clouds . " You feel rather sure , do n't you , " Harriett wanted to know , " that only one man is responsible for all three of these murders ? " The professor cocked an eye at her . " I have n't said that . Never . " " But you 've hinted at it . " " Guessed ' is a better word . I 've done a lot of guessing on darned few facts . . . . Tell me , Harry , if you will , a little more about Oliver Grayson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Would you like to see him ? " There was a thoughtful pause . " Not particularly , " said Wells , then . " But I 'd like to have you tell me about him . Have you seen him lately ? " This time it was Harriett 's turn to hesitate . Then she said , apologetically , " No . Not since I finished typing his manuscript . " " Do you mind if I ask why you have n't seen him ? " " Well , I " Harriett stopped quickly , as if what she had intended to say should not be said . She finished  | lamely : " We 've been so busy since you came in on the case that I really have n't had time to visit him . " " You expect me to believe that ? " " Yes . Do n't you ? " " My dear girl , of course I do n't . I 'm not blind , you know . You do n't love him any more than you would love a sheep fighting wolves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyal to him , but  --  you do n't love him . " Harriett 's voice took on a decided chill . " I did n't know your talents included reading young women 's hearts , " she said , " but since I 've found it out , you may like to know that you 're wrong . " " You do love him , then ? " " Of course I do . " " You 're sure it 's not simply pity for the underdog ? Sympathy because he seems so helpless , so defenseless ? " " Why must you keep on with this ? What are you trying to say to me ? " Wells proceeded calmly to relight his pipe . He stared moodily at the passing view , now gloomy with the shade of a cloudy afternoon sky . He slouched down farther on the seat when his pipe was burning well once more , and heaved a great sigh . " In some things , Harry , " he said slowly , " I 'm as clumsy as a fifteen-year-old boy . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sophomores pretty well , I think , and in a murder-hunt like this I can generally make a fair showing . But when it comes to tactfulness  | and diplomacy , and the art of implication and innuendo , I 'm licked before I start . " " Listen , Cliff . " Harriett turned about squarely to face him . " I think I know what you 're trying to do . You want to tell me something about Oliver . You 've discovered something . What is it ? " He returned look for look . " Harry , " he said , " I know nothing , definitely , about the boy that I 've concealed from you . All I 've been trying to lead up to is to ask you , if we should be successful in this chase for our murderer and get Oliver set free , not to  --  well , not to do anything unless you 're sure . " " You mean  --  do n't marry him ! " " I refuse to say another word , my dear young woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And I say , " said Harriett , " that you 're being unfair to him  --  and to me  --  unless you tell me what you 're hiding from me . It might not be definite , as you put it , but what is it ? " " Not another word , " Wells replied firmly , but he suddenly warmed her heart with a pleading , tremulous smile . " Will you promise , Harry ? " " I promise , " she said .  | CHAPTER IX 1 . DEEP into the lower , labyrinthine depths of Maryland Hall Clifford Wells led Harriett , winding about perplexingly , taking short cuts unerringly through darkened , mysterious-looking laboratories , and stopping at last before a narrow , inconspicuous door , beneath which gleamed a line of brightness from within . Wells grunted with pleasure . " Knew he 'd be here , " he said . " Who ? " asked Harriett . " A young chap you 'll like very much . Paul Maccabbee . Graduate student , and a bright lad if there ever was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's Wells , Paul . All right to come in ? " There was the scrape of a chair . The door opened . A stout and disheveled young man , hardly of voting age , blinked out into the dimness from beneath a large green eyeshade and nodded a welcome . " This , " said Wells , " is Mr. Maccabbee . Miss Fleming , Paul . " There were mutual nods . " We 've got a job for you , Paul , if you can get away for a while . " " Sure , " said Maccabbee , putting down the slide-rule he held in one hand and reaching for his coat . " What sort of a job ? "  | " You 've been looking for a chance to give your psycho-galvanometer a good test , have n't you ? " " You bet I have . " Maccabbee became eager . " Have you got one for me , at last ? " Wells nodded grimly . " At last , I have . And I think it 's going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shall I get it now ? It 's all ready . I was demonstrating it this afternoon . " " Good . There 's a taxi waiting for us . " " Give me two minutes to get it together . How many subjects will there be ? " " Seven . Maybe eight . Make it eight . " " Yes , sir 1 " The youth ran enthusiastically from the tiny room . Harriett quite naturally demanded to be told what in the world a psycho-gal  --  whatever the name was ? could be . " Psycho-galvanometer . Popularly known as a liedetector . " " Oh , " said Harriett , greatly enlightened . " A liedetector . " Maccabbee came back bearing a jumbled mass of apparatus . Chief piece of the mass was a black wooden case which gave signs of having been , in a previous existence , a soap-box . Embedded in its top and sides were a number of small switches , knobs , dials and lights , and a rectangular opening in the top surface gave Harriett a view of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tracer arms , inked from tiny reservoirs , in a straight line across the width of the paper .  | After arranging the rest of the litter , consisting principally of a storage battery and a number of long , flexible wires looped in small rolls and with curious flat contacts dangling from their ends , Maccabbee removed his green eyeshade , gave his tousled black hair a smoothing and announced he was ready . " I 'll carry the battery , Paul , " said Wells . Maccabbee picked up the box and its attendant wires gently and made his way out . And Harriett followed uncertainly , hoping that neither of the two would stumble . Wells looked back at her . " We shall soon see , " he said , " what we shall see . " " But , " said she , " will it work ? Can you depend on it ? " The storage battery was heavy , and Wells puffed a little in replying . " Paul says it will . Says it ca n't fail . . . . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've seen it do remarkable things in the lab , where it did n't count , of course . . . . And if it does work , well  --  we 'll know what to do , then . " Harriett climbed into the taxicab under Maccabbee 's watchful eye , and arranged her feet to his satisfaction so that the box would not be harmed . Wells got in beside her . Maccabbee took the seat in front but turned around and leaned back to maintain a constant vigil on his apparatus . The driver seemed to think it contained dynamite , for he drove as though any slight vibration might set it off , and the youth nodded approvingly at the man . " But , " asked Harriett thoughtfully , " why has n't  | this been used before ? Why wait all this time ? Mr. Flick 's life might have been saved . " " No , " said Wells . " I 'm afraid you give a thing like this too much credit , in spite of what Paul might claim for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know them , prove nothing . It is possible that they might indicate , by fluctuations of blood pressure , that the person under questioning is lying , but it is also possible that he may simply be nervous or overwrought . " Now , this device of Paul 's is based on what I believe to be a good idea . Instead of blood pressure as the means of indication , he uses the variation of a tiny electric current passed through the subject 's body from one hand to the other . You 've often noticed , I suppose , that when you get excited or emotional , the palms of your hands perspire . This apparatus uses that perspiration as the means of detecting the subject 's emotion , since the resistance of the electrical circuit , through contacts on the subject 's two palms , will vary according to the amount of moisture that appears . Then the galvanometer dial , following every change in the resistance of the circuit , registers on the moving paper chart and makes a continuous , definite record of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Paul ? " " Yes , sir , " said Maccabbee , " only there 's more to it , of course . " Then he took up the explanation himself : " You see , Miss Fleming , the variations of the * The principle here described is based upon the psycho-galvanometer frequently  --  and successfully  --  demonstrated by Father W. G. Summers of Fordham University  --  THE AUTHOR .  | galvanometer needle on one man would n't mean very much . You could n't tell whether a sudden jump came from a lie or a guilty conscience , or whether it came from getting warm naturally and perspiring or from some other normal reason . But when you test a number of persons all at once , some of whom you know are not under accusation and who therefore would n't be affected by the questions being asked , then all those natural reasons for variations in the chart cancel out , and you 've got a basis for comparing the jumps in your suspect 's chart against the jumps in the charts of several innocent people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of guilt , if that jump did n't occur at the same time on the other charts . See ? " " Not altogether , " admitted Harriett . " You tell her , Mr. Wells . " Wells did his best : " We are going to make a test , Harry , on eight people  --  seven men and one woman ? and we will " Who 's the woman ? " " You . " " Why me ? " " Let me tell you . . . . Of these eight , you and six of the men , I hope , are innocent . The seventh man is the one we want . He , if we can single him out , is the man who killed Henry Flick . Whether he is also responsible for the other two deaths remains to be seen . . . . Now , to get back to Paul 's explanation , suppose we put it another way : The emotions of anyone taking  | a test like this would show wide fluctuations , whether from guilt or from other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have one , would show jerks and jumps on the chart and still be as innocent and truthful as can be . But if your grandmother 's chart showed consistently bigger variations than the charts of half-a-dozen other people taken at the same time , then I 'd begin to suspect her of having killed the canary or poisoning the pup . " Harriett nodded . " Then the charts on each person are only relative , with the unsteadiest one showing the guilty man ? " " That 's it . " Wells leaned back , his lesson over . " And I hope it works . . . . You sec. , to get the best possible comparison on the charts , I 've included in this test every person who has been concerned with the case in any way , knowing that some of them ca n't possibly be guilty . " " Then that , " said Harriett , " is why Sam Peterson and the doctor were called in ? " Wells patted her hand reassuringly . " That 's why , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this machine could n't have been used before this . " " Simply , my dear , because it would n't have worked . The first two murders were months old , and after that length of time almost anyone could lie up hill and down and keep a straight face  --  or rather , a straight chart . But now , within two hours of this last murder ? a scant hundred minutes  --  our man may appear calm  | outwardly but his brain and his nerves will be churning and quivering from reaction , and from acute fear of what we are doing to him . And , if the detector works , we 'll get him ! " Paul Maccabbee nodded sagely , as if to say : " The detector will work . " " And you 're certain your man is in the seven ? " asked Harriett . " For the love of Heaven , Harry , do n't ask me that ! Do n't even think it ! He 's got to be ! " " Yes , " agreed Harriett , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mattingly , chewing furiously on his gum and pacing the corridor , sighed with relief as the three stepped from the elevator . " Got ' em all there , Cliff , " he said , " but what a job , what a job ! They 're every one ready to chew nails  --  except old Peterson . He just sits there and does his regular work as if nothing had ever happened . " " Was the poor man in bed ? " asked Harriett , sympathetically . " No . He was in pajamas and a bathrobe , up in his room . But he did n't object to coming down . Said he was n't feeling so bad , but I felt right sorry for him . " Wells said : " What about the roofs , Matt ? " " Oh , them . " Mattingly spoke as if the search had been simple . " Found the rifle and empty cartridge-case on top o ' the B. and O. Annex . But nobody remembered seeing anyone go up or come down . It was easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get up there unnoticed . " " Very neat , " said Wells . " Very . . . . All right , let 's go in . " They were , as Mattingly had said , all there . Seven men : one who looked up calmly from his desk and regarded the professor with a puzzled and benignant frown , and six who stared resentfully . And all six , it seemed , spoke at once . Wells hitched up his belt and looked grim . " Please , gentlemen , quiet ! " The disturbance subsided as quickly as it had come . There was quiet . " Now , " said Wells in his normal tone , " suppose we get down to business . . . . There 's no need to ask me what this is all about or why you 've been dragged here by Lieutenant Mattingly 's Cossacks . We 'll skip all that . . . . Every one of you knows precisely what we 're after , or if you do n't you 're duller than I think . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and think about your sins for a little while . " The professor then glanced slowly about the group , eying each in turn for a moment . And with a wave he sent Maccabbee into the inner office , burdened with all his equipment , and closed the door behind the youth , shutting him off from view . He nodded meaningly to one of the plain-clothes men , who slipped to the corridor door and stood with his back against it , his jaw saying firmly that no one would pass while he was there . That done , the professor stood in the center of the room and surveyed his audience once more . In a chair  | near the door Todd Spurrier sat straight and tapped one foot nervously , while his eyes stared widely from Wells to Mattingly and back again . Jordan Ambers , seated ever so negligently on the corner of Harriett 's desk , was obviously the big business man wasting time . Every few minutes he pulled out his watch , studied it and slipped it back into his pocket , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood leaning against the filing-cabinet , watching the proceedings with interest . Johnson , the elevator operator , was presumably so accustomed to standing in the presence of others that he did it now , and the perspiration of abject dread poured down his weak and trembling chin and into his collar . He probably had been aroused from his afternoon sleep : his whole appearance was of a man not fully awakened from a bad dream . On Harriett 's chair sat Alexander Barton . He was sober , cold sober . He ran his tongue over dry lips and made a literal picture of a man wishing for a drink . His eyes roamed flutteringly about the room , resting nowhere , and his thick hands opened and shut spasmodically . The seventh man of the group might have gone unnoticed had he not been so still . He huddled back into a corner , grasped the arms of his chair with tense , bony fingers and was motionless . His eyes were on Wells immovably , and his breath  --  if he really were breathing ? came and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stir . Mr. Richard Lee Marsh seemed most apprehen-  | sive . Harriett , watching him , was amazed at this change from the pleasant , dignified man she knew . In this complete silence that was like the lull before a storm , Harriett sank into a chair Mattingly found for her and waited for Wells to begin . It soon came . The professor spoke quietly and almost casually , as if the class he addressed were being reviewed on a lesson already familiar : " At three o'clock this afternoon , gentlemen , there was a man killed . Someone here , in this room , killed him . That much we know , positively . And " Please , Mr. ' Wells , " interrupted Sam Peterson , apologetically , " who was it ? Was it anyone I know ? " " You knew him , all right , " said Wells . " It was Henry Flick , Sam . " " But I never knew him ! " Jordan Ambers stood and let his voice boom . " I protest against this monkeybusiness ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sit down , Mr. Ambers ! " Mr. Ambers sat down . " I 've not asked anyone whether he knew Flick or not , " he went on , " and I do n't intend to for the present . . . but nevertheless I am going to find out who killed him . Do you understand that , gentlemen ? I 'm going to find out ! " Harriett detected the force of certainty in his words . He meant what he said . He would find the man . 3 . Then Wells turned and opened the door to the inner office slightly . " Are you ready , Paul ? "  | " All ready , Mr. Wells , " came the voice from within . " Here are the leads . " The professor took the proffered neat coils of wire on which dangled broad terminals and heavy elastic bands . One end of each coil remained in the inner room . Jordan Ambers , nearest to Wells , was first . A wire was fastened firmly to each of his hands by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose in a fury . " See here , Mr. Wells ! I protest against " That 's what you said before , my dear fellow . I advise you to be still . . . . Number one , Mr. Ambers ! " " Number one  --  Ambers , " repeated an excited voice from within . A pause . . . . " Number two , Dr. Appleby . " " Number two  --  Appleby . " The doctor was amused . He displayed his strapped hands to Harriett and smiled . " Number three , Mr. Spurrier . " " Number three , " came the repetition , " Mr. Spurrier . " The list was quickly completed . There were no further protests . Only William Johnson would have drawn back from the outthrust wires but Wells quieted him with a curt word . Barton seemed less interested in what was being done to him than in looking about thirstily . Marsh , in his corner , barely moved , and stared back dumbly , and Sam Peterson and Harriett received the terminals on their hands with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Wells , straightening up , " we 're ready . Suppose you relax for a moment and listen to what I have to say . " Spurrier interrupted : " Will we get a shock from these wires , Mr. Wells ? " " That remains to be seen , Mr. Spurrier . I think someone might be a little shocked , but it wo n't be from electricity . " " It 's a lie-detector , is n't it ? " asked Sam Peterson pleasantly , as though he were more curious than apprehensive . " It is . " Ambers bellowed , then . " Oh , a lie-detector ! Well , I wo n't submit to it ! I demand my constitutional rights ! I ? " " You 'll sit down and behave yourself , . Mr. Ambers ! " Wells , after this one sharp bark , paid no further attention to him , but turned about and continued the thread of his discourse : " Henry Flick was killed , gentlemen , because he knew too much . He knew something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been ? We can be sure that it was n't a trifle . No one  --  not even the most brutal of us  --  kills without a good reason , or at least a reason that seems good at the time . Therefore we know that he was killed for a reason that must have been as vile and horrible as the means taken to keep him quiet . Now , what can be as horrible as murder  --  except murder ? Would an embezzler of , say , fifty thousand dollars resort to murder to save himself from a short  | jail sentence ? Of course he would n't , if he was in his right mind , because the game would n't be worth the candle . . . . No , Henry Flick 's murderer was already a murderer . That 's why Flick had to die . " Wells paused and let his eyes meet those of eight people , in slow rotation about the room , while he absently dropped a bright coin from one palm to the other . " That murderer is here with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and I 'm telling him now that his game is up . He has played and won this far , but it gives me a good deal of pleasure to tell him that his winning card  --  the shot that killed Henry Flick  --  has been trumped by Flick himself ! . . . For although he has been killed , he did n't die at once . He lived long enough to gasp out to us  --  with his last breath  --  all we need to know . . . . " Henry Flick was on this floor the night Bond Grayson was shot . He saw the murderer approach this room about ten-thirty that night . IIe saw the pistol in the murderer 's hand . He saw the murderer leave after his ghastly deed was done . And he described the murderer to me ! . . . Shall I point him out , gentlemen ? " Every tongue in the room was mute . Wells stood with his legs spread apart , stable , calm , confident , with his coin slapping softly from palm to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strewn wires , entered the private office and closed the door . Harriett heard him speak in quick , sharp whispers to Maccabbee . A whir of small gears and a rustle of paper followed . There was a long silence from within .  | She could see the shadow of the professor 's broad , flat back bending over in concentration . She saw him look up and saw his head shake jerkily . " No , " that shake said , " it ca n't be ! " But Maccabbee nodded " Yes , it is ! " And then Wells straightened up slowly and came back to the outer office . He walked as though he were very tired , and Harriett saw lines upon his face that had not been there before . He walked to the center of the room and turned first to her as if to beg her forgiveness . Then his face hardened as he swung around . " Sam , " he said , " why did you do it ? " 4-Harriett was on her feet , crying , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room spun crazily about and made her dizzy . " No , Cliff , you 're wrong ! " Wells caught her , kept her from falling . " Why , Sam ? " he repeated . " Why ? " Sam Peterson , after the first question , had blinked in surprise and contracted his eyebrows in a seeming bewilderment of incomprehension . He leaned forward in his swivel-chair , looked first at Wells and then about the room as if doubtful of what he had heard . His mouth gaped open and worked spasmodically before words would come . Then he said , unexpectedly calmly and clearly : " You 've been misled somewhere , Mr. Wells , I assure you . Did you really mean me ? "  | " Of course he did n't , Sam ! " Harriett was controlling , somehow , the hysteria that beset her . " He has been misled ! He 's forgetting his good judgment and putting far too much faith in an uncertain contrivance ! " Maccabbee defended his machine vehemently : " The contrivance has been tested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't yet been wrong . " " But , " said Harriett quickly , " has it been tested with a man 's life in the balance ? Has it been tested against the self-control and desperation that the real murderer we 're looking for must have ? " " Well , no , " admitted Maccabbee , " I suppose not . " " Then go back to your machine and see what 's the matter with it . It 's hideously wrong this time . " Mattingly stepped up to make a suggestion : " Would n't do any harm , would it , to kind of look into Peterson 's activities this afternoon ? " The old man smiled . " That wo n't be hard . I had n't been out of my home for two days until your men came and got me an hour ago . I 've had a rather bad attack of sciatica . " " So you say . " " So I say . And so will my wife and two daughters . " He stood up and stripped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need more proof , ask Miss Fleming herself where I was this afternoon . Mr. Wells said the murder took place at three o'clock . It happens that Miss Fleming called me on the ' phone at my home at about fifteen minutes before that , to ask me how I  | was feeling . Now I do n't know where the murder took place , but I 'll be glad to know how I got up and dressed and there , wherever it was , in fifteen minutes . . . . I 'm really very sorry , " he said , turning to the professor , " but you 'll have to look further for your man . " Mattingly sighed and looked at Wells , who frowned but nevertheless did not seem altogether displeased . " I 'm glad for your sake , Sam , " he said . " I had a great deal of faith in this apparatus . I 've seen it give uncannily accurate results in tests on groups of students at Hopkins . But , " he added , ruefully , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fleming has said , that when the machine is put up against a man 's whole desperate will  --  the will to save his neck  --  the damned thing does n't work . " He sat down abruptly on a chair and ran his fingers through his hair despondently . " Might as well let ' em go , Matt . I 'm through for the present . Maybe for good . " The policeman at the door moved away sadly and stood to one side . And no sooner had he done so than Wells sprang up and waved him back to his place . Then he stood still , triumphantly , and spoke with elation : " Now , gentlemen , our test is really over . You can take your bracelets off . . . . Paul , how does the chart look ? " " Fine ! Bringing it right out ! " " Then , " said Harriett uncertainly , " you really did n't find anything against Sam , after all ? "  | " Not a thing , Harry . That was part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tremendous surge of relief and exultation by hearing someone else accused instead of himself , as he had expected , and to rejoice with jubilation at what he thought was a failure of the lie-detector . The emotion of reaction is greater , and far more uncontrollable , than direct emotion . That happens to be the only point of this whole test . Everything else was just a build-up to that point . . . . Give me that chart , Paul , and go pat yourself on the back for a good performance . . . . H 'm . . . .

Heir to Grayson Millions Proven Innocent Despite Conviction ! Jordan Ambers , Prominent Ship-Line President , Signs Full Confession of Murder and is Held Without Bail . Oliver Grayson Receives Immediate Pardon . LATE FLASH  --  In a sensational announce ? ment late this afternoon , Police Commis. sioner Charles D. Gaither stated that a complete confession of the shooting of Bond Grayson , for which Oliver Grayson , his nephew and heir , had been convicted and sentenced to hang , has been obtained from Jordan Ambers , president of a large shipping concern with offices in the Grayson Building . The Commissioner further stated that Governor Nice , immediately upon being informed of this development in a case that had evoked nation-wide interest , has granted an unconditional executive pardon to Oliver Grayson , effective at once . He will  | be released from the death house at the Maryland Penitentiary as soon as the formal order , which has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ambers ' confession , said the Commissioner , resulted from the unremitting efforts of Lieutenant Barney Mattingly of the Homicide Squad , who , despite the conviction and sentencing of Oliver Grayson for the murder of his uncle , had continued his investigations into certain unexplained circumstances surrounding the shooting . EDITOR 'S NOTE : It has been pointed out that Lieutenant Mattingly 's doubts as to Oliver Grayson 's guilt were considerably strengthened by the publication , in this paper , of Grayson 's own version of the affair entitled " Manuscript From Cell 19 . " It was written while Mr. Grayson awaited hanging in the death house of the Penitentiary . ) From the detailed statement dictated and signed by Ambers , it appears that Bond Grayson , wealthy business man and philanthropist , was shot by Ambers while asleep at his desk and unable to make an outcry or defend himself . When pressed for the reason behind the killing , Ambers would give no response other than to say , " I killed him and I 'll take the consequences . " Ambers was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder . He admits having avoided recognition by impersonating in dress and manner the appearance of Alexander Barton , another tenant in the same building , who , Ambers knew , would be there that evening . Ambers further guarded against detection , he stated , by appearing both before and after the murder at a conference of ship-owners at a near-by hotel , slipping out for less than a half-hour to don his disguise and commit the murder . A quick change of clothing in his automobile and a return to the meeting , where his absence had not been noticed , followed the attack on Mr. Grayson . Ambers said he had been careful to wipe his revolver clean of all fingerprints and to  | hold it with a handkerchief , dropping it purposely on the floor of Mr. Grayson 's office after the shot was fired , knowing that the pistol , which he had purchased in New York some time previously , could not be traced . Despite these careful preparations , however , Lieutenant Mattingly'and his assistants , working quietly and without general knowledge , gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakdown and confession in a triumph of deductive skill and persistence . 2 . " Good God ! " exploded Wells in derision . " Triumph of deductive skill and persistence ! ' Triumph , my eye ! Triumph of great gobs of luck , poured on thick ! " He flung the newspaper to the floor of the warden 's office and gave it a petulant kick . " There , now , " soothed Harriett , smiling at him happily . " Do n't let it annoy you . Let them call it that if they wish . " " But my dear sweet child , " he replied , wearily , " do n't you realize that nothing whatever under the sun but Ambers ' own weakness made him confess to the shooting of Bond Grayson ? If he had been able to keep his mouth shut  --  not blurt out the way he did  --  we 'd be not one iota farther ahead of where we were yesterday . Do n't you see that it was n't skill or persistence at all , but only ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let 's hear no more about it . Do n't you agree , gentlemen ? " The gentlemen agreed  --  even Mattingly , who  | should n't have . Dr. Appleby nodded and paced about impatiently , as if wishing that Oliver Grayson would be released and the whole affair done with immediately . And Sam Peterson , still wincing at times from faint sciatic stabs of pain , grunted amiably from the depths of a soft leather armchair . Warden Brady maintained his silence ; merely looked with the utmost disapproval at the crumpled newspaper on his office floor . " Seems to me , " said Sam Peterson , " there 's no question about it . Jordan Ambers would be safe right now  --  might never have been caught  --  if he had n't been hoodwinked into giving himself away . That , ladies and gentlemen , took skill ! " " Luck , I say , " objected Wells . " The whole damned test was wrong . We were after the man who killed Henry Flick , and we did n't get him . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not kill Flick . I " How do you know that ? " asked Mattingly . " I know it because I saw Ambers , with my own two fairly good eyes , on the elevator in the Grayson Building at a little before three o'clock . While Miss Fleming was calling Sam on the telephone , I went down to get some tobacco . And Ambers got on the same elevator and stopped and talked to someone on the first floor for a while . . . . No , he did n't kill Flick . Could n't have , because your telephone call to me , Matt , came very soon after I got back upstairs . " Wells puffed savagely at his pipe and scowled . " So there we are . We shoot for a rabbit and get a rhinoceros . We want  | Flick 's killer and we get Bond Grayson 's . And you say it was n't luck ! " " Too bad , then , " chuckled Sam Peterson , despite his pain , " if the test had been a success ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the lieutenant here , with all due respect , mind you , gets all the credit in the newspaper story . Why not a little for you , Mr. Wells ? " Mattingly was frank : " Just what I said . Nobody knows better than I do that he did the whole job . . . . But I 'm satisfied to have him do the work and give me the credit . " Harriett was not deceived . " Was there , or was there not , " she demanded , " a reason for not having your name mentioned , my dear professor ? " Wells stirred and glanced at her . " There was , " he said , shortly . " And what was fhe reason , if I may ask ? Do n't you like to see your name in print ? " " I 'll tell you why it was , " he replied , turning to face her . " It 's a good deal less unselfish than it seems . I simply do n't want to be made the goat when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Mattingly was one big question mark . " What d' you mean , goat ? " " Goat . A four-letter word meaning leading with your chin . " " Do n't be so riddleish , Cliff , " begged Mattingly . " What 's on your mind ? What truth is going to come out ? " For reply Wells pulled out his watch , allowing Mat-  | tingly and the others to stew in their perplexity . " You said the release would be here at seven-thirty , Warden . It 's quarter to eight now . Could n't you let young Grayson out now and wait for the release to come later ? " The warden shook his head firmly . " Not until the order comes , " he said . " Might all be a mistake , and where would I he then ? " And at that moment a much-excited young State policeman , thrilled with the importance of his mission , burst into the office and held out a crested envelope , sealed heavily with impressive red wax , to the warden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron doors of Maryland Penitentiary , to speak metaphorically , were flung wide with a wondrous clang to- free a righteous human being from undeserved bondage and nearmartyrdom ; a being who , once beyond the confining walls , sank to his knees in ecstasy at his delivery . Actually , however , the warden 's door opened a bit creakily to let a somewhat bewildered and quite undramatic Oliver Grayson out . He appeared at a loss as to his direction , and started forth from the door uncertainly . And his first words , said to no one in particular , were : " I need a drink . " But some time was to pass before he got one . There were reporters to be satisfied ; photographers ; special writers on assignment to get a " first-page story with a punch " ; curiosity-seekers who pressed close and tore  | buttons from his wrinkled summer suit ( which was the one he had worn through the trial ) and pleaded for autographs and clambered on the running-boards of the car ( which Wells had had foresight enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off like gnats . Harriett and Wells got into the car with him . The others went on ahead . And not until they were in motion did Wells have a decent opportunity to see what manner of man this was he had saved  --  at least ostensibly  --  from the gallows . He saw a pale and drawn young man whose eyes were still wide with the inability to realize fully that he was free . He was not tall , not short ; not thin , not stout ; and he was  --  so the professor thought  --  unnecessarily good-looking . Why must he be both good-looking and rich ? Oliver Grayson was oddly quiet . For a man who had just escaped the hangman 's noose he seemed singularly unhappy . " Where are we going ? " he asked . " To your home in Roland Park , Oliver , " replied Harriett . " Is n't that where you want to go ? " " Yes . . . yes , I suppose so , " he said , rubbing his chin . " Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's been there all this time , " said Harriett . " Said he had no place else to go . " Oliver Grayson nodded and was seemingly lost in abstraction . Harriett 's brow wrinkled in a frown . She looked over to Wells . He had his lips pursed thoughtfully .  | " What 's the matter , Oliver ? " asked Harriett . " You do n't seem very glad to be  --  to be  --  out . " Grayson smiled a sickly , hesitant smile . " Oh , but I am , " he said . " Very glad . I  --  you do n't know how glad ! I guess I just ca n't believe what 's happened . . . . I want to thank you , Harriett , for what you 've done for me . " " Do n't thank me . Thank Mr. Wells . " " Oh , of course . . . of course . I do thank you , Mr. Wells . " " Do n't mention it . " " But I will mention it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something  --  even mine . . . . Which reminds me , Mr. Wells , that when the estate is settled and straightened out there will be a check coming to you . " " Check ? To me ? What for ? " Harriett broke in delightedly : " The reward . Ten thousand dollars . Do n't you remember ? " Wells nodded emphatically . " I recall quite clearly , " he said , " that there was ten thousand dollars posted for information leading to the arrest of the man who killed your uncle . . . . Yes , I remember . " " Then why did you pretend you knew nothing of it ? " protested Harriett . " Were you just being polite ? " " Oh , no , " said Wells . " Where that much money is involved I absolutely refuse to be polite . I 'm only a poor college instructor , you know , and I could use it very well . " Then he added , with a not too subtle glance at Harriett : " You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Honeymoon ? " she inquired , much too enthusiastically . " How simply wonderful ! Who 's the lucky girl ? What 's she like ? " " About your height , " he answered , blowing smoke at the roof of the car . " She 's sort of in my line  --  detective work . She thinks she 's pretty good , but she makes mistakes . Oh , yes , many , many mistakes . " " But she keeps her promises , does n't she ? " Harriett asked innocently . " That remains to be seen , " said Wells . " Remains . . . to be seen . " Oliver Grayson , seated between them , seemed not to listen . " Now about that money , " he said , " I do n't see  --  " " Yes , about the money , " cut in Clifford Wells briskly . " It 's not for me or anyone else  --  yet . " " Why not ? What do you'mean ? " " I mean this . " Wells leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pipe on his other hand : " I mean that I took this case to find the murderer of Bond Grayson , and I 'll take no money , whether you call it a reward or a fee or anything else , until I find him ! " " But " said Harriett . " But , " said Oliver Grayson , " is n't Jordan Ambers ? " Wells leaned back and shook his head slowly , confidently . " Of course not , " he said . " He thinks he is , but he is n't ! "  | CHAPTER XI 1 . DR . APPLEBY , Lieutenant Mattingly and Sam Peterson had not been delayed by the autograph-seekers and had therefore made much better time in reaching Oliver Grayson 's home . They greeted him as he entered the great high-ceilinged room ; tried to make him feel at ease . Mattingly pushed the big armchair , built for Bond Grayson 's hugeness , forward invitingly , and saw him flush and frown . And then they understood . Oliver Grayson took another , smaller chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will someone call George ? Where 's George ? " George did not need to be called . He was at the rear of the room , inconspicuous behind the angle of the fireplace . He had been waiting there with his hat in his hand and a shabby , old-fashioned grip , packed and ready , at his feet . He came forth timidly at the mention of his name and stood , a pathetic , woebegone figure , blinking slowly and watching the master of the house anxiously . " I  --  I did n't mean to stay , sir , " he said . " I 'll be going now . Good-bye , sir . " " Going ? " asked Oliver Grayson , puzzled . " Going where ? "  | " I  --  do n't know , sir . " The tone was thoroughly hopeless . " You do n't know ? Then why ? " I did n't think you 'd want me any longer , sir , after ? after what 's happened . So I thought I 'd better go . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave without that . " Oliver Grayson rose and walked to him ; took his hat from his hands . " Nonsense , George , " he said . " You 're still afraid of me , are n't you ? Have n't we had enough of all that ? What 's been done is all over now , and we 're starting fresh again . . . . Tell me , George , did my uncle ever , well , did he ever indulge in a drink ? Have you any good rye here ? " George , smiling all at once , nodded eagerly , and his bald head glistened at the motion . " Oh , yes , sir . Plenty . " " Fine . How many people-do you see in this room , George ? " The servant turned to count . " Six , sir . " " All right . Now run back to the kitchen and mix up eight of the best highballs you can make . That 's one each for everybody and two for me . I think I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir ? " " That 's for you , George . And no more of this going-away business . Understand ? " George understood . " Yes , sir ! " he said , and disappeared . And there was soon a happy rattling of glassware and ice from the kitchen .  | 2 . " And now , " said Oliver Grayson , when the highballs had been properly hoisted and downed , " I feel better . I feel more like a human being than I have for a long while . . . . Suppose we get down to business . " " Business ? " asked Dr. Appleby . " What business ? " " I 'm sure I do n't know , " said Grayson . " It 's up to Mr. Wells to explain . You see , he got us all together this way . He 's been making some rather mysterious re-marks " He has that , " agreed Mattingly. " ? and he has to explain them . What about it , Mr. Wells ? " The professor set down his glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment before speaking , and paced the breadth of the room in leisurely fashion . Then he stood still , facing the others . Harriett watched him quizzically , interested now not so much in Clifford Wells , the scientist , or in Clifford Wells , the schoolteacher , as in Clifford Wells , the man . Oliver Grayson was now free , she thought , and she found herself realizing that the fact of his freedom had lifted from her mind the weight of feeling she had had for him . Had it been pity , and loyalty , and sympathy for the underdog ? Just as Cliff had said ? She was almost willing , now , to admit it . Wells said : " Mr. Grayson is right . I got you together here purposely , in order to talk over certain things . And he 's right , too , about my making mysterious  | remarks . I 'll try to explain them , to the best of my ability . I do n't believe they 'll be quite as mysterious when I get through . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the simple fact that our search for the murderer  --  Bond Grayson 's murderer  --  is still unfinished . Jordan Ambers did not kill him . " " I refuse to believe that , Cliff ! Ambers admits it . He not only admits shooting Mr. Grayson but proves , to my satisfaction at least , that he did it ! " The professor smiled sweetly at the red-haired , gumchewing lieutenant and spoke placidly : " Let me go back a little and refresh your mind on a few things , Matt . I feel free to speak here to the rest of you because I know you are all as interested in finding the man we 're after as I am . I " Is that why Marsh and Spurrier and Johnson and Barton were not included here ? " asked Dr. Appleby . " You did n't want to discuss it before them ? " Wells gave him a keen look , as if to say the nail had been pounded true . But he said : " Let 's not mention names unnecessarily , Doctor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you 'll admit , Matt , that Jordan Ambers did n't kill Flick this afternoon . " " In the face of your own alibi for him , " said Mattingly , " I 'm forced to admit it . He could n't be on top of the B. and O. Annex and in the Grayson Building elevator at the same time . " " All right . That 's the first point . Now , we ca n't be certain that Ambers had nothing to do with Blann 's death , but the presumption is that he didn't. "  | " Why ? " " Mainly because Ambers says he did n't . We questioned him closely this afternoon , Matt , you and I , and he ended up with the exact story he had started with ? that he had killed Bond Grayson and no one else . He claims he did n't even know Blann , except to nod to him at the building . . . . Now , as long as Ambers has confessed to shooting Bond Grayson , why should he lie about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He expects to get hung for one murder , and he ca n't be hung twice , you know . Therefore I 'm inclined to believe him when he says he knows nothing whatever of Blann 's death . . . . Well ? " He eyed Mattingly inquiringly . The lieutenant nodded in affirmation . " O. K. so far , " he said . " Go ahead . " " That 's the second point . The third is that both Flick and Blann were killed because of what they knew ? or what they suspected  --  about the Grayson murder . Do you agree with that ? " " Not necessarily , Cliff . You tell me why . " " I 'll tell you : Blann , according to your own view , was strangled by someone while he was starting to give Oliver Grayson some information over the telephone . That information had to do with the murder the night before . You heard practically the whole conversation between Oliver and Blann . Can you deny that Blann was killed so that that information would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " And do you deny that no one would commit mur-  | der on Blann other than someone who was already involved in murder ? I 've brought that angle out before . " " That does n't mean , " said Mattingly , doggedly , " that Blann might not have been killed by someone paid by the murderer to do the job . " " Which does n't change the point at all . The point is that either directly or indirectly the murderer of Bond Grayson also murdered John Blann . " Mattingly shrugged . " You want me to tear up Ambers ' confession and let him go free ? " " Oh , no . Just forget about Ambers for a minute . Just assume that you 've never heard of Ambers and listen to me . . . . The same theory , precisely , holds for the murder of Henry Flick . Grayson 's killer picked up the noon paper today and read that Flick had been caught and was coming to Baltimore to give some information to you on the Grayson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot . . . . If the news of Flick 's arrest had been kept out of the papers , Matt , he might not have been killed . " A heavy sigh escaped Mattingly . " Yes , " he said , " I was a damned fool . . . . Anyway , he told us what he knew , and what good was it ? " " What he told us was a great deal of good , Matt . Harry , do you still have your notebook with you ? " Harriett nodded , reaching for her handbag . The book was soon in her hand . " I wish you 'd read aloud just what Flick said after I asked him if he was in the building when Mr. Grayson was killed . "  | Harriett flipped the pages expertly , and began to read : " Mr. Wells : You were in the building when Mr. Grayson was killed ? " Mr. Flick : Yes . " Mr. Wells : What did you see ? " Mr. Flick : I went up the fire-escape and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his office . He was opening his safe . I watched him from the hallway . When he got it open he fell down on the desk . Funny thing , was n't it ? " Mr. Wells : Yes , it was . " " That 's enough , Harry , " said the professor , musingly . " You know , that 's very odd . Mr. Grayson opens his safe and falls down on his desk . . . . Do you think , Dr. Appleby , that he might have had a heart attack just then ? " The doctor considered . " It 's quite possible . Maybe the exertion of pulling the heavy doors open had something to do with it . Or , for that matter , a man in Mr. Grayson 's condition might have had an attack without any exertion at all . " Wells wheeled about . " Sam , you 've opened that safe often . Tell me how hard or how easy it was to swing the doors . " " It was very easy , " replied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well-built and in good condition . Almost new , in fact . I think I could open the doors with one finger . " " So there would n't be any exertion needed to open  | the safe . . . . Tell me something else , Doctor , if you will . Tell me if there was any real examination of Mr. Grayson 's body . Was anything more than a superficial examination made ? " " If you mean an autopsy , no , there was n't . " " I do n't mean an autopsy , exactly . I mean was there enough of an examination made to assure you , to your own satisfaction , that the bullet-wound itself was the actual cause of death ? " The doctor frowned thoughtfully and shrugged . " There was no reason whatever to think otherwise . I made a very careful exterior examination of his body , along with Dr. Fenby , but nothing out of the ordinary was done , as far as I know . You 'd better talk to Dr. Fenby about it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to another side of his story : " There are two more things that have never been explained , in spite of Ambers ' confession . One is that business of the will . Why did Bond Grayson draw a new one just before he was killed ? Possibly I should say : Why was he killed right after drawing a new will ? What is the connection ? Who could possibly benefit by the new will who did not benefit under the old one. ? . . . I understand , Doctor , that you witnessed the new will . Is that correct ? " Appleby nodded gravely . " It is , " he said . " I received a call from Mr. Grayson late on the afternoon  | of the day before he died . He asked me to drop in about nine that night if it was convenient . Said he had a little favor to ask of me . I got there on time , I think , and found that the favor he wanted was to have me witness his signature on a legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his will . " " Mr. Marsh was there , too , I believe ? " asked Wells . " Mr. Marsh was there . He signed as a witness also . " " Was nothing at all said that might tell you what Mr. Grayson 's reasons were for changing his will ? " Dr. Appleby was quite emphatic . " Nothing , " he said . " You left with Mr. Marsh ? " " Yes . We went down to the street together . " " Did he make any remark about the will ? " " No . We said practically nothing to each other on the way down . And once outside the building he went north , toward his home , I believe , and I went west to my office . " Wells mused a long minute . Then he went on : " The other thing that mystifies me is that damned pair of opera-glasses . What were they for in the first place , and where did they get to ? . . . Matt , you know for a fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got there ? " " Yes , " said Mattingly , and then he qualified his flat reply by saying : " They were n't on his desk when I got there unless they were underneath his body . "  | " But when you finally moved him , after doing all your preparatory work , they were n't under him , were they ? " " Well , no , they were n't . " " The body was n't left alone at any time , was it ? " " Oh , no . I did n't go out of the office until after we had moved him . " Wells looked wistfully at his empty highball glass and sighed . " Therefore it seems that the opera-glasses , which must have had some purpose in Mr. Grayson 's affairs , have disappeared entirely . . . . And the strange thing is that the glasses take on a great deal more importance by having been known to be there and having then mysteriously disappeared than if they had been found on his desk . . . . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thoughtful for such a length of time that Mattingly finally broke in : " And you believe these things prove that Ambers did n't shoot Mr. Grayson ? " His tone was a bit mocking . He chuckled derisively , and looked around the assembly as if to say : " Answer that one l Wells shook his head vehemently . " Do n't mistake me , Matt , " he said . " I 've never claimed that Ambers did n't shoot him . I simply question greatly whether he did or did not kill him ! There 's quite a difference between the two . " " Then " Mattingly was at a loss . Oliver Grayson cut in quickly : " You think he was dead  --  murdered  --  before the bullet hit him ? " He was quite incredulous .  | Wells sighed and rose and motioned to George for his hat . " Yes , " he said slowly , " that 's exactly what I think . But the trouble is , I get to that point and no farther . I 'm stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going home . " He looked up at Harriett . " Going my way ? I 'll walk home with you . " She rose quickly , almost unthinkingly , and then turned doubtfully to Oliver Grayson : " You do n't mind if I go now ? " Grayson said : " I had hoped you 'd stay a while . There 's so much to be  --  talked about . Will you wait a while ? " He made it quite clear that the invitation applied to Harriett alone . And she knew , then , that she had a momentous decision to make . And Clifford Wells knew it and said nothing ; to urge her , even to entreat her with a look , would have been unfair to her , he thought . Yet what was fairness ? Fairness to whom ? And then he did the most unfair thing he could have done . He turned from her and started for the door . " Wait , Cliff , " she cried . " I 'll go with you ! " She saw him stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Oliver Grayson once more , apologetically : " I 've had a long , long day . I think I 'd better go . Good night . . . . Good night , all , " " Good night . " Wells said nothing until they had reached the shadows of the arching trees that led to the lamp-lit street . And then he swung toward her .  | " Harry , " he said . " Harry . " " Yes , Cliff ? " " You wanted to come with me , did n't you ? " The light from the street was not so dim that he could not see her nod . And then he had folded her in his arms and would not let her go . " I wanted you to come , too , Harry , " he said . Harriett snuggled happily and said nothing . There was no need to speak . 4 . Eventually they emerged from the shadows of the trees and walked briskly , arm in arm , toward the quiet street . " Tell me , Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oliver Grayson now , after you 've seen him again . " " Must we talk about him ? I do n't want to . I want to talk of  --  ourselves . " " Sorry . " He was very stern . " Business before pleasure . " " Business ? You mean you still think he might have had something to do with the case ? Do you ? " " The murderer of Bond Grayson , my dear , and of John Blann and Henry Flick , is still at large . Who he is I have n't the faintest idea . And until I know , there 's no use closing our eyes to anything or anyone . . . . Did n't it strike you that Oliver Grayson behaved rather queerly when we met him at the prison , and while we rode home with him ? " Harriett agreed hesitantly . " Yes , " she said , " he  | did . He  --  why , he acted as though he was  --  afraid of us ! Actually afraid ! " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has something on his mind , and I think  --  I think  --  I know what it might be . " Harriett halted abruptly and looked at him with suddenly startled eyes . " Do you think we 've both been ? been wrong about him ? You say Ambers shot Mr. Grayson but did n't kill him . You think Oliver did ? " Wells grunted and gave her a gentle tug . " Come along , my dear . You 've had a busy day and you 've got to get home . . . . As a matter of fact , Harry " " As a matter of fact , what ? " Wells mused . Then : " As a matter of fact , maybe you 're right ! " And from that moment until he left her at her door ( although there was a lengthy farewell within the darkness of the vestibule ) , he said remarkably little , and Harriett knew enough not to press him . The mood that had suddenly come upon him continued as he strode along toward the University . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just got himself practically engaged to be married . He swung along rapidly , with the gait of a long-legged horse nearing oats , but with his head thrust down in thought and brow furrowed . He whistled soundlessly from pursed lips and then spoke aloud to himself in his complete ab-straction : " Something on his mind . . . worried sick . . . might have been lying about lots of things . . . suppose he got to Baltimore several hours earlier than he  | says he did ? . . . Might have , at that . . . might have had time to . . . to do what ? Hell , that 's it ! Do what ? . . . But God knows he did n't kill Blann or Flick ! . . . Aw , hell , I 'll go nuts if I do n't stop . . . but he 's worried ! . . . Here I am back where I started . . . thinking right around in circles . . . . I 'll get a good night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he did neither . He swung into the Hopkins campus and cut over the lawn through the trees that dotted its expanse , heading for the dormitories . And as he did so there was a sudden , stealthy movement behind him  --  a rustle of footsteps on the grass  --  that made him turn . He turned too late . A dark form behind him , hardly discernible in the blackness of the night , moved just once . Moved to lift an arm and fire a pistol three times in rapid succession into Clifford Wells ' tumbling body . And there was a rushing sound  --  the desperate rush of a man escaping into the thick gloom of the campus . And then  --  silence .  | CHAPTER XII 1 .

The night watchman at the dormitories heard the shots and assumed them to he the back-fire of an undergraduate 's ancient Ford . That is , he assumed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued to think it over  --  he had nothing to do but think  --  and realized at last that there was a difference . Back-fires are sharp , but not quite as sharp as that , or were they ? But do back-fires happen three times in a row like that ? In due course , after revolving the matter in his mind , he decided to take a look , anyway . Would n't hurt to stretch his legs a bit . He felt for his flashlight , and strolled out into the darkness . Come to think , now , it sounded right close . About over this way . . . . No , farther over . . . . Oh , well , guess it was a back-fire . . . . Ho , hum . What a life ! Wish I had a decent job , with something to do . Something in the daytime . . . . Holy mackerel ! What 's that ! He soon discovered what it was . He soon did more than stretch his legs a bit . He ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . .  | The Union Memorial Hospital was not far away . . . . An ambulance came clanging , and white coats hurried to the ring of awed faces around the huddling form . . . . A practised medical eye and hand looked and probed expertly and an amazed grunt came forth . . . . The stretcher was brought into use , and a siren screamed as the tires bit the graveled road . . . . And then the ambulance was gone , headed for the hospital . 2 . Lieutenant Barney Mattingly was undressing for bed after a long day . The refreshing sound of water splashing into his tub made him hum in spite of himself ; made him forget his puzzles for the time . He hummed and tugged at a recalcitrant shoe-lace . Just as it came undone the telephone rang . His humming ceased . He continued to sit on the edge of his bed , let his chin drop disconsolately into one hand and swore heavily . The telephone shrilled insistently . " Not going to answer the damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm home and I 'm going to stay home . . . . Not going to answer it ! " He reached for a stick of gum to help him keep his decision ; tore the wrapper off ; folded it and laid it on his tongue . The telephone became angry . He reached down uneasily to take his shoe off , and then , as if afraid the ringing might stop before he reached the instrument , he bounded into the next room and yanked at the receiver . " Hello ! . . . Yes , I 'm Mattingly . . . . What ? . .  | What ! . . . Oh , my God ! . . . Yes , thanks . I 'll be right over ! " Gone were his thoughts of tub and bed . He redressed frantically , running out before the job was complete , and made for the door and the street and the hospital . 3 . Harriett Fleming was dreaming when her telephone rang . Dreaming with her eyes wide open . She sat at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not noticed before how bright the stars could gleam ; how friendly , how close they were . A vagrant starlit cloud , drifting eastward idly , held her rapt and ecstatic ; whatever her eyes beheld was good , tonight . And ever and ever ? She hardly knew the ' phone had rung until her hand , by unconscious habit , grasped the receiver . " Yes ? " That was all she said . The voice of the nurse at the other end of the line tried to be kind but could only be cruel . Harriett listened and shook her head , at first , in incomprehension , and then , when comprehension came , she wavered and reached wildly to save herself from falling to the floor . The room spun and became a blurry haze . The receiver fell dangling . She was never able to recall the next quarter-hour with any clarity . Somehow she got to the street and somehow she reached the hospital . Part of the way she had run , hatless , coatless , disheveled . Part of the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not rec-  | ognize Pat as he had recognized her . Her manner of gasping the name of the hospital  --  her clear , unmistakable agony  --  kept him from making himself known . He merely helped her in and then broke every known traffic law to get her to her destination . . . . And he saw her running up the driveway and into the wide entrance doors before his wheels had ceased to turn . 4 . The nurse on duty in the accident ward was sympathetic , kindly and  --  firm . Very firm . They could not , she said , go in . " We called you , " she explained , " because he mentioned your names , over and over again . But you ca n't go in , yet . " Harriett looked at Mattingly tearfully , as if she expected him to put his shoulder to the clean white door and burst it open . Then she paced up and down the corridor , and suddenly stopped to voice the thought that had come to her : " He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man who has already killed three men ! " She broke off abjectly , and bit her lip as if in punishment for what she had said . As if she must not permit herself to think there might be a fourth . Then , plaintively , pleadingly , " Do they think  --  do they think  --  he might  --  die ? " Mattingly reassured her far more bravely than he felt : " Of course not ! Not him ! Why  --  why , he ca n't die ! He ca n't ! " Harriett could not know that he was voicing a prayer and nothing more .  | The clean white door opened , emitted a hurrying nurse , closed . The nurse would not wait for questioning , but held a brusque hand in the air as she walked away . In a moment she was back . Her face was expressionless ; told Harriett nothing . The clean white door closed torturingly . And at length it opened once more , after an agony of waiting . This time it was a surgeon who rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a cigarette . Before he could get it out Harriett and Mattingly were upon him , begging for the answer to one question . He looked up and grinned comfortingly . " Harriett Fleming and Lieutenant Mattingly , I suppose ? That 's all I 've been hearing for fifteen minutes . . . . Tell me , was this fellow , " he jerked a thumb over his shoulder , " expecting to be shot at ? " Mattingly said , " Do n't think so . Why ? " Harriett said , " How is he , please ? " The surgeon was tantalizingly slow . " Well , " he said , " it seems as though he did . Whoever it was shot him fired three times . All three bullets hit the mark . " " No , " pleaded Harriett . " Please , God ! " " Yes , sir , all three . Two in the center of the chest and close enough together to cover with your hand . The other was in his shoulder . Does n't matter much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that 's about all . But the other two , now " Yes , the other two ? " Why could n't the man hurry ? " Well , it 's funny about the other two . They 'd have  | been fatal  --  either one of them  --  if they 'd gone in , but they just knocked the wind out of him , I guess , and that 's about all . . . Must be good steel they put in those vests . " " Vests ? " " Uh , huh . Got two big dents in it , though . Still , I guess they ca n't make ' em too heavy , or they 'd weigh a ton . . . . That 's why I asked you if he was expecting to get shot at . See ? " " Then , " breathed Harriett , " you mean he 'll  --  be all right ? " " Oh , sure . Give him a couple of days to make up for the blood he lost and he 'll be out and around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a while . " Harriett had to sit down . She was suddenly weak all over , and she trembled violently and wanted to cry . And she understood , now , why the professor 's embrace , not long before , had been so strangely firm and unyielding . She might have known . But Mattingly , unaccountably , all at once became tremendously excited . He looked about frenziedly , saw the telephone on the night nurse 's desk , and startled her by grabbing it brusquely and howling a number into it . " You 're not allowed ! " she tried to protest . " Shut up ! " he yelled . " This is  --  this is life and death ! . . . Operator , hurry it up ! " Harriett stared , amazed . Was Mattingly finishing what the professor had begun ? Did he know ? " Operator ! . . . Oh , hello , Mrs. McGann ! Say , listen ! My bathtub ! A half-hour ago , I left it running !  | Shut it off ! " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 ? Pat Geare , of taxicab fame , waited patiently for Harriett to reappear  --  waited for nearly an hour . Harriett had left him unpaid , but it was n't the money so much ; he could use it nicely , of course , what with food the way it was and a numerous brood at home to consume a great deal of it . But more than the money he wanted to be of assistance if he could . Pat was like that . His acquaintanceship with Harriett , brought about by one day 's attendance at the famous Grayson trial and a little bit of testimony in Oliver Grayson 's behalf , had less to do with his desire to help her now than the knowledge that she had been distressed and had needed him . He waited to see if she would need him again . He passed time by trying out a newly-learned aria from La Giaconda , but somehow his own whistling failed to cheer him , inexplicably . He gave it up and lit a cigarette . His determination to wait for Harriett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Engaged , " was his reply , with a good-natured shake of the head . But he decided , after an hour , that too much was enough . He descended from his cab and entered the hospital to look for her . Eventually , after much of asking his way and being shunted back and forth , he found the room to which the professor had been transferred .  | He knocked politely , heard a voice bid him enter , and poked his head within inquiringly . Harriett was there at the bedside of a pale and gaunt young chap , who hardly made a hump in the covers . This chap , whoever he was , did n't move at all to show he was alive , but Pat could n't see , in the shadow thrown by the bed-lamp , that the man 's eyes were wide and bright with curiosity and wonder , and with a strange contentment in one who seemed so ill . Harriett came to the door . " Why , Pat , " she said . " What are you doing here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you I was waiting to take you back home again , when you 're ready to go , miss . " " Back home ? I do n't understand , Pat . Come inside and tell me what this is all about . " She led him first to the bed and introduced him to Wells . She mentioned the link that existed between the three of them  --  the link of common interest in the murder of Bond Grayson . Wells smiled weakly and amiably and managed to whisper : " You 're the one who whistled flute solos to Oliver Grayson the night of the murder ? " " Yes , sir , " said Pat Geare . " That 's me . " " And who did his best , " said Harriett , " to say a good word for him at the trial . " " Aw , " said Pat , embarrassed , " I knew he never done it . Knew it all th ' time . " Wells paused for strength and asked : " Why ? How did you know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fellow , see ?  | That 's why . . . . But it 's certainly funny the way I keep comin ' into this business all the time . You 're the third one mixed up in it , Miss Fleming , that 's been ridin ' with me in my cab . " " Have I been riding with you ? " " Yes 'm , " said Pat . " I brought you here tonight , see ? That 's how I 'm here now . " " And I did n't even notice you . " " No 'm . You were in right much of a terrible stew , and I guess you did n't look at me . Everything all right now ? " " Everything , Pat . " Harriett laid a hand caressingly on Clifford Wells ' good shoulder . " Everything ! . . . But tell me who the third person was . Who has ridden with you besides Mr. Grayson , that night , and I ? " " The doctor chap . ' Bout a couple o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact . Somewhere around twelve o'clock . Wanted to go to North Avenue and Charles Street . " " Sick call , I suppose , " said Harriett . Wells squirmed a bit and swore politely , beneath his breath , at his shoulder . " Yes 'm , I guess , " said Pat , although Harriett seemed more intent on looking worriedly at Wells than in listening to his reply . " Was n't in any hurry , though . Went into an ice cream store first . Right hot that day , if you remember . " " Ice cream , " said Harriett . " How 'd you like to have some , Cliff ? Would you like me to send Pat out to get some for you ? "  | " No , thanks , " said Wells , grimacing . Harriett moved purposefully . " All right , Pat . Now we 'll go . Mr. Wells is going to sleep . " " Maybe , " said Mr. Wells . " This damned shoul-der " That damned shoulder , " said Harriett , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She leaned down and kissed him possessively . " Good-bye . See you in the morning . " " In the morning , " he said .  | CHAPTER XIII 1 . THANK Heaven it was my left shoulder that got plugged and not my right , or I should have to forget about this crazy idea of writing the facts to date in this case and confine myself to simply thinking about them . But as it is , I can lie back here and think and then pin my thoughts on paper , as it were , before they disappear without a trace . The beauty of this method is that I can force myself to think with some degree of order rather than in helter-skelter fashion , which would probably lead nowhere . So here goes . If Harriett catches me at it I suppose she 'll make me quit . However , she is at work now and wo n't be back until after noon . There 's one thing that amazes me . The loss of a bit of blood seems to have had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't remember ever feeling so extraordinarily clear and wise and wide-awake as I now do . My body simply rests here against a pile of pillows , weak as the devil but quite at ease and unnoticed , but my mind is miles ahead of me , and urges me to think , think , think . Maybe the habit of bleeding people in the old days was n't such a bad idea after all . I want to go back , now , and assemble the facts I have in a sort of general summary , just to see where the  | case stands at present . If I felt right now as I did last night at Oliver Grayson 's home , I 'd probably drop the whole damned affair . I was thoroughly discouraged . I was ready to give it up entirely , take Grayson 's ten thousand dollars and sneak off with it like a dog with a steak from the table . But two things have happened since then to change my mind . One is , of course , that I 've been pounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm sure it was he . Therefore I 've been given a bit of personal interest in this affair , instead of merely standing on the sidelines trying to guess the identity of the man who had killed three people I did n't know and did n't care to know . It 's different , now . The other reason is Harriett . I feel that she can never be really happy and content  --  with me or with anyone else  --  as long as this business remains unsolved . I do n't mean that she would be actively worried over it enough to make her ill or anything of that sort , but I do mean that she would never be entirely at ease , subconsciously . I am quite certain that someone who took that lie-detector test  --  besides Jordan Ambers  --  is a murdering beast , and I think Harry knows it , too . Which means she must realize that someone she knows , possibly someone she considers a friend , has the blood of three men on his hands . And she must wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's why he must be found . I noticed that I have written of the " fourth " quite offhandedly , but I realize very well that if there is a  | fourth it will be myself . That was made plain last night . Will he try again , sometime ? It seems clear that our man will not stop short of the murder of anyone who becomes dangerous to him . Poor man ! I pity him , really . He must live in a constant hell . He must be fairly quivering with the eagerness to learn what steps are being taken to unmask him , and to take steps himself to prevent it . And above all that he must live his natural life and never show his inward seething . Yes , I pity him . 2 . Every few minutes I am compelled to stop writing for a while and rest my hand . I am as weak as water . Yet the urge I have to set this stuff down remains . So if the nurse will keep my pencil sharpened and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . I see this case now as though for the first time I were standing off and looking at it wholly and completely ? except for the last blank chapter . I am looking at it as a single and thoroughly horrible piece of work . And the non-essentials of the affair are at last recognizable as non-essentials , leaving the basic structure bare and unsightly  --  and meaningless , so far . The non-essentials comprise that queer disappearance and reappearance of the fifty thousand dollars , for one thing , as well as Jordan Ambers ' activities and that business of Flick and Blann leagued together in the drilling of Bond Grayson 's safe . The money I think I know about fully . When John  | Blann discovered his boss 's dead body that night , I think he overcame his surprise and horror long enough to look well into the open safe before calling the police . In doing so he came across a pile of money and probably hid it somewhere so that he could pick it up when he went off duty . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police came . The money he got , however , was only a part of the whole fifty thousand . He got forty-eight one-grand notes , with a one-dollar note on each end of the pile . Now , Sam Peterson was positive that altogether there were fifty ones and fifty grands in the safe . Therefore it would seem logical that the rest of the money consisted of forty-eight ones with a thousand on each end . It would look a whole lot more valuable than the other pile , and would be much less valuable . And it would , I am sure , he in the front , easily seen , while the other was back and harder to find . It was bait . Bait for whom ? For what purpose ? Did Bond Grayson expect to be robbed that night ? Did he expect to be held up at the point of a gun ? Or did he simply divide the money that way to play safe ? We know that he was ready to pay fifty thousand dollars to young Ambers for his stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gyp him  --  pass a counterfeit certificate or something of that sort . Or he may have been guarding against Todd Spurrier . Who knows ? At any rate , whatever the reason may have been for
