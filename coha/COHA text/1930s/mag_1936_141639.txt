In June 1935 svelte , socialite Mrs. Helen Appleton Read , lecturer and long-time art critic of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle , sailed to Germany to organize a monumental loan exhibition of German art for the U. S. with the backing of the Carl Schurz Memorial Foundation and the Oberlaender Trust . Nazi officials at first were suspicious , but Mrs. Read had a fine argument for Minister for Propaganda Goebbels and Minister for Culture Rust : the French Government had won great and favorable publicity in the U. S. by loan exhibits of the 18th-Century French masters . Would Germany do less ? <P> In June 1936 Mrs. Read went abroad to arrange final details . The exhibition was originally entitled " German Art from the 19th to the 20th Century . " However , since practically every important German painter of the past 35 years has been driven from the country , Mrs. Read sidestepped an embarrassing situation by ending her choice of pictures in the 1870 's , at the birth of the German Empire . An itinerary was chosen , and last week the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. opened in Philadelphia at the Pennsylvania Museum of Art . <P> In fact , the German show opened with more of a bang than was intended . At the last moment lawyers discovered that , though property of German individuals and of the German Reich was safe from legal action , holders of defaulted German municipal bonds might possibly be able to seize pictures belonging to German municipal museums . Twenty-six pictures were hastily withdrawn , including two fine Holbeins , a Durer , three Altdorfers and two portraits by famed Bartholomaeus Bruyn . In the 81 paintings and 150 drawings left , there was still enough to make the show one of the most important of the 1936 season . Possibly the high spot of the whole exhibit is Lucas Cranach 's famed Venus und Amor , the property of the Nurnberg National Museum . On this panel medieval Artist Cranach shows a slim Venus , draped in a diaphanous veil wagging a warning finger at a pug-nosed Cupid who has pulled a honeycomb from a tree , and suffered severe bee stings as a result .

Sic Etiam Nobis Brevis et Peritura Voluptas Quam Petimus Tristi Mixta Dolore Nocet. * Because of the retreat of many of the best early paintings , the show leans heavily on the mystical 19th Century Romantics that for a brief while made Munich an art centre almost equal to Paris and Rome , profoundly influenced U. S. painters of the " Hudson River School " and the stolid portraitists that followed them . Other noteworthy pictures included : <P> A magnificent Coronation of the Virgin by Cologne 's unknown Master of the Life of Mary , in which the Virgin , crowned by God and Jesus Christ , is surrounded by a full orchestra of Angels , playing psalteries , sackbuts , harps , lutes and viols . <P> A charcoal portrait of a man by Albrecht Diirer . <P> A portrait of two long-necked sisters , in the manner of David , by Sculptor Johann Gottfried Schadow , famed as the creator of the galloping chariot on top of Berlin 's Brandenburg Gate .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
