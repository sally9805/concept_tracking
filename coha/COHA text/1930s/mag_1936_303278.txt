To the earnest Brooklyn physicians who invited him to tell them about vitamins last week , Johns Hopkins ' Nutritionist Elmer Verner McCollum was a demigod who enabled doctors and druggists to profit from the vitamin business . When he finished speaking they beamed less amiably at him . For Dr. McCollum debunked some of the claims made for some of the vitamins . <P> Vitamin A , of which he was one of the discoverers , received his specific denunciation . It does help the body of children to grow . It does help prevent eye diseases . But , said Dr. McCollum , Vitamin A does not directly prevent colds as many manufacturers of candies and drugs claim . The only effect Vitamin A has on colds is to increase secretions from mucous membranes of nose and throat . Those secretions kill invading germs , may prevent a cold , if germs actually cause colds . His advice was not to drink cod-liver oil , in which Vitamin A is usually sold , as a cold-preventive.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
