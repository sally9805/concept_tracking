AFTER MANY A SUMMER A NOVEL IN FIVE PARTS ? PART TWO BY ALDOUS HUXLEY y REMY had dressed again and was sitting in the subterranean storeroom that was to serve as his study . The dry acrid dust of old documents had gone to his head , like a kind of intoxicating snuff . His face was flushed as he prepared his files and sharpened his pencils ; his bald head shone with perspiration ; behind their bifocal lenses , his eyes were bright with excitement . There ! Everything was ready . He turned round in his swivel chair and sat for a little while quite still , voluptuously savoring his anticipations . Tied up in innumerable brown paper parcels , the Hauberk Papers awaited their first reader . Twenty-seven crates of still unravished brides of quietness . He smiled to himself at the thought that he was to be their Bluebeard . Thousands of brides of quietness accumulated through centuries by successive generations of indefatigable Hauberks . Hauberk after Hauberk ; barony after knighthood ; earldom after barony ; and then Earl of Gonister after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And , after the eighth , nothing but death duties and an old house and two old spinster ladies , sinking ever deeper into solitude and eccentricity , into poverty and family pride , but finally , poor pets ! more deeply into poverty than pride . They had sworn they would never sell ; but in the end they had accepted Mr. Stoyte 's offer . The papers had been shipped to California . They would be able now to buy them-selves a couple of really sumptuous funerals . And that would be the end of the Hauberks . Delicious fragments of English history ! Cautionary perhaps or perhaps , and more probably , merely senseless , merely a tale told by an idiot . A tale of cutthroats and conspirators , of patrons of learning and shady speculators , of bishops and kings ' catamites and minor poets , of admirals and pimps , of saints and heroines and nymphomaniacs , of imbeciles and prime ministers , of art collectors and sadists . And here was all that remained of them , in twenty-seven crates , higgledy-piggledy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gloating over his treasure , Jeremy forgot the fatigues of the journey , forgot Los Angeles and the chauffeur , forgot the cemetery and the castle , forgot even Mr. Stoyte . He had the Hauberk Papers , had them all to himself . Like a child dipping blindly into a bran pie for a present which he knows will be exciting , Jeremy picked up one of the brown paper parcels with which the first crate was filled and cut the string . What rich confusion awaited him within ! A book of household accounts for the year 1576 and 1577 ; a narrative by some Hauberk cadet of Sir Kenelm Digby 's expedition to Scanderoon ; eleven letters in Spanish from Miguel de Molinos to that Lady Ann Hauberk who had scandalized her family by turning papist ; a collection , in early eighteenth-century handwriting , of sickroom recipes ; a copy of Drelincourt 's On Death ; and an odd volume of Andr6a the Nerciat 's Fdicia , ou , vies Fredaines . He had just cut the string of the second bundle and was wondering whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Third Earl 's holograph , " Reflections of the Late Popish Plot , " when there was a knock at the door . He looked up and saw a small , dark man in a white overall advancing toward him . The stranger smiled , said , " Do n't let me disturb you , " but nevertheless disturbed him . " My name 's Obispo , " he went on , " Dr. Sigmund Obispo . Physician in ordinary to His Majesty King Stoyte the First  --  and let 's hope also the last . " Evidently delighted by his own joke , he broke into a peal of startlingly loud , metallic laughter . Then , with the elegantly fastidious gesture of an aristocrat in a dust heap , he picked up one of Molinos 's letters and started , slowly , and out loud , to decipher the first line of the flowing seventeenth-century calligraphy that met his eyes . " ' Arne a Dios cam es en si y no como se to dice y forma su imagination . ' " He looked up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , I should think . Why , you ca n't even love a woman as she is in herself ; and after all , there is some sort of objective physical basis for the phenomenon we call a female . A pretty nice basis in some cases . Whereas poor old Dios is only a spirit  --  in other words , pure imagination . And here 's this idiot , whoever he is , telling some other idiot that people must n't love God as He is in their imagination . " Once again self-consciously the aristocrat , he threw down the letter with a contemptuous flick of the wrist . " What drivel it all is ! " he went on . " A string of words called religion . Another string of words called philosophy . Half a dozen other strings called political ideals . And all the words either ambiguous or meaningless . And people getting so excited about them they 'll murder their neighbors for using a word they do n't happen to like . Do n't you pine for some sense once in a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " One does n't bother too much about the meanings , " he said . Then , anticipating further criticism by disparaging himself and the things he loved most dearly , " One gets a lot of fun , you know , " he went on ; " just scrabbling about in the dust heaps . " Dr. Obispo laughed and patted Jeremy encouragingly on the shoulder . " Good for your he said . " You 're frank . I like that . Most of the Ph.D . boys one meets are such damned Pecksniffs . Trying to pull that high-moral culture stuff on you ! You know : wisdom rather than knowledge ; Sophocles instead of science . Funny , ' I always say to them when they try that on me , ' funny that the thing you get your income from should happen to be the thing that 's going to save humanity . ' Whereas you do n't try to glorify your little racket . You 're honest . You admit you 're in the thing merely for the fun of it . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the fun . Though of course if you 'd given me any of that Sophocles stuff , I 'd just have let you have my piece about science and progress , science and happiness , even science and ultimate truth , if you 'd been obstinate . " He showed his white teeth in a happy derision of everybody . " Mind you , " Dr. Obispo went on , " I 'm not entirely blind to the charms of your racket . I 'd draw the line at Sophocles of course . And I 'd be deadly bored with this sort of stuff . " He nodded toward the twenty-seven crates . " But I must admit , " he concluded handsomely , " I 've had a lot of fun out of old books in my time . Really , a lot of fun . " He rose to his feet . " I 'd like to show you my laboratory , " he said . " There 's plenty of time before lunch . " Jeremy would have liked of course to go on unpacking the Hauberk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he rose obediently and followed Dr. Obispo toward the door . Longevity , the doctor explained , as they left the room . That was his subject . Had been ever since he left medi-cal school . But of course , so long as lie was in practice , he had n't been able to do any serious work on it . Practice was fatal to serious work , he added parenthetically . How could you do anything sensible when you had to spend all your time looking after patients ? Patients belonged to three classes : those that imagined they were sick , but were n't ; those that were sick , but would get well anyhow ; those that were sick and would be much better dead . For anybody capable of serious work to waste his time with patients was simply idiotic . And of course nothing but economic pressure would ever have driven him to do it . And he might have gone on in that groove forever  --  wasting himself on morons . But then , quite suddenly , his luck had turned . Jo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positively providential . Jo Stoyte , Dr. Obispo repeated , Jo Stoyte on the verge of breaking up completely . Forty pounds overweight and having had a stroke . Not a bad one luckily ; but enough to put the old bastard into a sweat . Talk of being scared of death ! ( Dr. Obispo 's white teeth flashed again in wolfish good humor . ) In Jo 's case it had been a panic . Out of that panic had come Dr. Obispo 's liberation from his patients ; had come his income , his laboratory for work on the problems of longevity , his excellent assistant ; had come too the financing of that pharmaceutical work at Berkeley , of those experiments with monkeys in Brazil , of that expedition to study the tortoises on the Galapagos Islands . Everything a research worker could ask for , with old Jo himself thrown in as the perfect guineapig  --  ready to submit to practically anything short of vivisection without anaesthetics , provided it offered some hope of keeping him above ground a few years longer . Not that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . Just keeping his weight down , and taking care of his kidneys , and pepping him up with periodic shots ofsynthetic sex hormone , and watching out for those arteries . The ordinary , common-sense treatment for a man of Jo Stoyte 's age and medical history . Meanwhile , however , he was on the track of something new , something that promised to be important . In a few months , perhaps in a few weeks , he 'd be in a position to make a definite pronouncement . " That 's very interesting , " said Jeremy with hypocritical politeness . They were walking along a narrow corridor , whitewashed and bleakly illuminated by a series of electric bulbs . Through open doors , Jeremy had occasional glimpses of vast cellars crammed with totem poles and armor , with stuffed orang-utans and marble groups by Thorwaldsen , with gilded Bodhisattvas and early steam engines , with lingams and stage coaches and Peruvian pottery , with crucifixes and mineralogical specimens . Dr. Obispo , meanwhile , had begun to talk again about longevity . The subject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A lot of observations without any explanatory hypothesis . A mere chaos of facts . And what odd , what essentially eccentric facts ! What was it , for example , that made a cicada live as long as a bull ? Or a canary outlast three generations of sheep ? Why should dogs be senile at fourteen and parrots sprightly at a hundred ? Why should female humans become sterile in the forties , while female crocodiles continued to lay eggs into their third century ? Why in heaven 's name should a pike live to two hundred without showing any signs of senility ? Whereas poor old Jo Stoyte . Dr. Obispo halted at last . " Here we are , " he said , opening a door . A smell of mice and absolute alcohol floated out into the corridor . " Come on in , " he said cordially . Jeremy entered . There were the mice all right  --  cage upon cage of them , in tiers along the wall directly in front of him . To the left , three windows , hewn in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant panorama of orange trees and mountains . Seated at a table in front of one of these windows , a man was looking through a microscope . He raised his fair , tousled head as they approached and turned toward them a face of almost childlike candor and openness . " Hullo , doc , " he said with a charming smile . " My assistant , " Dr. Obispo explained , " Peter Boone . Pete , this is Mr. Fordage . " Pete rose and revealed himself an athletic young giant . " Call me Pete , " he said , when Jeremy had called him Mr. Boone . " Everyone calls me Pete . " Jeremy wondered whether he ought to invite the young man to call him Jeremy ? but wondered , as usual , so long that the appropriate moment for doing so passed , irrevocably . " Pete 's a bright boy , " Dr. Obispo began again in a tone that was affectionate in intention , but a little patronizing in fact . " Knows his physiology , Good with his hands too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patted the young man on the shoulder . Pete smiled  --  a little uncomfortably , it seemed to Jeremy , as though he found it rather difficult to make the right response to the other 's cordiality . " Takes his politics a bit too seriously , " Dr. Obispo went on . " That 's his only defect . Pm trying to cure him of that . Not very successfully so far , I 'm afraid . Eh , Pete ? " The young man smiled again , more confidently ; this time he knew exactly where he stood and what to do . " Not very successfully , " he echoed . Then , turning to Jeremy , " Did you see the Spanish news this morning ? " he asked . The expression on his large , fair , open face changed to one of concern . Jeremy shook his head . " It 's something awful , " said Pete gloomily . " When I think of those poor devils without planes or artillery or . . . " " Well , do n't think of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel better . " The young man looked at him , then looked away again without saying any-thing . After a moment of silence he pulled out his watch . " I think I 'll go and have a swim before lunch , " he said and walked toward the door . Dr. Obispo picked up a cage of mice and held it within a few inches of Jeremy 's nose , " These are the sex-hormone boys , " he said with a jocularity that the other found curiously offensive . The animals squeaked as he shook the cage . " Lively enough while the effect lasts . The trouble is that the effects are only temporary . " Not that temporary effects were to be despised , he added , as he replaced the cage . It was always better to feel temporarily good than temporarily bad . That was why he was giving old Jo a course of that testosterone stuff . Not that the old bastard had any great need of it with that Maunciple girl around .... Dr. Obispo suddenly put his hand over his mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " he 's out of the room . Poor old Pete ! " A derisive smile appeared on his face . " Is he in love ? " He tapped his forehead . " Thinks she 's like something in the works of Tennyson . You know , chemically pure . Last month he nearly killed a man for suggesting that she and the old boy .. . Well , you know . God knows what he figures the girl is doing here . Telling Uncle Jo about the spiral nebulae , I suppose . Well , if it makes him happy to think that way , I 'm not the one that 's going to spoil his fun . " Dr. Obispo laughed indulgently . " But to come back to what I was saying about Uncle Jo . . " Just having that girl around the house was the equivalent of a hormone treatment . But it would n't last . It never did . Brown-Sequard and Voronoff and all the rest of them  --  they 'd been on the wrong track . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of senility . Whereas it was only one of the symptoms . Senescence started somewhere else and involved the sex mechanism along with the rest of the body . Hormone treatments were just palliatives and pick-me-ups . Helped you for a time , but did n't prevent your growing old . Jeremy stifled a yawn . For example , Dr. Obispo went on , why should some animals live much longer than human beings and yet show no signs of old age ? Somehow , somewhere we had made a biological mistake . Crocodiles had avoided that mistake ; so had tortoises . The same was true of certain species of fish . " Look at this , " he said ; and , crossing the room , he drew back a rubber curtain , revealing as he did so the glass front of a large aquarium recessed into the wall . Jeremy approached and looked in . In the green and shadowy translucence two huge fish hung suspended , their snouts almost touching , motionless except for the occasional ripple of a fin and the rhythmic panting of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rosary of bubbles streamed ceaselessly up toward the light and all around them the water was spasmodically silver . with the darlings of smaller fish . Sunk in their mindless ecstasy , the monsters paid no attention . Carp , Dr. Obispo explained ; carp from the fish ponds of a castle in Franconia  --  he had forgotten the name ; but it was somewhere near Bamberg . The family was impoverished ; but the fish were heirlooms , unpurchasable . Jo Stoyte had had to spend a lot of money to have these two stolen and smuggled out of the country in a specially constructed automobile with a tank under the back seats . Sixty pounders they were ; over four feet long ; and those rings in their tails were dated 1761 . There they were , Dr. Obispo said , pointing at the huge fish , nearly two hundred years old , perfectly healthy , no symptoms of senility , no apparent reason why they should n't go on for another three or four centuries . There they were ; and here were you . He turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than middle-aged , but already bald , already long-sighted and short-winded ; already more or less edentate ; incapable of prolonged physical exertion ; chronically constipated ( could you deny it ? ) ; your memory already not so good as it was ; your digestion capricious ; your potency falling off , if it had n't , indeed , already disappeared for good . Jeremy forced himself to smile and , at every fresh item , nodded his head in what was meant to look like an amused assent . Inwardly he was writhing with a mixture of distress at this all too truthful diagnosis and anger against the diagnostician for the ruthlessness of his scientific detachment . Talking with a humorous self-deprecation about one 's own advancing senility was very different from being bluntly told about it by someone who took no interest in you except as an animal that happened to be unlike a fish . Nevertheless he continued to nod and smile . Here you were , Dr. Obispo repeated at the end of his diagnosis , and there were the carp . How was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they did ? Just where and how and why did you make the mistake that had already robbed you of your teeth and hair and would bring you in a very few years to the grave ? Old Metchnikoff had asked those questions and made a bold attempt to answer . Wrong , yes , in supposing that it was all a matter of intestinal stasis and autointoxication . But probably right in thinking that the secret was somewhere down there , in the gut . Somewhere in the gut , Dr. Obispo repeated ; and , what was more , he believed that he was on its track . He drew the curtain on his fish , took Jeremy by the arm and led him back to the mice . " Look at those , " he said , pointing to a batch of cages on an upper shelf . Jeremy looked . The mice in question were exactly like all other mice . " What 's wrong with them ? " he asked . Dr. Obispo laughed . " If those ani- , r ? - , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UTTir. ? ? mals were human beings , " he said dramatically , " they 'd all be over a hundred years old . " And he began to talk , very rapidly and excitedly , about fatty alcohols and the intestinal flora of carp . For the secret was thcrc , the key to the whole problem of senility and longevity . There , between the sterols and the peculiar flora of the carp 's intestine . Could the intestinal flora of a carp be transferred to the gut of a mammal ? And , if transferable , would it achieve the same chemical and biological results ? That was what he had been trying , for the past few months , to discover . With no success to begin with . Recently , however , they had experimented with a new technic  --  a technic that protected the flora from the processes of digestion , gave it time to adapt itself to the unfamiliar conditions . It had taken root . The effect on the mice had been immediate and significant . Senescence had been halted , even reversed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been for at least eighteen months  --  younger at the equivalent of a hundred than they had been at the equivalent of sixty . Outside in the corridor an electric bell began to ring . It was lunch time . The two men left the room and walked toward the elevator . Dr. Obispo went on talking . Mice , he said , were apt to be a bit deceptive . He had now begun to try the thing out on larger animals . If it worked all right on dogs and baboons it ought to work on Uncle Jo . VI In the small dining room most of the furnishings came from the Pavilion at Brighton . Four gilded dragons supported the red lacquered table and two more served as caryatids on either side of a chimney piece in the same material . Dr. Herbert Mulge , Ph.D. , D.D. , Principal of Tarzana College , was talking in a rich vein of something that sounded almost like pulpit eloquence about the new Auditorium which Mr. Stoyte had just presented to the College and which was shortly to be given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome man with a voice to match  --  a voice at once sonorous and suave , unctuous and ringing . The flow of his language was slow , but steady and apparently stanchless . In phrases full of the audible equivalents of Capital Letters , he now went on to assure Mr. Stoyte and anyone else who cared to listen that it would be a Real Inspiration for the boys and girls of Tarzana to come together in the beautiful new building for their Community Activities . For Non-Denominational Worship , for example ; for the Enjoyment of the Best in Drama and Music . Yes , what an inspiration ! The name of Stoyte would be remembered with love and reverence by successive generations of the College 's Alumni and Alumnae  --  would be remembered , he might say , forever ; for the Auditorium was a monumentum aere perennius , a Footprint on the Sands of Time  --  definitely a Footprint . And now , Dr. Mulge continued , between the mouthfuls of creamed chicken , now Tarzana 's Crying Need was for a new art school . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovering , was one of the most potent of educational forces . Art was the aspect under which , in this twentieth century of ours , the Religious Spirit most clearly manifested itself . Art was the means by which Personalities could best achieve Creative Self-Expression and . . " Gripes ! " Jeremy said to himself . Peter Boone found himself separated from Virginia by the blonder of her two young friends who had come over from Hollywood to have lunch with her . He could only look at her past a foreground of rouge and eyelashes , of golden curls and a thick , almost visible perfume of gardenias . To anyone else this foreground might have seemed a bit distracting ; but for Pete it was of no more significance than the equivalent amount of mud . He was interested only in what was beyond the foreground  --  in that ex-quisitely abbreviated upper lip , in the little nose that made you want to cry when you looked at it , it was so elegant and impertinent , so ridiculous and angelic ; in that long Florentine bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened eyes with their twinkling surface of humor and their dark-blue depths of what he was sure was an infinite tenderness , a plumbless feminine wisdom . He loved her so much that , where his heart should have been , he could feel only an aching breathlessness , a cavity which she alone could fill . Meanwhile , she was talking to the blonde Foreground about that new job which the Foreground had landed with the Cosmopolis-Perlmutter Studios . The picture was called " Say It with Stockings " and the Foreground was to play the part of a rich debutante who runs away from home to make a career of her own , becomes a strip-tease dancer in a Western mining camp and finally marries a cowpuncher , who turns out to be the son of a millionaire . " Sounds like a swell story , " said Virginia . " Do n't you think so , Pete ? " Pete thought so ; he was ready to think almost anything if she wanted him to . " That reminds me of Spain , " Virginia announced . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , frantically tried to imagine what train of associations had taken her from " Say It with Stockings " to the Civil War , Virginia went on to ask the young man to tell them about what he had done in Spain ; and when he demurred , insisted  --  because it was so thrilling , because the Foreground had never heard about it , because , finally , she wanted him to . Pete obeyed . Only half articulately , in a vocabulary composed of slang and cliches , and adorned by expletives and grunts  --  the vocabulary , Jeremy reflected as he listened surreptitiously through the booming of Dr. Mulge 's eloquence , the characteristically squalid and poverty-stricken vocabulary to which the fear of being thought unsocially different or un democratically superior , or unsportingly highbrow , condemns most young Englishmen and Americans  --  he began to describe his experiences as a volunteer in the International Brigade during the heroic days of 1937 . It was a touching narrative . Through the hopelessly inadequate language , Jeremy could divine the young man 's enthusiasm for liberty and justice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nostalgia , even in the neighborhood of that short upper lip , even in the midst of an absorbing piece of scientific research , for the life of men united in devotion to a cause , made one in the face of hardship and shared danger and impending death . " Gee , " he kept repeating , " they were swell guys . " And what did he do but go and get rheumatic fever , and then myocarditiswhich meant no more active service ; no more anything except sitting around . That was why he was here , he explained apologetically . But , gee , it had been good while it lasted ! That time , for example , when he and Knud had gone out at night and climbed a precipice in the dark and taken a whole platoon of Moors by surprise and killed half a dozen of them and come back with a machine gun and three prisoners . . . . " And what is your opinion of Creative Work , Mr. Pordage ? " Surprised in flagrant inattention , Jeremy started guiltily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain a little time . " Creative work ? Well , of course one 's all for it . Definitely , " he insisted . " I 'm glad to hear you say so , " said Dr. Mulge . " Because that 's what I want at Tarzana . Creative Work  --  ever more and more Creative . Shall I tell you what is my highest ambition ? " Neither Mr. Stoyte nor Jeremy made any reply . But Dr. Mulge proceeded , nevertheless , to tell them . " It is to make of Tarzana the living Center of the New Civilization that is coming to blossom here in the West . " He raised a large fleshy hand in solemn asseveration . " The Athens of the twentieth century is on the point of emerging here , in the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area I want Tarzana to be its Parthenon and its Academe , its Stoa and its Temple of the Muses . Religion , Art , Philosophy , Science  --  I want them all to find their home in Tarzana , to radiate their influence from our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his story about the Moors and the precipice Pete became aware that only the Foreground was listening to him . Virginia 's attention had wandered , surreptitiously at first , then frankly and avowedly  --  had wandered to where , on her left , the less blonde of her two friends was having something almost whispered to her by Dr. Obispo . " What 's that ? " Virginia asked . Dr. Obispo leaned toward her and began again . The three heads , the oil-smooth black , the elaborately curly brown , the lustrous auburn , were almost touching . By the expression on their faces Pete could see that the doctor was telling one of his dirty stories . Alleviated for a moment by the smile she had given him when she asked him to tell them about Spain , the anguish in that panting void where his heart ought to have been came back with redoubled intensity . It was a complicated pain , made up of jealousy and a despairing sense of loss and personal unworthiness , of a fear that his angel was being corrupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to formulate , a fear that there was n't much further corruption to be done , that the angel was not as angelic as his love had made him assume . The flow of his narrative suddenly dried up . He was silent . " Well , what happened then ? " the Foreground inquired with an eagerness and an expression of hero-worshiping admiration that any other young man would have found delightfully flattering . He shook his head . " Oh , nothing much . " " But those Moors . . . " " Hell , " he said impatiently , " what does it matter , anyhow ? " His words were drowned by a violent explosion of laughter that sent the three conspiratorial heads , the black , the brown , the lovely auburn , flying apart from one another . He looked up at Virginia and saw a face distorted with mirth . At what ? he asked himself in agony , trying to measure the extent of her corruption ; and a kind of telescoped and synthetic memory of all the schoolboy stories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in upon him . The girls ' shrill laughter exploded with a force of hilarity proportionate to the strength of the surrounding social taboos . Mr. Stoyte turned sharply in the direction from which the noise had come . " What 's the joke ? " he asked suspiciously . He was n't going to have his Baby listen to smut . He disapproved of smut in mixed company almost as whole-heartedly as his grandmother , the Plymouth Sister , had done . " What 's all that noise about ? " It was Dr. Obispo who answered . He 'd been telling them a funny story he 'd heard over the radio , he explained with that suave politeness that was like a sarcasm . Something delightfully amusing . Perhaps Mr. Stoyte would like to have him repeat it . Mr. Stoyte grunted ferociously and turned away . A glance at his host 's scowling face convinced Dr. Mulge that it would be better to postpone discussion of the Art School to another , more propitious occasion . It was disappointing ; for it seemed to him that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things would happen . Dr. Mulge was a college president chronically in quest of endowments ; he knew all about the rich . Knew , for example , that they were like gorillas , creatures not easily domesticated , deeply suspicious , alternately bored and bad-tempered . You had to approach them with caution , to handle them gently and with a boundless cunning . And even then they might suddenly turn savage on you and show their teeth . Half a lifetime of experience with bankers and steel magnates and retired meat packers had taught Dr. Mulge to take such little setbacks as to-day 's with a truly philosophic patience . Brightly , with a smile on his large , imperial-Roman face , he turned to Jeremy . " And what do you think of our California weather , Mr. Pordage ? " he asked , Meanwhile Virginia had noticed the expression on Pete 's face and immediately divined the causes of his misery . Poor Pete ! But really if he thought she had nothing better to do than always be listening to his talk about that silly old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the same he was a nice boy ; and talk about being in love ! It was nice having people around who felt that way about you ; made you feel kind of good . Though it could be rather a nuisance sometimes . Because they got to feel they had some claim on you ; they figured they had a right to tell you things and interfere . Pete did n't do that in so many words ; but he had a way of looking at you . Poor Pete . It was tough luck on him ; but the fact was she never had been attracted by that big , fair , Cary Grant sort of boy . They just did n't appeal to her ; that was all there was to it . She liked him ; and she enjoyed his being in love with her . But that was all . VII The meal was over at last ; the party broke up . Dr. Mulge had an appointment in Pasadena to see a rubber-goods manufacturer 's widow , who might perhaps give thirty thousand dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Los Angeles for his regular Friday afternoon board meetings and business consultations . Dr. Obispo was going to operate on some rabbits and went down to the laboratory to prepare his instruments . Pete had a batch of scientific journals to look at , but gave himself , meanwhile , a few minutes of happiness in Virginia 's company . And for Jeremy of course there were the Hauberk Papers . It was with a sense of almost physical relief , a feeling that he was going home to where he belonged , that he returned to his cellar . The afternoon slipped past  --  how delightfully , how profitably ! Within three hours another batch of letters from Molinos had turned up among the account books and the business correspondence . So had the third and fourth volumes of Felicia . So had an illustrated edition of Le Portier des Carmes ; and , bound like a prayer book , so had a copy of that rarest of all works of the Divine Marquis , Les Cent-Vingt lours de Sodome . What a treasure ! Jeremy 's spirit mounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had felt up there , in the swimming pool , he smiled indulgently . Let Mr. Stoyte have all the girls he wanted ; a well-written piece of eighteenth-century pornography was better than any Mauncipie . He closed the volume he was holding . The tooled morocco was austerely elegant ; on the back , the words " The Book of Common Prayer " were stamped in a gold which the years had hardly tarnished . He put it down with the other curiosa on a corner of the table . When he had finished for the afternoon he would take the whole collection up to his bedroom . It was five o'clock ; the sun was low in the sky . Dressed in white shoes and socks , white shorts , a yachting cap , and a pink silk sweater , Virginia had come to see the feeding of the baboons . Its engine turned off , her rose-colored motor scooter stood parked at the side of the road thirty or forty feet above the cage . In company with Dr. Obispo and Pete , she had gone down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's go and rout out Mr. Pordage while we 're about it , " suggested Dr. Obispo . " Yes , let 's go and fetch old Ivory , " Virginia agreed . " He 's kind of cute , do n't you think ?

And now side , leading directly to the rock-cut let 's go back to the baboons . Come on , windows of Jeremy 's room . Virginia Mr. Pordage. " pushed open the glass door .

Guess I was in the sun too much right after lunch . Maybe I 'd better go and lie down a bit . " And affectionately but very firmly rejecting Pete 's offer to go back with her to the castle , she wheeled her scooter round , so that it faced uphill , gave the young man a last , particularly charming , almost amorous smile and look , said , " Good-by , Pete darling , " and , opening the throttle of the engine , shot off with gathering momentum and an accelerating roll of explosions up the steep curving road , out of sight . Five minutes later she was in her boudoir , fixing a chocolate and banana split at the soda fountain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de nymphe , Dr. Obispo was reading aloud and translating as he went along from the first volume of Les Cent-Vingt Jours . VIII Mr. Propter was sitting on a bench under the largest of his eucalyptus trees . To the west the mountains were already a flat silhouette against the evening sky , but in front of him to the north the upper slopes were still alive with light and shadow , with rosy gold and depths of indigo . In the foreground , the castle had put on a garment of utterly improbable splendor and romance . Mr. Prop-ter looked at it and at the hills and up through the motionless leaves of the eucalyptus at the pale sky ; then closed his eyes in preoccupation with the concrete and particular miseries of the day . He remembered his interview that morning with Hansen , who was the agent for Jo Stoytc 's estates in the valley . Hansen 's treatment of the migrants who came to pick the fruit was worse even than the average . He had taken advantage of their number and their desperate need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children were being made to work all day in the sun at the rate of two or three cents an hour . And when the day 's work was finished the homes to which they returned were a row of verminous sties in the waste land beside the bed of the river . For these sties Hansen was charging a rent of ten dollars a month . Ten dollars a month for the privilege of freezing or suffocating , of sleeping in a filthy promiscuity , of being eaten up by bedbugs and lice , of picking up ophthalmia and perhaps hookworm and amoebic dysentery . And yet Hansen was a very decent , kindly man . One who would be shocked and indignant if he saw you hurting a dog , one who would fly to the protection of a maltreated woman or a crying child . When Mr. Propter drew this fact to his attention , Hansen had flushed darkly with anger . " That 's different , " he had said . Mr. Propter had tried to find out why it was different . It was his duty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty to treat children worse than slaves and inoculate them with hookworm ? It was his duty to the estates . He was n't doing anything for himself . But why should doing wrong for someone else be different from doing wrong on your own behalf ? The results were exactly the same in either case . The vie-thus did n't suffer any less when you were doing what you called your duty than when you were acting in what you imagined might be your own interest . This time the anger had exploded in violent abuse . It was the anger , Mr. Proptcr had perceived , of the well-meaning but stupid man who is compelled against his will to ask himself indiscreet questions about what he has been doing as a matter of course . He does n't want to ask these questions because he knows that if he does he will be forced either to go on with what he is doing , but with the cynic 's awareness that he is doing wrong , or else , if he does n't want to be a cynic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring his desire to do right into harmony with the real facts as revealed in the course of self-interrogation . Well , he had n't got very far with Hansen , Mr. Propter sadly concluded . He 'd have to try again with Jo Stoyte . In the past Jo had always refused to listen , on the ground that the estates were Hansen 's business . The alibi was so convenient that it would be hard , he foresaw , to break it down . From Hansen and Jo Stoyte his thoughts wandered to that newly arrived family of transients from Kansas , to whom he had given one of his cabins . The three undernourished children , with the teeth already rotting in their mouths ; the woman , emaciated by God knew what complication of diseases , deep-sunken already in apathy and weakness ; the husband alternately resentful and self-pitying , violent and morose . He had gone with the man to get some vegetables from the garden plots and a rabbit for the family supper . Sitting there , skinning the rabbit , he had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Complaint and indignation against the wheat market , which had broken each time he had begun to do well . Against the banks he had borrowed money from and been unable to repay . Against the droughts and winds that had reduced his farm to hundred and sixty acres of dust and wilderness . Against the luck that had always been against him . Against the folks who had treated him so meanly , everywhere , all his life . Dismally familiar story ! With inconsiderable variations , he had heard it a thousand times before . Sometimes they were sharecroppers from farther south , dispossessed by the owners in a desperate effort to make the farming pay . Sometimes , like this man , they had owned their own place and been dispossessed , not by financiers , but by the forces of nature  --  forces of nature which they themselves had made destructive by tearing up the grass and planting nothing but wheat . Sometimes they had been hired men , displaced by the tractors . All of them had come to California as to a promised land ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wandering peonage and was fast transforming them into Untouchables . Only a saint , Mr. Propter reflected , only a saint could be a peon and a pariah with impunity , because only a saint would accept the position gladly and as though he had chosen it of his own free will . Puverty and suffering ennoble only when they are voluntary . By involuntary poverty and suffering men are made worse . It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for an involuntarily poor man to enter the kingdom of heaven . Here , for example , was this poor devil from Kansas . How had he reacted to involuntary poverty and suffering ? So far as Mr. Propter could judge , he was compensating himself for his misfortunes by brutality to those weaker than himself . The way he yelled at the children  --  it was an all too familiar symptom . The sound of approaching footsteps made him open his eyes . Peter Boone and that Englishman he had sat with in the car were advancing up the path toward his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand in welcome and smiled . He was fond of young Pete . There was native intelligence there and native kindliness ; there was sensitiveness , generosity , a spontaneous decency of impulse and reaction . Charming and beautiful qualities ! The pity was that by themselves and undirected as they were by a right knowledge of the nature of things , they should be so impotent for good , so inadequate to anything a reasonable man could call salvation . Fine gold , but still in the ore , unsmelted , unworked . Some day perhaps the boy would learn to use his gold . He would have to wish to learn first  --  and wish also to unlearn a lot of things he now regarded as self-evident and right . It would be hard for him , as hard , but for other reasons , as it would be for that poor fellow from Kansas . " Well , Pete , " he called , " come and sit with me here . And you 've brought Mr. Pordage ; that 's good . " He moved to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one on either side of him . " And did you meet the Ogre ? " he said to Jeremy , pointing in the direction of the castle . Jeremy made a grimace and nodded . " I remembered the name you used to call him at school , " he said . " That made it a little easier . " " Poor Jo , " said Mr. Propter . " Fat people are always supposed to be so happy . But who ever enjoyed being laughed at ? That jolly manner they sometimes have , and the jokes they make at their own expense  --  it 's just a case of alibis and prophylactics . They vaccinate themselves with their own ridicule so that they sha n't react too violently to other people 's . " Jeremy smiled . He knew all about that . " It 's a good way out of an unpleasant predicament , " he said . Mr. Propter nodded . " But unfortunately , " he said , " it did n't happen to be Jo 's way . Jo was the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fights . The kind that bullies or patronizes . The kind that boasts and shows off . The kind that buys popularity by treating the girls to icc creams , even if he has to steal a dime from his grandmother 's purse to do it . The kind that goes on stealing , even if he 's found out and gets beaten and believes it when they tell him he 'll go to hell . Poor Jo , he 's been that sort of fat boy all his life . " He pointed once again in the direction of the castle . " That 's his monument to a faulty pituitary . And talking of pituitaries , " he went on , turning to Pete , " how 's the work been going ? " Pete had been thinking gloomily of Virginia  --  wondering for the hundredth time why she had left them , whether he had done anything to offend her , whether she was really tired or if there might be some other reason . At Mr. Propter 's mention of work he looked up and his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he answered and , in quick eager phrases , strangely compounded of slang and technical terms , he told Mr. Propter aboutthe results they had already got with their mice and were beginning to get , so it seemed , with the baboons and the dogs . " And if you succeed , " Mr. Propter asked , " what happens to your dogs ? " " Why , their life 's prolonged , " Pete answered triumphantly . " Yes , yes , I know that , " said the older man . " What I meant to ask was something different . A dog 's a wolf that has n't fully developed . It 's more like the foetus of a wolf than an adult wolf ; is n't that so ? " Pete nodded . " In other words , " Mr. Propter went on , " it 's a mild , tractable animal because it has never grown up into savagery . Is n't that supposed to be one of the mechanisms of evolutionary development ? " Pete nodded again . " There 's a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutation comes along and knocks it sideways . You get a new equilibrium that happens to retard the development rate . You grow up ; but you do it so slowly that you 're dead before you 've stopped being like your **25;539;TOOLONG foetus . " " Exactly , " said Mr. Propter . " So what happens if you prolong the life of an animal that has evolved that way ? " Pete laughed and shrugged his shoulders . " Guess we 'll have to wait and see , " he said . " It would be a bit disquieting , " said Mr. Propter , " if your dogs grew back in the process of growing up . " Pete laughed again delightedly . " Think of the dowagers being chased by their own Pekinese , " he said . Mr. Propter looked at him curiously and was silent for a moment , as though waiting to see whether Pete would make any further comment . The comment did not come . " I 'm glad you feel so happy about it , " he said . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember rightly , Mr. Pordagc , " he went on , " it is not growing like a tree in bulk doth make men better be . " " Or standing long an oak , three hundred years , " said Jeremy , smiling with the pleasure which an apt quotation always gave him . " What shall we all be doing at three hundred ? " Mr. Propter speculated . " Do you suppose you 'd still he a scholar and a gentleman ? " Jeremy coughed and patted his bald head . " One will certainly have stopped being a gentleman , " he answered . " One 's begun to stop even now , thank heaven . " " But the scholar will stay the course ? " " There 's a lot of books in the British Museum . " " And you , Pete ? " said Mr. Propter . " Do you suppose you 'll still be doing scientific research ? " " Why not ? What 's to prevent you from going on with it forever ? " the young man answered emphatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't think you 'd get a bit bored ? One experiment after another . Or one book after another , " he added in an aside to Jeremy . " In general , one damned thing after another . You do n't think that would prey on your mind a bit ? " " I do n't see why , " said Pete . " Time does n't bother you then ? " Pete shook his head . " Why should it ? " " Why should n't it ? " said Mr. Propter , smiling at him with an amused affection . " Time 's a pretty bothersome thing , you know . " " Not if you are n't scared of dying or growing old . " " Yes , it is , " Mr. Propter insisted ; " even if you 're not scared . It 's night- marish in itself intrinsically nightmar-ish , if you see what I mean . " " Intrinsically ? " Pete looked at him perplexed . " I do n't get it , " he said . " Intrinsically nightmarish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tense of course , " Jeremy put in . " But if one takes it in the fossil state  --  in the form of the Hauberk Papers , for example . . . " He left the sentence unfinished . " Oh , pleasant enough , " said Mr. Propter , agreeing with . his implied con-elusion . " But after all , history is n't the real thing . Past time is only evil at a distance ; and of course the study of past time is itself a process in time . Cataloguing hits of fossil evil can never he more than an ersatz for the experience of eternity . " He glanced curiously at Pete , wondering how the boy would respond to what he was saying . Plunging like this into the heart of the matter , beginning at the very care and center of the mystery  --  it was risky ; there was a danger of evoking nothing but bewilderment , or alternatively nothing but angry derision . Pete 's , he could see , was more nearly the first reaction ; but it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked as though he wanted to find out what it was all about . Meanwhile Jeremy had begun to feel that this conversation was taking a most undesirable turn . " What precisely are we supposed to be talking about ? " he asked acidulously . " The New Jerusalem ? " Mr. Propter smiled at him good-humoredly . " It 's all right , " he said . " I wo n't say a word about harps or wings . " " Well , that 's something , " said Jeremy . " I never could get much satisfaction out of meaningless discourse . " Mr. Prop-ter continued . " I like the words I use to bear some relation to facts . That 's why I 'm interested in eternity  --  psychological eternity . Because it 's a fact . " " For you perhaps , " said Jeremy in a tone which implied that more civilized people did n't suffer from these hallucinations . " For anyone who chooses to fulfil the conditions under which it can be experienced . " " And why should anyone choose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to Athens to see the Parthenon ? Because it 's worth the bother . And the same is true of eternity . The experience of timeless good is worth all the trouble it involves . " . " Timeless good , " Jeremy repeated with distaste . " I do n't know what the words mean . " " Why should you ? " said Mr. Propter . " One does n't know the full meaning of the word ' Parthenon ' until one has actually seen the thing . " " Yes , but at least I 've seen photographs of the Parthenon , I 've read descriptions . " " You 've read descriptions of timeless good , " Mr. Propter answered . " Dozens of them . In all the literatures of philosophy and religion . You 've read them , but you 've never bought your ticket for Athens . " In a resentful silence Jeremy had to admit to himself that this was true . The fact that it was true made him disapprove of the conversation even more profoundly than he had done before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying to Pete , " what is it , in this particular context , but the medium in which evil propagates itself , the element in which evil lives and outside of which it dies ? Indeed , it 's more than the element of evil , more than merely its medium . If you carry your analysis far enough you 'll find that time is evil . One of the aspects of its essential substance . " Jeremy listened with growing discomfort and a mounting irritation . His fears had been justified ; the old boy was launching out into the worst kind of theology . Eternity , timeless experience of good , time as the substance of evil  --  it was bad enough , God knew , in books ; but , fired at you like this , point blank by somebody who really took it seriously , why , it was really frightful . Why on earth could n't people live their lives in a rational , civilized way ? Why could n't they take things as they came ? Breakfast at nine , lunch at one-thirty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk with Mr. Gladstone , the Yorkshire terrier . And the library ; the Works of Voltaire in eighty-three volumes ; the inexhaustible treasure of Horace Walpole ; and for a change the " Divine Comedy " ; and then in case you might be temptedto take the Middle Ages too seriously , Salimbene 's autobiography and the " Miller 's Tale . " And sometimes calls in the afternoon  --  the Rector , Lady Fredegond with her ear trumpet , Mr. Veal . And political discussions  --  except that in these last months , since the Anschluss and Munich , one had found that political discussion was one of the unpleasant things it was wise to avoid . And the weekly journey to London , with lunch at the Reform , and always dinner with old Thripp of the British Museum ; and a chat with one 's poor brother Tom at the Foreign Office ( only that too was rapidly becoming one of the things to be avoided ) . And then of course the London Library , and Vespers at Westminster Cathedral , if they happened to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and six-thirty , an hour and a half with Mac or Doris in their fiat in Maida Vale . Infinite squalor in a little room , as he liked to call it ; abysmally delightful . Those were the things that came ; why could n't they take them , quietly and sensibly ? But no , they had to gibber about eternity and all the rest . That sort of stuff always made Jeremy want to be blasphemous . IX " Time and craving , " said Mr. Prep-ter , " craving and time  --  two aspects of the same thing ; and that thing is the raw material of evil . So you see , Pete , " he added in another tone , " you see what a queer sort of present you 'll be making us if you 're successful in your work . Another century or so of time and craving . A couple of extra lifetimes of potential evil . " " And potential good , " the young man insisted with a note of protest in his voice . " And potential good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far remove from that extra time you 're giving us . " " Why do you say that ? " Pete asked . " Because potential evil is in time ; potential good is n't . The longer you live , the more evil you automatically come into contact with . Nobody comes automatically into contact with good . Men do n't find more good by merely existing longer . It 's curious , " he went on reflectively , " that people should always have concentrated on the problem of evil . Exclusively . As though the nature of good were something self-evident . But it is n't self-evident . There 's a problem of good at least as difficult as the problem of evil . " " And what 's the solution ? " Pete asked . " The solution is very simple and profoundly unacceptable . Actual good is outside time . " " But if it 's outside time , then . " " . .. then nothing within time can be actual good . Time is potential evil , and craving converts the potentiality into actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than potentially good , with a potentiality , what 's more , that ca n't be actualized except out of time . " " But inside time , here  --  you know , just doing the ordinary things  --  hell ! we do sometimes do right . What acts are good ? " " Strictly speaking , none , " Mr. Propter answered . " But in practice , I think one 's justified in applying the word to certain acts . Any act that contributes toward the liberation of those concerned in it  --  I 'd call it a good act . " " Liberation ? " the young man repeated dubiously . The words , in his mind , carried only economic and revolutionary connotations . But it was evident that Mr. Propter was n't talking about the necessity for getting rid of capitalism . " Liberation from what ? " " Liberation from time . Liberation from craving and revulsion . Liberation from personality . " " But , heck , " said Pete , " you 're always talking about democracy . Does n't that mean respecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed . " Respecting it in order that it may be able to transcend itself . Slavery and fanaticism intensify the obsession withtime and evil and the self . Hence the value of democratic institutions and a skeptical attitude of mind . The more you respect a personality , the better its chance of discovering that all personality is a prison . Potential good is anything that helps you to get out of prison . Actualized good lies outside the prison , in timelessness , in the state of pure , disinterested consciousness . " " I 'm not much good at abstractions , " said the young man . " Let 's take some concrete examples . What about science , for instance ? Is that good ? " " Good , bad , and indifferent , according to how it 's pursued and what it 's used for . Good , bad , and indifferent , first of all , for the scientists themselves  --  just as art and scholarship may be good , bad , or indifferent for artists and scholars . Good if it facilitates liberation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it makes liberation more difficult by intensifying the obsession with personality . And , remember , the apparent selflessness of the scientist , or the artist , is not necessarily a genuine freedom from the bondage of personal ty . Scientists and artists are men devoted to what we vaguely call an ideal . But what is an ideal ? An ideal is merely the projection , on an enormously enlarged scale , of some aspect of personality . " " Say that again , " Pete requested , while even Jeremy so far forgot his pose of superior detachment as to lend his most careful attention . Mr. Propter said it again . " And that 's true , " he went on , " of every ideal except the highest , which is the ideal of liberation  --  liberation from personality , liberation from time and craving , liberation into union with God , if you do n't object to the word , Mr. Pordage . Many people do , " he added . " It 's one of the words that the Mrs. Grundys of the intellect find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I can . Well , to return to our idealist , " he continued , glad to see that Jeremy had been constrained , in spite of himself , to smile . " If he serves any ideal except the highest  --  whether it 's the artist 's ideal of beauty , or the scientist 's ideal of truth , or the humanitarian 's ideal of what currently passes for goodness  --  he 's not serving God ; he 's serving a magnified aspect of himself . He may be completely devoted ; but , in the last analysis , his devotion turns out to be directed toward an aspect of his own personality . His apparent selflessness is really not a liberation from his ego , but merely another form of bondage . This mcans that science may be bad for scientists even when it appears to be a deliverer . And the same holds good of art , of scholarship , of humanitarianism . " " And what about other people ? " Pete was saying . " People who are n't scientists . Has n't it helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And it has also helped to tie them more closely to themselves . And what 's more , I should guess that it has increased bondage more than it has diminished it  --  and will tend to go on increasing it , progressively . " " How do you figure that out ? " " Through its applications , " Mr. Prop-ter answered . " Applications to warfare , first of all . Better planes , better explosives , better guns and gases  --  every improvement increases the sum of fear and hatred , widens the incidence of nationalistic hysteria . In other words , every improvement in armaments makes it more difficult for people to escape from their egos , more difficult to forget those horrible projections of themselves they call their ideals of patriotism , heroism , glory , and all the rest . And even the less destructive applications of science are n't really much more satisfactory . For what do such applications result in ? The multiplication of possessable objects ; the invention of new instruments of stimulation ; the dissemination of new wants through propaganda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness . But incessant stimulation from without is a source of bondage ; and so the preoccupation with possessions . Andnow you 're threatening to prolong our lives , so that we can go on being stimulated , go on desiring possessions , go on waving flags and hating our enemies and being afraid of air attack  --  go on and on , generation after generation , sinking deeper and deeper into the stinking slough of our personality . " He shook his head . " No , I ca n't quite share your optimism about science . " There was a silence while Pete debated with himself whether to ask Mr. Propter about love . In the end he decided he would n't . Virginia was too sacred . ( But why , why had she turned back at the Grotto ? What could he have said or done to offend her ? ) As much to prevent himself from brooding over these problems as because he wanted to know the old man 's opinions on the last of the three things that seemed to him supremely valuable , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about social justice ? I mean , take the French Revolution . Or Russia . And what about this Spanish business  --  fighting for liberty and democracy against Fascist aggression ? " " Napoleon came out of the French Revolution , " said Mr. Propter after a moment 's silence . " German nationalism came out of Napoleon . The war of 1870 came out of German nationalism . The war of 1914 came out of the war of 1870 . Hitler came out of the war of 1914 . Those arc the bad results of the French Revolution . The good results were the enfranchisement of the French peasants and the spread of political democracy . Put the good results in one scale of your balance and the bad ones in the other , and try which set is the heavier . Then perform the same operation with Russia . Put the abolition of Tzardom and capitalism in one scale ; and in the other put Stalin , put the secret police , put the famines , put twenty years of hardship for a hundred and fifty million people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , put the hordes of slaves in prison camps ; put the military conscription of everybody , male and female , from childhood to old age , put the revolutionary propaganda which spurred the bourgeoisie to invent Fascism . " Mr. Propter shook his head . " Or take the fight for democracy in Spain , " he went on . " There was a fight for democracy all over Europe not so long ago . Rational prognosis can be based only on past experience . Look at the results of 1914 and then ask yourself what chance the Loyalists ever had of establishing a liberal regime at the end of a long war . The others are winning ; so we shall never have the opportunity of seeing what circumstances and their own passions would have driven those well-intentioned liberals to become . " " But , hell ! " Pete broke out , " what do you expect people to do when they 're attacked by the Fascists ? Sit down and let their throats be cut ? " " Of course not , " said Mr. Propter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is based on my previous knowledge of human behavior . But the fact that people generally do react to that kind of situation in that kind of way does n't prove that it 's the best way of reacting . Experience makes me expect that they 'll behave like that . But experience also makes me expect that , if they do behave like that , the results will be disastrous . " " Well , how do you want us to act ? Do you want us to sit still and do nothing ? " " Not nothing , " said Mr. Propter . " Merely something appropriate . " " But what is appropriate ? " " Not war , anyhow . Nor violent revolution . Nor yet politics , to any considerable extent , I should guess . " " Then what ? " " That 's what we 've got to discover . The main lines are clear enough . But there 's still a lot of work to be done on the practical details . " Pete was not listening . His mind had gone back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supremely significant . " But those boys , back there in Spain , " he burst out . " You did n't know them , Mr. Propter . They were wonderful , really they were . Never mean to you , and brave , and loyal and . . . and everything . " He wrestled with the inadequacies of his vocabulary , with the fear of making an exhibition of himself by talking big , like a highbrow . " They were n't living for themselves , I can tell you that , Mr. Propter . " He looked into the old man 's face almost supplicatingly , as though imploring him to believe . " They were living for something much bigger than themselves  --  like what you were talking about just now ; you know , something more than just personal . " " And what about Hitler 's boys ? " Mr. Propter asked . " What about Mussolini 's boys ? What about Stalin 's boys ? Do you suppose they 're not just as brave , just as kind to one another , just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's the cause of justice , truth , freedom , right , and honor ? " He looked at Pete inquiringly ; but Pete said nothing . " The fact that people have a lot of virtues , " Mr. Propter went on , " does n't prove anything about the goodness of their actions . You can have all the virtues  --  that 's to say , all except the two that really matter , understanding and compassion  --  you can have all the others , I say , and be a thoroughly bad man . Indeed , you ca n't be really bad unless you do have most of the virtues . Look at Milton 's Satan for example . Brave , strong , generous , loyal , prudent , temperate , self-sacrificing . And let 's give the dictators the credit that 's due to them ; some of them are nearly as virtuous as Satan . Not quite , I admit , but nearly . That 's why they can achieve so much evil . " His elbows on his knees , Pete sat in silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said at last , " that feeling there was between us . You know  --  the friendship ; only it was more than just ordinary friendship . And the feeling of being there all together  --  fighting for the same thing  --  and the thing being worth while  --  and then the danger , and the rain , and that awful cold at night , and the heat in summer , and being thirsty , and even those lice and the dirt  --  share and share alike in everything , bad or good  --  and knowing that to-morrow it might be your turn , or one of the other boys ' ? your turn for the field hospital ( and the chances were they would n't have enough anaesthetics , except maybe for an amputation or something like that ) or your turn for the burial party . All those feelings , Mr. Propter  --  I just ca n't believe they did n't mean something . " " They meant themselves , " said Mr. Propter . Jeremy saw the opportunity for a counter-attack and , with a promptitude unusual in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same thing apply to your feeling about eternity or whatever it is ? " he asked . " Of course it does , " said Mr. Propter . " Well , in that case , how can you claim any validity for it ? The feeling means itself , and that 's all there is to it . " " It means itself , " Mr. Propter agreed . " But what precisely is this ' itself ' ? In other words , what is the nature of the feeling ? " " Do n't ask me , " said Jeremy with a shake of the head and a comically puzzled lift of the eyebrows . " I really do n't know . " Mr. Propter smiled . " I know you do n't want to know , " he said . " And I wo n't ask you . I 'll just state the facts . The feeling in question is a non-personal experience of timeless peace . Accordingly , non-personality , timelessness , and peace are what it means . Now let 's consider the feelings that Pete has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evoked by temporal situations , and characterized by a sense of excitement . Intensification of the ego within the world of time and craving  --  that 's what these feelings mean . " " But you ca n't call self-sacrifice an intensification of the ego , " said Pete . " I can and I do , " Mr. Propter insisted . " For the good reason that it generally is . Self-sacrifice to any but the highest cause is sacrifice to an ideal , which is simply a projection of the ego . What is commonly called self-sacrifice is the sacrifice of one part of the ego to another part , one set of personal feelings and passions for another set  --  as when the feelings connected with money or sex are sacrificed in order that the ego may have the feelings of superiority , solidarity , and hatred which are associated with patriotism or any kind of political or religious fanaticism . " Pete shook his head . " Sometimes , " he said , with a smile of rueful . perplexity , " sometimes you almost talk like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Propter laughed . " It 's good to be cynical , " he said . " That is , if you know when to stop . Most of the things that we 're all taught to respect and reverence  --  they do n't deserve anything but cynicism . Take your own case . You 've been taught to worship ideals like patriotism , social justice , science , romantic love . You 've been told that such virtues as loyalty , temperance , courage , and prudence are good in themselves , in any circumstances . You 've been assured that self-sacrifice is always splendid and fine feelings invariably good . And it 's all nonsense , all a pack of lies that people have made up in order to justify themselves in continuing to deny God and wallow in their own egotism . Unless you 're steadily and unflaggingly cynical about the solemn twaddle that 's talked by bishops and bankers and professors and politicians and all the rest of them , you 're lost . Utterly lost . Doomed to perpetual imprisonment in your ego  --  doomed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of personalities is this world , the world of greed and fear and hatred , of war and capitalism and dictatorship and slavery . Ycs , you 've got to be cynical , Pete . Specially cynical about all the actions and feelings you 've been taught to suppose were good . Most of them are not good . They 're merely evils which happen to be regarded as creditable . But unfortunately , creditable evil is just as bad as discreditable evil . Scribes and Pharisees are n't any better , in the last analysis , than publicans and sinners . Indeed , they 're often much worse . For several reasons . Being well thought of by others , they think well of themselves ; and nothing so confirms an egotism as thinking well of oneself . In the next place , publicans and sinners arc generally just human animals , without enough energy or self-control to do much harm . Whereas the scribes and Pharisees have all the virtues , except the only two which count , and enough intelligence to understand everything except the real nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over-eat and get drunk . The people who make wars , the people who reduce their fellows to slavery , the people who kill and torture and tell Iies in the name of their sacred causes , the really evil people , in a word  --  these are never the publicans and the sinners . No , they 're the virtuous , respectable men , who have the finest feelings , the best brains , the noblest ideals . " " So what it all boils down to , " Pete concluded in a tone of angry despair , " is that there just is n't anything you can do . Is that it ? " " Yes and no , " said Mr. Propter , in his quiet judicial way . " On a strictly human level , the level of time and craving , I should say that it 's quite true : in the last resort , there is n't anything you can do . " " But that 's just defeatism ! " Pete protested . " Why is it defeatism to be realistic ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see no ' must ' about it . " " Then what about the reformers and all those people ? if you 're right they 're just wasting their time . " " It depends on what they think they 're doing , " said Mr. Propter . " If they think they 're just temporarily palliating particular distresses , if they see themselves as people engaged in laboriously deflecting evil from old channels into new and slightly different channels , then they can justifiably claim to be successful . But if they think they 're making goodappear where evil was before , why then all history clearly shows that they are wasting their time . " " But why ca n't they make good appear where evil was before ? " " Why do we fall when we jump out of a tenth-storey window ? Because the nature of things happens to be such that we do fall . And the nature of things is such that , on the strictly human level of time and craving , you ca n't achieve anything but evil . If you choose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and causes that are characteristic of it , then you 're insane if you expect to transform evil into good . You 're insane , because experience should have shown you that , on that level , there does n't happen to be any good . There are only different degrees and different kinds of evil . " " Then what do you want people to do ? " " Do n't talk as though it were all my fault , " said Mr. Propter . " I did n't invent the universe . " " What ought they to do , then ? " " Well , if they want fresh varieties of evil , let them go on with what they 're doing now . But if they want good , they 'll have to change their tactics . And the encouraging thing , " Mr. Prop-ter added in another tone , " the encouraging thing is that there are tactics which will produce good . We 've seen that there 's nothing to be done on the strictly human level  --  or rather there are millions of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any good . But there is something effective to be done on the levels where good actually exists . So you see , Pete , I 'm not a defeatist . I 'm a strategist . I believe that if a battle is to be fought it had better be fought under conditions in which there 's at least some chance of winning . I believe that if you want the golden fleece it 's more sensible to go to the place where it exists than to rush round performing prodigies of valor in a country where all the fleeces happen to be coal-black . " " Then where ought we to fight for good ? " " Where good is . " " But where is it ? " " On the level below the human and on the level above . On the animal level and on the level . . . well , you can take your choice of names : the level of eternity ; the level , if you do n't object , of God ; the level of the spirit  --  only that happens to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the lower level , good exists as the proper functioning of the organism in accordance with the laws of its own being . On the higher level , it exists in the form of a knowledge of the world without desire or aversion ; it exists as the experience of eternity , as the transcendence of personality , the extension of consciousness beyond the limits imposed by the ego . Strictly human activities are activities that prevent the manifestation of good on the other two levels . For , in so far as we 're human , we 're obsessed with time , we 're passionately concerned with our personalities and with those magnified projections of our personalities which we call our policies , our ideals , our religions . And what are the results ? Being obsessed with time and our egos , we are forever craving and worrying . But nothing impairs the normal functioning of the organism like craving and revulsion , like greed and fear and worry . Directly or indirectly , most of our physical ailments and disabilities are due to worry and craving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart disease , tuberculosis , peptic ulcer , low resistance to infection , neurasthenia , sexual aberrations , insanity , suicide . Not to mention all the rest . " Mr. Propter waved his hand comprehensively . " Craving even prevents us from seeing properly , " he went on . " The harder we try to see , the graver our error of accommodation . In a word , in so far as we 're human beings , we prevent ourselves from realizing the physiological and instinctive good that we 're capable of as animals . And , unactlis tnutandis , the same thing is truein regard to the sphere above . In so far as we 're human beings , we prevent ourselves from realizing the spiritual and timeless good that we 're capable of as potential inhabitants of eternity , as potential enjoyers of the beatific vision . We worry and crave ourselves out of the very possibility of transcending personality and knowing , intellectually at first and then by direct experience , the true nature of the world . " Mr. Propter was silent for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he went on , " most of us do n't manage to behave like human beings all the time . We forget our wretched little egos and those horrible great projections of our egos in the ideal world  --  forget them and relapse for a while into harmless animality . The organism gets a chance to function according to its own laws ; in other words , it gets a chance to realize such good as it 's capable of . That 's why we 're as healthy and sane as we are . Even in great cities as many as four persons out of five manage to go through life without having to be treated in a lunatic asylum . If we were consistently human , the percentage of mental cases would rise from twenty to a hundred . But fortunately most of us are incapable of consistency . The animal is always trying to resume its rights . And to some people fairly frequently , perhaps occasionally to all , there come little flashes of illumination  --  momentary glimpses into the nature of the world as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world as it might be if we did n't choose to deny God by being our personal selves . Those flashes come to us when we 're off our guard ; then craving and worry come rushing back and the light is eclipsed once more by our personality and its lunatic ideals , its criminal policies and plans . " There was silence . The sun had gone . Behind the mountains to the west , a pale yellow light faded through green into a blue that deepened as it climbed .
