Fascinated by roguish Cinemactor Maurice Chevalier , the Women 's Club of Manchester , England , last week invited him to lunch . Godfearing , they counted on the presence of dignified Dean Johnson as toastmaster to make everything all right . But at the last moment the Dean said he " must decline . " Roguish Maurice and the ladies had fearful fun . <P> In Cardiff suspicion arose as to what M. Chevalier means when he winks , rolls his eyes and sings in French . Summoned before Cardiff 's Watch Committee , M. Chevalier 's English manager tried to argue , was sternly ordered to produce a verbatim translation . <P> It was produced , read , debated . Finally the Watch Committee decided that roguish Maurice may not sing in Cardiff . <P> Undaunted , he went on to Brighton . " In Brighton , " proudly declared a civic alderman , " any man can sing anything - well almost anything - in any language he knows . "               @ @ @ @ @ @
