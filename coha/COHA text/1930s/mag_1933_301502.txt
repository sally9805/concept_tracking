Early election morning a swart , chunky little man accompanied by the plain , efficient woman who for eleven years was his secretary and four years ago became his wife , marched into a polling place in Manhattan 's upper East Side . He entered a voting machine , closed the green curtain behind him , pulled down a row of small levers over a row of names headed by his own . Emerging , he refused to smile for photographers . " I 'll do that tonight , " he said . His prediction was correct . By nightfall , Fiorello Henry LaGuardia had become the 101st Mayor of New York City , elected on the first victorious Fusion ticket since 1913 . <P> Never in the history of the city had so many citizens ( 2,100,000 ) voted in a Mayoral election . When he heard that some of his party were not being allowed to vote in his neighborhood , scrappy little Candidate LaGuardia rushed out of his house without an overcoat , stormed into a polling place which was being held by 20 Tammanyites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the first man he saw , barked : " You 're thugs . Get out ! " Another man advanced on him . Major LaGuardia doubled up his fists to do battle . Police restrained him . Candidate LaGuardia promised to kick the interfering officers off the force the day he took office . <P> By the time Mayor-elect LaGuardia climbed happily , theatrically but wearily up to the marquee of the Astor Hotel to show himself to roaring thousands in Times Square , the votes stood : LaGuardia , 858,551 ; Joseph Vincent McKee , onetime acting mayor and Recovery ( independent Democratic ) candidate , 604,045 ; Mayor John Patrick O'Brien , Tammany 's bumbling standard bearer , 586,100 . LaGuardia carried every borough . Fusion won three of the five borough presidencies , the Comptrollership , an overwhelming majority in the Board of Estimate . Recovery candidates , in a surprisingly poor showing got only the Bronx borough presidency . Tammany retained control of the Board of Aldermen , won the Manhattan borough presidency . To the amazement of many an observer , Tammany also won the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an obscure lower court judge . Ferdinand Pecora , the U. S. Senate 's bank inquisitor and the Recovery candidate , ran a poor third . <P> At Foggia , Italy , where Candidate LaGuardia 's father was born and where the Major trained for flying on the Italian front , news of the Fusion victory was pasted on the town hall . Elsewhere in Italy , newspapers exultantly recalled that LaGuardia is " typically Italian , " " a Napoleonic figure . " Italians would have been well within their rights in comparing their hero also to Caruso , so operatic are his posturings , grimacings and emotional up-whoopings on the political platform . Even in private conversation , as with his backer Judge Seabury ( see cut ) , " Napoleon " La-Guardia 's mobile features resemble those of an actor with the plot at its thickest . <P> Mayor-elect LaGuardia &; wife sailed away to rest in Panama , accompanied by his backer , Publisher Frank E. Tichenor of Editor Al Smith 's New Outlook . Before sailing Mr. LaGuardia forswore any part in the movement to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
