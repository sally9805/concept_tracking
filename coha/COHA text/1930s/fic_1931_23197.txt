THE DESTINATION A STORY BY STELLA BENSON M ORRIS thought at first that he was the only passenger in the boat to Bal-dan . He was glad , because he wished to enjoy in solitude his luxurious skill in looking forward  --  a gift that gave this gently misanthropic man the only rapture he knew . Now he was going back to his home from a world that fretted him , and his mind 's eye could so exactly visualize his arrival that it was like memory the wrong way round . With the same immediate excitement as that which attaches itself to certain memories of isolated doings in childhood , he experienced  --  in this region of combined memory and anticipation  --  the joy of a first actual sight of the gnarled old banyan trees on the waterfront and the distant glimpse of the half-naked shabby-gaudy coolies shuffling smoothly along under burdens , from sun to shade and from shade to sun again . " Nothing can prevent it now , " he thought . " My next step on land must be upon the crooked dank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet me , and I shall see his splay feet , one with a missing toe , clamped on to the slimy lower steps , like a snail 's foot . He 'll smile that split smile as he tosses my suitcase on his shoulder , and then he 'll lead the way along the waterfront , under the banyans , till we come to The Turning . " Nothing could prevent him now from seeing that turning again  --  the narrow cobbled alley lined with bright yellow plaster walls , blind except for one rain-streaked sun-faded green door ; the copper-colored bougainvillea would be out now  --  a reticent dark auburn wave of blossom with a green spray of leaves , checked in the act of breaking over the top of the wall . Morris could see every squirming line of the old tree that shaded the well at the end of the alley  --  a tree that his mind labeled as a " strong idiot tree , " of stunted eccentric stature but lateral abundance . It was an evergreen tree ; it took no notice of the seasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very , very green tassels . On the border of the pool of shadow cast by this tree -a dark delicious pool in which the wet stones of the well-head glistened like rocks at low tide  --  Morris 's foreseeing eye saw the Chinese temple gate under square crimped-dolphin-trimmed eaves . This was the smugglers ' temple , and most of the mottoes splashed on vertical boards in golden ideographs dealt with the sea and with sea-dangers . The one nearest the door was as legible to Morris 's mind 's eye as though the actual writing were before his body 's eyes . It implored Kwan-yin , Goddess of Mercy , to " Show a compassion to shipping that should extend even to ferryboats . " Morris 's projected ghost walked in between two stone lions under the temple 's eaves , for across the courtyard of the outer pavilion was the final stone stairway that led to his home . At this point he was obliged to become aware that he had , after all , two fellow-passengers in the boat which was carrying him towards his happiness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were not traveling together ; on the cont ary , each very obviously was repelled by the look of the other . Each separately , therefore , had silently fixed on Morris as a recipient of the inevitable travelers ' commonplaces . It was this unspoken attraction that had really awakened him from his vision . To him neither of his companions seemed very promising ? or rather , one seemed to promise too much and the other too little . The woman was of the superabundant type ; she seemed to Morris to occupy about twenty square feet of deck-space -- not with her body , for it was not stout , but with rich gorgeous scarves , cloak , tassels , hand-bag , and skirt , the blowing of which filled the air about her . The male fellow-passenger , on the other hand , was very ostentatiously enclosed  --  especially against the woman ; he was slyly locked up in a tightly buttoned coat , his collar turned up- his staring eyes slid sidelong glances along the deck towards Morris ? furtive glances designed to avoid the eye of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat slinks from ambush to ambush . It was evident at once that few on board would escape being talked to by the woman-passenger . She walked up and down the deck in her mist of rainbow appendages , humming self-consciously , her eyes seeking the eyes of everyone she met ; even the Chinese sailors , to their surprise , were asked about the weather prospects or congratulated on the deliciousness of the sea air . The buttoned-up man 's spine froze ostentatiously every time she passed behind him , but Morris , though irascible , looked more defenseless ; so very soon the woman 's elbows were on the rail beside his . " Drifting . . . drifting . . . " she said to him in a deep contralto . " A sea voyage suggests itself to one , does n't it , as an allegory of life  --  this drifting through unknown waters to an unknown destination . " " No question of drifting , " said Morris . " This ship is mechanically propelled with reasonable efficiency towards the port of Bal-dan , a destination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighed an unexpectedly natural sigh , and Morris 's heart softened . She said , " I mean , of course , that as far as one is oneself concerned , a voyage , like Life itself , is a drifting . Somewhere behind the mechanism of the ship  --  somewhere behind the mechanism of life  --  there is a Captain , I admit , who knows all destinations perfectly  --  who has all one 's wayward comings and goings under control . " It was Morris 's turn to sigh . He had a prejudice against egoists who dare not use the candid word " I , " but cower behind an ambiguous " one . " Besides , she had interrupted his vision just as his feet were set on the lowest step of the stair that led home . " Nothing can stop me now , " he had thought ; but this woman could stop his eyes from flying forward , as perhaps Mrs. Noah may have jealously tried to check the dove as it took flight from the first homesick exile 's breast . Yet could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew breath to say something more , Morris found his faraway self on the tiny terrace of his house , looking down on the glistening cor rugated green roof of the temple . He stood in the house doorway . The dark blue rug on the dark red-brick floor was striped with low sunlight ; some of these sunlight stripes were dappled with the THE DESTINATION e5 quivering shadows of the leaves of the ginko tree outside . On the table , Joao , Morris 's Eurasian servant , had put a bowl of dark brick-colored nasturtiums . Morris knew that those flowers were there on his table forty miles away , as certainly as he knew that there was a red-sailed junk sowing a furrow of fishing-nets within a few hundred yards of the ship in which his body traveled . " Nothing can stop my seeing those nasturtiums on that table now , " he thought sensuously . " In a few hours I shall put out my hand and touch them . " And he tested his prophetic accuracy , even noticing rapturously that there was a spider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this instant the woman by his side began speaking , and he realized that this last phase of his anticipating memory had been compressed into a second 's time . " One must agree with you , of course , " she said ardently , " that everything is planned . One drifts from horizon to horizon without aim , without compass ; yet some invisible thread draws sympathetic souls together  --  antipathetic souls apart . . . And we have the insolence to call it coincidence . " " 1 really did n't mean to imply alI that , " Morris began , but the implacably sweet expression of the woman 's lips  --  obviously silent only for the shortest possible space politeness allowed for his remark  --  warned him that he must now hear the story of her life . He was right . " One is oneself an example of what one maintains , " she said . " One has reasons for knowing that there is no such thing as coincidence . Coincidence is the silly name one gives to the Deliberate Plans of the Great Plan-maker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word as I , " thought Morris . ) " Can you imagine , " continued his companion intensely , " the position of a feeling , living , throbbing woman , brought up by adored and adoring parents to know the Great Truth that life is not life unless it is all-giving ? all-receiving ? emotionally ? While still a mere child , this woman is tied by law to a mean-hearted old man , whose whole mind is given to the making of money in dusty cities , whose whole idea of giving involves cold , heartless stones diamonds emeralds . . . . Could you apply the mean moral judgment of a puritanic world to such a woman if she should break away from her gilded prison  --  like a butterfly from a cocoon ? to spread her God-given colored wings in the colored free sunshine of life ? " " No , but ? " " Yet , once free , where would you advise such a fragile fugitive to fly to ? " continued the determined autobiographer . " Must she  --  lacking a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself that heart that is so ready to give simply because once its gift was so meanly received ? " Morris trembled and made no reply . He industriously imagined the butterflies among his rambler roses at home . " Nothing can prevent my pruning those roses to-night , after an early supper , " he thought ; and the smell of earth and the dazzle and lilt of butterflies deliciously shocked his prophetic senses . " Everywhere she must go seeking . . seeking . . . a giver seeking for a receiver . And as she wanders over the wide cold world , suddenly coincidence ( so-called ) intervenes  --  in other words , the mystic hint of a Purpose is revealed to her . Imagine her sitting , lonely among crowds , in a hotel in a strange land ; imagine , suddenly , dark Oriental eyes looking into hers , a quiet alien voice drawing her from her reverie , thin brown fingers opening a fairy window of delicate color before her eyes . Only a Chinese pedlar , you might say , trying to sell a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Idly at first , one turned the exquisite pages  --  less and less casually as one went on . . . " Her voice and her acting fingers grew fevered . Morris watched her in uneasy amazement . In a moment every muscle of her body seemed busy with the presentation of her story . " One had a growing feeling that the thread of the story expressed in the pictures drew one on , like the thread spun by the fates . The first picture showed simply a lonely gorgeous figure ? a prince , one supposed , marching bravely alone in a strange land ; in the next there was a new figure dawning  --  a drop of distilled dawn , might one say ? ? far off on a cloud above questioning hills . In all the succeeding pictures this primrose-pale thing  --  a fairy princess blown on a breeze of romance  --  drew closer and closer , closer still while still elusive . . Oh , one ca n't describe this kind of art that says so much more than words . There was meaning in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning as a lost traveler follows a far beacon light . . . . When suddenly  --  a break ? the beacon extinguished  --  the traveler lost once more . The book was only half a book . A jagged emptiness was all that met one 's eyes as one turned the page that showed the fairy princess just about to set foot among the flowers of the human world  --  about to fulfil her destiny and give at last  --  her prince 's awed hands outstretched to receive . The light in one 's imagination was blown out . ' What  --  nothing more ? ' one 's heart cried . ' Only half a book ? ' And saying that , one looked suddenly up into the strange pedlar 's inscrutable eyes , and one knew that the words he was about to utter were a message from  --  well , from the Planner of Coincidences . . . The Master hasthe other half of this book . One half for Lady  --  one half for The Master . ' Where is The Master ? ' one asked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . ' Master say Go to Bal-dan . ' One said nothing . One was speechless . For here was the crux of the coincidence ( if you can still call it coincidence ) . One had already  --  acting on wayward idle impulse  --  booked one 's passage to Bal-dan that very afternoon . And here one is . . . . " She looked at him very intensely . Morris , a naturally good-natured man , though unused to polite society , found it difficult to understand the wave of furious irritation that swept over him . He felt impelled to spoil her story . " My dear madam , you grossly overrate the thing . Master is a perfectly ordinary word from a Chinese of the servant class referring to a superior , when speaking in English . The fellow was simply making an extra dollar or two by selling one book as two . " The woman looked at him with a wide poignant gaze of disappointment . She hesitated for a moment and then said in a low voice , " I beg your pardon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me for my intrusion . " She waited for another moment , beaming upon him bravely , obviously hoping that this frozen listener would thaw into a fountain of understanding words under the penitent warmth of her look . But Morris  --  still angry  --  said nothing , so with a sigh she turned away . Her attention was now necessarily concentrated on the buttoned-up man , and it amused Morris to see how quickly the stranger realized his danger . No sooner had the woman begun again her pacings of the deck  --  parings which brought her at every lap a little nearer to the only Master now available -- than the stranger straightened his back and quite frankly strode to Morris 's side for protection . THE DESTINATION " I 'm scared stiff of that dame , " he said , and Morris realized that he was one of those semi-Levantine wanderers who apparently are not native anywhere but always seem to have visited the United States . " I 'd feel safer in a defensive alliance , I guess . And anyway I wanted to ask you are n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smugglers ' temple in Bal-dan ? " " Yes , " said Morris , and added exultantly  --  and quite unnecessarily , since the ship touched at no other port ? " I 'm on my way home there now . " " I hear you 've got a fine collection of curios there , " continued the stranger . " And I wondered if you 'd care to look at a few liddle things I 've picked up . " Morris was on the point of shouting , " Oh , for God 's sake , everybody , leave me alone ? " when a sudden twinge of rather spiteful curiosity made him say , " What have you got ? Any Chinese books or pictures ? " " Come and see , " said the man happily . On the settee in the ship 's little saloon he opened a suitcase . " Talk about books and pictures , " he said , " here 's a liddle bit of all right . " Sure enough , here it was  --  half a book  --  the latter half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised but rather sickened by what he saw . The primrose-pale fairy had certainly come down to earth in earnest . " Hardly pictures for a lady 's boudwaw , eh ? It 's all the one story , you see  --  about some kind of historical dame , I understand ; but she knew a thing or two outside history , I 'll tell the world . Looky here at this one , and this one . .. . Well , well , it 's love that makes the world go round , they say . . . . The Chink that sold me that said he 'd divided the book into two , so he could sell one half to a missisy and the other half to a master  --  ha-ha-ha . I 'll let you have it dirt cheap , for admit it 's not everybody 's choice . You could just take it out of the safe when you felt lonesome or blue -- eh ? No ? Aw well  --  how about this little piece of ivory  --  no dooble-ontong about that anyway  --  or this swell little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 9/ Morris , who had for a moment contemplated buying a little present for his house , as a returning husband might buy a ring for his wife , felt suddenly tired of the man and , refusing everything , returned to the deck . He was none too soon . Already the darling skyline of Bal-dan was in sight . His outer eyes new instantly to the green dome of the old tree above the temple ; temple , well , alley , bungalow , terrace  --  all were still invisible , but Morris 's inner eyes saw Joao squatting on the terrace , fanning himself as he watched the horizon ; his mind 's sharp hearing registered the shout of joy that Joao gave as the ship was identified . " He 's coming  --  he 's coming . . . . " " And nothing on earth can stop my coming now , " thought Morris , reassuring the far-away Joao . " I knew it would be just like this . All this has not been merely on its way to me  --  it 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die . " He felt so happy that he even left that distant tree unwatched for a moment , and turned to the woman fellow-passenger , who stood rather forlornly near him . Suddenly eloquent with happiness he said , " I 'm afraid I was abrupt just now ; you were talking of coincidence , and especially of that coincidence that gave you a feeling of being led to Bal-dan . Do n't expect too much of coincidences ; you see , coincidences are really just as remarkable if they just do n't come off as if they just do . A miss by a hairbreadth is not as good as a mile at all  --  it 's as extraordinary as a hit by a hairbreadth . If there is a god of coincidences , he has it both ways . Coincidences are poor paths anyway  --  whether you follow them with a Mystic Purpose or stumble on them by mistake It 's much safer to make a thing yourself , and know it absolutely perfectly  --  to know its past and , above all , its future  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain again and again till you die . Leaving a destination to chance  --  to God  --  to coincidence  --  is too dangerous ; there might be nothing at the end ? nothing but a blank or a ruin . You must be able to look forward as surely as you can look back . " To his utter amazement , the woman interrupted him with a high and piercing scream . At the same instant the whole ship was most oddly agitated ; acreaking of all her parts filled the air , exactly like the creaking of an immense rocking-horse . Morris looked across the sea at Bal-dan and saw the old stone wharf suddenly hump itself like a caterpillar ; he saw the front of the hotel fall into the harbor and two trees swoon into each other 's arms . Then everything , from waterline to skyline , was swallowed up in black dust ; dust was built in three impenetrable and fearful domes between sea and sky . A flame awoke like an opening window , near the base of this appalling edifice . The rising roar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the blackness across the sea .
