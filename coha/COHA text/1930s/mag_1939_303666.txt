WAR &; PEACE <P> For more than twelve years ( since May 21 , 1927 ) Colonel Charles Augustus Lindbergh has been a U. S. hero . He has been called " super-hero , " " the perfection of man , " " the Columbus of the Air , " the " perfect gentle knight . " <P> Last week to many a U. S. citizen he was a bum. * To a pack of U. S. newspaper pundits , he was worse than that : they thought they saw in his second Isolationist speech ( TIME , Oct. 23 ) the spoor of a Nazi fox . Dorothy Thompson and Walter Lippmann read dread things between the nave Lindbergh lines . Heywood Broun thought the speech " one of the most militaristic " ever made by an American . To Columnist Hugh S. Johnson he was " Poor Lindy " who had " stepped from his hero 's niche . " <P> Columnist Eleanor Roosevelt joined the hunt , noted : " She Dorothy Thompson sensed in Col. Lindbergh 's speech a sympathy with Nazi ideals which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really there . " ( Snapped Hugh Johnson next day at Mrs. Roosevelt : " That is exactly the kind of stuff that got us into the war in 1917 . " ) Plainer people began to sound off . Ex-Heavyweight Champion Gene Tunney called Lindbergh 's speech " impertinence . " Michigan 's Senator Prentiss Brown called it imperialistic . A Reserve Officer chaplain in Seattle spoke of " Herr von Lindbergh . " Sculptor Suzanne Silvercruys of New York City told Canadians she was glad her memorial commemorating Lindbergh 's Paris flight had been broken in shipment . The Communist weekly , New Masses , said the speech revealed the " intricate conspiracies of the House of Morgan . " ( Anne Lindbergh is the daughter of the late Dwight Morrow , Morgan partner . ) <P> From England , where denunciation had been loudest , now came a " defense " more destructive than any attack so far . Wrote Author Harold Nicolson , in whose " Long Barn " estate at the foot of the Kentish weald Lindbergh stayed during his English exile : " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son ) with a loathing for publicity that was almost pathological . He identified the outrage to his private life first with the popular press and then . . . with freedom of speech and then , almost , with freedom . He began to loathe democracy , . . . His self-confidence thickened into arrogance and his convictions hardened into granite . . . . His mind had been sharpened by fame and tragedy until it had become as hard as metal and as narrow as a chisel . " <P> Tracing Lindbergh 's admiration of the German air force , his alarm over British unpreparedness , Nicolson said : " He liked their grim efficiency and liked the mechanization of the State and he was not at all deterred by the suppression of free thought and free discussion . . . . The slow , organic will power of Britain eluded his observation . . . . He is and always will be not merely a schoolboy hero but also a schoolboy . " <P> Colonel Lindbergh held his peace , and his chums hoped he would continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a lonely goat had crossed the trail-without diverting the attention of the pundit pack .
