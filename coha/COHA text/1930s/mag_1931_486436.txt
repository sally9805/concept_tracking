THERE is a school of economists which holds that all business cycles are caused by changes in the price level  --  that it is rising prices which bring prosperity and falling prices which bring depression . If these economists are right , and if the business cycle is the unmitigated evil that most of them regal d it as being , then the task to which all economists and statesmen ought to address themselves is that of keeping prices stable . To keep prices constantly rising would be as undesirable as it would be impossible . Such a plan would keep industry humming and profits soaring , but those profits would be mainly at the expense of labor , whose wages would rise more slowly than wholesale prices , and also at the expense of the creditor class . ( There is a popular misconception of this term which leads to a great deal of confused thought . When it is said that inflation helps the " debtor class " at the expense of the " creditor class , " many persons assume that this is equivalent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rich . But " creditors " include all savings-bank depositors , holders of life-insurance policies , and so on , and " debtors " include all the great corporations with bond issues outstanding . The great stockholder is usually , in this sense , a great " debtor , " and as such , stands to gain from inflation . ) The history of Germany in the six years following the war is a sufficient example of the effects of the constantly rising price level . The effect of a falling price level is , of course , much worse . By reducing or wiping out profits , it compels manufacturers to reduce output or shut down entirely and throw men out of work . When the general price decline is relatively small , and is accompanied by increasing industrial efficiency , it may benefit both the laborer and the creditor , as did the decline from 1925 to 1929 , for example . But when the fall becomes violent , as it has in the last two years , a large part of the creditor class also suffers heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these evils could be done away with , in the opinion of many economists , if commodity prices could be kept at a single unvarying average level . The method most frequently suggested for achieving this is through some change , manipulation , or " management " of money . The schemes of this nature are innumerable , and in recent months magazine editors have been flooded with them . Most of them inescapably suggest the ingenious inventions with which the cartoonist Goldberg used to beguile us , in which , the object being , say , to kill potato bugs , Mr. Goldberg would design a marvelously intricate series of levers , pulleys , fallingweights , water-spouts , caged squirrels , and so on , and proceed to show how , through a process of causation partly mechanical and partly psychological , either a hammer would finally land on the bug , or it would die of fright . Apart from the more fantastic of these currency schemes , or outright inflationary projects which involve the manufacture of various forms of fiat money , those that have succeeded in commanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) bimetallism ; ( 2 ) plans for stabilizing prices through control of bank rates and volume of credit ; and ( 3 ) plans for controlling prices by varying the amount of gold in the dollar . Bimetallism need not detain us long . Most of the present propaganda for it comes directly from the silver interests or from Senators from the silver-producing States .. That it would raise the price of silver  --  particularly if the absurd legal ratio to gold that is usually proposed were actually accepted  --  is certain . Its other benefits are not clear . A bimetallic standard tends in practice to become an alternating single standard , depending upon the relative market values of gold and silver as compared with their legal-ratio values . If the silver interests could get silver overvalued in the ratio as compared with gold  --  which is , of course , their whole aim  --  then gold would be driven out of currency or reserve use by the operation of " Gresham 's law " ; and if silver were sufficiently overvalued in the ratio , we might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We should also , in that event , find . ourselves on a higher price level as a result of the debasement of the standard ; but this end , if it were desirable , could be achieved in a more direct , dependable , and much less costly fashion by reducing the gold content of the present gold dollar . It is much more frequently suggested that the price level could be stabilized through control of central bank rates and the volume of credit . Maynard Keynes 's recent " managed-currency " proposals in the main suggest these means . There is of course an intimate relationship between bank rates , volume of credit , and price levels ; but there is by no means a simple or a directly proportional relationship . It is possible for those in control of central banks to reduce the volume of credit by raising discount rates high enough , though it is impossible for them to know beforehand just how much effect a given advance in the discount rate will have on the volume of credit . And even this measure of control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depression the discount rate may be lowered to next to nothing without increasing the volume of credit , as the recent experience of the Federal Reserve banks amply testifies . Finally , even if the bank rate could directly control the volume of credit , or if other means could be found , there is no direct proportional relationship between the volume of credit and the general price level . The cause-effect relation , moreover , is practically the reverse of what these credit-volume proposals assume . It is not the volume of credit which determines the general price level , but the price level which , together with the activity of business and speculation , determines the volume of credit . Of all the plans for stabilizing the price level , that of the " compensated dollar , " of which Irving Fisher has been the leading exponent , has the advantage of being the most direct . If we disregard for the moment its secondary effects , there can be little doubt that it would achieve what it directly set out to achieve . That plan , in essence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present gold standard based on a dollar of a " fixed weight and fineness of gold , " and substitute for it a paper dollar , still redeemable on demand in gold , but redeemable in a varying quantity of gold , depending on the course of commodity prices . As prices rose , the weight of the dollar would be increased to pull them down ; as they fell , the weight of the dollar would be lightened to push them up again . The changes in the gold content of the dollar would be based on an index number of commodity prices , and would be announced , say , once a month . It can be said in favor of this plan that as long as it could be kept in operation it would actually prevent all but negligible changes in the general price level . But the drawbacks would greatly outweigh the possible advantage of the plan , particularly if any one country attempted to apply it acting alone . If the values of other commodities as compared with gold soared to more than twice their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to pay out more than twice as much gold in redemption of notes as otherwise . Only a very strong country would be able to command this increased supply of gold . If prices fell precipitously in a crisis , foreign bankers and speculators , anticipating a reduced amount of gold for their credits in that country , would drain gold out of the Country at such a rate that it would soon be compelled to abandon gold redeemability altogether . Some of the greatest difficulties and dangers of the plan could be avoided if it were adopted not by one country acting alone but by international agreement among all the leading gold-basis countries of the world . Such international agreement would , however , be enormously difficult to obtain ; and it would face the initial difficulty that a single index number of world prices would- not correctly represent the movement of prices in any one country , while different index numbers for different countries would complicate the foreign-exchange problems worse than ever . Even a world-wide adoption of the plan , moreover , would not prevent speculators everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , against governments  --  turning in gold for currency when they anticipated a rise in commodity prices and currency for gold when they anticipated a fall . We are compelled , in brief , to dismiss as impracticable all existing plans for stabilizing prices directly by the manipulation of gold , silver , currency , or credit . There is a further objection to these plans besides their immediate impracticability . Substantially every one of them rests on the false assumption that all depressions are caused by changes in the general price level . They fail to consider the causes that have led to the fall of prices itself . Doubtless many long-run price movements  --  that is , tendencies extending over more than a decade  --  are the result of changes in the supply of gold itself ; but most price changes  --  and this applies particularly to those of the last few years  --  are the result of changes in the supply ofand demand for goods . Moreover , an attempt to deal with all crises simply by the manipulation of currency or credit would be not unlike the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spine : it may not only be harmful in itself , but by ignoring the real causes of the trouble it allows those causes to continue to operate . Nor , again , is it desirable under all conditions to keep the average level of commodity prices " pegged " at any one point . If new inventions , new chemical processes , or more efficient industrial methods make certain basic commodities or widely used articles cheaper to produce , the public should have the advantage of that cheapness directly . It should not , because of any fetish made out of the stability of the general average of prices , be compelled to pay more for other commodities , as it would be if the " compensated-dollar " plan were put into effect . This consideration brings up immediately the real problem that we face today . It is not the change in the general level of prices that causes industrial deadlock and stagnation ; it is changes in the relations of particular prices , or of particular classes of prices . The violent fall in the prices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall in prices of finished goads , or in indebtedness , interest , wages , rents , and other production costs , brought about a situation in which raw-material producers as a whole , and the labor dependent on them , were no longer able to buy finished goods ; so that the relatively high price of the finished goods brought little advantage to those who had them to sell . This situation still exists . We can epitomize one angle of it by comparing the decline in Bradstreet 's index number of wholesale commodity prices between December 1 , 1929 , and December , l , this year , which amounted to more than 35 per cent , with the decline in the " cost of living , " as shown by the figures of the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics , which amounted between December 1 , 1929 , and June 1 of this year to only 12 per cent . The situation in which this decline and deadlock have left us is illustrated in one of its aspects most forcibly by the railroads . Traffic has declined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue their former dividends on their stock , where a very large number are not earning their bond interest , and where a substantial number are not even earning their operating expenses . Under these circumstances the railroad executives contend that the roads can not be saved unless railway labor takes a 10 per cent cut in wages . The executives point out that as the cost of living , as shown by the Labor Bureau 's figures , declined 12 per cent between December , 1929 , and June , 1931 , and will doubtless show a further decline when the December figure is published , such a reduction would still leave railway labor better off than it was at the peak of prosperity . Railway labor , however , can hardly be blamed if it does not immediately see the justice of this proposal . No doubt , if a wage that varied with the cost of living were generally in effect in industry at the present time , it would make the transition to a new price level enormously smoother , less wasteful , and less painful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistance for its increases , would be justifiably suspicious of enthusiasm for such a wage system among employers at the present time , when the prospect is almost certainly for a further decline in living costs . Moreover , it is not easy for the worker to look upon his wages as the purchasing power for a certain standard of living ; he looks upon them directly , as dollars , as if they had a fixed value in themselves . Forty-five dollars a week is forty-five dollars a week , whether it purchases more or less . It is wages based on a cost-of-living index number that would seem to him uncertain and fluctuating . Nor is this view entirely unreasonable . Such a wage might vary from month to month , whereas a fixed item of expense , like the worker 's rent , for example , might vary only from year to year . Further , a cost-of-living index which reflected average changes for the entire country might not correctly reflect them for the particular city in which the worker lived . The average cost of living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased 50.3 per cent between 1913 and June , 1931 , but the increase in New York City was 57.1 per cent . The possible discrepancies become more striking if we take a single item , like rent . In Los Angeles , rents in December , 1923 , had increased 100.9 per cent over those in December , 1914 ; from that point they broke violently , and in June of this year were only 31.3 per cent above those of 1914 . But rents in New York , which in December , 1923 , had increased only 62.4 per cent above those of 1914 , were still 61.5 per cent above in June of this year . A still further reason why the cost-of-living argument is not likely to appeal to the worker asked to ' take a cut in wages is that the same medicine has not been suggested for the bondholder . When railway labor was recently asked by the executives to accept a voluntary reduction , the union leaders remarked that they saw no reason why the worker should be asked to turn 10 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , is not quite just as applied to the bondholder who has held his securities since 1914 , for he is still receiving no more in dollars than he was then , whereas train- and engine-service labor on Class I railroads has been receiving about double what it did in 1914 . But the argument is certainly relevant against the bondholder who got his bonds within the last decade . He stands to gain from the decline in prices , while the railroad worker is being asked to " protect " him . Regardless of considerations of " justice , " the purely economic argument against the fixed bond is a very powerful one . The burden of fixed debts upon nations , industries , homes , and farms offers perhaps the greatest single problem presented by the present crisis . If Congress were to pass an act declaring that the interest and principal of bonds and mortgages were to be scaled down in the same ratio as commodity prices since 1929 , the act would be denounced everywhere as an attack upon the rights of property and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemned by the Supreme Court as unconstitutional . The way we are actually taking and will probably continue to take will be that of , default , receivership , wrangling among different classes of creditors , and endless litigation . Perhaps industry will learn in future to issue fewer bonds , to substitute either preferred stocks or at least debenture bonds on which interest does not have to be paid unless it is earned . Perhaps we may even be able to develop a " compensated " bond to take care of changes in price levels . The problem is an enormously difficult and complex one ; but if no obvious answer presents itself , it is no longer possible to ignore it or to treat it as if it were merely academic . Capitalism must learn either how to stabilize itself or how to adjust itself ; its price structure must become either firm or genuinely flexible . If it can not provide a smooth road , it must at least provide reasonably satisfactory shock absorbers . Only by more drastic reforms than it has hitherto been willing to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
