In from the troubled Atlantic one afternoon sped a blue-check homing pigeon . Down over the New Jersey strand it wheeled , dropped to rest in a loft in Manasquan . From a capsule attached to its leg a burnished , businesslike youth extracted a penciled message , scanned it , then hustled to his telephone . In no time the U. S. Coast Guard launch ' Squan Beach was scuffing its way through the breakers for a point " two and a half hours ' run southeast of Manasquan Inlet . " In considerably less than two and a half hours , the 30-foot fishing boat Ridgewise , 15 miles offshore with a party of eight and a conked motor , was securely in tow . <P> In the last two Jersey shore fishing seasons ( May through October ) , 17-year-old Pigeon Tycoon Joel Parker Jr . has turned a pretty penny . The squat Jersey stink-pots that take thousands of anglers to the offshore fishing grounds are not apt to be equipped with radios . But every skipper in the fleet has known times when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Four years ago the Florida deep-sea fleet began carrying homing pigeons . Primarily the birds were for emergency , but many a pigeon flew back to Miami Beach with the time-worn query : " How 's fishin ' ? " <P> Not far behind Florida was Manasquan 's Joel Parker . Last year he began to work the pigeons he had been raising as a hobby , charged 50 a bird a day . This season Joel has been renting between 15 and 35 of his 75 birds every day , furnishing coops , capsules and message paper , has thus far had ten 50 S O Ss . Best businessman in last June 's graduating class at Manasquan High School , he now expects his flock to put him through West Virginia Business College in Bluefield , W. Va. , where he goes as a freshman this month . His father will run the business in his absence . Like most private corporations , Joel Parker keeps his balance sheet to himself , but best-informed guesses set his operating gross to date at well over $2,000.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
