txt A dash of blazing speed so bewildered a White Elephant today that no end of consternation and turmoil and even a deal of confusion prevailed among 37,000 nerve-racking baseball enthusiasts in the playing of the second game of the 1931 world 's series . Part of the speed emanated from the whip-like left arm of one William Hallahan , a Binghamton boy who grew up to be known as Wild Bill of the Great Southwest , because no one could ever forecast in which direction of the Great Southwest he would throw a baseball once he wound up on the pitcher 's mound . Today he duplicated what he did a year ago . He shut out the mighty Athletics and he allowed them only three hits . The rest of the speed was supplied by Johnny Martin , called " Pepper " for reasons that became clear at once when it is told that it was chiefly , if not entirely , his great fleetness of foot that provided the Cardinals with the necessary wherewithal to score an astounding victory over the seemingly invincible Connie Meek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Martin the alert Who , in the second inning , stretched a single into a double when the usually careful Al Simmons failed to field Johnny 's line hit as accurately as is his custom . It was Martin who , a moment later , stole third base right under the nose of Mickey Cochrane , generally acclaimed as baseball 's greatest catcher , and it was Martin who then brought home the first tally of the game on a long fly by Jimmy Wilson . Martin Whirls Over Plate . Five innings later , at a time when Hallahan was struggling manfully to hold his one-run advantage over the formidable George Earnshaw , the right bower of Connie Mack 's twoman pitching staff , Martin unleashed another amazing burst of speed . He singled , stole second , dashed on to third on an infield out and fairly whirled over the plate on a squeeze-play bunt laid down by his colleague , Charlie Gelbert . Those two tallies threw the crowd , which numbered in paid attendance 35,947 and provided $157,415 in receipts , into a deafening uproar that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For this victory enabled the Cardinals to draw abreast in the series with the Mackmen at one game apiece , and not once since 1926 have the standard bearers of the National League , been able to advance upon the third game of the classic on even - terms with the American League champions . Unlike yesterday 's opening clash , today 's conflict was an intensely dramatic struggle , and never more so than at the very end when for a few riotous moments there threatened the spectacle of a world 's series game winding up in utter confusion . Vast Throng Tense and Hopeful . First you must picture this great crowd of Missourians , sitting with bated breath , is the battle moved into the ninth and fervently praying that their young man , Hallahan , would not go the way of all flesh and collapse with victory over the dreaded Mackmen in his grasp . Up to this throbbing moment he had performed a great job in outhurling Earnshaw , the hero of the 1930 series , and he now needed to collect only three more outs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Wild Bill days of the great Southwest and walked Jimmy Foxx . He retired Bing Miller on a soaring fly to Chick Hafey in left , but he walked Jimmy Dykes and the fans squirmed uneasily in the stands . . They remembered what these same Mackmen had done to Pat Malone in a similar situation in 1929 , and they recalled even more painfully what had happened to their own Burleigh Grimes in the pivotal fifth game last year . There was an awesome silence in the arena . Came Dibrell Williams , the only new cog in the Mack machine in the last three years of triumph , as the next batter , but young Dibrell struck out and the audience breathed again . Connie Mack , the master strategist , now prepared for his last move and sent Jimmy Moore to pinch hit for Earnshaw . Hallahan rang up two strikes on Jimmy and one ball . Moore then foul-tipped the next one , but Catcher Wilson failed to hold the ball in his mitt and the suspense continued . Moore Fans and Uproar Starts . Hallahan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moore swung and missed and Wilson hurled the ball to Flowers , the Cardinals third baseman . What followed will doubtless ever remain as fervid a topic of discussion among baseball men as the famous long count of the TunneyDempsey bout has been among followers of boxing . Hallahan 's pitch , it appears , had struck the ground behind the plate just before Wilson caught it , and therefore technically made it necessary for the catcher to retire the batter at first base or one of the other base runners . But no one in the arena seemed aware of this except Eddie Collins , veteran of many a world 's series combat , and now Connie Mack 's first lieutenant and third base coach . While spectators were rushing out on the field Collins frantically shouted to Moore to run to first base and rushed up to Umpire Nallin , the plate umpire , calling that official 's attention to the oversight committed by Wilson in throwing to third base , where Flowers had no time to tag the onsliding Foxx , when he should have fired the ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made . No end of bewilderment followed . The entire Cardinal bench , headed by Gabby Street , emptied itself on the playing field and advanced in a solid phalanx upon the umpire . Couriers from the Mack bench rushed hither and yon , while the field police roared at the storming populace to get off the grass and stay off . Collins 's Version Upheld . In time order was restored and the taapires agreed that the shrewd Collins 's swift version of the situation had been correct . The Mackmen now had the bases filled and Hallahan , who to all intents and purposes had twice struck out what he believed to be the last batter , was still confronted with the task of collecting a third out . Fortunately , that elusive out was not long in coming , and when it came it gave the day a final dramatic touch . Max Bishop , after taking a bail . hoisted a high foul in front of the field boxes far down the right field side of the grandstand . Bottomley , the Cards ' first baseman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last world 's series and he had also done nothing exceptionally commendable today in the way of providing hits , but he meant to catch that ball if it cost . a coupler-of cracked ribs and two broken lee , Burled Under- Spectatoii . Into the boxes crashed Bottomley as , with extended gloved hand , he clutched the sphere . That he caught it at all was made known only by the first base umpire , Dolly Stark , for Sunny Jim himself had passed from view under a mass of spectators . And so ended one of baseball 's most torrid world 's series battles , for both the crowd and the Cardinals were desperate for a victory . The proud Mackmen had entered the series top-heavy favorites to annex their third successive world 's series triumph and they had thrashed the Cards quite thoroughly in the opening game yesterday . It therefore can easily be understood why pandemonium still prevails at a late hour tonight on both banks of the Mississippi . Earnshaw , in attempting to duplicate his great work of last year , pitched an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the three made off his left-handed opponent . But in the main Earnshaw appeared to have hurled an even steadier encounter than his rival , for he passed only one batter , whereas Hallahan walked seven and repeatedly had his back to the wall In the closing rounds because of these lapses of control . Earnshaw Caught Off Guard . But Martin 's amazing speed on the bases led to Earnshaw 's undoing , When Johnny stretched his hit into a double in the second inning Earnshaw may have allowed himself to become slightly careless for he should have known that to move on is an inherent trait of the exuberant Cardinal outfielder . So , stealing third was nothing unusual for Johnny Martin , but it cost Earnshaw a run , for Wilson followed with a long fly and Johnny scored . In the seventh Martin ran'rampant again and it cost Earnshaw another tally . At all other stages the Mack ace had matters thoroughly under control , even if George Watkins stung him for a double in the first inning and Frankie Frisch , the erstwhile Fordham flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innings Hallahan moved along majestically and triumphantly with seemingly not a care in the world . In that interval not a Mackman had hit him safely and only one reached first base , Cochrane drawing a pass in the fourth . But in the fifth trouble began creeping up on Wild Bill of the great Southwest . He walked Foxx and Miller prodded him for a single for the first Mack hit of the day , Dykes sacrificed the runners on to second and third , after which Hallahan passed Williams to fill the bases . It was , however , not a bad move for Earnshaw thumped the ball into a double play , snappily executed by Frisch , Gelbert and Bottomley . Watkins Snares Cochrane 's Drive . Came a single by Haas in the sixth with one out and the doughty Mickey Cochrane swung heavily on the ball to sail it on a line toward right centre . But Watkins sped across the turf on the wings of the wind for a fine catch and so this Mack threat wound up in a blind alley . More of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a single , the third and what was to be the last Mackian drive of the day . Miller forced Foxx and Dykes fouled out to Bottomley , but Halleban walked Williams , unfurled a wild pitch and Miller was now dusting himself off at third . However , Hallahan had only Earnshaw to dispose of and this time he struck his hurling aversary out . The eighth passed quietly enough for Hallahan . He did walk Cochrane in this round after retiring the first two batters , but Simmons 's best on this occasion was a soaring infield fly that Gelbert caught just in back of second base . The round , however , proved only a calm before a storm that engulfed the entire struggle in the ninth and that doubtless will remain an event to be told and re-told down the ages , much in the manner of the famous Snodgrass muff and the epic chase of Eddie Collins over the plate by Heine Zimmerman . Scene Shifts to Philadelphia . Tonight the vanguard of the world 's series carnival moved on to Philadelphia , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tuesday and Wednesday . All St. Louis , however , is confident that it will see more of this series , for the Athletics , to prevent the conflict from returning here next Friday for the sixth game , must capture all three of the games in Philadelphia . Of the belligerents directly involved in the struggle , only the Athletics left for Philadelphia tonight . They entrained at 6 o'clock and will arrive in their home city early tomorrow . The Cardinals . however , preferred to remain here overnight as no game is to be played Sunday , and therefore they will not leave for Philadelphia until tomorrow . Aside from the native St. Louisans , probably the happiest folk in all the world tonight are the National Leaguers who , headed by President John Heydler , see visions of a return of the old order when the Cubs , Pirates and Giants brought victory to the senior major league circuit in these annual struggles for world baseball supremacy .
