Always on display in the art gallery in Manhattan 's Grand Central Station is a selection of fauns , nymphs , Indians and babies holding fish , designed by orthodox sculptors . Another statue went on view there last week . It was a white Carrara marble figure of a nude young woman , seated and gazing reflectively at her left foot . In front of the figure was a black marble reflecting pool , behind it cedar trees and potted plants . Called Reverie , it attracted great attention not only because it was pleasant to the eye but also because its creator , a grandmother , is the wife of Albert Henry Wiggin whose bank ( Chase ) vies with National City for title of " world 's biggest . " <P> Only two years ago did Mrs. Jessie Duncan Hayden Wiggin feel that she had time to spare to sculpt . Telling few of her friends , she rented a studio in MacDougal Alley behind the Whitney Museum and began to study under Victor Salvatore . She worked hard . Reverie is her first work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Greenwich , Conn . <P> " I really feel that sculpture is my profession , " said pleasant Grandmother Wiggin . " It has given me quite a thrill to have really created something . " - Hearst 's San Francisco Examiner ( " Monarch of the Dailies " ) last week took notice of that city 's cultural life by reporting the completion of a fresco by youthful Artist Victor Arnautoff , onetime pupil of Diego Rivera . On the wall of his studio near the edge of the Telegraph Hill art colony Artist Arnautoff , a sociable fellow , had painted the likenesses of 23 of his friends grouped about the seated figure of a nude female model . The Examiner printed with its story a four-column picture of the fresco . To the great astonishment of Artist Arnautoff and the model , it showed the latter clad in a hand-painted bathing suit .
