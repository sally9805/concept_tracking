When Media Records , which measures newspaper advertising , last week released its November figures for New York City , the Herald Tribune had piled up a nice Sunday gain on its competitor , the Times . Compared with November 1936 , the Times lost an average of five pages of advertising each Sunday while the Herald Tribune made a fractional gain . Ordinarily such a record calls for prolonged professional crowing , but the Herald Tribune has been in no mood to crow since Sunday , November 21 , when the paper carried as " Section XII " a 40-page glorification of Cuban Boss Fulgencio Batista 's illiberal regime . <P> Section XII brought the Herald Tribune $32,000 from the Cuban Government and business interests . The U. S. Postal regulations require that when material of this type-is carried second class , it must be labeled Advertisement . This regulation caused the Tribune its first headache , since the section was merely announced as " written and presented by friends of Cuba . " From the Post Office the Tribune got a warning , replied with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack that a U. S. newspaper has had to stand for since a Hearst photographer dangerously crowded Col. Charles Lindbergh 's car to the curb on a hairpin curve three years ago , snapped a picture of Baby Jon . <P> The liberal press was , of course , warmest in its condemnation of Section XII . Said the Nation : " The Herald Tribune has got away with the publication of paid propaganda at a nice profit . The money that swelled its advertising revenue came out of the hide of an oppressed nation ... " To which New Republic added : " It is a portrait which everyone informed about the situation in Cuba knows to be fantastically remote from the truth . " The advertising director of the New York Times , in a confidential memorandum to his staff , which was picked up and reprinted by the Guild Reporter , recognized the moral obloquy involved in Section XII , also reported that publishers " protesting against the section are doing so on the principle . . . that paid-for news propaganda must not be included as legitimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even the conservative Editor &; Publisher warned that " the whole enterprise comes perilously close to the ethical line . . . . Commercial announcements , no matter what their object and no matter how pleasingly prepared , have no right to trespass on the space and the garb in which the public expects newspapers to print their own views and the authentic reports of responsible correspondents .
