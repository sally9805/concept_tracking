Bermuda , land of honeymoons , the 20 sq . mi. islands where yellow Brooks sweaters and turquoise tweed skirts once blossomed like wildflowers , where daiquiris trickled like forest streams , is different these days . It is just another British colony at war . <P> A week before war broke out , the change was already noticeable . The population ( 30,552 ) began trenching the talcum-powder beaches , the little green coves . Reserves of the Bermuda Volunteers were feverishly called up . Bermuda 's familiar bicycles were mounted by furiously pedaling couriers in uniform . Letters both incoming and outgoing were rigidly censored ( not yet done in Canada ) . Even women got busy on counterespionage . An innocent German hairdresser who has been on the island for 15 years was eyed with deep suspicion . <P> The island 's small oil docks and ammunition dumps were clapped under guard . Veterans of World War I were given guard detail until one fell asleep at his post ( oil dock ) while smoking a cigaret , which dropped and caused a big grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sentry beats to nearby bars : the orderly officer , making his rounds one evening , found the ammunition dump completely deserted and reproachfully wrote his name all over the walls before the sentries reappeared . <P> Sir Reginald John Thoroton Hildyard , K.C.B. , C.M.G. , D.S.O. , who resigned his post as Governor General last April because the Colonial Assembly refused to let him have an automobile ( only garbage and soldiers were allowed trucks ) must have been piqued to hear that cars were now permitted all over the islands . Fire engines and ambulances filled with war workers screeched through Hamilton ; the Army rumbled around in " trolleys " - large trucks formerly used for carrying convicts to work ; manager of the Mid-Ocean Club , who owned a car for use within the Club 's 200-acre estate , dashed happily back &; forth with dispatches between St. George and Hamilton , the capital . With the island under decree law , women suffragists revived their old agitation for the ballot and were pleased and surprised when one of Governor General Denis Kirwan Bernard 's first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the war , but they were sadder to lose their good , gold-laden friends , the American tourists . Instead of arriving at an average rate of 5,000 per month , tourists scurried away from the Isles of Rest . On the Furness Monarch of Bermuda 's , last trip-the ship was painted gloomy grey-she was loaded to the jack-stays with tourists hurrying home . Last week Bermudians were momentarily bucked to hear that the Holland-American luxury liner Nieuw Amsterdam ( capacity 1,000 ) had taken over the suspended Furness , Withy &; Co. contract , and was sailing from Manhattan . They were let down again when they heard that the passenger list numbered 139 , mostly natives returning to the storm-vexed , war-vexed Bermoothes.
