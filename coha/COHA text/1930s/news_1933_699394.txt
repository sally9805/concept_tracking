txt Pleased to Be Taxed . To the Editor of The New York Times : In your editorial " Realization " you state , quoting Edmund Burke : . " To tax to please " can not be done . Do n't you think practically all of the consumers of bootleg whisky would be tickled to death to pay an excise tax of $2.20 a gallon on good bonded whisky if they could buy it for $1.50 a quart ? That is the price it could be sold at and still pay a reasonable profit to producer and distributer . Together with the revenue from beer and wine and reasonable reduction in Federal expenses , this tax should balance the budget and eliminate the consideration of a sales tax which would only retard recovery . To gain this end all that would be necessary would be to refuse appropriations for enforcement . WM . COMERFORD , Buffalo , N. Y. , Jan. 3 , 1933.
