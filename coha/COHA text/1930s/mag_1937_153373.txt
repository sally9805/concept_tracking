Second only to William Randolph Hearst for his personal scoop of King Edward 's determination to marry the Woman of the Year ( TIME , Nov. 2 ) , in the journalistic history of the great Simpson Story the name of Newbold Noyes ranked high for his intimate reports of his visit to Fort Belvedere ten days before the abdication ( TIME , Dec. 28 ) . Rare authenticity attached to this extraordinary series because Mr. Noyes , 45 , is the dignified associate editor of the Washington Star , a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor , his father is president of the impeccable Associated Press , Mrs. Simpson is his cousin by marriage , and over all the Noyes pieces appeared an explicit imprimatur from both the interested parties . U. S. editors were surprised by but had to admire the racy , tabloidal flavor which Publisher Noyes achieved in his articles , reaching a peak in the King 's jocular query to Mr. Noyes asking if he had brought a shotgun to " cajole " him into marrying " Cousin " Wallis . <P> Professionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week by Mrs. Simpson which in effect branded the editor of the Washington Star as a gossipmonger and sob-writer of the lowest order . In Cannes , Mrs. Simpson announced to the world Press : " . . . Mrs. Simpson states that Mr. Noyes is not her cousin . . . . Neither the Duke of Windsor nor Mrs. Simpson ever gave Mr. Noyes any kind of interview . . . . Noyes was received at dinner by King Edward , but . . . the conversation on that occasion was solely of a general nature and took at no time the confidential turn indicated by Noyes in his articles . . . . Mrs. Simpson . . . authorized him only to publish a portrait in words of herself with the object of rectifying many fantastic reports concerning her person ally . Therefore Mrs. Simpson noted with amazement that the actual articles far exceeded in scope any possible portrait in words . . . . She has retained Matre Armand Grgoire , Paris attorney , to defend her interests . " Attorney Gregoire was reported considering suits for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ della Sera of Milan , which had car ried the Noyes articles after their U. S. publication . Mrs. Simpson had been discussing them with the Duke of Windsor by telephone to Enzesfeld and a wrong impression was abroad that Mrs. Simpson might be sharing in the financial returns of her relative 's exploit . It was all most painful to her and the Duke - and to Mr. Noyes in the U. S. it was excruciating . <P> Frantically , for 36 hours last week , Mr. Noyes tried to reach Mrs. Simpson by transatlantic telephone . She would not speak with him . Neither would her host and press buffer , Herman Rogers . This behavior so infuriated her cousin , Lelia Gordon Dickey Noyes , who married Newbold Noyes after divorcing Robert Russell Dickey Jr . ( TIME , Aug. 6 , 1934 ) , that she urged him to let Wallis have it now with both barrels and reveal much not yet revealed .
