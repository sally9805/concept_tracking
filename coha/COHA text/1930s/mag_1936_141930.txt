Ever since that September day in 1608 when Hendrik Hudson in his 80-ton Half Moon sailed 143 miles up from the sea to its site , Albany has had a maritime history . In 1686 , when it received the charter which today makes it the oldest incorporated city in the U. S. , the little Dutch fur trading post already was a prominent port . <P> Second U. S. skipper to sail into Canton , China , was Albany 's Captain Stewart Dean of the sloop Experiment in 1789 .
