txt Mr. Rogers Is Pleased Greatly With New Head of Teachers BEVERLY HILLS , Cal. , July 1 . ? America is a land of opportunity and do n't ever forget it . Yesterday out here in Los Angeles ( where our local papers say people are dying from heat by the thousands in the East , out here , we are just dying but for no particular reason at all ) ? well , there was elected to a very high office , president of the Educational Association , just a plain pleasant looking fat ( and enjoying it ) common sense woman . She is head of the rural schools in Maine . Now she is head of all the teachers in our land . I guess from her name , " Miss , " that she is an old maid , but , darn it , I just liked her looks in the paper this morning and I believe she could teach these young modern heathens of ours some sense . Yours , WILL ROGERS .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
