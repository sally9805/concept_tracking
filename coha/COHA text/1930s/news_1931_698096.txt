txt The article by Mr. RAYMOND HOOD in today 's . NEw YORK TIMES Magazine gives a glimpse of a new city  --  not let down from heaven but built up with towers that reach to the skies and look out over roofs that become as gardens . The area or " Radio City " is large enough to pro : - vide sufficient space between the towers to give a park or a garden to those who dwell about it above the tenth floors . If every like area in the city could be developed under such restriction , great towers would rise like trees in a garden , or a park  --  only springing from a level a hundred feet , more or less , above the street . CARRUSIER has given a glimpse in his imagination of such a city , and Mr. THOMAS ADAMS of the Regional Plan Committee has even suggested the relative areas of tower and garden , but here there is to be an actual urban apocalypse visible to the eyes of millions . The practical difficulty  --  which has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the surrounding roofs , which the towers at spacious intervals require to be treated as gardens , usually belong to Naboth while the tower is as the palace of Ahab . But there might be a plan of development which would give the high towers these garden spaces without injustice to the owners of the lower buildings . Such an intervallic treatment of areas above the old building heights would make of the upper city a new city of towers and gardens  --  with a memory of Babylon 's ziggurats and " hanging gardens " ? which were after all not " hanging " but " elevated , " rising in terraces from 75 to 200 or 300 feet above the plain . Mr. HOOD has spoken especially of the gardens , but the architecture of the towers would then become of more importance . Architects use the word " curtain " to describe the walls ( the weatherproofing " ) which surround the steel cages and have no part in supporting the structure . With roof spaces planted in gardens , greater attention must be given to the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Of other fabric than the curtains that enclosed the Tabernacle , they might with all the modern artistry in color and bas-relief be as those.prescribed in the Book of Exodus for the ancient Tent : Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle of ten curtains : of fine twined linen and blue and purple and scarlet , with cherubim the work of cunning workmen shalt thou make them . They were to be hung upon pillars of acacia that could not reach as high as steel and the gate was to have a screen of " blue and purple and scarlet . " A prophet later caught these hangings into an august simile when he saw the heavens " stretched out as a curtain " and " spread out as a tent to dwell in . " These great modern skyscrapers may indeed be as curtains spread out as tents for men to dwell in from which they may still look out upon gardens in the midst of the city .                    @
