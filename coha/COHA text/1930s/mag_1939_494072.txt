R. DEWEY SAID the other day that the New Deal is now defeatist in attitude . The charge seemed to me important if true , and so I went down to Washington to watch the wheels go round and see whether they were slowing up . The War Boom Falters. ? One 's first impression on visiting the nation 's capital is that something has cer ? tainly happened to business in the past few months . You ca n't get a berth on a sleeper , a seat in the diner , a porter in the station , or a taxi to a hotel . You are lucky to get a room ; even if you have a reservation you will have to wait in the lobby while some leisurely guest makes up his mind to vacate . The businessmen in the club car are telling each other gleefully how far behind they are on orders . As the train hurtles across the New Jersey landscape through the night , huge plants march along the horizon blazing with activity , working three shifts . The index of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking all past records , including those for the fabulous year of ' 29 . The Federal Reserve Board figure is about 13o as compared with an average a year ago of 86 . Nevertheless I found the men who watch the economic gauges for Uncle Sam far from glowing with rosy optimism . They look for a fairly severe recession in the early months of the coming year , though nothing like what we saw in 1929 or the middle of 1933 , or ' 37 . Their view , summarized roughly , is that we are having an inventory boom . When the war started , Americans remembered the shortages of 19/7-18 and rushed to buy , anticipating their actual needs for many months . They cleaned out the reserves of retailers , wholesalers and producers . Replenishing these reserves has caused the rush of busi ? ness , but the job is now about over . As for war orders from the Allies , the experts agree with Mr. E. D. Kennedy that over a period of years , such orders will no doubt be tremendous . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and France are already under way . In general , how ? ever , the feeling about war orders is that thus far , they simply do n't exist . British policy in particular is to buy everything possible inside the Empire , for obvious rea ? sons . On agriculture , the war effect thus far has on the whole been adverse rather than beneficial , since the accustomed markets have been cut off , partly for lack of shipping . England is giving a preference to the Argentine Republic , which in return has undertaken to link its currency with the pound and to confine its imports as far as possible to British products . For American business as a whole , and as of Decem ber , the war boom just is n't . We may be sure , too , that there will be no such runaway prices as were seen in the later stages of the last war , when several of the Allied countries had purchasing commissions in the United States bidding against each other , against the American government and private purchasers . Buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight purse-string . The Allies are assuming that the present ban on credits will be permanent and that they must husband their resources ? which the Federal Reserve Board now estimates at roughly $10,000,000,000 ? with the utmost care . Some of the New Deal experts think the United States is enjoying a boom for purely domestic reasons which have nothing to do with the war . They argue that enough time has elapsed since 1937 so that peo ? ple again need to buy for replacements whether they want to or not , that the banks are stuffed with money and that we have all the elements for a thoroughgoing credit inflation . It is this attitude which explains their belief that the bursting of the war bubble in January and February will not have too serious consequences . They recognize of course that we have not yet resolved the inward strains and contradictions of our economy and that unemployment hangs over us only slightly ameliorated by the upturn . ( It has become the fashion to say that with the growth in our population since 1929 an unemployment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /929 the number of employ ? ables has increased by perhaps 6,000,000 ; yet the num ? ber of unemployed is no larger than it was when the depression was at its worst . Therefore presumably we have somewhere absorbed five or six million of our previously unemployed . This seems to them less cold comfort than it does to me . ) The New Dealers are not at all enthusiastic about the President 's present mood of economy and some of them are equally sour about the vast expenditures that are contemplated under the head of national defense . They feel that spending on public works and unem ? employment relief is necessary and that new battleships and military airplanes probably are not . They wish , at any rate , that our military policy and needs could be subjected to full and frank public inquiry ? but they do n't expect it . 01 ' Man Third Term. ? The attitude of the New Dealers toward a third term for the President can be briefly stated . They hope he will run again ; they think the country needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assumption of his candidacy ? and they have not the slightest idea whether he will accept or not . It is my guess that the President shares this uncertainty . A few months ago , there was a good deal of pess ? imism in the New Deal ranks about the possibility of a Republican victory in 1940 , but this gloom has been dissipated in recent weeks . It was based on the realiza ? tion that the present Congress , elected in 1938 , is on the whole anti-Roosevelt and that it will indulge in some fancy smearing tactics in the session that begins next month . This expectation will certainly be fulfilled ; it is obvious , I think , that the Dies Committee is out to get the President and the New Deal . So is the House Committee " investigating " the National Labor Relations Board . The New Dealers , however , believe that at present the tide is running their way . They find that the conservatives of both parties support the President 's foreign policy . The old doctrine of " do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their favor whether the Democratic candidate should be the President or someone else acceptable to him . They are pleased by the reports that Mr. Roosevelt 's personal popularity has been growing in the polls of the Insti ? tute of Public Opinion . Some of them think Governor Bricker of Ohio may have given the kiss of death to Republican hopes in 1940 when he allowed the whole country to get the impression that the GOP is in favor of a balanced budget and starvation . ( The impression may be unjust , but who am Ito argue with a glacier ? ) Thurman Arnold 's Gallant Band. ? About the most interesting place in Washington to me is the office in the Department of Justice , where Assistant Attorney General Thurman Arnold is trying , with no thanks from the capitalists , to make capitalism work endur ? ably if not well . The political pressure that has been put on him to stop his campaign against monopolistic practices has been terrific , and it is decidedly to the credit of those with power to stop him that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the anti-trust laws . Everyone before ( except Solicitor General Robert H. Jackson ) has done this after a fashion so half ? hearted that it amounted to almost nothing . Mr. Arnold 's technique is simple , efficient and expensive ( expensive by old-fashioned standards , not by results obtained ) . He investigates one whole industry through ? out the country . If there is something wrong , if the ultimate consumer is getting a raw deal , if prices are kept unreasonably high by conspiracy , the Department cracks down . It gets an indictment by a federal grand jury , covering a big geographical area and including everybody who conspired ? and by everybody , oddly enough , Mr. Arnold means everybody . If it is feasible , there are both criminal and civil actions . Then Mr. Arnold puts it up to the alleged conspirators . If they are willing to stop their illegal practices he is willing to submit to the court for approval any constructive plan they may offer to make production or distribution more efficient and at the same time ensure competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity of criminal action . The unanimity and enthusiasm with which this course is selected are something wonderful to behold . Often a mere questioning before a grand jury is sufficient to produce a voluntary solution of a bad situation . Naturally , the Department keeps an eye on the operation of such plans to see that the planners do not have a relapse . No relapse , no more trouble . To do work of this sort needs many good men . Mr. Arnold has about a hundred smart young lawyers now , his own private brain trust , and a fine job they are doing . He needs at least 150 more in order to police the gigantic industries of this big and lively country . He thinks in terms of a man in each state who would be a sort of " consumers ' counsel " roughly comparable to the county agent of the Department of Agriculture . Another hundred men would be a flying wedge to be sent here and there as trouble developed . To make a beginning at this work , Mr. Arnold needs $2,000,00o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it does , consider the fact that our national economy is worth eighty billions or so a year when it is healthy , fifty or sixty billions when it is not . A very important aspect of ill health is artificial high prices ? prices which cur ? tail consumer purchasing power , cause unemployment , prevent our using and enjoying the things to which our technology entitles us . ( In the case of housing , for example , high prices have meant that houses sim ? ply are not built at all . ) Two million dollars is one ? forty-thousandth of eighty billions . That is not such a high insurance rate . In some lines of activity , Mr. Arnold has found labor unions apparently participating in conspiracies against the consumer 's pocketbook . He has found them refusing to handle materials that did not come from the high-price ring . He has found them requiring use ? less work to be done at big wages to give a union man a job . He has found the employer victimized in a struggle between two unions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arnold has not hesitated to include the offi ? cers of such unions in his conspiracy indictments , and in so doing he has brought down on his head the furious rage of some union leaders , notably William Green of the AFL . These leaders confine their argument ? ment to a single point : that the Clayton Act exempts them from the operations of the anti-trust laws . Whether this is true is for the Supreme Court to say ; many good lawyers think it is false . But false or true , it is a miserably weak argument for the unions to bring before the American people . This country has never very much liked people who , accused of wrongdoing , reply that they have technical legal immunity . It is particularly dangerous to talk this way now when hos ? tility toward all labor unions is steadily mounting in a Congress that is on the whole anti-New Deal . Mr. Green and his cohorts are stamping right onto the fly ? paper ; they may live to regret it . Long-range Thinking about the Farmer. ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where some highly competent experts spend most of their time thinking about the future of the American farm . In spite of all the past efforts , that future is in some ways none too bright ( and would be far darker still were it not for the things done by the New Deal since 1933 ) . The men who speak for our six or seven million farm families , representing a total population of about 30,000,000 , wish very much that Congress would stop looking at the agricultural situation as an emergency and begin to think of it as a permanent problem . They wish , in other words , that it were not necessary to go hat in hand to the national legislature every year beg ? ging for funds with which to do a job that is absolutely vital to the maintenance of our national prosperity . That job , in a word , is to give the American farmer , as far as is possible , his fair share of the national in ? come . This represents not only justice to the farmer but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy nation on a sick agriculture . In general , the Department is still working on the lines that have been laid down by Secretary Wallace , who is more popular with his own associates than with some other people in Washington who do n't know him so well . One basis of the policy is the " ever-normal granary " ? storing up non-perishable farm products , with government aid , in times of plenty and releasing them in bad crop years or other periods of enhanced demand . To this end , and to help the farmer himself , crop loans are made on that part of production which represents legitimate domestic consumption , at prices set by the Department according to formulas that were laid down by Congress as fair . Nobody worries if some ? times these prices prove to be , temporarily , a little higher than the market , since the purpose of the plan is to keep the farmer afloat and not to earn a gambling profit . Payments are also made , as everyone knows , to farmers who limit their production in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservation . The experts believe that this effort is of the greatest importance ; in spite of all the hullabaloo about conservation in this country in recent years we are still destroying the land faster than we repair it . Our best efforts do not prevent surpluses in certain products , and as to a few , the Department has reluct ? antly embarked upon a program of subsidizing exports . We have of course bitterly criticized other countries in the past for doing the same thing , and those crit ? icisms were correct ; it is a form of economic warfare . As soon as possible it will be stopped and the Depart ? ment will be far happier when this happens . Meanwhile , domestic dumping is also being used and is on a far different moral footing . The Surplus Commodities Corporation has given away large amounts of food to people on relief to supplement their diet , which is always inadequate and often desper ? ately so . This plan has now been modified into the food-stamp scheme under which in certain cities relief clients when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tional so cents ' worth chosen at their option from a specified list of products . The Department is greatly pleased with the results of this plan and hopes to extend it widely . Whatever you may think of it , you can not go back of the argument that the 20,000,000 people now receiving public aid must be given enough food to keep them healthy : our national well-being , after all , is our No. ' asset . An important aspect of the old AAA was processing taxes to aid the producer . The flour miller , for in ? stance , paid a tax on every ton of flour he ground , the money eventually going to the producer and the cost being passed on to the consumer , when necessary , in the form of slightly higher prices . The Supreme Court ( with five members who are not there now ) overturned the processing taxes on the ground that they were an improper means of bringing about crop reduction , but raised no fundamental objection to the taxes themselves . ( They still exist in relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sim ? plified form of processing tax which would not require the intervention of the Treasury at all . If this plan were applied to cotton , for instance , and if the market price was lower than seemed desirable , a parity pay ? ment would be set ; let us call it , for illustration , three cents a pound . The cotton planter who had complied with all Department regulations would be given cer ? tificates representing that share of his crop legitimately usable in the domestic market . When he took his cot ? ton to market , the owner of the gin would be required to buy these certificates at the stipulated price per pound . He must then send certificates to the Department cov ? ering the amount of business he had done . This plan is far simpler than the old system of putting taxes into the Treasury and writing checks against them . You will hear a good deal more about it in the near future . Some of the long-range thinkers in the Department are beginning to get concerned about excess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country as a whole . Great changes have taken place in agriculture in recent years ; farming certain crops in some regions has become uneconomic under competitive conditions ; the mechanization of many processes is reducing the amount of labor needed . The cotton-picking machine is slow in arriving but it seems to be on its way ; news ? paper reports describe a successful machine for harvest ? ing sugar-cane , and there are other devices going into use . There is little point in driving displaced agricul ? tural population into the cities , which already have is grave unemployment problem of their own . There are also definite limits to the idea of equipping the un ? wanted farm family with ten acres and a mule , to try to live on what it can grow , with cash crops . It begins to look to some of the experts as though we might need a rural job-creating program , giving people work which would not consist in growing more crops . Just what that work should be , they are not prepared to say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as tired of the war as people everywhere . Rumors of an early peace fill the air ? rumors which , so far as I can see , have little foundation . The alarm that was felt when the war first began lest the United States should get into it forthwith has much abated . No one thinks Mr. Roosevelt has lost any of his extremely active personal interest in the cause of the Allies or his desire to help them by " measures short of war . " It is believed , however , that he was deeply impressed by the overwhelming isolationist sentiment of the country displayed during the debate on neutrality . To be sure , Germany and Russia continue to play into his hands by doing everything possible to turn American public opinion against them . Still , I found that most people feel there is a good chance that we shall stay out , espe ? cially if the war continues with its present list of belli ? gerents . If it should turn into a Holy War Against Russia , with Germany switching sides and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different story . Are We Downhearted ? ? The general answer to the question with which I started seems to me to be No . The New Dealers have not , so far as I can judge , aban. doned their purposes nor have they given way to a mood of defeatism . They recognize the possibility that the Republicans may win in 1940 , as to which they make two comments : First , that the country has moved forward a long way since 1932 , and that even a con ? servative GOP regime would not dare to do very much to social security , the National Labor Relations Act , the TVA and similar projects , the CCC , the agricul ? tural program , the wages-and-hours law . Second , if the Republican leadership is as uncertain as it appears to be , the New Deal is likely to come back in 1944 . In the meantime , its proponents are trying to nail down as much as possible against the danger of a Re ? publican victory that they do not really expect . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tion on important matters with which the next admin ? istration will deal . They believe that truth is on their side and that in the long run , truth is a mighty weapon . This attitude may be defeatism , but in any case , it is one of which we could stand a good deal more .
