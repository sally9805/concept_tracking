txt Stimulated by the higher prices for crude oil made effective early last April , drilling in oil fields and prospective areas In recent weeks has become more active . Indications of this trend are evident in reports from the Southwest activity and where the cost of drilling is comparatively low , the completions of new oil wells last week reached a record for such period at 160 . While drilling has been mare active , it has been far from the rate in previous years . In the first three months of thin year , 2,883 wells were completed in fields in the United States , of which 1,888 were oil producing , whereas In the corresponding period of 1931 the total was 3,141 , of which 1,320 were successful oil producers . By far the most completions were in East Texas , where at the end of March 283 wells Were drilling . Prices a Governing Factor Drilling for oil varies in direct relation to the course of crude oil prices . With the drastic falling off in crude oil quotations in the first six months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , drilling declined sharply In most sections . In 1929 the total of oil and gas wells and failures drilled was 26,356 , the largest total since 1926 , but in 1930 the number had fallen to 21,240 and last year was further reduced to 12,432 . Almost 30% of 1931 wells drilled were dry holes . By and large , the production of crude oil continues to be kept under good control , although in Texas and California there is not the same assurance as in Oklahoma . For the first quarter this year the production of crude in the United States averaged 2,160.000 barrels daily , against 2475,000 daily in the like 1931 period . There has been a slight increase In May , due primarily to seasonal considerations , refiners normally increasing their runs of crude to stills to some extent in this period . Thera is some danger , in view of the lower conaumption of gasoline , however , that refiners may make too great ap increase in operations , which see5A ; reflect back on the crude output situation . Oil Field Employment Rises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Employment in the oil fields of Pottawatomie and Seminole counties , the Greater Seminole field region , has shown a marked upward trend in the last few weeks . More than 1,000 workers have been reemployed and the oil field payroll has increased at the rate of ; 300,000 annually during the last two months . In many cases a five-day week prevails . Oil company officials emphasize the fact they are not employing new workers , but are reemploying men who were laid off several months ago when oil prices slumped and demand fell off . The south Oklahoma City oil field has crossed the 100,000,000-barrel mark in production . The discovery well came in December 4 , 1928 . There are slightly more than 900 producing wells in the field , but the east and south sides show a series of dry holes . Extension of the field to the north and west is limited by city ordinances prohibiting extension of the drilling area , though no limits to actual productivity have been defined . As a single field , the south city pool is ahead of any in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Greater Seminole region . The Oklahoma City recovery , however , is far below the entire recovery to date of the Greater Seminole area , which includes pools with total production to date ranging from a few barrels up to more than 100,000,000 barrels . Oil Price Trend Aids Steel Rprciai to Tae WALL STRELT JOURNAL YOUNGSTOWN  --  The trend of prices in the oil industry during the remainder of 1932 will provide a good index to tbe degree of business recovery of a large part of the steel industry . Hopes for improvement in steel pipe requirements of the oil country will be measured by further increases in prices of oil . Observers of the steel industry believe , therefore , that from the viewpoint of pipe manufacturers as well as of oil companies , the recent tendency to advance prices is encouraging . The more conservative of the pipe manufacturers are hopeful that within a year and a half much of the present 011 surplus will have been worked off , and that drilling on a wider scale will have been resumed . Until oil prices , accompanying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at present , there is little in prospect for that part of the steel industry producing tubular goods . Failure of the construction industry , the second largest outlet for steel pipe , to recover thus far in 1932 , has also been reflected in current business of steel pipe producers . Approximately 67% of the steel pipe produced this year has gone to the oil , gas , water , mining and lumbering industries , only 13% into building . Youngstown district plants producing automobile steel , for example , have been more active in 1932 than the pipe plants , although all have been at low production levels . . Hence developments in the oil and gas industries  --  heavy tonnage outlets  --  are now being closely watched by manufacturers of pipe . C. E. Arnott , spokesman for the oil group , said that they had met with the Russians Monday afternoon . The meeting was devoted to clarifying points of the various proposition submitted . No further conference with the Russians will be held until Friday , Mr. Arnott stated .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
