The slow hum of Zeppelins at night was World War I 's high horror note for civilians of Britain and France. * This war 's note was so confidently expected to be the shattering bellow of dive-bombers that congested areas of France and England were evacuated before war was declared . Through last week , no such note was heard except for a non-bombing visit toward Paris by a few Nazi reconnaissance ships , who retreated as soon as spotted , and a jittery performance near Britain 's big Thames-mouth base at Chatham . <P> Although the British censor passed several conflicting reports on this affair ( see p. 25 ) , a later " official report " set the gossip straight . A German squadron had indeed started over Chatham . Home fighters had indeed gone up . But so prompt were they , so excited their brother gunners below , that when they returned ( after scaring off the German eagles ) their own guns powed them . One British pilot crashed dead . <P> Actual extent of Allied and German flights in the war 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic could tell . From official communiques , however , it appeared that except for Germany 's Polish push , the one big show of the week was put on by England . <P> One cloudy afternoon Dutchmen heard the drumming of war engines as a big flight of bombers sped east across The Netherlands , safe from anti-aircraft fire above a thick overcast . From their course , air-wise Dutchmen ( who protested this violation of their neutrality ) concluded they were headed for three Nazi naval bases ( Wilhelmshaven , Cuxhaven , Brunsbttel ) , clustered in a 50-mile circle around the North Sea mouth of the Kiel Canal . They were right . <P> Warned by the rumble of approaching motors ( and probably by espionage reports ) , Nazi anti-aircraft men , crouched beside their guns , had no targets until the British raiders burst from the overcast in a driving rainstorm . Out of formation peeled the raiders . Down they dropped in screaming power dives , slamming heavy bombs at some of the juiciest bombing targets in Germany : men-of-war and vital establishments in docks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuit could get into the air the raiders had crawled back into the overcast and headed for home , after a lively half hour or so with every machine gun and anti-aircraft cannon in the area whanging away at them . Next day Britain announced that severe damage had been done to a battleship lying alongside the mole at Brunsbttel , that hits had been made on a second man-of-war off Wilhelmshaven . Few days later an unconfirmed dispatch from Switzerland said the 26,000-ton Gneisenau had been sunk . Germany denied it , said its anti-aircraft men had knocked down five of the twelve British raiders . Britain announced there had been " some casualties . " <P> Other air activities of the week summarized thus : <P> &gt; A British bombing attack on the German base-island of Sylt off Denmark 's southwest corner . Obvious object : to destroy the extensive anti-aircraft establishment there , pave the way for other raids on the naval bases . No results were announced but this week German civilians were evacuated . <P> &gt; French ( and probably British ) bombers visited over Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to test their defenses . No details .
