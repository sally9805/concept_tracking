WANTED ON THE VOYAGE A STORY BY SYLVIA THOMPSON D v Bran had always been bright . Her teacher had advised her mother to send her on to Secondary School ; and in her last year there she went to the Polytechnic Evening Classes to learn typing and shorthand and bookkeeping . She was only eighteen when she got her job with Marx , Denham &; Klein , the rubber people in Mincing Lane . She held her job there , and one day Mr. Denham himself congratulated her on her work . And with Mr. Denham she knew it was because her work was good , not because she was pretty . Mr. Klein noticed when she had a new scarf or necklace on or her hair set in a different way . But it was Mr. Denham she admired , his clothes and his way of speaking , and the way his hands were kept , clean and gentlemanly , with the nails cut square . She often talked to her family about Mr. Denham and how his clothes all came from Leslie &; Roberts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books on his desk written in French that had nothing to do with the business at all , and a picture by a French Artist called Chardin hung in his room . She liked Mr. Denham for not looking at her as if she was pretty . It was part of his being such a gentleman . She saw Mrs. Denham once and admired her too . She was just the sort of wife he ought to have , ever so smart and fascinating , and yet you 'd never think for a moment she was anything but a lady . She wore allblack and a narrow diamond bracelet over her black sleeve . That winter Lily wore all black . She gut a paste bracelet at SeIfridge 's that looked quite good and wore it over her sleeve . When she went out with Ed he said , " Whatever d' you want to dress as if you was in mourning for ? " Ed was a nice enough fellow but he had no eye for style , and did n't ever read anything except the newspapers . She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their wedding . He looked sort of stupid and stiff dressed up as a bridegroom , and Grace wore a smoke-gray crepe-de-chine that did n't fit her anywhere , and they went off afterward to Southend where Ed had taken Lily once for that day , when she would n't eat winkles or go on the Giant Racer with him , and he told her she was getting stuck up . They had come back in the train not speaking , and the rain splintering on the dark windows , and all the other people in the carriage making a row and singing ; and when he left her at the gate outside her people 's house she had just told him , quietly , that she felt they were n't really suited to each other . But when he 'd gone off in the rain , with his coat collar turned up without saying much , she had felt sort of sick and alone and wanted him back again , to put his arms round her . But she had seen reason again in the morning , and her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above him , Lil . " WANTED ON She told her family about the office , and they were ever so proud of how she got on . Her father was a shopwalker in Benson 's , the big store in the High Street near the District Station . He had been there nearly twenty-six years . He was a slight man with a gray mustache and pince-nez , who drank too much strong tea and liked to work week-ends in the little garden at the back . He used often to look at Lil and marvel at her ; but he never said more than , " You are n't doing too badly , " or " You do n't look bad in that dress . " Her mother was a big vital woman who had been accountant in the butcher 's shop over the bridge before she married . She had a quick , sensible brain and her presence was warm and comfortable like a stove . She looked what she was ? kindly and full-blooded . She was fond of stout and smoked-ham and buttered toast . Lil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she was built slender like her father . Lil told them about Mr. and Mrs. Denham , how they went to St. Moritz in the winter and to Biarritz in the summer , and her father said , " Travel 's a wonderful thingl " And her mother , knitting a blue cardigan , said , " I daresay . But there 's no place like home all the same . " Lil was always going in for Competitions in the newspapers . She liked the fun of it , crosswords or puzzles or anything . But she always said , " It 's useless hoping to get a prize . I do n't believe they really give the big ones . " All the same she could n't help wondering sometimes what she 'd do if she were to get one of them . There was the series of crosswords in the Sunday News that offered a motor car , 1st prize ; a radio gramophone , 2nd ; and a solid silver tea service , 3rd1 But she did n't even get an Award : although she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was Mr. Klein at the office who one day handed her the Daily Bulletin . Mr. Klein always found any excuse to talk to her . He said , " I know you 're a puzzle fan , Miss Birdl Have a try at this . It looks too eassy for a defer young woman like youl " Lil thanked him and took the paper out with her at the lunch hour , and read it while she ate her poached-egg on toast , crowded elbow to elbow in the A.B.C . round the corner . There was a series of pictures , and you had to find Great Names in History hidden in them . In one there was a cobblestone in the form of a " D " next to a garden rake , and this she spotted as Drake at once . The others looked as if they might be as simple . On the way home , straphanging in the District train , she solved five more . Anyway she made out Edison , and Watt , which was " Kilo " crossed out , followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who liked puzzles too , joined in ; and they made out Napoleon and Nelson together . Her father , toasting his toes and reading Through Wildest Africa , glanced up several times and wondered how ever they got at it . But then Amy , his wife , was as quick as they 're made about those things ( except that she never could think out about the Daylight Saving giving them an hour more or less sleep ) ; and Lil had always been bright . " Maybe Lily 'll get First Prize , " he said . Lil glanced up , pencil poised in one white pretty hand . " Round Trip to New York , first class on the Atalanta .. I do n't think ! " " You never know , " said her father . He added , " I 've often thought I would n't mind crossing the oshun . " " Eastanwest home 's best they do say , " said Amy Bird , and then , " Look ' ere ' What about Shake-speare for that one ? . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the slab there . . . and spear 's the chewing-gum with the ' mint ' crossed off ! " The morning she got the letter from the Daily Bulletin she came into the office late and with such a color that even Mr. Denham , who was waiting for her to take a letter , noticed immediately and said when she 'd taken it , " You look very fit , Miss Bird . " And because she really hardly knew if she was coming or going , she smiled and then started blurting it all out . " Well , I 've won first prize in a competition , sir . " And Mr. Klein came in at that moment and she could n't stop herself telling them both . " First Class return to New York and forty-eight hours ashore and on the Atalanta ! " " Well you'fe got your bit of luck ! Hafe n't you ? Let me congratulate you ! " " Thank you , Mr. Klein . " She smiled . ( He was n't a bad sort really although he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when are you going ? " " Well . . . Mr. Klein . . . I can choose the date " ? she just went on smiling because she could n't help it ? " as tong as it 's in the summer . So I thought maybe I could arrange my holiday so as to go then . " " Certainly . We will see about that . " Mr. Klein 's bulging brown eyes were looking hard at her in the way he did sometimes that disgusted her . But to-day she did n't even care when he added , with one of his shiny looks , that a girl like her was sure to have all the men on board running after her . She did n't mind at all . She rather liked it . It started her thinking all in a sort of enchanted muddle , and with this beating of excitement in her head , about what she 'd wear , and if there 'd be dancing , and about young men in white flannels and in evening dress with brown serious faces ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the advertisements . . . . She 'd get a Ladies Pictorial pattern book at the lunch hour . . . A dancing dress in floral chiffon perhaps but simple in style . . . . And one or two of those sunback dresses in piqu ? .. . and perhaps a scarlet belt and monogram . The telephone . . . . " Yes . This is Marx , Denham Ft Klein speaking ( and a pair of silver-kid dancing slippers ) . . Yes . . . I 'll just see if Mr. Denham is engaged ( and of course people spoke to one another on board ship ; they did n't have to wait for introductions ) .. . I 'm putting you through to Mr. Denham . . . " ( We are delighted to inform you that the Daily Bulletin Competitions Committee have decided to award to you . . . RETURN FIRST CLASS TRIP . ) The Cunard offices had nothing to offer Alan Farringdon except an inside cabin on D , or a double cabin on Deck B. Alan glanced at the plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He said , " The double on B and I 'll write you a check now . " " Return ? " the young man was asking . " No . Single . " The offices were as hot as the street . The young man was saying that the Atalanta sailed on Wednesday at noon . " At noon , " said Alan stupidly . " How hot . " And then , " What day do we arrive in New York ? " " You should arrive Monday morning , " said the young man proudly . " Monday morning , " Alan repeated . " Could you give me some ink for my pen ? . . . Monday ! . . . That 's twodays then ? " " Four and half we reckon it , " said the young man with satisfaction . " And if you would n't mind filling in this form first ? " ( Would she answer his cable ? And then , supposing after all , she was n't there ? It was so like her , that drifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceivably like  --  to  --  to Connecticut ! . . . and nothing except " my Bank wilt forward all picture post cards . " ) The young man was talking about the Head Tax . . . . When Alan Farringdon was a little boy he had slept for four years alone in a room and for four years every night he had been afraid . But he had never told his parents ( who had cared for nothing so much as his happiness and serenity of mind ) . The fear which the little boy had so dreadfully felt , and the pride which had prevented him from telling , were still in the face of the man of thirty who walked out of the Cunard offices in Street , up the Haymarket , along Piccadilly . It was the face of a man whose imagination and desires were kept under control , but at the cost of his nerves . The hazel eyes were full of light and un-WANTED ON certainty ; the bones of his face were vigorous but pressed too close under the tanned skin ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little rigidly . His movements were just too quick ; and this afternoon as he went through the streets in the July heat his haste had a quality of panic . Perhaps he became aware of this , for in Curzon Street he slowed and strolled from Shepherds Market to Number 24 . The striped awnings were out , so that indoors the rooms were dark and cool . His man said , " There 's a cable for you , Sir . " There it was on the chimney piece ; pale blue against a bowl of yellow roses . He took it to the window to read it in the pallor flowing in from under the awnings . " Absurd to pursue me now . Good-by . Sonya . " He turned back into the room , went to the writing table , wrote out her name and the address of her bank on an envelope , and " Sailing A talanta Wednesday . " He gave it to his man to send off at the post office in Queen Street . When he was alone he read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Pursue " was so one of " her words " ( she said , " Let 's pursue a meal , a drink , an exhibition of pictures , " as she said , " Let 's complicate , " meaning let 's think of something new or curious or funny to do ) . Thinking of her words , the room was suddenly empty of her . She was n't leaning , one hand on the curve of her waist , against the chimney piece . She was n't standing turned away from him ( her small head , her wide shoulders , her slender back ) by the high bookshelf in the corner , taking out one book after another and not reading it . She was n't on the balcony , in a black suit , leaning with her elbows on the iron rail and , half intent , half laughing , inventing private lives for the people going past in the street below . He went to her photographs standing on the writing table , and turned them downward . All her photographs were women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized now that even his mind had no static memory of her ; that he could remember only her changing expressions , her slow or swift gestures , and her voice , that was most lovely when in one of her rare shivering moments of emotion she could say nothing but " Oh " or " Darling " . . . or her out-of-breath " Alan , I 'm pleased ! " He remembered , in those final minutes , her gesture of utter nonchalance , her look quivering between hatred and laughter , her pallor , her red lips , and the ludicrous black elegance of her little hat . He remembered his own words , at the end of the too familiar dialogue . His " We ought to be able to respect each other 's freedom . " " But we do n't ! We ca n't ... and by now we ought to know that it 's futile even to try ! " Lily came on board in the navy-blue linen suit and the panama hat and white shoes ; and everything was too bright and crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real second at Waterloo Station when she minded leaving Mother and Dad , and yet felt ashamed and relieved they did n't come with her to the boat . So she came on board alone , walking up the gangplank and stepping into the boat as if it did n't mean more to her than it did to any of the other hundreds of people pushing to and fro . And when one of the men in white coats and white-covered caps said , " Which way , Miss ? " she heard her own voice saying quite sensibly , " Cabin B 51 . " There was a basin with hot and cold running water and a bed , brass with a box-spring mattress ; and pile carpet , pink ; and chintzy curtains just as in a classy hotel room , and four toothglasses in all . And her luggage was there , the imitation crocodile dressing bag , the navy " Revelation " case Father had got through the wholesale ; and the American-cloth hatbox she had had from Ed last Christmas looking ever so nicel And suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cabin made her know she really was starting out for the trip ! And as she turned to the glass , there was her face that she saw only this morning early ( that seemed an age ago ) in the familiar glass in her room at home , and now looking back at her startled and dark-eyed under the white peak of her hat . And now a throbbing and quivering began round her in the white cabin and then a long blind hooting that cut in a widening blade of sound across her nerves . And then , in the silence , she heard a voice in the gangway outside , " We 're off . . . . " He leanedon the rail andwatched Cherbourg dissolve into the hazy line of coast . There had been no cable for him at Cherbourg  --  No reason why there should be . But persistent stupid hoping ever since Southampton had made him expect one . Though why should she even think out where his boat would be ? He began moving , then strolling , then pacing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always began by imagining what he 'd say , quite quickly , and with indifference to her ; and worked up , in his imagination more and more wordless , more vivid and silent and maddened , until his hand was on her throat ( her firm warm throat ) , his fingers tightened . . . . He spun round , gripped a rail , swung himself up a companionway to where a crowd was playing deck tennis . Most of the girls were in bathing dresses ; two were in shorts . He stopped and watched the game without seeing it . The people round him were the usual business-and-pleasure English-American crowd , cheerfully intent on taking exercise by day and organizing gaiety by night . As Alan turned away to find an emptier deck he noticed a girl in a white dress with a red belt ; she was the only woman there who was n't anatomically an open hook . She was holding on a wide straw hat so that he could n't see her face . But as he went down the companionway she turned so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her face set in the huge halo of her hat . A vivid face , he thought . But rather tiresomely " pretty . " The handsome young man with the melancholy expression was only two tables off at dinner and once she felt he was looking at her , so she went on looking away , until she was sure he was n't looking any more , and then , while she was helping herself to the bombe glaci which the attentive waiter ( or was he called a steward too ? ) handed her she managed to look at him again . He was wearing a dinner jacket and a soft shirt , but somehow it seemed to look all right on him , and his waiter was bringing a great huge glass and pouring some sort of wine into it , but hardly enough to show ! He looked up and spoke to the waiter , and there was something in his ways that put her in mind of Mr. Denham ! She stopped looking directly at him any more just in case he might notice ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wondered if she should smoke ? Most of the women were smoking . But then one or two of the more refined-looking ones were n't . And she had a sort of feeling always that men did n't like to see women smoke in public , any more than they liked to see them with those bright-colored varnishes on their nails . She always kept her own a pale rose . ( Maisie Dean in the office had hers scarlet like the woman at the next table . But it did look " fast . " There was no getting away from it . ) Lily drank her coffee , keeping her glance down on the table , her little finger lifted away from the little cup . At nine o'clock there would be dancing . She had seen that chalked on the notice-board by the Purser 's office . She decided she would go and sit in the lounge leading out of the ballroom , taking a book with her . She finished her coffee and rose . Alan Farringdon , glancing up as she passed his table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the same girl he 'd seen on the sports deck , in a big hat . Her bloomy skin and dark eyes and something WANTED ON about the full curved under-lip of her small mouth reminded him of the portrait of " Lady Hamilton as a Bacchante . " When Alan had had a second brandy he went up to the radio room . He wrote out a radio to Sonya . " Shall probably proceed to China . " Then he walked round the upper deck . A huge dusk was deepening and pressing down over the rippling sheen of the sea . He paused astern , diverted by the way the ship flared her white plumed train in her wake . A couple passed behind him . The woman said , " . . . but of course you can overdo sunbathing , " and the man said , " That 's true . But then you can overdo anything , ca n't you ? " Alan relit his cigar . . . . What the hell was Sonya doing in Connecticut anyway ? Why must she always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendship , from one interest to another ? Why could n't she come to some sort of sane final conclusion about herself , and her tastes ... and her feelings ? Why could n't she , sometimes , behave like a normal woman ? As he turned and went down to the covered deck he thought out a remark , for her , about " all conscious deviation from the normal being a sign of mediocrity . " She would of course , as she always did , bring her defense round to the statement that she was not " a person " and " a woman , " but a self ; and that she must love him ( if she loved him . .. and when she loved him ! ) in her own way ; and escape him , when she did , for no reason , escape him , because this was what she , and probably he too , needed ! He crossed the deck rapidly to the lighted interior . The band in the ballroom was playing " One Night of Love . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He went through the lounge toward the ballroom . The girl was sitting in a corner . She looked up as he came in . Then looked at her book again . He went up to her and said , " Excuse me . Would you care to dance ? " She hesitated . She colored . She had brown eyebrows spread like wings . She pressed her shut book awkwardly between her hands and then said in a musical but mincing tone , " Thank you . I do n't mind if I do . " She put her book on the little table and rose . " It 's a waltz , " he said . " So it is ! " He followed her into the too lighted ballroom . They moved into the crowd of dancers . She danced well , but holding her head a little stiffly . He guessed this was shyness . He wondered what she was ? " How well you dance , " he said . " D' you think so ? " " I do . " English suburban obviously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yet . . . Not a mannequin ; she was n't sophisticated enough in her own way . Certainly not Stage , of any kind . She had n't that give and take , that sitting-easy-to-life quality . She asked , " Are you fond of dancing ? " " Very . " " Not a bad band , is it ? " " Very adequate . " Her glance stayed for a second , but without coquetry , on his face . " How d' you like this ship ? " he asked . Now she was n't looking at him any more . Close under his glance it was the bloomy warmth of her skin that was attractive . " I like it all right . It 's very nice I think . " Now they swung to where the floor in the center of the room was less crowded . He asked : " Are you going to stay in America ? " " Oh , no . I 'm just doing the round trip . " " I see , " he said abruptly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only four days now until New York . Would Sonya answer ? Had she got his radiogram yet ? But her bank would have to forward . . . . The sudden sharp conjecture that Sonya was probably in the country at this moment , with one of her young men , sent his mind back to the impulse of revenge which prompted every flirtation he had with every other woman . The girl was talking to him . " I 'm so sorry , " he said . " I was preoccupied with that couple who seem bent on tripping us upl " ( He 'd be able to say to Sonya ? " There was a ravishing Little Bit on the boat . . . . " ) " Some people never know when they 're not wanted , " she agreed , and gave a little laugh . When the music stopped he went back with her to her corner in the lounge . He said , " Let 's sit here . It 's nice . There are n't too many people . And what about something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowered skirts each side of her . " What 'll you have ? " he said when the steward came . " An orangeade , please ! " ' Nothing stronger ? Whisky ? Brandy ? A liqueur ? " " No , thanks so much . I never touch anything ! " He ordered a brandy for himself . Then he told her that his name was Alan Farringdon . And what was hers ? " Miss Lily Bird ? " he repeated . " How pretty ! " She had never thought of that . She smiled suddenly , not in the stilted way she 'd smiled before . He picked up the book she had been reading when he first spoke to her . It was the Forsyte Saga . He asked her if she enjoyed Gals-worthy 's novels . She said this was the first of his she had read . The people in it seemed very natural and true to Iife . She liked a good novel now and again she said , and asked him his favorite author . He said his favorite author was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he 's French , " she said with her genteel little laugh . " D' you like French pictures too ? " she asked . " Very much . " " Did you ever see any pictures by a French artist called Chardin ? " He said , " Yes , " surprised . " Well , I never ! " and she gave him a funny little quick smile . He wanted to know why . But she shook her head saying , " Just a coincidence , that 's all ! " But she was more at ease after this , although she did n't seem to want to go on talking about French pictures . But she asked him questions . Was he in business ? Had he been to America before ? What did he think of the rumba ? She thought it " common . " And she answered his questions , nearly always by ready-made phrases such as " I like the country , but only in good weather , " or " I like to see a really good play now and again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed to be her own ; as when she said that a woman who passed them , red-faced in a white tulle scarf , looked " like a prawn popping out of a paper bag . " When they had danced twice again , and she said that it was time for her to be " getting to bye-byes , " he said he hoped to see her the next morning . This provoked one of her automatic exhibitions of coyness . " You may and may not , " she said . But her look , a moment later as she said good-night was grave and friendly and , as it had been in that first moment , a little shy . One thing Lily was determined was that he should n't get the idea that she was one of those easy girls , only too pleased to make friends with anybody . So she did n't come on deck until nearly twelve , and then she went straight to her chair and lay back and started reading . But she was n't prepared , when she heard his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart jump in such a silly way . He took an empty chair beside her . " I hope you slept well . " " Yes , thanks . " " I 've been looking for you every-where . " " I bet you have n't ! " " Cigarette ? " " No , thanks . " " Did you swim this morning ? " " No . " " Just lazy ! " " That 's about it . " She added , with only a second 's hesitation , " I do n't usually get up till twelve o'clock . " This surprised him . He remembered one of Sonya 's perverse little aphorisms about people who had fixed their hour of getting up had fixed fifty per cent of their character . ( Sonya herself got up one day at seven and another at ten , just as she breakfasted one day off orange juice , and the next off kidneys and bacon and eggs and sausages . ) Thinking of this , he turned to Lily . His smile , that began as though it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her plan to be stand-offish . He said : " As you 've stayed away all the morning I 'm going to insist on your lunching with me . Will you ? " " Thanks . " " Good . We 'll lunch in the Verandah Grill upstairs . I 'll go up and make sure they keep us a tablel " She watched his hurried graceful moving away down the deck . His flannels were a perfect cut ! And no one had ever had a table kept for her before . She got to be friendly with quite a lot of very nice people . But if anyone had asked her , by the third day of the trip , to describe each of them , or repeat any of the conversations she had had with them , she would n't have given more than a few hazy descriptions ; remembering that Mrs. Wabash had been twice round the world , or Mr. Lemuel was a naturalist who went orchid-hunting ; or that Mr. and Mrs. Trotter ( with whom she had struck up , by all appearance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America and had been visiting Paris and London . But about The Honorable Alan Farringdon ( she had found him in the passenger list ) she knew that he was going to America to visit relations ; that he was unmarried and , from certain of his hints , had had a disappointment in love ; that he was " in the law " in some way ; that he was fond of reading and music and travel , but wished he had a home of his own in the country ; that he drank quite a bit of wine and brandy after his dinner ( though he certainly never seemed the worse for it , and the habit might quite well be got from being so much alone and brooding too much , as he was clearly in the habit of doing ) . She knew all these things . But when she started thinking about him , as she did the second evening in her cabin ( they had been out on deck together in the moonlight , but he never so much as attempted to take her arml @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had about him so much as feelings ; or anyway , whatever started off by being a thought ended up by being a sort of queer restless warm feeling . The third night she dreamed that they were up on the deck together talking and that he suddenly took her in his arms and kissed her . And when she woke she thought how queer to dream of being kissed by an Honorable , which was as good as being kissed by an Earl really ; because one day Mr. Farringdon would be one ! But as she was dressing , putting on the white skirt and the scarlet " halter-top " she remembered her dream again and meeting her own gaze in the glass , colored , and turned away . He said , " D' you know when I first saw you I thought you looked like Lady Ham-ilton . " They were lying in their deck chairs after luncheon , on the fourth day . " I hope it 's a compliment , whoever she is . " " It is . She was ravishing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not Alan ? " This , he thought , is going to be a pleasant flirtation . She was really very pretty ! " Well .. . " " Unless you call me Alan I ca n't call you Lily , which is how I think of you . " " And who said you might ? " He did n't answer . Surprised , she followed his look . A steward was walking up the deck , carrying a yellow radiogram . He passed them . Alan leaned back . " Are you expecting a telegram ? " she asked . " N .. no . Well , as a matter of fact , I hope to hear from . . . my relations if they 're expecting me . " " But you said they were ! " " Yes . But they do n't know exactly by which boat . " He kept his brown fine profile turned away . Then suddenly his hand was on her wrist ; but his look still averted . Her heart stopped . " Lil ? " She managed to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand over her wrist , said in that crisp quick voice that reminded her so of Mr. Denham , " Lil . . . 1 " And then , " D' you feel kind to me ? " He smiled , deliberately , looking into her eyes . She got a sense that in some idiom of his own this phrase had some meaning of its own . But it gave her , in her state of choked emotion , too tempting an occasion to say : " Ca n't you see I feel kind . . . and .. . and . " she gave in , snatching her hand from under his pressing fingers , " a bit more , " she whispered . The two women the other side of him were exchanging magazines . A steward came and took their coffee cups away . She was shivering , the yellow sunlight pouring over her . She looked and looked over the rail into the blue air with its bright-falling pattern of gulls , and was aware of his hesitation , his look turning slowly to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she heard his voice , slow and husky and hesitant : " You are a sweet ! " he said . He had n't seen her until this evening in the white dress that had no ornaments or frills or " touches " of scarlet ; and was like her conversation when she forgot that she was the " only daughter of a retired business man " who " liked to live out of town at Wimbledon . " ( He had discovered , on the second day , that she was the " Prize Ticket Girl " ; and at first this had been her charm . ) As she came down the stairway onto the main deck he guessed that , with the usual feminine sense of the connection between dress and drama , she had kept the white dress until last . ( One of Sonya 's perverse qualities was her refusal of the romantic or dramatic . Her flying maddening shadow passed between him and Lily  --  but he knew now how he would face her if she did come  --  would she come ? ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lily Bird . . . " ) He said to Lily : " How lovely you look in white . " ( And as he spoke he heard a faint far-off uncertain echo of his own voice saying , to a woman stepping into a gondola , a woman whose face was in shadow , " How lovely you look in white . " ) Lily did n't answer him . ( The woman in the gondola had n't answered him . ) But now a comment passed tluough his mind , which was , that if Lily 's dress had simplified , her expression was more complicated . At this moment , when it suited his mood to consider her most banal ; when he wanted to find her pretty , slick , coy , and in a state of slightly hysterical emotionalism , easily changed to sensuality  --  he discovered in her ( because her dress was simple and her heart-shaped face pale ? ) a touching and rather mysterious charm . They turned to go towards the bar . As they sat down at their usual little table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stool at a bar ) he said , " I suppose nothing will dissuade you from your usual tomato juice ? " She hardly seemed to be listening . Then she said , " You might dissuade me , " using his word . He ordered her a White Lady . " Very appropriate , " he said . Her half-troubled , half-smiling look was on his face . He said , wanting to reassure himself : " You 're different this evening . " " Am I ? " " Or am I just imagining it ? " He was trying to get one of her automatic pert replies . He did n't want this new grave naturalness . " I daresay you 're imagining it , " she said . There were no phrases in her stock of talk , even if she had wanted to use them , to express either to him or for herself her beautifully quickened yet unreal sense of life . She sipped her cocktail . " How d' you like it ? " he asked . " It is n't so bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thanks . " He ordered another for himself . The Maitre d'ElOtel had kept their table in the corner of the verandah grill . " What a beautiful sky , Madame , M'sieu , " he said , his round alert face and shirtfront glowing pink in its reflected radiance . " M'sicu has already ordered the champagne " ? his hand flicked toward the silver pail streaked at its curve with rose and flame . By the time they finished dinner the little lamps , switched on , made each table into a white island in the darkness . And above the steady masts and funnels the stars were out . And Lii , her hands on the lighted table , her face , lit upward , showing an intent shadowy brilliance against the dark , was talking : " My people are nothing much , " she said . " And , of course , I ought to have said so right at the start . Father 's in Benson 's , the draper store in the High Street , and mother was accountant in the butcher 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I work in Denham 's , " she went on saying . " Marx , Denham &; Klein . . .. They seem to think my work 's all right there . . . Even Mr. Denham said to me one day . . . It means more , " she said , " from Mr. Denham than from Mr. Klein ...... " My dear child , " said Alan 's voice . But she did n't hear him . She went on , " But of course it was through Mr. Klein it all came about really . . . the Competition , I mean . .. Not that I ever dreamed it could come to me getting First Prize . . . . " She told him , in full detail , even about Mum making out Shakespeare . She told it all rapidly , without a change of tone , and yet visibly on the edge of tears . And of course I ought to have confessed to you right from the start . " She glanced up . Her hands were gripped together on the square brightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You . . . knew ? " " Yes . " He got up . " Come downstairs and Iet 's dance . " She stood up , too . He put his arm through hers . " Come , my dear . " " You knew ? " He answered on the lightest possible note , " Yes and liked you for itl " It was like leading someone asleep . When they began dancing she said , " But then , Alan ( it was the first time she had used his name ) , it does n't  --  make any difference to you ? " He met her look , and then brought out his answer as quickly and crisply , " Why should it ? " " Well . . " " What an absurd idea . " She lifted her head and would have answered . But he smiled , deliberately , held her closer , and felt her senses give way to the movement , the music , the swirling crowd about them . He saw her for a moment . Shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The music changed . It was " Time on My Hands " ( their " old " tune . . . their first tune .. . that evening , five years ago , when she had said , at that fantastic Hunt Ball at Warwick , " How I like insidious little upsetting little tunes ) " ) . To-morrow , tomorrow when they arrived , he would be able to say , at last , in revenge for all the moments that Sonya had so hurt him  --  he 'd say , " Sonya , I want to introduce you to . . . " " Shall we go out on deck , " he said , still foreseeing that bitter sweet moment of revenge . ? . with Sonya . The sea was black , and the stars spiky and near . Her hand stayed on his arm . They moved up the deck . He said gently , yet without meaning it ; simply be-cause he was sorry for her , and must put off the moment of explanation : " To-morrow night , Lil , shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you going to dine with me in New York ? " ( He felt his weakness . Yet could think of no way to say now that the little " flirtation " he 'd begun was  --  over . ) " Well . . . " " Of course you are ! " ( How well he knew the cruelty of his own weakness . Hated his own moral cowardice  --  yet went on ! ) She was shivering . " You are n't cold ? " " Oh , no thanks . " When they stood still by the rail she said , " When are you coming back ? " Now  --  was the moment to say to her , " Never  --  for you , my dear . . . . " Yet he heard his own voice say fatuously enough : " Why not  --  with you ? " She did n't answer . And when he looked round it was too dark to make out her expression . Then he said , on an impulse , so touched by her and embittered by himself : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept it . " She made some sort of little exclamation . He said , " My cabin 's just here . Come and see if you like it . " ( Why take her to his cabin ? Was it , as he liked to think , to prove to her that his intentions had been " platonic " from the first ; which they had n't ? To prove , by treating her honorably now  --  that he had never meant to be anything else ? ) It was one of the deck cabins . When she hesitated he said , " Wo n't you come , Lil ? " She followed him . The steward had Ieft the light beside the bed . Alan turned to look at her . Her eyes looked black and startled ; she was breathing quickly . ( A merely physical impulse suggested to him that she was much prettier than Sonya . ) He went to a drawer and took out a small box . He came over to where she stood still by the door and handed it to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked . She flushed scarlet , let it bang , grew pale again . She held the box . " I got it for . . . for a relation whom I do n't much care about . It 's too pretty for her . If you 'd let me give it you . . . " He tried to think of these little clips , that he 'd had made specially for Sonya , as a kind of atonement  --  to Lill Her fingers mechanically pulled off the elastic band , paper , a lid . " But . . . Oh ! " she said . " I could n't take it . It 's ever so beautiful but I could n't . " The pair of little gold clips were shaped like shells . " And they lock together to make a brooch , " he said . " Please , Lil , I should like you to have them . " He put his hands on her shoulders . " But Alan .. . " " Why should n't you have them when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sultry and hesitant . After all  --  where was the harm ? He kissed her forehead . " Because . . . I do n't know ? " her whisper drifted off her lips . In spite of himself he kissed her cheek , holding her closer . He smiled , saying ( in his voice that dizzied her ) , " Because you do n't know what my . , . intentions are ? " She nodded . " Do you care ? So much ? " She shut her eyes and said with a suddenly profound and extraordinary simplicity , " I love you . " The surrender of her sense and heart and judgment were in the words that she pronounced with a strange freshness  --  a completely untarnished meaning . He let her go . " Lil , " he said . And then , " Lil , my intentions are ? " he stumbled at his own stupid phrase now , " unusually honorable . That 's why I 've dared to hold you in my arms . " He stepped back . " And now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The box fell out of her hand . The little gold shells spilled on the floor . He picked them up and then clipped them , in turn , one on each strap of her dress . Then he said , " Now go , my dear , " and opened the door and watched her as she hesitated , then turned and went out . Lit wrote : " Dearest Mum : I think I may have a great piece of news for you when I get back . . . " and then she remembered ! How silly of her ! But then she did n't know really , thinking of him all the time as she did , if she was standing on her head or her heels . She took up the piece of notepaper and tore it across , and dropped it into the wastepaper basket . Better anyway to break it to them herself . Besides , it 'd all be fixed up and more definite by then . Because of course he had n't " spoken " in so many words yet . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honorable , " in his voice that hesitated and thrilled her so queerly and terribly . She touched the little gold shells clipped to her wrapper , and the sweet and disturbing remembrance of last night ( of his touch as he let her hand go , of his look , as he opened the door for her ) oppressed her senses . She got up and began to pack . Even if they only docked at three , she decided , she would get her packing done before the heat of the day . And besides , although he had n't actually said anything last night , he 'd be expecting her on deck about twelve . She did n't see him on deck until nearly one . And when she did and he sat down in the chair beside hers , he was sort of queer and pale and restless and said he 'd had a swim , and that he 'd looked for her everywhere , and it felt like thunder . But when nearly everyone had gone down to lunch and they got up to go too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " I thought so much about you last night . " And when he said this the frightened feeling left her , and she felt sort of shaky and warm and as if she was going to cry ; but only for happiness . But he went on , " Lil . . . dear . . . we 've got to have a talk . . " But he broke off , saying , " Perhaps  --  after luncheon . " And they went downstairs , and she took his hand and said , " You must n't let yourself get worried about things , dear . It 's all going to be wonderful ! It is really . " And there was such a sweet comforting tone in her voice ( the tone in her mother 's voice that had first comforted Mr. Bird , her father , twenty years before ) that Alan turned to look at her . And meeting her look that startled him by a grave and high and beautiful quality of its own , he stopped short , and then broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Lill " again  --  suddenly so speechlessly sorry for her , and so bitter with himself that he could have burst into tears . And then he seized her hand and kissed it and , without another look , turned and ran upstairs instead of going into the dining room for lunch . . Men did act queer , she thought , puzzled , yet more flattered and touched than anxious . And it was n't until they were docking that she saw him across the great piles of luggage on the dock and called out , " See you later , " leaving it to him to make their arrangements to meet this evening . ( The Welham Hotel she was to go to . But she 'd tell him that when she saw him . He looked sort of flustered about his luggage , and it did n't do to interfere with any man when he was bothered . ) He called back , " See you on the dock , " and turned away to say something to a steward near him . Someone near her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the view of New York , and she looked at it again . But its high blocks and towers , steel-colored and misty in the heat of the afternoon , seemed only dimly " wonderful " compared to her sense and view of her own future . She went down to her cabin and shut the valise that she was taking on shore , and explained to the stewardess that she was making the return trip . And then remembered that she had told her this already . When she got up on deck again the with a Customs man about a half opened ship was alongside the quay and a crowd crate of wine . of faces were looking up . But when he started again , " Lil ... I Suddenly Alan was beside her and his must just say something ? " she cut him arm was in hers . He said : short , almost laughing at him , saying , " Come with me . . . I . . . want to " Look here , dear  --  we 'll be seeing each say something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and taking on a proprietary thing to you . Lil my dear . " tone she sent him ( it was the first time She said , " Whatever ! Ca n't it wait ? " she had ever " told " him to do anything ) She was too excited to notice his tone . over to F to see how his own baggage was Funny men were ! coming along . . . . And her look folWhen they had pushed through the lowed him with affection  --  and then with crowd on deck she followed him down the a renewed stab of wonder that he should gangplank . He said three times over belong to her . that his luggage would be under F , holding her arm tight but not looking at Alan was saying to the Customs officer , her . " Yes , those three are mine , " when he She said , " Then mine'l/ be under B. " turned round and saw Sonya . And he repeated , " Yes . You 'll be under As he saw her he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sickening sweet shock of the familiar that the coming and going of people and only she could give him ; and saw that she stewards and luggage for a porter . She was new again ; and felt his heart beat too said : quickly again ... and his sense of life , " It seems to me the best is to go and of living , of delight awaken again . . . . wait for our luggage as everybody else is When he spoke it was her name . doing .
