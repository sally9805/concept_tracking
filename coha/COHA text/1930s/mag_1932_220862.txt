School children whose teachers and parents berate them for saying . " It is me , " " I wish I was there , " and many another casual solecism , could take heart last week . Approved as good colloquial usage were 230 such commonplace errors , in a survey published by the National Council of Teachers of English . Representing 6,000 elementary , high school and college teachers , the National Council can not enforce its edicts , but by its 21-year-old authority , its surveys and discussions , it has much influence in textbook-making , curriculum-drafting and teaching . For its study of English usage the National Council got 229 judges-authors , linguists , editors , businessmen , teachers . Both studies tended away from " an impossible literary standard ' ' and towards " the habits of better middle class speech .

S. teachers as permissible : Who are you looking for ? Invite whoever you wish . None are expected . Everyone was here but they all went home early . Healthy climate . Pretty good , awfully bad . I felt badly . Walk slow . Try and get well . He invited my friends and myself . Farther for further , shall for will . The reason was because . . .
