Lucky Sapphire Birthday Brooches . . . . <P> To satisfy their need for these and other human necessities people trooped last week into 2,747 F. W. Woolworth stores in Canada ( 143 ) , England ( 677 ) , Germany ( 82 ) and the U. S. and Cuba ( 1,845 ) . Yet if the phrase " five &; ten " still trips off many a buyer 's tongue , the " five &; ten " has nonetheless joined the buggy and the speakeasy in the outdated past . From 1879 to 1932 Woolworth sold no single item for more than ten cents . Since 1932 WToolworth 's U. S. , Canadian and Cuban stores have sold items priced up to 20 , since 1935 up to 40 , since last year up to $1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woolworth prices . These were milestones in F. W. Woolworth Co. ' s career . Another came last week when for the first time since 1911 the company sold securities for new capital . <P> It never thought of doing so in 1923 when its earnings reached the giddy peak of $31.84 a share , nor in 1927 when its profits on 1,581 U. S. and Canadian stores averaged $16,805 per store . But when profits per store began to drop in 1928 and Depression accentuated the skid , Woolworth contemplated changes . By 1932 when profits per store were down to $8,093 , Woolworth 's moved towards higher prices to compete with rival chains which offered a line of merchandise broader in price and quality . This year with profits per store down to $9,580 ( 1936 ) , * it made another decision . <P> To counteract the downward trend of per store profits and to make room for the new goods brought in by higher prices , Woolworth has long contemplated a wholesale modernization of its stores . Last week it announced that it would start at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( rumor said to a large life insurance company ) $10,000,000 in ten-year , 3% debentures . To start , the famed Woolworth Store No. 1,000 , on Fifth Avenue at 40th Street , Manhattan will be abandoned in favor of a 5-story , air-conditioned , granite and steel store now abuilding on Fifth Avenue at 39th Street . Ranking with the abandonment of price limit and the borrowing of new capital as a sign of the times , is the fact that this new store will not have even the famed red-banded front . <P> *Profits per store rose momentarily to $10,700 in 1934 , have fallen steadily since .
