txt The New York County Lawyers Association is on record today as opposed to President Roosevelt 's proposal to reorganize the personnel of the United States Judiciary , adopting a resolution condemning the program after a stirring debate and by the relatively close vote of 358 to 265 last night . Introduced by Judge Samuel Sea-bury , chairman of a special committee of the association , the resolutior says , in part , that the " New York County Lawyers Association is opposed to the enactment of the bit . . , which , if enacted , will impair the independence of the federa courts . " " Be it further resolved , " it con , tinues , " that the enactment of such a bill would furnish a dangerow precedent . . . for ignoring the fundamental principle of Americar government , namely , that the courts and particularly the federal courts which determine controversies between the Government and its citizens , shall not in their administration of Justice be-subject to the will of the Executive or of the Congress . ' Charles E. Hughes Jr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , is president of the association , but did not preside at the meeting , " for delicate reasons . " His place was ' tilled by Charles J. Shearn , first vice-president . ? The vote was taken after a two-hour v debate which attracted an attendance of 600 members . Interest in the discussion reached such a high pitch that the main hall of the association 's headquarters overflowed and amplifiers had to be set up in the corridors outside . Prior to the debate , the resolution was adopted by the association 's board of directors by a vote of 20 to 1 . In the case of the special committee under Judge Seabury , which included Thomas D. Thacher , formerly United States Solicitor-General , a dissenting voice came from S. John Block , frequently a Socialist candidate for judicial office here . Six speakers arrayed themselves upon each side of the question , and although ' the discussion began quietly , the debate had not progressed far before there was a show of feeling . Hisses and outcries marked the discussion at intervals .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
