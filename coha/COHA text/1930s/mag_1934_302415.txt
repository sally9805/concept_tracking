Two Sundays ago in Seattle 's solid old Pilgrim Congregational Church , Rev. Frederic William Shorter mounted his pulpit , looked squarely at his congregation of 400 , said briskly : " Yes , I preach revolution . Next Sunday , if I am still pastor , I will preach on ' The Insanity of Jesus . ' It always has been insanity to preach the brotherhood of man . " <P> Last Sunday Preacher Shorter no longer was pastor of Pilgrim Church . The congregation which called him there eight years ago , chiefly at the behest of President Alfred Helmer Lundin of Seattle 's Chamber of Commerce , had voted him out . Chief reason was that " Fred " Shorter , 39 , Australian-born graduate of Missouri State University and Yale Divinity School , had . like many another thoughtful U. S. minister , turned Socialist . He believed that " Christianity and Capitalism as they now exist are not compatible " ; that Christianity itself is " historic Communism . " a peaceful force to transform the social order . Pastor Shorter promoted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Socialist Party last year , gathered about him earnest young radicals who maintained the congregation 's size as the older conservatives dropped away . <P> Last week conservatives found an issue on which to battle their pastor to a finish . In Pilgrim Church 's study room , given four years ago by Founder-Board Chairman Elbridge Amos Stuart of Carnation Co. ( milk products ) , there had appeared seven murals done by a young people 's art class under the supervision of Ross Gill . Subjects of the murals : <P> 1 ) St. Swastika , a Jew nailed to a hooked cross , with Hitler and troops driving out other Jews ; 2 ) a Negro mother being rewarded for her fecundity by a planter , while a lynching takes place in the background ; 3 ) a Christian missionary converting Chinese coolies for Capitalist exploitation ; 4 ) a starving family on the steps of their shanty with battleships , dirigibles , armaments in the background ; 5 ) a college cheerleader , typifying " subverted individualism " ; 6 ) capitalists gambling with death-headed munitions makers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( an Orthodox Russian priest giving blessing under the old regime ) , Fields That Are Blest ( a modern Russian farm ) , Fields That Are Too Blest ( a U. S. farmer plowing under crops ) . <P> Stoutly defended by Socialist Shorter , these murals brought 298 members of Pilgrim Church together one night last week . The pastor 's supporters noted many a one who had not entered the church in years . When a vote was taken it was 177 to oust , 121 to retain . <P> Said Socialist Shorter : " It 's a white elephant off my hands . " ( The church was $12,000 in debt , the pastor 's salary $1,500 in arrears . ) He promptly announced a new Non-Denominational Church of the People , a " rigorous , radical , revolutionary church " with no symbolism , no magical elements , no hymning the " Blood of the Lamb . " All classes and all races might come to learn of the social teachings of Jesus . For the first day of the new church , last Sunday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning , the University of Seattle Y.M. C. A. at noon , the " Skidroad , " ( Seattle 's Bowery ) in the afternoon .
