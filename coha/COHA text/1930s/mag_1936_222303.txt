No churchgoer was the late Frederick Gilmer Bonfils , blatant publisher of the Denver Post . To him , Catholicism was occasional newspaper material . To his Catholic Wife Belle and his Catholic Daughter May , however , the solace of the Mass was real . Last week Daughter May ( Mrs. Clyde Berryman ) gave $150,000 to the diocese of Denver to enlarge and rebuild a Franciscan monastery . <P> Mrs. Berryman , a matronly blonde who has been estranged from her smart sister Helen because of a court battle over their mother 's estate , is famed in Denver for her gaudy back yard in which the trees are painted white . Simple and austere , however , are the plans by which able Architect Jules Jacques Benous Benedict will transform the exterior of existing red brick Franciscan buildings into Lombard Romanesque , outfit the interiors with a new altar , mosaic and murals , library , dining hall and study rooms for 20 brown-robed monks . Those monks will call their habitation Bonfils Memorial Monastery .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
