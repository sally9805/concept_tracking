Indubitable dinosaur , Atlantosaurus , hall ! <P> Thou , gecko aggrandized into a quadrupedal whale ; <P> I marvel at thy magnitude , I wonder at thy weight , <P> I bow me down before thee , thou organic ultimate ! <P> Big , bulky Brobdingnaggian beast ! Exceeding in thy size <P> All living things upon the land e'er seen by hitman eyes ! - <P> Illimitable lizard , incommensurable newt , <P> Interminable tadpole , inexsuperable brute ! . . . <P> The creature thus celebrated was a 60-ft. plant-feeding dinosaur , tentatively named Atlantosaurus montanus , discovered in Colorado . The verses were composed by an author-traveler named Frank Cowan of Greensburg , Pa. , published in Vol . III , No. 1 , of Ward 's Natural Science Bulletin , dated Jan. 1 , 1884 . The same issue contained a sketch of a brontosaurus , a facetiously polysyllabic and mildly risque poem about a mermaid and an octopus , articles on the musk ox and the flying fox of Australia ; also included was a business-like list of catalogs for the sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American bird eggs , glass models of invertebrates . This periodical , published by Ward 's Natural Science Establishment of Rochester , N. Y. was probably the earliest scientific " house organ " in the U. S. <P> Last week Ward 's shipped a big consignment ( value undisclosed ) of rocks , fossils , insects , snake skulls , animal and human skeletons to the Exposition Nacional de 1936 at Barranquilla , Colombia . Last week also , with hundreds of small orders for fossils and other material coming in from school children the world over , Ward 's officials were basking in the knowledge that the establishment would show a year-end profit for the first time in its 74-year history . University of Rochester alumni were apprised of the present doings of Ward 's in the current issue of the Rochester Alumni Review . <P> Henry Augustus Ward was a zestful young scholar who studied at Williams and under the late great Jean Louis Rodolphe Agassiz , at Cambridge . He later attended the School of Mines at the University of Paris , paying his expenses by collecting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he became a professor of natural science at the University of Rochester . He assembled a group of skilled preparators which , at one time or another , included Carl Akeley , Charles Livingston Bull , William T. Hornaday , Frederic Lucas . He sold a $20,000 collection of fossils to the university , but went ahead with his mail-order business on a high scientific plane . He was killed by an automobile in 1906.
