Since the days when its left-handed Lew Tendler used to fight Lightweight Champion Benny Leonard so regularly that the names of the two fighters sounded like the title of a corporation , Philadelphia has always had at least one first-rate functioning fighter of one sort or another . Tendler , now a 180-lb. restaurateur , is the manager of Philadelphia 's latest pugilistic hope , a large blond Italian named Al Ettore . Without fighting much outside his home town , Ettore had by last summer managed to get enough local following to justify a bout with famed Joe Louis , who is trying to rebuild the reputation as a superfighter that was destroyed by Max Schmeling last June . Last week , 24 hours before the tenth anniversary of the rainy night that Gene Tunney beat Jack Dempsey there for the championship of the world , Ettore and Louis crawled into a ring in the Municipal Stadium . The fight , which drew a crowd of 50,000 , lasted five lively rounds . In the first , two rights put Ettore down for a short count . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised to knock Louis into the 15th row , courageously belabored his opponent 's ribs , caused the expression of pained bewilderment that Louis wore throughout the Schmeling fight to cross his face again . In the fourth , a Louis right produced another knockdown . Still dizzy , Ettore went down again in the fifth . When the referee counted him out , Manager Tendler helped him to his corner . <P> Chief significance of Louis ' victory was that it added weight to arguments in favor of a bout between Louis and Champion Jim Braddock before the latter fights Max Schmeling next June . Braddock 's contract with Madison Square Garden prohibits his defending his title before the Schmeling fight . Last week , Philadelphia 's Promoter Herman Taylor explored a loophole in the agreement by offering Braddock a fat sum to fight for a no-decision fight with Louis-i. e. , a fight in which Braddock 's title would not be at stake . Madison Square Garden promptly protested that the champion had no right so to endanger his prestige .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
