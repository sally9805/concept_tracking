BRYNHILD OR THE SHOW OF THINGS- H. , G. Wells-Scribner ( $2.50 ) . <P> H. G. Wells is a spark plug . That he has had only a loose connection with the rest of the machine that makes the world 's wheels go round is perhaps a pity , perhaps a good thing . If he had fitted perfectly into his social socket the sparks he has emitted for 40 years might well have been neither so noticeable nor so illuminating . On the other hand , Britain 's cylinder might have sputtered a little less had Author Wells been firmly pressed into the national service . Pity or not , at 70* H. G. Wells remains what he has always been-a cheerful chider of human shortcomings , with one exuberant eye cocked on his fellow Englishmen . Last week he made headlines with his latest proposals to reform education ( see p. 44 ) . And last week he published his 76th book . <P> Optimistic , like nearly all of H. G. Wells 's books , Brynhild or The Show of Things also encouraged Wellsians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's disintegration and an honest woman 's fulfillment , it is also a Wellsian fable , told without his usual blackboard charts and magic-lantern slides , of the human search for reality . <P> Rowland Palace was an author who had polish and irony-and a young wife with an eye that pierced pretense . An unflattering news picture of himself set Palace pondering nervously on what people really thought about him . His considered conclusion : that every public figure should create or control the effigy of himself he showed to the world . Because he felt that Brynhild , his wife , might take a less than sympathetic view , he planned his ensuing publicity campaign in secret , with such conscience-bolstering sentiments as : " No human beings have ever really seen themselves . . . . They pose and act . They tell stories about themselves to other people . Life is a battle of make-believe , a universal bluff . " Quietly , cleverly Palace set about getting a publicity man . Before long he realized that he had whistled up the devil , but by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brynhild in her quiet way had fallen in love with another man , had a child by him , resigned herself to living the rest of her life with her slightly despicable , quite likable and altogether transparent husband . <P> Wellsians have frequently exclaimed that the world lost a satirist when Author Wells turned popular pamphleteer . In Brynhild he gives them further matter for exclamation , in such thumbnail flicks as these : " His normal expression was one of patient self-confidence , varied by lapses into great mobility when he was exercised by a business suggestion or anxious to be effective . Then he gesticulated , brought his face nearer to his interlocutor and spat slightly as he became emphatic . Finally he would wipe himself up so to speak and become suddenly immobile again , with his face interrogative and a little askew . " . . . " No one could be so learned and wise and clever as Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler is certified to be by practically all the universities in the world . It 's too much . " And he can still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life : " Dusty grayish events with a lot of rather forced laughter and streaks of downright painful and disagreeable experiences . Uncalled for inflictions . And a perpetual menace . "
