Angel ( Paramount ) concerns Lady Maria 's ( Marlene Dietrich ) rather pathetic effort to cast off her loyalty to her diplomat husband , Sir Frederick ( Herbert Marshall ) . Angel is not a slut but a wife whose fidelity has been overstrained by Sir Frederick 's immersion in diplomacy . And he , for all his fine deliberate charm , is the type of fellow who. when his wife tells him that she has been dreaming , immediately asks : " Of me ? " <P> Lady Maria has already had a bit of a Paris fling with one Anthony Horton ( Melvyn Douglas ) . With some help from coincidence , Sir Frederick meets Anthony , finds they are Wartime buddies , and invites him over to the manse . Lady Maria is still disposed toward fidelity when Sir Frederick decides to go to Geneva alone instead of second-honeymooning with her to Vienna . Slighted , she grants Anthony 's plea for a meeting at their Paris rendezvous . Here Sir Frederick , having put two and two together , arrives in time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else is Anthony 's mistress . <P> Angel is the first picture made by Ernst Lubitsch since he stopped being Paramount 's production boss and went back to directing . It is the kind of picture in which the characters move about in carefully articulated poses , in costly sets , talking about their emotions and playing well-bred tunes on the piano . Marlene Dietrich flutters her eyelashes twice before each line about love and once when her feeling is marital fidelity . Her make-up is so sharpened it makes her look gaunt , but nothing can keep her from looking lovely , and she can still be beautiful in clothes nobody else would dare to wear . <P> In spite of its nonsensical , stilted story and some bad dialogue Angel has a sustained romantic mood , a subdued , shimmering elegance of playing and direction that makes it interesting though silly . Typical line : " Please go . Every moment that you 're here my home is in danger . " <P> Conquest ( Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ) . For several years Greta Garbo has been toying with the notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Napoleon Bonaparte and Marie Countess Walewska of Poland . The notion was in the Hollywood tradition , for most producers like royal historical episodes for an important star . They give the star dignity . If dignity is its purpose , Conquest admirably succeeds . It moves with the fateful and august tread of history itself . Its huge , expensive panorama ( running time : 2 hours , cost : $2,000,000 ) embraces a quarter of a century and three-quarters of Europe , with the detailed perfection of one of Meissonier 's Napoleonic battle-scenes . Aside from being a little dull , the picture has only one major fault . Apparently Producer Bernard Hyman overlooked the fact that if one of the characters in any dramatic piece is Napoleon Bonaparte , and if this character is played up to the hilt by a competent actor , everyone else in the cast is subsidiary . <P> Hence , although she is nominally costarred , Garbo appears for the first time in 15 years in a supporting role . The real star of the picture is Charles Boyer as Napoleon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
