txt The farm equipment industry is still operating in red figures and will , in all probability , end the year that way , although it is now living within its cash intake with what is normally the best collection period yet to come . Dry weather in June knocked the bottom out of hopes for a profitable year in 1933 so far as the American market goes . Experts in the trade estimate that failure of crops in pivotal areas has set back farm machinery earnings an entire year . Sales for the first six months were at least 25% wider last year 's unprofitable levels , and present indications are that the group will do well to sell as much merchandise in the last six months of 1933 as It did in the like period a year ago when volume fell to disappointing proportions . Harvester 's Sales Below 1932 FL-et quarter sales of the industry 's leader , International Harvester Co .. are pretty well tutder the first three months Of 1932 .

Consequently , those companies which rely exclusively on rural buying have found little to encourage them so far as 1933 profits are concerned . With inventories still ' adequate and demand dull , factorieS and sales divisions have also been quiet for Deere &; Co. , J. L Case Co. , Oliver Farm Equipment Co. , Minneapolis Moline Power Implement Co. and the farm machinery divisions of Allis-Chalmers Mfg . Co. and Caterpillar Tractor Co . There has been , nevertheless , some improvement in the industry , particularly so far as cash and collections are concerned . Liquidity remains the touchstone of the farm machine industry this year . Collections have been better than a year ago in most instances and , curiously enough , in most sections of the country . This factor , together with curtailed expenses and a tendency to secure larger down payments , has allowed the group as a whole to live within its cash intake . The heavy collection period is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry will close the year in better cash position . Deere , Oliver and Minneapolis-Moline are expected to reduce their bank loans which , as of the last fiscal year-end , were $3,900,000 , $9,850,000 and $1 , - 500,000 respectively . Harvester , with cash and U. S. short-term notes exceeding $53,000,000 , had no interest in bank loans . J. L Case closed 1932 with cash of $720,880 but with no borrowings from the banks . Outlook for Soviet Orders The likelihood of reduced bank obligations this year does not take into consideration the happy emergency of having to step up production to a point where bank borrowing would become necessary . Right now , however , such contingency does not appear likely unless , of course , the increasingly favorable relationship between this country and the Soviet should result in the placing of substantial orders for farm machinery before the next year-end . The Russian market is , there  --  never has that been questioned . From a mechanical point of view at least , American-made tractors have been very popular in Russia . But three factors have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . The first and most compelling reason has been a lack of ready cash . The second has been a striving toward what the Soviet considered more adequate credit teems . And the third is an intense desire to be recognized by the American republic . Russia 's great need for additional farm machinery , therefore , has been held up . Stalingrad and other U. S. S. R. plants have been able to supply only a portion of the demand . The Soviet 's credit etaitding in this country remains in first-class shape . At least two of the companies which have shipped large gleantitles of tractors and other machinery to the Communists in recent years have already received full payment and all other commitments have been met on schedule . So , It all these difficulties can be ironed out , Russia would loom as the industry 's " ace in the hole " for a quick return to prosperity . Possibility of a bonanza in the form of Busaims orders is made more pointed by the industry 's demonstrated ability to make a quick return to profitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is why , from a stock market point ' of view , farm equipment shares have been coming in for considerable attention and prices have experienced sharp surges upward in the past few months .
