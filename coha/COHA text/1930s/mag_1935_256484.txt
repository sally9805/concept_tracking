Last week , following the death of President-Editor John Sanford ( " Jack " ) Cohen ( TIME , May 27 ) , the brisk , breezy Atlanta Journal ( " Covers Dixie Like the Dew " - with 86,600 circulation ) was formally taken in charge by the family which has really owned it for the last 40 years-the House of Gray . The late lawyer-politician James Richard ( " Jim " ) Gray , who married Mary Inman of the rich , aristocratic Inman clan , acquired the Journal in 1896 from Hoke Smith , twice Governor of Georgia , twice U. S. Senator , Secretary of the Interior under Cleveland . When President Gray died in 1917 John Cohen , a Journal newshawk since 1890 , was put into the front office as active head of the paper but Widow Gray , as majority stockholder , remained chairman of the board and her two sons sat with her . <P> The dual position held by John Cohen was split last week . To Son Inman Gray , 49 , went the presidency ; to Son James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up through the engraving department to one vice presidency . James Richard got his start in the circulation department , served as assistant general manager , vice president . Both men attended University of Georgia where they were aristocratic Chi Phi 's . Both were brought up in a professional tradition which demands despisal of Clark Howell and his stodgy old Constitution ( circulation : 99,000 ) and , of late years , hatred of Georgia 's Governor Eugene Talmadge . Editor James , short , pudgy , bulbous-jawed , is as much of a cameraphobe as President Inman who last week suppressed all available newspictures of himself and brother . <P> For years the Howells and the Grays have battled fiercely . In 1924 Editor Cohen marched boldly into a Klan-dominated State Democratic Convention , marched out with Publisher Howell 's job as national committeeman . The election of Howell-backed Talmadge to the governorship forced the Journal into a political back seat , widened the No Man 's Land between the publishers . So savagely did the Journal attack Governor Talmadge last summer that that " cracker " politician angrily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " * urged his supporters to cancel their Journal subscriptions , switch to the Constitution . Crowning outrage to the Grays last week was Governor Talmadge 's rude seizure of the Democratic National Committeemanship left vacant by Editor Cohen 's death . <P> Governor Talmadge has only one thing that might interest the Grays-the power to end the life imprisonment of Richard Gray Gallogly , whose mother Frances is a sister of the Brothers Inman and James Richard Jr. + In 1928 , while a student at Oglethorpe , drunken Richard Gray Gallogly held up an Atlanta drugstore , killed the cashier , shot out the face of an Oglethorpe campus clock . The Grays never refer to their black sheep but no wise Atlantan thought for a minute last week that they would ever trade political peace for family whitewash . <P> - ? - <P> *Descended from a Jewish family resident in the South since before the Revolution , Editor Cohen and his family long were members of Atlanta 's North Avenue Presbyterian Church . <P> +Divorced from Arthur J. Gallogly , she is now married to Dr. Worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
