Forty-three sturdy little sailboats stood out of Newport , R. I. last week , headed southeast across 635 miles of open sea for Bermuda . The biggest fleet ever entering an ocean race , the 43 sloops , schooners , yawls , ketches included many a new craft , many a famed oldtimer . Newest was Robert P. Baruch 's 53-ft. sloop Kirawan , launched only a month ago . Most famed was Vadim Makaroff 's 72-ft. adapted-ketch Vamarie , known to yachtsmen as " often a bridesmaid but never a bride , " because she so frequently crosses the finish line first only to lose the race because of her small allowance handicap . Last week 's finish proved no exception . First over the horizon at St. David 's Head , Vamarie crossed the line four minutes ahead of the schooner Brilliant . When the race was over , however , neither had won , for brand new Kirawan , finishing third , beat them both by her 13-hr. time allowance . Time of the winner was 4 days , 20 hr. , very slow because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleet in the Gulf Stream , made the race the roughest in 13 years , forced six yachts to scuttle back to the U. S. with split sails , broken rigging . <P> As navigator aboard Brilliant last week was 45-year-old Alfred Fullerton Loomis , one of the most experienced ocean racers in the world . On a submarine-chaser during the War , Sailor Loomis has spent most of the years since then scudding about the world in small sailboats . A veteran of one transatlantic , two Fastnet , four Bermuda races , he is an accepted authority on small-boat sailing , the author of severa topnotch nautical books . Last week , as he stood on Brilliant 's deck watching victory slip from his grasp , there was published in Manhattan another top-notch Loomis book , Ocean Racing , * the first thoroughgoing history of this hazardous sport of rich men . <P> In 1866 , four wealthy New Yorkers got into an argument over which had the finest yacht . Upshot was the first ocean race , across the Atlantic from Sandy Hook to the Isle of Wight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vesta , James Gordon Bennett Jr . ' s 107-ft . Henrietta and the 106-ft . Fleetwing of George &; Franklin Osgood . Choosing December as the windiest month , these three schooners set off with professional crews , many a misgiving in a rising wind . Vesta and Henrietta had their cockpits boarded over but not Fleetwing . On the eighth day , wallowing through a heavy gale at night , Fleetwing shipped a sea which carried eight men overboard . Two were swept back by the next comber , but the rest were lost . Despite this tragedy , Fleetwing finished second , 40 minutes ahead of Vesta and only eight hours behind Henrietta , winner in 13 days , 21 hr. , 45 min . <P> Four years later came the next ocean race , with the 108-ft . English schooner Cambria beating the U. S. schooner Dauntless from Ireland to Sandy Hook by only 1 hr. , 43 min . Two Dauntless seamen were lost .
