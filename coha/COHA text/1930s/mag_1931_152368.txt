Russian expatriates in Manhattan last week used Religion to plague Art for the sake of Politics . The excuse was an exhibition of Russian Orthodox icons loaned to the Metropolitan Museum of Art by the Soviet Government through the American Russian Institute . Boston 's Museum of Fine Arts had previously shown the icons , and European cities had shown them before Boston , with nothing more than perfunctory heckling by expatriate Russians . But Manhattan serves as a loudspeaker to the world . <P> The Archdiocese Council of the Russian Church protested : " A gross outrage of religious feelings of tens of thousands of American citizens who are faithful sons of the Russian Orthodox Church in North America . " <P> The National League of Americans of Russian Origin , Inc. , demanded of the Metropolitan Museum : " Do you realize with whom you are trafficking when borrowing the Russian icons from what some people choose to call the Soviet Government ? Can you fully grasp the measure of indignation which policies of this sort arouse in the minds of right-thinking Russians ? . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Making much ado about the irreverence of the icon display , despite the fact that the Museum has long shown venerable objects of Roman Catholic , Buddhist and other religions , some Museum members resigned . <P> Nonetheless the Museum opened the icon exhibit to the public , explaining that these icons had long stood in Russian art museums , were not stolen , represented a form of art little known in the U. S.
