The Committee of Thirteen of the League of Nations is the same thing as the Council of the League of Nations without Italy . Last week the League delegates from Argentina , Australia , Chile , Denmark , Ecuador , France , Great Britain . Poland , Portugal , Rumania , Russia , Spain and Turkey hitched themselves up to a green baize battle between handsome , toothy Anthony Eden of Great Britain and bald , moose-tall Pierre Etienne Flandin of France . <P> On Britain 's insistence the meeting was called to discuss once more Italy 's invasion of Ethiopia , to demand either immediate cessation of hostilities or stiffer Sanctions in retaliation for Italy 's use of poison gas . <P> France wanted no part in this League crackdown . Italy 's possible threat to Britain and the headwaters of the Nile was none of her business . Foreign Minister Flandin had only the Rhine on his mind . Urgently he needed Italy 's help against the threat of Nazi domination in Europe . Before leaving for Geneva he had given the Sarraut Cabinet France 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIME , April 13 ) . Insisting on 25 years of status quo , a definite promise from Germany not to fortify the Rhineland and an international police force to keep the peace , the Flandin Plan was taken no more seriously in Geneva than it was elsewhere in Europe . <P> In Rome Benito Mussolini felt that the time was ripe to do a little crowing . The Ethiopian War was going the way it should have gone six months ago . The Imperial Guard of Haile Selassie was smashed . The Negus himself was supposed to be hiding , beardless in the bushes . With a little luck Italian troops should reach Dessye by Easter . Then II Duce could demand peace on his own terms . To the Fascist Grand Council last week he roared : <P> " The superb victories of our soldiers bring Italy within reach of her first objective , security for our colonies . Such security will be achieved in full with the complete annihilation of the Ethiopian military formations-an annihilation which is bound to come soon . . . . The preparation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air will proceed with even quicker rhythm . " <P> Going to Geneva as an " observer , " Italy 's Baron Pompeo Aloisi was no less cocky . To the Committee of Thirteen 's Chairman Don Salvador de Madariaga of Spain , he snapped : " I have not come here to talk peace . I have come to attend a meeting of the Locarno Powers . " <P> To Eden of Britain , Flandin of France , van Zeeland of Belgium , Baron Aloisi sent an embarrassing message : <P> " My Government wants to know from each of you whether the presence of Italy is desired here and whether her collaboration in the work of European reconstruction is wanted . " <P> It was now up to Foreign Secretary Eden to state his case . The use of poison gas against the Ethiopians was the point at issue , and he had eight specific instances of it between Dec. 30 , and mid-March . The Suez Canal Co. reported that over 250 tons of Italian poison gas had passed the canal in the last four months . Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil embargo , was the Eden ultimatum.
