HOT WATER - P. G. Wodehouse - Doubleday , Doran . Like Amos ' n ' Andy , Charles Dickens and other classics , Author Pelham Grenville Wodehouse some time ago began to pay the penalty of fame . His patter still amuses but its pattern is growing a thought too familiar . Not that Author Wodehouse never uncorks anything new . Hot Water , his latest offering , shows him a keen student of U. S. vaudeville gags , funny sheets , Walter-Winchellisms . It is a tribute to his skill as a merciless horser of musi-comedy scenes , dialog and situation that he is still able to raise many a horse laugh . Packy , U. S. Adonis , ex-Yale footballer and recent millionaire , has bitten off more than he really wants to chew in getting engaged to a beautiful English bluestocking . Fat , henpecked Mr. Gedge is in an even tougher spot , living in enforced exile from his beloved California , his Shriner tendencies sternly held in check by a wife who intends to make him U. S. Ambassador to France . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrible temper , who unluckily sent Mrs. Gedge a letter intended for his bootlegger , is to be the blunt , blackmailed instrument of Mrs. Gedge 's scheme . " Soup " Slattery , hot on the trail of the Gedge jewels ; Jane Opal , who thinks she wants an intellectual beau but really fell for Packy when she saw him play for Yale ; the Vicomte de Blissac , continuous sufferer from a most unGallic thirst ; all these and others converge into a crowded mesh of funny complications which add up to a standard Wodehouse farce .
