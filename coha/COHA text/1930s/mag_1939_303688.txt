Five years ago Earl J. Jones , a drum-chested , muscular , aggressive man , turned up in Zanesville , Ohio. * Without much visible financial backing , he went into the coal-mining business , presently owned several mines , including one of the most modern , all-mechanical excavations in the U. S. To transport his coal along the Muskingum River he bought a barge company . <P> There were some bad accidents in the mines , and Earl Jones did not like the way the Zanesville morning Times-Recorder and evening Signal ( both owned by Father William Oliver , Sons Orville Beck and Henry Clay Littick ) reported what happened . Nor did he like it when the Litticks played up several suits against him-one for damage allegedly done by his mine wastes to adjoining lands . <P> One day last August Earl Jones made up his mind to start a newspaper of his own . He set wreckers to work tearing down a three-story apartment house one block off Zanesville 's main street . When he learned that the job would take two weeks , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the building overnight . Then , under floodlights , working night &; day , his men started putting up a new $75,000 brick , steel and concrete newspaper plant . <P> This week , just 59 days after his men went to work , Earl Jones had his first ( Sunday ) edition on the street . It was a good , thick paper ( four sections , 48 pages ) , with plenty of color comics , plenty of advertising , plenty of local news on Page 1 . The Zanesville News plant was modern and complete , cost $250,000 . With latest photographic and engraving equipment and brand-new unit tubular twin-12 presses , it was capable of printing the News in color throughout . Trucks were ready to deliver it daily and Sunday to every home in Muskingum County . And thorough Earl Jones was prepared to spend money to put it over . <P> Before the News Building was up , the fight began . The Littick family did not plan to let their Zanesville newspaper monopoly go without a struggle . Publisher of the News is Clark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eagle-Gazette in 1936 , was coaxed back to work by Earl Jones . Clark Beach had signed a contract form with a United Pressagent , given him a check for several weeks ' service in advance . But the contract was still to be accepted by U. P. 's Manhattan office when the Litticks stepped in and bought U. P. service for themselves . <P> Then Clark Beach went to International News Service and found the Litticks had signed for that too . Said I. N. S. : " We prefer to deal with well-established papers . " They had given the Litticks an exclusive contract , and since the Littick papers already held an Associated Press franchise , the News was left without any major wire service .
