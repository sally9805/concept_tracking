World War I was hardly three weeks old when one William Ewert Berry , publisher of a modest group of British journals , came out with a weekly picture magazine : War Illustrated . Before the War ended and the Illustrated died , it had a circulation of 750,000 ( record for its day ) made Berry rich and helped earn him a knighthood . Editor was husky 43-year-old John Hammerton . <P> Last week World War II found War Illustrated back on the streets of London after a lapse of 20 years . Publisher was William Ewert Berry , now Lord Camrose , proprietor of a mammoth chain of newspapers ( including the Daily Telegraph ) , and one of Britain 's fabulous press peers. + Its editor was 68-year-old Sir John Hammerton ( knighted in 1932 ) , greyhaired but husky as ever . <P> Lord Camrose made up his mind to revive the Illustrated two days before war was declared , first copies reached the newsstands eight days after . Before the week was half gone , the original print order ( 500,000 copies ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1914 is the technical brilliance of war pictures in the new Illustrated . Its 32 pages show British anti-aircraft guns and planes waiting for German raiders , Britons scurrying into air-raid shelters , their children evacuating London while German armies overrun Poland . Most of Sir John Hammerton 's scenes of actual war in progress came to him from the enemy 's Ministry for Propaganda , by way of the neutral Netherlands and Scandinavia . He had no immediate plans for sending his own cameramen to the front . <P> War Illustrated had been out just five days when it found a rival : War Pictorial . Published by Bernard Jones Publications , Ltd. ( whose Radio Pictorial and Football Forecast folded when war began ) , the Pictorial was guaranteeing a circulation of 200,000 . It had 32 pages too , all gravure , with shots of the Westwall , the British Navy , the Royal Family , but no pictures of the war . <P> Press casualty of the week in London was William Burton Burton-Baldry 's pithy two-page financial tipsheet , the Fortnightly Review . Editor Burton-Baldry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in July : " War is not only unlikely , but almost impossible . " With markets disrupted by an improbable war , the Fortnightly Review suspended publication " till the ' all clear ' signal sounds . " <P> British Fascists feared the same fate had overtaken Sir Oswald Mosley 's Action when the first issue after war 's outbreak failed to appear . Actually Sir Oswald 's proofs were held up by the censor until too late for publication . Last week 's Action ( cut from 20 pages to eight ) was out on time , demanding : " What is the policy of the Government in the present War ? At first we were told this was a war to save Poland . Now we are told that it 's a war to destroy Hitlerism . In plain language . . . it 's a war to change by force the political system of another country . " <P> <P> +This week Lord Camrose became chief assistant to Lord Macmillan , Minister of Information .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
