Franklin Roosevelt 's kin often get themselves into the newspapers . One who did so last week was the President 's lusty second son , Elliott , who runs his second wife 's radio station ( KFJZ ) at Fort Worth , and knows which side of his bread bears Texas butter . In one of his semiweekly personal broadcasts he said : " John Garner is in the driver 's seat right now , well in the lead as a likely Democratic candidate for the Presidency . . . . " <P> Last week the publisher of a Seattle , Wash . newspaper frontpaged an open letter to " Dear Elliott " : <P> " Regardless of how the family might feel about it , the fact of the matter is that out here you ca n't stop people insisting that your pa has got to stand for a third term . . . . <P> " We 've got a lot of unemployed folks out here , Elliott , who 've got to be taken care of , and we do n't see how Garner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . If ' Cactus Jack ' and all his bellowing calves in Congress would really get behind the old man and quit sniping at him and upsetting the country and business , we 'd be able to put these jobless to work all the sooner . . . . <P> " So tell Mr. Garner for us that we 're very fond of him , but he just do n't fit . <P> " And while you 're at the job , try to figure out a real honest-to-God Roosevelt New Dealer to take over the old man 's job , so we can all get out of the fishbowl . . . . " <P> The letter was written , of course , by Franklin Roosevelt 's son-in-law , John Boettiger , publisher of Hearst 's Seattle Post-Intelligencer . It got under Elliott 's hide . From Pinehurst , N. C. he retorted to Brother-in-law Boettiger in his best literary style : <P> " You infer by your public letter that I am not as strong in support of the President as you are . I am not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dealer or any other type of supporter of ' isms ' but I am as loyal as you or any one else in the country to my father . <P> " . . . My statement regarding Garner was purely my observation and report to the people of Texas . I have no way nor do you of knowing whether the President would run for a third term or not . . . . What the family thinks or feels has no bearing on his decision . . . . <P> " Texas would like to see a Texan in the White House and so would I. . . . Get to know Garner some time when you get a chance to leave Seattle . You 'll find him to be very much the same kind of a humanitarian thinker that the President is. . . . "
