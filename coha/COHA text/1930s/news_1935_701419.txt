txt With the Senate wheat and cotton amendments to the third Deficiency Appropriation Bill lost in the adjournment of Congress , the administration compromise under which the AAA will increase cotton loans from 9 to 10 cents a pound won the day . Apart from removing the Senatorial affront which some AAA officials had felt might bring about the resignations of Secretary Wallace and Chester Davis , farm administrator , Senators and Representatives from the cotton States diagnosed the administration 's compromise as follows : 1 . It removed possible inequities in administration of the original loan and grant proposal by basing the additional grant to which farmers were to be entitled upon the difference between 12 cents a pound and daily average prices for the staple instead of the average price throughout the marketing season . 2 . It partially met objections in Congress based upon fears that the enforced marketing of 12,000 , - 000 bales of cotton in four months might unduly depress prices , by providing that the loans of 10 cents a pound might be called for by cooperating producers up to Aug. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggregate return to producers by providing a gradual reduction in market prices to facilitate export movements while at the same time maintaining unit prices to producers . 4 . By striking the proposed 90 cent wheat loans from the bill , the compromise removed a threatened blow at the very foundations of the production control programs of the W. Daily Average Price Held Fairer . The essence of the administration 's " compromise " proposal , according to cotton experts here , was the selection of daily average prices on the ten spot markets instead of the average price for the four months , September , 1935 , to January , 1936 , during which producers were to be eligible for the 9-cent loan . It had been argued on the floor of the Senate that farmers might receive considerably more or less than the " guaranteed return " of 12 cents a pound under the first proposal of the AAA . This was because a given farmer might be fortunate enough to sell consistently on the " hump " of the market while others might sell when it was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average monthly prices , Congressional experts contended , would take no cognizance of such contingencies , but the narrowing down of the average price figure to a daily basis would go far to meeting the objection . In addition , while the bulk of the annual cotton crop is marketed between September and January , it was the argument of Southern Senators that a longer time should be provided during which producers would be eligible for the Commodity Credit Corporation loans . Limitation of the loan to that portion of the crop marketed within a stipulated period , they argued , would compel dumping of the entire crop on the market within that period . Export Stimulation Seen . Congressional authorities were inclined to the opinion that the change from the original plan of a 9-cent loan and subsequent grant of up to 3 cents and the revised scheme for a 3-cent loan and grant of up to 2 cents , made little difference either in the marketing rate or volume of output . AAA. officials were still convinced , however , that by keeping the domestic market , through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exports would result . There was universal agreement that the administrative task of the AAA would be immeasurably increased by the change from average prices for the four months to daily average quotations . Should the average price on a day of a sale be 11 cents a pound , the producer selling fifty 500-pound bales would receive a check for $250 . If he had 1,000 bales and sold them in fifty-bale lots on twenty different days , twenty different checks would have to be made out for him by the AAA. to make up the difference between 12 cents a pound and the daily average price . It was emphasized that loans of 10 cents a pound would be made only to such producers as complied with AAA production control programs and they would not be extended to such portion of a crop as happened to be in excess of the 10,500,00 aggregate quota under the Bankhead Control Act . Department of Agriculture figures reveal a total of about 2,000 , - 000 cotton producers who , it is estimated , will produce this year about 11,800,000 bales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growers an income of about $700,000,000 for their 1935 crop , apart frcn AAA rental and benefit payments , the latter adding about another $100,000,000 annually . Outline of the Compromise . The compromise plan , reached in all-day legislative and executive conferences at the White House , was set forth by Administrator Davis as follows : " The objective of the AAA has been to get an average return of at least 12 cents per pound , basis % middling , for the producers of cotton . " The plan announced last week would have obtained this result , but further study shows that certain modifications of this plan will make it simpler to understand and more equitable to individual growers in its general operation , making clear to each producer when he markets his cotton the exact amount he will receive for it . " Under the previous plan it would have been possible for growers of cotton grading ** low middling to receive because of government aid more than 12 cents a pound for their crop . The new plan proposes a loan of 10 cents a pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total received by growers of cotton which does not command premiums can not exceed ' 12 cents a pound so long as the base price is below 12 cents a pound . The new plan will make more definite and certain the amount the grower will receive for his cotton . " Instead of making the adjustment payment on the basis of the four months ' average of the ten spot markets , this adjustment payment will now be based on the daily average of the ten markets . In other words , the adjustment payment will be made on the basis of the ten-spot market average on the actual day that the cotton is sold by the producer . " These adjustment payments will be made through the cotton year up to Aug. 1 , 1936 . As before stated , they will be made to those producers who have cooperated in the adjustment program and who agree to participate in the 1936 crop program . " Loans and payments will be restricted to actual production not in excess of the Bankhead allotment . " This program for loans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as it is physically possible to set up the necessary machinery . The loan forms will be available for the 10-cent loan during the week of Sept. 2 . " The adjustment payments will apply to all sales of 1935 . cotton , including those already made . " While AAA officials at no time minimized the necessity of a reduction in the amount- of the cotton loan from the prevailing 12-cent figure , they had been chiefly concerned over the prospect of 90 cepts a bushel loans on wheat . It was this proposal , they said , that would mean the end of all further attempts at balanced production in agriculture . In support of this argument Farm Administration officials pointed out that a bare majority of wheat farmers are now cooperating under contract - with the AAA to curtail their average planted acreage . Should a 90-cent per bushel loan policy be inaugurated the eventual effect would be to peg the market at the figure , or near it , and to place a premium on non-cooperators . Under the Frazier wheat loan amendment , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracts would benefit about as much from the market price pegging as those under contract , with a resulting breakdown in control enforcement and eventual disintegration of cooperative efforts .
