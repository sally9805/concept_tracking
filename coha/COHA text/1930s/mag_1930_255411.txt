Rats leave a sinking ship , but in the smoldering wreckage of the British airship R-101 a host of rats was found swarming soon after the crash at Beauvais , France . Rats like the banana oil smell and taste of the " dope " ( cellulose acetate or cellulose nitrate ) used for coating aircraft fabrics . Question before the crash court of inquiry in London this week : Were the rats in the wreckage French rats or were they British stowaways in the R-101 , had they gnawed a freshly doped balloonet of hydrogen until the gas leaked ?
