An ancient baseball institution is preseason prognostication . Although most baseball fans are well aware of the fact that April forecasts are foolish , last week on the eve of the widely ballyhooed centennial season , they went ahead predicting how the major-league teams would finish in October . Most weighty predictions came from the baseball writers who had just returned from a two-month training-camp survey of sore arms , batting averages and rookies ' temperaments . <P> Polled by the Associated Press , these experts prophesied that the season would wind up with the teams in this order : <P> American League National League <P> New York Cincinnati <P> Boston New York <P> Cleveland Chicago <P> Detroit Pittsburgh <P> Washington St. Louis <P> Chicago Boston <P> St. Louis Brooklyn <P> Philadelphia Philadelphia <P> National League . The only pennant the Cincinnati Reds ever won , in 53 years of trying , was the one that involved them in the scandalous Black Sox Series of 1919 . That they are the experts ' choice this year is due to : 1 ) the ablest pitching staff in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny Vander Meer ) ; 2 ) some of the best hitters ( Batting Champion Ernie Lombardi , Ival Goodman , Frank McCormick ) ; 3 ) Manager Bill McKechnie . <P> Most baseball fans agree that mild-mannered Bill McKechnie did the most amazing managerial job in the major leagues last year when , in his first year with the Reds , he brought them from the cellar to fourth place-only six games behind the pennant-winning Chicago Cubs . They might have won the pennant had not Pitcher Lee Grissom , rookie prodigy of the year before , broken his ankle in a stupid attempt at base-stealing toward the end of the season . <P> American League . Although the World Champion New York Yankees are overwhelming favorites to win their fourth straight pennant , the most talked of team in the league is the Boston Red Sox . To camp followers this spring they showed such class that they are generally given an outside chance to beat the favorites to the wire-or at least give them a run for their money . How much of a threat they turn out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rookies : Ted Williams , Jim Tabor and Woodie Rich . <P> Runners-up to the Yankees last year , the Red Sox were a powerful offensive team . They had the best batting average ( .299 ) in the league , were 25 percentage points ahead of the Yankees . But they were weak in pitching . And pitching is considered 80% of baseball . To improve their defensive strength , Owner Tom Yawkey last winter bought Elden Auker and Jake Wade from the Tigers and Denny Galehouse from the Indians . But the pitcher from whom they expect big things ( just in case Lefty Grove 's arm is really dead ) is Woodrow Rich , 22-year-old hillbilly , who won 19 games for their Little Rock farm last year .
