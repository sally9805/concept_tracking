Early in 1931 New York 's Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt called up a lawyer friend in Rochester , told him he had a little work for him . The Governor wanted George Slingerland Van Schaick ( pronounced Skoik ) to be his insurance commissioner . Over a lengthy luncheon Lawyer Van Schaick protested that he had never held public office , that he knew nothing about insurance . Tut , tut , replied the Governor , there were plenty of insurance experts in the department . What Mr. Roosevelt wanted was an administrator . So at one of the most critical periods in insurance history George S. Van Schaick took over the insurance department of the biggest insurance State in the Union . Governor Roosevelt 's one order : " I want the department conducted right . " <P> Last week in Manhattan George Van Schaick was the chief witness in a State investigation to determine whether he had faithfully obeyed that order . Governor Lehman had ordered the investigation at Commissioner Van Schaick 's own request . But the curious thing about the probe was that almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York 's big life companies . What had drawn fire was a business tucked away in the department 's " miscellaneous bureau " - guaranteed mortgage companies . <P> The sorry plight of the mortgage companies arose from the fact that they had guaranteed 35% of all the mortgages in New York City and that by 1932 this $3,000,000,000 contingent liability had largely ceased to be contingent . Underlying mortgages defaulted , foreclosed property became practically unsaleable and investors demanded that the companies make good their " guarantees . " ' When the situation threatened the whole banking equilibrium , Manhattan bankers , backed by the RFC , made futile credit gestures . By that time , however , most of the large companies were quite insolvent . With a sigh of relief Commissioner Van Schaick clamped down on them during President Roosevelt 's March Moratorium . <P> Hastily Governor Lehman secured legislation creating a quasi-public protective committee to salvage something for the hundreds of thousands of investors who had bought mortgage bonds on the strength of the " guarantee . " In August a flock of small solvent companies were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outstanding guarantees were taken over for " rehabilitation . " <P> No sooner had this been done than a deafening hue &; cry arose in nearly every court in the State . The constitutionality of the enabling legislation was challenged . Commissioner Van Schaick 's rehabilitation plans were attacked at every step . " Protective committees " mushroomed on every side , tried to oust Commissioner Van Schaick in favor of Federal bankruptcy trustees . Individual investors demanded the property underlying defaulted mortgages . The mortgage business in New York threatened to become a lawyer 's holiday .
