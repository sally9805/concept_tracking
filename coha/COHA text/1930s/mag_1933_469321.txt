Miss MARY SMITH , an imaginary but typical young lady who is employed as a buyer of dresses by the mythical but representative department store of Jones Brothers in a city west of the Missouri , is gazing at the towers of Manhattan as they rise above the desolation of the Hackensack Meadows . In a few minutes the train will roar into the tunnel ; in a few minutes Mary Smith will emerge into the capital of wealth and pleasure and fashions , to spend there a week of hard work , strange parties , and new faces . The mountain range of slender skyscrapers , jewel-colored in the evening air , fills her with vague , restless joy . Like all her trips to New York , this one , she feels , is going to be fun . There is , however , something in the back of her mind which dulls her anticipation and stings her conscience as definitely as if it were a splinter in one of her neatly gloved fingers . A trifle , really ? how ridiculous to let oneself be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is different . It is not the fur coat 's fit , which is perfect , nor its pelt , which is genuine fox , but the manner of its acquisition that troubles Mary Smith . On her last trip to the " market " she looked in on Kleid and Stoff , manufacturers , from whom she had occasionally bought before ; she liked their line " and ordered about two thousand dollars ' worth of dresses . When the formalities and paper work wereover , and she and Mr. Kleid were talking about business and the weather , she asked ? it just slipped out ? if he knew where she could get a good fur coat cheap . Mr. Kleid ? and as she looks back on the incident she thinks she remembers noticing a subtle change in Mr. Kleid 's manner ? replied that he did n't know offhand , but would inquire and let her know . At what hotel was she staying ? Mary Smith told him , and in the course of the next few days ' rushing about and warding off importunate salesmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ten minutes before she had to catch her train back to the West , there appeared in her hotel room a messenger with a large box . Inside was a fur coat , and a card : " with the compliments of J. Kleid ; wishing you a happy journey . " In a hurry and dazed with weariness , she tucked the coat under her arm and dashed for the station . Only at Newark did questions begin to sprout in her mind . Where was the bill ? Why should Mr. Kleid go to all that trouble ? How much was the coat worth ? Little though she knew about furs , she could see that , while not exactly priceless , it was a very fine piece of fur indeed . . She spent the rest of the trip in an alternation of admiration for the coat and resolution to send it back . Arriving at Jones Brothers with the coat wrapped round her , she told the story , and her misgivings , to her friend and fellow-buyer , Helen Robinson , who described it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever bounced off of me , honey . " So she wrote Mr. Kleid a little note thanking him for his " thoughtfulness , " and kept the coat . It was all part of the game , she reassured herself . Yet still she was uneasy . Mr. Kleid had probably interpreted her innocent question as a hint . To accept a gift was one thing ; but she could n't help feeling that to seem to ask for a gift was probably on the wrong side of the line between the graft that is honest and the graft that is not . The train rolled into the Pennsylvania Station . She gave the porter sixty cents and thought that his thanks were a little blurred . To make up for this possible injustice , she gave the red rap a quarter , and was relieved at the size of his grateful grin . Then there was the outstretched hand of the taxi driver , and the furtively callous expectation of the bellboy who pocketed a dime for unlocking the door to her room . Tipping should be abolished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is less a transaction than a bribe . Why could n't porters and taxi drivers live on their wages ? Because their employers knew that those wages would be eked out with tips ? Then they ought to pay them enough to make tipping unnecessary . Mary thought of her own salary . Was fifty dollars a week enough to pay a woman considered competent to buy thirty- , forty- , fifty-thousand dollars ' worth of merchandise a year ? Surely Mr. Jones knew that all his buyers let salesmen take them on parties , send them theater tickets , flowers , candy , dresses , fur coats ? And did n't Mr. Jones allow for that when he made out his salary list ? What would Mr. Jones say about her fur coat ? Might he not remind her that even bellboys neverdirectly ask for a tip ? Angrily she tossed the growing knot of scruples and self-questioning from her mind and went to work ? which consisted of going over lists of manufacturers on whom she must call , and telephoning the Times to have her name inserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she went down to the lobby . The hotel ? which I wo n't name ? is one of the few in New York that can count on a regular and lucrative flow of transients ? most of them men and women who come , some of them many times a year , to buy millinery and notions and corsets and wash goods and dresses and piqu ? swagger coats and a thousand other things for the big stores of Omaha , Little Rock , Muskogee , Zanesville . The lobby , like a club , is thronged with these buyers . Here Mary Smith finds old friends , many of them intelligent , educated girls like herself , some of them college graduates , along with the breezy talkative hard-faced females who have been in the racket a long time . Very few of the big store buyers are men ? the men in this lobby arc the buyers for jobbers , or they are merchandise managers , shrewd heads of departments , each one with a platoon of specialized women buyers under his command . They have come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to market , with these differences , that what the housewife brings back will always be eaten , while the store 's customer will not consume goods unless he likes them ; that the corner butcher and grocery stores are hardly entertaining , while the buyer 's annual or monthly or fortnightly business trip to New York is also something of a lark away from home , and a visit to the biggest fleshpots in the United States . In the lobby Mary Smith meets her friend Sadie , who for twenty-odd years has been buying the strange things women wear , and knows not only every one in the business but every last dodge and wrinkle of the game . They sit down to gossip . " Well , I am all dated up , " says Sadie ; " dinner and a show every night this week . . . who 's that over there ? Why that 's Joe Brown , the merchandise manager for Blank and Blink . Smart fellow , Joe . He 's salted away a big pile . How did he do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a ten-room home in Grosse Pointe on a Blank and Blink salary . When he was a buyer he got his five per cent on all sales from the manufacturers regular . Most merchandise managers are square ? they 'd lose their jobs quick if they were n't . But Joe does n't have to do it any more . That old blonde with him ? She 's his head buyer . She gets away with murder , just goes round with her hand out . Sure , he knows But she 's got too much on him from the old days when they were buyers together . Maybe she gives him a rake-off once in a while too . A fine pair of crooks , if you ask me . What do you say we go up to my room and have a little snort ? That salesman from Dreamfrocks sent me half a case . He says it 's pre-war . " Over the Dreamfrocks whiskey they discuss the lighter side of their profession , as well as some of its difficulties . How hard it is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of climbing a rung higher on the ladder ; the opportunities of an amorous merchandise manager , the girls they have known ? such private information normally becomes public property in a big store ? who have made their way in the world by sleeping with the head of the department . As Mary is about to go she notices Sadie 's handbag . " Where did you buy that ? " " Buy it ? Say , angel face , a smart buyer never buys anything ? for herself . It 's a useful little bag all right , but it does n't look like much . That 's the annual big Christmas surprise from Dreck and Spink , the cheapskates . And even then they act sore if I do n't order by the gross . " In bed , mellowed perhaps by the whiskey , comforted by the business morality of a buyer whom she knows to be honest , and who considers herself to be thoroughly honest , Mary finds that she can think about the fur coat without wincing , and can even face the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometime during the week , and that she may not like their " line . " Mary gets up at seven the next morning , slides her lists and her order blanks into a briefcase , is treated to breakfast by one of the salesmen who already throng the lobby , and marches out to the market ? not forgetting , however , to glance first at the paper , in which , buried in five columns of " Arrival of Buyers , " she finds herself : PRAIRIE CITY ? Jones Brothers ; Miss M. Smith , fall dresses . 125 West 3lst Street . II Before following Mary to the mysteries of that prosaic street number , some remarks on the business of making and selling dresses are perhaps in order . It is not so much a business as a gamble . Fashions are incalculable , they come and go swiftly , and the manufacturer of dresses is like a theatrical producer , who never knows whether or not his show is going to be a hit . One style of dress , designed with a careful eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next few months , may inexplicably fall flat ; another may turn out to be a " number " that " clicks " and rolls up a quick profit of many thousand dollars . The possibility of large and easy profits attracts manufacturers , many of them operating on a shoestring , as honey does wasps ; a former salesman , a man who was hardly more than a peddler , may rent a loft , hire a designer , machinery , salesmen , cutters , girls , and start in on a few thousand dollars ' capital . It is a business that may start from nothing , soar to prosperity , and as quickly sink to nothing again ? an ebbing , flowing business , overcrowded as a public beach . The mortality is terrific , but always exceeded by the birth rate : let a manufacturer ( and this is a common fate ) succeed so well that he decides to expand , and overexpand and fail ; another comes along to take over the empty loft within a week . By its nature it seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best chance of success ; it has never been , and apparently can not be , merged and combined into large and stable corporations . So it remains a whirlpool of small , perishable and , therefore , savagely competitive units , subject to laws that are less human than of the jungle . To whom does this productive jungle sell ? Who is its customer ? A very different type of commercial organism : the thousands of dry goods and department stores , all over the United States , where the forty million women of the United States buy their clothes ; large , stable , ancient , complicated organizations , chained to vast investments in real estate ; stores with such possibility of enormous and continuous earnings that they are ruled by experts , by scientists , by men who have spent years in the monastic calm of graduate business schools mastering the mysteries of merchandising alone . Into the jungle where dresses are manufactured the distant stores send wave upon wave of trained , specialized buyers ; the battle , so unequal in these United States , between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are afraid to buy more than they can sell , is here accentuated . Exceptfor rare flurries when the forty million silent women suddenly switch their taste in sport suits or evening gowns and catch the stores napping , this market is a buyers ' market . The stores send their army of buyers a-hunting into the market , into the jungle , confident of the upper-hand ; yet such is the rivalry among the sellers that the buyers turn out to be the hunted , and sometimes fall half willingly prey to the traps and baits and bribes of salesmanship ? as we shall see . Physically , the dress center of New York is a most curious example of commercial behaviorism . With all the square miles and half-rented space of this overbuilt city to choose from , the dress market is concentrated in a few blocks on Broadway and Seventh Avenue just south of Times Square . Perpendicularly concentrated : a wise manufacturer knows that he is lost unless he sets up shop in one of the half dozen loft buildings that are , for unfathomable reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper Thirties , can be seen , side by side , two immense buildings ( alike in every essential but the psychological ) one of which is an ever rentable beehive , while the other , nobody knows why , has lost caste and tenants , and languishes . It is a tiny village within the gigantic city : on the street everybody seems to know everybody else ; everybody , buyers and sellers , meets for lunch at the same restaurant ( there are hundreds of others , many with better food and service , within five minutes ' walk ) . The buyer need scarcely cross Broadway twice to cover the entire market , and most of her travels are done in an elevator . But the seller , being the underdog , has to run all over town if he wants to see the buyer during the brief hour when she holds court at the vast buying headquarters which her store runs cooperatively with many others from out of town . Mary Smith , brief case in hand , walks briskly into her many-celled headquarters at a quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner of the lobby to the left , which is reserved for salesmen . The salesmen know that she and the dozens of other buyers are in town ; they scan " Arrival of Buyers " ; they subscribe to a daily bulletin which keeps them posted , they tip the hotel clerk to let them know who has registered . Already on her desk are a dozen blue slips of paper , formal blanks bidding for her attention , filled out by waiting salesmen . She quickly checks one of the spaces for her answer : " Will see ; will not see ; call again on ? " ; or " will call to see your line , " and the slip goes out to one of the hungry mob beyond the barrier . She never sees the half of the slip kept by the salesman , who is crustily warned not to smoke in the sample rooms , not to try to get in without appointment , to transact his business promptly , to expect no attention after ten o'clock , and to use only the elevator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is serenely unaware of , the nervous , milling crowd of salesmen outside , who have just one hour in which to attempt to interview a dozen buyers in as many scattered offices . The salesmen do not take this haughty treatment lying down . Every few moments one of them opens the inner door and is unceremoniously pushed out by an attendant . They besiege the office boy who collects the slips , and if one of them gets through it is probably because he has given the office boy a dollar now and then . In fact , the office boys arc frequently changed , so that the dollar bills wo n't breed too much favoritism . The raging , artful salesmen storming the barrier , the cool , despotic buyers in the shelter of the sample rooms , seem to be acting a queerly symbolic drama of man , the eternal pursuer , and woman , the eternally pursued . Pursued and , eventually , captured , though only by the use of presents , parties , patience , and brass . But at best she seems fickle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models that the store can get rid of without marking them down . A little after ten , having seen several buyers and turned down with a check mark on the blue slip twice as many more , Mary goes out . The corridor is full of salesmen , hat in hand . They are n't supposed to be there , but they are desperate , and must catch a few words with the buyers somehow . Some of the men in this corridor are buyers too . You can tell which is buyer and which salesman not only because the buyer keeps his hat on , but by his confident , careless manner , while the salesmen have that pleading , ingratiating expression which says , " Please listen to me , I 'll only bother you a minute . " Mary might be the cabinet minister of some Balkan despot , forcing her way through an antechamber full of petitioners . " I 'd like you to see our line . . . We have some swell new models . . . Aw , Miss Smith , just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't time to be a good scout . " I 'll let you know . . . Maybe .. Sorry , not to-day , " Somebody suddenly shakes her hand greedily . A little man whose name she ca n't remember , but whose face is vaguely familiar sidles up and says , " What are you doing to-morrow night , Miss Smith ? Lemme take you to a swell new speakeasy . . . . " The rest of the day Mary spends in the village , calling on manufacturers , looking at dresses , dresses , until it seems as if her eyes could no longer tell the difference between polka dots and stripes . Everywhere the salesmen , and the manufacturers too , are at her . When she leaves the offices of Acme , a salesman from Art Mode , whose offices are on the same floor , pounces on her . He saw her go into Acme , and was waiting . When she reaches the street the curb is lined with figures as alert as hawks , and strangers rush up to her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll come to see their new line . All day this sidewalk perch will be loaded with these birds , the less self-respecting salesmen for the smaller manufacturers , waiting for their prey . The cops move them on , they disperse quickly and as quickly gather again . At noon she lunches , with other buyers , at the village restaurant . More salesmen come up , pass the time of day , put in a word of business , and one bold fellow grabs their check and pays it before the women can say a word ? which they are in no hurry to say anyhow . And so the week goes . Dresses , dresses , and salesmen , salesmen , all day long . It 's tiring , but the pace is furious , and life is exciting . Naturally , she is a little dazed , and suddenly finds herself walking out of Kutefrock with a dress for herself ( gratis ) under her arm , and realizes that she has promised Mr. Flink of Artrobe to go to a roadhouse with him Thursday night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplicating voices interrupt her in the lobby , " I have a pair of tickets . . . " Her room , before the week is over , is gay with three large bunches of flowers , a five-pound box of candy , and a robin 's egg-blue portable typewriter . Three times she rises dripping from the bathtub to answer the peremptory tinkle of the telephone and tries to be polite to male voices asking when they can see her , if there 's anything they can do for her while she 's in town . Her evenings are crowded : dinner at Tony 's with champagne , third row of a musical comedy , grandgala premiere presentation of a new talkie , parties of eight or ten buyers and salesmen , full of kidding , wisecracks , and snatches of shop . For none of this does she have to pay a nickel . There 's only one New York ; she works hard all day , and if people want to put themselves out , even if they are salesmen and manufacturers , what of it ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sally , an intimate friend and also a buyer for Jones Brothers . " What do you know , " says Sally confidentially ; " when I asked for my bill the clerk gives it to me already receipted . He just gives it to me and says , ' Mr. Shafer tried to get in touch with you . ' Then he winks . I suppose I ought to subtract it from my expense account . But if I did it would look funny . Hell , Jones Brothers do n't pay me enough so I should get goody goody . " Toward the end of her stay Mary steels herself to do something she has been trying to keep out of her mind . She must call on Kleid and Staff . if she does n't , the merchandise manager will be angry , for Kleid and Stoff have a good line . But if she does call , the ghost of that fur coat will come along too . With an effort of will she calls . Mr. Kleid is glad to see her ; Mr. Stoff has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a swift sinking of the heart , Mary realizes , as she examines ( more slowly than her experience makes necessary ) a hundred sample dresses , that something vital departed with Mr. Stoff or the designer , that the goods are rotten , and that she will get it in the neck if she buys any of them . What is she to do ? There is only one thing to do . " Well , Mr. Kleid , 1 ' 11 drop in again the end of the week . " A traditional phrase , usually accepted in the business as the equivalent of No . Mary sweeps out , as guiltily as if Mr. Kleid 's fur coat were round her shoulders . ARRIVAL All day , like a stab of recurring pain , the thought assails her that she is a crook . She tries to reassure herself : everybody does it ; almost all the buyers she knows , honest girls too , accept parties , presents . The crooks are the rare ones who get a rake-off , in cash . But what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between a secret five per cent commission and hundreds of dollars ' worth of food , drink , flowers , and little packages at Christmas-time ? Gradually , inexorably , she feels her terror and her shame pushing her toward a solution , a great decision , The telephone rings . Those damned salesmen ! Thank God she was n't in her bath this time . A low , male voice . " Hello , Mary . This is Henry . Want to have dinner with me to-night ? " Henry is one of the few real friends she has made in New York . It began when she was buying , and he was making , lingerie . Now she is buying , and he is selling , something else . Henry has grown up in the clothing business . Manufacturer , salesman , he has been everything , done everything , knows everyone . Perhaps he can help her . " Yes , I will , Henry ? but on one condition ? the party 's got to be Dutch . What ? Oh , I guess I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven . " At dinner she unburdens herself , tells him everything , about the fur coat , the presents , what she thinks is her dishonesty , about what other buyers do , about the dirty and tip-taking side of her business . At first Henry is soothing , tolerant , he even repeats the old line , " It 's all part of the game " ; adding , " You ca n't keep clean if you 're working in a sewer . " Gradually he becomes more general and reminiscent , telling her things that any frank clothing or dry goods manufacturer knows ; that any manufacturer or salesman of dresses ( and of cargoes of other things besides ) could tell you . For years ( the custom probably goes back beyond history ) sellers have known how to make buyers feel well disposed toward them by taking them out to dinner and a show , by showering them with candy , flowers , liquor , clothes , jewelry , occasionally even automobiles . For years the larger and better stores have strictly forbidden their buyers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salesmen have counted entertainment as a fixed portion of the cost of selling ; for years many manfacturers have made , in their budgets , special provision for such entertainment and gifts . Every Christmas the organ of the Retail Dry Goods Association prints an editorial condemning the practice ; every Christmas there pass , from salesman or manufacturer to buyer , thousands of red-ribboned packages worth millions of dollars . One woman buyer has a safe deposit box ? not a small one either ? full to the brim of watches , bracelets , earrings , and other more or less valuable tokens of esteem . Is she a crook ? " No ? she is one of the toughest women in the whole business to sell . She 'll turn you down flat if she does n't like your Iine . " Another girl established a record by getting as presents from manufacturers three grand pianos in one year . Then there are buyers ? probably a small part of the total ? who are paid by the manufacturer five per cent commission on all sales to their store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quiet family agreements with them . The bulk of this good-will traffic , however , is entertainment , in providing which the manufacturers show imagination and ingenuity . One of them has a camp up in the mountains , where buyers ( what 's the harm in being a fellow 's guest ? ) may canoe , and rest , and drink and eat all they want for nothing . Another has gone even farther : his staff consists of young and attractive people of both sexes . They are hired to help him sell , but they know that their real function is to give the buyers a " good time " ? which you may define as broadly as you please . One of the staff is Jim , a blond , exceptionally good-looking young man . " Jim , " says the boss , " Mrs. So-and-So is in town . Take her out to-night . " And if Mrs. So-and-So invites him up to her room ( the hotel has discreetly withdrawn all its floor clerks ) , and if one thing leads to another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though Mrs. Soand-So may be twice his age , and her person not quite such as to entice him if this were n't " part of the business . " A business in which stories are rife as to the more intimate favors whereby the buyer may be made to feel grateful . " But women , " says Henry , " wo n't go out on a party with you unless they like you . Women are always fastidious ? even in this racket . " Mary Smith wants to know if women , in his wide experience , are more honest than men . " Yes , they like parties , and a wristwatch or a fitted bag or a fur coat now and then ; but what women buyers really appreciate is attention . They are far from home and lonely . They want somebody to be nice to them . And is there one woman out of a hundred , no matter what the business relationship may be , who will not let the man pay the check , who will feel that candy and flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But all that , continues Henry , is chicken feed . What of it if his bill at a theater ticket broker 's averages a hundred dollars a month ? What of it if his fellow-manufacturer , Mr. X , who sells to jobbers and , therefore , to men buyers , has a charge account with a " call-house " which will , at his expense , provide buyers with good-looking girls on five minutes ' notice ? More serious , more harmful to business , are the big rake-offs and secret commissions , the buyers who are earning a hundred a week but obviously living at the rate of twenty thousand a year ; the buyers who are practically partners of certain manufacturers ; the buyers for the big nation-wide chain and mail order houses who will let a manufacturer rent and furnish their apartments in addition to a five per cent commission on sales ; the executive supervisors of these buyers who know of such an arrangement and get a slice of it themselves . The older and more famous are these houses ? so it seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graft . Real graft ? the kind of graft that gives one manufacturer the inside track , and deprives the consumer of the price benefit of free competition . " I do n't mind , " says Henry , " having to give the boys a good time and a new car now and then ; I do n't even mind if one of them asks me for a little loan of a couple of hundred ? which I know he 'll never pay back ; what I object to is a buyer who has been bought for keeps by one of my competitors . " People , remarks Mary , are as a rule honest to begin with ; what are the steps in a buyer 's progress to corruption ? " A buyer , " explains Henry , " and I 'm thinking of men more than women ? is usually small potatoes . He 's advising other people what to buy ? if he had any real guts he 'd be advising himself , and own his own business . Point number two : his salary is low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing through his order book . Nothing erodes integrity faster than a sense of injustice . Point number three : he comes to New York , and inevitably contrasts his own simple way of living with that of the manufacturer who calls for him in his limousine and takes him out to his home and fills him up with champagne . ' How can I , ' lie asks himself , ' and why ca n't I , have a life like this ? ' " Then , if I want to take him into camp , I begin to work on him . Subtly . I say , that 's a terrible old bus you 're driving , why do n't you get one of these new Buicks ? ' He answers that he ca n't afford it . I show him how he can afford it . We each know all right what 's in the back of the other 's head , but I 'd like to see him keep his self-respect ; he 's still an honest fellow , I do n't want him to get overboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make him a present of a new car . So I say , ' Bill , here 's an idea . There 's a little stock on the curb that 's due for a big rise ' ( or there are some lots over in Jersey that are going to have a big boom ) , why do n't you get in on it ? ' Bill says he has no money . " ' I tell you what , Bill , you 're a good friend of mine . I 'll buy some of that stock ? or those lots ? for you ; they 're as good as gold ; you just sit back and watch them rise . ' " Of course I do n't buy a single share or acre , but next time I see him I say , ' Still driving that old car ? ' He still is . ' Well , Bill , go right out and get yourself a new one , because you 've got a nice paper profit on those lots already . ' Bill says he does n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the money for that new car . In other words , I 've advanced him some of the money he was going to make on money lent by me . Pretty neat ? Yet we can still look each other in the eye , and Bill can still say to himself that he 's an honest man . And do I get that order ? I do . " Mary asks him where he draws the line between honest graft and crooked graft . " Entertainment , small favors , even small presents , that 's honest graft . As things are in this business , no buyer need be ashamed of accepting them . If you want to do business you 've got to know people ; you 've got to be acquainted with the buyers . That 's personal contact , that 's the first step . Once you know them , and get an order or two , you 've got to stay friends , because it 's reorders that make a profit . Honest graft opens the door , and keeps it open . Other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will order from the man who has been nice to her . ' Honest graft ' seldom has any influence on a buyer 's judgment ? at any rate consciously . I 've hardly ever seen a buyer order bad merchandise to please a manufacturer . She could n't hold her job if she did , and the gravy would dry up with the job . Of course , it 's graft just the same , but when you 've paid it , in theater tickets and presents , you have n't bought the buyer , you 've just bought her good will . That 's not crooked . When presents begin to run into real money , crookedness begins . It also begins when a buyer has her hand out ? even for a trifle . A buyer who takes dough , who gets five per cent , is of course downright dishonest . Not many of them do that . They arc pretty well known , and sooner or Later they lose their jobs . Crooks do any business harm . But the ' honest graft ' is lubrication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothing could not run as smoothly as it does . " But what about the employer , the store , which expects its buyers to be absolutely impartial in their judgment of goods ? What about the public , which eventually pays for the cost of the " oil , " which bears the burden of the graft , whether it is honest or crooked ? How should a buyer who wants to be genuinely square with her employer and the consumer behave ? Henry , while cynical and tolerant , knows that there is a real line to be drawn , but that the drawing of it is , as human beings and as conditions in the trade go , a little too much to ask . A truly honest buyer , he says , would never take anything which he or she was unable to reciprocate in kind , would never accept anything , tangible or intangible , eatable , drinkable or wearable , which she or he could not afford to give in turn to the salesman or the manufacturer , and occasionally does give in return . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she is fundamentally honest , partly because she was thoroughly scared by the fur coat episode , and is by nature timid and under the spell of her own scruples , conforms to it , thereby becoming a curiosity among her fellow-buyers , who do n't see why you should n't have a good time and let the boys send you presents so long as you do n't actually close your hand over United States currency . Mary , in fact , comes to be thought of in the trade as exceptional , indeed rather a crank . But she still has that fur coat .
