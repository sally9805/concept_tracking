An excited , giggling crowd of Delta Kappa Epsilons were numbed into silence when Pledge McElroy fainted from shock , died 15 minutes later . <P> At Duke University last year , a fraternity pledge named Einer A. Palmgren , stripped and painted with shellac , was inadvertently ignited and had to be hospitalized for severe burns . <P> Although most fraternity pledges survive their initiations with a whole skin , suffering only from jitters induced by mouthing blindfold a human eye ( fried egg or oyster ) or worms ( cold spaghetti ) , the week after midyear examinations during which most U.

S. Greek Letter societies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Hell Week its severest slap to date by resolving " to give cordial support to measures to abolish Hell Week taken by any college or university .
