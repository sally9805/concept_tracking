A mixed force of 200 bluejackets and Royal Marines tumbled out of motor lorries at Serowe , Bechuanaland last week , set up a strong wire barricade , a khaki tent fly for a canopy and unfolded two canvas chairs . A host of 15,000 chattering , grinning natives gathered round the fence , for on the chairs sat two mighty chieftains come to judge the native Chief Tshekedi . <P> The ranking senior of the two British officers on the folding chairs was a mighty chieftain indeed . Vice Admiral Edward Radcliffe Garth Russell Evans is one of the most distinguished officers in the British Navy . Born 52 years ago , he is the Lieutenant Evans known to every British schoolboy as the second-in-command of the famed Scott expedition to the Antarctic in 1910-12 . The South Pole did not end Lieutenant Evans ' heroism . During the War he was in command of the Broke when that destroyer and the Swift fought off six German destroyers in 1917 . Three times since the War he has been given medals for saving life at sea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written a number of healthy adventure stories for boys . What took this most gallant officer to the blazing heat of Bechuanaland was the disgraceful conduct of a lecherous Scotsman known as Phineas Mackintosh . <P> Bechuanaland is officially native territory . Lewd Phineas Mackintosh took advantage of that fact to marry a blackamoor ( a crime in the Union of South Africa ) , and to seduce numerous other Bamangwato tribeswomen . <P> Regent of the Bamangwato tribe is a handsome young man known as Tshekedi . He was educated in Britain at great expense , speaks English like an actor . His administration had been exemplary but , faced with the case of lewd Phineas Mackintosh , he ordered him tried by a native court , had him flogged within an inch of his life . <P> There was no question of lewd Phineas ' guilt . He had admitted everything . But if Britons should allow natives to try them , there would soon be no Britons in Africa . Admiral Evans , now acting High Commissioner for Bechuanaland , and the Resident Commissioner Col. Charles Fernand Rey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Chief Tshekedi , backed by a corps of lawyers , argued his case most fluently , adding considerably to the brilliance of the scene by appearing throughout the trial in a pair of pink-striped pajamas from Bond Street . The hero of the Antarctic mopped his brow under the withered fig-tree and gave judgment : 1 ) Lewd Phineas was banished from Bechuanaland forever . 2 ) For daring to punish a white man , Chief Tshekedi was removed from the Bamangwato tribe , exiled from his tribal lands . Admiral Evans pronounced the verdict on Chief Tshekedi as sympathetically as possible : <P> " It appears that you are an extremely capable and good chief , able to deal with your people and to lead them , but you admit flogging a European . . . . You have set a very bad example . " <P> While Chief Tshekedi appealed the decision to the Colonial Ministry , his mother , the Dowager Queen of Bamangwato , cabled King George : <P> " O King , release for me the boy . I am undone and the tribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . O let it be regarded . "
