 | The maneuver when complete saw all of the girls at one end of the table and the men at the other , in spite of the fact that each one present wished secretly that they should all be mixed so as to , bring girls and men together . Having once seated themselves in this order , however , the arrangement was perpetuated for all time , for it is a matter of frontier ethics amongst boarders that once a place is chosen , it must never be changed . To switch to some other chair would be a veiled insult to one 's original neighbors on either hand . Consequently , if he on your left mixes coffee with his potato in lieu of gravy and guzzles the resultant mash from his knife blade , or if the shriveled bit ' of femininity to your right muffles a continuous accompaniment to her repast and yours , it is best that you blind your eyes and deafen your ears if you would retain the measure of popularity that maces life worth the living under any conditions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and keep the approval of your landlady . This is essential . At Mrs. Gloster 's board it was particularly essential and most of the new guests present sensed immediately that to disregard this policy would be foolhardy and probably fatal . The old-timers knew that it would be . The lady in question was dividing her time between the dining-room and the kitchen . Her table was her pride , and she treasured jealously her reputation for setting the finest board anywhere on the Range . Woe to the pernickety teacher who picked at her food and complained of it afterward , for Mrs. Gloster , although thoroughly a lady , was entirely hard-boiled in matters of that kind .  | Let ' em get started to complainin ' once and you 'll never have no peace , ' she was wont to say . In view of her clientele there was much pith in this plain statement . Now , the men , ' she would continue with vehemence , ' they 're all right , but some of these flatchested old hens ' ?

Land on ' em quick , that 's my motto , and if they do n't like it , let ' em lump it , say I. ' And as Mrs. Gloster thought , so she acted . She was a large woman physically and in many ways handsome . She carried her six feet of height as erect as a West-Pointer , and her features were regular if somewhat stern . She scorned make-up in any form , and was in no way loath to express her thoughts to this effect . If these thoughts happened to be delivered in the presence of several young school teachers notorious for this practice , so much the worse for them . Her native New England independence was ever foremost , and many struggles during her fortyodd years had brought out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tender beneath it all and a sturdy defender of any one she selected as a friend . One son she had , an only child by a former marriage . She had named him Percy , and in spite of this he had run away and joined the navy . Her only picture of him showed a young Her-  | cules bearing his mother 's stern countenance . He never found it possible to visit her , but sent many souvenirs ; a conch shell from the Bahamas , a clock built into a cocoanut from the Philippines , a stuffed monkey from Burma , and a glass ship in pieces ? from Portugal . All of these objects gravitated to a whatnot fastened into one corner of the parlor , which soon bore a weird collection representing the ports of most of the civilized world . That Mrs. Gloster 's geography was somewhat hazy in no wise discouraged her from describing these ports with voluble and seemingly first-hand authority . That Poicy of mine ! ' she would exclaim ; there never was another like him except his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them Boston cops and wring his neck as easy as he could walk down the street . ' To judge from hef solitary likeness of her sailor boy , this was not an unduly exaggerated statement . In fact , Mrs. Gloster herself did not seem entirely incapable of the feat if the provocation were sufficient . Her appearance of being able to back up any statement she made , plus her directness and power of speech , collected many a delinquent board bill that would have been lost to a landlady of more timid complex . With the mining men she was a great favorite . They enjoyed her board and they admired her frank and honest dealing . She in turn respected them as hard-working , virile gentlemen . Having been raised in New York , she knew only too well the failings of certain classes of men , and , although certain of these  | were allowed to eat at her table , she never extended them her good will nor permitted them to room under her roof . On the Range , these undesirables came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mining men ; such as barbers , drug clerks , salesmen , and bus drivers . As Mrs. Gloster looked over her present gathering , she exulted in the fact that nearly all her male guests were mining men . This meant few if any complaints and orderly meals , for the mining men were well represented in local politics , and few of the teachers would risk the chance of being known as rowdies . ' before men more or less in touch with the school board . She loved order and only resorted to her fighting ability when called upon to preserve said order , or , as aforementioned , to persuade delinquents that rent day was rent day . While the platters were still passing busily back and forth across the food-laden table , heavy steps sounded on the front porch . The diners suspended operations and looked up expectantly as their hostess swept out to investigate . She swung open the front door and they heard her cry out in astonishment . Well , for lawd 's sake , look who 's here ? Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dressed up like Mrs. Astor 's pet horse ! Come right Agin , there 's two places all ready for you . ' . She led them inside with every evidence of hearty ' ; welcome and took their hats and coats a sign of unusual favor and a gesture only , though indicative of ly training , for she immediately returned them that they might be carried upstairs .  | Your room is all fixed up and ready , ' she directed Carpenter after a few moments of conversation . I I guess you can still find it , seeing as how you 've been here considerable before . ' Carpenter ran upstairs with his bag and , delaying only long enough to wash , returned below to be ushered into the dining-room with Old Dan . Folks , this is Mr. Armitage , whom most of you already know , and this is Mr. Bryan Carpenter . Bryan is just back from New Yawk , and Mr. Armitage here had to go halfway down to Duluth to meet him , he was that anxious to get him back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests , displaying an excellent memory for names and a poise seldom encountered amongst women at the helm of boarding-houses . A ripple of excitement passed about the circle of teachers . Armitage was popularly supposed to be worth nearly a million , and many were the caps that had been tilted in the past to ensnare the taciturn old miner 's heart ? each attempt serving but to increase his stubborn contempt for the younger members of the fair sex . He was not a crabbed type and he enjoyed the friendship of many of the older teachers , but for the green young girls who swarmed onto the Range each year , he had no use . J " Tai n't natural , ' he would complain , for a young gal to pay any attention to an old bird like me .

' Of the men . ts , both he and Armitage knew many , and the i osphere of the remainder of the meal was less se . The arrival of the late comers provided a in the strained silences which had emphasized clatter of cutlery earlier in the meal . Nov every attempted to make up for his or her previous state dumbness . The men addressed Carpenter and ' tage familiarly and very often as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ' ire two semi-celebrities were very well known to indeed . The teachers , on their part , whirled conversations involving their uncles who were eynors and their rich friends who lived most of the r in Europe . From these topics they gravitated t R a lively discussion of travel ? and unimaginative the teacher who could not tell about a visit to iv York or Chicago or New Orleans . On the fringe of . all this hovered the martial figure  | of Mrs. Gloster . None saw through the subterfuge o noisy talk and awkward gestures better than she , an ' i she reveled in the interest that the arrival of Car penter and Armitage had awakened in her household . Because she felt only contempt for most of the girls who patronized her table and who occasionally mad an always unsuccessful attempt to high-hat her , she delighted in the indifference that her two star boarders could be relied upon to display toward any advances . Because she was a woman , and one of no mean intelligence , she detected each simple art employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many a quiet laugh in recollection of some particularly ludicrous incident . After the meal was over , Carpenter whistled Mrs. Gloster 's bull terrier to heel and he and Dan Armitage left for the Salmon Pit . From the top of the high hill on which the boarding-house was built , the mine was clearly visible , although nearly a mile away . It appeared as a great rift in the earth , its sharp angles softened by the distance and the ugly dikes of stripping nearly obscured by the brighter hues of autumn foliage to the south . Carpenter had changed to his mining clothes , and as they strode forward their boots resounded on the wooden sidewalk . Wooden sidewalks were to be found everywhere on the Range , and were nearly as characteristic of the country as the pits and headframes or the dull shocks of blasts and the whistling of steam shovels . At the base of the hill they turned west at'Dad BIoodsoe 's drug store and walked the block to the  | office . Dan Armitage pushed in through the d which always gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to talk several men who plied him with questions reng his trip East . As nearly every one who rerly or occasionally received mail visited the unted store that served as a government mail stathe scene was colorful and interesting . Groups around watching the milling faces about them engaged in idle conversation that was constantly en in on by loud salutations . Teachers hurup by twos and threes , and after devouring letters read snatches of the contents to one ther . Always some sacred paragraph was too onal and significant to be divulged .

Suddenly a roaring and snarling burst forth under e feet of the mob at the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Men shouted and their ' , arse voices mingled with the falsetto shrieks of the - 9 men and girls . Carpenter surmised instantly the n for the commotion , for dog fights were by no uncommon in those days and were often the t of challenging boasts on the part of the dogs '  | masters . He shouldered his way through the closepacked circle which had instantly formed about the two animals . As he obtained his first view of the combatants , he saw that one of them was Norsk , Mrs. Gloster 's brown-and-white terrier . The other dog was a white Spitz , half again as large as his antagonist . They had not come to grips as yet , for in the confusion of men 's legs and their own first mad gyrations they had each missed the throat . The Spitz was pivoting on his hind legs and snapping with slashing white teeth at the dancing terrier . Norsk , who made up what he lacked in weight in marvelous agility , was flashing in and out like a small phantom . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would give him an opportunity to break within his guard . . Carpenter reached for Norsk and a then shouts of protest went up . A good dog fight appealed . to the barbarian that still lurked in these Nortltmen and they were determined not to have their entertainment spoiled . Lay off , Bryan , ' cried a burly timber boss ; let ' em finish it . Gloster 's dog was as anxious to start somethin ' as the white pup was . ' Inside the post-office the crowd pressed to the door in a surge of humanity that threatened to crush some of the less hardy . A man 's voice could be heard , even above the snarling of the two beasts in the street , crying vainly for room to pass . Carpenter hesitated .

The men shouted a orus of applause and egged the battlers on . In-  | spired with excitement a miner leaned down and thrust the brown dog forward . The push was unexpected and caught Norsk unprepared . Before he could protect himself , the Spitz was on him . He tried to roll , but the white dog was too quick . He had recognized his opportunity and now he held the terrier pinned beneath his superior weight . Suddenly he took to shaking viciously and they saw that he had at last reached the white patch on Norsk 's throat . The terrier was helpless , and although his claws raked the face of his executioner in a frenzy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ebbed as the white dog continued to hold his grip and worried him savagely from side to side . Carpenter stepped into the circle and faced the ring of men . Boys we 're not crying for mercy , ' he said , but you all saw that Norsk got an unfair break . I propose to help him out before he 's strangled . ' There was a hard note in his voice , but there was an appeal also , for the code of rough communities is stern . As he glanced from eye to eye , he discerned the fever that longs for the kill , yet these hard men were just , and several nodded judiciously at his words . A rapping on the window of the post-office momentarily caught Carpenter 's attention . He looked up and noted a big man with a black mustache waving to him imperiously . The man was shouting at him , but , being inside , his words could not be distinguished . The terrier 's breath was rattling in his throat by this time and his legs twitched convulsively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the road . He  | was digging his fingers into the jaw muscles of the Spitz when a man knelt beside him . It was Art McMahon , safety engineer of the Republic Iron and Steel Company . Here , use this , ' he said in his unhurried drawl , and thrust an ammonia inhalant tube into Carpenter 's hand . A moment later the white dog was pawing desperately at his nose and Norsk was slowly gasping his way back from canine Valhalla . Carpenter was still on his knees and the crowd was watching in silence when a man burst through the ring with a roar . What the hell are you doing there ? ' he bellowed , his face convulsed with rage and his big hands clenched like sledges . He took a swift step toward Carpenter and shoved him in the face so heavily that the young man went over backwards into the dust . Now , keep your damned hands off my dog ! ' he roared , or I 'll put you on the crippled list for the rest of your life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giant before him . He had been taken by surprise , but now anger began to mount in his breast like a column of molten metal . He moved forward in a half crouch , at the same time noting with relief that some one had picked up Norsk and was holding him safe from harm . He sensed rather than saw that it was McMahon , for his eyes were fixed on the big man who stood defiantly in his path , breathing anathema with deafening lung power . The youth 's ears began to sing and his eyes to water and he lost all consciousness of those about him . Only the anger-shot eyes  | of his assailant were before him . With a tiger-like spring he swung for the jaw and felt his knuckles crash into yielding flesh . At the same moment a terrific blow struck him above the eyes and his head cleared as though by magic . A deadly calm replaced the surging lust of a moment before , and he smiled slightly , even as he staggered from the blow that had been just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had dropped his head as he jumped in , or the fight might have been over then and there . His own blow had caught his antagonist fairly on the mouth and the big man 's lips were mashed against his teeth and two of the latter broken off short . The stranger was evidently tremendously surprised to find Carpenter still on his feet , and he eyed the younger man with a grim , calculating gaze that indicated that he , too , had lost his first reckless impulse to crush his adversary at a single blow . The crowd had drawn closer and the faces of the onlookers were intent and eager . Most of those in the close-packed circle were fighters themselves , and they now lived this combat almost as though personally engaged . Strong teeth clamped down on cigars and pipestems and muscles flexed in unconscious sympathy . This looked like a fight to the finish , for neither man would stoop to explanations after the blows which had been struck . With a quick shift , Carpenter led with his left . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heavily ringed fist that was held close to his right side . This was the move that the youth had anticipated . He dropped his guard and offered his  | face as an easy target , turning to the right as he did so . The maneuver was perfect . Like the head of a python the big man 's fist shot forward for the jaw . But Carpenter had expected this also . Like a flash he bobbed under the blow and whirled in and to the left with all the force of his legs and torso . His right fist hurtled through space like the shot at the end of a track hammer and crashed with murderous force into the giant 's stomach . It was a blow to fell an ox and the spectators gasped involuntarily with a hollow feeling in their own abdomens . The big man 's mouth opened and his knees caved in beneath his weight . He strove valiantly to keep his feet , but the shock had destroyed his nervous and muscular control , and in spite of his efforts he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood over him . Had the quarrel been of long standing , Carpenter might easily , and probably would have , knocked his antagonist unconscious , for the man was at his mercy and deathly sick . As it was , he held himself in leash , though still half-minded to teach the man a lesson that would probably send him for some time to the restful atmosphere of the nearest hospital . At this moment Dan Armitage broke through the circle . Great guns , lad ! ' he cried , do you know who that is ? It 's McKinlock ? the man who bought the old Leopold . My God , how in hell did you two ever happen to tangle ? ' Several bystanders helped the beaten mining man to his feet . A big touring-car had been stopped by the crowd and they half led , half carried him to it . A man in the back seat jumped up and helped to lift him in.  | One of you men jump up here on the running board and show us the way to a doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands trembling as with the ague . Carpenter frowned in perplexity . Somewhere he had seen this man before . He stepped forward and suddenly perceived another occupant of the car , hitherto screened behind the group lifting his erstwhile antagonist into the tonneau . His eyes met those of Blanche Brundage , and hers were filled with horror and loathing . She did not speak and the car drove away , leaving him standing in the middle of the road with blood trickling down the side of his nose and his face and clothing covered with dust .  | CHAPTER IV BRYAN CARPENTER sat on the top of a long draftingtable , gazing through an unusually poor quality of window glass . The window in question overlooked the Salmon Pit from the second floor of the rough structure that served to house the superintendent 's office , bookkeeping department , and engineering quarters of the Armitage Mining Company . It had purposely been fitted with a cheap glass , as there was no telling at what moment some fragment of rock might be hurled into space by the almost constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakage was just infrequent enough to make it cheaper to replace occasional panes than to put metal grilles over each opening . Carpenter was absorbed in a mental review of the events that had filled the early part of the day . He dwelt long on thoughts of the girl whom he had assisted that morning and recalled with a twinge the expression of horror which had filled her eyes as the big man he had beaten was being lifted into her father 's car . Evidently they had chartered this car shortly after he had left them in Duluth , and had been driven rapidly to the Range . The feat was not an unusual one and many local men had made the drive in less than two hours . Reaching the east end of the Range , they must have come west through Biwabik , McKinley , and Leba , just in time to see the fight on the main street of Taconite . He remembered  | now that the girl had mentioned a trip to Virginia , but he had not understood that it was to be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pit . He wondered whether she would now keep her promise to go with him on a trip of inspection . As he sat idly swinging his boots in space , steps sounded on the stair and Old Dan clumped into the room . Well , ' mused the old miner aloud , hoisting himself to a seat beside Carpenter , I rise to remark that you certainly came home with a vengeance . ' He lighted his short pipe ? its bowl burnt almost down to the stem ? and passed his can of tobacco to the younger man . Ca n't tell yet what difference this is a-goin ' ter make between me an ' McKinlock , but it should n't ought a make any ? seem ' as how it was a strictly pussonal affair . You 're gon na kill somebody yet , though ? beltin ' ' em in the guts that way . They tell me that McKinlock made like he was about to die for an hour afterwards . He 's a tough ' un , though . He 'll get well , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scalp . The boys telled me how it was , ' he continued after a moment , an ' I do n't say as I blame you none , or that I would n't have tried to do the same thing , but you allus get so all-fired , damned mad that you got to nigh kill ' em afore you 're satisfied . Anyhow , he 'll think twicet before jumpin ' on you again , and maybe it 'll help to learn him to keep that bellerin ' of his in his chest where it belongs . ' It 's a good thing for me I did n't hit him a crack like that on the head , ' laughed Carpenter , doubling  | up his fist reflectively , or I sure would have broken a set of good knuckles . He 's a tough bird all right , and next time I wo n't fool him so easy . He must weigh around two hundred and fifty pounds . By the way , ' he went on , give me a few more details of the sale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about in his pockets and eventually produced a pencil stub about an inch in length . His one real economy lay in using both pencils and paper until nothing tangible remained of either . He marked off three squares on the white wood of the table top . These squares were joined together in the shape of an L. Here 's the Salmon , ' he explained , indicating the south square with a gnarled forefinger , and just north of it are our underground workings , and just west of there lies the Leopold , which is this square here . The shaft we sunk three years ago , and which he 's using now , would be about here . At the time we got drowned out , we 'd made just about enough progress to realize that the old Leopold was n't quite so good as we thought she might be , judgin ' from the drilling . Yet this buzzard McKinlock comes along and takes over the whole liability without a whimper . I guess we do n't know as much about mining up here on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the floor and , going to a metal plan cabinet , returned with a roll of blue-prints which he spread out on the table . These were exploration maps and showed the history of each drill hole sunk in any given property as well as listing the chemical analyses of all ore strata encountered , by  | five-foot units . For several minutes the two studied the maps in silence . Then Carpenter straightened up and wrapped the prints with his knuckles . McKinlock 's crazy , Gramp . Crazy as a loon . Look here . Here 's the main ore body of the Salmon . It started only forty feet down from the collar elevation and we took it out pretty cheap till we got down nearly to where we are now . It ran right up to the south property line of the Lone Jack and there a fault occurred . It picked up again over a hundred feet down and kept swinging west . Right inside the east line of the Leopold , it began to peter-out . If it were n't for the upper ore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd never have sunk a shaft and gone after what there was down here , even though there is that pocket of fair stuff down at the very bottom . North of the Leopold is the Admiral , and we know that what we discovered by talking to that crowd checks these records . Now , how can McKinlock make a dime out of a set-up like that ? ' Armitage took a turn about the room before answering . His comment , when rendered , shed little light on the question . It 's their funeral , ' was all he said . Carpenter was about to continue when the sound of rapid steps caused him to hold his speech . A second later a man burst into the room and set a transit and rod in the racks built along the wall . This new arrival proved to be Arnold Hankins , a young engineer who had been employed after Bryan left for the East . Armitage introduced the two and left them to complete their acquaintance while he caught up with some work in his office on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hankins . From all that he could make out , the man was capable and well equipped to handle his job . They discussed transits and surveys and the plumbing of shafts and the condition of the Salmon . Hankins gave a lucid description of the work that was going forward in the pit and brought out a roll of new crosssections he had prepared that summer . Carpenter admired the excellent draftsmanship exhibited in the maps and noted that the man had a peculiar gift for lettering . All of the notes and figures had been penned in with true artistry and possessed a round symmetry very pleasing to the eye . Have you made a survey of the McKinlock property as yet ? ' asked Carpenter . No , I have n't been over , ' replied the engineer . I 've been pretty busy here , and I figured they would not get ahead of me even if I did n't start till around Christmas . ' Carpenter made no comment , but he mentally resolved to suggest to Armitage that such a survey be made . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shaving their property lines . How 's the Lone Jack coming ? ' he asked . Pretty good . We 've sliced out two levels since you went away . ' Gone in north yet to see what 's beyond the pump house ? ' No , we have n't . I do n't believe myself that there 's anything in there . ' Well , it wo n't cost us much to run an exploration drift for a couple of hundred feet . There is a piece  | in there that our drilling records do n't cover , and , even though the one hole they did sink about ten years ago was a white hole , still , I think we should make sure by a check of some sort . ' Hankins suddenly elected to change the subject . A very serious expression took possession of his face and he assumed a gravity that appealed to Carpenter as being a little bit funny if anything ? unless the man was about to relate something in the nature of a secret murder or its equivalent . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your attention , Mr. Carpenter , ' he began . I 've really been waiting for your arrival in order to bring the matter up . I mentioned it to Dan ? Mr. Armitage , that is ? but it 's hard to discuss some things with an old man , especially when he has never had our training . ' Carpenter wondered what in the world was wrong that might warrant such ponderous gravity . His eyes narrowed slightly , too , at the reference to Old Dan 's lack of training . It 's in connection with a pit man by the name of Fogardy . ' You mean Belch ? ' asked Carpenter with a slight smile . Complaints about the Irish track boss had been more or less common ever since Bryan could remember . These complaints had never been to the effect that the man 's work was poorly done , however . Yes ? he 's not a particularly good track boss and he 's taken a dislike to me for some reason . ' What 's wrong ? Wo n't the dinky stay on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes ; so far it has , but he pays no attention o my curve stakes and makes fun of them in front of the men . He 's half drunk about three fourths of the time and all drunk the remaining fourth , and he insists on looking through the transit whenever I have it set up and he always knocks it with his clumsy damn feet just enough to throw it off . ' Carpenter was smiling broadly now , and he cast a look that savored of affection down into the big pit below the window . Do n't get upset on account of the stakes , ' he laughed . Belch never paid any attention to my stakes either , nor my grade stakes , nor any other kind of technical guidance . ' Well , it 's a hell of a note in my estimation , ' rejoined Hankins in an injured tone , to have a trained engineer spend hours making a careful survey and then have a drunken bum come along fifteen minutes later and kick all his stakes down . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire to administer a swift kick to the complaining youth , but he held his disgust under cover and remarked instead that he thought he would take a run down into the pit , as he had not been down since his return . As he walked toward the door , the engineer kept pace with him for several steps and at the threshold held out his hand . It 's been a great pleasure to meet you , Mr. Carpenter , ' he said . I 've heard a great deal about you and it gives me confidence to know that there is a real engineer on the job . ' Carpenter shook the proffered hand and dropped  | down the steep stairs . He knew that he had a tremendous dislike for Mr. Hankins . Ten minutes later he was springing along the ties of a rough track laid along the floor of the pit . Some distance ahead he saw a gang of bohunks engaged in shifting a section of the rails bodily from one location to another . As he drew near , he was greeted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy-set figure burst from the midst of the group and bore down upon him . Blast me fer a damnthed swade if it is n't me boy Bryan ! ' roared this individual with stentorian lung power ; f'where tha hell av yez been these lasht thray years , may I ashk ? ' Carpenter braced himself to meet the man 's rush and , grasping him by the neck , shook with no small violence the massive head and huge shoulders . It was to his undying credit that he was able to do this , for the other grasped him in a bear hug that threatened to cave in his ribs . When he was able to get an arm free , he swung his fist in a swift arc and battered the Irishman 's derby down over his eyes . I 've been down East , Belch , ' he cried , knocking the man 's hands away as he strove to clear his vision of the ruined headpiece ; trying to clean my soul of the taint of rough , uncouth buzzards like you . ' Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye look jist a scummy as yez did afore ye wint ? jist betwaine tha two av us . ' Carpenter enjoyed a feeling of unadulterated pleasure . The cussing and cuffing of this human gorilla meant more to him than the most studied speech of welcome that ever was written . This was  | true because of the unquestioning friendship and loyalty that lay behind the caustic remarks which constituted the Irishman 's sole means of communication . No one had ever known Fogardy to be civil or entirely sober . No one knew where he came from in the beginning . He had turned up one frosty morning twelve years before and informed Armitage that his tracks were the worst laid that it had ever been his pleasure to observe . Armitage had looked him over grimly and remarked that he had better go and tell it to the track foreman . He did not expect to see the Irishman again except as he might go by on a cot , but instead he helped to bandage up the big Roumanian foreman . Still later in the day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bohunk track crew showed signs of industry that had never been in evidence before . That night he tossed Fogardy a heavy mackinaw to cover his unprotected shoulders and at the end of the week the paymaster tossed him a brown envelope . A perfect understanding had existed ever since , though hardly a word was ever exchanged between the track boss and the taciturn old miner . When young Carpenter had appeared on the scene , Fogardy took him in hand at once and ordered him about with unquestioned authority . He would march up to the boy till his square , red jaw and fiery blue eyes were but an inch or so from the youth 's face , and tell him in unprintable terms what a weakling he was turning out to be . Then , without cracking a smile , he would lay a rough hand on the boy 's arm and give him a word or two of encouragement . Carpenter soon  | valued this friendship more than all others save that of Dan Armitage . His moment of greatest pride had been when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that occasion he had essayed his first familiarity ; he had slapped the derby on Fogardy 's head down over his eyes . From that time forward this had become his chosen method of displaying his affection . Fogardy never attempted to dodge the blow , even when the boy grew into his full strength . There were times , however , after Carpenter had got out of sight following one of these vigorous salutations , when the track boss removed his battered headpiece and rubbed his crown solemnly . ' , last 's , ' he would mutter , the lad 's gettin ' a shwing loik a sledgehommer . ' He would then replace his hat with a grunt , fill his mouth with a generous wad of eatin ' tobacco , ' and fly into an orgy of blasphemy at the expense of the stolid and happily uninsultable track crew . This order of things had continued for years . How are the wife and children ? ' asked Carpenter , as he clenched and unclenched his hand to restore the circulation temporarily shut off by the Irishman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Belch Fogardy had neither wife nor child , or at least with respect to the latter he had none that were known to him by sight . Since the Irishman had always insisted on referring to a fictitious family , however , Carpenter had long before fallen in with his humor and punctiliously inquired after the health of the mythical Fogardy brood .  | I understand you do n't follow your stakes as well as you might , ' he remarked . No ! Well , I know how yez come to hear av it ? that slinkin ' little pup av an ingineer told yez . He thinks he 's a great man , draggin ' your transhit up an ' down tha tracks , bot I can lay tha thracks fashter than he can set his damned little wooden sticks up , an ' he knows it . ' What 's doing at the new mine ? anything that we ought to know about ? ' Not that I can sit my eye on , but there 's myshthery in tha air , f'what with strange men on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kape off tha property . ' Do you ever see Cap Knight , these days ? ' Not often ? not haft so often as I see that crawlin ' little son av a hoor av a Hankins . Sure an ' this Hankins lad is shpendin ' all av his spare toime at tha Blanche . ' What 's he doing over there , Belch ? ' That 's a quistion I 've ofthen dishcussed with Missus Fogardy . Sometimes he 's in tha shanty with King Cuff-Links hisself , an ' other toimes he 's settin ' out little shtakes all over tha landshcape . ' Carpenter frowned . Hankins had just told him that very morning that he had done no surveying as yet on the old Leopold property . Although common sense told him that Hankins had probably run a few levels for McKinlock , to pick up some extra money , still his dislike for the man increased . A sudden shouting broke out far above them , and both men turned to look up the steep sides of the pit .  | What they saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loosened in some way from its niche near the rim of the excavation , had broken away and was hurtling down the almost sheer walls . The pit was close to three hundred feet deep at this point , and several shelves , which had formerly been switchbacks , lay in the path of the oncoming meteor . Spurts of dirt flew up at each contact with the sides of the pit , and even as they hesitated the great boulder shot onto the first shelf and off into space as though on some gigantic ski slide . It 's headin ' roight fer tha boys ! ' cried Fogardy , and he whirled to shout a warning . But the track crew were already aware of the speeding death descending upon their very heads , and even as Fogardy 's shout rang out , they dropped their bars and sledges and rushed in confusion up the tracks . The shovelmen across the floor of the pit had also become alive to the situation and a medley of piercing whistles rent the air . They 'll make it ! ' Carpenter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the track boss . The words were no sooner out of his mouth than two of the track layers were seen to fall over each other in their haste and sprawl across the ties . One arose instantly and dashed on , regardless of his companion 's fate . The other tried several times to arise , but at each attempt fell back . Fogardy leaped forward and a dozen bounds took him to the side of the prostrate bohunk . The man 's foot had become wedged in a frog . He stooped to wrench the entangled foot clear and Carpenter  | dropped behind the unlucky trackman and took a grip under the bulky shoulders . Kick it out , Belch ! ' shouted the youth ; it 's jammed too tight to pull it out . ' Fogardy jumped to his feet , shooting a rapid glance over his shoulder as he did so . The great stone had reached the last shelf and even as he turned away it shot into space directly overhead . There were but a few seconds now . With a tremendous kick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regained his balance , Carpenter heaved mightily and swung the helpless trackman over the farther side of the embankment . With a desperate lunge Fogardy catapulted himself into the younger man and the two of them rolled over and over in the red ore below the track bed . While still but halfway down the declivity they felt a shock which jarred the entire vicinity and heard the sharp clang of rock striking against steel . This was followed by a peculiar vibrating whine which grew fainter and fainter . As miners rushed up from all directions , Carpenter and Fogardy untangled themselves and climbed back onto the ties . Not two feet from where they had stood but a moment before lay the great fragment of rock . It had struck just between the rails and crunched through the ties and had buried itself to a level with the roadbed . The end of a steel crowbar lying over one rail had been caught by the tons of falling mass and sent spinning across the pit . Its metallic ring was the sound that the two men had heard as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its approach saved the lives of possibly two or three men nearly  | four hundred yards away . A crew of pipemen stringing water lines up the far side of the pit heard this whining noise just soon enough to enable them to scatter before it whirled into their midst . Striking end on , it pierced a plate of sheet iron like so much paper and continued on to shatter a cast pump frame . All this came to light after there had been time to investigate the damage which had resulted from the accident . At the moment , Fogardy looked up at the high walls of the pit and back again to the great boulder . By Jasus , ' he remarked to Carpenter , you an ' me make a rale team , f'what with my beauty and your intelleck. '  | CHAPTER V CARPENTER swung along the board sidewalk at a rapid pace , avoiding the broken treads which were visible in the bright starlight . He was on his way to Leba to pick up Jean DeVoe , whom he was taking to the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be held in the Taconite High School auditorium , and , as Old Dan Armitage was using the car , Bryan had elected to walk the four miles to Leba . The night was gorgeous and he had plenty of time ahead of him . Jean and he would take the bus on the return journey to Taconite and again when returning to Leba after the affair was over . Ever since childhood he had played with Jean DeVoe , and they had grown up much as brother and sister . Jean was dark , with big brown eyes and saucy tongue . She was vivacious , sweet , and imperious . Carpenter had always taken her to all of the Range events in years past , and yet their attitude toward one another was so practical and offhand that even their school chums had failed to couple their names together in any way save as the best of friends . The last time he had seen Jean , she had been standing on the platform at the Taconite railroad station , when he was leaving for the East . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way without any apparent sorrow on either side because of Carpenter 's imminent leave-taking . They had written several times during the next few months , but Jean 's  | was too restless a nature at that time to permit of constant and regular correspondence . After no reply to his third or fourth letter , Carpenter 's pride had got the better of him , and from then on they had heard of one another only through the letters of mutual friends . As he breathed deep of the clean night air , Bryan suddenly found himself eager for the reunion . There had never been anything sentimental between them , to be sure , nor did he delude himself that there would be in the future , but somehow he sensed a rather insistent craving to see his former companion whose laughter and good sportsmanship made up in his youthful eyes for her aggravating habit of publicly teasing hirn . Days when they had hiked together through the autumn woods , they had been like two brothers with never a cross word between them , and these occasions had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He often thought of the squirrels they had shot and the rabbits they had trapped ? for Jean was as good a marksman and trapper as most men . But when in the company of her girl friends or at social gatherings , Jean 's attitude had always changed , and she seemed obsessed with the idea of making him feel as uncomfortable as possible . She had the faculty of changing almost instantly from a sympathetic comrade to a tormenting little minx , with no more care for any chance victim 's peace of mind than for the rough briers through which she was wont to struggle disdainfully when tramping through the open country . Carpenter recollected that he played the part of victim perhaps oftener than all her other satellites combined .  | He laughed softly as he strode along and wondered if she had changed with respect to this particular quirk of her nature . If not , he would probably require a ready tongue and a quick wit before the evening was over . He remembered Old Dan 's story of how Jean had defended him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gratitude and pride swept through his breast . What a true , loyal little comrade she was , after all ! Still engaged with these thoughts , he entered the limits of the mining village of Leba and shortly was knocking at the DeVoes ' door . It was Jean who came to the door , and as she stepped forward with both hands extended in greeting , he found himself almost unable to believe his eyes . This was not the tomboy pal that he remembered ? this slender , full-bosomed girl with the singularly beautiful features and the gorgeous crown of blue-black hair . Still wondering , she led him into the small parlor , and together they turned to take stock of one another . Well , Jean ? whatever have ? why , you 're a revelation ? you hardly seem to be the same person . ' I have n't changed , Bryan , ' she laughed , though her cheeks flushed with pleasure at his very evident admiration , but you have . Of course it has meant an improvement in your case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own interpretation on this sally . She drew back as far as possible , for he still held her hands , and looked him up and down approvingly .  | Had he only known it , he cut a very presentable figure . Yes , ' she continued judiciously , you 've changed more than I expected ? on the outside , anyway . ' IIe wondered that he had never realized before how lovely her smile could be ? how beautiful she herself was . The hair he had often seen full of cockleburrs lay about her face as gracefully as ripples on a dark pool , and the skin beneath it , that had often been freckled and brush-scratched , was white and velvety . He looked in her eyes and surprised a fleeting expression of mockery . Jean , ' he smiled , Jean , ' and drew her toward him . Her eyes questioned him , but there was something magnetic in the spell that had suddenly fallen over them . He noted that she shook her head ever so slightly , as though powerless to resist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay before him , and he marked with a certain awe , because this was his old playmate , the soft swelling of her young breasts at the edge of her black velvet dress . A clatter in the dining-room effectually broke the spell and brought them to themselves . Like a beautiful mirage the spirit of a moment before was gone and in its place came a hesitant self-consciousness . Carpenter let her hand slip from his , and he fumbled awkwardly in his pockets for his pipe and tobacco . It was so strange a thing that Jean and he , of all people , should have nearly declared a sentiment that neither had ever dreamed of before , so far as he knew . Tantalizing little tomboy Jean ? but what a woman she had become ! Even as her white-haired father  | broke into the room , Carpenter noticed that she regained her composure . She smiled at him again and this time he saw the raillery that had always graced her lips and eyes in the past . After visiting a few moments with Jimmy DeVoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green iron gate clicking behind them as they stepped out of the modest yard . Race you to the bus , ' laughed the girl as they started up the planking , and without waiting for his acquiescence she sped up the board walk . She wanted to get away for a moment . She felt hardly sure of herself for the first time in her experience , and she wished to pierce the composure which in him had always upset her and which she sensed this night more than ever before . Carpenter accepted the challenge , and together they ran toward the arc light several blocks ahead which marked a regular stop for the big buses traveling the east end of the Range . He was astonished at her speed and feared that she might trip over a loose board or some protruding spike , defects common enough in Range sidewalks , but she raced on without mishap , and they brought up together in the circle of light just in time to clamber aboard a Taconite bus . Bending low to escape the ribbed ceiling of the lurching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats on the cross-seat at the very rear . Jean dropped down and drew her fur coat about her . Carpenter squeezed in beside her , albeit somewhat to the discomfort of three passengers already ensconced on the bouncing leather .  | Do you know who 's driving ? ' queried Jean . As he bent low to say he did n't , he caught a delicate fragrance that arose with the white breath of her speech in the sharp air . It 's Cookely Coo ? we 'll hit the bump to-night . He always gives the bunch a ride for their money when I 'm along . ' Carpenter grinned in the dark at her effervescent vitality and braced one hand over his head . Cookely Coo was a Finn bus driver who had been long at the business . His route was from Taconite to Biwabik and return , and he held all records for reckless driving . Halfway between Leba and Taconite was a sharp rise in the road where the highway humped over an outcropping of green rock . This rockbottomed hump was well rounded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the level of the straightaway and both approaches were unusually steep . Early in his experience as a bus driver , the Finlander had discovered that taking this hump a t something like forty miles an hour produced varied and lively sensations on the part of his passengers . Thereafter he religiously observed his opportunity of contributing to the novelty of the trip and soon became famous along the east end of the Mesabi . He derived his name from a peculiar high-pitched yd which he emitted just as the cumbersome bus shot over the crest of the breath-taking bump ? a yell which sounded to his gasping victims like nothing so much as Cookely Coo . The hump in the road likewise became famous and was known far and wide as Cookely Coo 's bump .  | As they bore down the hard-surfaced road , the cutout open and the windows rattling , Carpenter enjoyed a sudden , boyish exhilaration . He slipped his arm around Jean 's shoulders and was rewarded when she reached up and took his hand . He was very much alive to the proximity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfaction invaded his heart as he reflected that there was no one to intrude and claim a portion of her attention . He was groping about in his mind for some argument by which to prolong the bus ride indefinitely when a smothered exclamation caused him to glance over his shoulder . The other occupants of the wide rear seat were leaning forward and grasping the backs of the seats ahead . Hold tight ! ' cried Jean ; here comes the bump . ' The big enclosed bus was roaring down the road , wide open . Trees and rocks , outlined in the clear starlight , flashed past in a shadowy , kaleidoscopic parade . The body of the machine swayed from side to side and the noise of their progress was deafening . Suddenly the floor rose beneath them , and in a second they seemed to be hurtling through space . Then , even quicker than they arose , they dropped again with a terrific crash that must have strained every nut and bolt in the entire equipage . The sudden change in direction produced a sensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the days of perfected acceleration . A medley of gasps went up from the crouching passengers while a blood-curdling yell rent the confined space captained by the redoubtable Cookely Coo . Carpenter 's brace against the ceiling prevented  | him from bumping his head , but he felt Jean rise from her seat , and he clasped her tightly just before they crashed back to the road . One man was thrown from his seat onto the floor and several women passengers shrieked with fright and excitement . There were no complaints voiced , and to Carpenter this was the strangest part of the episode , after living as he had in the East , where people were given to registering their disfavor on the slightest provocation . These folks of the North were of the type which takes what comes and makes the best of the matter . Those who found themselves on their knees regained their seats and laughed with their fellows . Stolid miners , who had ridden for thirty miles without a change of expression , grinned with enjoyment and spoke to their nearest companions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , howled dismally and clawed at his stomach in a manner that sent every one into gales of laughter . With a final jolt as ' they crossed the railroad tracks , the bus swung around a long banked turn and rolled down the main street of the town , stopping with a jerk in front of Dad Bloodsoe 's drug store . Along with several other couples , Jean and Carpenter climbed the steep hill to the schoolhouse . In the still air the voices and laughter of other couples far ahead could be easily heard and the sound of music was distinguishable from time to time . What a night ! ' exclaimed Carpenter as they topped the long rise and turned to look back over the country spread out below . What a country , too ! Man , how I love it and respect it ? it has always  | been good to me and I never want to leave it again . ' Jean stood at his side . She noted the deep , throaty tenor of his voice and secretly marveled at the feeling it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and knew that he was entirely unconscious of the act . Could this practical , plodding , hard-working playmate of hers have a capacity for feeling that she had never suspected ? Always he had been so methodical , so intent on mining matters . Was she suddenly discovering that he had unplumbed depths , of which she had lived in total ignorance ? In all her acquaintance with him he had never used an endearing term ? never attempted to kiss her . She had once thought of him with the romantic attitude of a girl of sixteen , but her fancies had fled before the frank blue eyes , which regarded her with eternal respect , but also often with disapproval . Before they had finished high school , she had reached the conclusion that he was as cold and insensible to sentiment as the steel headframes and traprock he was forever telling her about . As a comrade she acknowledged that he had no superior , but she wished for a touch of the lover about him , and this quality he had never exhibited . Could it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her estimate of him was entirely wrong ? Was he , after all , a man in whom leaped the flames of masculine desire for a woman ? She reflected on their meeting of that evening . There had been something in his eyes that had fascinated her ? something that she had never seen there before . She realized that she had been deeply stirred in response to something  | that had arisen from his presence . In another moment he would have kissed her , and in her heart she knew that she wished he had . Her thoughts flew back to an unhappy incident but shortly past . The name of this man by her side had been coupled with that of a woman of the streets . She felt a wave of repulsion sweep over her . Did men exercise so little discrimination as that ? She plucked at Carpenter 's sleeve and stamped her small feet . Come along , Bryan , ' she pleaded ; it 's too cold to stand here and we 've missed the first dance already . ' Carpenter thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . ' That 's my loss , ' he observed , for the first dance was most undeniably mine . ' ' Oh , I do n't know that it was . ' You do n't ? Well , who , may I ask , would be more entitled to it ? ' Oh , any of a lot of decent and self-respecting young men . ' Why the careful description ? ' Well , you would n't want me to dance with any other kind , would you ? ' she asked , and looked him steadily in the face without smiling . Carpenter felt a tightening about his heart . It sounded for all the world as though Jean were accusing him of the shameful qualities she had just deplored by inference as being common to certain members of his sex . Your remarks are rather pointed , ' he said . If the shoe fits , ' began Jean , but she caught  | the quick words and bit her lip . She had n't really meant to say that . She knew that the conversation she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bluff on Swede 's part . If only she had n't listened ! Carpenter strode on in silence . He knew that Jean had heard Swede Nielsen 's vile insinuations , but to find that she accepted them as half if not whole truths was something that had never occurred to him as being even a remote possibility . Swede was frequently given to compromising the male element of the town , and being in no wise hindered by convention or decency her repartee was spicy , to say the least , and quite likely to be recounted in many places more restricted than the Chinese restaurant she knew as home . People usually considered her pleasantries as arising from a warped imagination rather than based upon facts , however , and accordingly credited them with little real import . For this reason Carpenter was shocked to discover that Jean had taken the incident seriously enough to ask for an explanation . He felt that that was what she was doing , and the very thought of stooping to such an accounting was intolerable . By this time they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paving and up the broad entrance steps in silence . Carpenter swung open the bronze vestibule door and held it for Jean . As she slipped past , she threw him a quick glance and he thought that he caught the gleam of unshed tears in her eyes . They separated inside without a word and sought their respective check-rooms.  | Carpenter took off his coat with a heavy heart . What a start for a night of pleasure ! He had looked forward to this evening with Jean for several days , and here an almost impossible situation had developed at the very beginning . She was wonderful in her party gown ? what a pity that idle words should be allowed to come between them ! He dwelt for a moment on the beauty and fresh loveliness that was hers and which he had fully appreciated for the first time so lately . He thought of her supple , shapely young figure ; he thought of how gracefully she would swing along to the dreamy music in the arms of some other man ? and ground his teeth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over which he had stumbled in the gloom of the coat-room , he straightTened his collar and stepped down the corridor . Jean was already waiting in the doorway of the auditorium . Inside , the dance was in full swing . A hundred or so couples were gliding about on the waxed floor . They talked and laughed as they danced . On the stage at one end of the hall was the orchestra , a tenpiece affair imported from Duluth for the occasion . All along the side walls were the seats which served for assembly during school hours . Just now they were occupied by the children and grandparents of the dancers . Wide-eyed little Scandinavians and Austrians sat side by side watching the spectacle , keeping a sharp eye on the alert for Ma and Pa when they might chance to gallop past . Overhead , consecutive arches of bright lights illuminated the room . As soon as the small boys in the audience overcame  | their first shyness and discovered the fuse boxes , . these lights would begin to go out and on again in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most interesting sight to be had . Not only were there all types . and classes of people on the floor , but there also was every type and style of dancing . Well-dressed mining men swung past with the wives of timber bosses or cagemen in their arms , the women bedecked in multicolored creations which crackled in their starchiness . Youths from the supply houses and the machine shops , resplendent in pinchback jackets , contorted about with the younger teachers , and the fathers of struggling pupils shu I ed along in self-conscious silence with the elder matrons of book learning . Finns , Swedes , and Norwegians contributed their blond hair and rosy complexions to the crowd as a contrast to the dark eyes and swarthy skins of Austrians , Montenegrins , Italians , and Serbs . Here and there a morsel of folk-dance was in progress , and occasionally some couple would trip by , each partner of which was executing a step entirely different from the other 's . But practically every one was smiling and apparently happy , and no one cared a snap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or dated back for several generations . As Carpenter and Jean stood surveying the scene , a man squeezed himself out of the crowd and made his way to them . It was Arnold Hankins . He smiled fatuously . Good-evening , Jean , ' he smirked . Hello , Carpenter ? Bryan , I guess I should say , now that you 're  | back with us . Might I have the rest of this dance ? ' Carpenter acknowledged the request with a slight frown and turned to Jean . The girl 's feet were already keeping time to the music and she was smiling at the newcomer . Evidently she did not intend to allow their little difference to rob her of any of the evening 's fun . Why , certainly , ' he said , turning back to the engineer , I 'm sure Miss DeVoe would be delighted . ' Hankins promptly took Jean 's arm and they whirled off into the maelstrom of shuffling feet . Carpenter noticed that Jean 's smile had fled , though she did not look at him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an exceptionally poor dancer . Then he turned on his heel and started for the stairs that led to the boiler-room , where he knew that he would find certain convivial spirits who had already tired of the dancing . He was walking down the dimly lighted corridor when he came face to face with two women who had just entered unattended . Looking up suddenly , the foremost of the two swerved so as to block his progress . He recognized her even in the half darkness as the wife of one of the mining superintendents . Good-evening , Mrs. Redmond , ' he greeted her . Well , Bryan Carpenter ? of all people ! ' replied the lady . I heard this afternoon that you had come back , but I did n't expect to find you at one of these barbarous jamborees after all the splendid affairs you must have enjoyed in the East . But you 're just the person I 'm looking for . I have some one here whom I want you to meet . '  | She called to her companion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with surprise to recognize his inamorata of the morning ? Blanche Brundage . As she came up to him , she smiled and held out her hand . How is my gallant of the railway ? ' she asked . Well , of all things , ' gasped Mrs. Redmond ; where did you two know each other ? ' Oh , we 've had several exciting experiences together , ' replied the girl , and she proceeded to narrate the events of the morning for the edification of the elder woman . Carpenter interrupted the stream of ejaculations and comments by suggesting that it might amuse Miss Brundage to dance . Just the thing ! ' cried the Range woman . I was hoping against hope to find some one I could trust her to . ' Now , do n't worry about me , ' she continued . I 'm used to looking out for myself and I see some people I know . ' Carpenter led the Eastern girl onto the floor and they swung into an enchanting waltz that the musicians had just struck up . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he now thanked his lucky star for the final polish that enabled him to hold his own with this fair partner . You dance beautifully , Mr. Carpenter , ' she said presently ; really I am beginning to think you a most accomplished person . ' Then you do n't think so badly of me as I thought you did when I saw you in the car this morning ? ' he asked .  | Let 's not talk about that ? that fight , it was horrible ! But I suppose you do such things up here and think nothing of it . ' There was a soft irony in the statement that did not escape Carpenter . Do you still want to make an inspection trip through the Salmon ? ' I should love to , but the only time is early tomorrow . You see , my father will be busy , which will leave me free , and in the afternoon we start for Lake Vermilion . ' Then I 'll call for you at eight to-morrow morning ? that 's the time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staying at the Redmonds ' ? ' Yes ; Dad:has an interest in the company for which Mr. Redmond works and it was all arranged before we ever got out here . I shall be ready when you call , though goodness knows how long it 's been since I 've got up at such an unearthly hour . ' Carpenter and the Eastern girl were dancing beautifully together and , quite unconscious of the fact , had attracted considerable attention . They made a regal pair ? Carpenter with his splendid height and muscular gracefulness and the striking blonde girl with her faultless attire and careless , well-bred poise . Smoothly and without effort they glided about the big room , turning and swaying in and out amongst the other couples in perfect cadence with the music . Gradually the other dancers on the floor noticed them and dropped out one by one to watch them . The leader of the orchestra sensed the feeling of the crowd , and , after watching the absorbed couple for a  | moment , turned to his players with a few short words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of the drum fell away to a faint tom-tom-ing ' that was languorous and seductive . The man and the girl forgot themselves and all those about them , in the ecstasy of the dance . Perfectly matched , they moved over the waxed maple with a liquid ease that was beautiful to behold . No step of his but was anticipated by the girl ? no turn or step that she did not follow in perfeet accord with his lead . They seemed to float in a symphony of slow , swinging motion . The big hall was darker now than at any time during the evening , and even the small boys , who snapped out the lights and crept back to note the effect , had been impressed by the silence of their elders and stayed to watch the man and woman who danced all alone on the big yellow floor . From the minds of the two dancers the workaday world had dropped away . Totally unaware that they moved as the focus of all eyes , they drank deep of the pure elixir of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were closed and her lips were parted in a smile that almost had a touch of sorrow . The man moved onward with unseeing eyes ? unconsciously guiding their steps along an orbit contracted constantly toward the location of the orchestra . Gradually ? slowly , the music died away . As though shackled by inviolable bonds to its measure , the couple on the floor slowed with it . The slender little feet in the patent-leather pumps slipped along less and less rapidly and finally ceased their move-  | ment altogether . For a moment Carpenter and the girl stood perfectly still , as though listening for the faintest and last note of the vanished music . Then the drummer clashed his cymbals and pandemonium broke forth . People rushed up from all sides and showered their approval on the pair . After their first astonishment at finding themselves the cynosure of all eyes , Carpenter attempted vainly to introduce the girl to some of his friends . The confusion was too great . The foreign element crowded in and would not be denied , and their acclaim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his partner responded somewhat coldly to the plaudits of her admirers . She eyed them as though not a little amused and also just a bit disdainful . As soon as was decently possible , he led her to Mrs. Redmond , whom he saw beckoning from the doorway . Together they finally eluded the curious and escaped to the big portico . It has been an interesting evening , Mr. Carpenter , ' cried the girl as she stood ready to leave ; if our trip to-morrow is one half as interesting , I sha n't want to leave this country at all . ' Then we 'll have to take particular pains to see that it is , ' replied Carpenter . Good-night ! ' He watched them as they ran down the walk and got into the Redmonds ' big car . When the headlights flashed on and it roared away up the road , he turned back toward the sound of the dance . So , we 're too unconventional and uncouth to suit your taste , young lady , ' he murmured .  | CHAPTER VI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about through the cave ground to the south of the village of Taconite . At the wheel sat Carpenter , his eyes intent on the narrow way , though occasionally cast for the briefest second toward the seat at his right , where Blanche Brundage struggled with a green silk scarf and laughed at the cuffing of the wind about her ears . This is glorious ! ' she cried , as she inhaled deeply of the pungent Northern air ; it 's really worth getting up so early for . ' I suppose , ' laughed Carpenter , that having to get up early is the one thing you 'll remember about your trip to the Range . ' Not at all , ' replied the girl . Think of the things I 've seen . Here it is only the second day of my visit , and yet I have seen a man race with a train , fight in the middle of the road with another man , and dance so divinely that ? well .... ' She paused . Carpenter grinned and put an extra pressure on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a great snowshoe rabbit . My masculine demand for recognition is appeased , ' he chuckled . Consider yourself absolved of all further obligations . ' They swung wide about the end of a great red stockpile and swept into the small yard of the mine  | office , stopping with their front wheels almost touching a tremendous gray cat which sat blinking sleepily in the bright sunlight . Hi , you , Plumbob , ' shouted Carpenter , jumping out of the car ; had one of your hard nights ? ' As he rounded the front of the car to assist the girl , he reached down and caught up the big tom with both hands . Holding the animal against his chest , he proceeded to cuff it vigorously about the head . He was instantly rewarded with sharp bites on his fingers , several of which drew blood . Ah , ha ! ' he cried ; you 're crabby this morning , you sour-tempered old night hawk ? well , then , it 's the air for yours . ' With a sudden heave he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The throw was perfectly timed , having been often rehearsed , so that the big cat dropped softly onto the roof of the second story , where it immediately curled up and resumed its interrupted nap in the solar warmth . The girl allowed Carpenter to assist her from the car with a slow smile and puckered brows . You 're the queerest man I ever met , ' she said . I never know what you 'll do next . ' Carpenter laughed heartily at her seriousness and took her by the arm . It had amused him to see how her eyes widened with astonishment as he roughed the office pet . Come on , ' he said ; you have n't seen anything yet . Wait till you see Belch Fogardy caressing some lazy bohunk with a number twelve shoepack . Here 's a pair of jumpers  --  go in Gramp 's office there and put  | them on , and then we 'll light out for the bottom of the Salmon . ' Ten minutes later , they stood on the first ladder landing at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of color and activity . The great excavation lying before them was nearly a mile in circumference . Its sides were rough and precipitous , and they descended for several hundred feet nearly straight down . The north wall of this gigantic hole was bathed in a flood of brilliant sunshine , and the girl noticed , even before Carpenter pointed it out , the line where the top soil or stripping stopped and the iron ore began . The contrast between the yellow top soil and the rich vermilion ore was startlingly clear . Far down , the bright reds faded to browns and purples , with here and there a streak of gray . On the opposite side of the pit a huge hill of yellow earth climbed in a long straight slant against the sky . Its highest point was a good two miles away , and , as she looked , a tiny train crept its length in clear-cut silhouette and an avalanche of light-colored stripping cascaded from the side-dump cars . A cloud of feathery vapor burst from the distant engine and many seconds later the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is magnificent ! ' cried the girl . I never imagined that the mines were as big as this . ' Her wide eyes dropped from the far horizon to the teeming depths at her feet and lifted again to the man at her side . He , too , was looking into the great hollow and there was an exultation in his face which she had never seen before in a man 's expression . Great stuff , is n't it ? ' he growled . It 's the great-  | est thing I 've ever known , at least . It makes you want to jump into it in some way and become a part of it . ' As he stood leaning against the wood railing in high boots , flannel shirt , and wide-brimmed Stetson , he presented an heroic figure . His face was browned by sun and wind and his strong corded hands rested heavily on the seasoned top rail . The girl suddenly found herself caught up in his enthusiasm and she felt an inexplicable longing to share his delight in the wonder of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and patted his large one . Let 's go down inside now . I want to see what it 's like down there . ' They descended four flights of wooden stairs to the top of the ladderway proper . From this point a narrow iron-runged ladder dropped to the floor of the pit . The girl looked down in dismay . Raising her eyes , she discovered Carpenter smiling at her evident perturbation . The stair stops here ! ' she cried ; do I have to climb down that awful ladder ? ' Surest thing you know , ' grinned Carpenter ; it is n't bad if you keep your eyes partly shut and only look at the ladder and under no circumstances below you. , He was about to lead off when a shrill whistling burst forth . The warning came as a series of quick staccato blasts rather than a continuous blowing . Presently another whistle joined in and then another and another , until the pit was filled with a shrill reverberation that echoed and reechoed between the  | sheer walls of the excavation . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Bedlam had suddenly been turned loose and she involuntarily clutched Carpenter 's arm . Good Heavens ! what is it ? ' she cried . He drew her to the railing and they looked down from their eagle 's nest into the clamor beneath . Going to blast , ' he shouted in her ear . All the steam shovels and engines whistle like that to warn the miners to take cover . See those two men stepping around so carefully amongst those big boulders over there ? That 's where the dynamite is ; they are touching off the fuses now . ' From their position on the ladderway they could see the floor of the pit with much greater distinctness than from the rim of the excavation above . Twisting tracks seemed to run everywhere across the carpet of red ore . Here and there a panoply of steam indicated the presence of a shovel . Trains of short stubby cars lurched along behind dumpy hump-backed dinkies ? miniature locomotives which had no tenders . To their right an inclined skipway of heavy timbering clung to the pit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below in a black hole in the floor of the pit . Black iron pipe lines ran from point to point , tracing zigzag patterns up the first few benches . Piles of cross-ties and rails , coal and planks and kegs , littered the area immediately beneath them . Everywhere men were running . Following individuals with her eyes , the girl saw that one by one they dropped down behind the various piles of stores or climbed beneath the shovels themselves . She looked for the big  | boulders that Carpenter had pointed out . The two miners were leaning down as they scrambled about , and she noticed that they carried tiny brass lamps in their hands , the yellow flames of which could just be distinguished . Lazy curls of blue smoke arose at many points behind them . The men straightened up , jumped to the near-by tracks , and began running across the ties away from the pile of boulders . They reached a string of steel cars and dropped down behind them . She could see that they were lighting their pipes with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and the sudden silence that sueceeded " the shrill whistling held something of menace in its intangible weight . A distinct suspense was in the air that even the bright sunlight failed to dispel . Carpenter held the girl 's arm a bit tighter . Do n't be frightened , ' he whispered ; there is no danger up here . We are too far away and too high above the floor for anything to reach us . ' Suddenly the entire pit seemed to dissolve itself into its atomic particles . There was a sharp snap ? a shock , as it were , that could be seen and felt but not heard , and this was followed by a heavier shock and a tremendous thump that nearly burst the ear drums . No sooner had this first detonation expended itself than a second shook the pit and then a third and a fourth . The girl watched huge boulders fall apart and roll over in halves and followed smaller fragments with her eyes as they bounded across the floor of the pit . Little spurts of dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragments had been hurled , and in  | fascinated amazement she beheld one huge mass of rock rise high in the air , turning slowly over and over . After the twelfth blast there came a lull and she removed her fingers from her ears . Is it all over ? ' she asked , and her voice sounded futile and insignificant following the roar of sound that had filled the rocky cauldron a moment before . Not yet , ' replied Carpenter ; they have n't signaled . ' For perhaps three seconds , which to the girl 's strung nerves seemed as many minutes , all was quiet . The miners remained in hiding and nothing moved except the heavy clouds of yellow smoke that overhung the location of the blasting . Then once more the air rocked , this time to two blasts of even greater force than those preceding . The wood flooring on which they stood quivered and loose stones rattled past them into the abyss . A single , long shrill from a shovel whistle floated through the air and a medley of shouts arose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appearance of an angry anthill , hundreds of men springing into sight as though by magic . All clear , ' smiled Carpenter ; let 's go . ' He dropped through the rectangular hatchway in the platform and paused with his eyes on a level with the top rung . Come on , ' he urged ; this is n't half as bad as it looks . ' The girl adjusted the heavy , buckskin gloves that he had given her and placed one foot gingerly on the first rung . Encouraged by his smile and quiet voice ,  | she stepped off the landing and with his hand to guide her feet began the long descent . Mindful of the directions she had received , she kept her eyes on the ladder and felt her nervousness gradually disappear . Halfway down , the wall of the pit receded so as to leave the ladder held out in mid-air on struts braced against the rock . Between struts the ladder gained considerable elasticity and it waved back and forth beneath their combined weights . Forgetting her instructions , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At once a paralysis of fright took possession of her . She grew weak and faint . Her muscles seemed to lose their strength , and she realized that she was going to fall . With a little cry she crumpled and slid into the arms of the man beneath her . Carpenter was not altogether unprepared for this contingency , although he had not counted on a complete collapse . Luckily he was looking up as her will power fled and thus received some warning of what impended . Taking two quick jumps up the ladder , he broke her fall with his body and held her tightly against the iron . Swinging his left leg around a side rail , he locked his foot under a rung ; then , gripping another with his left hand , he clasped her firmly about the waist with his right arm . He waited until the ladder ceased its bouncing before he unlocked his left leg . When he did disengage it , he began a slow but steady descent that brought them safely to the floor of the pit . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvised mattress of mackinaws . Several  | miners were standing near with their tools still in their hands . Carpenter was kneeling beside her and patted her hand as she attempted to sit up . Take it easy , ' he cautioned ; there 's plenty of time . ' She tried to regain her usual poise and even went so far as to frown at the gaping hunkies , but the effort was not instantaneously successful . She felt helpless and rather insignificant for the first time in her life . Ordinarily most independent , she discovered that it was a great comfort to have some one concerned in her welfare ? as the man bending over her most evidently was . He offered no excuses , but she saw that his fine eyes were clouded with anxiety , and he was very gentle as he helped her to her feet a few moments later . A man emerged from a small shanty near at hand and ran to them with a tin cup full of steaming coffee . As rapidly as she could , without scalding her tongue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage revive . There was a kick to that coffee that could hardly be accounted for by mere strength of boiling . After the last sip , she looked up and smiled at the man who had served as messenger . His features were probably as unprepossessing as any she had ever beheld , but there was a warmth in his blue eyes that she recognized and appreciated . Are you Mr. ? Mr. Belch ? ' she asked . The men standing about her burst into a roar of laughter , partly through relief at the evidence of her recovery and partly at the incongruity of such a name on the lips of this fair girl . Not least amongst those who gave free rein to their mirth was Fogardy.  | I am thot , ' he bellowed , removing his dented derby ; an ' f'how tha ? f'how did yez know it was me , now ? ' Oh , I 've heard of you before , ' she smiled ; you 're a good friend of Mr. Carpenter 's , I understand . ' Here she struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference to his friendship with Carpenter was repellent to him , as , indeed , it was to Carpenter . When men enjoy a comradeship that has ripened with years and long association , they feel the bond too deeply to like to have it spoken about . The Irishman 's gaze swept the pit in a rapid search for something with which to change the subject . Two of his track crew stood grinning at the turn of the conversation . That these men had sacrificed the coats off their backs to make the girl more comfortable in no wise influenced Fogardy as he swung on them with a ferocity which was the more intense because of his momentary discomfiture . Great slapin ' Jasus ! ' he roared ; f'what in tha name av sivin hells are yez two lazy sons av drunken bums shtandin ' here for ! Take yoor coats , yez smirken Walter Rollies , and bate it up tha thrack or I 'll put tha fear of God in tha sates av yoor pants . ' The men hustled away , struggling into their mackinaws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hat back over his eyes as he did so . They must av thought they was ladies-in-waitin ' , ' he growled , shtandin ' around with silly grins on their ugly mugs instid av with picks in their clumsy fingurs. '  | The girl was about to make some comment when she was interrupted by the arrival of a fourth party . It was Hankins . He was immaculately clad in flannel shirt , whipcord riding-breeches , and extra high leather boots . He balanced a tripod and transit over his shoulder . Good-morning , Bryan , ' he greeted Carpenter . ' I wanted to speak to you about that survey we were thinking of making of the Blanche Mine . ' Thoroughly disgusted with the fellow 's brass , Carpenter introduced him to Miss Brundage . They talked on general topics for several minutes , to the exclusion of Fogardy , who had fallen silent with the advent of the verbose engineer . Hankins was almost servile in his effort to ingratiate himself with the Eastern girl , and both the other men were astonished to note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine did you say you were going to survey ? ' she asked . The Blanche ' ? Hankins waved his arm toward the adjoining property ; it used to be one of our holdings , but it has fallen into other hands and has lately been renamed ? very handsomely , if I may say so . ' Carpenter expected the voluble chump to be properly squelched for this last sally , but the girl only eyed him with amusement , and suggested that they all inspect the workings together , as she now felt entirely herself . As they moved along , she marvelled at the activity apparent on every hand . Great shovels coughed and rocked as they bit into the red hematite . Ear-split-  | ting screeches filled the air as steel dipper teeth grated over the rock sides of buried boulders . Trains of cars lurched along over roughly laid tracks and staggered up impossible grades . Some of the locomotives hauling these trains were different from any she had ever heard of before . They had cylinders mounted vertically on the sides of their boilers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lateral crankshaft . The gear ratio of these engines was so low that when they approximated even a moderate speed their exhaust roared as though they were traveling sixty miles an hour . At regular intervals a skip loaded with ore emerged from the pocket at the foot of the inclined shaft and crept steadily up the long runway . Halfway to the top , this skip was passed by another which was empty and descended as the former ascended . These alternated skips were on the same cable , which wound over the big drum in the hoist-house . As the party proceeded , Hankins became more and more attentive to the girl , and his descriptions grew so romantic that Carpenter was forced to smile in spite of his annoyance . Fogardy , on the other hand , was rapidly losing his temper . Several times he indicated silently to Carpenter what his course of action would be if the matter were left to him . He accomplished this by lifting his heavy boot and wagging it suggestively back and forth , but Carpenter shook his head . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl insisted on visiting the very spot where the dynamite had been set off . She picked  | up several splinters of rock and looked at them wonderingly . She felt herself in the midst of strange and tremendous forces . It was becoming more and more difficult to maintain her pose of complete independence . She actually felt a desire to have some one lead her by the hand . For Hankins she already felt a large measure of contempt , but he fairly groveled at her feet , and she clutched eagerly at this straw , which helped to sustain her . Without this homage to her sex , she felt that she would be entirely eclipsed by the powers about her . They were standing in the middle of the track and Hankins was describing the action of a pneumatic jack-hammer when a pressure on her arm caused her to look up . Carpenter motioned up the track and she observed an ore train bearing down upon them . He helped her to the edge of the ditch out of harm 's way . Hankins followed suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , facing the tracks . Fogardy , who had hardly said a word in the past twenty minutes , stood between the rails filling his pipe . He appeared to be quite unconscious of the approaching train . Look out , Mr. Fogardy , ' sang out the girl ; look out , or you 'll get run over . ' Carpenter watched the track boss in some surprise . Belch was too old a hand to be caught napping on the tracks and he was n't in the habit of taking foolish chances . He still remained in his absent-minded attitude when the first rumbling car was but a few yards distant . Simultaneously , Carpenter and Hankins shouted a warning .  | The Irishman looked up as though for the first time sensing his danger , which , as a matter of fact , was critical , for the rolling axles were nearly upon him . With a hoarse cry he sprang clear of the train , twisting in the air like a cat , and landed rear end to against the slender form of the engineer . Hankins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell over the edge of the steep bank . The drop was about six feet and he lit squarely on his back in the middle of the cold , red stream . Carpenter and the girl had a momentary vision of a wide-open mouth and frantic eyes before the opaque waters closed over the struggling form and left only two legs sticking up into the frosty morning . While Carpenter was still digesting the significance of things , Fogardy jumped down the bank and waded in nearly to his waist . Hankins was just emerging for air when the Irishman reached him . I 'll save yez ! ' shouted that worthy in a stentorian voice , and , grasping a handful of the engineer 's hair , he heaved him to his feet . Sure an ' it 's a lucky thing for my family that yez hollered whin yez did , young fella , for which I 'm axtendin ' thanks at this toime , but f'how in tha wurruld did yez come to fall in here ? ' Hankins shook the Irishman off and clambered out on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , but fire lurked in his sullen eyes as he picked up the sodden hat that the track boss tossed him , after first inadvertently stepping on it in effecting its rescue . Carpenter noticed that he was beginning to shiver and told him to report to the Company doctor  | as soon as he could reach the surface and change his clothes . Hankins slunk away , dripping like a leaky umbrella . Knowing that it would be futile to attempt to reprove his track foreman , Carpenter gave way to his feelings and , sitting down on a convenient rail , laughed until the tears rolled out of his eyes . Eventually he apologized to the dumfounded girl , and they continued their walk along the floor of the pit . Fogardy left them with the excuse that his presence was demanded in another part of the pit , but Carpenter knew that the Irishman would seek the nearest shovel and regale its crew with a lurid account of the late accident . As he reflected on the ingenious deviltry of the deed , he again burst into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow 's fall ? ' asked the girl . Really , I find you men up here the most hard-hearted souls imaginable . ' There was a serious strain in her voice that reminded Carpenter that she was unused to such incidents and probably was judging him according to her Eastern standards of decorum . Hankins will be all right , ' he explained ; he should n't mind a bit of a ducking on a fine day like this . ' The girl thought of the thin edging of ice she had noticed along the side of the ditch and shivered involuntarily . Did men actually go through such experiences and live to tell about it afterward ? She remembered a certain week-end party in the Adirondacks when one of the younger men had broken  | through a skating pond . He had been rushed to the hotel and given emergency treatment by the house physician , and the entire party had waited about downstairs for hours until they were assured that the youth would recover . Yet here , right before her eyes , two men had been soaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principals , and one of these not overmuch . She looked at Carpenter with a light of growing understanding in her eyes . She was encountering several masculine traits which evidently were peculiar to the type of men represented by her host . She tried to imagine several of her men friends in Carpenter 's position , but realized that they would not fit . They had many accomplishments , many in fact that he had given no evidence of possessing , but beside him they would appear soft and effeminate.  | CHAPTER VII CARPENTER and Blanche Brundage approached the mining office hand in hand . They had just stepped from one of the skips that hoisted ore from the floor of the pit . A general rule forbade the use of the incline for transporting people , but Carpenter had made a special case of this instance , for he had not wished to exhaust the girl nor subject her again to the perils of the ladderway . He had called the hoist engineer by telephone from the pocket and explained the situation . A few moments later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only their heads visible above the strap-iron rim . The skip tender gave the slow-speed hoist signal and their ponderous vehicle had begun its oblique rise to the surface . As the steel rollers clicked metallically over the guide ends , Carpenter and the girl leaned back in luxurious ease . Because of the vertical angle of the incline they seemed to be half-reclining and halfstanding . To the girl it seemed as though they were constantly falling over backward . Looking straight ahead , their gaze lost itself in the steel blue of a cloudless sky . Their backs were resting on the iron-plate back of the bucket and their feet were cushioned on damp red ore that was too sticky to fall away when the main loads were dumped on the headframe above . All at once the situation struck the girl as being humorous and she broke into soft laughter . Whoever would have thought a month ago that I  | should be here now , ' she marveled ? lying almost on my back in a dirty iron bin , being dragged up a hill by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ? he 'd be horrified . ' Carpenter looked down at her with mingled amusement and admiration . His right arm was beneath her shoulders to protect her from the sharp metal angle of the rim . She had removed her hat and the mass of red-gold hair that it had hidden lay lightly on his shoulder . As she glanced up at him , he thought that he had never seen a daintier or more beautiful woman . His gaze was so direct that she blushed slightly and looked away . This is a most unconventional pose , ' she protested ; do you entertain many of your lady friends this way ? say on Sunday afternoons ? ' Hardly ; it 's a bit too expensive . ' But you would if it were n't so expensive ? ' Perhaps ? I find it has possibilities . ' For instance ? ' she queried , looking up at him with provocative bravado . This , ' he whispered huskily , yielding to an irresistible impulse , and he swept her to him with a sudden passion that left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crushed against his breast , he ran his free hand through the silky hair that curled about her temples and leaned down to the petulant lips so exquisitely parted at the moment . For many seconds he held her and she felt the strength of his arms and chest where the muscles quivered beneath his flannel shirt . Then he let her go , slowly and reluctantly . She quailed beneath the fire that danced in the blue  | eyes above her . While she still fought against a delightful panic that sent the blood pounding through her ears , the skip stopped with a jerk and a man 's voice called out from just overhead . Carpenter clambered out and lifted her to the ground . Her one hundred and eighteen pounds seemed to be no more than a child 's weight in his strong hands . He said no word , but retained his grasp of one of her hands as they walked toward the office , nor did she attempt to withdraw her fingers . Where was her pride ? She wondered , with a certain amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances , had they occurred in a drawing-room , seemed inappropriate here , and she realized , too , that the pressure of his fingers was not altogether distasteful to her . As they rounded the corner of the office , they both stopped short in surprise . Drawn up beside the steps was the car that her father had chartered in Duluth and about it were grouped several men engaged in a heated dispute . They broke off as the man and the girl burst on them and gazed in surprise at the equally surprised couple . Blanche ran forward with a cry of welcome and grasped her father 's arm . Hello , Dad ! ' she cried . I did n't expect that you would call for me . Good-morning , Mr. McKinlock . ' Carpenter took in the situation through narrowed lids . Two strangers besides the girl 's father and McKinlock sat in the hired car and , unless he were badly mistaken , one of these was the man Koranski , of whom he had heard no good . Old Dan Armitage stood before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument had been between these two . Hankins stood on the office steps and found it easy to forget the matter in hand long enough to smile a greeting to the girl . He had changed his clothing and now appeared in his street garments . They were more appropriate to his particular style than the engineer 's garb that had accompanied him into the ditch . McKinlock 's face was drawn and pale , as though he were still sick from the blow received on the day before . As Carpenter approached , Mr. Brundage opened the car door and motioned to his daughter to get in . She pointed to her suit of jumpers and , running into the office , hurriedly removed them . Returning outside , she took her place in the waiting car . Sensing a surcharged atmosphere , she attempted no introductions . McKinlock and her father followed her into the car , and at a word from the former the driver backed across the cinders and found room to head for the gate . As they pulled away , the two men nodded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became but a speck on the road and at last turned out of sight , the youth turned to the old miner . ' Why the formal call , Gramp ? ' The old man spat disgustedly and motioned toward the office . Come on in , an ' I 'll tell ye . ' As they filed into the office , Hankins followed close on their heels and took a chair near the old miner 's . Carpenter 's eyes smouldered and his lip curled in disgust . The fellow 's gall was becoming insufferable . I called McKinlock on the ' phone this morning , '  | began Armitage , leaning back in his swivel chair , and suggested that it was time we made a survey of his workin 's along our property line . He was agreeable until I said that you and Hankins here would make the survey . He put his foot down flat , and said that he would n't allow you on his property . I tried to stick to my point that you , as part owner , was entitled to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hankins or any other engineer we wanted to send over could check every day if we so desired , but that you was absolutely out of the picture . He even offered to have their swamper help Hankins out if we were short of help , but stated that you 'd be throwed off the place if you set foot on it . They 're takin ' out a powerful lot of ore lately , ' he continued , and there 's lots more of it that looks like Bessemer than I ever imagined they 'd find . ' Carpenter got up and wandered to the window , whence he could look across one corner of the Salmon to the adjoining property . After a few moments , during which there was silence , he walked to a metal cabinet and , rummaging about , unearthed a pair of binoculars . Returning to the window , he spent several minutes with the glasses focussed on the Blanche . From time to time he consulted his watch . They are hoisting at peak capacity , ' he said at last , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wish we had a sample , ' grumbled Armitage , and I 'd have it analyzed , pronto . I 'd hate to ask ' em for one , though ; it would look as though we distrusted ' em , especially as they 'd offer us their own analysis instead of a sample . '  | I think I 'll go over and get one to-night , ' mused the younger man aloud . I 'll wait till after dark and then slip down there from the Lone Jack and pick from the last car south of the pocket . No one over there will see me , for it wo n't take more than twenty minutes and the light under the pocket wo n't light up anything more than a hundred feet from the shaft . ' The old miner demurred at this , but the youth laughed off his objections , pointing out that no risk was involved and that the information thus obtained would assure them that all was well or that it was high time that they made an investigation . He put away the glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and recheck those figures we were looking at this morning . When you come down from lunch , have Mrs. Gloster send along a couple of sandwiches , will you ? ' For the next two hours he worked uninterruptedly . At one o'clock Armitage returned from dinner and brought along a dinner bucket heavy with hot coffee , sandwiches , rolls , and pie . After dispatching these , Carpenter talked at length to the older man of his trip East . The two of them smoked in serene contentment until Old Dan was called below . Carpenter had just crawled onto his drafting-stool once more when the extension telephone at his elbow tinkled the upstairs call . He set down the tracer arm of the planimeter he was operating and picked up the receiver . Hello , ' he shouted into the mouthpiece ; this is Carpenter talking . ' A girl 's voice answered that he recognized instantly as Jean's.  | ' Hello , Bryan , ' she called in her clear , cheery voice ; ' how 's business for a change ? I called to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're having a party and you are hereby invited . Will you come ? ' Carpenter thought rapidly . Jean was evidently making the first overtures to banish their difference of the night before . He could not afford to be churlish , even though her actions had hurt him deeply , and he wanted to see her , for she stirred him strangely since his return . He could visit the Blanche , obtain the desired sample , and still reach Leba in time . ' Sure , I 'll be there , ' he called back . ' Am I to bring any one with me ? Is Miss La Barge invited this time ? ' Ile heard her laugh . Miss La Barge was a very plump , old-maid school teacher whom she had once assigned to him as a joke . The poor soul had put on every ribbon she possessed for the occasion , and then Carpenter had taken her over the highways at such a clip in the white roadster that she had arrived at the party looking a good deal like a plucked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her equanimity and had accomplished it only in time to return to Taconite at the same breakneck speed . She required several days to regain her composure and had recounted the adventure so many times in the ensuing few weeks that Carpenter heard about it from the whole town . ' Not this time , ' Jean answered . ' I have something I want to say to you , myself . You are to bring that young engineer of yours , though ? Arnold Hankins . Will you do that ? I 've already told him that you  | would , in fact . He has never been out here and is bringing Susie Lahti . She 's thrilled to death to think that she 's to ride out between the two of you . She told Molly O'Neil so to-day . You do n't mind , do you , Bryan ? I hate to ask them to ride out on the bus ? ' Carpenter swallowed the words that rose to his lips and smiled foolishly . Ile knew Jean . Generous to a fault herself , she expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time that he had suddenly discovered that his social obligations were so and so , and had been all arranged for days before he knew anything about them . But Hankins ? of all people ? and that silly Lahti girl ! No , I do n't mind , ' he lied ; I 'm delighted . What time shall we come out ? I may have to be a little late . ' Oh , any time after eight ? you 're a good boy , Bryan ? ' bye . ' He heard the telephone click at the other end and hung up his receiver . What a pleasant evening he was going to have ! He wanted to talk with Jean , but he did n't see how he was going to get in a word with a party overrunning the place . With a groan of resignation he bent again over the blue-prints . At five-thirty , when the quitting whistles were blowing for the surface crews , he slipped his slide rule into its leather case and climbed down from the uncomfortable stool . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small of his back , he put away the prints and the planimeter and , grabbing his hat , jumped down the stairs and walked out of the office .  | To Carpenter there was a sincere pleasure in doing soy kind of engineering work . He thoroughly enjoyed even the monotonous detail of long computations . When the final figures were obtained , that were to influence or decide an important decision , he experienced the same personal exultation that the artist derives from his completed picture . As he strode along over the weathered boards that rattled underfoot , he felt singularly at peace with the world . The sun had almost dropped over the rim of the hills to the west and a hazy glow illuminated the entire countryside . The air was clean and fresh , with a hint of evening coolness . Cattle grazed in the boulder-strewn meadows that lay scattered between the mines , and the restful tinkle of their bells lent added peacefulness to the picture . To his left a long line of miners straggled toward the town . They trod a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore their underground hats on which the carbide lights were still alight . Hoisting had stopped temporarily , and the tall steel headframes rose against the evening sky , eloquent monuments to the day 's labor performed far below the surface . Carpenter drank deep of the heart-gladdening serenity on every hand . Of all the seasons in this country , early fall was the most delightful . As he crossed the main street of the village , he was joined by another of Mrs. Gloster 's boarders and they climbed the long hill together . His companion was a garage man , and as they worked their way upward he relieved himself of some late news . Heard about the fires south of here ? ' he asked  | Carpenter . They 're pretty bad and getting worse all the time , I understand . Fellow came in over the Miller Trunk this morning who claimed the country down around Cloquet has already gone up in smoke . Said that six hours would leave the road impassable to autos . Of course , we wo n't be bothered up here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was aroused by the man 's words , for he was fully aware of the tremendous proportions that such forest fires occasionally assumed . He had helped to fight a fire many years before , and his recollection of the waste and destruction it had occasioned still gave him nightmares . Are n't there any rangers in that section ? ' he asked . Sure , there are rangers , but what can they do with a few hundred tourists building camp-fires every night and running away in their cars every time that a brush fire gets away from them . Say , we wo n't have any timber left up here in a few years , what with the fires burning it up and the tourists chopping it down to make Boy Scout lean-tos . Did you ever notice the cars going south along toward the end of the vacation season ? Every car with an Iowa license on it has an evergreen tree strapped to the running board . ' Arriving at their destination , they surprised Armitage out in the side driveway playing a hose on the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Carpenter , with suspicion . He knew the answer before it was given .  | ' Why , they tell me you are taking a crowd to Leba to-night , ' grunted the old miner , and as I 've spattered her up a good bit , I thought she ought to have a bath . What I ca n't understand is how in the world we ever came to let that Chicago salesman sell us on a white finish . ' Who tells you that I 'm taking a crowd to Leba to-night ? ' ' Everybody . I met that Miss Lahti in Virginia today and she told me first . Since then I 've been informed of the fact no less than a dozen times . Even young Hankins said so . ' Carpenter tramped into the house through the back door . Passing through the kitchen , he encountered his landlady . Much to the amusement of the girl cooks , he promptly picked the lady up off the floor and walked into the dining-room with her . It was a feat of strength that few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lady in question . When he let her down on a chair in a state of hysteria. , because she was unaware that the big yellow cat which had last occupied it had jumped at the last moment , she took him severely to task . ' Not that it 's any of my business , Bryan Carpenter , but I hear that you 're engaged to some Eastern girl who is worth a million and who is as blonde as the gold her father is supposed to have hoarded up for the first young son-in-law to crash the family gates . Is there any truth in that ? ' ' As usual there is not . Who told you that ? ' ' Who ? Say , every girl in town knows twice as much about it as you do . It 's all that I 've heard since they  | came in from school . They say that from the way you danced last night you must have known each other for years . It 's also common gossip that you took the young lady sight-seeing and carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw up his hands . How do they find it all out ? Not that it 's true ? the first part ; but I ca n't imagine how it gets around so fast . If I dragged you upstairs and murdered you right now , before I could get down again and call the police to tell them how naughty I 'd been , they 'd know all about it and ask me why I strangled you instead of shooting you to death . ' After the evening meal , during which there was much whispering and suppressed giggling , Carpenter cornered Old Dan and outlined a plan whereby the party at Leba would not interfere with his visit to the McKinlock property . The old miner shook his head , but eventually agreed to the arrangements . A little later he took his hat and went off down the hill in the direction of town . Carpenter seated himself on the porch swing in the sun room and shortly was joined by Miss Susie Lahti , who came down attired in her best and without hesitation appropriated the remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a story of her uncle and aunt , who were acrobats , when Hankins turned in at the front gate and with characteristic shyness greeted his partner of the evening with a whoop that rattled the windows . Simultaneously with his colorful advent upon the quiet and peace of the post-supper hour there came the interestpricking tingle of the telephone . Some one risked a  | few limbs , more or less , in successfully reaching the instrument first and announced that the call was for Mr. Carpenter . IIe answered the summons with alacrity and returned to the porch with the information that he had to visit the mine and would reach the party somewhat later than he had intended . Smiling at their downcast expressions , he assured Hankins and Miss Lahti that they would be taken care of , as Dan Armitage would be glad to drive them to Leba , and bring the car back to the Salmon for him . As it was nearly eight , Carpenter suggested that they be on their way and led them to the white car at the curb . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat pulpy form into the green leather cushions . It was quite dark , and Carpenter snapped on the headlights as he started the motor . With a sudden inspiration he switched on the powerful spotlight and swung its white shaft over the second story of the boarding-house . In every window two or three half-dressed girls could be seen diving for cover . At the foot of the hill they stopped at the drug store and picked up Armitage , who took Carpenter 's place at the wheel . Then with Bryan standing on the running board , they picked up speed and headed east down the main street . Let me off at the Black Location ! ' shouted Carpenter . I 'll walk down from there . ' He turned toward the outline of the girl who almost obliterated the form of Mr. Hankins . Tell Jean that I 'll be along in about three quarters of an hour , will you ?  | It wo n't take me long to do the work that I have , and then I 'll take Mr. Armitage uptown and scoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlined group of houses and Carpenter dropped into the darkness . Without waiting to see the car out of sight , he jumped the ditch at the edge of the highway and plunged through some low bushes . Crawling under a barbed-wire fence , he struck off along a faint path which led to the shaft of the old Leopold , now called the Blanche . Funny thing , ' he mused as he picked his way over the rough ground , Hankins did n't have a word to say to-night . He knows where I 'm bound for , too ? it 's a wonder he did n't blatt out a few of his wellchosen observations for Susie 's benefit . '  | CHAPTER VIII AFTER Jean DeVoe hung up the receiver , following her call to Bryan Carpenter , she sat for many minutes with her soft chin supported in her hand . She was thinking of her late playmate who had grown up with such surprising suddenness . Totally unconscious of her own maturity , she resented the change which had occurred in him , even though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , awkward boy he had developed into a strong man almost overnight . The self-reliance that he had always possessed , and his deep-rooted independence , he still retained ; in fact , these qualities seemed to be even more pronounced than before . She realized , too , that a new element was present in his make-up , of which she had been conscious the evening before . When he had come to take her to the dance , he had recognized and saluted her sex for the first time . Always , hitherto , their relations had been those of brother and sister , and often those of brother and brother . She sensed vaguely that this relationship would never exist again . She had known when his steady eyes appraised her full , young figure and there had been a sureness in his touch that had somewhat awed her . She bowed to a feeling of keen regret at the thought that their former status had been replaced by a subtle force that she appreciated , but hesitated to explain , even to herself . She thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them because of her hints about Swede . As she sat on the sofa , with the after-  | noon sun falling in oval splotches over the gay cretonne covering , the accusation seemed far-fetched and entirely improbable . In her heart she felt there was no justification for it , and she regretted her quick words . Analyzing her reactions , she knew that it was her deep regard for Bryan that had led her to take the hasty stand which she now was sorry for . Although she had often laughed at his impersonal attitude toward other girls and had made sport of his inherent shyness , she realized that she had all the time been accepting him as a model of responsibility and trustworthiness . When she inadvertently overheard remarks which shattered this image , it had hurt her terribly . Although he had never been her ideal of a lover , still she admitted to herself that she had always considered him as her own . She had grown up , hand in hand almost , with this boy , and she knew , or thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had often chided him for being the model boy of the village , and had secretly wished he would do something startlingly unexpected and wrong , or at least daring and heroic , but she had never counted on the possibility of any other woman being in any way involved in his transgressions . Because she really cared , therefore , she had been more hurt than angry and had not been able to restrain her reproaches . She wished him to suffer a bit as she had suffered , even though he might be entirely innocent . As it was , the very thought that there might be a partial truth in the unhappy phrases that had burned her heart was unbearable .  | If she had only asked him a direct question ! She knew that if she had he would have given her a fair answer . Courage in meeting squarely matters like this was one of his strongest traits . Whether he was innocent or not , she was sure that he would have answered truthfully any direct question which she might have put to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wanted was to hear him disclaim the charge without the agony of suspense on her part that would precede a determination to ask him outright . So she had approached the matter in the worst way possible by making an insinuation ? the one sure means of antagonizing his straight-thinking sense of fairness . Consequently she had learned nothing , save that he still possessed the sensitiveness and pride that had marked him as a boy . In calling him so soon after their misunderstanding , she wanted him to guess that she repented of her actions and , furthermore , she intended to make a full confession of the entire matter as soon as she could find a moment to speak to him alone . She felt that such an opportunity would show itself even with many others at the house , and she wanted these others to be there because it would make the matter much easier than if she attempted things while they were entirely alone . It would be much easier . The previous evening she had been less sure of herself than ever before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation which might arise . Although she knew that she did not love him , still his presence had caused her many disturbing emotions since his return , not the least of which she had sensed during  | his dance with the blonde beauty from the East . How wonderfully he had danced with her ! She wondered where he had learned that perfection of movement and with whom as a partner . In fact she regretted not having danced with him herself ? an omission she was fair-minded enough to assign to her own actions . She wondered when the blonde girl would be returning East again and in her heart hoped that it would be soon . During the rest of the afternoon she busied herself about the house , making such simple preparations as she had planned , and along toward evening took her father 's car and drove to Taconite to pick out some candies and favors . As she stood at Dad Bloodsoe 's notion counter , shielded from a part of the store by a huge pyramid of dental cream , she suddenly became conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of the teachers who roomed at Mrs. Gloster 's . One of these was relating the current news in a confidential undertone that was quite audible . The other was gasping out words of horror , astonishment , and incredulity . She caught scraps of the conversation ... carried her every chance he got ... holding her around the waist and whispering to her ... her old man made her get in the car ... They say that she followed him out here ... pretty thick down East ... To-night 's the last chance Bryan 's got to see her ... ' At this point there was a silence and then Jean heard deliberate footsteps moving across the floor and a new voice which she recognized as Mrs. Gloster 's . It 's none of my business , ' said the landlady , but  | I hate to hear two empty-headed schoolmarms spread u lot . of nasty lies about one of my boarders . I happen tip know that about half of all you 've said has n't even any foundation for a starter , and the rest is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your little lessons instead of hacking reputations to pieces in here . Now if you do n't like what I 've said , you know what you can do about it . ' Another silence and the deliberate footsteps moved away again . Jean smiled at the irresistible aggressiveness of the loyal Mrs. Gloster , but there was a hollow feeling in her breast , induced by the gossip she had just overheard . She did not accept it at its face value , but there usually is some vestige of truth behind even malicious statements . It was with an uneasy feeling that she left the store . On the way home her father gave a lift to Frank Giovanni , a special deputy of the Salmon Mine , and she learned from him that Bryan had saved Blanche 's life , so that that part of the story , at least , was true . Bryan was evidently learning fast . His stay in the East had worked a transformation in at least one phase of his character . Her early prayers that this youth would develop a dashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she found it more disconcerting than thrilling . After the supper dishes had been cleared away , Jean and her father rolled up the rug in the long living-room and moved the victrola into one corner . They were still straightening up when a neighbor dropped in to chat with Jimmy . As she unpacked her favors and arranged the candies she had bought , she  | could overhear the conversation in the next room . For some time it revolved about mining matters , and she paid little attention to what was being said , but suddenly she caught the name McKinlock . That fellow is nobody 's fool , ' she heard the man from next door declare ; he said this evening , over at the hotel bar , that the first I.W.W. that stepped on his property to make trouble was going to get shot . Said he 'd heard that they was planning to dynamite his headframe on account of his bringing in some outside labor , but that he was planting some deputies around the place with instructions to pick off any strangers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon to come on the property by a single approach and to keep their hat lamps lit after dark . ' Jumbled voices sounded outside , and Jean rushed to the door to greet the first of her guests . She found two cars at the gate , one of which was the white roadster that belonged to Bryan Carpenter . Although she had no reasons for doing so , she feared that Bryan was not in the party . Perhaps she missed the cheery voice with which he was wont to call out a greeting Her premonition was confirmed when only two figures emerged from the white car , neither of which was his . She caught Old Dan Armitage 's gruff voice and then the roadster drove on , to turn around at the end of the street . With subdued gayety she welcomed Hankins and the others and ushered them into the house . As the evening wore on and Bryan failed to appear , Jean became increasingly uneasy . Whenever Bryan  | premised to be anywhere , only a major accident Wild prevent him from keeping his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with any degree of spontaneity at the weak repartee of her guests and several times she went to the door where she could see the main highway . But no glowing lights came speeding east from the direction of Taconite . Something unusual must have happened to keep him so long ? unless he were saying good-bye to the blonde girl . Each time that she turned to go indoors , she noticed that the night wind had grown stronger , and the last trip she made found it rushing through the branches of the trees and rattling the dry brush that thrived in the rocky ground . Far off to the south she thought that she detected a faint glow that curved in a slim segment above the horizon . They were all playing rotation pool in her father 's basement den when Jean suddenly became aware that Hankins was standing very close to her ? much closer than there seemed to be any necessity for . She moved around the end of the table and appeared to be studying her next shot . Shortly Hankins also rounded the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was somewhat amused and a bit indignant . She had taken pains to be gracious to Hankins , as he was a newcomer amongst her friends , but she was ready to resent any amorous familiarities . A moment later it was her turn to play . The only possible shot was for the fourteen ball , which was frozen on the end rail . She was about to essay a bank for the corner pocket when the engineer covered her hand with his and reaching across her shoulders grasped the end of her cue .  | Let me show you how to make this shot , Jean , ' he whispered ; if you get this ball you 'll win the game . ' As though subjected to an electric shock , she revolted against his touch . There was something sly and repulsive to her in his thin hands and fingers . She straightened up and shook off his hold on the cue , but forced herself to smile as she did so . Do n't lend me any of your skill , ' she said ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned forward and with a supple snap of her wrist attempted the difficult bank shot . The cue ball darted off the side rail and rolled over the green field . It collided with the fourteen ball at precisely the correct angle and sent it rolling into the corner pocket . Amidst a general hand-clapping she turned to place her cue in the wall rack . As her back was momentarily to the other guests , she gave Hankins a cool , scornful glance that he could hardly fail to interpret . He reddened under the contempt in her steady eyes and nervously searched his pockets for a cigarette . At that moment Jean 's mother called them all up for the luncheon spread in the dining-room . At the same time the telephone rang in the hall , and they could hear Jimmy DeVoe 's cheery salutation as he took down the receiver . Jean waited to turn out the lights and was therefore the last to leave the room . She noticed that Hankins was lagging behind the others . When they had gone up , she snapped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark form that she knew was the engineer barred her way at the door . As she  | pressed resolutely on in an attempt to crowd past him , he grasped her by the shoulders . ' Do n't do that , ' she said , pushing his arms away . She was beginning to get angry . Look here , Jean , ' began Hankins in a fatuous voice , do n't you think you and I could manage to get better acquainted ? ' No , I do n't think we could , ' she answered . Please let me go up the stairs . ' Wait just a minute , ' he urged , and moved closer . In spite of her anger , she felt like laughing at his absurd conceit . These , evidently , were the tactics that had gained for him a reputation amongst the younger teachers of an irresistible gallant . Mr. Hankins , ' she said , her usually soft voice firm and deliberate , that 's enough . We 'll have no more nonsense . You forget that your employer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me go up those stairs , please . ' There was no mistaking her earnestness and the engineer stepped back . His weak mouth screwed itself into a sneer that showed his uneven teeth in the semi-darkness . Do you know where your friend , Mr. Carpenter , is to-night ? Well , I 'll tell you . He 's late to your party because he went to visit the McKinlock mine . I think you can guess who he 's going to meet there , and he 's going to find rough going there too . McKinlock does n't like uninvited strangers sneaking around his mine . ' As Jean reached the head of the stairs , really angry by this time , she was arrested by the sound of her  | father 's voice raised to a pitch of considerable excitement . Through the light hall door it was possible to hear quite distinctly , and she caught her breath as she heard the name Carpenter . You say he was shot ? and that Doc is out of town ? Sure , I 'll be right over there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hello , hello , central ? damn this ' phone . ' There was a crash as her father hung up the receiver and she could hear him running up the front stairs . She stood with her hand at her throat and an awful fear deep in her breast . A snicker at her back caused her to whirl about in a fury . She had forgotten Hankins . Without a word she swung her strong young arm , caught him squarely across the mouth and sent him reeling down the stairs . She felt a pain in her shoulder from the shock and heard him strike heavily against the basement door before she dashed up the remaining few steps and began struggling madly into her big fur coat . Her mother stepped into the hall just as she reached for her hat and at the same moment Jimmy DeVoe came rushing down with his medical kit . To her astonished mother she cast a few words of explanation and to her father 's hasty objections she vouchsafed no reply , but her eyes were eloquent and spoke for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go with Dad ! ' she cried ; they wo n't mind . ' She dashed into the darkness in the wake of her father .  | CHAPTER IX LIEN Bryan Carpenter dropped off the running and of the white roadster , he struck away toward e headframe of the Blanche Mine with a light cart . He was never so content as when called upon or action of some sort , and this visit to the mine ormerly owned by his benefactor gave promise of volving just enough risk to make the event intersting . The night was exceptionally dark , and , although he sky did not appear to be cloudy , still the stars ere only faintly in evidence . This atmospheric condition puzzled him as he strode along the rough path and he cast his eyes aloft as often as possible in an attempt to fathom the peculiar obscurity . It was difficult at times to hold to the path , and once he walked into a tangle of low brush , invisible against the background of rolling earth and outcroppings of rock . One thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no stars were visible whatever in a patch of the sky that ran from north to south . On the east and west horizons , on the other hand , several brilliant orbs hung just above the hilltops . The path that he traversed across the cave ground rose and dipped beneath his feet . In the many years that had elapsed since the property was worked , the surface of the ground had settled to conform to the disembowelment far beneath . As he stumbled up the  | steep rises and slid into the narrow hollows , his thoughts flew back to the years of his early boyhood , when he had toiled shoulder to shoulder with the miners in their herculean tasks far below the gravel that now crunched under his feet . He pictured the dark drifts and the separate rooms where red-stained men wrestled with pick and shovel to rip away the iron-bearing ore . Looking at the tremendously distant stars , he wondered idly whether men strove at similar tasks on other planets being whirled , as the earth was whirled , by incalculable celestial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than ordinary elevation , he saw the headframe of the mine dead ahead . An arc light swung beneath it in the gusts of wind which swept through the steel struts and columns , and cast a brilliant circle of light over an area at the collar of the shaft . A little way to the north was the power plant , capped at short intervals with plumes of exhaust steam . To the southwest he could make out the lights of the Salmon . He was about to continue with his approach when he noticed a rosy glow that rimmed the southern edge of the night sky . This glow appeared to be brightest where the sky was impenetrably black . It was quite steady for seconds at a time and then would unaccountably flare up and die away . He watched it for several minutes . Wetting his finger he held it aloft , for the wind did not reach his present position with its full force , being deflected by a huge pile of stripping . As near as he could tell , it came from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; no wonder I could n't  | understand the appearance of the sky . That explains the yellowish tinge to the air this afternoon , too . ' For several seconds longer he gazed at the faint st reak of light , then buttoned his jacket and moved eitutiously ahead . Feeling in his pockets he assured himself that he had not lost the canvas sample sack and forged sample pick with which he would shortly effect his purpose . He would require the pick in order to loosen the ore , for it came to the surface with considerable moisture content and would be frozen in place . He intended to pick from the cars farthest from the headframe and these would have been standing in the chill air for hours . The real purpose in obtaining a sample of ore from the Blanche was to check up on the portion of the mine which was being worked . All ore is not the same ; in fact , samples taken from different locations in the same mine often differ very materially . Variations in the silica , manganese . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records are complete enough , it is possible , from the analysis of a sample of ore , to tell from what part of a mine it was taken . After a property has been worked for some time , mine experts on the job can tell with uncanny accuracy from just what point any given sample has been taken . The chemical analyses are reenforced in such instances with the qualities of color , weight , consistency , and impurities . The drilling records of this particular property were not as complete as might have been wished for , but such as they were , with the memory of Old Dan Armitage to supplement them , they would suffice to  | identify pretty closely , any sample of ore that might be obtained . In this manner Armitage and Carpenter would be able to determine at what point McKinlock was working . Half-formed suspicions had been in Carpenter 's mind all the afternoon . In the first place , he had never been able to reconcile his estimate of McKinlock with the purchase of the old Leopold . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself of the thought that McKinlock knew this as well as he and Old Dan knew it . In that case what motive had the operator had in making the purchase ? There was no high-grade or bessemer ore obtainable whatever , according to all the records , and Armitage also swore to this fact . Hematite is not considered of a good grade unless it runs in excess of forty-nine per cent pure iron . Ore which has a very low phosphorus content is known as bessemer ore , a grade which has a readier market than high phosphorus ores . As a rule , mine operators avoid removing any ore that runs less than a fortynine per cent analysis , although there are certain methods of treating low-grade ores to increase their commercial value . Inasmuch as there was neither bessemer ore nor a quantity of high-test ore in the property in question , it appeared that McKinlock must have some ulterior motive unless he were in truth the fool that the purchase seemed to make him out . McKinlock 's first move after acquiring the old Leopold had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Scotch marine boilers , a tremendous  | umping unit , and a new hoist engine . Next he deised a bailing skip by cutting a trapdoor in the ? ottom of an ore bucket . When this skip was lowered into the water , which rose sixty feet in the abandoned shaft , it filled through the trapdoor . Then , as soon as the skip was lifted , the weight of the water closed the trap . The device came in for much adverse criticism , but as the workings were not extensive in the old mine , it was not so impractical a move as would appear at first thought . Inside of three months , McKinlock had his pumps working in addition to these improvised bailers . Trainloads of timber were brought in and crews of carpenters pounded and hammered night and day on a new dry machine shop , chemical laboratory , and sundry trestles , fences , sheave stands , and small buildings . Inside of six months , ore was being hoisted up the shaft and the local mining men were forced to admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them would have been glad to welcome him to their midst , for the mining men of the Mesabi are a generous , free-minded clan who love and admire force and vitality , but the stranger was taciturn and overbearing and soon let it be known that he preferred his own company . After taking this stand , he was not a little astonished at the rapidity with which his selfimposed status was accepted . In one way it suited his purposes , however ; there would be no expert eyes appraising his activities . By the time Carpenter had returned to the Range , McKinlock had renamed the old Leopold the Blanche . At variance with the tenor of its name , it exuded an  | atmosphere of concentrated life and activity . The whistling exhaust of the hoist engine could be heard at all hours of the night and day . Trainload after trainload of red ore was slipped over the main-line siding and hauled away ; toward the docks on Lake Superior . At first , local men were employed , but as the work got under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those in authority were strangers to the Mesabi . They lived in a new location that was constructed on adjoining land , and it soon became known that these men were forbidden to patronize the Taconite saloons . As Carpenter drew closer to the big steel headframe , he advanced with increasing caution . The wind had continually grown stronger , and he realized that he would have to depend entirely upon his eyes to warn him of danger . The path took a last dip and rose to the level that stretched to the collar of the shaft . Coming in from the northwest , he had struck the surface workings midway between the headframe and the power house . A dozen yards more brought him opposite to cave ground and , turning aside , he dropped softly into the first depression . Traveling parallel with the path , he made his way south and west until just opposite the shaft . As the depressed ground was five or six feet below the surface , only the top of his head was visible to any one who might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a fringe of weeds and low bushes to protect him against this hazard . After making his way for some distance further , he crawled onto a half-buried boulder and raised his  | head and shoulders until he could survey the vicinity of the shaft . The lurid arc light on the headframe cast a white light that made of the spot a jumble of sharply defined shadows and illuminated areas . At short intervals he could hear the three bells which duplicated the signals of the skip tender far below . lk could hear the soft swish as the rising bucket cleared the shaft collar and rose toward the sheaves above . There would be the roar of a dumped load , the clang of metal as the skip rode over the curved guides , and then the muffled noises of its perpendicular descent . Off to his right the whining song of the hoist engine exhaust would rise on the night air . Far above , the big sheaves spun on their greased bearings as they vomited forth their endless ribbons of black cable . Only one man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that edged the cave ground . This man was the car tender . He wore overalls with the jacket tucked inside and had rubber muckers on his feet and a sou'wester on his head . He was stained from head to toe with the red ore , large splotches even adorning his features . He ran up an iron ladder as Carpenter watched and closed the radial door of the pocket by swinging his weight on the long operating lever . A string of ore cars stood on the tracks that ran beneath the headframe and the car directly under the pocket , into which the last load of hematite had poured , was now heaped to capacity . The solitary car tender walked out on a strut that overhung this car and jumped to the soft ore below him . Making  | his way to one end , he inserted a piece of pipe in the brake wheel and , using it as a lever , loosened the brake shoes . As the tracks were laid on an appreciable incline , the pull of gravity was a mighty factor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly down grade . The figure in the white mucking shoes jumped across to the following car , which was empty . When this car was directly beneath the pocket , a strong heave on the improvised lever brought the string to a halt . Jumping back up the ladder , the man put his shoulder under the long handle of the pocket door and , heaving upward , forced it open . Several thrusts with a stout pole loosened the ore and it roared down into the empty car with a clatter that shook the air . The car tender seated himself on a heavy timber . Here he would remain until the cars again had to be moved . Fearful of being apprehended by this man , Carpenter decided to remain hidden until the car tender was engaged once more in shifting his iron herd . There might be a deputy about , as well as the solitary figure on the headframe , and it would be folly to allow himself to be observed , for short shrift would be given to any one caught skulking about the premises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the level of the high ground and crawled southwards on all fours . The going was rough and he scratched his knees and hands on sharp pieces of rock , but he made first-rate progress in spite of these annoyances . Coming to a halt when he judged himself to be opposite the last car of ore , he again climbed to the high ground and lay pressed against the edge of  | the bank . It seemed an interminable time before the car under the pocket began to show signs of reaching its capacity and he was anxious to get away and join the party at Jean 's home . He held himself in check , however , and waited for the creaking of brakes that would herald his opportunity to dash across the open to the shelter of the cars . Lying at full length , he reflected on his actions of the morning . In kissing Blanche Brundage , he realized that he had yielded to a sudden impulse . The girl herself had provoked his action . She had been irresistibly attractive in the fresh brightness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as surely as though her lips had made the request . Furthermore , he had felt , and , for that matter , still felt , a sort of proprietary interest in her due to saving her from certain death when she lost consciousness on the ladderway . Attempting to analyze his feelings , Carpenter felt that he entertained a great admiration for this Eastern girl , but he could not feel that he was in any way in love with her . He respected her culture and intelligence and appreciated the taste with which everything associated with her seemed to have been selected , but he did not feel in his heart that she had stirred in him the well-springs of a grand passion . A raucous grinding of metal against metal awoke him from his reverie and he looked up to see the string of cars moving slowly down grade . Here was his chance . He jumped to his feet and vaulted onto the high ground . Casting a quick glance toward the headframe , which revealed the car tender busy at his lonesome task , he ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars . Crouching on the ends of the cross-ties , he paused for several breaths to survey his position . Nothing moved within sight , save the ore cars , which were coming to a standstill with much stuttering and complaining . Grasping a ladder rung , he swung himself off the track and a second later pitched onto the load of red hematite . As he had anticipated , the ore in this car , which had stood the longest in the chill air , was frozen to the point where a thin crust had formed on the surface . Reaching for his sample pick , he selected a likely spot and delivered half a dozen sharp blows with the steel instrument . The shell broke through and he thrust his hand into the damp ore underneath . Dropping several handfuls into the bottom of his canvas sample sack , he moved to a new spot . Within five minutes he had obtained samples of ore from a dozen different locations spread over the limits of the car . The canvas sack was filled to its neck and he drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about to descend to the ground when a slight movement caught his eye . A shadow had passed across a bright spot that lay within reach of the rays cast by the arc light . He flattened himself on the load and , heedless of his clothing , hitched his way to the edge of the car . At first he could see nothing , for he looked against the light and all else was blacker by contrast . Then he made out a figure close against the side of the car ahead . He strained his eyes as though to pierce the darkness by very will power and held his breath that he might catch the faintest sound . Detecting no further move-  | ment , he was about convinced that the dark blotch was no more than an unusually deep shadow , when it moved toward him once more . This time he could make out the figure of a man and his heart rose to his mouth . A deputy was creeping slowly but steadily along the edge of the track and vagrant rays glinted at intervals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidently wore a black hat and mackinaw , for he was almost indistinguishable . As Carpenter lay grasping the cold edge of the metal car , the deputy reached its upgrade end . As he came abreast of the coupling , Carpenter saw him look to the right and motion with his hand . A creepy sensation glided up Carpenter 's spinal column as he realized the significance of this . There was another man on the other side of the string , and they were keeping in touch with one another as they advanced . Evidently they had seen him and were expecting to find their quarry hiding at the end of the last car . When they should reach the end and find no one , as they would within a matter of seconds , their first step would be to investigate the top of the train , in which case discovery would be inevitable . For a moment Carpenter was on the verge of calling out and surrendering , for there was the gravest peril that these men would shoot first and listen to explanations afterward . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McKinlock . The story would be spread about , and it would not benefit their case if he and Old Dan had to admit that he had been caught trespassing . Furthermore , he would perforce sacrifice the ore sample and he was fully re-  | solved not to abandon this possible confirmation of his constantly growing suspicions . He reached his decision quickly , which was characteristic of him and in this instance imperative . He would risk being shot and gamble on escaping with the sample . The darkness of the night was in his favor , and it was possible that the two men were not entirely sure of his exact whereabouts . Regardless of all else , there was not a second to lose , for the deputies were by now halfway down the sides of the car . Rising to his feet , he took the iron sample pick and flung it like a bullet at the metal sheeting of a tool house down the track . A second later it struck with a loud clang . Even before the sound had reached him , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started running over the rough ore . The noise made by the sample pick would suffice to hold the attention of the two men for several moments and the night wind would prevent their hearing any slight sound resulting from his progress over the car tops . His real danger now lay in being perceived by the laborer at the pocket . He put six cars between himself and the deputies before dropping to a crouch to reconnoiter . He was not more than a hundred feet from the shaft , and he looked anxiously for the somber figure of the car tender . The man was nowhere to be seen . With a vague sense of uneasiness on this account , he dropped between the car ends and looked back along the side of the track . He was unable to distinguish the forms of the deputies amidst the dark shadows . Clambering over the couplers , he was about to jump to the ground  | on the other side when he suddenly noticed a third man standing near the edge of the cave ground . His retreat by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirthlessly ? the game was getting warm . Still clasping the sample sack , he ducked back again to the other side and , after a quick survey , left the shelter of the train . Bent nearly double , he moved toward the bulk of a huge stockpile . He would have climbed beneath the cars and crawled the length of the train , coming out at a point north of the headframe , but the light would be sure to expose him to the deputy at the edge of the cave ground . Even as it was , he must negotiate an area that was faintly illuminated by the detestable arc light . He was fifty feet from the track when he heard steps crunching on the loose ore . Glancing over his shoulder , he saw that the two men whom he had tricked were retracing their steps . Making himself as inconspicuous as possible , he pulled off his gray felt hat and stuffed it inside his coat . He would present a pretty sight to attend a party , by the time he escaped from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the track , pausing from time to time to look beneath the trucks and to survey the tops of the cars . A muffled sentence or two reached him as they crept past . The old man 'll raise hell if he finds out that somebody 's been here and slipped past us . ' You said it , boy . If you see anybody , let him have it . Nobody gives a damn about one of these hunkies up here , anyway . ' Carpenter lay frozen in immobility for several  | minutes after the men had passed out of hearing . He feared they might return while he was attempting to cross the open space that now was his chief obstacle to getting away . If he could only reach the shadows on the far side of the stockpile , he would be practically safe from detection . On all fours he moved into the open and in a few moments had successfully reached the halfway point . From the shelter of the cars , this spot had seemed to be lighted just enough to make the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed to Carpenter that he lay bathed in the flood of a searchlight . He thought that he could distinguish the markings on the small stones that lay embedded near his face and a fragment of broken glass seemed to cast a reflected light that must rival the sun for brilliancy . Feeling sure that any one who might chance to look could not avoid seeing him , he rose to his feet and made a dash for it . Five seconds would take him to safety . He had just reached the fringe of security when an excited shout came from somewhere in the sky . Other shouts answered and there came the sound of running feet . Carpenter understood then what had become of the car tender . He had climbed to the top of the headframe to act as a look out for the men below . Standing on the small platform about the cable sheaves , eighty feet in the air , he commanded a view of the entire district . The wonder was that he had not detected Carpenter before this . Now he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slope of the stockpile , to deaden the sound of his running , Carpenter sped  | along its base . He prayed fervently that no loose timbers or shovel buckets lay in his path , for he would be unable to avoid them in the inky darkness . A shot rang out behind him and far to his left he heard the bullet ricochet from the stone that chanced to deflect its course . He was rounding a wide curve , and as long as he maintained his present speed , he would be secure from the gun at his back . It was what might lie before him that caused him anxiety . At full pace he rounded the far end of the great mound of hematite and with the unexpectedness of a tropical thunderclap ran full upon a deputy , bound counterwise about its base . There was no time for thought . A wicked flash burst from the muzzle of the deputy 's rifle and Carpenter felt a hot burn under his left armpit . Then he was on top of the man . Unable to check his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicious arc and brought it down on the white square that marked the man 's face . There was no opportunity to dodge in the darkness , and he scored a direct hit . The man dropped like a log and it was all Carpenter could do to escape tripping over him . Checking his wild flight , he turned back and caught up the rifle that lay beside the inert body . He had merely time to take a few gasping breaths before the man who had been following him came up on the run . This guard nearly fell over his fellow before he perceived the dark figure on the ground . With an oath he leaned down to investigate , while Carpenter lay close against the slope of the stockpile . He was still crouched low when a rifle barrel prodded him in the small of the back and a hoarse growl advised him to  | drop his gun . The firearm clattered to the ground . Now , beat it , you louse , ' growle &Carpenter,; and he provided the man with sufficient initial speed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course pointed out to him and was almost immediately swallowed up by the night . Carrying the rifle at the ready , Carpenter swung in a wide circle and headed back toward the south . Fifteen minutes ' walk would take him to the Salmon , where he would hide the sample and investigate the wound in his side . He could feel the blood running down inside his clothing , but he felt no shock and so conjectured that it was only a flesh wound . As he climbed between the strands of barbed wire that marked the northern limits of the Salmon , he could see lanterns bobbing about in the dark behind him . A sudden exultation came over him . McKinlock would have something to worry over now . None of the guards had recognized him , and he doubted if they would discover that a sample of ore had been picked from the last car . Skirting the rim of the big pit , he reached the main road and swung down toward the lights that marked the mine buildings . If he had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have noticed that the red glow on the southern horizon had perceptibly intensified . Two figures were visible as he crossed the small yard to the office , but they stood at the far end of the open ground and he failed to notice them . Neither did he notice the white roadster , parked close against the side of the building . He stumbled up the front steps and was astonished at the effort that it cost  | i m . Walking into Old Dan 's office , he dropped into chair , wondering idly where the old man might be tt for the door was open and the lights all on . Looking down , he discovered that a pool of blood had col-ted , in the few seconds since his arrival , upon the hite wood of the floor . He was about to investigate When steps sounded on the hollow porch and Dan Armitage appeared in the doorway . Behind him came Blanche Brundage and there was a great fear in the girl 's startled blue eyes .  | CHAPTER X WHEN Blanche Brundage drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bryan Carpenter , her emotions were in a whirl and she had little to say to either her father or to McKinlock . After reaching the Redmonds ' , she went at once to her room and spent the entire day , except for the space of a short nap , in attempting to straighten things out in her mind . She felt singularly at sea up here on this barbaric Iron Range . She was somehow out of step with things ; even Mrs. Redmond jarred on her . Things were peculiar and strange . During the middle of the day , for instance , the town was so quiet as to seem almost deserted . The solution of this mystery , of course , was simple enough : except during off hours the inhabitants were all at work . But the regime of the eight-hour day was nothing in Blanche 's life , and its visible effect of draining the streets of people appealed to her as being almost uncanny . It made her feel as though some dreadful pestilence might be about . Wherever she had been before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and night . Another angle to this frontier atmosphere that bothered her was the universal familiarity and independence of the inhabitants . On the previous afternoon she had accompanied her hostess while she made a few purchases . The shopkeepers and their clerks had all greeted Mrs. Redmond by name and  | it It no particular deference . There was none of the scquiousness to which she was accustomed when gaged in a shopping tour in the East . At first she d watched her friend in some astonishment , but rs . Redmond did not appear in any way offended nd proceeded about her shopping in perfect good humor . Blanche felt herself out of her depth . She reviewed the events of the morning . What a impleton she had been , to faint away like that ! What would Bryan Carpenter think of her , accustomed as he was to the steel nerve and stolid indifference to danger or pain so characteristic of the Range ! Clasping her hands about her knees , she leaned back on the soft cushions and let her fancy wander unchecked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had known for only two days ? He fascinated her . Ile was so entirely unlike any man she had ever known before . On the train , that morning , he had been perfect . The next time she saw him , he was brutally beating a man in the dust of the street . The same night , he had led her through a dance than which she could remember none more delightful . He was personally attractive . He was strong , brave , and talented ; and yet there was something when she was with him that frightened her . It seemed almost as though she received some indefinable warning that there must never be anything between them . Try as she might , she could not overcome this feeling , nor could she imagine any plausible explanation for it . Certainly it was not because of any social gulf that existed between them . She was not even sure that any such gulf existed . It was something deeper and ,  | more elemental . Yet she had thrilled to his kiss of the morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the house . She recognized it as McKinlock 's . In the fading light of the late afternoon she distinguished her father sitting in the rear seat beside the mine operator . She wondered why her father was seeing so much of this man , whom she both disliked and distrusted . She had encountered him first several years before , when he had visited their Philadelphia home , following an acquaintance that developed in New York . It was no part of her present plans , however , that she should see more of him than was necessary . The sound of dinner chimes rose to her from the lower floor , and she slipped to her feet and across to her dressing-table . McKinlock stayed for dinner , and afterwards suggested that she accompany him to the mine to view the hoisting by night . She was seeking desperately for some excuse whereby to escape when her father settled the matter by accepting for both of them . She felt that this self-invitation on the part of her father hardly appealed to the mine operator , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to the waiting car . Before leaving , Blanche slipped a fetching evening wrap about her shoulders , and as she leaned back in the deep cushions her blonde beauty was lovely to behold . Evidently McKinlock was by no means insensible to this , for he dropped one arm carelessly over the back of the seat and leaned down so that he might look into her face .  | Did you ever hear of the Blanche Mine before you arrived on the Range ? ' he asked . She admitted that she had not . Well , it 's not surprising , for no one else ever did until I came myself . That property used to be the Leopold and the day we ? I bought it , I changed its name . ' He leaned closer and his thick smoker 's breath almost suffocated her . It would be easy to hate this man , she thought . Can you guess why I picked out the name that I did ? ' he persisted , and he let his arm drop closer about her shoulders . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is that red glow way o$ to the south ? ' The operator sat up with a grunt like some huge beast ? he was still sore from the manhandling that he had received at the fists of Bryan Carpenter . What glow ? Oh , that ! Why , that 's just ? well , I 'll be damned ! ' He peered back over his shoulder for several seconds , and then with another grunt turned back to his guests . " c'hat 's a reflection of the forest fire that you 've heard all the talk about . Not much of a glow for a forest fire though . It wo n't interfere with our trip to Duluth to-morrow ; we 'll go through so fast that our breeze will be likely to put it out . ' Blanche tightened her lips in indignation . So they were going to Duluth on the morrow ; and every one knew it but her . They had reached the corner , where  | they turned south toward the Blanche , when a man rushed from the corner saloon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver stopped , and the messenger jumped to the running board . There 's some I.W.W. doings at the mine , sir , and Koranski has been killed . One of the other guards heard the shot and got there just in time to get run off himself . He got some help and went back , and they just ' phoned that Koranski was the bird that got it . He was lying at the west end of the stockpile . ' McKinlock stiffened in his seat and his big hands opened and closed spasmodically . His face grew purple and his eyes narrowed to savage slits . Damn those pups to hell ! ' he roared ; why those yellow , worthless bastards ? I beg your pardon , Miss Brundage . ' With a mighty effort he controlled himself and turned to the girl 's father . We 'd better let her out here , ' he growled ; it might get unpleasant at the mine before we leave there . She 'll be safe enough if she 'll wait over there at the drug store for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mind , ' began the elder man , but the operator cut him short with a curse . You come with me ? you can stand some of the gaff as well as the gravy . ' Blanche descended from the car with a tight feeling at her throat . No one had ever dared to talk to her father like that before . And he had n't said a word in reply . What kind of hold did this great brute have  | on her parent ? Suddenly she felt a great sympathy for her father . He was not a man 's man . Even she n  --  alized this . Wall and Broad Streets comprised his native habitat . Thrown in contact with anything elemental , he was out of place and helpless . She grieved for him now , for she knew what a panic there twist be hidden beneath his tight-lipped face . She watched the car until it passed from sight , and for several moments thereafter stood in deep thought . What could it be that her father had become mixed up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had McKinlock meant by the gravy ' ? She was not squeamish and had cribbed her line or two of French with no qualms of conscience , but irregularities in business were another thing . It would be unbearable for her to know that her father was implicated in anything that was not quite straight . But that could not be ! Surely she was borrowing trouble . Where was her nerve ? Where was the courage that had stood her through her first air experiences ? She began to appreciate that it was one thing to ride in a stunt plane under the admiring gaze of hundreds of people and be able to appear perfectly calm , especially when she had little knowledge of the dangers involved , and another thing to maintain her courage almost entirely alone in a strange environment . Perhaps she was not so self-sufficient as she had always prided herself on being . A screeching of brakes aroused her , and she looked up to recognize the white roadster that belonged to Bryan Carpenter . Old Dan Armitage was driving , and he hailed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost , young lady , or are you out on a private expedition in search of local color ? ' Neither , ' she replied , welcoming the interruption to her unhappy thoughts . I 'm bound for home . Will you give me a lift ? ' Sure I will . Climb in , and we 'll hustle right up there . ' She caught up the folds of her skirt and jumped in beside him . I suppose you have noticed the light from the forest fire , ' she said , pointing off to the southwest ; you ca n't see it from here very well , though , these buildings interfere too much . ' No , I have n't , ' he replied , catching at an opening whereby to accomplish a design that had been behind his decision to stop and speak to the girl . Say , how would you like to drive down on the point beyond the Salmon , where there 's nothing in the way ? ' Oh , I 'd love to , ' she said . The old miner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dirt road . As they drew nearer and nearer to the Salmon , the red flush on the horizon became increasingly brighter . Objects began to stand out against the vivid sky . Except that its arc was relatively narrow and capped with a pitch-black border that shaded gradually to a Prussian blue at the zenith , the display might well have been mistaken for a somewhat unusual and lurid sunset . To the girl , there was something sinister in the vermilion patch that held her gaze . All about them , now that they had left the lights of the town behind , the land was shrouded in impenetrable darkness . The wind ,  | which was blowing harder and harder from the southwest , sifted through the underbrush and whipped through the higher tree-tops . Armitage drove into the mine office yard and cut out the powerful headlights . He was a straightforward man in every respect , but lately he had begun to piece things together in his shrewd way . He suspected that there was some connection between McKinlock and this girl 's father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect that the Easterner was merely visiting him and had accidentally been introduced to the owner of the Blanche Mine . In view of the renaming of the property , this was hardly plausible . It was his naive purpose to try and pump ' the girl for enough information to allow him to continue his deductions with more confidence . Getting the binoculars that Carpenter had used that morning to survey the neighboring mine , he escorted Blanche to the southern extremity of the level ground , where it terminated in a point that overhung the titanic excavation below . Take a squint through this , ' he commanded ; you 'll be surprised how close the glass will bring that fire . ' With some assistance from the old miner , the girl focussed the glass on the patch of inflamed sky . Oh ! ' she cried at her first glance , clutching the old man 's arm in her excitement ; it 's terrible ! Why , I can see flames that must be a mile high . ' In truth , the spectacle that greeted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The  | glasses disclosed a vast area of fiery red , streaked through now and again with serpentine flames that thrust up like inverted lightning bolts into overhanging billows of black smoke . Huge brands , swept up in the maelstrom of combustion , whirled like pathless meteorites against the vivid background until eclipsed by some slithering tongue of flame that licked up from the cauldron below . Silent and sinister and appalling it was ; and the girl experienced a tremor of real fear as she gazed through the binoculars . She could hardly bring herself to admit that such a thing of terror and destruction was a physical possibility . Dropping the glasses , she closed her eyes . Upon opening them again , she found that the detail of the fire had shrunk to its former indistinctness and the only evidence of its being was the blood-red glow that topped the distant hills as before . I have read of the terrible Minnesota forest fires , ' she breathed , but I never imagined that anything could be so awful as that . ' Armitage chuckled as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoking-car sages ca n't be here to take a look , ' he mused . I 've heard ' em tell how , if they was ever caught , they 'd rush right through it and get on the other side . Either that or lie down flat and let the fire blow over ' em . It takes a traveling salesman to think out the answers to most of our national and local problems . ' For several moments he observed the spectacle in silence , swinging the glass from side to side so as to sweep the horizon .  | ' That fire is about twenty miles away , ' he estimated , but there 's little fires this side of it , which explains the fact that you can see flames and suchlike . The big smoke is moving northeast and , if this wind keeps up , the road to Duluth will present some hot traveling by to-morrow . ' It suddenly came to Blanche that she and her father were to make the journey to the lake port on the following day . Will it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But nobody will be crazy enough to try and make the run after the reports that have come in . ' You are wrong there , I am sorry to say , ' she replied seriously . My father and Mr. McKinlock are going to try it to-morrow morning and I have to go with them . ' The old miner opened his lips in what probably would have been a rather scathing denunciation of the project , judging from his snort of disgust , when the sound of heavy steps on the office porch caused them both to swing about . They saw a dark figure stumble up the steps . As the man passed through the lighted doorway , they recognized the big form of Bryan Carpenter . They perceived that he staggered slightly and swayed from side to side . With a sharp ejaculation , Armitage slipped the binoculars into his pocket and ran for the office . The girl followed and was at his heels as they entered the small room . The sight that greeted their eyes made at least one of them deathly sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair and from his left foot a wide  | pool of blood spread in a gruesome circle on the floor . ' Where did they get you , lad ? ' cried the old man , dropping on his knees and beginning to tear at the lacings of the high boots . Under the arm , I guess , Gramp . It ca n't be very bad , for it does n't pain me any to speak of . I 've lost enough blood to make me a bit woozy is all . ' Huh ! Them plugs that do n't hurt any is sometimes the worst kind . Let me take your coat and vest off . ' Between them , the old man and the girl removed Carpenter 's jacket and shirt , disclosing a huge red splotch that flooded his left side from the under side of the arm down . As Armitage wiped the blood away in order to examine the wound itself , the youth glanced up at the girl . She was staring at him in fascinated concern and was almost as white as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloth at her feet . Here was realism . This phase of romantic shootings seldom was portrayed on the screen . She was wondering if he were going to die . Like most women , she thought of shootings as being invariably fatal . No matter from what angle a gun went off in the movies , the bullet usually snuffed out some life or other . Certainly there was enough blood spilled here to justify a mortal wound . Armitage heaved a sigh of relief as he examined the hole beneath the big shoulder . The steel-jacketed bullet had passed cleanly through the muscle that ran from the point of the shoulder to the back . The only real danger would be from the powder burns  | which had been the natural consequence of the short range at which the hit had been made . " 1'liat 'll heal up in a hurry if it 's treated right , ' he observed , but it 's got to be handled better than I can do it . I 'll give Doc Southern a ring . ' Carpenter roused himself from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't call Southern , ' he whispered ; we do n't want this thing to become known . Give Jimmy 1 ) eVoe a ring . He 's as good as any doctor for this sort of thing , and he 's a friend of ours who 'll know enough to say nothing without being asked . ' In a few seconds Armitage had the connection , and from the conversation Carpenter and the girl knew that Jean 's father was leaving immediately . Armitage put on his hat after making the call and strode to the door . You hold that cold rag tight against the hole till I get back , ' he ordered the girl , and his voice was sharp and curt . I 'm going down to the dry and get the first-aid box . That young ass of a Hankins lugged it down there yesterday . ' Mechanically , Blanche dipped the indicated rag into the bucket of cold water that served ordinarily as the office drinking-supply and held it against the dark slit from which the blood was still welling . It all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only supposed to happen in novels . As the ministering angel she should be brushing the fever away with her cool hands , but she doubted the practical application of this theory . She looked down at him . His eyes were open , but he appeared to be staring into  | space . He looked tired rather than sick . As a matter of fact , Carpenter was suffering from the after effects of shock and the temporary exhaustion of his late exertions rather than from the bullet wound . He leaned back in the office chair completely relaxed , and only dimly conscious of the girl 's presence or the fact that she had slipped one arm about his shoulders so as to rest his head . They were in this position when Jimmy DeVoe and Jean found them . At sight of the other girl , Jean 's eyes went wide in hurt surprise , then she caught sight of Carpenter 's dejected pose and her lips trembled . Her father bent over the couple and put aside the blonde girl 's arm , so that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iodine , he held an inhalant under the youth 's nose . The reaction was almost instantaneous . Carpenter opened his eyes and found sufficient strength to push the potent tube violently away . The dazed look cleared away from his blinking stare and he recognized the faces bending over him . Hello , Jean , ' he mumbled ; sorry I 'm going to be so late to the party , but I had something that had to be done first . ' Noticing Jimmy DeVoe for the first time , he sat up straighter and took a pull from the flask that was offered him . Its warmth revived him and he felt his strength returning fast . I 'm all right . I feel dog-tired , but that 's all . ' By the time Armitage returned , he was able to stand up . The hole under his arm was burning like a hot brand now , for Jean 's father had run a cottonwound stick , saturated with disinfectant , entirely  | through it . Jean had washed the wound on the exterior and had bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also amazed the other girl . This I o rthern maid possessed a cool efficiency that shamed her . Nor did she miss the tenderness of the Range girl 's touch as she deftly applied the dressing prepared by her father . Through it all , Jean had little to say . She confined herself entirely to directions , telling Carpenter to move his arm this way and that to facilitate her work . When she had finished , she picked up her father 's loose instruments and , after packing them away , donned her big coat . Thereupon she wished the two of them a pleasant good-night and walked out to her father , who was talking with Dan Armitage . Carpenter promptly threw a handy ' mackinaw about his shoulders and staggered after her . He drew her to one end of the porch . That ? it was mighty fine of you to leave your friends and come down here to-night , and I ? appreciate it . ' She looked out across the dark countryside toward the red glow that still wavered on the western horizon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , was it ? ' she asked . Do n't be silly . I 'd have done the same thing for ? for Mr. Fogardy . ' Her words were brave , and he knew that she was forcing herself to smile up at him , but he caught a half-sorrowful note of reproach in her voice that was meant to be suppressed . Be careful , ' she advised him , as she climbed into the DeVoe car beside her father ; the next time they  | may come just a little bit closer , and there was n't much to spare this time . ' Her soft hand rested against the side of the open car and he caught it in his and raised it to his lips . Good-night Jean , ' he murmured . He watched the tail light of the car till it passed from view . Then he turned toward the office , a tumult of conflicting emotions in his breast . As he had released Jean 's hand , she had turned it palm inward and drawn it caressingly across his cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that touched him to the depths . All at once he felt tired again , as though she had taken with her the spirit he had known a moment before . Withla slow tread he walked into the office . Blanche was putting on her discarded wrap and Old Dan was making no move to assist her . They locked up the office , got into the white roadster , and , with Armitage driving , rolled slowly up into the town . At the Redmonds ' place , Carpenter accompanied the girl to the door . Good-night . I 'm sorry that you 've had such an upsetting evening . In spite of what you must think , I have n't been robbing a chicken roost nor have I murdered any one ? yet . ' She bit her lip and did her best to be casual . It was difficult under the circumstances . She was angry with herself , angry with Jean for proving the better nurse in the emergency , and angry with Carpenter for leaving her at the mercy of her imagination while he bade Jean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; you 'd bet-  | r get some rest . Tell Mr. Armitage that I enjoyed a. forest fire very much . ' With a swish of soft garments and a short laugh , be waved him a good-bye and closed the door . He as left gazing stupidly at its monotonous exterior . As they drove up the long hill to the boardingnIlse , Armitage voiced his feelings above the whine f the motor laboring in second gear . She 's one of ' em . They 're all in cahoots , and they amn near got you to-night . Mark my words ? chinlock and that slinkin ' little father of the girl 's re up to something crooked , and , in addition to that , eKinlock has got it in for you . I 'd have found out mething to-night maybe , only you happened to rop in in the midst of our conversation . That girl 's smart one ; she acts as open and aboveboard as a evivalist , and just like one of them hypocrites , she 's ' kely to be up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You noticed how well she showed up beside Miss Jean , did n't you ? There 's a girl ! ' As Carpenter eased himself into bed , he grinned at his own expense . He had started out to attend a party . Instead of attending one , however , he had been chased about like a rabbit , shot at and hit . In addition , he had incurred the displeasure of two very lovely young women . What a hell of a night this turned out to be , ' he complained to the dresser , as he snapped out the light , but I got the sample we needed , which helps some . '  | CHAPTER XI WH1 Carpenter awoke the following morning , he rolled over with a groan and stretched himself luxuriously , being careful , however , not to move his left shoulder and reopen the bullet wound beneath the gauze and adhesive tape . He was stiff and sore , undoubtedly because of his exertions in jumping along the tops of the ore cars , and he appreciated the undeniable pleasure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this stiffness . When he turned in the evening before , he had had a slight fever , but this had entirely disappeared . Except for the muscular soreness and that tender spot under his arm , he felt as fit as ever . He lay for some time looking up at the ceiling before the clicking of his wall clock caught his attention . It was nearly eight o'clock . Ordinarily he arose at seven . A puzzled expression crept into his eyes , and he rolled to the edge of the bed so as to be able to look out the window . He was not surprised that he had overslept his usual hour , but he was astonished at the murkiness of the morning . The Iron Range is too high to be much troubled with fogs . Outside , the day seemed to be breaking with a dull ocher tinge that made of the sky a palette of mixed yellows and grays . The sun was nowhere to be seen , and such light as there was seemed to emanate from the ground rather than from overhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmo-  | sphere . The tremendous fire area southwest of the town was making itself felt . For some time he debated the advisability of getting up , and finally swung his feet to the floor and proceeded to dress . Descending to the first floor , he found Mrs. Gloster and several of her help standing in the sun porch looking out at the weird landscape . The girls were obviously nervous , but the landlady took the matter as something to be expected and nothing to worry about . As a matter of fact , the town was not in danger , for the gigantic open pits served as effectual guards on all sides save the north , and that approach was not threatened . Carpenter betook himself to the sun porch and dropped on the cushioned swing for a smoke . Evidently the McKinlock crowd had chosen to keep the shooting affair quiet , for otherwise it would long ago have reached the ears of Mrs. Gloster . He was thinking that the fire must be of really alarming proportions when his white roadster shot over the brow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brake bands . He sat up with a start . Old Dan never drove recklessly unless there was grave need of it . He could tell that something serious had happened from the old miner 's actions . He was at the door and met him as he came running up the walk . Armitage 's first words reacted upon him like an electric shock . Jean 's down on the Miller Trunk highway . She went out at six o'clock this morning in their car to bring in a family that had nothing to get away in . The rangers have been calling in ever since midnight ? telling people with cars about farmers that ca n't  | get out of the fire area . She just called Jimmy from a ranger station . The car is broke down at the Cuyuna crossroads . All the The sentence remained unfinished , for Carpenter had disappeared within . In an incredibly short time he came running around the corner of the house with a big double-bitted axe in his good hand . Tossing this into the car , he jumped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alley , where he turned in and backed out again almost without stopping . Armitage swung aboard as he headed back toward town . Jimmy DeVoe is damn near crazy . He called me from Leba , and I told him we 'd be ready when he got here and for him to meet us at the garage next to the post-office . He 'll stop the first car coming this way from Leba and ought to get here before we can fill up with gas and oil . ' ' We " nothing , you ca n't make this trip , Gramp . Her Dad 's got first call , and we 'll need the rumble seat to bring back any extras there may be . Why was n't word sent out last night that the fire was getting as bad as all this ? ' It was , but you and I were n't where it could reach us . The fire got worse along about four o'clock this morning ; previous to that they counted on the wind switching and driving it west . ' They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasp with alarm . As they neared Dad Bloodsoe 's drug store , Carpenter put his weight on the brakes and they rounded the corner with a slithering of rubber . A block ahead was the garage  | and before it were several cars . As they came to a stole , Armitage jumped out and shouted to the farmer whose small truck was usurping the space in front of the solitary gas pump . ' Pull up , pardner , ' he yelled ; we 're in a terrible hurry . ' ' Das too bad , ' the unkempt settler drawled with maddening deliberation ; aye tank you got to vait till aye bane done first . ' Carpenter missed the exact words , but he caught the sense of the statement . He was no stranger to the stupid obstinacy of the uneducated Scandinavian . Shifting into low gear he moved ahead and , with no more effort than would be required of a locomotive moving a pushcart , he nosed the obstructing vehicle far enough beyond the pump to enable the gas hose to reach his rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dashed inside for a can of lubricating oil . A screeching of brakes caught his ear as he cleared the threshold and a rapid glance showed the disheveled figure of Jean 's father jumping from a steaming auto . Armitage was pouring water into the radiator and the garage man was screwing at the cap on the gasoline tank . Emerging from the gloomy interior of the one-time livery stable a moment later , with two tins of lubricant under his arm and a long crowbar that he had caught up as something which might prove of service , he was just in time to see the irate farmer and the garage man begin a tug of war with the gasoline hose . Evidently the farmer was sincere in his objections to being displaced . Carpenter set the oil tins on the run-  | ning board , dropped the crowbar in the road , and made a swift dash for several yards . His strong hands caught the surprised farmer fairly on the chest in the manner that back-field men employ on the football field . His arms were rigid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight . The settler went over backward like a diving artist and rolled in the dust to the edge of the ditch . Meanwhile , Jimmy DeVoe had stored the iron bar and one of the cans of oil in the car . Armitage was immersed to his waist under the hood , pouring the second quart into the crank case . When the gas tank overflowed at last , the attendant lifted the metal nozzle with a quick sweep and Carpenter screwed frantically at the cap . As he was leaning over , he suddenly received a tremendous shock that threw him against the spare tires mounted on the rear of the car . The farmer had taken advantage of their preoccupation to sneak in a beautiful kick of revenge . Armitage started for the man with fire in his eyes , but Carpenter waved hint back . There 's no time to monkey with him , Gramp ; he had it coming to him , anyway ; he does n't understand what this is all about . ' In spite of himself and his terrible concern about Jean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so appealingly human . He jumped to the leather seat and was about to pull away when a cry from the old miner stopped him . A big touring car was rolling up the street , and at the wheel sat a hatless man whose face was red and streaked with black . In the front seat with him were two women with three children on their laps , and in the rear were three more  | women and half a dozen frightened children . Their ! es were dirt-streaked like the driver 's and seamed ith care and fright . One flat tire and a yard of listered paint attested to the narrowness with which hey had escaped the flames . The car drew alongside and stopped . The driver wiped his coat-sleeve across his red-rimmed eyes and leaned over the side . For God 's sake , hurry ! ' he croaked . There 's more down there that ca n't get away . We came up from Napersville , and the fire must be way past there by now . ' ' Did you see any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt Jimmy DeVoe 's fingers clutching his arm like steel claws . ' Saw a blue car in the ditch as we came past , but it was too smoky to see anything else . Keep to the right and turn on your lights . ' Ile screamed the last , for the long , low-built roadster was roaring up the highway that led into the fire area . For two miles this road was paved , and Carpenter bore down on the gas until the right of way seemed to be literally flying to meet them . Other cars and wagons and telegraph poles ? all flashed past and behind them as though they rode on the wings of the wind . He leaned down and jerked open the cutout without removing his eyes from the black center line of the paving , and the illimitable power of the big-bored motor roared its deep-throated challenge to the outside world . Visibility was still fair , for they were racing parallel with the fire . Fortunately there were few vehicles to be dodged . Such wagons as there were on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach and drew far out to the edge of the ditch . Once they swung past a truck and back again to the right side just in time to miss another car coming from the fire area . At the rate they were traveling , they required great distance in which to shift sides of the road without the gravest danger of turning over . Suddenly Jean 's father cried out above the battering of the wind . Hold up , Bryan , we 're doing seventy and the turn 's only a short way the other side of this crest . ' But the younger man had already begun to ease up on the accelerator . As they bore down on the turnout , their tremendous speed threatened to carry them past . Heavy as it was , the big white car swerved and rocked , and there was some doubt in Carpenter 's mind , as he started the turn , whether he would be able to complete it . Luckily , the curve had been banked at this point and they rounded its upper rim and swung into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt and pebbles high into the air . Ahead of them lay miles and miles of straight road , its low crown and hard surface making up in part for the low visibility with which they would shortly have to contend . Somewhere under that great black smudge , that rose like a huge storm-cloud above the horizon , was Jean DeVoe . As they almost jumped over a low ridge , the appalling extent of the terrible scourge became more apparent , and each of the two men felt a cold clutch at his heart that he could combat only by sheer will power . Reason was already turning traitor .  | A vision of Jean 's laughing brown eyes rose before Carpenter , and he thought of her many tendernesses toward him . Her girlish inconsistencies , which had occasionally annoyed him , suddenly appeared but the flowers of a beautiful playfulness , which should have endeared her to him the more . He saw only the sweetness of her and the indefinable gayety which characterized her outlook on life . Somewhere ahead , in the withering heat that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lungs , her soft , graceful body might be lying in the choking smoke , forever lost to him . He cursed aloud , and tears of determination sprang to his eyes . I 'm coming , Jean ? I 'm coming , Jean ! ' he cried over and over , and as though in spirit with him , the powerful car leaped ahead through the hazy curls of smoke which were rapidly growing more oppressive . Both men were hatless and without coats , but they no more felt the cold air than two stone images . Soon this air grew warmer and the smell of burning wood filled their nostrils . Suddenly a car shot toward them out of the distance , traveling at breakneck speed . It flashed past like a meteor , and once again they strained their eyes in a fruitless effort to pierce the rolling obscurity that hung over the peat lands through which their course led them . With terrifying suddenness another car sprang from the murky wall ahead , and then another and still another . Fragments of wild shouts reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all but their effort to keep the road and race onward . The older man sat tense and silent , the wind whipping  | his white hair into a tumbling froth and snicking away the tears that started down his seamed cheeks . Jean , Jean , ' he was whispering in his despair ; dear little girl , do n't leave me ; we 're coming for you . ' He clenched his fists till the cords of his lean hands stood out like rawhide , and his breath came in labored gasps as though a great weight lay upon his breast . He looked at the youth beside him , and suddenly he prayed that his girl would be spared to fulfill a long-felt wish that she and Bryan would one day find it in their hearts to love one another . It would be a fitting thing that this splendid youth , racing with death to save her , should care for her ever afterward . He looked at the strong lines of Carpenter 's face and the clean sweep of his jaw and the determined coolness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fire . Into his heart there crept a faint feeling that they would be in time . This man would never admit defeat ; somehow his courage and strength would lead them to Jean and get them all safely back again . By some chance of fate his mind reverted to the driver who had escaped and who had hailed them at the garage in Taconite . He remembered all at once the man 's parting caution to light their headlamps . Leaning forward , he threw the cowl switch and the big lights flashed their powerful beams into the gray translucency ahead . This simple act saved their lives , for a moment later the brilliant shafts flashed on a huge truck , stalled squarely on the crown of the road . By some miracle , Carpenter brought the car to a stop before they crashed . They jumped out , one  | oil each side . The truck was abandoned . Whoever had been driving it must have been picked up by one of the cars that had passed them on the road . Obviously it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd by with the huge vehicle in its present position . Jimmy DeVoe leaped to the driver 's step and yanked at the steering wheel . Carpenter gripped a spoke of the nearest front wheel and heaved till the muscles rose along his back in great bands . The truck stirred and rolled slowly backward . Jean 's father jumped for the crowbar and added his strength and the bar 's leverage to the younger man 's efforts . In another moment it was clear and rolling slowly and ponderously down the slight grade to the ditch . They were back in their seats and lurching ahead in second speed even before it left the road and toppled over on its side . Peculiar air currents swooped down upon them now from time to time , and the sky was gradually darkening to an inky blackness . The smoke was growing heavier , too , so that they were forced to slacken their speed lest they wreck the car and thereby destroy their one hope of reaching Jean . Forty miles an hour was a dangerous speed , and soon this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even at this moderate speed , they risked a smash-up at any moment , for , if a car coming toward them chanced to be on the wrong side of the road , there would not be sufficient warning to enable them to swing out of its path . Twice they made false stops , when it seemed to them that they heard the wild blowing of a horn . Each  | time they speeded up again , and Carpenter shot the car ahead at reckless speed till the utter impossibility of foreseeing turns or obstructions forced him to return to a less dangerous pace . From landmarks that he had recognized , Carpenter judged the crossroads to be some five or six miles ahead of them . They were entering a wooded section , and the proximity of the main fire became at once apparent . The lowering cloud above their heads grew denser and more forbidding , and occasional swirls of smoke enveloped them in a choking obscurity . At such times , Carpenter kept on the road only by watching for the right-hand ditch . Once , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside headlight by main force so that it threw its beam directly to the side of the roadway . His eyes were red and inflamed and his throat burned , for the windshield was little or no protection as long as the top was down and there was no time to stop and put it up . As a matter of fact , the last thing in the world that either of these men was thinking of was personal comfort . Burning twigs and pieces of bark began to fly through the air , and here and there dry bushes flamed up in short bursts of fire . The dry grasses , also , that grew high along the edge of the gravel , became ignited and flared brightly as they crept past . An orange glow loomed up ahead of them . It proved to be a lone tree that was burning fiercely ; crackling like a machine gun as the resinous wood surrendered to the sinuous red flames . Just beyond it , a burning tamarack lay across their path . This time Jean 's  | fa 11:er leaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat , breathless and half-scorched . A terrific gust of wind , stronger by far than any that had previously descended upon them , brought the car nearly to a stop . The top leaf of the windshield swung loose and shattered into a thousand pieces which tinkled about their feet . The fabric cover , which held the collapsible top in place , rattled at their backs like the slatting of a sail in a sudden squall . And on the wings of this blast there came a veritable deluge of burning fragments . Seen against the night-like sky , this meteoric shower was appalling . The two men bent their heads and dodged about to miss the larger brands . In the unnatural light , Jimmy DeVoe 's white hair shone out like a beacon , and as Carpenter shot him a rapid glance , he saw that the older man 's face was filled with despair . Setting his teeth , he kept his eyes on the impenetrable curtain of smoke and falling embers that limited his vision to but twice the length of the car . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot fog for days . His hands were burned and seared from the falling fragments , and several times Jean 's father beat out small flames that leaped up from his clothing . His reason told him that the quest was hopeless , but his indomitable determination led him on . They might both be burned alive , but they would continue to advance until they found Jean or were wiped out by the main body of the fire . The smoke lifted  | The land took a dip at their very feet and fell away into a shallow valley , a quarter of a mile across . Through this valley ran the Miller Trunk Highway in a straight line , like a gigantic part in the closestanding second-growth timber . Across the middle of this valley another road ran at right angles to the main highway , visible because of the elevation at the northern rim . The intersection of the two was marked by a forest ranger 's station and a diminutive schoolhouse . In front of the former , several people could be seen standing in the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these figures had been the cause of DeVoe 's first cry , for the forms of two women could be made out even at that great distance . But it was not the valley nor the small group of figures that held their gaze , in spite of the wild hope that surged in their hearts at the probability of finding and saving Jean ; instead , it was a spectacle so terrible and titanic in its proportions that their very reason seemed to totter as they cringed before it . Over the southern rim of the wooded basin had burst the great , main body of the fire . For as far as the eye could travel to the right and left of them , there rose and roared a salient of flame impossible to describe . Blood-red , it stretched its leaping , deadly tongues to the sulphur-hued panoply of menacing black smoke . Like some gargantuan barrage , the flames licked upward from the field guns of the forest , The entire valley crackled in the vermilion light , while to the ear there was borne a moaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | tift.s of driftwood . For a moment the two men in the tiny white car sat aghast ? stupefied before the mesmeric power of the supreme spectacle . Then Carpenter drew his breath sharply , and came to life . This was the last chance ? a matter of minutes separated them all from eternity . With a staccato song that could hardly be heard above the omnipotent roar of the forest fire , the throbbing car shot down the clearly defined road into the very trough of the land-sea whose opposite rise was a leaning sweep of flame . Faster and faster they raced , for the accelerator was flat on the footboard and the man at the wheel was gambling with seconds . The screaming wind at their ears was hot and blistering , and the tears that it brought to their stinging eyes were dried to vapor almost before they were whipped away . Down the convexed , gravel surface they hurtled , the gleam of their headlights futile and incongruous . Ten seconds , twenty , thirty , forty ? they were nearly there . Carpenter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the group which ran toward them up the side of the ditch . He was searching for a spot to turn . There must be no miscalculation . If the car should become mired ? embogged in some chance sore of treacherous muskeg ? it would be fatal . God , how hot it was ! Carpenter 's face felt as though it was cast within a plaster mould . The pain in his eyes was almost unbearable . IIe could see steam blowing from the radiator cap . A sudden rattling and banging brought his heart to his mouth ? a broken bearing ? No ? the noise stopped ;  | probably a shot of gravel against the under side of the pan . Off to the right , just on the near side of the crossroads , he saw an open space that looked firm enough to carry the car . He straightened out with his feet against the brake and clutch pedals and one strong arm heaving in on the emergency . He swung wide and began the tern , feeling the right side of the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot up under the smouldering trees . The engine was racing with an open throttle , for he intended to run no hazard of stalling . Even before they came to a stop , he slipped the gears into reverse . He whirled in his seat as he eased up on the clutch , so as to see the road behind him . The rear wheel under his shoulder spun backward and the white car recoiled from the clearing as though bounced back from a block of rubber . They were in the road once more and facing toward home . Strange men appeared at Carpenter 's elbow . He left the motor running and fell into their midst . He looked wildly from side to side , hardly realizing that he was shoving the men about like tenpins . Jean ! ' he shouted , catching a man by the throat ; where is she ? Answer me , you fool ? where is she ? ' Some one plucked at his arm , and he turned to see Jimmy DeVoe 's agonized eyes . The older man waved toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . One had slumped to the floor of the car ? the other was Jean . Though her face was drawn and anguished and her eyes filled with terror , she smiled at him and beckoned . His reason rushed back ,  | and he was suddenly calm . He had found her . Now they would run for it , and nothing would prevent him from carrying her through to safety . She was in his trust , and the whole damned world could n't snatch her away from him . A big form rushed past him and tore at the door of the car . Under the grime on his features , Carpenter recognized McKinlock . The man was insane with fear . Blanche Brundage 's father and McKinlock 's chauffeur were crawling into the rumble seat . He heard DeVoe shouting at the giant trying to crowd in beside him and saw the old man shoving the other away . He might as well have attempted to stay an avalanche . Carpenter caught the operator by the shoulder and swung him about . Too late he sensed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a cornered tiger and lashed out with his fist . He caught Carpenter high on the cheek and spun him around . Retreating from the blow , the younger man tripped and fell flat . Still in the dust where he had fallen and momentarily too dazed to keep his feet , he saw his assailant climb into the driver 's seat . He struggled to his knees and felt some one tugging at his collar . It was the chauffeur . He was leaning down from the rumble seat and was struggling manfully to draw Carpenter onto the mud guard . Beside him , the financier was screaming and chattering like a madman . Carpenter wondered why McKinlock had n't driven away in his frenzy and left him to certain death . Regaining his feet , he saw in one glance the reason why . Jean was standing upright in the car and over  | her head she held the double-bitted axe . Its wicked steel cutting edges gleamed in the unnatural light , and beneath them the girl 's steady eyes gleamed with a rivaling brilliancy . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tender-hearted girl as she bade the mine operator wait for Carpenter . And fearful as McKinlock was of the rushing scourge behind them , yet still greater was his fear of the determined girl who threatened to cleave his skull with the terrible weapon of her native woods . Even as Carpenter 's head cleared and he was about to jump to Jean 's side , there came a bumping crash from behind them , followed by piercing screams of mortal anguish . He swung about just in time to see a big sedan stand on its nose and somersault into the opposite ditch with a rending of wood body and the shattering of glass . Carpenter guessed what had happened while he was running the short distance to the wrecked car . Full of terrified farmer folk , it had raced parallel with the fire in a desperate attempt to reach the Miller Trunk and escape to the north . Seeing the fire almost upon them , the driver had taken the turn at impossible speed . Forced to cut the corner too close , the front wheels had struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car lay on its side , crumpled and twisted . Carpenter noticed that it appeared to be wet , and realized with a start of terror that the liquid must be gasoline from the burst tank . A head appeared and the hopeless face of a middle-aged woman was illumined in the growing brightness . She was whimpering hysterically , and began at once to beat helplessly  | against the jammed door . Leaning over the side , he saw that she was caught so as to prevent the others from getting out . Heartrending screams issued from the dark interior , mingled with the frightened cries of small children . A man 's voice caught his ear , and he moved over so as to peer into the front seat . From within came a desperate query . Is any one there ? Is any one there ? ' Yes ; how can I help you get out ? ' shouted Carpenter ; can you give me your hand ? ' You ca n't get me out ? my arm 's under the car , get the boy out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he reached down to pull out a youngster of three or four years . As the little body cleared the door , a burning brand dropped into the opening and Carpenter staggered back . For an instant the black window looked up at the glaring sky , then a shaft of flame shot high through its glass-fringed frame . A terrible medley of screams burst from the death trap before him as under his very eyes it became a raging furnace . A white arm reached up through the window at the back and beat frantically at the air until gashed and torn by the ragged glass . A hideous odor of burning flesh assailed Carpenter 's nostrils , and he was forced to retreat from the terrific heat . The woman , caught in the door , writhed and gasped in agony , and , just before the flames hid the car entirely , slipped back inside . They were beyond all earthly help . Sick and nauseated , he caught up the child and whirled toward the white roadster . He was just in time to see Brundage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jimmy DeVoe 's white head lay still against the back of the seat . The car shot forward and raced away toward the north . Overhead the livid glow was giving way to flickers of wind-driven flame . The fire was almost on them . White-lipped and shaken , but fighting to the last , Carpenter ran up the road with the unconscious child hugged against his breast .  | CHAPTER XII M It . BELCH FOGARDY sat on the steps of the Armitage Mining Company 's Salmon Pit office and puffed reflectively at his gnarled and blackened pipe . Occasionally he removed this smouldering offense and spat a long and unlovely stream of molassescolored tobacco juice at some haplessly inanimate - object . He eyed the smoke-yellowed morning with mild disapproval and blinked his heavy lids with deliberation . He had been out the night before until very late , and his eyes smarted prodigiously . His feet were hot and uncomfortable , also , for he had n't troubled to remove his boots for the snatch of sleep that he managed to slip in just before morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the arrival of Bryan Carpenter , for he had important tidings to impart . The previous evening he had worked until long after the usual supper hour helping to repair a broken steam shovel . Three things had prompted him to this . One was his loyal interest in furthering the affairs of the Salmon Mine ; another lay in the pleasure he derived from working about dirty machinery ; and the last lay in his allegiance to the shovel runner , who was quite as disreputable an Irishman as himself . Surrounded as they were by honyoks , bohunks , and mountain niggers , it behooved two pure-blooded sons of Erin to stick pretty close together ? at least , to such an extent as was apparent to the outside world .  | After the repairs had been accomplished to Tim Heeny 's satisfaction , the shovelman had suggested that they visit the Chinaman 's and have a bite to eat , as their boarding-house would have long since ceased serving the evening meal . Afterwards they could wander over to the bar of the Taconite Hotel or up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frontier dance-hall was maintained . Fogardy had agreed , and they set out , both somewhat strengthened by a divided pint of hard liquor . As they tramped up the long board walk , they made a queer pair , for the shovelman was a huge figure , beside whom Fogardy appeared somewhat as a pocket edition . They met the night shifts of miners streaming toward the Salmon and the Blanche as they neared the town , and it was their pleasure to walk two abreast and force the miners off the sidewalk . Many a surly growl they provoked , but none of the swart foreigners attempted to dispute the way . Reaching the main street , they turned to the left , and halfway down the block entered a two-story building before which hung the bottle-marred sign of Wung Hun Lo , an imperturbable little Chinaman , who through some chance of fate had found his way to this rough section of the far-flung United States . Inside was a long counter covered with oilcloth , which ran down the full length of one side of the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round-topped stools on which were perched several customers . A dozen square tables filled the remaining floor space , except for a monstrous coal stove , which was by far the most ornamental object in the place .  | Its polished nickel trimmings and bright bolt heads listened in silent rebuke at the shabby egg-stained al ) lc covers . Four huge oil lamps were hung , one at net corner of the room , and dispensed an evil light hat barely sufficed to illumine the customers ' food . ' ogardy and Tim Heeny seated themselves before a ' loth that resembled a geography done in spilled yrup and coffee , and called loudly for service . A rther pretty though coarse-looking girl entered rom the kitchen and set two thick tumblers of water - cfore them , leering into their faces with bored interest . Hello , Tim , ' she rasped . Where 's One Hung Low at ? ' demanded Heeny , reaching out a great paw and dragging the girl toward him . Aw , he 's out huntin ' the mice for to-night 's supper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's sittin ' out on tha stoop , all hunched up . ' Sick , hell ! You and Swede make him take so much av his rent out in trade , he 's weak ? that 's what 's the matter with him . ' He tweaked her companionably on the hips , and she laughed loosely . Say , if you want a treat , Tim , beat it up to my room and walk right in without knockin ' . ' She leaned down and whispered in his ear , and a broad grin creased his weathered face . Take Belch along with ya , ' she suggested , if he is n't too old to stand it . ' Together they stumbled up a narrow stair and groped along a dark hall toward a door , beneath  | which there shone a gleam of light . As Heeny laid his hand on the knob , a sharp voice demanded , Who 's there ? Keep tha hell out of here , will ya ? ' The big Irishman pushed on the door , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and it flew open , vibrating like a violin string . Inside was a dingy room lighted by a kerosene lamp that stood on the floor , and beside it was a galvanized iron washtub , in which stood a tall , brown-haired woman ? entirely nude . Araw ! ' shouted Heeny , in a voice that echoed through the building like a thunderclap ; we 've came to call on yez , Swede , old girl . ' The woman stepped out of her makeshift bath streaming like a seal and reached toward the bureau . There was no blushing or maidenly shame on the part of this Amazon , whose six feet of white glistening body was wonderfully well proportioned and , strange to say , quite free from the usual blemishes common to her profession . A hairbrush swished through the air and was rapidly followed by a shoe , a soap dish , and an empty perfume bottle . A second later , a tiny revolver appeared in her hand , and it spat flame toward the ceiling . ' Get outa my room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lips held a faint smile and the gun was elevated to provide more than a margin of safety . The hairbrush missed its goal , but the shoe caught Fogardy on the side of the head . In the poor light it was almost impossible to dodge a missile thrown from so short a distance . The china soap dish took Heeny neatly on the jaw and shattered into a dozen frag-  | nts that rattled down his broad chest . The perDir bottle grazed their faces and exploded against wall . Utterly routed , they retreated through the it and scrambled toward the stair . The sharp bark the revolver filled them with panic , and , falling cr each other in their haste to get away , they ttered down the treacherous winders and fell into e public room below . They were greeted with a ar of laughter from a group of miners , who had been ailing for this very thing to come to pass . After stigating her little joke , Sarah had tipped off the . atrons . Seated once more at their table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fogardy 's ear was nicked and . e had bumped his elbow during their descent down he precipitous stairway . Heeny 's chin was cut and dripping blood on his shirt-front , while fragments of china still lingered about his person . Ai n't she a bitch , though ? ' he exulted to his companion ; the boys do n't put nothing over on that little girl . And hansim ? say , did yez notice the beautiful lines on her ? just like them dirtily pictures in the art gallery down to St. Paul . ' How old are yez , Tim ? ' asked Fogardy . Thirty-eight come Thanksgiving . ' Well , it 's different with a lad of your tinder years . Wait till ye 've passed fifty loik I have , and yell know betther than to walk in on ladies takin ' their bawths . ' Further discussion was interrupted by the arrival of Swede 's sister with a tray full of dishes . She was immensely amused at the outcome of her little joke and  | proceeded to kid Heeny unmercifully as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his lap and adjusted a strip of adhesive tape over the cut on his chin . You have n't been up to see me in quite a while , ' she pouted , after the wound was bound up to her satisfaction ; do n't run around with them cat-house girls , Tim ? there ai n't a decent Jane in the whole bunch up there . ' ' Ay course you 're a lily-white virgin , ' mocked Heeny . You know what I mean , ' she snapped ; and do n't get so damn fresh or I 'll likely pop your skull open . ' With this Sarah walked off in high dudgeon and left the men to their drinking . An hour later , however , she reappeared , bringing with her a Scandinavian girl in a red hat and jacket who was very evidently ill at ease . Listen , Tim , ' she began ; this kid 's a cousin of mine , and she works for Redmond 's wife . This new gazink , McKinlock , was up there the other night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gossip that 's worth a hun'erd dollars any night in the week ? concernin ' that new mine they bought from your outfit . ' Well , tell her to spit it out , ' growled Heeny . You heard me , big boy , ' spat the sullen girl ; it 's worth a Give her a buck , Belch ; you 're more intherested in tha damned mine than I am . ' A buck ! Why , you big cheap skate ; say , what this kid here knows is worth Get tha hell outa here , ' roared the shovelman ,  | t uddenly becoming irritable ; we do n't give a tin loop for your silly little stinkin ' story . ' Ile swung around with a groan , so as to present hiback to the girls , and propped his feet on a weird ? prcimen of Chinese furniture that must have been sonic family relic of Wung 's . Thereafter , each time the waitress attempted to speak , he bellowed a shut up ' with such vehemence that the pans rattled in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and launched a new attack by slipping her arms around his neck . God , but you 're a big boy , Tim . They say you 're the biggest guy down at the Salmon . Why dontcha come around ofener , Tim ? Gee , we 're always glad to see ya . Come on , say somethin ' , Tim ? Tim ? Tim . ' ' What ! ' roared the harassed Irishman , and the very plates on the table jumped . The girl in the red jacket shrank back and looked in indecision at Fogardy . He beckoned to her . Here 's two dollars , ' he whispered , placing the bills on the table and covering them with his rough hand ; tell me somethin ' f'what intherestin ' and it 's your jack . ' The girl glanced toward her late champion and exploiter , but Sarah was sitting on IIeeny 's lap , playfully biting at his big nose . The girl glanced back at Fogardy and then down at the money and dropped onto the stool at his side . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although Fogardy 's expression conveyed nothing , his eyes grew brighter and the beer fog seemed to roll off his numbed and aching  | brain . He experienced some difficulty in understanding her , for she had not been long in the country , but the gist of her story was to the following effect : She had been about to leave the Redmonds ' on the previous night , after washing and drying the dinner dishes , when she heard strange voices in the diningroom . Looking in from the pantry , she saw the big mining man whom she knew by sight as McKinlock . He was talking to the father of the blonde girl from the East . Prompted by curiosity , she remained hidden in the dark and listened to their conversation , which they carried on in subdued voices , as though fearful of being overheard by their host and hostess in the outer room . Is n't there an awful risk of its being discovered sometime ? ' the Eastern man had quavered , picking nervously at his nails . No ; that 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there . They wo n't drill any more than they have ; they 'll never come through the dike , even if they develop the Lone Jack , which they probably wo n't for years and years , and they wo n't run a drift from the Salmon because Hankins tells me they tried it and dropped work when they failed to find anything in the first hundred feet . The pocket is at least three hundred feet from the farthest point of the exploration drift , so there 's no use in our worrying about that . ' But I ca n't understand why it wo n't show on the surface . ' Because , ' went on McKinlock , with an expression of patient disgust , there 's a big pond over it . You 've  | oven the pond . It covers the whole area under which the pocket lies . It 's fed by that creek that runs through the property , and I 've had the outlet of that pond dammed up little by little for the past month , until now it is practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one will notice that the pond is getting In rger either , and even if they do , it wo n't make any difference . They 'll figure some kids did it . In a short time it will be frozen over , and then our little secret is sealed for the winter . Before spring we 'll have all that bessemer ore out , and then I 'll turn the pumps from the Blanche into the hole . We 'll bulkhead the connecting drift and let her fill up . Until the stockpiles are out next summer , we 'll pump into the pond to make up the seepage loss , and after that we 'll pull out and let the Blanche fill up herself . Hell , man , it 's safer than your bed . ' Further talk had been interrupted by the arrival of Redmond , and the girl had slipped away . Realizing that something out of order was in progress , she had confided in her unprincipled cousin , who was too ignorant of mining matters to grasp the true significance of the story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy money . She had picked out Heeny as a likely subject on whom to test out the possible value of the information , as she knew that he was antagonistic to McKinlock , having been rudely repulsed when he condescendingly offered his services as shovel runner for the spring clean-up of the Blanche stockpiles . But the big Irishman 's indifference somewhat belittled the potential worth of her cousin 's story in her eyes , and consequently she  | did not seek to interfere with the progress of the story being told , especially when she noticed that Fogardy 's face remained blank as he listened . It would not have been surprising if his expression had been indicative of some confusion , for the recital was not a little disjointed . How did yez remember all that ? ' asked Fogardy , when the girl had finished . For a moment he entertained a suspicion that he was being sold . My old man 's a mine captain , ' she replied . Say , I know as much about mines as you do . ' Her simple face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanished . " T is damned little to pay two nice green dollars for , ' he complained , pushing the bills toward her , but I may find some use for it . Mind that yez kape your trap shut now , though , for ye 've sold the shtory to me , an ' I 'm gain ' to play a little joke on me friend McKinlock . If you shpill tha beans , I 'll remimber them two bucks that I 've gived ya and come an ' get ' em back again . ' He rose to his feet and swayed dizzily for a moment . Come on , Tim ; f'why sit around this rat 's nist all night ; let 's be goin ' home . ' Five minutes later , he was groping through the dark location alone . Heeny had decided to spend the night uptown . It was well toward dawn before he was able to find any sleep , and two hours later he was up again and tramping through the smoky morning toward the mine . At the moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the mine office , he was n t tempting to review in his own mind the story which had come to his ears the night before . In an effort to reconstruct it , piece by piece , he became confused on several points . His memory seemed to have vapored away , leaving an intangible cloud of impressions to torment his brain with a myriad inconsistencies . Suddenly he sat up straight and shook his head savagely . Just what did he remember of what he had heard ? Had he actually heard anything ; or was all this a dream from which he had just awakened ? Panic-stricken , he lurched to his feet . A worker was passing on his way to the pit , and Fogardy hailed him . It was a member of his track crew . He caught the surprised bohunk by the shoulder and shook him out of his natural stupor . Listen , lad , ' he cried ; tell the boys that I 'm up on the rim of the pit lining up them thracks we laid yesterday , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I said he was reshponsible fer tha gang of yez , and , by Jasus , there 'll be hell poppin unliss them cross-ties is all moved by whin I get back there . ' With a bewildered expression , but a set jaw , he crossed the office yard and struck off toward the town . His head was aching prodigiously , and his thoughts were more muddled than ever , but one thing he remembered : a greasy-faced girl in a red hat had told him something of great importance not many hours before , and she was somewhere to be found in the vicinity of Wung Hun Lo 's establishment . Looking decidedly like the morning after , ' he  |  | reached the main street and stumbled into the shabby restaurant . His inflamed eyes were at once rewarded with the spectacle of Tim Heeny , bolting a breakfast of wheat cakes . At sight of him , the big shovel runner waved a greeting with his fork , on which were impaled many syrupy fragments , and motioned to an adjoining stool . In spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had eaten nothing since the day previous . He crawled onto the swivel seat and drained a handy tumbler of water . By the time he had wiped off his mouth with the back of his hand , Heeny had managed somehow to masticate and submerge in his interior the baseball of cakes that he was choking down when his friend entered . How rotten yez look this marnin ' , ' he gulped ; f'why tha hell did yez run off like that lasht noight ? ' Where 's that pie-faced dame as was talkin ' with me ? ' growled Fogardy , disregarding Heeny 's question . Sure , an ' how should I know at this toime of day . She 's shpreadin ' butther on John Ridmand 's toast with her unclane little claws likely , or maybe she 's still shleepin ' somewheres upstairs in this lousy , damned barn of Wung 's . ' Fogardy slid off his stool and started for the stair with the evident intention of testing the latter possibility , but Heeny called him back and began fumbling through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper and waved it like a banner over his head . Belch , me boy , ' he gloated , look f'what I gipped offen that yenchin ' little huzzy in tha rid sky-piece.  | " l'is a map drawed by thot pig-headed McKinlock , sliowin ' tha Salmon Pit an ' his new mine an ' ither items . I 've not had toime to look too close at it yet , but its damned intherestin ' , to judge from what I did see . She found it on the Ridmands ' floor , and she niver told nobody she had it till it dropped out av her pocketbook an ' I copped it . ' Ike was about to spread it out before the eager eyes of Fogardy , when the door burst open and a man wearing a chauffeur 's cap rushed up to the counter . Without a second of hesitation , he jerked away a bell glass and began filling his pockets with the leathery doughnuts stacked beneath . Before the surprised Chinaman at the cash register could gather his wits together in the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar and started for the door again . He was almost to the threshold when another figure crowded the opening and spoke to him in a curt , quick voice . ' You should n't go alone , Frank ; if anything gets in the way or the machine breaks down , you 'll need help . Maybe one of these two boys will go along , they look like just the right kind . ' He stepped inside , and the two pit men recognized him as the superintendent of a large mining company which operated a dozen or more properties on the Mesabi . Will one of you boys go along with Frank , here , and help to get an isolated family out of the fire area ? I 'm taking my car and going after another family . Speak quick ? there 's not a moment to lose if we 're going to make it ! '  | Fogardy stepped forward , buttoning up his mackinaw , and Heeny slid to the floor and reached for his hat . Their instant acceptance was so mutual and unmistakable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't both go ? the extra space will be needed . You 're the smallest ' ? he addressed Fogardy - you 'll do ? come along . ' They ran outside , and the superintendent jumped into a new roadster . Without a lost effort , he put the car into motion and sped away up the street . Fogardy and the chauffeur leaped into a large touring car that bore the insignia of the mining company operated by the man ahead and roared after him . There 's a family of eight people that we 're goin ' after , ' explained the chauffeur ; they ' phoned in early this morning and said their horses had run away and they had no way to get out except to walk . The only road we can get there by is the Miller Trunk ; we 'll go south on that to the Cuyuna crossroads , and then turn east . The boss thinks there is n't much time to make it in , and he must believe what he thinks all right to judge from the tracks he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This buggy does sixty-five , but he 's a mile ahead of us already . He 's goin ' farther south than we are . I wanted to take that call , but he says nothin ' doin ' . Told me it was easy to replace a superintendent , but that good chauffeurs was hard to get . That 's his way of sayin ' that he takes the rough end of anythin ' . I 'd go anywhere for F. J. Say , have a doughnut ? help yourself outa my pocket . That 's another thing the old man thought of . He made me  | stop and get ' em . Said it was more fun dyin ' on a full stomach than on an empty one . Maybe he was n't kiddin ' ; look at the smoke up ahead , will ya ! ' When they came within sight of the crossroads , the car ahead of them was just disappearing over the far rim of the valley . They could see the gleam of its headlights reflected on the trees for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background of storm-cloud sky . Slowing down , they took the turn to the east and started up the dirt road , which was badly cut by the ruts of farm wagons . For five miles they bounced along between the walls of dry timber that grew on either side . They were beginning to fear that they had missed their goal in the smoky fog that hung over the ground when a clearing opened up before them and a house was visible , set well back from the highway . A small boy ran to meet them , waving a piece of white cloth . As they rolled up the drive , the farmer himself appeared at the door and beckoned them inside . Fogardy jumped out and ran up the slight rise to the house , while the chauffeur turned the car about in readiness to make a quick getaway . Within the house , all was confusion . The farmer 's wife and his aged mother were frantically throwing articles of clothing into a huge box . The two daughters were lowering the furniture , piece by piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The farmer appeared bewildered and carried on a continuous and incoherent argument with his wife . Often he ran to the south windows and looked out , only to resume his talking and complaining . Several times he went to the front door as though to assure himself that a car was actually there to carry them all to safety . While the chauffeur lent his assistance to the women , Fogardy stepped out on the rear stoop and pumped himself a drink from the cold cistern . Several hundred feet behind the house a root cellar had been dug in the side of a small rise , and into this , two lanky youths were attempting to drive a motley and stubborn group of farm animals . A rangy cow , a hog , two goats , and some chickens made up the list . Even as Fogardy lifted the tin dipper for a second drink of the grateful spring water , the half-wild cow broke away and disappeared over the rise , closely followed by a beautiful collie dog . One of the boys started in pursuit , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried him , and he considered that it was high time they were on their way . Not only was the sky darker and the drifting smoke more prevalent , but a peculiar stillness seemed to pervade the air , like the hush which often precedes a whirlwind . He noticed small particles in the air and one small brand dropped blazing into the yard . Shouting to the boys to come in at once , he ran to the front of the cabin with a bucket of water for the radiator . Ile was astounded to find the rear seat of the big touring car filled with household effects . hither of Jasus ! ' he muttered ; do they think we 're movin " em some place for a visit . Hey , there , inside ? get out here quick if yez do n't want to be fried alive . ' Dropping the pail , he leaped toward the tar-paper door , just as the two daughters emerged under a  |  | burden of winter clothing . They were both over twelve years of age , and quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things started , Fogardy gathered one under each arm , and a moment later dropped them into the tonneau of the car . Shtay right there where I 've put yez , ' he barked a , t them , an ' do n't yez dare to get out , or yell niver ride again in an authomobile . ' A minute later he had the farmer 's mother beside them , while the chauffeur , alarmed by the Irishman 's presentiment of danger , followed suit by literally dragging the buxom housewife from her prized belongings and crowding her in with the rest . The two boys had taken places on the running board , and it was only by main force that Fogardy got them in with the women . The farmer he had already assigned to the front seat with the chauffeur . As they started for the gate , one of the boys leaped overboard and scampered back toward the house . With a roar of anger , Fogardy dropped to the road and went after him . The youth tore for the rear of the cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he reached the end of the drive , he paused , as though to listen , and Fogardy caught him by the slack of his overalls . He twisted and squirmed like a young eel , but the track boss kept his grip and dragged him back to the car . They were almost ready to start out when the other youth jumped out and attempted to dash past . With a quick lunge , Fogardy reached out and slapped him flat on the ground . Before he could rise the chauffeur came to the rescue , and between them  | they got the boys safely stowed away . Meanwhile , one of the girls was making efforts to get out of the car and was only restrained by her mother 's grip on her dress . The men were growing desperate when a yellow streak flashed toward them from around the far side of the cabin and the collie dog leaped into the car . Immediately the younger folks subsided . Let 's go ! ' cried Fogardy ; we 'll . be lucky if we get as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all this horse an ' dog play . ' As the little man at the wheel stepped on the gas and they started for the main road , another car rushed past at breakneck speed and disappeared in the thickening smoke . It came upon them so rapidly that there would have been no chance of avoiding a crash had they been twenty feet ahead . With one of the boys sitting in front and sounding the horn continuously , they rushed west to meet the fire . Burning brands began dropping about them and the temperature of the air mounted perceptibly . The farmer sat holding the youth who was blowing the horn . Ile seemed dazed by the impending catastrophe . To him , the loss of his house and barn and the pitifully meager head of live stock was more real than the threatened loss of his own life or the lives of his fancily . Speeding from the east as they were , they ran almost parallel with the fire , and because of the thick growth of timber were unable to view the terrible spectacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this fact , for no man could have looked into that flaming horizon without succumbing  | to a wild panic and hurtling himself and his fellow passengers down the treacherous road at a rate that would have meant destruction . Even as it was , the white-faced chauffeur fed gas into the six cylinders until the big car rocked dangerously . It was all that Fogardy could do to maintain his place on the running board . Suddenly he uttered a hoarse shout of warning . The crossroads had taken form out of the whirling smoke . And overhead a great sheet of red flame swept to heaven in an anguished rush to head them off . Mither of God ! ' cried the Irishman ; do n't thry the turn , boy ? do n't thry the turn . ' But the little chauffeur knew his trade , and he was standing on the brake , straining at the emergency with one hand while he fought with the other to guide them safely into the main highway . Fogardy felt the inside wheels lift under him as they skimmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide toward a flaming mass at the roadside . Now that they were on the straightaway and unprotected by the trees from the full force of the herculean blast at their heels , the heat smote them with an intensity that was unbearable . It was not within the scope of human endurance to withstand such conditions for many moments . Trees were breaking into flame on every hand and the road was sprinkled with flaming torches . There remained for them one last chance ? and that depended entirely upon the reliability of the throbbing motor . A curl of smoke leaped up from the back seat . Risking a fall and inevitable doom should he slip ,  | Fogardy worked his way back and reached into the tonneau where a pile of bedding was ablaze . With one heave he cast the whole supply over the side , noticing as he did so that the two women had fainted . Better so , perhaps , whichever way Fate might decide the issue . The dog was cowering on the floor of the car , snapping with gleaming teeth at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A quick rush of withering heat and choking fumes rushed upon them and they lurched toward the ditch ? only to swing away and regain the center of the road as the tortured driver cleared his crying eyes . They began to pick up speed , and the Irishman was about to hurl himself within the car when a violent swerve nearly threw him under the wheels . Looking up , he beheld a dim figure staggering forward through the inferno of smoke and dropping sparks . The car slowed down , and a wild cry drifted back from the front seat . The little driver was a man . Not one in ten thousand would have risked his life under similar circumstances to save that of an unknown straggler . It would have been no craven act to have sped past , balancing the chances of saving many against the possibility of rescuing one more . But the driver had been born and bred on the Range ? no further accounting for his action was required . As they swept alongside , the muscular track boss reached out his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding out a child at arm 's length . Fogardy caught the small bundle with a deft sweep and dropped it over the side into the laps of the unconscious women . As they drew past , he caught a  | husky good luck ' from the faltering stranger . Dripping with sweat and afraid to look behind or overhead , he summoned his remaining strength for one last effort . Dropping to the road , he ran back and caught the tottering unknown by the arm . Dragging him forward by main force , he caught up with the crawling car and pushed him against its side , at the same time taking a crotch hold and heaving upward . The big figure toppled inside , and a moment later Fogardy threw himself after it . As he sprawled on his face , he felt the car jump ahead , and for a brief second heard the heavenly roar of the deep-throated exhaust . His head was swimming and there was a roar in his ears when he next remembered anything . He dreamt that he was burning at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . A great cloud of smoke descended upon him , and he imagined that he was slipping into what must be the beginning of death . The sensation was not altogether uncomfortable save that one persistent flame was winding its soft , caressing pain about his right leg . He would have welcomed this experience with death had it not been for this one impudent little flame . Eventually it so annoyed him as to bring him back to a world of misery and muscular nervelessness . He rolled over on his back , unmindful of the snapping dog , and stared up at the smoky sky ? at last free from the terrible red glare that he knew he would remember till the grave should overtake him and forever shut out the memory and horror of it . As he looked upward , he saw that his trouser leg was burning along  | the top of his boot , where his right leg still lay over the top of the door . This was the pain that had troubled his descent into restful oblivion . He watched it stupidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once up , he beat out the smouldering fire with his hands and tore the burnt cloth entirely away . Then he drew his leg inside . His eyes felt like livid coals and his chest was a furnace that blazed at every inhalation . Something smote him on the head , and in his weakness he fell back , cursing feebly . He looked at the man whom he had pulled to safety from the very fingers of death and noted something familiar about the blackened face . The eyes opened and a smile flickered over the scorched lips . Hello , Belch ; it 's a great day for driving , is n't it ? ' Holy Mither of God ! ' whispered Fogardy , and slipped back into his interrupted sleep .  | CHAPTER XIII IT was late afternoon , and , from where Carpenter and Armitage stood , it was possible to see the sun line as it crept up the far wall of the excavation . The day shift was over , and a peaceful quiet pervaded the pit , all the more noticeable because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blasting . Rough surfaces assumed an appearance of unwonted softness in the mellow light , and even the gaunt headframes and cable sheaves blended into the general background of red and gray tranquillity . Far below the two men on the platform , a fireman emerged from the boiler housing of a sizzling shovel and proceeded to wash his hands and face in a bucket of hot water , drawn from the simmering machinery . His gasps and sputterings floated up to them through the still air . After his person carne his shirt , which he rubbed and sloshed with an energy sufficient for all the washing of the village . When the garment was halfway between being clean and torn to pieces , he wrung it till the fabric cracked , and hung it over the throttle line to dry . Digging into a box mounted on the turntable , he produced a second shirt of faded blue , which he worked over his big shoulders . After adding a chastened-looking necktie , he donned a vest and jacket and caught up the inevitable mackinaw . With a hearty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track , and then , whistling merrily , jumped to the ground and swung away eastward toward the far end of the pit .  | The men , leaning forward with their elbows on the wood railing , observed all this as they puffed methodically at their pipes . They watched the fireman until his jaunty figure had passed from view around a projection and thereafter continued to gaze silently into the huge amphitheater of raw iron . They were under the spell that settles upon men who work , after the day is done and the evidence of their labors lies before them . Just as the bridge-builder treads softly over the floor beams of his half-finished span after the quitting whistle has blown , and gazes lovingly aloft , at the tracery of steel members outlined against the sky , so were these two caressing in their minds each contour of the vast excavation , with its lode lying bared and scarred ? a helpless prey to the irresistible industry whose medium was steam and steel . While you was restin ' up yesterday , after gettin ' back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyzed , an ' I 'm free to admit that it 's got me guessing , ' Armitage said . What does it show ? ' It shows high-grade bessemer ore , son . ' Carpenter whistled softly between his teeth and turned his head slowly toward the old miner . Are you sure that they did n't run a poor test ? ' he asked . I am now . I was n't at first ? any more than you 'd have been ? getting a report like that out of a clear sky . There 's something rotten in Denmark , somewhere . There never was any ore like that in any of these three properties ; leastwise , that I ever knew about . '  | The younger man pulled off his wide-brimmed hat and ran his fingers through his hair . I thought an analysis would show that McKinlock is shaving the north line of the Salmon . It 's a cinch that he is n't shaving the properties to the east or north of the old Leopold , for they have been worked out . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pierce both dikes in order to reach what there is in the Lone Jack . He must have discovered some pocket in the old Leopold that we missed . ' No , he did n't . He did n't find any ore like that inside the limits of the Leopold . They want none of it in there . Either you got a freak sample or he 's gone outside the property somewhere . ' But there is the evidence , and the sample was all right . And he ca n't have gone outside of his own limits . Where could he have gone , except into this Salmon property , which we know does n't hold any ore that runs what the sample shows ? ' Du n no , ' muttered the old man . I admit it looks kinda funny , but you mark my words ? that ore sample came originally from some place outside of the old Leopold . I may not be certain that I 'll be alive to-morrow , but , by God , I am certain of where that sample did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leopold , the mine that I spent ten years in , and that I know better than I know my own name . ' He knocked the ashes from his pipe and flicked them into the abyss . I 'll tell you something else , while I 'm at it , something that I 've had on my mind for a long time , but that I have n't mentioned because there is no way of  | proving what I suspect . I 've known this guy McKinlock before . I ca n't say where or when it was that I knew him , but I know that he 's crossed my path some place back the line . We 've had dealings in the past , him an ' me , and if I could only remember what they were , I 'll bet a couple of new cables that there would be something that stunk about what I recollected . ' While Armitage had been talking , Carpenter had noticed a faint vibration in the platform on which they stood , the same movement as was usually occasioned when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This vibration had inexplicably stopped a moment before , and for several seconds he had been waiting for some one to emerge from the open trap behind them . From where they were standing , it was impossible to see a man climbing toward them unless they leaned far out , so as to obtain an advantage of angle offsetting the overhang of the platform . Carpenter leaned out as far as was possible and looked down . The dwindling procession of rungs was empty . Whoever had caused the vibration must be immediately beneath the trap . With a quick leap , Carpenter sprang to the opening and shot down an arm toward a huddled figure just within reach . His strong fingers closed on the man 's collar and he gave a tremendous heave with his powerful back and legs . Up through the hatch came a cringing form , like a scared rabbit being pulled from its hole by the ears . Even before he had taken time to ascertain who it was , the youth delivered a mighty cuff with his left hand that spun the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this ? ' roared Carpenter , thoroughly angered . What the hell are you doing here ? ' Easy ? easy , ' cautioned Armitage ; let him go a bit , Bryan ; he ca n't talk with his neck squeezed like that . ' The engineer 's eyes were large with surprise and fear , but he mustered sufficient energy to jerk himself loose from the relaxed grasp on his collar . Let me go ! ' he said , trying to rearrange his clothes . What 's the matter with you , anyway ? Ca n't a man stop to rest a minute ? ' He was still attempting to assemble his scattered wits , and managed a semblance of outraged dignity , when Old Dan burst out laughing , and to Carpenter 's disgust put his hand on the engineer 's shoulder . Cheer up , son , ' he advised , when he could catch his breath , we thought you was some I.W.W. snoopin ' on us . Excuse my laughing , but the joke 's on you ? especially as you had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , of course , that Bryan an ' me was standin ' here talking over confidential matters . ' Hankins looked from one to the other suspiciously , as though he doubted the sincerity of the old miner 's acceptance of his excuse . A sickly grin finally spread over his face , and he went so far as to join in the older man 's laughter . Carpenter turned away in disgust and started up the wooden stairs . The man 's fawning cowardice was more than he could stomach . I 'm going home , ' he informed Armitage over his  | shoulder ; if you are going to stay down , I 'll leave the car here . ' Wait for me , ' cried the old miner . I 'll be along in a jiff . I want to talk to Hankins for a few minutes . ' Later , as they drove uptown together , he explained his action in staying to talk with the engineer . Hankins is going to make a survey of the old Leopold to-morrow . It was all arranged for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because we want to find out all that we can , and he 's going to take samples from certain points that I 've described to him . He might have stopped to rest at that , just as he said . Anyway , I figures that there was no use in holding him to account , because , if he was listening intentionally , he 'd lie out of it . It was n't any effort to laugh ? he sure looked like a sheep that had just been overjumped by a wolf . By the way , where are you going to-night ? ' Over to Leba to see Jean DeVoe . ' Humph ! I figured as much . Well , I 'd like to go along if it 's all right with you . I 've got something that I want to talk over with Jimmy . I called him up to-day and he 's out of bed . Jean is n't , though . That was a pretty tough experience for a young girl . You got out of it pretty lucky , considering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They tell me he 's got a lump on his head and about twenty burns on his arms and face . ' He 's all right . I saw him this morning . It was the excitement did him up , plus an all-night bat of some kind the evening before . He was still pretty sleepy and dopey when I saw him , but he claimed he had  | something important to tell us about McKinlock , and I had a hell of a time getting him to forget it until to-morrow . It 's a good thing for Mc - Kinlock that Belch does n't know what a rotten trick he pulled . I asked dean and her father to keep it quiet , for a while , anyway . Otherwise the gang might get together and pick him to pieces to see what makes him tick . I 'll even up for that stunt myself , one of these fine days . I guess he was almost out of his mind at the time . If I did n't think so , I 'd go looking for him right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this time and were about to start the run up the hill when a hail from the sidewalk caught their attention and they turned to see McKinlock waving at them . The operator approached them majestically and laid a hand on the side of the white roadster . Ile even became so familiar as to put his foot on one of the polished mud guards with an insolence that was not lost on Carpenter . The young man 's eyes narrowed and never strayed from the big man 's face as the latter proceeded to deliver himself of a few explanations . You 've got a fine little car here , boy . It ran like a charm the morning of the fire . That 's what I want to talk about . No doubt it looked queer to you ? the way I drove off and left you , but at the time it seemed like the only thing to do . I was waiting for you with that excitable young lady from Leba holding an axe over my head , when a cloud of smoke blotted you out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Brundage cried out to save the women at all costs . I was the only one who could drive well ,  | and ? well . I simply drove the girls to safety , that 's all . It seemed like the sensible course to take . I wan t to say right now , though , that you were mighty white in rescuing that farm child , and I want to congratulate you . ' Carpenter leaned across Armitage toward the florid face of the superintendant . Listen to me a minute , you pup , ' he said in a cold , even voice , clipping his words short as though to match the anger in his steady eyes . Can that stuff about saving the women . You left me in the road t o burn , and you damn well know it . You 're a coward and a crook . Now , take your foot off this car . ' His last words came with a rush and his hands clutched convulsively at the rim of the steering wheel . Armitage laid a cautioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would spring from the car . McKinlock 's face grew purple with rage , but he managed to retain his self-control and even forced a crooked laugh . You bet I left you in the road , and I wish to hell you had burned to a cinder . Come on my property again , like you did the other night , and I 'll have you shot down in your tracks . That goes for both of you ? keep away from the Blanche or take the consequences . ' With a savage glance he turned away and sauntered down the street . He walked slowly , as though unperturbed by the deadly understanding that now existed between them . But the manner in which he crushed the cigar between his fingers gave evidence of the turmoil beneath his calm exterior . Carpenter , on  | is part , threw the car into gear and started up the ill . His face was white and his hands trembled with Igo . Ile hardly saw the road , and it was well that . o expert driving was demanded at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lder man said . In front of his eyes floated the hateul red face of McKinlock and in his heart there ? timed a terrible resolve to kill this man when the ime came for a final showdown . Somehow , he felt hat that time was not far distant . Two hours later , he descended the stairs that led to , rs . Gloster 's beleathered parlor . There the in-vitable after-supper group of teachers was gathered , . : ossiping and waiting to see what would turn up . At these gatherings all dates were minutely gone over and suitable comments made . There had never been a year in the veteran landlady 's experience that this practice had not been sedulously observed . Always , too , there was one hardy spirit , usually of the manhating genus , who would follow up the conversational leads supplied by the others . This self-appointed wit would sit on the piano stool or on the arm of some one 's chair and send every one into gales of causeless laughter with her sarcastic remarks . A pretended . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced sallies . The newer girls and the more timid teachers would hang on every word , and gasp in real or pretended consternation at the ridicule of some absent companion or local celebrity . For an hour or so this would continue , usually to wind up with an interpretation of the superintendent of schools eating  | his soup or giving confidential instructions to some new teacher . After this finale , the listeners would drift away to voice their disapproval of the smart one 's habit of making fun of people and to gloat in secret over the nastier cracks . Carpenter listened awhile , and then wandered out to his ear . There Mrs. Gloster joined him . Which way are you going , Bryan ? ' she asked . ' If you 're going down the hill , I 'll just hop in , if I may , and go with you . Will there be room ? ' ' There certainly will , ' he replied . ' I think you need a ride . Come on . ' Shortly thereafter , they picked up Armitage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road toward Leba . In the brilliant twilight which graces this North country during the early fall , the road stood out clear and unobstructed , and Carpenter put on a burst of speed . He knew that his landlady loved to drive fast , and this trip he was nothing loath to hurry , himself . It seemed only a few seconds before they swung around the last banked turn and slowed down at the DeVoes ' street . He was about to explain to Mrs. Gloster that she would have to excuse them for a short while when Armitage took matters into his own hands . ' You run along , Bryan , ' he said . Mrs. Gloster an ' me 'll take a run over to Biwabik . We 'll drive by for you on our way back . There 's no hurry about my seein ' Jimmy DeVoe . ' Carpenter stepped into the road and smiled up at his landlady , who was watching him with an observant if motherly expression on her face . He looked  | very clean and very much of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mock concern . Watch your step , Bryan , ' she cautioned him ; no girl is going to turn you down on any proposal you may take it into your fool head to make to-night . ' He reached inside and grasped her hand . If I were sure of that , do you think that I would let you drive to Biwabik with Gramp , instead of with me ? ' he asked in a honeyed voice . Get along with you , ' she sputtered , tugging ineffectually at her imprisoned hand . I always did think you were just a little crazy , and now I know it . ' She strove to appear highly contemptuous , but a warm glow suffused her face , and the gaze that she bent on the young man was not hard . Carpenter sprang across the ditch at the side of the road and sped his two good friends on their way with a wave of his hand . Then he struck off down the sidewalk toward Jean 's home with a light step . His heart was singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere sight of such homely encumbrances as wood fences and dilapidated barns . In the smaller Range towns there are no such distinctions as select districts . There will be found in the same block the homes of day laborers and mine superintendents . In this very incongruity , as exemplified by the physical differences in the yards and houses , lies a part of the charm that is an inherent part of the Mesabi . As he drew near the big frame house that Jimmy DeVoe had built several years before to replace the original modest home , he experienced a growing  | exhilaration . He seemed to expand with every successive inhalation of the meadow-scented air , and his muscles tingled with a vigor that made him resist with some effort the temptation to break into a run . As he passed through the iron gate and heard it click behind him , he took a firm command of his exuberant spirits and forced himself to a slower pace . Calm down , you damn fool , ' he instructed himself ; any one that sees you will think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Mrs. DeVoe met him at the door and , brushing aside his proffered hand , kissed him soundly on both cheeks . The good lady was almost overcome with emotion and a suspicious moisture glistened in her still youthful eyes . We will never forget what you have done for us , Bryan , ' she cried as she led him within . Jean is all we have , and so we owe our happiness entirely to you . ' She took his hat and hung it on the set of antlers nailed to the wall . She was about to usher him into the parlor , but he hesitated at the foot of the stairs . How is Jean feeling ? ' he asked . Mrs. DeVoe smiled , hesitated for a second , then with a laugh turned and started up the stairs . Carpenter followed at what seemed to be a snail 's pace . He was to see Jean and if Mrs. DeVoe could be prevailed upon to leave them alone for a while , he would have her all to himself . He waited at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl 's room . He could hear her patting n pillow into shape and moving the furniture about .  | Jean 's voice came to him as she expostulated softly at all the preparations . He was idly kicking the varnish off the DeVoe stair landing while his thoughts soared high , when Jean 's mother appeared again and beckoned him into the front chamber . You ca n't stay too long , ' she whispered , as he stepped inside ; the doctor said she must n't be excited . ' I 'll be good , ' he smiled ; just call me when it 's time and I 'll come right away . ' You sound like a small boy , ' the lady laughed , and then , noticing that he was hearing nothing that she said , very accommodatingly returned downstairs . Carpenter waited until her matronly step diminished toward the rear of the first floor . His eyes were on Jean and the breath came quickly in his throat . He felt strange and ill at ease in this boudoir setting of lace curtains and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles on the slim dressing-table and a collection of beribboned souvenirs that filled a cabinet in one corner of the room . Jean 's voice came to him through his momentary confusion , and he found himself looking into her clear brown eyes . Here , at least , was familiar and beloved ground . Come over here and sit on the edge of the bed , ' she commanded ; do n't stand there like a big ninny . ' Somewhat reverently he crossed the room and took a position near her feet . In spite of himself he marveled at the shapeliness of the young body halfhidden under the covers . This was a new charm of Jean 's that he had not appreciated before . He tried  | to think of something appropriate to say , but hi ; mind was suddenly a void . He forced himself to glance at the floor , but it was not for long . In spite of himself , his gaze would return to the bed and caress the beautiful form resting so lightly on the oldfashioned springs . Catching her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiffened . How are you , Jean ? ' he asked , with all the soft inflections of a blacksmith calling for the next horse . Oh , I 'm fine ; how are you , Mr. Bryan Carpenter ? ' she mimicked him , with as harsh a growl as she could manufacture . He smiled appreciatively . He was suddenly aware of a great longing to lean forward and take this entrancing girl into his arms . She looked so unutterably sweet and immaculate in her flowered kimono , which was now invitingly opened a little at the breast , showing a white filmy gown beneath . A faint aroma of summer gardens reached his senses and he closed his lips to retain such self-possession as was left to him . Jean , on her part , felt that she had the situation well in hand . She loved him for his awkwardness . It does not speak well for a young man 's morals when he is too much at ease in the atmosphere of a lady 's boudoir . I thought that Mr. Armitage was coming over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard Dad say that Old Dan was coming to see him about something that happened years ago up north . ' cramp 's taking Mrs. Gloster for a bit of a ride , ' replied Carpenter , recollecting that lady 's parting  | statement ; he 'll take her to Biwabik and stop in for a few moments on his way back . ' Suddenly Jean leaned forward and peered at him with anxious brows . ' Oh , what is that mark right back of your ear there ? Bryan Carpenter , is that a burn ? Why , it 's a blister as long as a pencil . Here , let me see ? hold still . ' She sat up and moved forward that she might view the ugly burn that creased the side of his tanned neck . In so doing , the covers slipped lower and more of the mysterious gown peeped from beneath the edges of the brilliant kimono . He bent his head obediently and found his eyes very close to the swelling breasts that rose beneath the filmy lace . The suggestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , sure touch of her fingers was on his hair and one creamy forearm brushed against his cheek . His right arm moved forward as though actuated by some impulse other than his own , and he leaned closer . ' Oh , Bryan , that must hurt ! ' she was saying , but he hardly heard the words . ' Bryan ? what 's got into you ? ' His lips touched the soft flesh at the edge of her gown and he raised his head . His right arm circled the supple young waist and a tingle of exquisite joy coursed through him as he drew her close and ran his left hand into the night cloud of her dark hair . There were the finely chiseled and color-flushed lips he had longed so much to kiss of late and he marveled at the porcelain white teeth that lay be-  | neath . He felt her gentle breath on his face and was conscious of its sudden agitation . He lifted his eyes higher and the fire and strength of their blue beat down the fast-surrendering pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw doubt and questioning and belief and love fill their lovely depths , and his heart seemed almost to choke him . Her arms ? her soft , bare , beautifully rounded arms were slipping about his neck and he could hardly believe his own happiness . She was whispering faintly , and he caught a sentence or two as she swayed toward him with closed eyes . Oh , Bryan ? you 've always been my boy . Ever since I can remember I have loved you , though only lately have I understood how awfully , awfully much . ' Two great tears welled out from beneath the fluttering , black lashes , and her half-parted lips quivered in expectancy of the kiss that never reached them ? some one was calling harshly for Bryan Carpenter from the road before the house . Steps sounded on the stairs , and he arose in a daze as Jean slipped from his breast . A moment later , Mrs. DeVoe stood in the door , and there was a great sorrow in her eyes . There is some one down there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who is it ? ' he asked stupidly , struggling against a feeling of impending evil . Swede Nielsen . She says that she wo n't leave until she 's seen you . ' For a moment he felt that the sky had fallen . Then he turned to Jean with a mixture of wrath and supplication in his eyes .  | Will you excuse me for a moment  --  there 's a mistake somewhere ? I shall come right back ? I wo n't be a moment . ' You need n't , ' she said bravely , an infinite sadness in her voice ; good-night , Bryan , and thank you for coming for me through the fire ? I had meant to tell you that ? a little later . ' For a second he was on the verge of catching her by the shoulders and forcing her to see the truth , but the hopelessness of it stayed him . He knew that Swede Nielsen would keep her word and refuse to move until she had seen him and accomplished her purpose , whatever it might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braying . With a bitter heart he strode from the room ? a feeling of irredeemable loss gnawing at his breast .  | CHAPTER XIV GEORGE McKnvi.ocK sat in a yellow swivel chair and gazed silently at his feet , which were propped on the edge of a battered roll-top desk . Occasionally he spat into the jumble of plans and papers which tossed like the whitecaps of an angry sea beneath galleries of small drawers and dust-filled pigeonholes . In one corner , as yet untouched by the big man 's methodical spitting , a rangy , white cat lay asleep in a letterbasket . A ray of sunshine poured in through the east office window and fell upon the desk . The cat stirred , stretched its legs deliberately , one by one , and , without troubling to get off its back , began licking its fur coat . Even this stray pet was stained with the red hematite of the Mesabi . McKinlock broke the spell of his silent brooding with a jerk of the head and dropped his feet to the floor . He swung around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveyed the meager furnishings of the small office as though for the first time . His eyes shifted sullenly from one object to another , and finally came to rest on the dented alarm clock that hung from a spad nail driven into the wall . It was seven o'clock . Arising stiffly , he stamped his boots ors the wood floor , to restore the circulation in his legs . His eyes were red and inflamed , and his face had r-pasty look that spoke eloquently of little sleep . Walking to the water cooler , he recovered the tin cup that had dropped to the floor and held it beneath the  | small tap . No water was forthcoming . Without comment and with great deliberation , he stepped away a pace , swung his heavy boot and sent the iron stand with its inverted spring-water bottle crashing into the corner . Turning next to the desk , he sent the white cat flying with a sweep of his hand . From behind a thick roll of blue-prints he dragged forth a bottle and removed the cork by jerking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the quart container before he plucked it from his lips and replaced it in its hiding-place . He ran his fingers through his tousled black hair , wandered to the door and flung it open , and stood looking out at the brilliant morning . With a jaundiced eye he noted the crisp freshness of the air , the fleecy white clouds that rode the morning breeze and the great orb of the sun where it had just topped a distant chain of hills . Neighboring mines were whistling the hour , and the melody of their combination reached him with diminishing volume as the hills caught up the sound waves and tossed them back and forth across the countryside . It was , in all truth , a day to lighten one 's heart and supply vigor for the start of great undertakings . But its potency seemed to rebound from the dulled sensibilities of the mine superintendent without visible effect . He bestirred his big frame and walked to a near-by pump , where he summoned sufficient energy to draw a basin of cold water from the cistern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature , he laved his face and neck and dried himself on a semblance of towel that hung near at hand . He was still engaged  | in this activity when a man swung around the corner of the office . The newcomer hailed McKinlock with a raucous , unpleasant voice . Good-morning , boss . I 'm sorry I 'm late . ' McKinlock blew his nose vigorously , sans linen , and gave the man a sour look . Like hell you are , ' he grated ; you had a good night 's rest and a good breakfast , and you 're perfectly happy ? you damn Polock . ' The man grinned and followed him into the office . Inside , McKinlock seated himself on the swivel chair and motioned toward a convenient stool . Listen , Koranski ; you 've worked with me for some time and you know what to expect . Well , the game 's getting close ? a hell of a lot closer and a hell of a lot quicker than I thought it would . Everything was all right till that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's suspicious , and he 's got the old man suspicious . We 've got two things to do now ? one 's to satisfy old man Armitage that everything is all right underground and the other 's to get that young buttinski out of the way . ' I 'll take care of the first by making use of Hankins , their engineer , and I 'm looking to you to take care of the second . I 've got to keep my hands off that job . He and I have mixed it too much already . Now , what are you going to do about it ? ' An evil leer spread over Koranski 's face , and he opened and closed his hands suggestively . I 'll get dat guy , ' he muttered ; do n't worry , boss ? after he crocked me dat time when he come around at night , he de same as signed his own death warrant .  | I do n't never forget dem tings . I 'll get him , and I 'll get him good an ' quiet-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , ' growled the big man ; if you crab the deal , you 'll answer to me for it . I 'm in this thing to win , and it 's only because of me that you 're loose and able to get in on a deal at all , of any kind . Where would you be right now if you were n't here ? ' A furtive expression fled through Koranski 's eyes , and he remained silent for a moment , during which the noises of the awakening mine floated in to them through the open door . Looking up , he noticed McKinlock 's preoccupation and for the first time saw the wreckage of the drinking-water stand . What 's de matter , boss ? It takes a lot to faze you , but ya sure look punk this rnornin ' . ' McKinlock smiled grimly before answering . I 'm a damned fool , Koranski . This man Brundage , that I 've got hooked up with me , is such a weak sister that I ca n't depend on him for anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though you know why he was needed at the first . Also , I have to get a hold on him to help me get something that he 's got and I want . I 've got something on him all right , but I 've hung a millstone around my own neck doing it . He 's so damned stupid that I had to sketch up the lay-out for him the other night at Redmond 's and the first thing that he did was to go and lose it . God knows . who 's got it now . On top of that , Redmond is sore at me for giving some of these local playboys the merry ha ha . To hell with him ? to hell with everybody in this barren dump ! We 'll show ' em yet , ,  | though . We 'll make ' em sit up on their royal behinds and take notice ? and the sooner we get at it , the sooner we 'll be in doing it . ' He dropped his hands to the arms of his chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , Koranski ; let 's get going ; we should have been out of here an hour ago . ' Snatching a canvas jacket from a hook behind the door , he caught up a miner 's lamp and filled the carbide chamber from a convenient drum . Koranski followed suit , both men also filling tobacco cans with the gray lumps , which they slipped into their hip pockets for emergency use . A moment later they crossed the threshold and strode rapidly toward the timber shaft . Whatever McKinlock 's faults might be , he acted rapidly and with decision whenever forced to make a move . The Polock was forced almost to a run to keep up with his chief and followed him into the shaft house several steps to the rear . As they dropped down the deep shaft in the fragrant timber cage ? fragrant with the smell of cedar and tamarack ? Koranski propounded a question that had been troubling him for some time past . He felt that in view of the present situation he might well request a few additional confidences . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't much of a man an ' I do n't trust him much . He 's too smart a young fella . ' McKinlock gave a snarl of disgust . He 's another one that I have to watch every minute , but I 'll handle him . He 's a weak-minded little nincompoop that 's going to do just what I aim  | to have him do . He came over here when we first started up , if you remember , and at that time he asked for a job . Said he was the engineer of the Salmon , but that Armitage would n't give him free rein to use his own judgment , and that consequently he was looking for broader fields . Instead of kicking him out of the office , as I felt like doing , I invited him in and gave him a drink and flattered him a little . He told me all he ever knew and all I wanted to find out about the Salmon . I offered to pay him fifty a month to act as our advisory engineer on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try and trespass on us , and of course in that event he would be expected to inform us of it . ' But dey wo n't never trespass on us , boss . Dat side of the Salmon is all worked out . ' I know that , you dumb Polock , but he 's all cocked up at being our secret representative and tells me everything that goes on over there . When Armitage sends him over to make a check survey , he 'll go back and report just what I tell him to report . ' He do n't know about the west drift , does he  - -  yet ? ' Hell , no ! If he knew about that , he 'd die of fright . He 's just a rabbit . We 'll use him till we 're through with him , and then we 'll kick him to hell out of here . When you see him , try and look respectful ? he feeds on that stuff . ' Koranski pressed McKinlock for answers to several other questions , but the big man grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not at all . He was wondering why he had said as much as he  | had , and realized that he was indeed hard-pressed for assistance when his only confidant was an uneducated roughneck . His mind reverted to Blanche Brundage , and he visioned in the ultimate success of this daring venture the fulfillment of a desire that he had nursed for several years . This desire was an insane ambition to marry the Eastern girl . He had met her by chance in New York , when he happened to be weary and disgruntled with his gentleman adventurer existence . She had immediately appealed to him . Some atrophied chord of decency in his hardened soul was touched , and he longed , for the first time in his life , for wealth and social position with which to win her . But after an acquaintance that he had arranged cleverly enough , he soon discovered that she abhorred him . This but inflamed his passion the more , and lacking legitimate means he schemed to accomplish his ends by craft . He had one trick left up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he won now , he felt that he would emerge triumphantly with both the girl and a fortune . Standing with his back against the side of the timber cage , he unconsciously clenched his hands and swore that nothing should defeat him . He was too near to winning . Day by day the red hematite was being lifted up the shaft and carload by carload it was being shipped eastward to increase his credit ? hematite that was rich in iron and low in phosphorus ? and that was not his and consequently highly profitable . This was a great risk , this ore steal that he was perpetrating , but he was a great gambler .
