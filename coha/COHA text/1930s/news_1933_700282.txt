txt Will Rogers Reports On His Turkey Day To the Editor of The New York Times : BEVERLY HILLS , Calif. , Nov. 30 . ? Did n't want to get too enthusiastic about Thanksgiving , tin I saw how it turned out . My old friend W. S. ( Bill ) Hart showed up at my igloo with a " gobbler " that he had shot with two guns . Now if you bring everything , I defy anybody to give you a nicer party than I will . Homer Croy , the writer of " They Had to See Paris , " as hungry as an author can be , was here and Mrs. Florenz Ziegfeld , looking exactly twenty-five years old , and not reducing . Then an outlaw dropped in , but he was only the Crown Prince 's son and the Kaiser 's grandson , Prince Ferdinand . While he got no white meat as in his early childhood , he seemed mighty cheerful and a fine young chap and was satisfied with the wings . None of us had any gold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILL ROGERS .
