txt We confess to a certain liking for Professor HERBERT D. SIMPSON . ? His title crops up now and then in the more abstruse civic literature of the day : " Re " search Associate , Institute for Re " search in Land Economics and Public " Utilities ; Associate Professor of Eco " nomici , Northwestern University . " He keeps a lot of lovely formulae about ' traffic and tall buildings and ? real estate values and the like , all sharp and shining in a glass case . Every now and then he takes one of them out and wields it like a scalpel on some contemporary problem . Some years ago he took on no less an adversary than President COOLIDGE , who , in a perfectly detached way and without a thought of rousing controversy , said something rather disparaging about skyscrapers . The professor thought they had been greatly maligned , and brought out some of his most cutting formulae to prove it . Now he is aiming them at an institution no less sacred than Chicago 's " Bour Mich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one has to wade , as usual , knee-deep in technology and statistics . His article in the current ' Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science is filled with talk Of mobilia and immabilia.  --  and " first differences , " and he turns from a lively contrast between ABRAHAM 'S camels and FORD 'S flivvers as factors in the real estate market to hint at the future elaboration of a " beautiful problem in multiple correlation . " For the present he is content to develop , in a sketchy-way , the thesis that public improvements which have the effect of increasing the " quantity , availability or accessibility " of land for economic uses tend not to increase aggregate land values but to decrease them . He takes Michigan Avenue as his cadaver . Every one in Chicago knows about the Michigan Avenue improvement . ' It includes the widening of the avenue itself , the completion of the " link bridge , " a two-level thoroughfare and double-deck bascule bridge across the Chicago River , and the development of a general boulevard system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the residents of Chicago have been told over and over again that it has added $100,000,000 to property values . Professor SIMPSON does not deny that it added something like that amount to the value of property on the North Side . But he reaches the startling conclusion that this appreciation was at the expense of a much larger depreciation , not less than $600,000,000 , on the South Side . Far . be it from a New Yorker to question this conclusion , which must be left to those who have put on the mantles - of Messrs . BURNHAM , NORTON &lid; WACKER . While awaiting their comment it may not be too presumptuous to suggest that the professor may conceivably be barking at the wrong woodpile . The culprit may be not the avenue or the bridge , but the new cluster of skyscrapers which they fostered . Certainly , this pen will never be used to spatter ink on the Wrigley Building or the Tribune Tower , or any of the other magnificent structures erected by those who , in these latter days , would emulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion of these edifices , and it may be that Mr. SIMPSON has hit on one of them . What if , after all , they do not , at least as at present regulated , add to aggregate real estate values in the community ? That maybe an unorthodox view , but it is one shared by our own regional planners .
