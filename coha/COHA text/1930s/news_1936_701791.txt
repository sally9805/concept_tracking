txt Homeless and without food , thousands of Johnstown 's terror-stricken residents huddled in misery tonight upon the rain-soaked Conemaugh Hills above the city , battered by flood waters from the Conemaugh River and Stony Creek . At least 10,000 fled the city this afternoon and took refuge in the hills as rumors flew that the huge Quemahoning Dam above Johnstown had broken , causing fears of a repetition of the great dam disaster which took more than 2,000 lives here in 1889 . But the dam was found to be holding . Flashlights of State and local police winked and bobbed in the otherwise dark streets while rain , causing fears of a new surge of flood waters , fell upon the receding waters of the overflowed streams . Martial law was proclaimed late tonight as a regiment of National Guardsmen , mobilized from Indiana , Altoona , Greensburg and Somerset . started toward the city under command of Captain George Potts . It was expected here by dawn . In the meantime Mayor Daniel J. Shields made public a series of thirty-day regulations which police were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These provided for a 9 o'clock curfew , with no unaccredited persons permitted on the streets after that hour ; no loitering in the restricted downtown area of about two square miles ; no visitors or sightseers , and observance of the utmost precautions against fire . The Dead Number Six The known dead here numbered six . They were Frank W. Buchanan , a sportsman and authority on wild life , drowned as he left his place of business on Franklin Street ; Hyman Torladsky , a furrier ; Dan ( Reds ) Gallagher , a motorman ; a Mrs. Hummel , who died of shock ; a man named Geer and an unidentified woman . The city counted its loss up to1 $10,000,000 . As the flood waters subsided some of the more venturesome residents went back to their homes and be- gan shoveling silt and debris from their cellars . Robert E. Bondy , Red Cross disaster relief director , set up a field hospital at the Westmont Upper Yoder High School , while CCC cots and blankets were rushed to Roxbury , another suburb , where temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service was restored as the night wore on . But during most of the day and night there were no telephone connections , no city heat , no light , no power . Four of the city 's five main bridges had collapsed into the torrents which last night and early today raced eighteen feet deep in places . Highway , Rail Traffic Halted All of the motor highways into the city were closed . The Pennsylvania Railroad , with two of its tracks washed into the Conemaugh and the other two of the four-track system unsafe , banned rail movement . Only in the matter of the loss of human life did city authorities count the devastation appreciably less terrible than that of the " great flood " of May 31 , 1889 , when 2,235 men , women and children died . Although the water was not more than a foot deep in the streets of Johnstown proper this evening and was rapidly draining off into slimy puddles , houses in near-by Ferndale stood in from six to eight feet of water . While the official death list was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life to range from ten to forty . Governor Earle , who made a brief personal inspection of the city about midday , estimated that the toll eventually would be placed at somewhere between those limits . With about 250 State police and State highway patrolmen already in the city , an additional 280 on the way from barracks and sub-stations as far east as Harrisburg , and 100 deputies supplementing the local force , the situation was kept well in hand pending the arrival of troops . Furthermore , the emergency corps of the Red Cross was in the city , and these workers , with police , were tackling tonight the mest difficult of the immediate questions ? that of distribution of food supplies . This was made difficult by the unreasoning panic which swept the city shortly before 3 o'clock this afternoon when the rumors spread of the breaking of the Quemahoning Dam , which is a gigantic reservoir of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation , sixteeh miles from the city , on Stony Creek . Men and women who were timidly picking their way back into the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heard the rumors and stampeded like frightened cattle . " Run , run for your lives ! " cries went up . " The dam 's broken ! " 11 Repeated assurances of State police that the dam , with its billions of gallons of potential destruction , was intact and in no danger of breaking might as well have been I told to the wind . With nerves at the breaking pointl due to last night 's horror and sleep- ' , less , foodless and heatless hours , the evacuation of the city back to the hills began all over again . Refugees Widely Scattered Thus as food began to pour into the city from all over Cambria County , those for whom it was intended were scattered up and down the valley , in little groups , in unlighted houses and public structures , with no speedy means of transport to carry supplies to them . Those who fled from Moxhan and Ferndale took refuge on the high ground at Prospect and Frankstown . Orders were dispatched to all school buses in Cambria County to proceed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and transport the homeless to the boroughs of Southmont , Westmont and Dale . Four bridges spanning Stony Creek ? the Franklin , Ferndale , Maple Avenue and Riverside spans ? were gone tonight . The sole remaining bridge connecting Johnstown with Conemaugh through the borough of Franklin was so severely damaged that it was expected to collapse momentarily . The Conemaugh roundhouse of the Pennsylvania Railroad was washed out and four locomotives lay tonight half buried in the river . With two of the four main tracks of the Pennsylvania washed out and their roadbeds seriously damaged , the other two are supposed to be unsafe , although there is no traffic in either direction to test them . Three trains which were reported to have left Harrisburg for Altoona were reported as not making any progress . The William Penn Highway in the vicinity of Johnstown was again open , but secondary and rural roads were impassable . In low-lying areas , blocks of concrete had been ripped from the road , and wind-bound macadam and hard-surfaced roads were obliterated in some places .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
