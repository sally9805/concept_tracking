BIG FROGS AND LITTLE FROGS A STORY BY SUSAN ERTZ Wi EN she had published her secoind novel  --  which repeated the discreet success of her first  --  Eunice Maud Raikes joined the New Argosy Club . She asked several people 's advice about it first and , on being told that it could do her no harm , presently found herself a member of the largest and best-known literary society in London . Being extremely diffident , however , she attended none of its dinners . Regularly notices were sent out to her : " The next dinner of the New Argosy Club will take place at the Britannic Hotel , Piccadilly , on such-and-such a date . 7.45 for 8 . " Regularly she said to herself , " This time I really must go , " but as regularly her shyness conquered her . The thought of appearing like a nervous , anonymous little ghost in that blaze of greater and lesser luminaries alarmed her too much and , though it was her privilege to invite a guest , there was no one she cared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordeal . Then , quite suddenly , and to the surprise of her friends , she married a simple , admiring business man named Corry Brewster , who never noticed that she possessed no social gifts and , having read few novels but hers , thought her a genius . With him to uphold and defend her , she resolved to make her first appearance at the next meeting . It happened that on this occasion one of the great , iron-clad literary figures of the day was acting as Chairman and , whether by accident or design or merely to show the democratic nature of the New Argosy Club , Eunice Maud Raikes , upon arrival at the place of assembly , was shocked to find that she was to be seated on his left hand at dinner . When the plan of the tables was shown to her , her knee-joints seemed to loosen and melt , and the roar of talk all about her went far away and then surged back again , trebled in volume . She looked wildly at Corry , only to see on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why not ? " he said . " Very nice for him . Now who do you suppose they 'll put me next to ? I hope it 'll be somebody human . " Corry liked people to be human above all things . It was very nearly all he asked of his fellow-beings . When he heard someone he knew condemned or criticized , he would say , " Oh , I do n't know ; he 's human . " Further study of the plan now revealed that he was placed between a Miss Haro Naguchi  --  the New Argosy was nothing if not international  --  and a lady called , rather cryptically , Mae Moss , " At least they 're not famous , so far as I know , " said Eunice , " so you 're in luck . " " I 'm not afraid of any of them , " said Corry . " Besides , I did n't come here for my own pleasure . You 're the one that matters . " BIG FROGS AND " 1 with I could change with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth from chattering . " 1 do wish I could . I 'd give anything to be sitting next to someone decently obscure . " " Why , what 's the matter ? I thought you 'd always wanted to meet What'shis-name . I thought he was one of your heroes . " " I 'd like just to be introduced to him , " said Eunice . " It 's quite another thing to be put down next to him for two whole hours at dinner . " " All the better , I should think . " " I 'd much rather have been sitting next to you , " she said , loving with a heightened love that safe , comfortable presence . " I wish I 'd asked to be . I did n't know . Lots of husbands and wives do seem to be sitting together . " The crowd , surging and craning and chattering about the board displaying the big plan of the tables , swelled from minute to minute , and as it swelled it pushed the Brewsters into a corner , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them friends were greeting friends and introductions were being made . " Oh , are you really the man who wrote Hypocrite 's Holiday ? I simply adored it . " Or , " I hope you 're coming to the first night of my new play next Thursday . " Stout women and thin ones , plain women and a few pretty ones laughed and chattered and pushed as politely as they could through the crowd , while among the colored shawls and scarves and flounces and silks and velvets the male members of the New Argosy Club looked insignificant and a little apologetic . " Looks to me , " said Corry , " as if writing was a woman 's job . " But Eunicedid n't answer . She could think of nothing but what so unaccountably awaited her , the heavy honor that had been so strangely laid upon her . What would the Great Man he like ? What would he wish to talk about ? Would he know who she was or would she have to tell him ? Not that it would mean anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervousness , her heart thudded unevenly under her best white satin . The palms of her hands were moist , her lips dry . She was , if a wit at all , a bedtime wit . She thought of the things she would like to have said when she was brushing her hair or her teeth , hours after the moment to say them had passed . She missed her opportunities with a regularity that astonished and abashed her . When she met Interesting People she was tongue-tied , or said those things she ought not to have said , and instead of doing herself justice , longed to melt away out of sight and hearing ; to disappear , like hoarfrost before the noonday sun . Only Corry 's serene faith in her put stiffness into her spine and kept her legs from folding at the knees . How , oh how was she to hope to interest the Great Man ? She hated silly women and had a dread of being thought one . She was afraid of being betrayed by her own timid and unreliable tongue into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At last the crowd surged towards the dining room . All about her was the din of talkers trying to make themselves heard through the talk of others . Even the men 's voices sounded strident . " Scene is laid in Tibet , I believe . . . .

A sea of white or gray heads ; black and brown and blond ones among them , but not so many ; a little Chinaman in black silk and blue silk almost lost and smothered in the crowd but smiling politely upward as he was carried along ; a young Irish Republican with a jutting jaw , his straw-colored hair falling into his eyes ; a pretty , eager girl in blue velvet craning her long white neck for a glimpse of some celebrity ; a tall Belgian writer with a marble pale face half hidden in a spreading brown beard ; the Great Man courteously inclining his head to hear the eager twittering of a small , white-haired woman beside him ( " I do wish I knew what she 's talking to him about , " thought Eunice ) ? alI were borne along in the dinnerward tide of chattering humanity . Eunice clung nervously to Corry 's arm , her small pale face looking strained and frightened . " I ca n't bear you to leave me , darling , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You silly girl ! " What 's it all about ? You 're all nerves to-night . This is no more exciting than a City dinner , and heaven knows they 're dull enough . " " Oh , Corry , I wish  --  why did I ? ? " " Here 's my table , number eight . Here 's where we part . You 'd better follow the Great Man as you 're sitting next to him . Off you go , darling . Let go of my arm . Enjoy yourself . " She was swept on , and as the distance between them widened she thought how easy it was to write a hook sitting by oneself in a quiet little room . That was nothing . Then it got published , and sooner or later this sort of thing followed . One was sucked into a whirlpool of strange human beings , and confused and deafened and dizzied and made to talk and to produce a personality that was acceptable to others . She followed the Great Man , fixing her eyes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doom . He had reached his table now . He had found his place , facing the whole length of the room . She saw him pick up her place-card , glance at it , and put it down again . On his right was a tall , generously planned woman in blue at whom Eunice had caught herself staring more than once . So that was the famous Mrs. Breed  --  Constance Breed , the foremost woman novelist of the day . A real personality . So real was it , indeed , so solid , that one felt one could see it and touch it . Whatever happened , Eunice thought , in whatever situation she might find herself , that great , warm , gentle , pervasive , and perfectly reliable personali ty would always be steadily functioning . In bed it would n't alter , in church it would be just the same ; on a lecture platform , in a bus , anywhere . " What would n't I give , " Eunice thought , " to be the owner of a personality like that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People could come and take little bits of it away for souvenirs , and there would always be plenty more . " And then Mrs. Breed leaned forward and , inclining a gracious bust , smiled and bowed to Eunice across the Great Man 's shirtfront , and Eunice , easily captured by that carelessly thrown net , returned the bow with warmth . Mrs. Breed 's gesture , like the slow bending of a proud vessel to meet some wide green valley of the seas , had seemed to say , " I do n't know who you are , strange little woman in white , but you are here , and it is proper and expedient that we should signal to each other in a friendly way , thus establishing a cordial , pleasant atmosphere about us . " The Great Man , after a courteous good-evening to Eunice , was now studying the menu with frowning concentration . Eunice turned to look at the BIG FROGS AND person on her left who had just fitted himself into his seat and saw that it was a stout old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his card , she saw that he was one , and recalled  --  for she read all the reviews  --  that he had written a book on the Battle of Jutland . He had small , agreeable blue eyes and a large , humorous nose . When addressed he placed a big square hand behind his ear and leaned nearer to catch what was said . After he and Eunice had exchanged embarrassingly loud confidences , he admitting that he had not dined away from his home for three years , and Eunice that it was her first big literary dinner , there seemed little else to say . She turned her head and looked cautiously at the Great Man 's profile . It was a profile that photographed well and was worth looking at ; strong , a little bleak , but in its way handsome . The Iips were cold and precise , the chin immensely firm , the fine , domelike forehead noble and forbidding . Opposite her sat the little Chinaman , smiling happily and shyly , and while waiting for his soup he kept his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked very nice , and forced herself to speak . " Do you write books ? " she asked , leaning forward . His smile broadened at once , baring prominent teeth . " No , thank you . Poetry . I write poetry . Not good poetry , I think . Read only in China . Not good enough for Europe . Thank you very much . " " Oh , " she said , " how interesting . " " Thank you , " he said again and smiled at her lovingly . " I once tried to write poetry , " she faltered , " when I was younger . " " Oh , yes , " he said , smiling affectionately . " Very interesting . " And then it struck Eunice that this was n't very brilliant , and that the Great Man probably could n't avoidhearing . So she smiled at the little Chinaman and broke off . Presently the Great Man turned to her . " Turtle soup , " he said , " seems to be inevitably requested and as inevitably granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . " " Oh , " said Eunice , with a nervous little laugh , " is it ? I suppose it is. do n't often go to big dinners . " He looked tolerantly at her and turned to Mrs. Breed . " My dear Constance , I assure you the Lapponicum Flavidum likes the sun . All the Lapponicums like the sun . You were right to put your Sarcococca in the shade , and your Thomsoni will do best in half-shade , but do n't , do n't deny the sun to your Lapponicum . Take my word for it , you 'll regret it if you do . " " Well , but my dearest Henry , " Mrs. Breed said , " I was talking to Brixon only yesterday , and he warned me that , as my rock-garden faced full south , the Lapponicums might get more sun than was good for them . He agrees with you entirely about the Thomsoni and the Sarcococca , however . " Eunice lost the rest of the conversation in the din about her . Everyone was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . She tried to catch a glimpse of Corry , but he was hidden from her by the black bulk of the lady she supposed was Mae Moss . She thought about the Great Man and Mrs.Breed . Henry . . . Constance .. . they 'd probably known each other for years . A great literary friendship . Lovers once perhaps . She peeped at Mrs. Breed 's benign , large-featured face , and thought , yes , quite likely , when she was younger . She looked rather like George Eliot now , or would have looked like her had she worn her hair that way . The Great Man would probablyturn back to her in a moment and then what could she possibly find to talk to himabout ? Lapponicums ? Shedid n't know what they were , His last book ? What would she dare to say about it except that she loved it , and how banal and schoolgirlish that would sound ? The Admiral had ordered hock and , turning to her , he gallantly proffered the bottle . " Now , young lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A nice , dry hock . Would n't harm a baby . My wife wo n't touch it ; the doctors have frightened her , poor dear , but you and I do n't listen to doctors . " " I 'm afraid I do n't drink wine , " said Eunice , raising her voice . " Dear me , dear me , what are young people coming to ? Try a little ; it will do you good . " " Well , " said Eunice , " just a little then . I 'm afraid it 's wasted on me . " He filled her glass and then turned to his wife who was trying to attract his attention . " What 's that , my dear ? Kitty Dalgetty ? Ca n't be . What 'd she be doing in this rogue 's gallery ? Somebody 's guest ? Well , maybe , maybe . I 'll just put on my glasses and have a look . ' Pon my soul , I believe it is . And , my dear , I 'll swear that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all in Malta . " Eunice sat sipping her wine . She wanted to make it last as long as possible . Just a tiny sip , and then presently , another . It gave her something to do , she found , between the courses . She thought of speaking to the little Chinaman again , but could think of nothing to say to him . Then suddenly the Great Man turned to her again . " If all the novelists writing to-day were placed end to end , " he said , " how far do you suppose they 'd reach ? " Feeling a little like Alice Through the Looking Glass , Eunice faltered and said , " Is it a riddle ? Is there an answer ? " " There must be an answer , " he said , " though 1 do n't happen to know it . But it would be a pleasing sight . " She laughed politely , and tried to think of a suitable reply , but such was the effect of his Greatness upon her that her mind was empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied , " it would , would n't it ? " He looked down at her card . " You 'd be one of the endless chain yourself , I suspect . Eunice Maud Raikes . An oddly discreet name . Tell me what you 've written . " " Only two books , " she stammered . " Just novels . I 'm afraid they 're not very good . " " Still , " he said , magnanimously , " only two . 1 think you might be discharged with a caution . " She laughed again and had almost thought of a possible retort when he turned away . " It 's all very well for you , Constance , " she heard him say , " to insist on the importance of the chilli peppers , but your Mrs. Gorme knows how to use them . When I ask Martha to suggest to Mrs. Crawley that a slight flavor of chillies would improve the sauce , she puts in enough to set the Houses of Parliament on fire . The woman has absolutely no idea of moderation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , but I might as well talk to the kitchen wall . " " What an odd conversation , " thought Eunice , and it seemed to her that these famous people were unaccountable and mysterious . She saw that the little Chinaman was smiling at her with a smile that seemed to embrace her and all the world . " Poor Little man , " she thought , " no one 's talking to him either . " And she had just decided to ask him how he liked England when the lady on his right , an earnest-looking young woman in red , addressed a remark to him , and he turned , beaming , to answer her . For some time Eunice busied herself with roast saddle of lamb , then the Great Man spoke to her again with unnerving abruptness . " Would you say , " he demanded , " that there had been a definite improvement in the novel within the last fifty years or merely a change ? Are novels better to-day or merely different ? Is there anyone now writing who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of Dickens or Thackeray ? What do you think ? " Eunice felt relieved . Here at least was something definite to talk about . " Now , do n't be afraid , " she told herself , " tell him what you think . " She said , stammering a little : " I think of course one must read the old writers , it 's part of everyone 's education ; but having read them , I 'd much rather read the work of living authors now . For pleasure , I mean . I mean , if I were to go away for a holiday , I 'd far rather take one of your books with me than a book by Dickory or Thackens. 1 mean , " she said , hurriedly correcting herself and blushing , " I mean Thick ? " " Quite , quite , " he interrupted , his face perfectly grave . " 1 sometimes think myself that I 'm as good as Thackens . About Dickory , I 'm not so sure . I 'm not so sure . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , with the exception , perhaps , of Zolac , or , if you like , Tolstoievsky . But then , of course , Tolstoievsky is ? " Here the waiter intervened , having been sent for earlier . " I asked for Liebfrauenmilth 1921 , " said the Great Man , in gentle reproof , " and you brought me ' 28 . " The waiter apologized and removed the bottle . " My enthusiasm for the things of the present , " he told Eunice , " does not extend itself to hock . 1928 was a very good year , but it will be a better year in 1938 . Yes , Constance ? " And he turned back to Mrs. Breed . Eunice sat sipping her wine , the blushes returning again and again to her cheek at the memory of her silly slip of the tongue . When her glass was empty , the Admiral turned to her . " Here , here , " he said , filling her glass again , " you 're not doing your share . You must n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting on ? " " Very nicely , thanks , " said Eunice , " and I like this wine very much . " " Ah , " he said , nodding , " that 's good , that 's good . We 're having a tremendous argument , the gentleman at the end of the table and myself , about aircraft in war . He 'd like to abolish the Navy . Excuse me , my dear , I must have at him again . " And she listened for a while to a highly technical discussion on the ability or inability of battleships to defend themselves from air attack . Presently the Great Man was addressing her again . He resembled , she thought , a lighthouse , whose dignified revolving beam illumines , ever so often , each object within its range , only to leave it in darkness again . " To what do you attribute , " he asked , " this sudden vogue for the past ? Novelists , biographers , dramatists , they are all taking their little tin shovels down to that vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It should be sweated for , with plenty of midnight oil . What do you think ? " " I really have n't thought about it very much , " said Eunice , and she tried to think of the name of the writer whose historical essays she had so greatly enjoyed , but her memory stubbornly refused to perform the simple , necessary act of producing it for her . It did n't matter , luckily , for the Great Man then proceeded to express his own views without asking her any alarming questions . He then turned abruptly back to Mrs. Breed . " No , Constance , a few minutes ago you made a perfectly unjustifiable attack on my mendacity . I never told them the truthabout it , never . Do you imagine I 've no conscience ? I could see with half an eye that the legs were faked , or at least three of them were , but they 'd paid two hundred pounds for it , and naturally I 'm all in favor of letting them get what pleasure they can out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished she could catch Corry 's eye , and then was glad she could not . He was doubtless imagining that she was enjoying every minute of the evening . Before long the Great Man made one of his sudden pounces in her direction , this time to say : " On the whole then , you approve of this selling of famous men of history at two a penny ? I had n't , somehow , expected it of you . " The waiter bent over him . " Yes , a cigar please . And a double brandy . Constance , you 'll join me in a brandy ? No ? What a pity . Will you , Miss Eunice Maud Raikes ? " " I 've never drunk brandy in my life , " said Eunice , " but I 'd like to try some now . " " Excellent . We 'll pledge each other 's health . In a few minutes I shall rise to propose the health of the King . After that I shall make a short speech . And after that you shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hucksters of history , these barrow-pushers and street-hawkers of whom we were speaking . " " I 'm afraid I do n't know very much about it , " said Eunice , in whose mind , at moments of stress , nothing but the simple truth presented itself . " Neither do they , so you 're in a very strong position . Yes , Constance , we said Tuesday . Yes , yes , I 'm quite sure . Very well , I 'll write it down . " He took his engagement book out of his pocket , and glancing at it out of the tail of her eye , Eunice saw that it was scored and blackened with small entries . He wrote , and spoke the words aloud as he wrote them , " Tuesday , at 3.45 . Go with Constance to Kippler 's to choose a dachshund . " When , later , he got up to propose the health of the King , Eunice drank it in brandy . He then made a speech which she thought witty , agreeable , and adroit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the other by the elderly founder of the Club . Then everyone was free to leave his seat , and at once the Great Man was surrounded . Eunice , after vainly lingering with the idea of saying a polite good-night , presently slipped away and went in search of Corry . The fumes of hock and brandy were slowly mounting to her head , but not sufficiently to inconvenience her . Instead she felt a sort of sublime complacence stealing over her , a sweet indifference , a careless acceptance of all things , even of her own shortcomings . What was there to have made such a fuss about ? What on earth did it all matter ? She caught sight of Corry and moved serenely in his direction , hardly noticing the many obstacles in her way . Voices , colors , lights all blared and blinded and deafened . Although cannoned this way and that , her expression of bland complacence never altered . Corry saw her and came forward to meet her . " Hello , " he said . " Had a good time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past him . " I did n't have a had time , I liked my little Jap . She was quite human . The other was n't so good . How did you get on with old What's-his-name ? " " Beautifully . " " Want to go home now , darling , or would you like to stay for a bit ? " " Home , " she said . " Well , 1 do n't suppose there 's a chance of your seeing the Great Man again . There 's a mob around him . Run along then and get your coat while I get a taxi . "
