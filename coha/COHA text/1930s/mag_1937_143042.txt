At the foot of San Francisco 's Hyde Street stands the bleak , red North Beach warehouse of big California Packing Corp . Last October the company closed the warehouse , discharging 75 members of Harry Bridges ' Longshoremen &; Warehousemen 's Union . The company said it was a permanent shutdown , the warehousemen a lockout . Whatever it was the warehouse has been closed ever since . <P> Fortnight ago , wanting to remove some of its stored Del Monte canned goods , California Packing dispatched a fleet of trucks manned by members of the Teamsters Union , which on the West Coast is bossed by A. F. of L. 's beefy Dave Beck , " Tsar of Seattle Labor " and a sworn enemy of Harry Bridges . Promptly hustled to the warehouse was a crew of Bridges ' unionists to picket not the warehouse but the Beck teamsters . <P> Instanter Dave Beck declared war , ordering his teamsters to cease trucking all goods handled by the Bridges longshoremen-a virtual embargo of the entire San Francisco waterfront . Exceptions were made for such things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the original warehousemen-California Packing squabble . For pugnacious Dave Beck it had served its purpose as a labor Sarajevo . What started as a local warehouse squabble was by last week a major labor battle , involving the whole of San Francisco , threatening the whole Pacific Coast . <P> The real stake in this war of Labor against Labor was jurisdictional possession of the West Coast warehousemen , who were ignored by Teamster Beck until Longshoreman Bridges in his " inland march " started to organize them . Today he has 11,000 in the C. I. O. camp . Meantime Dave Beck got the A. F. of L. to award jurisdiction over warehousemen to the teamsters , a meaningless gesture to Harry Bridges , who is now West Coast director for C. I. O. Longshoreman Bridges offered last week to settle the dispute by a National Labor Relations Board election but Teamster Beck , having only a handful of warehousemen signed up , flatly refused . " This , " cried he , " is a showdown fight . We 'll close every port on the Pacific Coast where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " rasped Longshoreman Bridges , " not only want a labor war but demand it . . . . " <P> Meanwhile with no trucks to cart the goods away from the waterfront , inbound cargoes piled up on the San Francisco docks . Warehousemen and longshoremen continued to work but jobs dwindled as the available storage space gradually filled up , and a delegation of longshoremen 's wives waited on San Francisco 's Mayor Rossi with pleas to end the war . When shippers started to direct cargoes to Oakland and other Bay ports , Beck simply widened his embargo . Outbound freight was not hit so hard because it moves to the docks largely by rail , not trucks .
